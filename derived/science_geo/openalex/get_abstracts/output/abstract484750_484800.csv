https://openalex.org/W2019335338,"Glucose is a critical component in the proinflammatory response of macrophages (MΦs). However, the contribution of glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the mechanisms regulating subsequent glucose metabolism in the inflammatory response are not well understood. Because MΦs contribute to obesity-induced inflammation, it is important to understand how substrate metabolism may alter inflammatory function. We report that GLUT1 (SLC2A1) is the primary rate-limiting glucose transporter on proinflammatory-polarized MΦs. Furthermore, in high fat diet-fed rodents, MΦs in crown-like structures and inflammatory loci in adipose and liver, respectively, stain positively for GLUT1. We hypothesized that metabolic reprogramming via increased glucose availability could modulate the MΦ inflammatory response. To increase glucose uptake, we stably overexpressed the GLUT1 transporter in RAW264.7 MΦs (GLUT1-OE MΦs). Cellular bioenergetics analysis, metabolomics, and radiotracer studies demonstrated that GLUT1 overexpression resulted in elevated glucose uptake and metabolism, increased pentose phosphate pathway intermediates, with a complimentary reduction in cellular oxygen consumption rates. Gene expression and proteome profiling analysis revealed that GLUT1-OE MΦs demonstrated a hyperinflammatory state characterized by elevated secretion of inflammatory mediators and that this effect could be blunted by pharmacologic inhibition of glycolysis. Finally, reactive oxygen species production and evidence of oxidative stress were significantly enhanced in GLUT1-OE MΦs; antioxidant treatment blunted the expression of inflammatory mediators such as PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), suggesting that glucose-mediated oxidative stress was driving the proinflammatory response. Our results indicate that increased utilization of glucose induced a ROS-driven proinflammatory phenotype in MΦs, which may play an integral role in the promotion of obesity-associated insulin resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2078081719,"Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) is a member of the bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein family. It binds to acetylated histone tails via its tandem bromodomains BD1 and BD2 and forms a complex with the positive transcription elongation factor b, which controls phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, ultimately leading to stimulation of transcription elongation. An essential role of BRD4 in cell proliferation and cancer growth has been reported in several recent studies. We analyzed the binding of BRD4 BD1 and BD2 to different partners and showed that the strongest interactions took place with di- and tetra-acetylated peptides derived from the histone 4 N-terminal tail. We also found that several histone 4 residues neighboring the acetylated lysines significantly influenced binding. We generated 10 different BRD4 BD1 mutants and analyzed their affinities to acetylated histone tails and to the BET inhibitor JQ1 using several complementary biochemical and biophysical methods. The impact of these mutations was confirmed in a cellular environment. Altogether, the results show that Trp-81, Tyr-97, Asn-140, and Met-149 play similarly important roles in the recognition of acetylated histones and JQ1. Pro-82, Leu-94, Asp-145, and Ile-146 have a more differentiated role, suggesting that different kinds of interactions take place and that resistance mutations compatible with BRD4 function are possible. Our study extends the knowledge on the contribution of individual BRD4 amino acids to histone and JQ1 binding and may help in the design of new BET antagonists with improved pharmacological properties."

Dead and live biomass of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa was used to analyze the equilibrium and kinetics of copper biosorption by the yeast in function of the initial metal concentration, contact time, pH, temperature, agitation and inoculum volume. Dead biomass exhibited the highest biosorption capacity of copper, 26.2 mg g(-1), which was achieved within 60 min of contact, at pH 5.0, temperature of 30°C, and agitation speed of 150 rpm. The equilibrium data were best described by the Langmuir isotherm and Kinetic analysis indicated a pseudo-second-order model. The average size, morphology and location of NPs biosynthesized by the yeast were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The shape of the intracellularly synthesized NPs was mainly spherical, with an average size of 10.5 nm. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the copper NPs confirmed the formation of metallic copper. The dead biomass of Rhodotorula mucilaginosa may be considered an efficiently bioprocess, being fast and low-cost to production of copper nanoparticles and also a probably nano-adsorbent of this metal ion in wastewater in bioremediation process."

This process is subject to reversible corruption by fluoroquinolones, antibacterials that form drug-enzyme-DNA complexes in which the DNA is broken. The complexes, called cleaved complexes because of the presence of DNA breaks, have been crystallized and found to have the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring system facing the GyrB/ParE subunits. As expected from x-ray crystallography, a thiol-reactive, C-7-modified chloroacetyl derivative of ciprofloxacin (Cip-AcCl) formed cross-linked cleaved complexes with mutant GyrB-Cys466 gyrase as evidenced by resistance to reversal by both EDTA and thermal treatments. Surprisingly, cross-linking was also readily seen with complexes formed by mutant GyrA-G81C gyrase, thereby revealing a novel drug-gyrase interaction not observed in crystal structures. The cross-link between fluoroquinolone and GyrA-G81C gyrase correlated with exceptional bacteriostatic activity for Cip-AcCl with a quinolone-resistant GyrA-G81C variant of Escherichia coli and its Mycobacterium smegmatis equivalent (GyrA-G89C). Cip-AcCl-mediated, irreversible inhibition of DNA replication provided further evidence for a GyrA-drug cross-link. Collectively these data establish the existence of interactions between the fluoroquinolone C-7 ring and both GyrA and GyrB. Because the GyrA-Gly81 and GyrB-Glu466 residues are far apart (17 Å) in the crystal structure of cleaved complexes, two modes of quinolone binding must exist. The presence of two binding modes raises the possibility that multiple quinolone-enzyme-DNA complexes can form, a discovery that opens new avenues for exploring and exploiting relationships between drug structure and activity with type II DNA topoisomerases.

We report here the crystal structure of human 15-LOX-2 in complex with an inhibitor that appears to bind as a substrate mimic. 15-LOX-2 contains a long loop, composed of hydrophobic amino acids, which projects from the amino-terminal membrane-binding domain. The loop is flanked by two Ca2+-binding sites that confer Ca2+-dependent membrane binding. A comparison of the human 15-LOX-2 and 5-LOX structures reveals similarities at the active sites, as well striking differences that can be exploited for design of isoform-selective inhibitors.

https://openalex.org/W2046535835,"Connectivity models are useful tools that improve the ability of researchers and managers to plan land use for conservation and preservation. Most connectivity models function in a point-to-point or patch-to-patch fashion, limiting their use for assessing connectivity over very large areas. In large or highly fragmented systems, there may be so many habitat patches of interest that assessing connectivity among all possible combinations is prohibitive. To overcome these conceptual and practical limitations, we hypothesized that minor adaptation of the Circuitscape model can allow the creation of omnidirectional connectivity maps illustrating flow paths and variations in the ease of travel across a large study area. We tested this hypothesis in a 24,300 km2 study area centered on the Montérégie region near Montréal, Québec. We executed the circuit model in overlapping tiles covering the study region. Current was passed across the surface of each tile in orthogonal directions, and then the tiles were reassembled to create directional and omnidirectional maps of connectivity. The resulting mosaics provide a continuous view of connectivity in the entire study area at the full original resolution. We quantified differences between mosaics created using different tile and buffer sizes and developed a measure of the prominence of seams in mosaics formed with this approach. The mosaics clearly show variations in current flow driven by subtle aspects of landscape composition and configuration. Shown prominently in mosaics are pinch points, narrow corridors where organisms appear to be required to traverse when moving through the landscape. Using modest computational resources, these continuous, fine-scale maps of nearly unlimited size allow the identification of movement paths and barriers that affect connectivity. This effort develops a powerful new application of circuit models by pinpointing areas of importance for conservation, broadening the potential for addressing intriguing questions about resource use, animal distribution, and movement."
https://openalex.org/W2085785895,"Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) play a crucial role in the formation of the nodes of Ranvier and in the rapid propagation of the nerve impulses along myelinated axons. These CAMs are the targets of autoimmunity in inflammatory neuropathies. We recently showed that a subgroup of patients with aggressive chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) shows autoantibodies to contactin (1). The complex of contactin·Caspr·neurofascin-155 (NF155) enables the formation of paranodal junctions, suggesting that antibody attack against paranodes may participate in the severity of CIDP. In the present study, we mapped the molecular determinants of contactin targeted by the autoantibodies. In three patients, immunoreactivity was directed against the Ig domains of contactin and was dependent on N-glycans. The serum of one patient was selectively directed against contactin bearing mannose-rich N-glycans. Strikingly, the oligomannose type sugars of contactin are required for association with its glial partner NF155 (2). To investigate precisely the role of contactin N-glycans, we have mutated each of the nine consensus N-glycosylation sites independently. We found that the mutation of three sites (N467Q/N473Q/N494Q) in Ig domain 5 of contactin prevented soluble NF155-Fc binding. In contrast, these mutations did not abolish cis-association with Caspr. Next, we showed that the cluster of N-glycosylation sites (Asn-467, Asn-473, and Asn-494) was required for immunoreactivity in one patient. Using cell aggregation assays, we showed that the IgGs from the four CIDP patients prevented adhesive interaction between contactin·Caspr and NF155. Importantly, we showed that the anti-contactin autoantibodies induced alteration of paranodal junctions in myelinated neuronal culture. These results strongly suggest that antibodies to CAMs may be pathogenic and induce demyelination via functional blocking activity."
https://openalex.org/W2152228425,"Activation of uterine inflammatory pathways leads to preterm labor (PTL), associated with high rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. The transcription factors nuclear factor κB (NFκB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1) regulate key proinflammatory and procontractile genes involved in normal labor and PTL. Here we show that (NFκB) activation normally occurs in the mouse myometrium at gestation day E18, prior to labor, whereas AP-1 and JNK activation occurs at labor onset. Where labor was induced using the progesterone receptor antagonist RU486, NFkB and AP-1/JNK activation both occurred at the time of labor (20 h compared to 60 h in DMSO-treated controls). Using an LPS (Escherichia coli: serotype O111)-induced PTL model that selectively activates AP-1 but not NFkB, we show that myometrial AP-1 activation drives production of cytokines (Il-6, Il-8, and Il-1β), metalloproteinases (Mmp3 and Mmp10), and procontractile proteins (Cox-2 and Cx43) resulting in PTL after 7 h. Protein levels of CX43 and IL-1β, and IL-1β cleavage, were increased following LPS-induced activation of AP-1. Inhibition of JNK by SP600125 (30 mg/kg) delayed PTL by 6 h (7.5 vs. 13.5 h P<0.05). Our data reveal that (NFκB) activation is not a functional requirement for infection/inflammation-induced preterm labor and that AP-1 activation is sufficient to drive inflammatory pathways that cause PTL.—MacIntyre, D.

https://openalex.org/W2030987469,"Synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) from oxaloacetate is an absolute requirement for gluconeogenesis from mitochondrial substrates. Generally, this reaction has solely been attributed to the cytosolic isoform of PEPCK (PEPCK-C), although loss of the mitochondrial isoform (PEPCK-M) has never been assessed. Despite catalyzing the same reaction, to date the only significant role reported in mammals for the mitochondrial isoform is as a glucose sensor necessary for insulin secretion. We hypothesized that this nutrient-sensing mitochondrial GTP-dependent pathway contributes importantly to gluconeogenesis. PEPCK-M was acutely silenced in gluconeogenic tissues of rats using antisense oligonucleotides both in vivo and in isolated hepatocytes. Silencing PEPCK-M lowers plasma glucose, insulin, and triglycerides, reduces white adipose, and depletes hepatic glycogen, but raises lactate. There is a switch of gluconeogenic substrate preference to glycerol that quantitatively accounts for a third of glucose production. In contrast to the severe mitochondrial deficiency characteristic of PEPCK-C knock-out livers, hepatocytes from PEPCK-M-deficient livers maintained normal oxidative function. Consistent with its predicted role, gluconeogenesis rates from hepatocytes lacking PEPCK-M are severely reduced for lactate, alanine, and glutamine, but not for pyruvate and glycerol. Thus, PEPCK-M has a direct role in fasted and fed glucose homeostasis, and this mitochondrial GTP-dependent pathway should be reconsidered for its involvement in both normal and diabetic metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2025394363,"Cardiac TRPM2 channels were activated by intracellular adenosine diphosphate-ribose and blocked by flufenamic acid. In adult cardiac myocytes the ratio of GCa to GNa of TRPM2 channels was 0.56 ± 0.02. To explore the cellular mechanisms by which TRPM2 channels protect against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, we analyzed proteomes from WT and TRPM2 KO hearts subjected to I/R. The canonical pathways that exhibited the largest difference between WT-I/R and KO-I/R hearts were mitochondrial dysfunction and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Complexes I, III, and IV were down-regulated, whereas complexes II and V were up-regulated in KO-I/R compared with WT-I/R hearts. Western blots confirmed reduced expression of the Complex I subunit and other mitochondria-associated proteins in KO-I/R hearts. Bioenergetic analyses revealed that KO myocytes had a lower mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, ATP levels, and O2 consumption but higher mitochondrial superoxide levels. Additionally, mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) currents were lower in KO myocytes, indicating reduced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was likely due to both lower ψm and MCU activity. Similar to isolated myocytes, O2 consumption and ATP levels were also reduced in KO hearts. Under a simulated I/R model, aberrant mitochondrial bioenergetics was exacerbated in KO myocytes. Reactive oxygen species levels were also significantly higher in KO-I/R compared with WT-I/R heart slices, consistent with mitochondrial dysfunction in KO-I/R hearts.

A H2O2-induced [Ca2+]i increase in WT myocytes is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and inhibited by clotrimazole. These observations provide support that TRPM2 channels are functional in adult cardiac myocytes. In addition, in contrast to the classical paradigm in which enhanced Ca2+ signaling with TRPM2 activation in pathological states contributes to cell injury and death (13Sumoza-Toledo A. Penner R.

We found that loss of TRPM2 in cardiac myocytes perturbed mitochondrial proteomes and mitochondrial function. Additionally, TRPM2 KO hearts subjected to I/R exhibited exacerbation of mitochondrial malfunction. Global TRPM2 KO mice were generated as described previously (5Miller B.A. Wang J.

For brevity, throughout the manuscript TRPM2 knock-out is abbreviated to KO whether applied to mice, hearts, myocytes, or LV homogenates. Homozygous adult littermates ∼8–10 weeks old were used in this study. Mice were housed and fed on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle in either the Temple University or the Pennsylvania State University animal facility supervised by full-time veterinarian staff members. Standard care was provided to all mice used for experiments. All protocols and procedures applied to the mice in this study were approved and supervised by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at Temple University and the Pennsylvania State University. Cardiac myocytes were isolated from the LV free wall and septum of WT and KO mice according to the protocol of Zhou et al. (14Zhou Y.Y. Wang S.Q. Zhu W.Z. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B.K. Ziman B. Wang S.

Fire-polished pipettes (tip diameter 4–6 μm) with resistances of 0.8–1.4 megaohms when filled with pipette solutions were used. Pipette solution contained 110 mm CsCl, 20 mm triethylammonium chloride, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 5 mm MgATP, pH 7.2, and bathing solution contained 127 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm CsCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 4 mm 4-aminopyridine, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 15 mm glucose, and 0.001 mm verapamil, pH 7.4. Our solutions are designed to minimize L-type Ca2+ current, Na+-K+-ATPase current, Na+/Ca2+ exchange current, and potassium currents. Freshly isolated mouse LV myocytes were held at −70 mV. To inactivate fast inward Na+ current, myocytes were held at −40 mV before application of voltage ramp (+100 to −100 mV; 500 mV/s). In some experiments, ADPR (300 μm) was included in pipette solutions to activate TRPM2 channels (21Kolisek M. Beck A. Fleig A. Penner R. Cyclic ADP-ribose and hydrogen peroxide synergize with ADP-ribose in the activation of TRPM2 channels.Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In other experiments, after full activation of TRPM2 channels by ADPR, flufenamic acid (0.5 mm) was added to the extracellular medium to inhibit TRPM2 currents (22Hill K. Benham C.D. McNulty S. Randall A.D. Flufenamic acid is a pH-dependent antagonist of TRPM2 channels.Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To estimate GCa/GNa, WT myocytes were voltage-clamped at −80 mV. Pipette solution was identical to that used above and contained ADPR. Extracellular solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, and 15 mm glucose, pH 7.4. After break-in, steady-state inward Na+ currents were obtained at an Em of −80, −90, and −100 mV. Extracellular solution was then changed to one containing 110 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 15 mm glucose, pH 7.4. Steady-state inward Ca2+ currents were obtained at an Em of −80, −90, and −100 mV from the same myocyte. By Ohm's law, Em − Erev = I/G. Taking derivatives, ΔI/ΔEm = G. GCa/GNa is given by the ratio of the slopes of I versus Em plots with Ca2+ or Na+ as the permeant ion. I/R surgery was performed as previously described (23Gao E. Lei Y.H. Shang X. Huang Z.M. Zuo L.

Briefly, male WT and KO mice (8–10 weeks) were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and the heart was exposed through a left thoracotomy at the fifth intercostal space. The slipknot was tied around the left anterior descending coronary artery 2–3 mm from its origin, and the heart was immediately returned to the chest cavity followed by evacuation of pneumothorax and closure of muscle and skin layers. The slipknot was released after 30 min of ischemia to allow reperfusion. Sham-operated animals were subjected to the same surgical procedure except that the slipknot was not tied. Animals recovered from anesthesia within 5 min after the completion of surgery and received ibuprofen (10 mg/50 ml drinking water) for 48 h as post-surgery analgesia. Studies on survivors were performed on day 3 post-surgery. Label-free proteomics analysis was performed using GeLC-MS/MS technology. To enhance the dynamic range of the identified proteins in this discovery phase study, the pooled LV samples from WT-I/R (n = 4) and KO-I/R (n = 4) were fractionated into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and organelle fractions. Extracted proteins in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer were processed for GeLC-MS/MS analysis as previously described (25Barrero C.A. Perez-Leal O. Aksoy M. Moncada C. Ji R. Lopez Y. Mallilankaraman K. Madesh M. Criner G.J. Kelsen S.G. Merali S. Histone 3.3 participates in a self-sustaining cascade of apoptosis that contributes to the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2013; 188: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, nanoelectrospray ionization tandem MS was performed using a Brukers HCT Ultra ion trap mass spectrometer. Nanoelectrospray ionization was delivered using a distal-coating spray Silica tip (internal diameter (ID) 20 μm, tip inner ID 10 μm, New Objective) at a spray voltage of −1300 V. Automatic switching between MS and MS/MS modes was used. MS/MS fragmentation was performed on the two most abundant ions on each spectrum using collision-induced dissociation with active exclusion (excluded after 2 spectra and released after 2 min). The complete system was fully controlled by HyStar 3.1 software. Mass spectra processing was performed using Bruker Daltonics esquire 6.1 DataAnalysis (Version 3.4). The generated de-isotoped peak list was submitted to an in-house Mascot server 2.2.07 for searching against the Mus musculus Swiss-Prot database (Version 2013_01; 538,849 sequences, 191,337,357 residues). Mascot search parameters were set as follows: enzyme, trypsin with maximal 2 missed cleavages; fixed modification, cysteine carboxymethylation; variable modification, methionine oxidation; 0.45-Da mass tolerance for precursor peptide ions; 0.6 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. All peptides matches were filtered using an ion score cutoff of 30. In each MS/MS spectrum a total of at least 4 b- and y-ions were observed. Label free quantitation was performed in Mascot Distiller using an average protein ratio, minimum 1 peptide with unique sequence, and 0.05 of significant threshold, and the results were analyzed with MS Data Miner (26Dyrlund T.F. Poulsen E.T. Scavenius C. Sanggaard K.W. Enghild J.J. MS data miner. A web-based software tool to analyze, compare, and share mass spectrometry protein identifications.Proteomics. 2012; 12: 2792-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Label-free quantified proteins with higher than a 2-fold increase were selected and clustered by biological functions. To identify the biological networks of differentially expressed proteins, we performed a standard network analysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software as previously described (27Barrero C.A. Datta P.K. Sen S. Deshmane S. Amini S. Khalili K. Merali S. HIV-1 Vpr modulates macrophage metabolic pathways. A SILAC-based quantitative analysis.PloS ONE. 2013; 8: e68376Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). To build the network, the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software queries the Ingenuity knowledge database for physical and functional interactions between the submitted proteins and all other proteins in the database. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis was optimized to include up to 35 proteins in a network. Differentially expressed proteins were input from an Excel file containing the protein accession numbers. Pieces of mouse heart apices were homogenized (hand-held homogenizer) in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4, and supplemented with Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) and Phosphatase Inhibitors (Sigma). Homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Hybond-C-Extra (Amersham Biosciences). Blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% milk and probed overnight at 4 °C with anti-NDUFA4L2 (1:1,000, Abcam), anti-BNIP3 (1:750, Abcam), anti-MTFP1 (1:200, Santa Cruz), or anti-calsequestrin (1:15,000, Fitzgerald). Blots were washed and probed with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (1:2,000, Amersham Biosciences). Enhanced chemiluminescence was used for signal detection. Intensity of the bands was quantitated with densitometry and normalized to that of calsequestrin (loading control). Hearts from male WT and KO mice were subjected to 30 min of ischemia followed by 30 min of reperfusion or underwent sham operation. LV cross-sections (2 mm) from freshly isolated mouse hearts were equilibrated in Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer (30 min; 37 °C), stained with DHE (30 μm), and incubated in the dark (30 min) with gentle rotation (28Cheng Z.

DHE-stained LV sections were imaged with a Carl Zeiss 710 multiphoton confocal microscope (10× objective; 561-nm excitation). ZEN software was used to collect and analyze confocal images of each section and generate 2.5-dimensional heatmap plots of mean DHE intensity. To simulate I/R in vitro, LV myocytes isolated from WT and KO hearts were exposed to either 21% O2, 5% CO2 (normoxia) or 1%O2, 5% CO2 (hypoxia) for 2 h followed by 30 min of reoxygenation (5Miller B.A. Wang J.

After gentle centrifugation, cardiac myocytes were transferred to an intracellular-like medium containing 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 20 mm HEPES-Tris, 2 μg/ml thapsigargin, 80 μg/ml digitonin, pH 7.2, and protease inhibitors (EDTA-free complete tablets, Roche Applied Science). Permeabilized myocytes were supplemented with succinate (10 mm) and gently stirred. Fura-FF (0.5 μm) was added at 0 s, and JC-1 (800 nm; both Molecular Probes) was added at 20 s to measure extra-mitochondrial Ca2+ and Δψm, respectively. Fluorescence signals were monitored in a temperature-controlled (37 °C) multiwavelength-excitation and dual wavelength-emission spectrofluorometer (Delta RAM, Photon Technology Int.) using 490-nm excitation (ex)/535-nm emission (em) for the monomer, 570-nm ex/595-nm em for"
https://openalex.org/W2049778626,"Lipid asymmetry, the difference in lipid distribution across the lipid bilayer, is one of the most important features of eukaryotic cellular membranes. However, commonly used model membrane vesicles cannot provide control of lipid distribution between inner and outer leaflets. We recently developed methods to prepare asymmetric model membrane vesicles, but facile incorporation of a highly controlled level of cholesterol was not possible. In this study, using hydroxypropyl-α-cyclodextrin based lipid exchange, a simple method was devised to prepare large unilamellar model membrane vesicles that closely resemble mammalian plasma membranes in terms of their lipid composition and asymmetry (sphingomyelin (SM) and/or phosphatidylcholine (PC) outside/phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) inside), and in which cholesterol content can be readily varied between 0 and 50 mol%. We call these model membranes “artificial plasma membrane mimicking” (“PMm”) vesicles. Asymmetry was confirmed by both chemical labeling and measurement of the amount of externally-exposed anionic lipid. These vesicles should be superior and more realistic model membranes for studies of lipid-lipid and lipid-protein interaction in a lipid environment that resembles that of mammalian plasma membranes."

Site-directed mutagenesis, COS-7 cell transfection, and in vitro import studies in isolated mitochondria showed that a positively charged domain at residues 41–48 of human CYP1B1 is part of the mitochondrial (mt) import signal. Ala scanning mutations showed that the Ser protease cleavage site resides between residues 37 and 41 of human CYP1B1. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) treatment induced oxidative stress, mitochondrial respiratory defects, and mtDNA damage that was attenuated by a CYP1B1-specific inhibitor, 2,3,4,5-tetramethoxystilbene. In support, the mitochondrial CYP1B1 supported by mitochondrial ferredoxin (adrenodoxin) and ferredoxin reductase showed high aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity. Administration of benzo[a]pyrene or 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin induced similar mitochondrial functional abnormalities and oxidative stress in the lungs of wild-type mice and Cyp1a1/1a2-null mice, but the effects were markedly blunted in Cyp1b1-null mice. These results confirm a role for CYP1B1 in inducing PAH-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction. The role of mitochondrial CYP1B1 was assessed using A549 lung epithelial cells stably expressing shRNA against NADPH-cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase or mitochondrial adrenodoxin.

The human CYP1B1 gene has been implicated in playing a prominent role in multi-tissue carcinogenesis, and CYP1B1 knock-out mice (Cyp1b1-null) displayed a markedly reduced incidence of 7,12-dimethlybenz[a]anthracene-induced lymphomas (21.Buters J.T.

We hypothesized that the 10–15 amino acids immediately past the ER targeting and membrane anchor region, rich in positively charged residues in various inducible and constitutively expressed CYPs, function as cryptic mitochondria targeting signals that are activated by physiological factors.

In this study, we show that CYP1B1 contains a chimeric signal similar to that of CYP1A1 and is also bimodally targeted to mitochondria. We show that nascent CYP1B1 protein is processed in the cytosol between amino acid residues 38 and 41 (of the nascent protein) for activating the cryptic signal, suggesting the conservation of signal activation and targeting mechanism for the CYP1 family proteins. Furthermore, using knock-out animal models, we show that CYP1B1 plays a major role in BaP and TCDD-mediated mitochondrial respiratory defects, overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and membrane damage in the pulmonary tissue. Use of A549 lung epithelial cells expressing shRNA against NPR and Adx show that mitochondrial CYP1B1 is likely to be responsible for the BaP- and TCDD-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Polyclonal antibodies to human CYP1B1 (in rabbit), porin (in rabbit), and SDH (in mouse) were purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Antibodies to human cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (CcOI) (anti-mouse), human subunit Vb (CcOVb) (anti-mouse), and human cytochrome oxidase IVi1 (CcO IVi1) (anti-rabbit) were from Mitosciences (Eugene, OR). Antibodies raised against human NPR (anti-mouse) and TOM20 (anti-rabbit) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. All animal procedures were carried out in compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of vertebrate animals and were approved by the University of Pennsylvania's IACUC for the use of animals. Male C57BL/6N WT mice and CYP1B1 knock-out (Cyp1b1-null) mice (20–25 g) received BaP (12.5 mg/kg body weight) daily for 14 days by oral gavage and TCDD (30 μg/kg body weight) daily for 3 days. The rationale for oral administration of BaP was based on the observation by Nebert and co-workers (46.Shi Z. Dragin N. Miller M.L. Stringer K.F. Johansson E. Chen J. Uno S. Gonzalez F.J. Rubio C.A. Nebert D.W. Oral benzo[a]pyrene-induced cancer: two distinct types in different target organs depend on the mouse Cyp1 genotype.Int. J.

The control mice received equivalent volumes of corn oil. The animals were killed by CO2 asphyxiation 24 h after the last gavage/injection and perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline. The lungs were then rapidly removed and rinsed with saline, and the lung microsomes and mitochondria were isolated as described previously (47.Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Raza H. Avadhani N.G.

The mitochondrial and microsomal isolates were suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 mm PMSF and used for various assays. Human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells (ATCC HTB-22TM) were grown in Dulbecco's Eagle's minimum essential medium (DMEM) with 0.01 mg/ml bovine insulin, 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Human lung carcinoma A549 cells (ATCC CCL-185) and African Green Monkey Kidney COS-7 cells (ATCC CRL-1651) were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum (v/v) with 1% (w/v) penicillin/streptomycin added. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere made of 5% CO2 and 95% air (v/v). DMSO, when added, was at a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v), which does not affect cellular functions and integrity. BaP, at a concentration of 20 μm, was used for the induction of CYP1B1. 2,3,4,5-Tetramethoxystilbene (TMS), a CYP1B1-selective inhibitor, was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml. Proadifen hydrochloride (SKF525A), a general inhibitor of CYPs, was used at a concentration of 1 mm. Control plates were treated with an equivalent volume of 0.1% DMSO (v/v) alone. While handling BaP and TCDD, personnel were required to observe safe handling procedures, and almost all procedures dealing with these chemicals were carried out in a hood. Personnel were required to wear lab coats, gloves, bonnets, and masks at all times, and contaminated materials were collected and stored safely for disposal by the Hazardous Waste Unit (EHRS) of the University. Full-length CYP1B1 (WT) was amplified from cDNA isolated from TCDD-treated A549 human lung carcinoma cells in fragments and joined by overlap PCR. The N-terminal truncations (+34, +54, and +141) were generated by PCR amplification using appropriate primers containing cloning sites. All constructs were cloned in HindIII and XbaI sites in PCDNA3.1 for in vitro import and into a PCMV4 vector for cell transfection studies. All constructs were also engineered to contain an ATG codon preceded by a Kozak consensus sequence. The mouse dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) cDNA was fused in-frame through a BamHI linker to the N terminus of WT CYP1B1, referred to hereafter as DHFR-1B1, and was cloned into a PCMV4 vector. The mitochondrial targeting mutants Rmut1 and Rmut2 were generated using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). In Rmut1, Arg residues at position 41 and positions 43–45 were mutated to Ala. In Rmut2, Arg residues at positions 43–45 and 48 were mutated to Ala for identifying the mitochondrial targeting signal. Ala substitutions at the 37/38(M1), 38/39(M2), 39/40(M3), and 40/41(M4) sites were also carried out in CYP1B1 WT and DHFR-CYP1B1 for characterizing the putative protease-processing sites.

https://openalex.org/W2028472480,"Phytophthora plurivora causes severe damage on Fagus sylvatica and is responsible for the extensive decline of European Beech throughout Europe. Unfortunately, no effective treatment against this disease is available. Phosphite (Phi) is known to protect plants against Phytophthora species; however, its mode of action towards P. plurivora is still unknown. To discover the effect of Phi on root infection, leaves were sprayed with Phi and roots were subsequently inoculated with P. plurivora zoospores. Seedling physiology, defense responses, colonization of root tissue by the pathogen and mortality were monitored. Additionally the Phi concentration in roots was quantified. Finally, the effect of Phi on mycelial growth and zoospore formation was recorded. Phi treatment was remarkably efficient in protecting beech against P. plurivora; all Phi treated plants survived infection. Phi treated and infected seedlings showed a strong up-regulation of several defense genes in jasmonate, salicylic acid and ethylene pathways. Moreover, all physiological parameters measured were comparable to control plants. The local Phi concentration detected in roots was high enough to inhibit pathogen growth. Phi treatment alone did not harm seedling physiology or induce defense responses. The up-regulation of defense genes could be explained either by priming or by facilitation of pathogen recognition of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2006804973,"Adenosine is a neuroprotective agent that inhibits neuronal activity and modulates neurotransmission. Previous research has shown adenosine gradually accumulates during pathologies such as stroke and regulates neurotransmission on the minute-to-hour time scale. Our lab developed a method using carbon-fiber microelectrodes to directly measure adenosine changes on a sub-second time scale with fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). Recently, adenosine release lasting a couple of seconds has been found in murine spinal cord slices. In this study, we characterized spontaneous, transient adenosine release in vivo, in the caudate-putamen and prefrontal cortex of anesthetized rats. The average concentration of adenosine release was 0.17±0.01 µM in the caudate and 0.19±0.01 µM in the prefrontal cortex, although the range was large, from 0.04 to 3.2 µM. The average duration of spontaneous adenosine release was 2.9±0.1 seconds and 2.8±0.1 seconds in the caudate and prefrontal cortex, respectively. The concentration and number of transients detected do not change over a four hour period, suggesting spontaneous events are not caused by electrode implantation. The frequency of adenosine transients was higher in the prefrontal cortex than the caudate-putamen and was modulated by A1 receptors. The A1 antagonist DPCPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, 6 mg/kg i.p.) increased the frequency of spontaneous adenosine release, while the A1 agonist CPA (N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine, 1 mg/kg i.p.) decreased the frequency. These findings are a paradigm shift for understanding the time course of adenosine signaling, demonstrating that there is a rapid mode of adenosine signaling that could cause transient, local neuromodulation."
https://openalex.org/W1964165875,"Apoptosis is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that removes damaged or unwanted cells, effectively maintaining cellular homeostasis. It has long been suggested that a deficiency in this type of naturally occurring cell death could potentially lead to necrosis, resulting in the release of endogenous immunogenic molecules such as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and a noninfectious inflammatory response. However, the details about how danger signals from apoptosis-deficient cells are detected and translated to an immune response are largely unknown. In this study, we found that Drosophila mutants deficient for Dronc, the key initiator caspase required for apoptosis, produced the active form of the endogenous Toll ligand Spätzle (Spz). We speculated that, as a system for sensing potential DAMPs in the hemolymph, the dronc mutants constitutively activate a proteolytic cascade that leads to Spz proteolytic processing. We demonstrated that Toll signaling activation required the action of Persephone, a CLIP domain serine protease that usually reacts to microbial proteolytic activities. Our findings show that the Persephone proteolytic cascade plays a crucial role in mediating DAMP-induced systemic responses in apoptosis-deficient Drosophila mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2115389824,"The expected and already observed increment in frequency of extreme climatic events may result in severe vegetation shifts. However, stabilizing mechanisms promoting community resilience can buffer the lasting impact of extreme events. The present work analyzes the resilience of a Mediterranean mountain ecosystem after an extreme drought in 2005, examining shoot-growth and needle-length resistance and resilience of dominant tree and shrub species (Pinus sylvestris vs Juniperus communis, and P. nigra vs J. oxycedrus) in two contrasting altitudinal ranges. Recorded high vegetative-resilience values indicate great tolerance to extreme droughts for the dominant species of pine-juniper woodlands. Observed tolerance could act as a stabilizing mechanism in rear range edges, such as the Mediterranean basin, where extreme events are predicted to be more detrimental and recurrent. However, resistance and resilience components vary across species, sites, and ontogenetic states: adult Pinus showed higher growth resistance than did adult Juniperus; saplings displayed higher recovery rates than did conspecific adults; and P. nigra saplings displayed higher resilience than did P. sylvestris saplings where the two species coexist. P. nigra and J. oxycedrus saplings at high and low elevations, respectively, were the most resilient at all the locations studied. Under recurrent extreme droughts, these species-specific differences in resistance and resilience could promote changes in vegetation structure and composition, even in areas with high tolerance to dry conditions."

Many of the numerous tasks essential for the survival of the colony must be performed at a specific location. Consequently, spatial organization is an integral aspect of division of labor. The mechanisms organizing the spatial distribution of workers, separating inside and outside workers without central control, is an essential, but so far neglected aspect of division of labor. In this study, we investigate the behavioral mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of individual workers and its physiological underpinning in the ant Myrmica rubra. By investigating worker personalities we uncover position-associated behavioral syndromes. This context-independent and temporally stable set of correlated behaviors (positive association between movements and attraction towards light) could promote the basic separation between inside (brood tenders) and outside workers (foragers). These position-associated behavior syndromes are coupled with a high probability to perform tasks, located at the defined position, and a characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon profile. We discuss the potentially physiological causes for the observed behavioral syndromes and highlight how the study of animal personalities can provide new insights for the study of division of labor and self-organized processes in general."
https://openalex.org/W1984556350,"EZH2, a core component of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), plays a role in transcriptional repression through histone H3 Lys-27 trimethylation and is involved in various biological processes, including hematopoiesis. It is well known that 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase that targets the degradation of EZH2, preferentially induces apoptosis in various hematological malignancies, suggesting that EZH2 may be a new target for epigenetic treatment. Because PRC2 participates in epigenetic silencing of a subset of GATA-1 target genes during erythroid differentiation, inhibition of EZH2 may influence erythropoiesis. To explore this possibility, we evaluated the impact of DZNep on erythropoiesis. DZNep treatment significantly induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, as assessed by benzidine staining and quantitative RT-PCR analysis for representative erythroid-related genes, including globins. When we evaluated the effects of DZNep in human primary erythroblasts derived from cord blood CD34-positive cells, the treatment significantly induced erythroid-related genes, as observed in K562 cells, suggesting that DZNep induces erythroid differentiation. Unexpectedly, siRNA-mediated EZH2 knockdown had no significant effect on the expression of erythroid-related genes. Transcriptional profiling of DZNep-treated K562 cells revealed marked up-regulation of SLC4A1 and EPB42, previously reported as representative targets of the transcriptional corepressor ETO2. In addition, DZNep treatment reduced the protein level of ETO2. These data suggest that erythroid differentiation by DZNep may not be directly related to EZH2 inhibition but may be partly associated with reduced protein level of hematopoietic corepressor ETO2. These data provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of DZNep, which may be exploited for therapeutic applications for hematological diseases, including anemia."
https://openalex.org/W2083016961,"Background Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLtps) are small, basic proteins encoded by multigene families and have reported functions in many physiological processes such as mediating phospholipid transfer, defense reactions against phytopathogens, the adaptation of plants to various environmental conditions, and sexual reproduction. To date, no genome-wide overview of the Brassica rapa nsLtp (BrnsLtp) gene family has been performed. Therefore, as the first step and as a helpful strategy to elucidate the functions of BrnsLtps, a genome-wide study for this gene family is necessary. Methodology/Principal Finding In this study, a total of 63 putative BrnsLtp genes were identified through a comprehensive in silico analysis of the whole genome of B. rapa. Based on the sequence similarities, these BrnsLtps was grouped into nine types (I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VIII, IX, and XI). There is no type VII nsLtps in B. rapa, and a new type, XI nsLtps, was identified in B. rapa. Furthermore, nine type II AtLtps have no homologous genes in B. rapa. Gene duplication analysis demonstrated that the conserved collinear block of each BrnsLtp is highly identical to those in Arabidopsis and that both segmental duplications and tandem duplications seem to play equal roles in the diversification of this gene family. Expression analysis indicated that 29 out of the 63 BrnsLtps showed specific expression patterns. After careful comparison and analysis, we hypothesize that some of the type I BrnsLtps may function like Arabidopsis pathogenesis-related-14 (PR-14) proteins to protect the plant from phytopathogen attack. Eleven BrnsLtps with inflorescence-specific expression may play important roles in sexual reproduction. Additionally, BrnsLtpI.3 may have functions similar to Arabidopsis LTP1. Conclusions/Significance The genome-wide identification, bioinformatic analysis and expression analysis of BrnsLtp genes should facilitate research of this gene family and polyploidy evolution and provide new insight towards elucidating their biological functions in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2035954330,"Human TDP-43 represents the main component of neuronal inclusions found in patients with neurodegenerative diseases, especially frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) Drosophila ortholog (TBPH) can biochemically and functionally overlap the properties of the human factor. The recent direct implication of the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2B1 and A1, known TDP-43 partners, in the pathogenesis of multisystem proteinopathy and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis supports the hypothesis that the physical and functional interplay between TDP-43 and hnRNP A/B orthologs might play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. To test this hypothesis and further validate the fly system as a useful model to study this type of diseases, we have now characterized human TDP-43 and Drosophila TBPH similarity in terms of protein-protein interaction pathways. In this work we show that TDP-43 and TBPH share the ability to associate in vitro with Hrp38/Hrb98DE/CG9983, the fruit fly ortholog of the human hnRNP A1/A2 factors. Interestingly, the protein regions of TDP-43 and Hrp38 responsible for reciprocal interactions are conserved through evolution. Functionally, experiments in HeLa cells demonstrate that TDP-43 is necessary for the inhibitory activity of Hrp38 on splicing. Finally, Drosophila in vivo studies show that Hrp38 deficiency produces locomotive defects and life span shortening in TDP-43 with and without animals. These results suggest that hnRNP protein levels can play a modulatory role on TDP-43 functions."
https://openalex.org/W2062127541,"MicroRNAs (miR) are emerging as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in tumor management. Endothelial cell tumors are the most common soft tissue tumors in infants, yet little is known about the significance of miR in regulating their growth. A validated mouse endothelial cell (EOMA) tumor model was used to demonstrate that post-transcriptional gene silencing of dicer, the enzyme that converts pre-miR to mature miR, can prevent tumor formation in vivo. Tumors were formed in eight of eight mice injected with EOMA cells transfected with control shRNA but formed in only four of ten mice injected with EOMA cells transfected with dicer shRNA. Tumors that formed in the dicer shRNA group were significantly smaller than tumors in the control group. This response to dicer knockdown was mediated by up-regulated miR 21a-3p activity targeting the nox-4 3'-UTR. EOMA cells were transfected with miR 21a-3p mimic and luciferase reporter plasmids containing either intact nox-4 3'-UTR or with mutation of the proposed 3'-UTR miR21a-3p binding sites. Mean luciferase activity was decreased by 85% in the intact compared with the site mutated vectors (p < 0.01). Attenuated Nox-4 activity resulted in decreased cellular hydrogen peroxide production and decreased production of oxidant-inducible monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, which we have previously shown to be critically required for endothelial cell tumor formation. These findings provide the first evidence establishing the significance of dicer and microRNA in promoting endothelial cell tumor growth in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2080244885,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis is the principal aetiology of hypothyroidism with presence of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO). The association between anti-TPO and foeto-placental complications has been observed in previous studies. To go further in the understanding, the current study compares the level of anti-TPO in maternal blood and in the cord blood of her fetus at the moment of childbirth to demonstrate the passage of anti-TPO through the placenta barrier.This study was realised in a maternity ward located in the Northern district of Paris, France from 2006 to 2007. Women with normal pregnancy were included in a first study and only women with no abnormal thyroid dosage at baseline and tested positive with anti-TPO were prospectively enrolled. Maternal blood samples were collected in the third trimester and at the arrival to the ward when patients came to deliver. After delivery, cord blood sample was collected. Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed. 5941 patients delivered in the ward during the study, 33 pregnant women were included. We found a correlation between the anti-TPO levels in maternal and in the cord blood of their fetus with a correlation coefficient of 0.98 and a p-value<0.001.This is the first demonstration of the free passage through the placental barrier of anti-TPO from the mother to the fetus at the moment of childbirth. These findings can be extrapolated all along pregnancy and open the door to a direct action of the anti-TPO on fetus and to a possible action on the fetal thyroid."

Fragments of TDP-43, composed of the second RNA recognition motif (RRM2) and the disordered C terminus, have been observed in cytoplasmic inclusions in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases, suggesting that conformational changes involving RRM2 together with the disordered C terminus play a role in aggregation and toxicity. The biophysical data collected by CD and fluorescence spectroscopies reveal a three-state equilibrium unfolding model for RRM2, with a partially folded intermediate state that is not observed in RRM1. Strikingly, a portion of RRM2 beginning at position 208, which mimics a cleavage site observed in patient tissues, increases the population of this intermediate state. Mutually stabilizing interactions between the domains in the tethered RRM1 and RRM2 construct reduce the population of the intermediate state and enhance DNA/RNA binding. Despite the high sequence homology of the two domains, a network of large hydrophobic residues in RRM2 provides a possible explanation for the increased stability of RRM2 compared with RRM1. The cluster analysis suggests that the intermediate state may play a functional role by enhancing access to the nuclear export signal contained within its sequence.

Only 10% of ALS cases have been linked to genetic mutations in numerous genes (familial ALS), whereas the remaining 90% of cases result from an unknown cause (sporadic ALS) (2.Turner M.R. Hardiman O.

The pathological hallmark of ALS is the presence of ubiquitinated inclusions in the cytoplasm of surviving spinal motor neurons. In 2006, biochemical and immunological approaches identified TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as a major protein found in post-mortem brain inclusions of patients with both ALS and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U), providing a molecular connection between these diseases (3.Neumann M.

In the years since this initial discovery, 50 different TDP-43 mutations in familial and sporadic ALS patients have been identified (see the ALS Online Genetics Database), thereby underscoring a direct role for TDP-43 in ALS pathogenesis.

TDP-43 is localized in the nucleus in normal cells but redistributes to form cytoplasmic aggregates composed of hyperphosphorylated and ubiquitinated C-terminal fragments in diseased cells (9.Igaz L.M.

As inferred from studies of other protein aggregates involved in neurodegenerative diseases (10.Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease.Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S10-S17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2453) Google Scholar), TDP-43 aggregates may arise from the population of non-native conformations that probably drive the neurodegeneration directly through a gain-of-function or loss-of-function mechanism. In these scenarios, the formation and accumulation of TDP-43 aggregates generate toxicity or impair normal TDP-43 cellular function, resulting in cell death. Mounting evidence supports a loss-of-function phenotype (11.Xu Z.-S. Does a loss of TDP-43 function cause neurodegeneration?.Mol. Neurodegener. 2012; 7: 27Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), where sequestration of functional protein into cytoplasmic aggregates would limit the pool of available functional nuclear TDP-43. Several studies have demonstrated that both RRM2 and the disordered C terminus are required for aggregation and toxicity (12.Johnson B.S. McCaffery J.M. Lindquist S. Gitler A.D.

Examination of the domain architecture of TDP-43 suggests a possible interplay between structured and disordered sequences that may play a key role in toggling between appropriate biological function and dysfunction leading to disease (Fig. 1A). Computer algorithms developed for predicting aggregation prone regions in unfolded polypeptide chains (16.Fernandez-Escamilla A.M. Rousseau F. Schymkowitz J. Serrano L.

The two RRM domains share significant sequence (Fig. 1B) and structural (Fig. 1, C and D) homology. The NMR solution structures of the isolated RRM domains (Fig. 1, C and D) and the tethered RRM domains (Fig. 1E) show an α + β structure for each domain, composed of two repeating βαβ motifs with an extra β-strand (β4) inserted within the second βαβ motif. Together, these strands form an antiparallel β-sheet across one face of the RRM with the α-helices docked on the opposite face. Although RRM domains can bind a diverse set of targets, including RNA, DNA, and peptides and other proteins (19.Cléry A. Blatter M. Allain F.H. RNA recognition motifs. Boring? Not quite.Curr. Opin.

Baralle F.E. Characterization and functional implications of the RNA binding properties of nuclear factor TDP-43, a novel splicing regulator of CFTR exon 9.J. Biol.

To understand how the conformations populated by the RRM domains of TDP-43 may play a role in disease propagation, the equilibrium unfolding and RNA-binding properties of the isolated and tethered RRM domains were probed by a pair of complementary spectroscopic techniques. The results identified a novel intermediate state in the folding of the RRM2 domain. The population of this intermediate is increased in a cleavage fragment but is reduced upon tethering to RRM1. The intermediate state in RRM2 may serve as a molecular hazard that may partition between productive folding and function on the one hand and misfolding and aberrant protein-protein interactions that could lead to disease progression on the other.

The genes were inserted into a modified pGEX-6p1 (GE Healthcare) or pET-3d (Novagen) vector with a His6 tag and either a PreScission or TEV protease cleavage site, respectively, for His6 tag removal. The proteins were overexpressed in BL21 DE3 Escherichia coli cells (Stratagene) grown in LB medium until A600 = 0.8, followed by induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 24 h at 20 °C (RRM1 and tRRMs) or for 16 h at 30 °C (RRM2 and RRM2c). Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm NaPi, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 30 mm imidazole) and lysed by sonication. RRM2 and RRM2c were only present in the insoluble fraction, and isolation from cell pellets was performed in the presence of 6 m urea. Each construct was bound to His60 resin (Clontech) overnight and washed with 10 column volumes of lysis buffer before elution with 300 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against protease cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT), followed by subsequent cleavage with PreScission or TEV protease to remove the His6 tag. Minor contaminants were removed through ion exchange chromatography using S Sepharose (RRM1) or Q Sepharose (RRM2, tRRMs, and RRM2c) before dialysis into 10 mm KPi, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol for subsequent studies. After cleavage, protein purity was >98%, as determined by both SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy carried out at the Proteomics and Mass Spectrometry Facility, University of Massachusetts Medical School. RRM2 contains a second TEV protease-like cleavage site (246EDLIIKG252), as determined by mass spectrometry, preventing isolation of the intact domain. Thus, all RRM2-containing constructs were expressed instead with a PreScission protease site after the N-terminal His tag. Cleavage with TEV protease (24.Lucast L.J. Batey R.T. Doudna J.A. Large-scale purification of a stable form of recombinant tobacco etch virus protease.BioTechniques. 2001; 30 (548, 550 passim): 544-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) results in an N-terminal Gly residue before the RRM amino acid sequence, and cleavage with PreScission protease leaves an N-terminal GPLGS sequence, with the LGS sequence being required for cloning. Size exclusion chromatography was performed on all constructs using a 24-ml Superdex 200 10/300 GL column run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml min−1. Oligomerization status of the constructs was monitored as a function of loaded protein concentration by comparison with protein molecular weight standards (GE Healthcare). All size exclusion chromatography was performed at 4 °C in 10 mm KPi, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The native state circular dichroism (CD) spectrum of each construct was collected from 190 to 280 nm on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter with a thermoelectric temperature control system in a 0.1-cm cuvette (Hellma). Guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced denaturation spectra were collected from 260 to 215 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm min−1 and a response time of 8 s. Samples were prepared from native and unfolded stock solutions mixed in precise amounts by in-house software and a Hamilton series 500 titrator. The resulting solutions were incubated overnight at room temperature or at 37 °C before recording CD spectra. All GdnHCl concentrations were measured using an ABBE refractometer, and all CD measurements were baseline-corrected for buffer contributions. Protein concentration was measured by A280 absorbance (25.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Calculation of protein extinction coefficients from amino acid sequence data.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar), using an extinction coefficient of 15,470 m−1 cm−1 for tRRMs, 13,980 m−1 cm−1 for RRM1, and 1490 m−1 cm−1 for RRM2 and RRM2c. The protein concentration was varied from 5 to 60 μm for CD experiments. Each CD spectra was normalized for protein concentration and number of amino acids and reported as mean residue ellipticity (26.Greenfield N.J. Using circular dichroism spectra to estimate protein secondary structure.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2876-2890Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). Reversibility was confirmed to be >95% by the coincidence of equilibrium profiles for samples prepared from initial protein stocks in either buffer or denaturant. Steady-state fluorescence (FL) measurements were performed on a Spex Fluorolog-3 equipped with a wavelength electronics temperature controller. For RRM2 and RRM2c, each GdnHCl titration sample was excited at 274 nm, and tyrosine emission spectra were collected from 280 to 400 nm at 20 or 37 °C with 5-nm slit widths. For the tryptophan-containing RRM1 and tRRMs proteins, excitation was at 295 nm, and tryptophan emission spectra were collected from 300 to 500 nm at 20 °C with 5-nm slit widths. Denaturation experiments by both CD and FL were performed in replicates of three for each construct to ensure reproducibility. The equilibrium folding data for each construct were analyzed using an appropriate equilibrium folding model with the in-house data analysis software Savuka (27.Bilsel O. Zitzewitz J.A. Bowers K.E.

Each data set was subjected to a global analysis, where the baselines were local parameters, and the free energy of folding in the absence of denaturant (ΔG0H2O) and the m value were globally linked between data sets. All of the Trp and Tyr fluorescence equilibrium profiles as well as the CD equilibrium profile for RRM1 were best fit to a two-state model, N ⇆ U. For these experiments, the change in free energy between the native and unfolded states is assumed to depend linearly on the denaturant concentration as shown in Equation 1 (28.Pace C.N. Determination and analysis of urea and guanidine hydrochloride denaturation curves.Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2416) Google Scholar). ΔG=ΔGH2O0-m[D](Eq. 1) The change in free energy in the absence of denaturant, ΔG0H2O, can be used to determine the equilibrium constant, Keq, from Equation 2. Keq=exp(-ΔGH2O0-m[D]RT)(Eq. 2) For the CD equilibrium unfolding profiles of RRM2 and RRM2c, a three-state model best described the transition between the native and unfolded forms of the protein with the population of a stable intermediate state (I), N ⇆ I ⇆ U. Tethering the two RRM domains by the natural 15-amino acid residue linker sequence (tRRMs) results in the population of multiple stable intermediates at equilibrium by CD. In this case, the data were best fit with a four-state equilibrium model, N ⇆ I1 ⇆ I2 ⇆ U, with the population of two stable intermediate states, I1 and I2. The fractional population of the intermediate state for RRM2 and RRM2c at a given denaturant concentration was determined from the partition function according to Equation 3 (29.Finn B.E. Chen X.

The I2 intermediate in the four-state model for tRRMs corresponds to the single intermediate for RRM2, and its fractional population was calculated as defined in Equation 4, Fl2=exp(-ΔGNI2RT)1+exp(-ΔGNI1RT)+exp(-ΔGNI2RT)+exp(-ΔGNURT)(Eq. 4) where ΔGNI1 = ΔG0NI1 − mNI1[D], ΔGNI2 = ΔG0NI2 − mNI2[D], and ΔGNU = ΔG0NU − mNU[D]. EMSAs and tryptophan (Trp) lifetimes were used to determine the apparent binding affinity of the TDP-43 RRM domains to UGUGUGUGUGUG ((UG)6), TGTGTGTGTGTG ((TG)6), and TTTTTTTTTTTT (T12) 12-mer oligonucleotides (IDT Technologies). For EMSA, the oligonucleotides were fluorescently labeled at the 5′-end by 5-carboxyfluorescein (IDT Technologies). A typical EMSA consists of 50-μl reactions of 3 nm nucleotides incubated with increasing protein concentrations up to 8 μm. Binding reactions were performed in binding buffer, 10 mm KPi, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 10 μg ml−1 tRNA, and 0.01% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma-Aldrich) (30.Pagano J.M. Farley B.M. McCoig L.M.

Prior to loading on an 8% polyacrylamide gel, 5 μl of bromocresol blue in 30% glycerol was added to each reaction, and 45 μl of the reaction mixture was added to the acrylamide gel. The samples were run for 1 h at 140 V in 1× Tris-boric acid buffer followed by subsequent imaging with a Fujifilm FLA-5000 system using a 473-nm excitation wavelength. The fraction of bound DNA or RNA, θ, was measured using Multi Gauge software (Fujifilm) to quantify the bound fractions (upper bands) and free DNA fractions (lower bands) from the polyacrylamide gel. θ=Bound DNABound DNA+Free DNA(Eq. 5) Trp lifetime assays were performed in 500-μl reactions consisting of 2 μm protein incubated with increasing amounts of nucleic acid in the EMSA binding buffer described above. The samples were excited at 295 nm in a 50-μl cuvette (Hellma) using an autosampler configuration to prevent Trp photobleaching. The laser intensity was adjusted using 4 μm N-acetyl-tryptophanamide as a standard to ensure a count rate between 8 × 104 and 1 × 105 per second prior to sample acquisition. Trp lifetime decays were measured for 2 min in 30-s intervals for each sample with ∼60,000 counts total in the peak channel. The Trp lifetime decays were corrected for buffer contributions and subsequently fit to two exponential decays, which differed slightly, depending on protein construct and DNA/RNA. In comparison with samples containing only protein, the amplitudes of the ∼3.8 and ∼5.8 ns components decreased and increased, respectively, with increased DNA/RNA concentration. Thus, the amplitude of the faster phase represented the unbound protein, and the slower phase resulted from the DNA/RNA-bound protein. θ=Amplitude ∼3.8nsAmplitued ∼3.8ns+Amplitued ∼5.8ns(Eq. 6) The percentage bound was determined as a function of DNA/RNA concentration and modeled to the quadratic binding equation (Equation 7) using Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, Inc.) to determine the apparent dissociation constant, Kd,app, (31.Pagano J.M.

Each isolated RRM domain (RRM1 and RRM2) could be expressed at high levels, was soluble to concentrations exceeding 5 mg ml−1 (∼0.5 mm), and was monomeric by size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Despite their structural similarity by NMR (Fig. 1, C and D), the CD spectra of the two isolated RRM domains were strikingly different from one another. Indeed, CD spectra can vary widely between RRM domains, including RNA-binding proteins that contain a single RRM domain, such as FUS/TLS (32.Iko Y. Kodama T.S. Kasai N. Oyama T. Morita E.H. Muto T.

RRM1 contains a dramatically increased CD signal compared with RRM2 (Fig. 2B), consistent in part with the enhanced α-helical structure content of RRM1 (25%) compared with RRM2 (20%), as predicted by DSSP (35.Kabsch W.

The CD spectrum of RRM2 was approximately half as intense as that of RRM1, with a minimum at 210 nm and a shoulder at 230 nm. Although the two RRM domains have identical β-strand content (30%), the NMR structures indicate that RRM1 has more twist to its β-sheet compared with RRM2, consistent also with the increased intensity of the CD signal for RRM1 (37.Berova N.

We used a model of enteral nutrient deprivation, or total parenteral nutrition (TPN), resulting in intestinal mucosal atrophy and decreased epithelial barrier function (EBF). We examined how a single amino acid, glutamate (GLM), modulates intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) growth and EBF. Controls were chow-fed mice, T1 receptor-3 (T1R3)-knockout (KO) mice, and treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-5 antagonist MTEP. TPN significantly changed the amount of T1Rs, GLM receptors, and transporters, and GLM prevented these changes. GLM significantly prevented TPN-associated intestinal atrophy (2.5-fold increase in IEC proliferation) and was dependent on up-regulation of the protein kinase pAkt, but independent of T1R3 and mGluR5 signaling. GLM led to a loss of EBF with TPN (60% increase in FITC-dextran permeability, 40% decline in transepithelial resistance); via T1R3, it protected EBF, whereas mGluR5 was associated with EBF loss. GLM led to a decline in circulating glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) during TPN. The decline was regulated by T1R3 and mGluR5, suggesting a novel negative regulator pathway for IEC proliferation not previously described. Loss of luminal nutrients with TPN administration may widely affect intestinal taste sensing. GLM has previously unrecognized actions on IEC growth and EBF. Restoring luminal sensing via GLM could be a strategy for patients on TPN.—Xiao, W., Feng, Y., Holst, J. J., Hartmann, B., Yang, H., Teitelbaum, D. H.

Human DNA methylomes at base resolution show widespread epigenomic differences.Nature. 2009; 462: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, there are three catalytically active DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase families represented by DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B along with a methyltransferase-like protein, DNMT3L, which lacks a catalytic domain (5.Chen T. Li E. Establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns in mammals.in: Doerfler W. Böhm P. DNA Methylation: Basic Mechanisms. Springer, Berlin2006: 179-201Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The physical interaction and functional partnership between de novo methyltransferase DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and DNMT3L is well documented and is hypothesized to bind and methylate chromatin as a substrate (6.Ooi S.K.

Hypomethylation of the genome leads to chromosome instability, and aberrant DNA methylation is frequently observed in cancer (8.Ehrlich M.

Genetic disruption of cytosine DNA methyltransferase enzymes induces chromosomal instability in human cancer cells.Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8635-8639Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Among the DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 is known as the maintenance methyltransferase. DNMT1 preserves epigenetic inheritance by methylating the newly synthesized daughter strand during DNA replication (10.Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei.Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). There are several interacting proteins of DNMT1, most notably PCNA and UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) (11.Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F.

Pradhan S. Jacobsen S.E. UHRF1 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells.Science. 2007; 317: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). Both PCNA and UHRF1 are colocalized with DNMT1 during DNA replication, and deletion of UHRF1 by genetic knockout resulted in a severe loss (>80%) of 5mC in the embryonic stem cells. This suggests that there are proteins other than DNA methyltransferases that play an important role in the mechanism of epigenetic inheritance, perhaps via selective targeting of enzymes. Furthermore, UHRF1 has E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity that mediates the ubiquitination of target proteins, such as histone H3 and promyelocytic leukemia protein and alters gene expression (13.Guan D. Factor D. Liu Y. Wang Z. Kao H.Y.

Another mechanism that influences epigenetic inheritance is the availability and stability of DNA methyltransferases in cells. Some mechanistic based inhibitors of DNMTs, such as 5-azacytidine, are a chemical analog of the cytosine nucleoside of DNA and RNA (15.Li L.H. Olin E.J. Buskirk H.H. Reineke L.M. Cytotoxicity and mode of action of 5-azacytidine on L1210 leukemia.Cancer Res. 1970; 30: 2760-2769PubMed Google Scholar). 5-Azacytidine is thought to inhibit DNA methyltransferases at low doses, causing hypomethylation of DNA (16.Stresemann C. Brueckner B. Musch T. Stopper H. Lyko F. Functional diversity of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in human cancer cell lines.Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 2794-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Incorporation of 5-azacytidine into DNA leads to its covalent binding and capturing of DNA methyltransferases, resulting in the depletion of the enzyme pool in the cell (17.Santi D.V. Norment A. Garrett C.E. Covalent bond formation between a DNA-cytosine methyltransferase and DNA containing 5-azacytosine.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 6993-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 18.Jüttermann R. Li E. Jaenisch R. Toxicity of 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine to mammalian cells is mediated primarily by covalent trapping of DNA methyltransferase rather than DNA demethylation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 11797-11801Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In another study, 5-azacytidine and 5-aza-CdR treatment of cultured mammalian cells led to rapid degradation of DNMTs by the cellular proteasomal pathway (19.Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Jacob S.T. 5-Aza-deoxycytidine induces selective degradation of DNA methyltransferase 1 by a proteasomal pathway that requires the KEN box, bromo-adjacent homology domain, and nuclear localization signal.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4727-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is plausible that both covalent attachment of these enzymes to DNA and their degradation may lead to poor maintenance of DNA methylation, consequently leading to hypomethylation of the genome and cellular apoptosis. There are several studies supporting the role of lysine methylation of non-histone proteins in the regulation of protein activity and stability, particularly p53, ERα, RelA, and DNMT1 (20.Yang X.D. Lamb A. Chen L.F. Methylation, a new epigenetic mark for protein stability.Epigenetics. 2009; 4: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both p53 and ERα are stabilized by lysine methylation, whereas RelA and DNMT1 are destabilized. The effect of lysine methylation on histones is well studied, and it can be repressive or activating, depending on what lysine is methylated in a chromatin context (21.Black J.C. Van Rechem C. Whetstine J.R. Histone lysine methylation dynamics. Establishment, regulation, and biological impact.Mol. Cell. 2012; 48: 491-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Indeed, distinct methyllysine marks recruit different reader proteins, resulting in different transcriptional responses. For example, histone H3K9me recruits HP1 proteins for gene silencing (22.Lachner M. O'Carroll D. Rea S. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 creates a binding site for HP1 proteins.Nature. 2001; 410: 116-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar). Several protein domains are capable of recognizing methylation marks, including ANK repeats, WD40, plant homeodomain, PWWP, chromodomain, and MBT domain (23.Wysocka J. Swigut T. Milne T.A. Dou Y.

Proteins containing MBT domains are products of polycomb group genes and have been implicated in transcriptional repression of developmental genes. Indeed, misregulation of MBT-containing proteins has been linked to various disease phenotypes (26.Bonasio R. Lecona E. Reinberg D. MBT domain proteins in development and disease.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2010; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we demonstrated that SET7 monomethylation of DNMT1 (DNMT1K142me1) leads to its proteasome-mediated protein degradation, and we have hypothesized that the antagonist LSD1 (lysine-specific demethylase 1) may prevent this degradation by removing the methyl mark (27.Estève P.O. Chin H.G. Benner J. Feehery G.R. Samaranayake M. Horwitz G.A. Jacobsen S.E. Pradhan S. Regulation of DNMT1 stability through SET7-mediated lysine methylation in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5076-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Furthermore, DNMT1K142me1 acts as an antagonist to Ser-143 phosphorylation, thus offering a methyl-phospho switch status that operates during the cell cycle. Phosphorylated DNMT1 is more stable than the methylated enzyme, and it is more abundant during the DNA synthesis stage of the cell cycle (28.Estève P.O. Chang Y. Samaranayake M. Upadhyay A.K. Horton J.R. Feehery G.R. Cheng X. Pradhan S. A methylation and phosphorylation switch between an adjacent lysine and serine determines human DNMT1 stability.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Although the methylated species of DNMT1 accumulates during the late DNA synthesis stage and decreases thereafter, a significant percentage still remains throughout the whole cell cycle. This prompted us to search for a possible reader(s) of lysine-methylated DNMT1 and its role in the cell. In this report, we discuss a novel DNMT1K142me1 reader, PHF20L1, a protein that contains an active MBT domain (24.Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T.

We studied its role in DNMT1 stability, loading, and epigenetic inheritance in mammalian cells. All cell lines (HeLa, COS-7, Jurkat, HCT116, and HEK293) were grown as per ATCC recommendations. Nuclear cell extracts were immunoprecipitated as described previously (29.Andrews N.C. Faller D.V.

A methylation and phosphorylation switch between an adjacent lysine and serine determines human DNMT1 stability.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2011; 18: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). UNC1215 and proteasome inhibitor MG132 were purchased from Tocris Bioscience and Selleck Chemicals, respectively. UNC1215 and MG132 were dissolved in ethanol and methanol, respectively. For cell cycle analysis, HeLa cells were synchronized in G1/S by using 2 mm thymidine block followed by 5 μg/ml aphidicolin treatment. Chromatin was extracted as described previously (12.Bostick M. Kim J.K. Estève P.O. Clark A. Pradhan S. Jacobsen S.E. UHRF1 plays a role in maintaining DNA methylation in mammalian cells.Science. 2007; 317: 1760-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). For DNMT1 protein stability and degradation studies, either cycloheximide or MG132 was applied. For the cycloheximide study, HeLa cells were treated with 60 μm UNC1215 for 2 days and then incubated with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma-Aldrich) at different times. For the MG132 study, HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations (0, 20, 40, and 80 μm) of UNC1215 for 2 days and then incubated with 50 μm MG132 for 2 h. Cells were then lysed and assayed by Western blot using a DNMT1 antibody (New England Biolabs, catalog no. M0231S). Immunoprecipitations of nuclear cell extracts (400 μg to 1 mg) were performed by using 5 μg of anti-DNMT1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab92453) or anti-PHF20L1 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. HPA028417). 5 μg of purified normal rabbit IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 2729) was used as a negative control. Immunoprecipitations were loaded into SDS-polyacrylamide gels for subsequent Western blot analyses. For immunoprecipitation studies done after UNC1215 treatment, HeLa cells were treated with 80 μm UNC1215 or ethanol for 3 days prior to precipitation. GST pull-downs were performed with increasing amounts (1, 2, and 4 μg) of baculovirus purified full-length DNMT1 (New England Biolabs, catalog no. M0230S) that were methylated overnight by MBP-SET7 (New England Biolabs, catalog no. M0233S) and then incubated with purified MBT-GST (10 μg). DNMT1 was cloned into pVIC1 (New England Biolabs) and purified as described previously (32.Pradhan S. Bacolla A. Wells R.D. Roberts R.J. Recombinant human DNA (cytosine-5) methyltransferase. I. Expression, purification, and comparison of de novo and maintenance methylation.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33002-33010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). MBP-SET7 and MBP-PHF20L1 were cloned into pMAL-C5x vector (New England Biolabs, catalog no. N8108S) and purified using amylose resin (New England Biolabs, catalog no. E8021). In vitro pull-downs of MBP-PHF20L1a with DNMT1K142me1 peptide were carried out by first incubating 10 μm peptide (biotin-LSKPRTPRRSK(me1)SDGEAKPE) with agarose-streptavidin beads (25 μl of bead slurry, Thermo Scientific, catalog no. 2359) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation in peptide binding buffer containing 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, and 100 mm KCl. The beads were then washed two times with 1× PBS and resuspended in fresh binding buffer. 500 ng of recombinant MBP-PHF20L1a, with increasing concentrations of UNC1215 inhibitor (0, 20, 40, 100, and 200 μm) was then added simultaneously to the peptide-bound streptavidin beads and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were then washed two times with binding buffer and resuspended in 3× SDS sample buffer containing 1 mm DTT (New England Biolabs, catalog no. B7709S). Samples were then boiled at 95 °C for 5 min and analyzed by Western blot analysis (detailed under “Western Blot and Densitometry”) with anti-MBP-HRP antibodies at a 1:5000 dilution (New England Biolabs, catalog no. E8038S). For immunofluorescence studies, COS-7 cells were cultured on coverslips and transfected with a mixture of epitope-tagged PHF20L1a, CFP-SET7 plasmids, and Transpass D2 transfection reagent (New England Biolabs) at a ratio of 1:3 μg/μl for 24 h. The cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (v/v). Serum detecting endogenous DNMT1K142me1 protein (New England Biolabs) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution and visualized with an anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 594 dye (Molecular Probes). Epitope-tagged PHF20L1a protein was detected by an anti-mouse FLAG (or anti-mouse Myc from Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 2276) and visualized with an anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 dye (Molecular Probes). These probes were visualized under a Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope with a 63× oil objective lens or under a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. CFP-SET7 was visualized using confocal microscopy (405-nm laser) or with an AQUA filter using an Axiovert microscope. In some cases, DAPI nuclear staining was used. For 5mC detection, fixed cells were first incubated with 2 n HCl for 20 min and neutralized with 1 m Tris base for 5 min at room temperature. A mouse monoclonal antibody specific for 5mC (Eurogentec, catalog no. BI-MECY-0100) was added at 1:500 dilution overnight at 4 °C and detected by an anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 dye. Endogenous PHF20L1 and DNMT1 proteins in HeLa cells were detected using an anti-PHF20L1 antibody (Abcam, catalog no. ab67796) at 1:20 dilution and an anti-DNMT1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., catalog no. sc-20701) at 1:50 dilution. To visualize endogenous colocalization of PHF20L1 and DNMT1, secondary anti-mouse IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 594 dye and anti-rabbit IgG coupled with Alexa Fluor 488 dye antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used, respectively. For the far-Western experiment, samples containing recombinant DNMT1 (10 μg) were first incubated with either recombinant MBP2-SET7 (40 μg) or MBP2 (20 μg). Increasing amounts of these DNMT1 mixtures (0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg) were then electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The PVDF membrane was blocked in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v), and 5% dry milk (w/v) for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times for 5 min in 1× PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v). Peptide binding buffer containing 2 μg of recombinant MBP-PHF20L1a was added to the membrane and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was then washed three times for 5 min in 1× PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 (v/v). Rabbit anti-PHF20L1 (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. HPA028417) antibody was used (1:2000 dilution) to detect the PHF20L1a bound to the membrane-immobilized DNMT1. For PHF20L1 gene knockdown, HeLa cells were transfected for 48 h using HiPerFect reagent (Qiagen, catalog no. 301705) with 100 nm PHF20L1 siRNA (catalog no. EHU060221, Sigma-Aldrich) or SMART pool ON-TARGETplus PHF20L1 siRNA (catalog no. L-027322-01-0005, Thermo Scientific). For control transfection, 100 nm EGFP siRNA (catalog no. EHUEGFP, Sigma-Aldrich) or a universal negative control siRNA were used (catalog no. 12935-300, Invitrogen). The siRNA control used for SMART pool PHF20L1 was an ON-TARGETplus non-targeting control pool (catalog no. D-001810-10-05, Thermo Scientific). For global 5mC detection by HPLC, cells were transfected for 5 days using 50 nm PHF20L1 siRNA. Briefly, 107 HeLa cells were collected, washed three times with PBS, and resuspended in buffer A containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.34 m sucrose, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1 mm DTT, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and PMSF. After a 5-min incubation on ice, cells were centrifuged (1300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the pellet P1 corresponding to the nuclei was collected, the supernatant S1 representing the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei were lysed for 10 min on ice with a hypotonic buffer B containing 0.2 mm EGTA, 3 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture plus PMSF. The soluble nuclear fraction S3 and the chromatin P3 were separated through centrifugation (1700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The P3 fraction was resuspended in buffer C, containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitor mixture plus PMSF. The chromatin P3 fraction was kept at −80 °C. Before loading 20 μg of chromatin on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, the P3 fraction was first treated with DNase I (New England Biolabs, catalog no. M0303S) for 10 min at 37 °C and then resuspended and boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (New England Biolabs) containing 1 mm DTT. Gel filtration chromatography was performed with Jurkat cell nuclear extract as described previously (30.Estève P.O. Chin H.G. Smallwood A. Feehery G.R. Gangisetty O. Karpf A.R. Carey M.F. Pradhan S. Direct interaction between DNMT1 and G9a coordinates DNA and histone methylation during replication.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3089-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells were co-transfected with a mixture of GFP or GFP-SET7, 3xFLAG or 3xFLAG-PHF20L1, HA-ubiquitin as well as DsRed-DNMT1 plasmids, and Transpass D2 transfection reagent (New England Biolabs) at a ratio of 1:3 μg/μl for 24 h. Transfected COS-7 cells were treated with 10 μm MG132 for 12 h and lysed as described previously (27.Estève P.O. Chin H.G. Benner J. Feehery G.R. Samaranayake M. Horwitz G.A. Jacobsen S.E. Pradhan S. Regulation of DNMT1 stability through SET7-mediated lysine methylation in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5076-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Cell lysates (100–200 μg) were then immunoprecipitated with DNMT1 antibody (Abcam, catalog no. ab92453). Ubiquitination was detected as described previously (27.Estève P.O. Chin H.G. Benner J. Feehery G.R. Samaranayake M. Horwitz G.A. Jacobsen S.E. Pradhan S. Regulation of DNMT1 stability through SET7-mediated lysine methylation in mammalian cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 5076-5081Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as previously described (30.Estève P.O. Chin H.G. Smallwood A. Feehery G.R. Gangisetty O. Karpf A.R. Carey M.F. Pradhan S. Direct interaction between DNMT1 and G9a coordinates DNA and histone methylation during replication.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3089-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Antibodies and antiserum against DNMT1 were obtained from New England Biolabs (1:10,000 working dilution). Anti-PHF20L1 antibody (1:5000 working dilution) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (catalog no. HPA028417). Anti-SET7 (catalog no. 2813), anti-histone H3 (catalog no. 9715), anti-PHF20 (catalog no. 3934), and anti-HA tag (catalog no. 3724) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used at a 1:2000 dilution. Anti-β-actin and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and Roche Applied Science, respectively, and used at a 1:5000 dilution. Densitometry was performed using ImageJ software (W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health). All densitometry values (arbitrary units) were normalized to either their respective β-actin, histone H3 blots, or Ponceau S staining. siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were harvested, and total RNA was purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). For reverse transcription of RNA, iScript (Bio-Rad) was used to convert 1 μg of total RNA, and then 40 ng of cDNA was quantified by performing real-time PCR using a MyiQ Cycler (Bio-Rad) and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The following primers were used in the real-time mixes at a working concentration of 5 nm each: DNMT1, GGCTGAGATGAGGCAAAAAG (forward) and ACCAACTCGGTACAGGATGC (reverse); PHF20L1, AGCGTTGGAACCATCGTTAT (forward) and GACAATCAGACCAGCAAGCA (reverse). RNA values were normalized using primers GCCAAAAGGGTCATCATCTC (forward) and TGAGTCCTTCCACGATACCA (reverse) for human GAPDH. Genomic DNA was isolated from siRNA-transfected HeLa cells using an Invitrogen Easy-DNA kit (catalog no. K1800-01) per the manufacturer's specifications. RNA contamination was removed from the genomic DNA with AMPure XP (Agencourt, catalog no. A63880) beads per the manufacturer's specifications. Nucleoside digestion of genomic DNA was done by incubating 4–5 μg of genomic DNA in a mixture of New England Biolabs nucleases at 37 °C overnight. Nucleosides were subsequently purified by running the digested sample through a Qiagen QIAquick spin column and collecting the flow-through. LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system equipped with a G1316A UV detector and 6120 mass detector (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) with a Waters Atlantis T3 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 3 μm, Waters (Milford, MA)) equipped with an in-line filter and guard column. Peak quantification was based on the integration area of each target nucleoside at the maximum absorption of UV and adjusted by its respective extinction coefficient constant. Biotin or biotin-DNMT1K142me1 peptides were bound and detected on a chromatin-associated domain array (CADOR) as described previously (24.Kim J. Daniel J. Espejo A. Lake A. Krishna M. Xia L. Zhang Y. Bedford M.T. Tudor, MBT and chromo domains gauge the degree of lysine methylation.EMBO Rep. 2006; 7: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The CADOR chip contains bromodomain, chromodomain, and Tudor, PHD, SANT, SWIRM, MBT, CW, and PWWP domains fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). To search for a reader of DNMT1K142me1 modification, we synthesized a biotin-tagged peptide encompassing amino acids 132–150 of DNMT1 with monomethylated Lys-142 in the center and screened with a protein domain microarray (24.Kim J.

Thus, pathways for catabolism of this intermediate have evolved in all kingdoms of life, preventing the accumulation of toxic propionyl-CoA concentrations. Previous studies have shown that fungi generally use the methyl citrate cycle for propionyl-CoA degradation. Here, we show that this is not the case for the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans despite its ability to use propionate and valerate as carbon sources. Comparative proteome analyses suggested the presence of a modified β-oxidation pathway with the key intermediate 3-hydroxypropionate. Gene deletion analyses confirmed that the enoyl-CoA hydratase/dehydrogenase Fox2p, the putative 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA hydrolase Ehd3p, the 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase Hpd1p, and the putative malonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase Ald6p essentially contribute to propionyl-CoA degradation and its conversion to acetyl-CoA. The function of Hpd1p was further supported by the detection of accumulating 3-hydroxypropionate in the hpd1 mutant on propionyl-CoA-generating nutrients. Substrate specificity of Hpd1p was determined from recombinant purified enzyme, which revealed a preference for 3-hydroxypropionate, although serine and 3-hydroxyisobutyrate could also serve as substrates. Finally, virulence studies in a murine sepsis model revealed attenuated virulence of the hpd1 mutant, which indicates generation of propionyl-CoA from host-provided nutrients during infection.

Finally, virulence studies in a murine sepsis model revealed attenuated virulence of the hpd1 mutant, which indicates generation of propionyl-CoA from host-provided nutrients during infection. Candida albicans is an important opportunistic pathogen of humans (1.Kim J. Sudbery P. Candida albicans, a major human fungal pathogen.J. Microbiol. 2011; 49: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), which is frequently found on mucosal surfaces such as the oral cavity, vaginal mucosa, or the digestive tract (2.Gow N.A. Hube B. Importance of the Candida albicans cell wall during commensalism and infection.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2012; 15: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Depending on the health status of its host, it can turn from a harmless commensal into a pathogen causing invasive mucosal or even life-threatening systemic infections. Epidemiologic studies have revealed that C. albicans is responsible for up to 15% of nosocomial bloodstream infections (3.Moran C. Grussemeyer C.A. Spalding J.R. Benjamin Jr., D.K. Reed S.D. Candida albicans and non-albicans bloodstream infections in adult and pediatric patients: comparison of mortality and costs.Pediatr. Infect Dis. J. 2009; 28: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Of note, nosocomial candidemia is connected with high mortality rates of about 40% (3.Moran C. Grussemeyer C.A. Spalding J.R. Benjamin Jr., D.K. Reed S.D. Candida albicans and non-albicans bloodstream infections in adult and pediatric patients: comparison of mortality and costs.Pediatr. Infect Dis. J. 2009; 28: 433-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The ability to thrive in various host niches is the basis for the establishment of infections (4.Brock M.

Nutrient acquisition by pathogenic fungi: nutrient availability, pathway regulation, and differences in substrate utilization.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2011; 301: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A prominent example is the metabolic switch from fermentative to nonfermentative growth upon phagocytosis by granulocytes (6.Rubin-Bejerano I. Fraser I. Grisafi P. Fink G.R. Phagocytosis by neutrophils induces an amino acid deprivation response in Saccharomyces cerevisiaeCandida albicans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Niche-specific regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although the bloodstream provides glucose as a preferred carbon source for the pathogen as indicated by increased expression of glycolytic genes (PFK2 and PYK1) (9.Barelle C.J. Priest C.L. Maccallum D.M. Gow N.A. Odds F.C. Brown A.J. Niche-specific regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), C. albicans is subjected to glucose starvation after phagocytosis (7.Lorenz M.C. Bender J.A. Fink G.R.

Microbiol. 2006; 8: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To escape the hostile environment of phagocytes, the cells undergo a morphogenetic switch from yeast to hyphae (10.Shareck J. Belhumeur P. Modulation of morphogenesis in Candida albicans by various small molecules.Eukaryot. Cell. 2011; 10: 1004-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and invade the surrounding tissues. For this process, it has been shown that mutations in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the glyoxylate cycle decrease virulence (9.Barelle C.J. Priest C.L. Maccallum D.M. Gow N.A. Odds F.C. Brown A.J. Niche-specific regulation of central metabolic pathways in a fungal pathogen.Cell. Microbiol. 2006; 8: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 11.Lorenz M.C. Fink G.R.

Life and death in a macrophage: role of the glyoxylate cycle in virulence.Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), indicating that the adaptation to the available nutrient sources is critical for a successful infection process. Besides glucose, host-derived fatty acids, lipids, and proteins likely serve as additional nutrients for C. albicans. However, previous studies have shown that metabolism of fatty acids via β-oxidation seems dispensable for virulence (13.Piekarska K. Mol E. van den Berg M. Hardy G. van den Burg J. van Roermund C. MacCallum D. Odds F. Distel B. Peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation is not essential for virulence of Candida albicans.Eukaryot.

Phylogenetic and phenotypic characterisation of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase gene family from the opportunistic human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans.FEMS Yeast Res. 2013; 13: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although a fox2 mutant, which is unable to utilize fatty acids as nutrient sources, revealed attenuated virulence, this effect was mainly attributed to the formation of giant peroxisomes causing transport defects into the peroxisomal compartment (15.Piekarska K. Hardy G. Mol E. van den Burg J. Strijbis K. van Roermund C. van den Berg M. Distel B. The activity of the glyoxylate cycle in peroxisomes of Candida albicans depends on a functional β-oxidation pathway: evidence for reduced metabolite transport across the peroxisomal membrane.Microbiology. 2008; 154: 3061-3072Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the efficient removal of propionyl-CoA as a side product from the degradation of some amino acids and odd-chain fatty acid can be assumed to be important for the proliferation within the host. Accumulation of propionyl-CoA causes severe metabolic disorders not only in microorganisms but also in humans, where it is associated with life-threatening propionic aciduria and methylmalonic acidemia (16.Schwab M.A. Sauer S.W.

Propionyl-CoA affects polyketide synthesis, growth and morphology of conidia.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3615-3630Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) revealed that elevated propionyl-CoA concentrations interfere with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and the succinyl-CoA synthetase. Additionally, secondary metabolite production is affected under propionyl-CoA accumulation (21.Zhang Y.Q. Brock M. Keller N.P. Connection of propionyl-CoA metabolism to polyketide biosynthesis in Aspergillus nidulans.Genetics. 2004; 168: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Furthermore, A. fumigatus mutants, which are unable to metabolize propionyl-CoA, display strongly attenuated virulence in a murine infection model for pulmonary aspergillosis, indicating that propionyl-CoA is indeed formed from nutrients provided by the host (22.Ibrahim-Granet O. Dubourdeau M. Latgé J.P. Ave P. Huerre M. Brakhage A.A. Brock M. Methylcitrate synthase from Aspergillus fumigatus is essential for manifestation of invasive aspergillosis.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 134-148PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, detoxification of propionyl-CoA appears of general importance to maintain normal cellular functions. However, it is worth noting that humans and fungi use strikingly different metabolic pathways for propionyl-CoA degradation. In humans, propionyl-CoA is converted into the citric acid cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA, which requires a carboxylation to (R)-methylmalonyl-CoA, an isomerization to (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, and finally, a rearrangement of the carbon skeleton to succinyl-CoA via coenzyme B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (23.Chandler R.J. Venditti C.P. Genetic and genomic systems to study methylmalonic acidemia.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 86: 34-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 24.Brock M. Timmis K.N.

In contrast, most fungi seem to use the so-called methyl citrate cycle for the degradation of propionyl-CoA (24.Brock M. Timmis K.N. Handbook of Hydrocarbon and Lipid Microbiology. Springer, Berlin2010: 3279-3291Crossref Google Scholar). This pathway, which is also present in several bacteria (25.Müller S. Fleck C.B. Wilson D. Hummert C. Hube B. Brock M.

Although the reactions of this pathway resemble those of the citric acid and the glyoxylate cycle, the methyl citrate cycle uses its own specific set of enzymes. Interestingly, a third pathway for the degradation of propionyl-CoA has been described but has not been studied in detail at the molecular level. This pathway seems to proceed via a modified β-oxidation pathway and is characterized by the formation of β-hydroxypropionate. β-Hydroxypropionate has been detected in plant seedlings incubated in the presence of 13C-labeled propionate (31.Lucas K.A. Filley J.R. Erb J.M. Graybill E.R. Hawes J.W. Peroxisomal metabolism of propionic acid and isobutyric acid in plants.J. Biol.

Biotechnol. 2009; 19: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and most strikingly, in the yeast Candida rugosa (34.Miyakoshi S. Uchiyama H. Someya T. Satoh T. Tabuchi T.

Technol. 1982; 60: 591-594Google Scholar). It has been assumed that propionyl-CoA first enters the β-oxidation pathway of fatty acid degradation. Here, a fatty acyl-CoA oxidase or dehydrogenase forms acrylyl-CoA, which is hydrated to β-hydroxypropionyl-CoA. In a complete β-oxidation cycle, the hydroxyacyl-CoA is oxidized to the ketoacyl-CoA and finally cleaved by ketoacyl-CoA thiolases under the release of an acetyl-CoA unit (14.Otzen C. Müller S. Jacobsen I.D. Brock M. Phylogenetic and phenotypic characterisation of the 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase gene family from the opportunistic human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans.FEMS Yeast Res. 2013; 13: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This results in a residual acyl-CoA shortened by two carbon atoms which, in case of propionyl-CoA, would consist of the one carbon unit formyl-CoA. However, the detection of the key-metabolite β-hydroxypropionate suggests that the latter two reactions are not efficiently carried out. It has therefore been proposed that hydroxypropionyl-CoA exits the β-oxidation pathway and is converted by a series of reactions via hydroxypropionate, malonate semialdehyde and malonate to acetyl-CoA and CO2 (31.Lucas K.A. Filley J.R. Erb J.M. Graybill E.R. Hawes J.W. Peroxisomal metabolism of propionic acid and isobutyric acid in plants.J. Biol.

B. 1989; 92: 227-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, evidence for enzymes performing these reactions still has only partially been provided. Because previous studies on A. fumigatus demonstrated that the accumulation of intermediates from propionate degradation affects virulence (22.Ibrahim-Granet O. Dubourdeau M. Latgé J.P. Ave P. Huerre M. Brakhage A.A. Brock M. Methylcitrate synthase from Aspergillus fumigatus is essential for manifestation of invasive aspergillosis.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 134-148PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested in elucidating the respective pathway in the dimorphic and pathogenic yeast C. albicans. To identify the responsible pathway, we performed growth analyses, two-dimensional proteomics, gene deletions, metabolite analyses, recombinant protein production, and enzyme characterizations. Additionally, virulence of a selected mutant was studied in a murine infection model to investigate the impact of propionyl-CoA degradation on host infection. For standard cultivation, C. albicans strains were grown in 20 ml of YPD (per liter: 10 g of yeast extract, 20 g of peptone, and 20 g of glucose) or Candida minimal medium (CMM) 2The abbreviations used are: CMMCandida minimal mediumBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolCHES2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acidCAPS3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid.

Liquid cultures were generally incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm on a rotary shaker. Solid media were prepared by the addition of 2% agar. CMM was supplemented with one of the following carbon sources: 50 mm glucose, 50 mm sodium acetate, 50 mm sodium propionate, 10 mm sodium butyrate, 10 mm sodium valerate, or 10 mm sodium hexanoate. Amino acids as nutrient sources were generally added in a final concentration between 10 and 50 mm and replaced the nitrogen source (NH4)2SO4. For spot dilution growth analyses, C. albicans SC5314 wild type, mutants, and complemented strains were pre-grown in YPD, washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), adjusted to 3.3 × 105 cells/μl, and serially diluted (1:10 dilutions). From each dilution, 3 μl were spotted onto YPD and CMM agar plates containing the above mentioned carbon sources. When propionate or valerate were tested as substrates in spot dilution assays, ethanol from the vitamin solution was omitted to prevent initial growth of C. albicans by ethanol utilization. Plates were incubated at 30 and 37 °C. Plates were analyzed after 1 day on YPD, 2 days on glucose, or 4 days on all other nutrient sources. Growth analyses were carried out in triplicate with at least two independent deletion and complemented strains. Growth curves from liquid media were recorded by removing aliquots at different time points, dilution of samples in PBS, and determination of optical density at 600 nm on a Lambda25 UV-visible double beam spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

C. albicans SC5314 wild-type cells were preincubated for 14 h in CMM + 50 mm glucose and collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. CMM containing either 50 mm glucose, acetate, or propionate were inoculated at an OD600 of 0.2. Glucose cultures were incubated at 30 °C for 8 h and acetate and propionate cultures for 18 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 4000 × g at 20 °C for 10 min; the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution (3.99 g of TCA, 0.09 g of DTT in 30 ml of acetone). Cells were disrupted using a speed mill (Analytik Jena, Jena, Germany) in the presence of zirconia beads (0.5–0.7 mm, Roth, Karlsruhe Germany). Cell lysis was performed by two intervals of 2 min with 2-min cooling on ice. Samples were stored at −20 °C for 16 h to allow for complete protein precipitation and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. The precipitate was washed twice with 1 ml of washing solution (0.09 g of DTT in 30 ml of 90% acetone) and air-dried. After all residual acetone had evaporated, 300 μl of lysis buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2% CHAPS, 30 mm Tris, 1% Zwittergent, 0.8% Pharmalyte 3-10, 20 mm DTT) was added and mixed by vigorous shaking. Samples were incubated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min and subsequently incubated at −80 °C for 1 h. Samples were thawed at room temperature and centrifuged at 12,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentration was determined by the protein assay kit from Bio-Rad using bovine serum albumin as standard. Isoelectric focusing and second-dimension electrophoresis were performed with some modifications as described previously (36.Kniemeyer O. Lessing F. Scheibner O. Hertweck C. Brakhage A.A. Optimisation of a 2-D gel electrophoresis protocol for the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In brief, for isoelectric focusing, 11-cm Immobilize dry strips, pH 3–11NL (GE Healthcare), were used. Strips were rehydrated in rehydration buffer as recommended by the manufacturer. Isoelectric focusing was performed using an Ettan II isoelectric focusing system (GE Healthcare). To a 100-μg protein sample in a maximum volume of 100 μl, 2.5 μl of DeStreak reagent (GE Healthcare) and 1 μl of IPG-buffer 3-11 NL (0.5%, GE Healthcare) were added, and the solution was applied to the strips by cup loading. The following program was used for isoelectric focusing: 0–3 h at 300 V; 3–7-h gradient to 600 V; 7–8-h gradient to 1000 V; 11–15-h gradient to 8000 V and hold for additional 24,000 V-h. Prior to second-dimension electrophoresis on 12.5% Criterion Precast gels (Tris/HCl, 1.0 mm for 11-cm IPG Strips, Bio-Rad), strips were equilibrated in reducing equilibration buffer containing iodoacetamide for protein acetylation (36.Kniemeyer O. Lessing F. Scheibner O. Hertweck C. Brakhage A.A. Optimisation of a 2-D gel electrophoresis protocol for the human-pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.Curr. Genet. 2006; 49: 178-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Gels were run for 1 h at constant 200 V. After fixation for at least 2 h in fixing solution (40% (v/v) methanol and 7% acetic acid), gels were washed in distilled water and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (37.Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Improved staining of proteins in polyacrylamide gels including isoelectric focusing gels with clear background at nanogram sensitivity using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 and R-250.Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). The gels were neutralized for 5 min in 100 mm Tris/o-phosphoric acid, pH 6.5, and kept at 4 °C in water until analyzed. Stained gels were scanned and manually overlaid for spot selection. Protein spots of interest were manually excised from the gels and subjected to a tryptic digest (200 ng of trypsin; Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Protein fragments were extracted and prepared for MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis (38.Vödisch M. Albrecht D. Lessing F. Schmidt A.D. Winkler R. Guthke R. Brakhage A.A. Kniemeyer O. Two-dimensional proteome reference maps for the human pathogenic filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus.Proteomics. 2009; 9: 1407-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the extracted peptides was mixed with the same amount of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix solved in TA30 (30% acetonitrile + 70% of 0.1% TFA). 2 μl were spotted onto a 800/384 anchor chip target (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Peptide mass analysis and peptide sequence determination were performed on a Bruker ultraflex TOF/TOF with Bruker Compass 1.2 software suite, including FlexControl (hardware control) and FlexAnalysis 3.0 (peak list creation). The following parameter settings for peak list generation were used: signal-to-noise ratio = 4; maximum number of peaks = 500; algorithm = SavitzkyGolay (width = 0.15 m/z, cycles = 4). The Proteinscape 1.3 software was used to collect peak lists that were sent to the Mascot in-house server 2.1.03 equipped with a monthly updated NCBI nonredundant database (taxonomy, fungi) for protein identification. For MS analysis, a peptide mass fingerprint search was performed with the following parameter settings: peptide mass tolerance ±50 ppm, peptide charge state = 1+; maximum of missed cleavages = 0–1. For further analysis, an MS/MS ion search was used. The parameters were set to peptide mass tolerance = ±300 ppm; fragment mass tolerance = ±1 Da; maximum of missed cleavages = 1. For statistical analysis, a based Mowse score was calculated automatically by the Proteinscape software. The deletion cassettes were generated by procedures described previously (14.Otzen C.

The nature of the PECAM-1·Gαq/11 interaction is still unclear although it is likely an indirect association. Here, we investigated the role of heparan sulfates (HS) in mediating this interaction and in regulating downstream signaling in response to flow. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that PECAM-1·Gαq/11 binding is dramatically decreased by competitive inhibition with heparin, pharmacological inhibition with the HS antagonist surfen, and enzymatic removal of HS chains with heparinase III treatment as well as by site-directed mutagenesis of basic residues within the extracellular domain of PECAM-1. Using an in situ proximity ligation assay, we show that endogenous PECAM-1·Gαq/11 interactions in endothelial cells are disrupted by both competitive inhibition and HS degradation. Furthermore, we identified the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 in complexes with PECAM-1 that are rapidly decreased in response to flow. Finally, we demonstrate that flow-induced Akt activation is attenuated in endothelial cells in which PECAM-1 was knocked down and reconstituted with a binding mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2106539849,"Myofibroblast differentiation is a key process in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease. We have shown previously that differentiation of myofibroblasts is regulated by microtubule polymerization state. In this work, we examined the potential antifibrotic effects of the antitussive drug, noscapine, recently found to bind microtubules and affect microtubule dynamics. Noscapine inhibited TGF-β-induced differentiation of cultured human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Therapeutic noscapine treatment resulted in a significant attenuation of pulmonary fibrosis in the bleomycin model of the disease. Noscapine did not affect gross microtubule content in HLFs, but inhibited TGF-β-induced stress fiber formation and activation of serum response factor without affecting Smad signaling. Furthermore, noscapine stimulated a rapid and profound activation of protein kinase A (PKA), which mediated the antifibrotic effect of noscapine in HLFs, as assessed with the PKA inhibitor, PKI. In contrast, noscapine did not activate PKA in human bronchial or alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, activation of PKA and the antifibrotic effect of noscapine in HLFs were blocked by the EP2 prostaglandin E2 receptor antagonist, PF-04418948, but not by the antagonists of EP4, prostaglandin D2, or prostacyclin receptors. Together, we demonstrate for the first time the antifibrotic effect of noscapine in vitro and in vivo, and we describe a novel mechanism of noscapine action through EP2 prostaglandin E2 receptor-mediated activation of PKA in pulmonary fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2010546482,"Acute lung injury (ALI) and its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of death in critical care. Despite extensive efforts in research and clinical medicine, mortality remains high in these diseases. Perfluorocarbon (PFC), a chemical compound known as liquid ventilation medium, is capable of dissolving large amounts of physiologically important gases (mainly oxygen and carbon dioxide). In this study we aimed to investigate the effect of intravenous infusion of PFC emulsion on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced ALI in rats and elucidate its mechanism of action. Forty two Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: 6 rats were treated with saline solution by intratracheal instillation (control group), 18 rats were treated with LPS by intratracheal instillation (LPS group) and the other 18 rats received PFC through femoral vein prior to LPS instillation (LPS+PFC group). The rats in the control group were sacrificed 6 hours later after saline instillation. At 2, 4 and 6 hours of exposure to LPS, 6 rats in the LPS group and 6 rats in LPS+PFC group were sacrificed at each time point. By analyzing pulmonary pathology, partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO2) and lung wet-dry weight ratio (W/D) of each rat, we found that intravenous infusion of PFC significantly alleviated acute lung injury induced by LPS. Moreover, we showed that the expression of pulmonary myeloperoxidase (MPO), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) of endothelial cells and CD11b of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) induced by LPS were significantly decreased by PFC treatment in vivo. Our results indicate that intravenous infusion of PFC inhibits the infiltration of PMNs into lung tissue, which has been shown as the core pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS. Thus, our study provides a theoretical foundation for using intravenous infusion of PFC to prevent and treat ALI/ARDS in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1978598424,"There is considerable interest in locally adapted breeds of livestock as reservoirs of genetic diversity that may provide important fitness traits for future use in agriculture. In marginal areas, these animals contribute to food security and extract value from land unsuitable for other systems of farming. In England, close to 50% of the national sheep flock is farmed on grassland designated as disadvantaged areas for agricultural production. Many of these areas are in the uplands, where some native breeds of sheep continue to be commercially farmed only in highly localised geographical regions to which they are adapted. This study focuses on three of these breeds, selected for their adaptation to near identical environments and their geographical concentration in regions close to one another. Our objective has been to use retrotyping, microsatellites and single nucleotide polymorphisms to explore the origins of the breeds and whether, despite their similar adaptations and proximity, they are genetically distinctive. We find the three breeds each have a surprisingly different pattern of retrovirus insertions into their genomes compared with one another and with other UK breeds. Uniquely, there is a high incidence of the R0 retrotype in the Herdwick population, characteristic of a primitive genome found previously in very few breeds worldwide and none in the UK mainland. The Herdwick and Rough Fells carry two rare retroviral insertion events, common only in Texels, suggesting sheep populations in the northern uplands have a historical association with the original pin-tail sheep of Texel Island. Microsatellite data and analyses of SNPs associated with RXFP2 (horn traits) and PRLR (reproductive performance traits) also distinguished the three breeds. Significantly, an SNP linked to TMEM154, a locus controlling susceptibility to infection by Maedi-Visna, indicated that all three native hill breeds have a lower than average risk of infection to the lentivirus."

https://openalex.org/W2032688578,"Equilibrative nucleoside transporters of the SLC29 family play important roles in many physiological and pharmacological processes, including import of drugs for treatment of cancer, AIDS, cardiovascular, and parasitic diseases. However, no crystal structure is available for any member of this family. In previous studies we generated a computational model of the Leishmania donovani nucleoside transporter 1.1 (LdNT1.1) that captured this permease in the outward-closed conformation, and we identified the extracellular gate. In the present study we have modeled the inward-closed conformation of LdNT1.1 using the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli fucose transporter FucP and have identified four transmembrane helices whose ends close to form a predicted intracellular gate. We have tested this prediction by site-directed mutagenesis of relevant helix residues and by cross-linking of introduced cysteine pairs. The results are consistent with the predictions of the computational model and suggest that a similarly constituted gate operates in other members of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter family."
https://openalex.org/W1967735960,"Notch1 is an evolutionarily conserved signaling molecule required for stem cell maintenance that is inappropriately reactivated in several cancers. We have previously shown that melanomas reactivate Notch1 and require its function for growth and survival. However, no Notch1-activating mutations have been observed in melanoma, suggesting the involvement of other activating mechanisms. Notch1 activation requires two cleavage steps: first by a protease and then by γ-secretase, which releases the active intracellular domain (Notch1NIC). Interestingly, although ADAM10 and -17 are generally accepted as the proteases responsible of Notch1 cleavage, here we show that MT1-MMP, a membrane-tethered matrix metalloproteinase involved in the pathogenesis of a number of tumors, is a novel protease required for the cleavage of Notch1 in melanoma cells. We find that active Notch1 and MT1-MMP expression correlate significantly in over 70% of melanoma tumors and 80% of melanoma cell lines, whereas such correlation does not exist between Notch1NIC and ADAM10 or -17. Modulation of MT1-MMP expression in melanoma cells affects Notch1 cleavage, whereas MT1-MMP expression in ADAM10/17 double knock-out fibroblasts restores the processing of Notch1, indicating that MT1-MMP is sufficient to promote Notch1 activation independently of the canonical proteases. Importantly, we find that MT1-MMP interacts with Notch1 at the cell membrane, supporting a potential direct cleavage mechanism of MT1-MMP on Notch1, and that MT1-MMP-dependent activation of Notch1 sustains melanoma cell growth. Together, the data highlight a novel mechanism of activation of Notch1 in melanoma cells and identify Notch1 as a new MT1-MMP substrate that plays important biological roles in melanoma.

Notch1 activation requires two cleavage steps: first by a protease and then by γ-secretase, which releases the active intracellular domain (Notch1NIC). Interestingly, although ADAM10 and -17 are generally accepted as the proteases responsible of Notch1 cleavage, here we show that MT1-MMP, a membrane-tethered matrix metalloproteinase involved in the pathogenesis of a number of tumors, is a novel protease required for the cleavage of Notch1 in melanoma cells. We find that active Notch1 and MT1-MMP expression correlate significantly in over 70% of melanoma tumors and 80% of melanoma cell lines, whereas such correlation does not exist between Notch1NIC and ADAM10 or -17. Modulation of MT1-MMP expression in melanoma cells affects Notch1 cleavage, whereas MT1-MMP expression in ADAM10/17 double knock-out fibroblasts restores the processing of Notch1, indicating that MT1-MMP is sufficient to promote Notch1 activation independently of the canonical proteases. Importantly, we find that MT1-MMP interacts with Notch1 at the cell membrane, supporting a potential direct cleavage mechanism of MT1-MMP on Notch1, and that MT1-MMP-dependent activation of Notch1 sustains melanoma cell growth. Together, the data highlight a novel mechanism of activation of Notch1 in melanoma cells and identify Notch1 as a new MT1-MMP substrate that plays important biological roles in melanoma."

In this report, we first showed that the liver expression of Sts was induced in both the high fat diet (HFD) and ob/ob models of obesity and type 2 diabetes and during the fed to fasting transition. In defining the functional relevance of STS induction in metabolic disease, we showed that overexpression of STS in the liver of transgenic mice alleviated HFD and ob/ob models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, including reduced body weight, improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Interestingly, STS exerted its metabolic benefit through sex-specific mechanisms. In female mice, STS may have increased hepatic estrogen activity by converting biologically inactive estrogen sulfates to active estrogens and consequently improved the metabolic functions, whereas ovariectomy abolished this protective effect. In contrast, the metabolic benefit of STS in males may have been accounted for by the male-specific decrease of inflammation in white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle as well as a pattern of skeletal muscle gene expression that favors energy expenditure. The metabolic benefit in male STS transgenic mice was retained after castration. Treatment with the STS substrate estrone sulfate also improved metabolic functions in both the HFD and ob/ob models. Our results have uncovered a novel function of STS in energy metabolism and type 2 diabetes.

Rickettsial methyltransferases RP789 and RP027-028 are the first biochemically characterized methyltransferases to catalyze methylation of outer membrane protein (OMP). Methylation in OMP remains poorly understood. Using semiquantitative integrated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, we characterize methylation of (i) recombinantly expressed fragments of Rickettsia typhi OmpB exposed in vitro to trimethyltransferases of Rickettsia prowazekii RP027-028 and of R. typhi RT0101 and to monomethyltransferases of R. prowazekii RP789 and of R. typhi RT0776, and (ii) native OmpBs purified from R. typhi and R. prowazekii strains Breinl, RP22, and Madrid E. We found that in vitro trimethylation occurs at relatively specific locations in OmpB with consensus motifs, KX(G/A/V/I)N and KT(I/L/F), whereas monomethylation is pervasive throughout OmpB.

It has been known for many years that the passenger domain of OmpB of Rickettsia is methylated, and OmpBs from virulent strains are more extensively methylated (14Ching W.M. Wang H. Davis J.

More recent studies using genetic and biochemical approaches are consistent with the suggestion that methylation of OmpB may contribute to both (i) the host immunogenic response to OmpB itself and (ii) rickettsial virulence (16Bechah Y.

For example, rabbit antiserum against recombinant OmpB is less reactive than antiserum against OmpB purified directly from Rickettsia (19Gilmore Jr., R.D. Cieplak Jr., W. Policastro P.F. Hackstadt T.

In addition, the immunoreactivity of chemically methylated recombinant OmpB is enhanced against sera from infected patients (20Chao C.C. Zhang Z. Wang H. Alkhalil A. Ching W.M.

Thus, methylation of recombinant OmpB could increase the efficacy of diagnostic reagents and help advance vaccine development against Rickettsia (21Chan Y.G. Riley S.P. Chen E. Martinez J.J. Molecular basis of immunity to rickettsial infection conferred through outer membrane protein B.Infect. Immun. 2011; 79: 2303-2313Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein methylation is a well established post-translational modification known to regulate functions of various proteins (22Paik W.K. Paik D.C. Kim S. Historical review.

The emerging field of dynamic lysine methylation of non-histone proteins.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2008; 18: 152-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The regulatory potential of this modification can be attributed in part to the multiple states of methylation at the ϵ-amino group of lysine, which can be mono-, di-, and trimethylated (26Botuyan M.V. Lee J. Ward I.M. Kim J.-E. Thompson J.R. Chen J. Mer G. Structural basis for the methylation state-specific recognition of histone H4-K20 by 53BP1 and Crb2 in DNA repair.Cell. 2006; 127: 1361-1373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). Unlike the methylation of histones, which has been well established, methylation of outer membrane proteins is not well characterized, particularly at the molecular level. We have recently characterized two rickettsial lysine methyltransferases (MTs) (27Abeykoon A.H. Chao C.-C. Wang G. Gucek M. Yang D.C. Ching W.-M. Two protein lysine methyltransferases methylate outer membrane protein B from rickettsia.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They are RP789 (PKMT1) and RP027-028 (PKMT2) from Rickettsia prowazekii. RP027-028, as well as its counterpart in Rickettsia typhi, RT0101, catalyzes trimethylation, and RP789 catalyzes monomethylation of rOmpB fragments, monitored by incorporation of radioactive [methyl-3H] from [methyl-3H]AdoMet and Western blot analysis, whereas none of these MTs can methylate either histone or Escherichia coli protein. These are the first biochemically characterized MTs to catalyze the methylation of OMPs and appear to belong to a novel family of protein lysine MTs. The gene sequences of homologous MTs are found to be conserved in more than 40 rickettsial species and strains. The fact that these MTs recognize OmpB at many diverse sites suggests an unusual substrate recognition mechanism. Characterization of methylation in rickettsial OmpB at the molecular level is essential for elucidating the roles of methylation in bacterial virulence and pathogenesis. Moreover, findings on the rickettsial OmpB methylation may advance our understanding of the structure and function of protein lysine methylation in general. In addition, enzymatic methylation of recombinant OmpB may also provide improved methods over chemical methylation in efforts to advance diagnostic reagents and vaccine candidates. To better understand OmpB methylation, we used semiquantitative integrated LC-MS/MS techniques to characterize the location, state and level of methylation. Our study provides the first characterization of methylation in an OMP and lays the foundation for further understanding how methylation of OmpB may contribute to the virulence of Rickettsia. Native OmpB proteins from R. typhi and R. prowazekii strains Breinl, RP22, and Madrid E were extracted using 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) at 45 °C for 30 min and purified as described previously (28Dasch G.A. Isolation of species-specific protein antigens of Rickettsia typhi and Rickettsia prowazekii for immunodiagnosis and immunoprophylaxis.J. Clin. Microbiol. 1981; 14: 333-341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the native OmpB proteins showed a single band at Mr 114,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Recombinant R. typhi OmpB fragments OmpB(AN) and OmpB(K), which corresponded to residues Met33 to Phe744 and Arg745 to Gly1353, respectively, were expressed and purified as previously described (20Chao C.C. Zhang Z. Wang H. Alkhalil A. Ching W.M. Serological reactivity and biochemical characterization of methylated and unmethylated forms of a recombinant protein fragment derived from outer membrane protein B of Rickettsia typhi.Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2008; 15: 684-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bacterial proteins that were expressed in inclusion bodies were dissolved in 8 m urea and 1% deoxycholate, purified by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in 6 m urea. Soluble proteins were obtained by slow dialysis at stepwise decreasing concentrations of urea. No methylated lysine in recombinant OmpB(AN) and (K) were detected by LC-MS/MS. Protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assays with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Purified recombinant R. prowazekii RP789 (NP221139) and RP027-028 (ADE29537) and R. typhi RT0776 (YP067714) and RT0101 (YP067069) were used in enzymatic methylation of OmpB fragments in the present study. The MTs were prepared by the same method as previously described (27Abeykoon A.H. Chao C.-C. Wang G. Gucek M. Yang D.C. Ching W.-M. Two protein lysine methyltransferases methylate outer membrane protein B from rickettsia.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). No methyllysines in recombinant MTs were found as determined by LC-MS/MS. The plasmids expressing RP789ΔN (deletion of N-terminal 28 residues) and RT0776ΔN (deletion of N-terminal 27 residues) were constructed in pET28a by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA using the plasmids encoding RP789 and RT0776, respectively, as templates. Primer sequences are available on request. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Expression and purification was performed as described previously (27Abeykoon A.H. Chao C.-C. Wang G. Gucek M. Yang D.C. Ching W.-M. Two protein lysine methyltransferases methylate outer membrane protein B from rickettsia.J. Bacteriol. 2012; 194: 6410-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The standard assay mixture contained, in 50 μl of final volume, 8.3 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 0.16 mm [methyl-3H]AdoMet (34 mCi/mmol diluted from 10 Ci/mmol [methyl-3H]AdoMet, which has a >97% purity obtained from PerkinElmer, with the highest purity AdoMet purchased from New England Biolabs) and 2 μm OmpB(AN) or 1 μm OmpB(K). The reactions were initiated by adding MT to a final concentration of 0.26 μm and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted at the indicated time onto Whatman 3MM cellulose filter paper discs (Fisher Scientific) and soaked briefly with 5% TCA. The paper discs were washed three times with 5% ice-cold TCA, followed by washing with ethanol:ether (1:1 by v/v) mixture. The amounts of acid precipitable radioactivity were determined using a PerkinElmer Wallace 1410 liquid scintillation counter. The assay conditions were optimized by varying pH. DTT, KCl, and cations reduce the activity of MT, and none of them was included in the assay. Initial rates of MT-catalyzed reactions were determined from the linear portions of the time courses of methylation at varying concentrations of OmpB(AN) up to 2 μm using the radioactivity assay at 37 °C. These initial rates were used to determine the Michaelis-Menten and catalytic constants. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the specified MT to a final concentration of 0.26 μm. Michaelis-Menten constants and maximum velocities were obtained by direct fit using KaleidaGraph. It should be noted that the initial rates thus determined represent the sum of initial rates of numerous enzymatic methylation reactions at multiple lysine residues in OmpB(AN) to three different methylation states whose rates may vary with wide ranges. The Michaelis-Menten and catalytic constants based on the radioactivity assay can only be considered as apparent Michaelis-Menten and catalytic constants. OmpB(AN) (10 μg) and OmpB(K) (5 μg) were methylated separately using 10 μg of specified MT in 50 μl of reaction mixtures containing 3.2 mm AdoMet (New England Biolabs) and 8.3 mm sodium phosphate (pH 8.0). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixture was evaporated to 20 μl using SpeedVac and mixed with SDS sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and OmpB(AN) and (K) protein bands were excised from the gel and subjected to in-gel digestion. Native OmpB proteins (2 μg each) were separated by SDS-PAGE, excised from the gel, and processed for in-gel digestion. Multiple samples of enzymatically methylated rOmpB and native OmpB proteins were independently prepared and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. In-gel digestion of proteins was carried out as described with modifications (29Kinter M. Sherman N.E. Protein Sequencing and Identification using Tandem Mass Spectroscopy. Wiley-Interscience, 2000: 154-157Google Scholar). Briefly, the excised protein bands from SDS gels were washed using 50% methanol and 5% acetic acid, followed by reduction using 10 mm DTT. The protein samples were alkylated with 100 mm iodoacetamide in the dark. The gel pieces were dehydrated using acetonitrile and rehydrated with 100 mm (NH4)HCO3 twice. The gel pieces were mixed with 1 μg of sequencing grade chymotrypsin (Roche Applied Science) in 50 mm (NH4)HCO3 and digested overnight at 25 °C. The digested peptides were extracted with 50% (v/v) acetonitrile and 5% (v/v) formic acid. The volume was reduced to less than 20 μl by evaporation, and the final volume was adjusted to 20 μl using 1% formic acid. The samples were purified using Zip-Tip with C18 resin (Millipore, Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LC-MS/MS was performed using an Eksigent nanoLC-Ultra two-dimensional system (Dublin, CA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA). Peptide sample was first loaded onto a Zorbax 300SB-C18 trap column (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA) at a flow rate of 6 μl/min for 9 min and then separated on a reversed phase BetaBasic C18 PicoFrit analytical column (New Objective, Woburn, MA) using a 40-min linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 250 nl/min. Eluted peptides were sprayed into the mass spectrometer equipped with a nano-spray ionization source. Survey MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 60,000. Each MS scan was followed by six data-dependent MS/MS scans in the linear ion trap with dynamic exclusion. Other mass spectrometry settings were as follows: spray voltage, 1.5 kV; full MS mass range, m/z 300–2000; and normalized collision energy, 35%. Data files generated from the mass spectrometer were analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v1.3 software (Thermo Scientific) and the Mascot search engine running on a six-processor cluster at the National Institutes of Health (version 2.3). The search criteria were set to: database, Swiss-Prot (Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics); taxonomy, Bacteria; enzyme, chymotrypsin; maximal miscleavages, 3; variable modifications, methylation (K), dimethylation (K), trimethylation (K), oxidation (M), and deamidation (N, Q); fixed modifications, carbamidomethylation (C); peptide precursor mass tolerance, 25 ppm; and MS/MS fragment mass tolerance, 0.8 Da. Peptide-spectrum matches (PSM) were filtered to achieve an estimated false discovery rate of 1%. In this study, mass errors of 3 ppm or less were routinely achieved with the Orbitrap mass spectrometer used in the present study. This high mass accuracy allowed us to differentiate between trimethylation and acetylation or between dimethylation and formylation, which have a mass difference of 0.03639 Da, equivalent to 11–45 ppm given that most peptide precursors had an m/z value between 400 and 1100 with a charge state of either +2 or +3. Even though a peptide mass tolerance of 25 ppm was used in database search, the application of a mass deviation filter (e.g., <5 ppm) established confidence that the tri- or di-methylation sites identified were not due to acetylation or formylation. Fig. 1A shows the overall scheme of this analysis. The spectral matches of a peptide by MS/MS revealed the amino acid sequence, location, and state of methylation. In addition, LC-MS/MS of the peptides provides the number of peptide spectrum matches of all peptides at unmethylated and mono-, di-, and trimethylated states throughout the OmpB sequence. For multiple measurements, independently prepared samples were used. The MS data are reproducible in types and locations of methylation in independently prepared samples of OmpB and its fragments. The number of PSM correlates with the abundance of individual peptide (30Zybailov B. Rutschow H. Friso G. Rudella A. Emanuelsson O. Sun Q. van Wijk K.J. Sorting signals, N-terminal modifications and abundance of the chloroplast proteome.PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The observed numbers of PSM vary with the behavior of various peptides in ionization, ion detection, and chromatography and with the amount of protein samples. The variations are progressively lower for greater values of PSM. For comparison of methylations at different locations in OmpB, normalized fraction of methylation (from 0 to 1) is used to compare the relative levels of various methylation states at a specific lysine residue. The peptide coverage in LC-MS/MS analyses is close to the entire sequence of OmpB or the fragments in all cases. It should be pointed out that in the chymotryptic digests, the fragments containing Lys149 and Lys157 were consistently not detected, likely because of retaining by the chromatographic resins. Custom software PTMsite was used to compute the numbers of PSM at unmethylated and mono-, di-, and trimethylated states for all lysine residues throughout OmpB based on the results of LC-MS/MS of each sample. Normalized fractions of mono-, di-, and trimethylations of a specific lysine residue were calculated from the observed PSM numbers of respective mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptides divided by the total number of observed PSM numbers including unmethylated and mono-, di-, and trimethylated peptides of the corresponding lysine residue. For multiple trials of a protein, the normalized fractions were calculated from the sums of the PSM numbers of each methylated state at the lysine residue from multiple trials divided by the sum of PSM numbers of all methylation states of all trials at the same lysine residue. Expression of the passenger domain of OmpB from R. typhi in E. coli produces inclusion bodies. However, recombinant OmpB (rOmpB) fragments OmpB(AN) and OmpB(K), which correspond to the N- and C-terminal halves of OmpB passenger domain (Fig. 1B), can be successfully purified and refolded to yield soluble protein substrates for analysis. Using the OmpB(AN) as the substrate of MTs, we analyzed the steady state kinetics of two MTs from R. prowazekii (RP789 and RP027-028) and two MTs from R. typhi (RT0766 and RT0101). Table 1 summarizes the steady state kinetic parameters based on the initial rates of the methylation of OmpB(AN) catalyzed by 0.26 μm each of the four MTs by monitoring the incorporation of radioactive [methyl-3H] from [methyl-3H]AdoMet to OmpB(AN). Monomethyltransferases RT0776 and RP789 exhibit an appreciably higher kcat than those of trimethyltransferases RT0101 and RP027-028. In addition, the enzyme efficiency (kcat/Km) of RP789 is higher than that of RT0776, whereas RT0101 is more active than RP027-028.TABLE 1Kinetic parameters of Rickettsial methyltransferasesMethyltransferaseKmANkcatkcat/Kmμms−1m−1·s−1RT01010.48 ± 0.0570.83 × 10−31.74 × 103RP027-028aRP027-028-catalyzed methylation was analyzed at 2 μm RP027-028 and 2–20 μm OmpB(AN) because of the low enzyme efficiency.10.1 ± 1.630.16 × 10−30.015 × 103RP7890.29 ± 0.0935.98 × 10−320.6 × 103RP789ΔN1.13 ± 0.173.32 × 10−32.93 × 103RT07761.71 ± 0.1822.20 × 10−31.28 × 103RT0776ΔN3.07 ± 1.554.45 × 10−31.45 × 103a RP027-028-catalyzed methylation was analyzed at 2 μm RP027-028 and 2–20 μm OmpB(AN) because of the low enzyme efficiency. Open table in a new tab Because catalytic activity of MTs is relatively modest, we used 2 μm of trimethyltransferase to prepare enzymatically methylated rOmpB for the LC-MS/MS analysis. The time courses for the methylation of OmpB(AN) (2 μm) and OmpB(K) (1 μm) catalyzed by 2 μm trimethyltransferase RT0101 are shown in Fig. 2A and remain linear for at least 4 h. Similar time courses were also obtained for the methylation of rOmpB fragments catalyzed by 2 μm monomethyltransferase RT0776 (Fig. 2B). To determine methylation profiles in rOmpB, OmpB(AN) and OmpB(K) were enzymatically methylated using 2 μm RT0101 and 3.2 mm AdoMet. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the methylated OmpB(AN) and OmpB(K) were separated using SDS-PAGE followed by in-gel digestion and LC-MS/MS analysis. The numbers of PSM at four methylation states of all lysine residues in OmpB(AN) and OmpB(K) are shown in supplemental Table S1. The LC-MS/MS analysis reveals a total of 133 trimethyllysine-containing PSM distributed among 16 locations in OmpB. In contrast, nine monomethyllysine-containing PSM and one dimethyllysine-containing PSM were observed (supplemental Table S1). The predominance of trimethyllysine-containing PSM clearly shows that RT0101 is functioned mainly as a trimethyltransferase. The observed mono- and dimethylations could conceivably represent intermediates of trimethylation. Normalized fractions of trimethylation at all lysine residues in rOmpB were calculated for RT0101-catalyzed methylation (Fig. 2C). The normalized fractions reveal that specific lysine residues are trimethylated at varying levels from less than 1% to 36%. No single consensus sequences can be discerned based on the amino acid sequences adjacent to the trimethylated lysines. Our attempt to uncover amino acid sequence motifs of RT0101-catalyzed trimethylation using Motif-X (31Chou M.F. Schwartz D. Biological sequence motif discovery using motif-x.Curr. Protoc.

https://openalex.org/W2015343942,"Ball game players frequently perform changes of direction (CODs) while running; however, there has been little research on the physiological impact of CODs. In particular, the effect of running velocity on the physiological and energy demands of CODs while running has not been clearly determined. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between running velocity and the energy cost of a 180°COD and to quantify the energy cost of a 180°COD. Nine male university students (aged 18-22 years) participated in the study. Five shuttle trials were performed in which the subjects were required to run at different velocities (3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 km/h). Each trial consisted of four stages with different turn frequencies (13, 18, 24 and 30 per minute), and each stage lasted 3 minutes. Oxygen consumption was measured during the trial. The energy cost of a COD significantly increased with running velocity (except between 7 and 8 km/h, p = 0.110). The relationship between running velocity and the energy cost of a 180°COD is best represented by a quadratic function (y = -0.012+0.066x +0.008x(2), [r = 0.994, p = 0.001]), but is also well represented by a linear (y = -0.228+0.152x, [r = 0.991, p<0.001]). These data suggest that even low running velocities have relatively high physiological demands if the COD frequency increases, and that running velocities affect the physiological demands of CODs. These results also showed that the energy expenditure of COD can be evaluated using only two data points. These results may be useful for estimating the energy expenditure of players during a match and designing shuttle exercise training programs."
https://openalex.org/W1994742342,"We previously identified CvfA (SA1129) as a Staphylococcus aureus virulence factor using a silkworm infection model. S. aureus cvfA-deleted mutants exhibit decreased expression of the agr locus encoding a positive regulator of hemolysin genes and decreased hemolysin production. CvfA protein hydrolyzes a 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester bond at the RNA 3' terminus, producing RNA with a 3'-phosphate (3'-phosphorylated RNA, RNA with a 3'-phosphate). Here, we report that the cvfA-deleted mutant phenotype (decreased agr expression and hemolysin production) was suppressed by disrupting pnpA-encoding polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) with 3'- to 5'-exonuclease activity. The suppression was blocked by introducing a pnpA-encoding PNPase with exonuclease activity but not by a pnpA-encoding mutant PNPase without exonuclease activity. Therefore, loss of PNPase exonuclease activity suppressed the cvfA-deleted mutant phenotype. Purified PNPase efficiently degraded RNA with 2',3'-cyclic phosphate at the 3' terminus (2',3'-cyclic RNA), but it inefficiently degraded 3'-phosphorylated RNA. These findings indicate that 3'-phosphorylated RNA production from 2',3'-cyclic RNA by CvfA prevents RNA degradation by PNPase and contributes to the expression of agr and hemolysin genes. We speculate that in the cvfA-deleted mutant, 2',3'-cyclic RNA is not converted to the 3'-phosphorylated form and is efficiently degraded by PNPase, resulting in the loss of RNA essential for expressing agr and hemolysin genes, whereas in the cvfA/pnpA double-disrupted mutant, 2',3'-cyclic RNA is not degraded by PNPase, leading to hemolysin production. These findings suggest that CvfA and PNPase competitively regulate RNA degradation essential for S. aureus virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2105495798,"The present study was designed to examine the functional relevance of two heterozygous mutations (H391Y and K422R), observed earlier by us in the Bloom syndrome condition. Cells stably expressing exogenous wild-type or mutant PKM2 (K422R or H391Y) or co-expressing both wild type and mutant (PKM2-K422R or PKM2-H391Y) were assessed for cancer metabolism and tumorigenic potential. Interestingly, cells co-expressing PKM2 and mutant (K422R or H391Y) showed significantly aggressive cancer metabolism as compared with cells expressing either wild-type or mutant PKM2 independently. A similar trend was observed for oxidative endurance, tumorigenic potential, cellular proliferation, and tumor growth. These observations signify the dominant negative nature of mutations. Remarkably, PKM2-H391Y co-expressed cells showed a maximal effect on all the studied parameters. Such a dominant negative impaired function of PKM2 in tumor development is not known; this study demonstrates for the first time the possible predisposition of Bloom syndrome patients with impaired PKM2 activity to cancer and the importance of studying genetic variations in PKM2 in the future to understand their relevance in cancer in general."
https://openalex.org/W2011938085,"Background Previous studies have demonstrated that less-differentiated T cells are ideal for adoptive T cell transfer therapy (ACT) and that fibronectin CH296 (FN-CH296) together with anti-CD3 resulted in cultured cells that contain higher amounts of less-differentiated T cells. In this phase I clinical trial, we build on these prior results by assessing the safety and efficacy of FN-CH296 stimulated T cell therapy in patients with advanced cancer. Methods Patients underwent fibronectin CH296-stimulated T cell therapy up to six times every two weeks and the safety and antitumor activity of the ACT were assessed. In order to determine immune function, whole blood cytokine levels and the number of peripheral regulatory T cells were analyzed prior to ACT and during the follow up. Results Transferred cells contained numerous less-differentiated T cells greatly represented by CD27+CD45RA+ or CD28+CD45RA+ cell, which accounted for approximately 65% and 70% of the total, respectively. No ACT related severe or unexpected toxicities were observed. The response rate among patients was 22.2% and the disease control rate was 66.7%. Conclusions The results obtained in this phase I trial, indicate that FN-CH296 stimulated T cell therapy was very well tolerated with a level of efficacy that is quite promising. We also surmise that expanding T cell using CH296 is a method that can be applied to other T- cell-based therapies. Trial Registration UMIN UMIN000001835"
https://openalex.org/W2107741495,"Delineating the kinetic and thermodynamic factors which contribute to the stability of transmembrane β-barrels is critical to gain an in-depth understanding of membrane protein behavior. Human mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel isoform 2 (hVDAC-2), one of the key anti-apoptotic eukaryotic β-barrel proteins, is of paramount importance, owing to its indispensable role in cell survival. We demonstrate here that the stability of hVDAC-2 bears a strong kinetic contribution that is dependent on the absolute micellar concentration used for barrel folding. The refolding efficiency and ensuing stability is sensitive to the lipid-to-protein (LPR) ratio, and displays a non-linear relationship, with both low and high micellar amounts being detrimental to hVDAC-2 structure. Unfolding and aggregation process are sequential events and show strong temperature dependence. We demonstrate that an optimal lipid-to-protein ratio of 2600∶1 – 13000∶1 offers the highest protection against thermal denaturation. Activation energies derived only for lower LPRs are ∼17 kcal mol−1 for full-length hVDAC-2 and ∼23 kcal mol−1 for the Cys-less mutant, suggesting that the nine cysteine residues of hVDAC-2 impart additional malleability to the barrel scaffold. Our studies reveal that cysteine residues play a key role in the kinetic stability of the protein, determine barrel rigidity and thereby give rise to strong micellar association of hVDAC-2. Non-linearity of the Arrhenius plot at high LPRs coupled with observation of protein aggregation upon thermal denaturation indicates that contributions from both kinetic and thermodynamic components stabilize the 19-stranded β-barrel. Lipid-protein interaction and the linked kinetic contribution to free energy of the folded protein are together expected to play a key role in hVDAC-2 recycling and the functional switch at the onset of apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1975644499,"The signaling molecule cAMP primarily mediates its effects by activating PKA and/or exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac). Epac has been implicated in many responses in cells, but its precise roles have been difficult to define in the absence of Epac inhibitors. Epac, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the low molecular weight G protein Rap, is directly activated by cAMP. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assay (CAMYEL) to examine modulators of Epac activity, we took advantage of its intramolecular movement that occurs upon cAMP binding to assess Epac activation. We found that the use of CAMYEL can detect the binding of cAMP analogs to Epac and their modulation of its activity and can distinguish between agonists (cAMP), partial agonists (8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP), and super agonists (8-chlorophenylthio-2'-O-Me-cAMP). The CAMYEL assay can also identify competitive and uncompetitive Epac inhibitors, e.g. (Rp)-cAMPS and CE3F4, respectively. To confirm the results with the CAMYEL assay, we used Swiss 3T3 cells and assessed the ability of cyclic nucleotide analogs to modulate the activity of Epac or PKA, determined by Rap1 activity or VASP phosphorylation, respectively. We used computational molecular modeling to analyze the interaction of analogs with Epac1. The results reveal a rapid means to identify modulators (potentially including allosteric inhibitors) of Epac activity that also provides insight into the mechanisms of Epac activation and inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2074223177,"Learning how to allocate attention properly is essential for success at many categorization tasks. Advances in our understanding of learned attention are stymied by a chicken-and-egg problem: there are no theoretical accounts of learned attention that predict patterns of eye movements, making data collection difficult to justify, and there are not enough datasets to support the development of a rich theory of learned attention. The present work addresses this by reporting five measures relating to the overt allocation of attention across 10 category learning experiments: accuracy, probability of fixating irrelevant information, number of fixations to category features, the amount of change in the allocation of attention (using a new measure called Time Proportion Shift - TIPS), and a measure of the relationship between attention change and erroneous responses. Using these measures, the data suggest that eye-movements are not substantially connected to error in most cases and that aggregate trial-by-trial attention change is generally stable across a number of changing task variables. The data presented here provide a target for computational models that aim to account for changes in overt attentional behaviors across learning."
https://openalex.org/W1966639043,"Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which is up regulated in kidney diseases, is considered a marker of kidney inflammation. We examined the value of urine MCP-1 in predicting the outcome in idiopathic glomerulonephritis.Between 1993 and 2004, 165 patients (68 females) diagnosed with idiopathic proteinuric glomerulopathy and with serum creatinine <150 µmol/L at diagnosis were selected for the study. Urine concentrations of MCP-1 were analyzed by ELISA in early morning spot urine samples collected on the day of the diagnostic kidney biopsy. The patients were followed until 2009. The progression rate to end-stage kidney disease was calculated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. End-stage kidney disease (ESKD) was defined as the start of kidney replacement therapy during the study follow-up time.Patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis had significantly higher urinary MCP-1 excretion levels than those with non-proliferative glomerulonephritis (p<0.001). The percentage of patients whose kidney function deteriorated significantly was 39.0% in the high MCP-1 excretion group and 29.9% in the low MCP-1 excretion group. However, after adjustment for confounding variables such as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and proteinuria, there was no significant association between urine MCP-1 concentration and progression to ESKD, (HR=1.75, 95% CI=0.64-4.75, p=0.27).Our findings indicate that progression to end-stage kidney disease in patients with idiopathic glomerulopathies is not associated with urine MCP-1 concentrations at the time of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2020739539,"Monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B) are enzymes of the outer mitochondrial membrane that metabolize biogenic amines. In the adult central nervous system, MAOs have important functions for neurotransmitter homeostasis. Expression of MAO isoforms has been detected in the developing embryo. However, suppression of MAO-B does not induce developmental alterations. In contrast, targeted inhibition and knockdown of MAO-A expression (E7.5-E10.5) caused structural abnormalities in the brain. Here we explored the molecular mechanisms underlying defective brain development induced by MAO-A knockdown during in vitro embryogenesis. The developmental alterations were paralleled by diminished apoptotic activity in the affected neuronal structures. Moreover, dysfunctional MAO-A expression led to elevated levels of embryonic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)), and we found that knockdown of serotonin receptor-6 (5-Htr6) expression or pharmacologic inhibition of 5-Htr6 activity rescued the MAO-A knockdown phenotype and restored apoptotic activity in the developing brain. Our data suggest that excessive 5-Htr6 activation reduces activation of caspase-3 and -9 of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and enhances expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. Moreover, we found that elevated 5-HT levels in MAO-A knockdown embryos coincided with an enhanced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and a reduction of proliferating cell numbers. In summary, our findings suggest that excessive 5-HT in MAO-A-deficient mouse embryos triggers cellular signaling cascades via 5-Htr6, which suppresses developmental apoptosis in the brain and thus induces developmental retardations."
https://openalex.org/W2075942099,"Most bacterial genomes contain different types of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. The ω-ε-ζ proteinaceous type II TA cassette from the streptococcal pSM19035 plasmid is a member of the ε/ζ family, which is commonly found in multiresistance plasmids and chromosomes of various human pathogens. Regulation of type II TA systems relies on the proteolysis of antitoxin proteins. Under normal conditions, the Epsilon antidote neutralizes the Zeta toxin through the formation of a tight complex. In this study, we show, using both in vivo and in vitro analyses, that the ClpXP protease is responsible for Epsilon antitoxin degradation. Using in vivo studies, we examined the stability of the plasmids with active or inactive ω-ε-ζ TA cassettes in B. subtilis mutants that were defective for different proteases. Using in vitro assays, the degradation of purified His6-Epsilon by the His6-LonBs, ClpPBs, and ClpXBs proteases from B. subtilis was analyzed. Additionally, we showed that purified Zeta toxin protects the Epsilon protein from rapid ClpXP-catalyzed degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2095290832,"Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) is the enzyme predominantly responsible for producing active endothelin-1 (ET-1), a mitogenic peptide implicated in the aetiology of a number of diseases, including cancer. Elevated levels of ECE-1 have been observed in a range of malignancies, with high expression conferring poor prognosis and aiding the acquisition of androgen independence in prostate cancer. The mechanisms regulating the expression of ECE-1 in cancer cells are poorly understood, hampering the development of novel therapies targeting the endothelin axis. Here we provide evidence that the expression of ECE-1 is markedly inhibited by its 3'UTR, and that alternative polyadenylation (APA) results in the production of ECE-1 transcripts with truncated 3'UTRs which promote elevated protein expression. Abolition of the ECE-1 APA sites reduced protein expression from a reporter vector in prostate cancer cells, suggesting these sites are functional. This is the first study to identify ECE-1 as a target for APA, a regulatory mechanism aberrantly activated in cancer cells, and provides novel information about the mechanisms leading to ECE-1 overexpression in malignant cells."
https://openalex.org/W2048643624,"In our previous studies, peripheral blood lineage−CD34+CD31+ cells (CD31+ IMC) appearing in severely burned patients have been characterized as inhibitor cells for the production of β-defensins (HBDs) by human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK). In this study, the effect of glycyrrhizin on pseudomonal skin infections was studied in a chimera model of thermal injury. Two different chimera models were utilized. Patient chimeras were created in murine antimicrobial peptide-depleted NOD-SCID IL-2rγnull mice that were grafted with unburned skin tissues of severely burned patients and inoculated with the same patient peripheral blood CD31+ IMC. Patient chimera substitutes were created in the same mice that were grafted with NHEK and inoculated with experimentally induced CD31+ IMC. In the results, both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin resisted a 20 LD50 dose of P. aeruginosa skin infection, while all chimeras in both groups treated with saline died within 3 days of the infection. Human antimicrobial peptides were detected from the grafted site tissues of both groups of chimeras treated with glycyrrhizin, while the peptides were not detected in the same area tissues of controls. HBD-1 was produced by keratinocytes in transwell-cultures performed with CD31+ IMC and glycyrrhizin. Also, inhibitors (IL-10 and CCL2) of HBD-1 production by keratinocytes were not detected in cultures of patient CD31+ IMC treated with glycyrrhizin. These results indicate that sepsis stemming from pseudomonal grafted site infections in a chimera model of burn injury is controllable by glycyrrhizin. Impaired antimicrobial peptide production at the infection site of severely burned patients may be restored after treatment with glycyrrhizin."
https://openalex.org/W2071545216,"A previous study from our laboratory reported a preferential conservation of arginine relative to lysine in the C-terminal tail (CTT) of HIV-1 envelope (Env). Despite substantial overall sequence variation in the CTT, specific arginines are highly conserved in the lentivirus lytic peptide (LLP) motifs and are scarcely substituted by lysines, in contrast to gp120 and the ectodomain of gp41. However, to date, no explanation has been provided to explain the selective incorporation and conservation of arginines over lysines in these motifs. Herein, we address the functions in virus replication of the most conserved arginines by performing conservative mutations of arginine to lysine in the LLP1 and LLP2 motifs. The presence of lysine in place of arginine in the LLP1 motif resulted in significant impairment of Env expression and consequently virus replication kinetics, Env fusogenicity, and incorporation. By contrast, lysine exchanges in LLP2 only affected the level of Env incorporation and fusogenicity. Our findings demonstrate that the conservative lysine substitutions significantly affect Env functional properties indicating a unique functional role for the highly conserved arginines in the LLP motifs. These results provide for the first time a functional explanation to the preferred incorporation of arginine, relative to lysine, in the CTT of HIV-1 Env. We propose that these arginines may provide unique functions for Env interaction with viral or cellular cofactors that then influence overall Env functional properties."
https://openalex.org/W2124723918,"Whole genome pathway analysis is a powerful tool for the exploration of the combined effects of gene-sets within biological pathways. This study applied Interval Based Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) to perform whole-genome pathway analysis of body-mass index (BMI). We used a discovery set composed of summary statistics from a meta-analysis of 123,865 subjects performed by the GIANT Consortium, and an independent sample of 8,632 subjects to assess replication of significant pathways. We examined SNPs within nominally significant pathways using linear mixed models to estimate their contribution to overall BMI heritability. Six pathways replicated as having significant enrichment for association after correcting for multiple testing, including the previously unknown relationships between BMI and the Reactome regulation of ornithine decarboxylase pathway, the KEGG lysosome pathway, and the Reactome stabilization of P53 pathway. Two non-overlapping sets of genes emerged from the six significant pathways. The clustering of shared genes based on previously identified protein-protein interactions listed in PubMed and OMIM supported the relatively independent biological effects of these two gene-sets. We estimate that the SNPs located in examined pathways explain ∼20% of the heritability for BMI that is tagged by common SNPs (3.35% of the 16.93% total)."
