https://openalex.org/W2051654117,"The high affinity of the noncovalent interaction between biotin and streptavidin forms the basis for many diagnostic assays that require the formation of an irreversible and specific linkage between biological macromolecules. Comparison of the refined crystal structures of apo and a streptavidin:biotin complex shows that the high affinity results from several factors. These factors include the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between biotin and the protein, together with the ordering of surface polypeptide loops that bury the biotin in the protein interior. Structural alterations at the biotin binding site produce quaternary changes in the streptavidin tetramer. These changes apparently propagate through cooperative deformations in the twisted β sheets that link tetramer subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1975511017,"Recently, a hypothetical structure called a leucine zipper was proposed that defines a new class of DNA binding proteins. The common feature of these proteins is a region spanning approximately 30 amino acids that contains a periodic repeat of leucines every seven residues. A peptide corresponding to the leucine zipper region of the yeast transcriptional activator GCN4 was synthesized and characterized. This peptide associates in the micromolar concentration range to form a very stable dimer of alpha helices with a parallel orientation. Although some features of the leucine zipper model are supported by our experimental data, the peptide has the characteristics of a coiled coil."
https://openalex.org/W2063379973,"A rhesus monkey was trained to move its arm in a direction that was perpendicular to and counterclockwise from the direction of a target light that changed in position from trial to trial. Solution of this problem was hypothesized to involve the creation and mental rotation of an imagined movement vector from the direction of the light to the direction of the movement. This hypothesis was tested directly by recording the activity of cells in the motor cortex during performance of the task and computing the neuronal population vector in successive time intervals during the reaction time. The population vector rotated gradually counterclockwise from the direction of the light to the direction of the movement at an average rate of 732 degrees per second. These results provide direct, neural evidence for the mental rotation hypothesis and indicate that the neuronal population vector is a useful tool for ""reading out"" and identifying cognitive operations of neuronal ensembles."
https://openalex.org/W2086145483,An analysis of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S-like rRNA) from the protozoan Giardia lamblia provided a new perspective on the evolution of nucleated cells. Evolutionary distances estimated from sequence comparisons between the 16S-like rRNAs of Giardia lamblia and other eukaryotes exceed similar estimates of evolutionary diversity between archaebacteria and eubacteria and challenge the phylogenetic significance of multiple eukaryotic kingdoms. The Giardia lamblia 16S-like rRNA has retained many of the features that may have been present in the common ancestor of eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
https://openalex.org/W2011669749,"Adrenalectomy of adult male rats resulted in a nearly complete loss of hippocampal granule cells 3 to 4 months after surgery. Nissl and immunocytochemical staining of hippocampal neurons revealed that the granule cell loss was selective; there was no apparent loss of hippocampal pyramidal cells or of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)-, somatostatin-, neuropeptide Y-, calcium binding protein-, or parvalbumin-containing hippocampal interneurons. The hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of adrenalectomized animals exhibited normal electrophysiological responses to afferent stimulation, whereas responses evoked in the dentate gyrus were severely attenuated. Corticosterone replacement prevented both the adrenalectomy-induced granule cell loss and the attenuated physiological response. Thus, the adrenal glands play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of the normal adult brain."
https://openalex.org/W1562797648,"Incubation of NAD+ with extracts from sea urchin eggs resulted in production of a metabolite which could mobilize intracellular Ca2+ stores of the eggs. In this study we present structural evidence indicating that the metabolite is a cyclized ADP-ribose having an N-glycosyl linkage between the anomeric carbon of the terminal ribose unit and the N6-amino group of the adenine moiety. In view of this structure we propose cyclic ADP-ribose as the common name for the metabolite. The purification procedure for the metabolite consisted of deproteinizing the incubated egg extracts and sequentially chromatographing the extracts through three different high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) columns. The homogeneity of the purified metabolite was further verified by HPLC on a Partisil 5 SAX column. Using radioactive precursor NAD+ with label at various positions it was demonstrated that the metabolite was indeed derived from NAD+ and that the adenine ring as well as the adenylate α-phosphate were retained in the metabolite whereas the nicotinamide group was removed. This was confirmed by 1H NMR and two-dimensional COSY experiments, which also allowed the identification of all 12 protons on the two ribosyl units as well as the two protons on the adenine ring. From the chemical shifts of the two anomeric protons it was concluded that the C-1 carbons of both ribosyl units were still bonded to nitrogen. The positive and negative ion fast atom bombardment mass spectra showed (M + Na)+, (M − H + 2Na)+, (M − H)−, and (M − 2H + Na)− peaks at m/z 564, 586, 540, and 562, respectively. Exact mass measurements indicated a molecular weight of 540.0526 for (M − H)−. This together with the constraints imposed by the results from NMR, radioactive labeling, and total phosphate determination uniquely specified a molecular composition of C15H21N5O13P2. Analysis by 1H NMR and mass spectroscopy of the only major breakdown product of the metabolite after prolonged incubation at room temperature established that it was ADP-ribose, thus providing strong support for the cyclic structure."
https://openalex.org/W2168837119,"DNA and nuclear proteins were transferred into cells simultaneously at more than 95% efficiency by means of vesicle complexes. The DNA was rapidly transported into the nuclei of cultured cells, and its expression reached a maximum within 6 to 8 hours after its introduction. Moreover, when the plasmid DNA and nuclear protein were cointroduced into nondividing cells in rat liver by injection into the portal veins of adult rats, the plasmid DNA was carried into liver cell nuclei efficiently by nuclear protein. The expression of the DNA in adult rat liver, on introduction of the DNA with nuclear protein, was more than five times as great as with nonnuclear protein."
https://openalex.org/W2019005479,"Knowledge of three-dimensional protein structures is one of the foundations of protein design and protein engineering. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy was recently introduced as a second method for protein structure determination, in addition to the well-established diffraction techniques with protein single crystals. This new approach enables one to carry out detailed structural studies of proteins in solution and other noncrystalline states, which may be similar or identical to the physiological environment, and promises new insights into the dynamics of protein molecules and the protein-folding problem."
https://openalex.org/W1991502013,"The deletion mutation in the HPRT-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line E14TG2a has been corrected by gene targeting. The presence of plasmid sequences in the correcting vector DNA did not affect the frequency of correction. We have characterized three different HPRT gene structures in correctants. Cells from one corrected clone have been introduced into mouse blastocysts, and germ line transmission of the ES cell-derived corrected gene has been achieved. The corrected gene has the same pattern of expression as the wild-type gene, with the characteristic elevated level of expression in brain tissue. Hence, we have demonstrated the feasibility of introducing targeted modifications into the mouse germ line by homologous recombination in ES cells."

https://openalex.org/W2004413158,"Because chromosomal homologues segregate from one another during meiosis, spermatids are genetically different. Post-meiotic gene expression could lead to gametic differences, some of which might lead to preferential transmission of certain alleles over others. In both insects and mammals, however, all the cells derived from a single spermatogonial cell develop within a common syncytium formed as a result of incomplete cytokinesis at each of the mitotic and meiotic cell divisions1–3. It has been proposed that the intercellular bridges connecting the cells, which are about 1 μm in diameter4, permit the sharing of cytoplasmic constituents, thus ensuring the synchronous development of a clone of cells and gametic equivalence between haploid spermatids2,5,6. By analysing the product of a transgene which is expressed exclusively in post-meiotic germ cells in hemizygous transgenic mice, we have shown that genetically distinct spermatids share the product of the trans-gene and hence can be phenotypically equivalent."
https://openalex.org/W2014395811,"Individual DNA molecules undergoing agarose gel electrophoresis were viewed with the aid of a fluorescence microscope. Molecular shape and orientation were studied in both steady and pulsed electric fields. It was observed that (i) DNA macromolecules advanced lengthwise through the gel in an extended configuration, (ii) the molecules alternately contracted and lengthened as they moved, (iii) the molecules often became hooked around obstacles in a U-shape for extended periods, and (iv) the molecules displayed elasticity as they extended from both ends at once. A computer model has been developed that simulates the migration of the molecules in a rotating-field gel electrophoresis experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2004718563,"Antigen (egg albumin) injections, which stimulate mucosal mast cells to secrete mediators, were paired with an audiovisual cue. After reexposure to the audiovisual cue, a mediator (rat mast cell protease II) was measured with a sensitive and specific assay. Animals reexposed to only the audiovisual cue released a quantity of protease not significantly different from animals reexposed to both the cue and the antigen; these groups released significantly more protease than animals that had received the cue and antigen in a noncontingent manner. The results support a role for the central nervous system as a functional effector of mast cell function in the allergic state."

https://openalex.org/W2061895065,"Human and murine mononuclear phagocytes express a high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin G that plays a central role in macrophage antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and clearance of immune complexes. The receptor (FcRI) may also be involved in CD4-independent infection of human macrophages by human immunodeficiency virus. This report describes the isolation of cDNA clones encoding the human FcRI by a ligand-mediated selection technique. Expression of the cDNAs in COS cells gave rise to immunoglobulin G binding of the expected affinity and subtype specificity. RNA blot analysis revealed expression of a 1.7-kilobase transcript in macrophages and in cells of the promonocytic cell line U937 induced with interferon-gamma. The extracellular region of FcRI consists of three immunoglobulin-like domains, two of which share homology with low-affinity receptor domains."
https://openalex.org/W2059480152,"A 435-kilobase (kb) DNA segment, which is centromeric to HLA-B in the human major histocompatibility complex, was isolated by chromosome walking with overlapping cosmids. Within the cloned region, the genes for the tumor necrosis factors (TNFs) alpha and beta and HLA-B were 210 kb apart. The human homolog of a mouse gene, B144, was located next to TNF alpha. Moreover, the presence of additional genes was suggested by a large cluster of CpG islands. With cosmid probes, several distinct transcripts were detected in RNA samples from a variety of cell lines. Altogether, five novel genes were identified by isolation of corresponding complementary DNA clones. These ""HLA-B-associated transcripts"" (BATs) were mapped to different locations within a 160-kb region that includes the genes for TNF alpha and TNF beta. The presence of the genes for BAT1 and BAT5 in the vicinity of HLA-B again raises the question of which gene in this region determines susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis."
https://openalex.org/W2031596923,"The relation between terminal mitosis and the events that determine the developmental fate of embryonic precursor cells is not well understood. This relation has now been investigated with [3H]thymidine autoradiography to determine the time of cell birth and with a culture system that allows the testing of the developmental potential of cells isolated from the chick embryo retina. Contrary to the situation in vivo, where neuronal differentiation always precedes photoreceptor differentiation, photoreceptor differentiation occurs prematurely and precedes neuronal differentiation when precursor cells are isolated from the retina at early embryonic stages. Thus, cells born by embryonic day 5 (ED-5) give rise predominantly to photoreceptors when isolated for culture on ED-6 but develop mainly as neurons when isolated on ED-8. This suggests that retinal precursor cells retain after terminal mitosis the capacity to develop either as neurons or as photoreceptors. Moreover, photoreceptor differentiation appears to represent a constitutive or ""default"" pathway that precursor cells follow in the absence of neuron-inducing signals."

https://openalex.org/W1991687023,Uncoated double-stranded DNA dissolved in a salt solution was deposited on graphite and imaged in air with the scanning tunneling microscope (STM). The resolution was such that the major and minor grooves could be distinguished. The pitch of the helix varied between 27 and 63 angstroms in the images obtained. Thus the STM can be useful for structural studies of a variety of uncoated and isolated biomolecules.
https://openalex.org/W2086587007,"The prevalence and patterns of same-gender sexual contact among men are key components of models of the spread of HIV infection and AIDS in the U.S. population. Previous estimates by Kinsey et al. from data collected between 1938 and 1948 have been widely criticized for inadequacies of sample design. New lower-bound estimates of prevalence developed from data from a national sample survey conducted in 1970 indicate that minimums of 20.3 percent of adult men in the United States in 1970 had sexual contact to orgasm with another man at some time in life; 6.7 percent had such contact after age 19; and between 1.6 and 2.0 percent had such contact within the previous year. Although these estimates incorporate adjustments for missing data, the likelihood of underreporting suggests that these estimates might be lower bounds on the prevalence of same-gender sex among men. Two sets of alternative estimates are derived to assess the sensitivity of these estimates to the assumptions made in imputing values to missing data. Detailed estimates are presented by frequency of contact, age, education, and marital status; and supporting estimates are derived from a 1988 national survey. Data from both the 1970 and 1988 surveys indicate that never-married men are more likely than other men to have had same-gender sexual contacts within the last year. The 1970 survey also indicates, however, that approximately half the men estimated to have such contacts are found among the more numerous population of currently or previously married men."

Two experiments explored the sensitivity of preschool children to intentional events that can be stated in terms of time and distance only. In habituation-dishabituation of attention tests, preschool children differentiated between intentional movement patterns of two balls and the nonintentional control events where the movements were desynchronized. Also, reversal of the roles of the balls produced more recovery of attention in the intentional case than it did in the nonintentional case."

Although sorting is generally assumed to be accomplished by specific carriers, the nature of these carriers remains elusive. In this study, peptide hormones were used as affinity ligands to purify a set of 25-kilodalton proteins from canine pancreatic tissue. Their ligand specificities and patterns of expression have the characteristics of sorting carriers."

https://openalex.org/W1605324556,"Abstract 12-O-Tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates the release of free choline from intact NG108-15 cells into the medium, without affecting the release of phosphocholine (Liscovitch, M., Blusztajn, J.K., Freese, A., and Wurtman, R.J. (1987) Biochem. J. 241, 81-86). To test the hypothesis that this response reflects activation of cellular phospholipase D, via protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme), I examined in NG108-15 cells the biosynthesis of the abnormal phospholipid phosphatidylethanol, produced by phospholipase D in the presence of ethanol by transphosphatidylation. Phosphatidylethanol production was quantitated by measuring the incorporation of phosphatidyl moieties (prelabeled metabolically with [3H]oleic acid) into phosphatidylethanol. The production of phosphatidylethanol in NG108-15 cells was virtually dependent on stimulation by TPA, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 18 nM). The rate of 3H-phosphatidylethanol formation reached a peak after 10 min of incubation with TPA and declined gradually thereafter. The levels of 3H-phosphatidylethanol in TPA-treated cells were directly related to ethanol concentration in the physiologically attainable range (20-80 mM). Phosphatidylethanol production was activated only by phorbol derivatives that are activators of protein kinase C (i.e. TPA, 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate, and 4 beta-phorbol-12,13-didecanoate) and could be mimicked by a cell-permeant diacylglycerol, 1,2-dioctanoyl-sn-glycerol, in a nonadditive manner. The effect of TPA was inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (0.1 mM) by 70% but not by N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide. Phosphatidylethanol formation was completely abolished in cells in which protein kinase C was down-regulated by pretreatment of the cells with TPA. These results indicate that phosphatidylethanol biosynthesis in NG108-15 cells depends largely on activation of protein kinase C. In contrast to its effects on the release of free choline and on the accumulation of phosphatidylethanol, TPA did not affect the levels of phosphatidic acid in NG108-15 cells. It is therefore proposed that protein kinase C selectively activates the phosphatidyl transferase activity of phospholipase D, reflecting a signal termination mechanism which may be operative in phospholipase D-mediated signal transduction cascades."
https://openalex.org/W1499552262,"Treatment of leukemic HL-60, NIH 3T3, and baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells, prelabeled with [2-14C]ethanolamine, with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a potent activator of protein kinase C, resulted in increased degradation of both 14C-labeled phosphatidylethanolamine and its alkenyl (plasmalogen) derivate. A half-maximal and a maximal (approximately 3.4-fold) stimulation of ethanolamine phospholipid degradation required 3 and 10-20 nM TPA, respectively. TPA had a similar concentration-dependent stimulatory effect on the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine in cells previously prelabeled with [methyl-14C]choline. Increased phospholipid degradation was not accompanied by the formation of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that a phospholipase A-type enzyme was not involved. About 80% of total water-soluble degradation products was ethanolamine, suggesting that phospholipid hydrolysis was catalyzed by a phospholipase D-type enzyme. Increased formation of ethanolamine with exposure of cells to TPA was observed only after a 10-min lag period. Mezerein, bryostatin, sn-1-oleoyl-2-acetylglycerol, and polymyxin B, all of which mimic the action of TPA on protein phosphorylation in vivo, also stimulated the hydrolysis of ethanolamine phospholipids in HL-60 cells, suggesting that the TPA effect was mediated by protein kinase C."
https://openalex.org/W2031956348,"By virtue of its immediate contact with the circulating blood, the endothelium provides an attractive target for retroviral vector transduction for the purpose of gene therapy. To see whether efficient gene transfer and expression was feasible, rabbit aortic endothelial cells were infected with three Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vectors. Two of these vectors carry genes encoding products that are not secreted: N2, containing only the selectable marker gene neoR, and SAX, containing both neoR gene and an SV40-promoted adenosine deaminase (ADA) gene. The third vector, G2N, contains a secretory rat growth hormone (rGH) gene and an SV40-promoted neoR gene. Infection with all three vectors resulted in expression of the respective genes. A high level of human ADA expression was observed in infected endothelial cell populations both before and after selection in G418. G2N-infected rabbit aortic endothelial cells that were grown on a synthetic vascular graft continued to secrete rGH into the culture medium. These studies suggest that endothelial cells may serve as vehicles for the introduction in vivo of functioning recombinant genes."
https://openalex.org/W1995430086,"The c-myc protooncogene in mouse embryos was shown by RNA in situ hybridization to be preferentially expressed in tissues of endodermal and mesodermal origin. Most organs developing from the ectoderm, such as skin, brain, and spinal cord, displayed low levels of c-myc RNA. The thymus represented the only hematopoietic organ with high c-myc expression. In organs and structures strongly hybridizing to c-myc probes, for example the fetal part of the placenta, gut, liver, kidney, pancreas, submandibular glands, enamel organs of the molars, and skeletal cartilage, the level of expression depended on the stage of development. Expression was observed to be correlated with proliferation, particularly during expansion and folding of partially differentiated epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1572939664,"The glycosaminoglycan heparin inhibits the growth of several cell types in vitro including smooth muscle cells and rat cervical epithelial cells. The commercially available heparin which has antiproliferative activity is a structurally heterogeneous polymer that undergoes extensive modifications during maturation. In this report we have performed structure-function studies on heparin's antiproliferative activity using three different cell types: both rat and calf vascular aortic smooth muscle cells and rat cervical epithelial cells. The minimal oligosaccharide size requirements for antiproliferative activity were determined for the three cell types by using oligosaccharide fragments of defined length prepared by nitrous acid cleavage and gel filtration and a synthetic pentasaccharide. The size requirements are similar but not identical for the different cell types. Hexasaccharide fragments are antiproliferative for all three cell types but the synthetic pentasaccharide inhibits the growth of only the rat and calf vascular aortic smooth muscle cells. The interdependence between size and charge for antiproliferative activity was investigated using chemically modified oligosaccharides as well as oligosaccharides prepared from heparin and separated into fractions of differing charge by ion-exchange chromatography. There is a strong interdependence between size and charge for antiproliferative activity. For example, increasing the charge of inactive tetrasaccharide fragments by O-oversulfation makes them antiproliferative whereas reducing the charge of active larger fragments causes them to loose their antiproliferative activity. Finally the importance of 2-O-sulfate glucuronic acid moieties for antiproliferative activity was investigated using heparin preparations that lack 2-O-sulfate glucuronic acid. These compounds possess antiproliferative activity indicating that 2-O-sulfate glucuronic acid is not required for antiproliferative activity."
https://openalex.org/W2080929609,"Vision in most vertebrates is an active process that requires the brain to combine retinal signals with information about eye movement. Eye movement information may feed forward from the motor control areas of the brain or feed back from the extrinsic eye muscles. Feedback signals elicited by passive eye movement selectively gate retinal outflow at the first relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The gating predominantly facilitates retinogeniculate transmission immediately after eye movement and inhibits transmission when a new steady-state eye position is achieved. These two gating effects are distributed in a complementary fashion across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus such that the spatiotemporal activity profile could contribute to object detection and localization."
https://openalex.org/W1608919536,"Abstract A derivative of ganglioside GT1b (IV3NeuAc,II3(NeuAc)2-GgOse4) with an active ester in its lipid portion was synthesized and covalently attached to bovine serum albumin (BSA). The conjugate, having four GT1b molecules per albumin molecule [GT1b)4BSA) was radioiodinated and used to probe rat brain membranes for ganglioside binding proteins. A ganglioside-specific, high affinity (KD = 2-4 nM), saturable (Bmax = 13-20 pmol/mg membrane protein) binding site for 125I-(GT1b)4BSA was demonstrated on detergent-solubilized rat brain membranes adsorbed to filters. 125I-(GT1b)4BSA binding was tissue-specific (more than 35-fold greater to brain than to liver membranes) and was nearly eliminated by pretreatment of brain membrane-adsorbed filters with trypsin (1 microgram/ml). Underivatized gangliosides added as mixed detergent-lipid micelles blocked 125I-(GT1b)4BSA binding to brain membranes; structurally related GQ1b, GT1b, and GD1b were the most potent (half-maximal inhibition at 70-110 nM), while half-maximal inhibition by other gangliosides (GD3, GD1a, GM3, GM2, and GM1) required 5-20-fold higher concentrations. Other sphingolipids, neutral glycosphingolipids, and glycoproteins were poor inhibitors, and treatment of (GT1b)4BSA with neuraminidase attenuated its binding. Although most phospholipids were noninhibitory, phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol inhibited half-maximally at 400-600 nM. However, inhibition of 125I-(GT1b)4BSA binding by gangliosides was competitive and reversible while that by phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylglycerol was not. Ganglioside-protein conjugate binding reveals ganglioside-specific brain membrane receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2079667369,"Follicle rupture during ovulation is associated with inflammation-like changes. Because platelet activating factor (PAF) participates in the inflammatory process, the effect of a PAF-specific antagonist, BN52021, on the ovulatory response was tested in rats. BN52021, administered locally, inhibited follicle rupture in rats stimulated to ovulate with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In addition to suppressing rupture of the follicles, this antagonist suppressed the hCG-stimulated increase in ovarian collagenolysis and vascular permeability. The inhibition of ovulation of BN52021 could be reversed by simultaneous administration of PAF. Furthermore, PAF partially reversed the blockage of ovulation by inhibitors of eicosanoid synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest the involvement of PAF in ovulation. Its role seems to be closely related to the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Thus, modulation of PAF action may serve as an additional target for regulation of reproduction via its action on ovulation."
https://openalex.org/W2023072209,"The bont tick, Amblyomma hebraeum, is the principal vector to southern African ruminants of heartwater (Cowdria ruminantium infection). The role of feeding male ticks, which emit an aggregation-attachment pheromone, in attracting unfed ticks to cattle was investigated. Calves infested with feeding male ticks were more attractive to unfed adult ticks than were uninfested calves. The presence of the pheromone on previously infested cattle apparently allows unfed ticks to discriminate between hosts on which these parasites have fed successfully (suitable hosts) and those on which they have not (potentially unsuitable hosts). The use of acaricides is thus unlikely to reduce bont tick populations in areas where adequate numbers of alternate (wild) hosts are present. Also, cattle so treated may lose their resistance to heartwater through lessened exposure to infected ticks."
https://openalex.org/W1542242159,"Hens of the Restricted Ovulator (R/O) chicken strain are characterized by the absence of egg-laying and concomitant severe hyperlipidemia due to a single gene defect (Ho, K. J., Lawrence, W. D., Lewis, L. A., Liu, L. B., and Taylor, C. B. (1974) Arch. Pathol. 98, 161-172). However, the underlying biochemical defect has not been identified. Previous studies on receptor-mediated growth of chicken oocytes have led to the characterization of a 95-kDa oocyte plasma membrane receptor that binds very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) (George, R., Barber, D. L., and Schneider, W. J. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16838-16847). The current experiments demonstrate the absence of this receptor from R/O oocytes. Ligand binding experiments showed that ovarian membranes from mutant hens failed to display high affinity, saturable, and specific binding of 125I-VLDL. Ligand blotting with 125I-VLDL and Western blotting with polyclonal anti-receptor antibodies visualized the 95-kDa receptor in normal oocytes, but R/O ovarian membranes were devoid of any cross-reactive protein. Finally, plasma clearance of intravenously injected 125I-VLDL was dramatically impaired in R/O in comparison to normal hens, with a concomitant decrease in the radioactivity accumulating in R/O oocytes. These data strongly suggest that the absence of the 95-kDa receptor for VLDL from oocytes is responsible for the R/O phenotype, and that the receptor not only binds VLDL, but also mediates its uptake. This animal model provides a powerful tool for investigations of receptor-mediated growth of chicken oocytes and for the elucidation of regulatory mechanisms in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism of laying hens."
https://openalex.org/W1529241857,"Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometric analyses were performed on enzymatically derived oligosaccharides from the acidic excreted polysaccharides (EPS) from representative bacterial strains of the pea-nodulating symbiont, Rhizobium leguminosarum (128C53, 128C63, and 300) and the clover-nodulating symbiont, Rhizobium trifolii (NA-30, ANU843, 0403, TA-1, LPR5035, USDA20.102, and 4S). The results revealed structural similarities and differences between EPS of these two species. Octasaccharide units containing galactose, glucuronic acid, alpha-L-threo-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid, and glucose in a molar ratio of 1:1:1:5 were obtained from the EPS of the three R. leguminosarum strains and had the same primary glycosyl sequence and location of pyruvate, acetate, and 3-hydroxybutyrate substituents. About 80% of the galactose residues were acylated with 3-hydroxybutyrate, and there were two acetyl groups per repeating unit distributed between the 2 glucose residues of the main chain-derived sequence of the octasaccharides. In contrast, the R. trifolii strains had varied EPS structures, each of which differed from the common R. leguminosarum EPS structure. The EPS from one group of R. trifolii strains (0403 and LPR5035) most closely resembled the R. leguminosarum EPS but differed in that a lower number of galactose and glucose residues were substituted by 3-hydroxybutyryl and acetyl groups, respectively. The EPS from a second group of R. trifolii strains (ANU843, TA-1, and NA-30) was even more different than the R. leguminosarum EPS. These R. trifolii octasaccharides bore a single acetyl group on O-3 of the glucuronic acid residue. In addition, the level of acylation by 3-hydroxybutyryl groups was 50% of that present in the R. leguminosarum EPS. The remaining two strains of R. trifolii (USDA20.102 and 4S) had very different patterns of acylation to each other and to all of the other strains. The EPS from strain USDA20.102 practically lacked 3-hydroxybutyryl groups and had a unique degree and pattern of acetylation. The oligomers from the EPS of R. trifolii strain 4S completely lacked 3-hydroxybutyryl groups and galactose. The latter EPS contained only one O-1-carboxyethylidene group and had a different degree and pattern of acetylation. Interestingly, these two latter strains differ from the other R. trifolii strains in nodulation rates on rare clover species in the Trifolium cross-inoculation group. Thus, we define several groups of R. trifolii based upon their EPS structures and establish their similarities and distinct differences with the EPS of R. leguminosarum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

Application of a deuterium isotope effect of 2.8 led to rate constants in H2O for kC of 0.092 min-1 and kD of 0.73 min-1. The equilibrium concentration of IA and rates for kC and kD are then used to explain the lag phase in the inhibition of cathepsin B and papain by leupeptin. Two circumstances are observed. (i) At micromolar concentrations of leupeptin and papain the binding of leupeptin is biphasic with rate constants identical to kD and kC. (ii) At more dilute nanomolar concentrations of total leupeptin and proteases, the observed lag phase for approach to steady-state inhibition (with rate constant k') is now explained by the low values of the koff rate constants (0.072 min-1 for cathepsin B and 0.024 min-1 for papain) together with the extremely low concentrations of the active inhibitor form IA, with k' = kon[IA] + koff. While kon[IA] is slow, the second-order rate constant kon is found to be quite fast, 1.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for cathepsin B and 1.8 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 for papain. Thus, the binding of leupeptin to cathepsin B and papain may show a lag phase, but this is not due to slow binding."
https://openalex.org/W1553960133,"Hemoglobin binds to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3 protein (CDB3) at physiologic pH and ionic strength in an oxygen-linked fashion, with deoxyhemoglobin having the higher affinity. The evidence in the literature suggests functional communication between the hemoglobin-binding site on CDB3 and the anion transport sites within the membrane-bound domain of band 3. Since the hemoglobin-binding site is estimated to be over 200 A from the transport domain, the functional communication hypothesis would require the existence of long-range, global changes in the CDB3 dimeric quaternary structure consequent to hemoglobin binding. In this report sulfhydryl reactivity toward p-mercuribenzoate is studied in an attempt to identify such long-range conformational changes. Formation of stoichiometric hemoglobin/CDB3 complexes is shown to produce major changes in sulfhydryl reactivity. Since the sulfhydryl pocket of CDB3 is known to lie at the dimeric interface over 100 A from the hemoglobin-binding site, the observed changes in reactivity suggest that hemoglobin complexation induces a global change in quaternary structure of the CDB3 dimer. This change offers a mechanism to explain functional connections between CDB3-binding sites and the anion transport sites on band 3. The existence of such long-range conformational changes would imply that the CDB3 dimer is poised to function as a cytosolic arm or lever in order to modulate the global structure of the porter."
https://openalex.org/W1585690069,"Troponin I is the actomyosin ATPase inhibitory subunit present in the thin filament regulatory complex. The complete amino acid sequence of crayfish tail muscle troponin I has been determined. The protein is composed of 201 amino acid residues and has a molecular weight of 23,547. The N terminus is blocked, likely by an acetyl group. Crayfish troponin I shows a rather low (20–25%) sequence identity with vertebrate troponin Is as compared to the 60–82% identity within the vertebrate phylum. Similar to vertebrate cardiac troponin I, crayfish troponin I contains a 30-residue-long N-terminal extension. In crayfish troponin I, this segment bears significant sequence homology with the heavy or light chains of particular myosins. The actin-binding domain of crayfish troponin I, which displays 57% sequence homology with vertebrate troponin Is, possesses 2 unusual trimethyllysine residues. The consensus sequence of this domain in five troponin Is is as follows: D-L-R-G-K-F-X-R*-P-X-L-R*-R*-V, where R+ stands for Arg/Lys, R* for Arg/trimethyllysine, and X for any amino acid residue. Troponin I possesses two Ca2+-dependent interactive sites for troponin C; one partly overlaps with the actin binding domain and is highly conserved, and the other, corresponding to the 30-residue-long segment following the N-terminal extension in vertebrate cardiac and crayfish troponin I, is poorly conserved in the different troponin Is. Troponin I also interacts with troponin T. The consensus sequence for the interacting site on troponin I is as follows: h-D−-X-D−-R+-Y-D-h-E-h, where h stands for a hydrophobic residue, D− for Asp/Glu, R+ for Arg/Lys, and X for any residue. The five troponin Is further possess one more 15-residue-long segment of high sequence identity near the C terminus. Its evolutionary conservation suggests that this domain is involved in protein-protein interaction."
https://openalex.org/W1526858212,"Unfertilized eggs of Plecoglossus altivelis (a kind of freshwater trout, Ayu in Japanese) were found to contain a relatively large pool of three sialooligosaccharides. These free oligosaccharides were accumulated in the cytoplasm up to concentrations of about 35 ng per egg, which correspond to about 107 micrograms/g. Their structures were determined by a combination of chemical (composition and methylation analysis and Smith degradation) and instrumental (fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, secondary ion mass spectrometry, and 400-MHz1H NMR) analyses. The structures established represent a typical type of bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary sialooligosaccharides all of which end with di-N-acetylchitobiose structure (-GlcNAc beta 1-4GlcNAc) and alpha -2,3-linked NeuAc at reducing and nonreducing termini, respectively. These data show that these free sialooligosaccharides, which were originally protein-linked components, must be released during oogenesis. Although a specific functional requirement for their release is not known, the occurrence of such free sialooligosaccharides in normal animal cells or tissues has not been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1539954639,"Corneal explants with scleral rims were freshly prepared from day 18 chicken embryos and incubated in vitro for 3 h in the presence of various radioactive precursors. Radiolabeled proteoglycans were isolated from the stromal tissue and culture medium for analysis. Two predominant proteoglycans were identified in corneal stroma. One contains dermatan sulfate and the other contains keratan sulfate; a structural analysis of each is reported in the accompanying paper (Midura, R.J., and Hascall, V.C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 1423-1430). A minor keratan sulfate proteoglycan distinct from the major form, a small amount of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, and some sulfated glycoproteins were also detected in stromal extracts. The biosynthesis of the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan was stable in vitro and in ovo, whereas that of the major keratan sulfate proteoglycan was stable only in ovo. Various treatments were tried to maintain a high rate of keratan sulfate synthesis with time in culture. Cooling the corneal explants to 5 degrees C was the only treatment that reduced this decline in keratan sulfate synthesis in vitro to any significant extent. Three major proteoglycans were observed in the culture medium. Two were dermatan sulfate proteoglycan and appeared to be mainly derived from the scleral tissue surrounding the corneal explant. The third proteoglycan contained keratan sulfate. It was smaller in size and lower in charge density compared to the keratan sulfate proteoglycan found in the stroma, but both appeared to have similar core protein sizes. It seems likely that this proteoglycan was synthesized in the stroma and secreted into the medium. A small amount of heparan sulfate proteoglycan and some sulfated glycoproteins were also detected in the medium."
https://openalex.org/W1548008152,"An azidoquinone derivative, 3-azido-2-methyl-5-methoxy-6-(3,7-dimethyl[3H]octyl)-1,4-benzoquinone (azido-Q), was used to study the plastoquinone-protein interaction and to identify the plastoquinone-binding protein in the cytochrome b6-f complex from spinach chloroplasts. When the lipid- and plastoquinone-deficient cytochrome b6-f complex is incubated with varying concentrations of azido-Q and illuminated with long wavelength UV light for 7 min at 2 degrees C, the enzymatic activity, assayed after reconstitution with lipid, decreases as the concentration of azido-Q increases. Maximum inactivation (45%) is observed when 30 mol of azido-Q is used per mol of cytochrome f. The extent of the decrease in activity upon illumination correlates with the amount of azido-Q incorporated into the protein. The 50% inactivation is in good agreement with that expected based on the amount of plastoquinone deficiency of the isolated enzyme complex. When the photolyzed, [3H]azido-Q-treated sample is extracted with organic solvent and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, radioactivity is found primarily in the Mr = 17,000 subunit. When the enzyme is pretreated with the electron transfer inhibitor 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone or 5-n-undecyl-6-hydroxy-4,7-dioxobenzothiazole, significantly less radioactive label is observed in the Mr = 17,000 protein, suggesting that the action sites of these inhibitors are the same or near the plastoquinone-binding site. When the deficient complex is reconstituted with glycolipid prior to the addition of azido-Q, less than 5% inactivation is observed upon photolysis, and the amount of radioactive label on the Mr = 17,000 protein decreases greatly, suggesting that the plastoquinone-binding site is easily masked by glycolipid when endogenous plastoquinone is absent. Plastoquinol-2 apparently competes with azido-Q for the plastoquinone-binding site since it decreases the radioactive label on the Mr = 17,000 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1602266842,"The external spacer region of a nuclear rRNA gene unit of maize was analyzed for binding of nuclear proteins and revealed binding to the promoter region and to the 200-base pair repeat elements upstream of the promoter. The promoter binding site was further characterized by DNase I and exonuclease III foot-printing as well as by gel shift and South-Western experiments, revealing the binding of several proteins. Competition experiments indicate that the protein which interacts with the repeat units also binds to the promoter region. A model for the combined action of both binding regions in the regulation of transcription is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1502173683,"Studies with lactoperoxidase showed that a highly reactive intermediate is produced (on the enzyme) from I- and H2O2 which then diffuses from the enzyme and very rapidly and indiscriminately iodinates any Tyr or peptides containing Tyr which are in the same solution. The evidence supporting these conclusions follows. 1) The rate followed the Michaelis-Menten pattern with I- and H2O2 while the concentration of Tyr peptides had no measurable effect on the rate; 2) the rates of reaction were independent of the type of peptide in which Tyr was located; 3) the amount of iodination which had occurred after the reaction had gone to completion and the amounts of monoiodination and diiodination after completion of the reaction were independent of the peptide type, the pH, the solvent polarity, or the ionic strength; 4) competition for reaction by two very different Tyr peptides depended only on their initial concentrations; and 5) iodination of a large protein occurred through a dialysis membrane. Free Tyr was iodinated at the same rate as Tyr peptides by lactoperoxidase, but monoiodotyrosine and m-fluorotyrosine were iodinated at one-half that rate. The results also showed that one can choose ratios of [peptide] to [H2O2] such that monoiodination is maximized relative to diiodination. It was also found that the iodination capacity of a mixture of I- and H2O2 with lactoperoxidase (when Tyr was absent) was only slowly dissipated. Finally, the results showed that lactoperoxidase can be used to brominate and chlorinate Tyr peptides at a slow rate."
https://openalex.org/W1543976893,"Adrenodoxin, purified from bovine adrenal cortex, was subjected to trypsin cleavage to yield a trypsin-resistant form, designated TT-adrenodoxin. Sequencing with carboxypeptidase Y identified the trypsin cleavage site as Arg-115, while Edman degradation indicated no NH2-terminal cleavage. Native adrenodoxin and TT-adrenodoxin exhibited similar affinity for adrenodoxin reductase as determined in cytochrome c reductase assays. In side chain cleavage assays using cytochrome P-450scc, however, TT-adrenodoxin demonstrated greater activity than adrenodoxin with cholesterol, (22R)-22-hydroxycholesterol, or (20R,22R)-20,22-dihydroxycholesterol as substrate. This enhanced activity is due to increased affinity of TT-adrenodoxin for cytochrome P-450scc; TT-adrenodoxin exhibits a 3.8-fold lower apparent Km for the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. TT-Adrenodoxin was also more effective in coupling with cytochrome P-45011β, exhibiting a 3.5-fold lower apparent Km for the 11 β-hydroxylation of deoxycorticosterone. In the presence of partially saturating cholesterol, TT-adrenodoxin elicited a type I spectral shift with cytochrome P-450scc similar to that induced by adrenodoxin, and spectral titrations showed that oxidized TT-adrenodoxin exhibited a 1.5-fold higher affinity for cytochrome P-450scc. These results establish that COOH-terminal residues 116–128 are not essential for the electron transfer activity of bovine adrenodoxin, and the differential effects of truncation at Arg-115 on interactions with adrenodoxin reductase and cytochromes P-450 suggest that the residues involved in the interactions are not identical."
https://openalex.org/W1513079589,"Abstract Ca2+ is required for the maintenance of high rates of translational initiation in GH3 pituitary cells (Chin, K.-V., Cade, C., Brostrom, C.O., Galuska, E.M., and Brostrom, M.A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16509-16514). Following thermal stress at 46 degrees C or chemical stress from exposure to sodium arsenite or 8-hydroxyquinoline, rates of amino acid incorporation in Ca2+-restored GH3 cells were reduced acutely to those of unstressed, Ca2+-depleted control preparations. Sodium arsenite treatment resulted in loss of ability to accumulate polysomes in response to Ca2+. Stressed cells allowed to recover for 2-8 h either with or without Ca2+ in the medium exhibited comparable, increasing rates of amino acid incorporation and the induction of heat shock proteins (hsp). Abolition of the Ca2+-dependent component of translation was proportional to the intensity of the stress. Mild thermal stress (41 degrees C) resulted in the induction of hsp 68 and the retention of Ca2+-dependent protein synthesis; hsp 68 was synthesized in a Ca2+-dependent manner. After arsenite stress, restoration of the Ca2+ requirement for protein synthesis occurred by 24 h, and was preceded by a transitional period during which polysomes accumulated in response to Ca2+ without concomitant increased rates of incorporation. Responses to stress are proposed to include an acute inhibition of normal protein synthesis involving the destruction of Ca2+-stimulated initiation and a protracted period of recovery involving synthesis of the hsp accompanied by Ca2+-independent amino acid incorporation and slowed peptide chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1480237262,"In a previous paper, we reported the presence of a unique globo-series glycolipid as one of the major neutral glycolipid: Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1' Cer, in the subcloned PC 12h pheochromocytoma cells (Ariga, T., Yu, R. K., Scarsdale, J. N., Suzuki, M., Kuroda, Y., Kitagawa, H., and Miyatake, T. (1988) Biochemistry 27, 5335-5340). Recently we found that the subcloned PC 12h cells accumulated other unusual neutral glycolipids. In order to characterize these glycolipids, PC 12h cells were subcutaneously transplanted into rats. The induced tumor tissue accumulated four minor neutral glycolipids, which were purified by droplet counter-current, Iatrobeads column, and preparative thin-layer chromatographies. These glycolipid structures were determined by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, permethylation study, and sequential degradation with various exoglycosidases to be as follows: A, Fuc alpha 1-2Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1- 4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer; B, GalNAc beta 1-3Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1- 4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer; C, Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1- 4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer; and D, Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1-3Gal alpha 1- 3Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc beta 1-1'Cer.

https://openalex.org/W2109561834,"The biotransformation of heparinase-derived heparin fragments was examined via a combined approach using 35S-labeled heparin fragments as well as unlabeled chemically defined heparin fragments. Rats dosed with either [35S]di-, tetra-, hexa-, or octasaccharide fragments (2 mg/kg body weight, intravenously) excreted 63-69% of the injected radioactivity into the urine within 24 h with two-thirds being excreted during the first 6 h. Gel permeation chromatography of the urinary material shows that the tetra- and octasaccharides have undergone minor (approximately 5%) depolymerization whereas no change was observed for the di- and hexasaccharides. No N-desulfation was demonstrated for any of the substances. The hexa- and octasaccharide metabolites present in the urine 24 h after dosing exhibited the same antifactor Xa activity as that of the injected material. A chemically defined trisulfated disaccharide and a hexasulfated tetrasaccharide were prepared and dosed in a similar manner. Only one metabolite was recovered from animals dosed with disaccharide. This compound was characterized by anion exchange chromatography, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrometry, and mass spectrometry and shown to be identical to the injected disaccharide. Five metabolites were isolated from the urine of rats dosed with the hexasulfated tetrasaccharide. The major metabolite, consisting of at least 65% of the total, was characterized as described for the disaccharide and shown to be identical to the injected compound. The remaining material appeared to be disaccharides and, possibly, a tetrasaccharide conjugate. Taken together, our results show that the heparinase-derived heparin fragments are very resistant to biotransformation compared with heparin and endogenous heparin fragments. These fragments may therefore be useful in defining structure activity relationships in vivo."
