https://openalex.org/W2018045523,"Spatially or chemically isolated functional modules composed of several cellular components and carrying discrete functions are considered fundamental building blocks of cellular organization, but their presence in highly integrated biochemical networks lacks quantitative support. Here, we show that the metabolic networks of 43 distinct organisms are organized into many small, highly connected topologic modules that combine in a hierarchical manner into larger, less cohesive units, with their number and degree of clustering following a power law. Within Escherichia coli, the uncovered hierarchical modularity closely overlaps with known metabolic functions. The identified network architecture may be generic to system-level cellular organization."
https://openalex.org/W2159631596,"The latitudinal gradient of increasing biodiversity from poles to equator is one of the most prominent but least understood features of life on Earth. Here we show that species diversity can be predicted from the biochemical kinetics of metabolism. We first demonstrate that the average energy flux of populations is temperature invariant. We then derive a model that quantitatively predicts how species diversity increases with environmental temperature. Predictions are supported by data for terrestrial, freshwater, and marine taxa along latitudinal and elevational gradients. These results establish a thermodynamic basis for the regulation of species diversity and the organization of ecological communities."

Here, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy of the Hh pathway antagonist cyclopamine in preclinical models of medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Cyclopamine treatment of murine medulloblastoma cells blocked proliferation in vitro and induced changes in gene expression consistent with initiation of neuronal differentiation and loss of neuronal stem cell-like character. This compound also caused regression of murine tumor allografts in vivo and induced rapid death of cells from freshly resected human medulloblastomas, but not from other brain tumors, thus establishing a specific role for Hh pathway activity in medulloblastoma growth."
https://openalex.org/W2051434331,"Synapses, the junctions between nerve cells through which they communicate, are formed by the coordinated assembly and tight attachment of pre- and postsynaptic specializations. We now show that SynCAM is a brain-specific, immunoglobulin domain–containing protein that binds to intracellular PDZ-domain proteins and functions as a homophilic cell adhesion molecule at the synapse. Expression of the isolated cytoplasmic tail of SynCAM in neurons inhibited synapse assembly. Conversely, expression of full-length SynCAM in nonneuronal cells induced synapse formation by cocultured hippocampal neurons with normal release properties. Glutamatergic synaptic transmission was reconstituted in these nonneuronal cells by coexpressing glutamate receptors with SynCAM, which suggests that a single type of adhesion molecule and glutamate receptor are sufficient for a functional postsynaptic response."
https://openalex.org/W2095584325,"Geographic patterns in species richness are mainly based on wide-ranging species because their larger number of distribution records has a disproportionate contribution to the species richness counts. Here we demonstrate how this effect strongly influences our understanding of what determines species richness. Using both conventional and spatial regression models, we show that for sub-Saharan African birds, the apparent role of productivity diminishes with decreasing range size, whereas the significance of topographic heterogeneity increases. The relative importance of geometric constraints from the continental edge is moderate. Our findings highlight the failure of traditional species richness models to account for narrow-ranging species that frequently are also threatened."
https://openalex.org/W2083136425,"We have measured the shear forces between solid surfaces sliding past each other across aqueous salt solutions, at pressures and concentrations typical of naturally occurring systems. In such systems the surface-attached hydration layers keep the compressed surfaces apart as a result of strongly repulsive hydration forces. We find, however, that the bound water molecules retain a shear fluidity characteristic of the bulk liquid, even when compressed down to films 1.0 +/- 0.3 nanometer thick. We attribute this to the ready exchange (as opposed to loss) of water molecules within the hydration layers as they rub past each other under strong compression."
https://openalex.org/W2010827259,"The presence of snow greatly perturbs the composition of near-surface polar air, and the higher concentrations of hydroxyl radicals (OH) observed result in a greater oxidative capacity of the lower atmosphere. Emissions of nitrogen oxides, nitrous acid, light aldehydes, acetone, and molecular halogens have also been detected. Photolysis of nitrate ions contained in the snow appears to play an important role in creating these perturbations. OH formed in the snowpack can oxidize organic matter and halide ions in the snow, producing carbonyl compounds and halogens that are released to the atmosphere or incorporated into snow crystals. These reactions modify the composition of the snow, of the interstitial air, and of the overlying atmosphere. Reconstructing the composition of past atmospheres from ice-core analyses may therefore require complex corrections and modeling for reactive species."
https://openalex.org/W2075964433,"The bacterium Bacillus anthracis causes the death of macrophages, which may allow it to avoid detection by the innate immune system. We found that B. anthracis lethal factor (LF) selectively induces apoptosis of activated macrophages by cleaving the amino-terminal extension of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinases (MKKs) that activate p38 MAPKs. Because macrophages that are deficient in transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) are also sensitive to activation-induced death and p38 is required for expression of certain NF-kappaB target genes, p38 is probably essential for synergistic induction of those NF-kappaB target genes that prevent apoptosis of activated macrophages. This dismantling of the p38 MAPK module represents a strategy used by B. anthracis to paralyze host innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2106206412,"Gold nanoparticles ranging in diameter from 1 to 8 nanometers were prepared on top of silicon wafers in order to study the size dependence of their oxidation behavior when exposed to atomic oxygen. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed a maximum oxidation resistance for ""magic-number"" clusters containing 55 gold atoms. This inertness is not related to electron confinement leading to a size-induced metal-to-insulator transition, but rather seems to be linked to the closed-shell structure of such magic clusters. The result additionally suggests that gold-55 clusters may act as especially effective oxidation catalysts, such as for oxidizing carbon monoxide."
https://openalex.org/W2080941924,"Recent advances in the determination of the mass balance of polar ice sheets show that the Greenland Ice Sheet is losing mass by near-coastal thinning, and that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, with thickening in the west and thinning in the north, is probably thinning overall. The mass imbalance of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is likely to be small, but even its sign cannot yet be determined. Large sectors of ice in southeast Greenland, the Amundsen Sea Embayment of West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula are changing quite rapidly as a result of processes not yet understood."
https://openalex.org/W1981922751,"Learning a language requires both statistical computations to identify words in speech and algebraic-like computations to discover higher level (grammatical) structure. Here we show that these computations can be influenced by subtle cues in the speech signal. After a short familiarization to a continuous speech stream, adult listeners are able to segment it using powerful statistics, but they fail to extract the structural regularities included in the stream even when the familiarization is greatly extended. With the introduction of subliminal segmentation cues, however, these regularities can be rapidly captured."

https://openalex.org/W2056436647,"We tested the significance of a population of lumbar spinothalamic cells for male sexual behavior in rats. These cells are positioned to relay ejaculation-related signals from reproductive organs to the brain, and they express neurokinin-1 receptors. Ablation of these neurons by the selective toxin SSP-saporin resulted in a complete disruption of ejaculatory behavior. In contrast, other components of sexual behavior remained intact. These results suggest that this population of spinothalamic cells plays a pivotal role in generation of ejaculatory behavior and may be part of a spinal ejaculation generator."

We used an atomic mixture of fermionic potassium-40 and bosonic rubidium-87, in which the strong interspecies attraction leads to an instability above a critical number of particles. The observed phenomenon suggests a direction for manipulating fermion-fermion interactions on the route to superfluidity."

https://openalex.org/W1998958945,"Plasma membranes are organized into functional domains both by liquid-ordered packing into “lipid rafts,” structures that resist Triton extraction, and by attachments to underlying cytoskeletal proteins in assemblies called “membrane skeletons.” Although the actin cytoskeleton is implicated in many lipid raft-mediated signaling processes, little is known about the biochemical basis for actin involvement. We show here that a subset of plasma membrane skeleton proteins from bovine neutrophils co-isolates with cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membrane fragments (DRMs) that exhibit a relatively high buoyant density in sucrose (DRM-H;d ∼1.16 g/ml). By using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight and tandem mass spectrometry, we identified 19 major DRM-H proteins. Membrane skeleton proteins include fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin), myosin-IIA, myosin-IG, α-actinin 1, α-actinin 4, vimentin, and the F-actin-binding protein, supervillin. Other DRM-H components include lipid raft-associated integral membrane proteins (stomatin, flotillin 1, and flotillin 2), extracellular surface-bound and glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (IgM, membrane-type 6 matrix metalloproteinase), and intracellular dually acylated signaling proteins (Lyn kinase, Gαi-2). Consistent with cytoskeletal association, most DRM-H-associated flotillin 2, Lyn, and Gαi-2 also resist extraction with 0.1 m octyl glucoside. Supervillin, myosin-IG, and myosin-IIA resist extraction with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, a treatment that removes all detectable actin, suggesting that these cytoskeletal proteins are proximal to the DRM-H bilayer. Binding of supervillin to the DRM-H fragments is confirmed by co-immunoaffinity purification. In spreading neutrophils, supervillin localizes with F-actin in cell extensions and in discrete basal puncta that partially overlap with Gαi staining.

Many of these domains are relatively stable on the cell surface and involve a series of linkages between cytoplasmic cytoskeletal proteins, integral membrane proteins, and extracellular attachments to the substrate or to other cells. For example, intermediate filament anchorages to membranes at desmosomes and hemidesmosomes distribute mechanical stresses over epithelial surfaces and maintain the integrity of skin and other tissues (1Jonkman M.F. J. Dermatol. Sci. 1999; 20: 103-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 2McMillan J.R. Shimizu H. J. Dermatol. (Tokyo). 2001; 28: 291-298Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane domains anchored to actin filaments include spectrin-based meshworks, adsorptive cell surface microvilli, focal adhesions, and adherens junctions (3Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 4Bloch R.J. Bezakova G. Ursitti J.A. Zhou D. Pumplin D.W. Soc. Gen. Physiol.

In each of these domains, interactions between cytoskeletal proteins provide resistance against disruption by nonionic detergents, such as Triton X-100 and octyl glucoside, permitting the transmembrane protein assembly to be isolated as a “membrane skeleton” (8Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar).Lipid-lipid interactions also can organize membranes into detergent-resistant domains. Such lipid “rafts” are stabilized against disruption by cold Triton X-100 through liquid-ordered packing of component cholesterol, (glyco)sphingolipids, and gel-phase glycerolipids (9London E. Brown D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1508: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 10Rietveld A. Simons K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 467-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts contain resident integral membrane proteins, such as caveolin, stomatin, and flotillin (11Galbiati F. Razani B. Lisanti M.P. Cell. 2001; 106: 403-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), extracellular proteins with glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors containing long chain fatty acids (12Benting J. Rietveld A. Ansorge I. Simons K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 47-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic proteins modified by a dual myristoylation/palmitoylation motif or by palmitoylation on two or more cysteine residues (13Melkonian K.A.

Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar). When analyzed in vivo by spectroscopic methods, plasma membrane lipid rafts consist of clusters of ∼20 proteins and ∼3500 sphingolipid molecules and are ∼50 nm in diameter, a size well below the resolution limit of light microscopy (16Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.L. Simons K. Horber J.K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 17Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). These dimensions can be increased into the submicron to micron range through aggregation of raft components, e.g. by receptor activation or addition of bivalent antibodies against raft-associated surface antigens (18Friedrichson T. Kurzchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

After treatment of cells or membranes with cold Triton X-100, the coalescing detergent-resistant remnants of the lipid rafts are called detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs).1 DRMs, which represent a subset of the endogenous raft lipids and proteins (21Pike L.J. Han X. Chung K.N. Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2075-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), can be recovered by flotation into low density fractions (DRM-L) from sucrose or OptiprepTM gradients (19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar).Both cytoskeleton-stabilized membrane domains and lipid rafts provide sites at which localized signal transduction can occur (3Bennett V. Baines A.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1353-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar, 8Luna E.J. Hitt A.L. Science. 1992; 258: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Selective recruitment of proteins from the cytoplasm or protein diffusion within the plane of the membrane can regulate signaling events, such as those downstream of growth factor addition, ion channel activation, or changes in cell adhesion. Because many signaling proteins, including heterotrimeric Gα proteins and members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, are dually acylated, lipid rafts have been proposed as platforms for the controlled interaction of substrates and signaling enzymes (19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 22Bickel P.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: E1-E10Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lipid rafts also have been proposed to play roles in membrane targeting and endocytotic trafficking (23Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Cascades of recruitment of adaptor proteins and kinases to lipid rafts are well characterized during receptor activation in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and mast cells (19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar). Compartmentalized signaling at lipid rafts may be especially important for hematopoietic cells, which form dynamic attachments to substrates and other cells and lack many types of stable cell surface adhesions. Although signaling downstream of lipid raft-associated adhesive stimuli requires filamentous actin (24Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L. Mira E. Lacalle R.A. Gallardo E. Jimenez-Baranda S. Illa I. Bernad A.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3550-3562Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the role of F-actin in this process is unknown.F-actin is known to be an important structural and functional component of plasma membranes from mammalian neutrophils (26Stossel T.P. Sci. Am. 1994; 271 (58–63): 54-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Neutrophils are the most abundant of the circulating leukocytes and are readily available in large quantities from bovine blood (27Mottola C. Gennaro R. Marzullo A. Romeo D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 111: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol.

They are terminally differentiated granulocytes that constitute the body's first line of defense against invading microbes (30Stossel T.P. Babior B.M. Handin R.I. Stossel T.P. Lux S.E. Blood: Principles and Practice of Hematology. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1995: 575-619Google Scholar). In response to chemotactic stimuli from pathogens or from other immune cells and/or mucosal cells, neutrophils rapidly migrate across capillary endothelia into body tissues (31Godaly G. Bergsten G. Hang L. Fischer H. Frendeus B. Lundstedt A.C. Samuelsson M. Samuelsson P. Svanborg C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 69: 899-906PubMed Google Scholar). They engulf microbes coated with complement proteins and/or immunoglobulins and kill the ingested microorganisms by releasing proteases, antimicrobial proteins, and oxygen metabolites into phagolysosomal compartments. Although polarity is maintained by cytoplasmic microtubules (32Nabi I.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1803-1811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), actin function in the membrane skeleton and/or cortical cytoskeleton is required for chemotactic signaling, cell movement, adhesion, and phagocytosis (33Jones G.E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 68: 593-602PubMed Google Scholar).Despite its importance in early immune defense, the neutrophil membrane skeleton is largely uncharacterized. In agreement with previous observations of a spectrin-, actin-, and band 4.1-containing membrane skeleton in neutrophils (34Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Stevenson K.B. Clark R.A. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1989; 74: 2136-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we have shown that a macromolecular complex containing fodrin (non-erythrocyte spectrin), actin, and non-muscle myosin-IIA exists in bovine neutrophil plasma membranes (28Pestonjamasp K. Amieva M.R. Strassel C.P. Nauseef W.M. Furthmayr H. Luna E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar,36Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We also have used F-actin blot overlays and immunoblotting to show that neutrophil plasma membranes contain ezrin, moesin, and a 205-kDa F-actin-binding protein that we named supervillin. Molecular cloning of supervillin cDNA indicated that this protein contains a carboxyl terminus with predicted similarities to villin and a novel amino terminus (36Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 37Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Smith K.P. Wulfkuhle J.D. Strassel C.P. Lawrence J.B. Luna E.J. Genomics. 1998; 52: 342-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The supervillin amino terminus contains functional nuclear targeting signals, sites for direct binding to F-actin, and regions that promote actin filament binding and bundling (38Wulfkuhle J.D. Donina I.E. Stark N.H. Pope R.K. Pestonjamasp K.N. Niswonger M.L. Luna E.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2125-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supervillin is a tightly bound peripheral membrane protein that is concentrated at sites of epithelial cell-cell adhesion (36Pestonjamasp K.N. Pope R.K. Wulfkuhle J.D. Luna E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1255-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This protein also has been reported to be a minor constituent of lipid rafts from detergent-solubilized Jurkat T cells (39von Haller P.D. Donohoe S. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to co-purify with P2X7 ATP receptors from embryonic kidney cells (40Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Supervillin message levels are elevated in neutrophils stimulated with lipopolysaccharide from gingivitis-causing bacteria (41Morozumi T. Kubota T. Sugita N. Ohsawa Y. Yamazaki K. Yoshie H. J. Periodontal Res. 2001; 36: 160-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), implying a role during physiological activation of neutrophils.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we present proteomic and microscopic evidence for a DRM-associated membrane skeleton from neutrophil plasma membranes (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). This lipoprotein complex is enriched in cholesterol (Fig.2) and exhibits a higher buoyant density than do DRMs with less associated membrane skeleton material (Figs. 3 and 7, DRM-Hversus DRM-L). Cytoskeletal proteins characteristically enriched in this fraction include fodrin, supervillin, myosin-IIA, myosin-IG, and α-actinins 1 and 4 (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Immunoaffinity purification of supervillin-associated DRM complexes confirms that these proteins are in the same lipoprotein complexes (Fig. 5). Octyl glucoside extraction demonstrates that most of the hydrophobically associated lipid raft proteins in this complex are relatively stabilized against extraction by this detergent (Figs. 5 and 6). Carbonate extraction demonstrates that the peripheral membrane proteins, supervillin, myosin-IIA, and myosin-IG, are very tightly associated with DRM lipids and/or integral membrane proteins, remaining bound even in the absence of detectable actin (Fig. 6). As supervillin and Gαi-2 immunoreactive proteins appear to preferentially co-localize in actin-rich areas of cells engaged in active spreading (Figs. 1 and 7 D), the DRM-H fraction may represent a transiently induced, membrane skeleton-associated subset of neutrophil signaling domains (Fig.8).The buoyant density of the DRM-H fraction (d ∼1.16 g/ml) is probably the reason it has not been described previously. DRM purification methods typically involve the collection of lipoprotein complexes with densities within the range of 1.02 to 1.16 (5–35% sucrose) (39von Haller P.D. Donohoe S. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 74Fiedler K. Kobayashi T. Kurzchalia T.V. Simons K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6365-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), whereas Triton-insoluble membrane skeletons characteristically exhibit densities of 1.25–1.3 (∼50–64% sucrose) (75Goodloe-Holland C.M. Luna E.J. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 103-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 76Sheetz M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 557: 122-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Presumably, attachment of DRM-associated proteins to the cytoskeleton causes an increased density due to the increased ratio of protein to lipid in the detergent-resistant fraction, resulting in equilibrium banding at intermediate sucrose concentrations. DRMs with densities in the range of our DRM-H fraction (d ∼ 1.15–1.18; 33–40% sucrose) are likely to sediment, or to be spread throughout, the 30–35% sucrose step gradient used in many DRM purification methods (39von Haller P.D.

Similarly, the DRM-H fraction would not be detected in related lipoprotein complexes prepared in the absence of nonionic detergents (58Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 77Song K.S., Li, S. Okamoto T. Quilliam L.A. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2542) Google Scholar,58Smart E.J. Ying Y.-S. Mineo C. Anderson R.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Also, the isolated DRM-H fraction is not necessarily homogeneous with respect to the relative ratios of the co-isolating proteins. For instance, the small amount of DRM-H clathrin (Fig. 4) may be caused by a few contaminating coated pits or it may represent a limited association between coated membrane and a subset of DRMs. Other components of the DRM-H fraction, especially proteins present in minor amounts, remain for future analysis. The determination of which proteins interact through direct interactions and which are co-associated through a common affinity for the gel-phase DRM lipids is similarly beyond the scope of this investigation. However, the silver-stained profile of proteins that co-sediment as the DRM-H fraction (Figs. 3, 4, and 7) is similar to the pattern of proteins that are co-purified using antibodies directed against supervillin (Fig. 5). This result suggests that supervillin directly or indirectly associates with lipoprotein complexes containing the other proteins in Fig. 4 and may therefore serve as a marker protein for DRM-H rafts in neutrophil plasma membranes.Our results are consistent with electron microscopic observations of a subplasmalemmal filament complex associated with Triton X-100-extracted neutrophil ghosts (80Jesaitis A.J. Naemura J.R. Sklar L.A. Cochrane C.G. Painter R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1378-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and plasma membrane remnants of sheared neutrophils (51Boyles J. Bainton D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 82: 347-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 52Boyles J. Bainton D.F. Cell. 1981; 24: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the latter studies, high resolution scanning electron micrographs revealed that the cytoplasmic surfaces of adherent, spreading neutrophils contain interlocking networks of globular centers and radiating branched filaments. Morphologically similar networks are observed in cross-sections of purified plasma membranes (Fig. 3 D,a) and in negatively stained DRM-H samples (Fig. 3 D,b andc). Given our observations of myosin-IIA and myosin-IG bound to DRMs lacking detectable F-actin, these domains may represent regions where actin and myosin are recruited and organized at the membrane, as originally implied (52Boyles J. Bainton D.F. Cell. 1981; 24: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Our data also agree with the initial observation that neutrophils contain a fodrin- and actin-based, detergent-resistant membrane skeleton (35Stevenson K.B. Clark R.A. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1989; 74: 2136-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This membrane skeleton has been implicated in the lateral organization of components of the superoxide-generating machinery (81Quinn M.T. Parkos C.A. Jesaitis A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 987: 83-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and in the segregation of chemoreceptors and Gi-2 proteins during neutrophil stimulation (34Jesaitis A.J. Bokoch G.M. Tolley J.O. Allen R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 82Jesaitis A.J. Tolley J.O. Bokoch G.M. Allen R.A. J.

Borregaard N. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The partial superimposition of the supervillin and Gαi-2immunofluorescence signals (Fig. 7 D) suggests that at least some of these areas of overlap may correspond to domains involved in the active signaling between chemotactic receptors and the actin cytoskeleton.Actin, spectrin, or fodrin, and/or associated proteins have been co-purified with lipid raft components from other hematopoietic cell types. For example, erythrocyte DRMs are enriched in stomatin, flotillins 1 and 2, β-actin, and a loosely bound member of the spectrin gene family (65Salzer U. Prohaska R. Blood. 2001; 97: 1141-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). More recently, a complex mixture of DRMs from unstimulated Jurkat T lymphocytes was found to contain a subset of proteins reminiscent of those identified here (39von Haller P.D. Donohoe S. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Watts J.D. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among a total of ∼70 DRM proteins, including markers for mitochondria, rough endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, and the nuclear envelope, were sequences representative of fodrin, myosin-IIA heavy and light chains, supervillin, myosin-IG (GenBankTM accession numberAI089291), vimentin, β-actin, flotillin 2, Gαi-2, and the Src-related tyrosine kinase Lck. Although it is not known whether these proteins co-associate with each other in T cells, as opposed to being present in different DRMs, it is striking that 12 of the 25 polypeptides identified in our study are also present in total Jurkat T cell DRMs. Thus, lipid raft-associated membrane skeletons similar to DRM-H may be present in hematopoietic cells of different origin.The neutrophil DRM-H fraction also exhibits some compositional similarities to the microdomains associated with the multichain receptor for IgE (FcεR) in mast cells (86Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 87Holowka D. Baird B. Semin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both types of domains are cholesterol-rich and contain bound immunoglobulin, actin, and Lyn kinase (19Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5111) Google Scholar, 88Dykstra M. Cherukuri A. Pierce S.K. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 699-707PubMed Google Scholar). The relatively tight association of IgM with DRM-H fragments (Fig. 6) is consistent with the reported presence of a specific receptor for IgM on bovine neutrophils (70Grewal A.S. Rouse B.T. Babiuk L.A. Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 1978; 56: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 71Williams M.R. Hill A.W. Res. Vet.

In mouse and human, an ∼70-kDa receptor that binds IgA as well as IgM (Fcα/μR) has been shown to mediate internalization of IgM-coatedStaphylococcus aureus (89Shibuya A. Sakamoto N. Shimizu Y. Shibuya K. Osawa M. Hiroyama T. Eyre H.J. Sutherland G.R. Endo Y. Fujita T. Miyabayashi T. Sakano S. Tsuji T. Nakayama E. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. Nakauchi H. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Another Fcμ receptor exists as an ∼60-kDa GPI-linked isoform in hematopoietic cells (90Nakamura T. Kubagawa H. Ohno T. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6933-6941PubMed Google Scholar, 91Ohno T. Kubagawa H. Sanders S.K. Cooper M.D. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Either type of Fcμ receptor would be hard to detect in the presence of the more abundant, co-electrophoresing IgM decamer, leaving open the question of whether the IgM that co-sediments with the neutrophil DRM-H fraction is bound through a specific Fc receptor.Although not documented previously, the actin-independent association of myosins and other F-actin-binding proteins with DRMs is consistent with reports (92Rodgers W. Zavzavadjian J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 267: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 93Valensin S. Paccani S.R. Ulivieri C. Mercati D. Pacini S. Patrussi L. Hirst T. Lupetti P. Baldari C.T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) indicating that lipid raft domains are intrinsically linked to active movements of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. After priming by receptor occupancy with IgE, for example, the FcεR is associated with Lyn in lipid rafts on mast cells (86Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Following receptor cross-linking by multivalent antigen, the structure and organization of these microdomains are changed both by actin-based lateral movements of signal transduction proteins within the plane of the membrane and by recruitment of signaling proteins from cytoplasmic stores (94Wilson B.S. Pfeiffer J.R. Oliver J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1131-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 95Holowka D. Sheets E.D. Baird B. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1009-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar mechanisms also target specific lipid raft components to the front and rear of polarized leukocytes (24Gomez-Mouton C. Abad J.L.

https://openalex.org/W1981577753,"The Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein (CAP) activates transcription at P lac , P gal , and other promoters through interactions with the RNA polymerase α subunit carboxyl-terminal domain (αCTD). We determined the crystal structure of the CAP-αCTD-DNA complex at a resolution of 3.1 angstroms. CAP makes direct protein-protein interactions with αCTD, and αCTD makes direct protein-DNA interactions with the DNA segment adjacent to the DNA site for CAP. There are no large-scale conformational changes in CAP and αCTD, and the interface between CAP and αCTD is small. These findings are consistent with the proposal that activation involves a simple “recruitment” mechanism."

Studies on the regulation of ABCA1 by the liver X receptor agonist 24(S)OH-cholesterol revealed increased ABCA1 expression and apoA-I-dependent [3H]cholesterol efflux from pBCEC. In unpolarized pBCEC, high density lipoprotein, subclass 3 (HDL3)-dependent [3H]cholesterol efflux, was unaffected by 24(S)OH-cholesterol treatment but was enhanced 5-fold in SR-BI overexpressing pBCEC. Efflux of cellular 24(S)-[3H]OH-cholesterol was highly efficient, independent of ABCA1, and correlated with SR-BI expression. Polarized pBCEC were cultured on porous membrane filters that allow separate access to the apical and the basolateral compartment. Addition of cholesterol acceptors to the apical compartment resulted in preferential [3H]cholesterol efflux to the basolateral compartment. HDL3 was a better promoter of basolateral [3H]cholesterol efflux than lipid-free apoA-I. Basolateral pretreatment with 24(S)OH-cholesterol enhanced apoA-I-dependent basolateral cholesterol efflux up to 2-fold along with the induction of ABCA1 at the basolateral membrane. Secretion of apoA-I also occurred preferentially to the basolateral compartment, where the majority of apoA-I was recovered in an HDL-like density range. In contrast, 24(S)-[3H]OH-cholesterol was mobilized efficiently to the apical compartment of the in vitro BBB by HDL3, low density lipoprotein, and serum. These results suggest the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism for removal of potentially neurotoxic 24(S)OH-cholesterol.

At the same time it has become generally accepted that high density lipoproteins (HDL)1 protect against atherosclerosis and possibly against neurodegenerative diseases by modulating sterol flux. For instance, a defect in intracellular cholesterol trafficking might be etiologically important in progressive neurodegeneration observed in Niemann-Pick type C disease (1Xie C. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11992-11997Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Studies performed in cell culture, animal models, and on human post-mortem material indicate that cholesterol is a major determinant affecting the severity of Alzheimer's disease and the deposition of intraneuronal amyloid β (reviewed in Ref. 2Sparks D.L. Martin T.A. Gross D.R. Hunsaker III, J.C. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2000; 50: 287-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In line with this, the outcome of retrospective studies demonstrated a strong decrease in the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and dementia for patients that were treated with statins, inhibitors of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis (3Wolozin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5371-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar,4Jick H. Zornberg G.L. Jick S.S. Seshadri S. Drachman D.A. Lancet. 2000; 356: 1627-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Moreover, decreased serum HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) concentrations correlate with the severity of Alzheimer's disease (5Merched A. Xia Y. Visvikis S. Serot J.M. Siest G. Neurobiol. Aging. 2000; 21: 27-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Several subtypes of neuropathies observed in patients suffering Tangier disease, a disorder characterized by severe deficiency or the absence of circulating HDL, further underline the importance of functional HDL metabolism for normal function of the central nervous system. Tangier disease is caused by mutations in the ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 gene, and the absence of HDL is because of defective assembly of cholesterol and phospholipids with apoA-I (reviewed in Refs. 6Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar and 7Santamarina-Fojo S. Remaley A.T. Neufeld E.B. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of the most striking differences between cholesterol metabolism in the brain and the periphery is the slow turnover of cerebral cholesterol, accounting for 0.1–1% of the turnover observed in the periphery (8Dietschy J.M. Turley S.D. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts exchange with plasma lipoproteins, the brain covers a major part of its own cholesterol demand by de novo synthesis (9Turley S.D. Burns D.K. Dietschy J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E1099-E1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the integrity of the BBB itself strongly depends on cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Another major difference is a unique strategy of the brain to secrete cholesterol. The removal of excess cholesterol from the brain is partly accounted for by the conversion to the more polar metabolite 24(S)OH-cholesterol by cytochrome P46 (cholesterol 24(S)-hydroxylase) (10Lund E.G. Guileyardo J.M. Russell D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7238-7243Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and subsequent secretion across the BBB for elimination by the liver (11Björkhem I. Andersson U. Ellis E. Alvelius G. Ellegard L. Diczfalusy U. Sjovall J. Einarsson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37004-37010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Consistent with the conversion to 24(S)OH-cholesterol being the major pathway for the maintenance of brain cholesterol homeostasis, 24(S)OH-cholesterol levels are elevated in cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's patients (12Papassotiropoulos A. Lutjohann D. Bagli M. Locatelli S. Jessen F. Buschfort R. Ptok U. Bjorkhem I. von Bergmann K. Heun R. J. Psychiatr. Res. 2002; 36: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and in plasma correlate with the severity of dementia (13Lütjohann D. Papassotiropoulos A. Bjorkhem I. Locatelli S. Bagli M.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 195-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably as a consequence of increased cholesterol turnover. Thus far, the underlying mechanisms that contribute to sterol transport and homeostasis in the brain and at the BBB are relatively obscure. In contrast, in peripheral tissues many steps of the protective pathway that prevent the excess accumulation of cholesterol, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), have been elucidated. ABCA1 has been identified as the primary gatekeeper for eliminating tissue cholesterol, because it mediates the apolipoprotein-dependent transfer of intracellular cholesterol and phospholipid to lipid-free apoA-I (14Bodzioch M.

Partially lipidated apoA-I matures into spherical HDL via esterification of cholesterol by plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and HDL particles are processed and remodeled by the combined actions of cholesteryl ester and phospholipid transfer proteins and of hepatic lipase (17Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Scavenger receptor class B, type I (SR-BI), highly expressed in liver parenchymal cells, takes up cholesteryl esters selectively, i.e. without concomitant HDL particle endocytosis (18Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and cholesterol and its catabolites are finally excreted into bile. Depending on the concentration gradient of cholesterol, SR-BI also promotes cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells to HDL but not to lipid-free apoA-I (19Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L.

The endothelial cell lineage of the BBB is able to synthesize a number of proteins exhibiting key functions during RCT. As recently reported by our group (21Goti D. Hammer A. Galla H.J. Malle E.

In addition, porcine brain endothelial cells have been reported to synthesize apoA-I (23Möckel B. Zinke H. Flach R. Weiss B. Weiler-Guttler H. Gassen H.G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and apoA-I abundantly present in the central nervous system is obviously transported across the BBB (8Dietschy J.M.

With the present study we aimed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cholesterol and 24(S)OH-cholesterol transport at the BBB by studying the functions and regulation of key players in RCT that are expressed by pBCEC, i.e. SR-BI, apoA-I, and ABCA1 (Refs. 21Goti D.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). pBCEC (from one brain) were cultured in 6 × 75-cm2 collagen-coated culture flasks with M199 containing 10% ox serum, 1% gentamycin, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.35% glutamine (v/v). After 3 days the cells were plated onto collagen-coated multiwell or Transwell® (6- or 12-well) cell culture dishes at a density of 40,000 or 80,000 cells/cm2, respectively. Transwell® cultures were grown for 2 or 3 days, depending on the trans-endothelial electrical resistance (≥70 ohms/cm2) prior to induction of tight junction formation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F-12 medium, containing 150 nm hydrocortisone, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.35% glutamine (v/v). After 1–2 days of induction, dishes with 300–1000 ohms/cm2 were used for experiments. Human apoE-free HDL3 and low density lipoproteins (LDL) were prepared by density gradient ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from normolipidemic human volunteers in a TL120 tabletop ultracentrifuge (350,000 × g; Beckman Instruments, Vienna, Austria) (27Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Lipoproteins recovered by direct aspiration were desalted by size-exclusion chromatography on PD-10 columns, and purity was confirmed via SDS-PAGE identification of associated proteins. ApoA-I was isolated as described (28Bergt C. Oettl K. Keller W. Andreae F. Leis H.J. Malle E. Sattler W. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on detergent-extracted (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 40 mm NaF, 5 mmEGTA, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) pBCEC proteins that were separated by 6% (ABCA1), 8% (SR-BI), 10% (LXRα), or 12% (apoA-I) SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (150 V, 90 min). To analyze apoA-I secretion by pBCEC, cellular supernatants were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Proteins were precipitated with 3 m trichloroacetic acid (0.1 ml/ml supernatant, 30 min, 4 °C) and pelleted by centrifugation. Pellets were washed with 0.5 ml of acetone and resuspended in 60 μl of sample buffer (0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 1% mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 95 °C for 5 min before application to gels. For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 150 mA, 4 °C, for 120 (ABCA1) or 60 min (SR-BI, LXRα, and apoA-I). Immunochemical detection of the respective proteins was performed using polyclonal rabbit anti-human/mouse ABCA1 antiserum raised against the C-terminal peptide 2177–2199 (1:500), polyclonal rabbit anti-human SR-BI (1:1500), anti-human apoA-I (1:2000), and goat anti-human LXRα (1:500) IgG as primary antibodies. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:4000) or donkey anti-goat IgG (1:1000) and subsequent ECL development. Bands were quantified densitometrically using camera, scanner, and software from Herolab (Heidelberg, Germany). The relative percentage of plasma membrane ABCA1 was analyzed as described (29Marmorstein A. Zurzolo C. le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: a Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 341-350Google Scholar). In brief, ice-cold sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 1.3 mmCaCl2) was added twice either to the apical or basolateral chamber of 6-well Transwell® pBCEC cultures and incubated for 20 min (4 °C). The reaction was quenched by replacing the solution with 50 mm NH4Cl for 10 min; filters were then washed and excised, and cellular proteins were extracted in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors. After a sham precipitating with preimmune serum, ABCA1 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antiserum overnight (4 °C). Biotinylated ABCA1 was immunodetected using streptavidin-HRP and subsequent ECL development (29Marmorstein A. Zurzolo C. le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: a Laboratory Handbook. 4. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 341-350Google Scholar). Total polyadenylated RNA from pBCEC, RBE4 (immortalized rat brain endothelial cells, kindly provided by Neurotech SA, Evry, France), human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC, kindly provided by Dr. R. Heller, Erfurt, Germany), and lung carcinoma epithelial-HUVEC hybridoma cells (EAHY, kindly provided by Dr. W. F. Graier, Graz, Austria) was isolated according to the RNeasy protocol (Qiagen). Three μg of total RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I for 15 min at 37 °C and used as a template for first strand cDNA synthesis (the reaction mix contained 0.5 mm dNTPs, 15 units of RNAguard, 3.3 μm random hexamer primers, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1× First Strand Buffer, and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase). Reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 37 °C and stopped at 75 °C for 10 min. Fifty-μl PCRs contained 0.2 mm dNTPs, appropriate oligonucleotide primers at 10 μm, 1× PCR buffer, and 1 unit of Finnzyme DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase. The reaction mix was heated at 94 °C for 4 min, and amplification was carried out for 35 cycles (denaturation, 30 s at 94 °C; annealing, 30 s at 57 °C; extension 1 min at 72 °C). Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of ABCA1 are as follows: forward primer 5′-GTTCTCAGATGCTCGGAGGCTTCTT and reverse primer 5′-GACAATACGAGACACAGCCTGGTAG (MWG Biotech; Ebersberg, Germany). A 609-bp fragment was obtained. cDNA for ABCA1 was amplified using human ABCA1-specific primers. Oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of apoA-I are as follows: forward primer 5′-CTGACCTTGGCTGTGCTCTT and reverse primer 5′-atccttctggcggtacgtctc (MWG Biotech; Ebersberg, Germany). A 410-bp cDNA fragment was obtained. RT-PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels. Efflux of cellular sterols was analyzed as described previously (30Panzenböck U. Kritharides L. Raftery M. Rye K.A. Stocker R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19536-19544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In brief, sterol pools of pBCEC monolayers were metabolically labeled in medium containing 10% ox serum and 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol or 0.1 μCi/ml 24(S)-[3H]OH-cholesterol for 24–48 h. The “labeling” medium was then replaced with medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (w/v) for 16 h to equilibrate labeled cholesterol or for 1 h to equilibrate labeled 24(S)OH-cholesterol among cellular pools. Where indicated, 24(S)OH-cholesterol (10 μm) or 9-cis-retinoic acid (10 μm) was added during equilibration for 16 h. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with PBS before starting efflux incubations. Sterol acceptors (i.e. apoA-I, HDL3, LDL, serum, or albumin) were added in serum-free medium at the indicated concentrations. At the indicated times, aliquots of efflux media were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the radioactivity of the respective tracers was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The remaining intact monolayers were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 0.3 m NaOH (2 h, 4 °C), and aliquots of the lysates were then used to count radioactivity and to determine the cellular protein content using the method of Lowryet al. (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to metabolically label the sterol pools of polarized pBCEC grown on Transwell® filters, the tracer was added to the basolateral compartment (i.e. lower chamber, representing the “brain parenchymal side”) for the duration of the inducing period or as otherwise indicated. Sterol acceptors were added to the apical compartment (i.e. upper chamber, representing the “microvessel lumenal side”) and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated periods. Efflux media were collected from both chambers and treated as above; cells on filter inserts were lysed in 0.3m NaOH at 4 °C overnight prior to determining cell-associated radioactivity and cell protein. Sterol efflux was calculated as the percentage of the sum of the total medium and cellular counts/min. ABCA1-dependent cholesterol efflux was inhibited with DIDS, and P-glycoprotein function was inhibited with PSC833. Adenoviral plasmid shuttle vector (pAvCvSv) and pJM17 vectors were kindly supplied by L. Chan (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and human SR-BI cDNA by H. Hauser (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland). Human SR-BI adenovirus and control β-galactosidase virus were amplified and purified exactly as described previously (22Goti D. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Frank S. van Der Westhuyzen D.R. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). pBCEC cultivated in 12-well culture dishes at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 were transfected with recombinant adenoviruses (multiplicity of infection = 1000 plaque-forming units/ml; 16 h) as described (22Goti D. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Frank S. van Der Westhuyzen D.R. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Expression levels of SR-BI were analyzed by densitometric evaluation of Western blots. Unless otherwise indicated in the individual figure legends, all data shown represent means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. Two-tailed Student's t tests and two-way analysis of variance were performed using Prism software (Graphpad). Because ABCA1 and apoA-I represent key players in RCT, we initially analyzed their expression by pBCEC. Among the various endothelial cell types investigated by RT-PCR, pBCEC and HUVEC exhibited a prominent signal for ABCA1 mRNA, followed by EAHY hybridoma cells, whereas no mRNA was detected in RBE4 cells (Fig.1 A). The expression of apoA-I by microcapillary endothelial cells has been reported earlier (23Möckel B. Zinke H. Flach R. Weiss B. Weiler-Guttler H. Gassen H.G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 788-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and our data confirmed that pBCEC secrete substantial amounts of apoA-I into the culture medium, whereas only traces were detectable in cell lysates (Fig. 1 B). The identification of apoA-I mRNA in these cells further suggested that at least part of the secreted apoA-I is derived from endogenous biosynthesis (Fig. 1 C). ABCA1 mediates the transfer of cellular cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I. Oxysterols, including 24(S)OH-cholesterol, are high affinity endogenous ligands for LXR, the nuclear receptor that upon dimerization with retinoid X receptor (RXR) induces ABCA1 gene transcription in macrophages and other cells (reviewed in Refs. 6Schmitz G. Langmann T. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar and 7Santamarina-Fojo S. Remaley A.T. Neufeld E.B. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1339-1345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore investigated apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from pBCEC monolayers and the effect of 24(S)OH-cholesterol on cholesterol efflux and on the regulation of ABCA1 protein expression (Fig.2). As shown in Fig. 2 A, apoA-I dose-dependently mobilized cellular [3H]cholesterol from pBCEC. Cholesterol efflux was enhanced up to 1.6-fold (at concentrations between 5 and 50 μg apoA-I/ml culture medium) in response to physiological concentrations of 24(S)OH-cholesterol. The RXR ligand 9-cis-retinoic acid exhibited only a minor effect on cholesterol release, and the addition of both ligands exhibited an effect equivalent to 24(S)OH-cholesterol alone. It may be important to note that basal cholesterol efflux (i.e. in the absence of exogenous apoA-I) from pBCEC was relatively high as compared with RBE4 cells (2.9 ± 0.6% versus 0.9 ± 0.12% for pBCEC and RBE4, respectively; data for RBE4 not shown). Since, in contrast to pBCEC, RBE4 did not secrete apoA-I (as determined by immunoblotting, data not shown), it is reasonable to assume that endogenous secretion of apoA-I contributes to cholesterol removal from pBCEC under basal conditions. In line with increased cholesterol efflux to lipid-free apoA-I, pretreatment of pBCEC with 24(S)OH-cholesterol induced the expression of ABCA1 protein (4- and 6-fold, at 2.5 and 10 μm 24(S)OH-cholesterol, respectively) and of LXRα (3- and 4-fold, at 2.5 and 10 μm24(S)OH-cholesterol), as determined by densitometric evaluation of immunoblots (Fig. 2 B). To support the possibility that ABCA1 is responsible for apoA-I-dependent cholesterol removal, we tested the effect of the ABC transporter inhibitor DIDS that dose-dependently inhibited both basal (27.5 ± 12.9% inhibition) and 24(S)OH-cholesterol-induced (51.3 ± 6.7% inhibition) [3H]cholesterol efflux (Fig. 2 C). It is important to note that DIDS inhibits cholesterol efflux in the absence of exogenous apoA-I, indicating that the ABCA1 pathway in pBCEC is constitutively active. By contrast, the specific P-glycoprotein inhibitor PSC833 (0.1–10 μm) failed to inhibit [3H]cholesterol efflux (data not shown), confirming that P-glycoproteins are not involved. These results together are consistent with a major role for ABCA1 in apoA-I-mediated cholesterol efflux from pBCEC, a process that is regulated by 24(S)OH-cholesterol via an LXR-dependent pathway. In addition to ABCA1 and apoA-I, SR-BI plays a major role in RCT. SR-BI mediates selective uptake of HDL-associated lipids, but it may also mediate HDL-dependent net cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues, presumably depending on the gradient of the chemical potential of the lipid between cell surface and acceptor particle (19Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20982-20985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed S"

https://openalex.org/W2083645860,"Barrett's metaplasia (BM) is an early lesion in the progression from oesophageal inflammation through dysplasia to the development of Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BA). Previous work indicates that BM and BA are associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and increased cytoplasmic/nuclear pools of its associated protein β-catenin. β-catenin participates in Wnt signalling and activates oncogene transcription by complexing with T-cells factors (TCF). One such oncogene is c-myc. We have previously shown that TNF-α can down-regulate E-cadherin expression. Here, we assess TNF-α expression in Barrett's metaplasia and examine if TNF-α can promote β-catenin mediated transcription of oncogenes in a gastrointestinal model system. Employing immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis of oesophageal tissue, epithelial expression of TNF-α increases with progression along the metaplasia–dysplasia–carcinoma sequence (P<0.001). β-catenin mediated transcription was then assessed in TNF-α stimulated cell lines using the TOPFLASH reporter system whilst c-myc expression was assessed by real time PCR. In a columnar intestinal cell model, TNF-α induces c-myc expression which is induced via β-catenin mediated transcription (P<0.05). This β-catenin mediated transcription is independent of NF-κB activation. Thus, TNF-α is up-regulated in the progression of Barrett's oesophagus and β-catenin mediated transcription of c-myc is a novel pathway whereby elevated levels of TNF-α may lead to oncogene transcription and altered biology in gastrointestinal epithelia and metaplasia."

BDNF activates TRKB on the cell surface, which leads to the initiation of intracellular signaling cascades and different biological responses in neurons. Neuronal activity has been shown to regulate TRKB levels on the plasma membrane of neurons, but little is known about other factors affecting TRKB surface expression levels. We report here that BDNF regulates the cell surface levels of transfected or endogenously expressed full-length TRKB, depending on the exposure time in neuroblastoma cells and primary hippocampal neurons. BDNF rapidly increases TRKB surface expression levels in seconds, whereas treatment of cells with BDNF for a longer time (minutes to hours) leads to decreased TRKB surface levels. Coexpression of the full-length TRKB together with the truncated TRKB.T1 isoform results in decreased levels of full-length TRKB on the cell surface. This effect is specific to the T1 isoform, because coexpression of a kinase-dead TRKB mutant or another kinase domain-lacking TRKB form, truncated T-Shc, leads to increased TRKB surface levels.

The recently cloned truncated T-Shc contains an Shc-binding site in the juxtamembrane domain similar to TK+, but it lacks the kinase domain and has a unique truncated C terminus (30Stoilov P. Castren E. Stamm S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). T-Shc is predominantly expressed in the brain, but its role is so far mostly unknown. TK+ and T1 are localized to both somatodendritic and axonal compartments in neurons (41Kryl D. Yacoubian T. Haapasalo A. Castrén E., Lo, D. Barker P.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5823-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the cell surface is the primary site where TK+ activation takes place and subsequent intracellular signaling is initiated, in unstimulated cells the majority of TK+ is located intracellularly, and only a small amount of TK+ can be detected on the neuronal surface (42Meyer-Franke A.

Activation of neurons has been shown to increase the cell surface expression levels of TK+ in both retinal ganglion cells (42Meyer-Franke A. Wilkinson G.A. Kruttgen A., Hu, M. Munro E.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), but little is known about other factors that regulate TK+ levels on the cell surface. In this study we have investigated the cell surface expression levels of transfected and endogenous TRKB isoforms in N2a neuroblastoma cells and primary hippocampal neuron cultures. We report that the cell surface levels of TK+ can be differentially regulated both by the ligand BDNF and coexpression of different truncated TRKB isoforms. These results may provide evidence of how BDNF signaling can be affected by regulating TK+ surface levels in active neurons in vivo. Plasmid DNA encoding fusion proteins of full-length TRKB.TK+ and/or truncated TRKB.T1 and N-terminal GFP or FLAG tag were used for transfections (pGFP-TK+, pGFP-T1, pFLAG-TK+, pFLAG-T1 (39Haapasalo A.

T-Shc construct (pGFP-T-Shc) contains a 5′ GFP tag and encodes for GFP-T-Shc fusion protein (30Stoilov P. Castren E. Stamm S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 1054-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). pGFP or pEGFP-F (GFP-F, Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) cDNAs were used as controls. N-terminally FLAG-tagged ΔATP mutant construct (pFLAG-ΔATP) was cloned by using pFLAG-TK+ as a template by overlap extension PCR method. An A→T point mutation resulting in amino acid change from Lys560 to methionine at the ATP-binding site was introduced into pFLAG-TK+ cDNA (sequence numbering according to rat TRKB.TK+ sequence, GenBank accession number M55291 (20Middlemas D.S. Lindberg R.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar)). Two mutagenizing primers (mut1 and mut2) with overlapping sequence and two outside primers (out1 and out2) flanking the mutated sequence with following sequences were designed as follows: mut1 (nucleotides 2366–2395) 5′-GTGGCCGTGAT*GACGCTGAAGGACGCCAG-3′; mut2(nucleotides 2355–2385) 5′-TTCAGCGTCA*TCACGGCCACCAGGATCTTA-3′; out1(nucleotides 1466–1485) 5′-gcagaaaacctcgtcggaga-3′; out2(nucleotides 3282–3303) 5′-AGAAGCGAGTCGATACTGTCT-3′. Boldface letters in sequence indicate overlapping sequence between the two primers, and * indicates the A→T point mutation. First, two separate reactions (one with out1 and mut2 primers and the other with out2 and mut1 primers) were performed by using pFLAG-TK+ cDNA as a template. In the reactions 100 ng of template DNA, 20 pmol of each primer, 0.25 mm dNTP mixture, and 1 unit of Dynazyme EXT DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Finland) were used. The PCR program used is as follows: initial denaturation 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 20 cycles (30 s, 94 °C; 90 s, 60 °C; 90 s, 72 °C). The next PCR was performed by usingout1 and out2 primers and 0.5 μl of purified PCR products from each previous reaction (919 and 937 bp, respectively) as template. The 1837-bp PCR product and parental pFLAG-TK+ were digested with NdeI and HpaI resulting in 1505- and 6595-bp DNA fragments, respectively. The fragments were ligated (Rapid DNA Ligation kit, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and transformed to DHα-competent Escherichia coli cells. The correct clone was verified by automated sequencing. Receptor autophosphorylation assay in transfected N2a cells (39Haapasalo A. Koponen E. Hoppe E. Wong G. Castrén E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) showed that ΔATP mutant protein does not autophosphorylate after BDNF treatment, indicating that pFLAG-ΔATP encodes for a kinase-dead TRKB receptor (data not shown). N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells were cultured and transfected as described elsewhere (39Haapasalo A. Koponen E. Hoppe E. Wong G. Castrén E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 44Haapasalo A. Saarelainen T. Moshnyakov M. Arumae U. Kiema T.R. Saarma M. Wong G. Castrén E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). N2a cells used in electrophysiological recordings were harvested from a confluent monolayer, plated 1:4 unto sterile coverslips 22 × 22 mm (Warner Instruments) coated with poly-l-lysine (0.1 mg/ml), and grown for 3–4 days. Embryonic E17 hippocampal cultures were prepared as described (45Haapasalo A. Kukkonen L. Saarelainen T. Castrén E. Biochemica. 1999; 3: 20-22Google Scholar) and transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described by Xia et al. (46Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hippocampal neurons were used for experiments at 8–12 days in vitro (DIV). All cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen. The cells were treated with 50 ng/ml BDNF (PeproTech, London, UK) for 5 min, 1 or 24 h, or with 200 nm (1 h) K252a (Calbiochem) at +37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Fifteen-second BDNF treatment was performed with the cell plate on ice with BDNF diluted to 50 ng/ml in cell culture medium pre-equilibrated to +21 °C. The cell culture plates were quickly rinsed twice in ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.1 mmMgCl2 (PBS-Ca-Mg) and kept on ice to stop protein trafficking immediately after the treatments. Cell surface proteins were biotinylated for 30 min with 0.25 mg/ml biotin (Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin, Pierce) diluted in PBS-Ca-Mg. Unbound biotin was quenched by washing cells twice and then again for 20 min at +4 °C with PBS-Ca-Mg containing 0.1 m glycine. Total protein fractions were extracted as described previously (39Haapasalo A. Koponen E. Hoppe E. Wong G. Castrén E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Three hundred (N2a cells) or 150 μg (hippocampal neurons) of total protein were precipitated with 25 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce) in a total volume of 200 μl overnight at +4 °C by rotation. The beads were washed three times in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4, two times in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4, once in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then for 5 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 25 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, separated on 6% SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters as described previously (39Haapasalo A. Koponen E. Hoppe E. Wong G. Castrén E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). TRKB bands were detected with α-TRKBout antibody (1:5000, a gift from Dr. David Kaplan, Montreal Neurological Institute, Canada). SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) was used for ECL detection. Streptavidin beads specifically precipitated only biotinylated proteins, since precipitation of unbiotinylated cells resulted in no signal on the nitrocellulose filter, which was stained for total protein in Ponceau S. The nontransfected biotinylated cells also did not give any signal after α-TRKBout antibody and ECL detection (data not shown). The intensities of TRKB bands on the films were quantified from digitized images by using MCID/M4 image analysis program, version 3 (Imaging Research Inc., St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada). Western blotting of the total TRKB pool was performed by loading 40 μg of total protein from the biotinylated samples on 6% SDS-PAGE gels. Electroblotting, antibody detection, and quantification of the TRKB bands were performed as described above. The transfected hippocampal neurons and N2a cells were fixed and stained with α-FLAG antibody (1:1000, Sigma) as described (44Haapasalo A. Saarelainen T. Moshnyakov M. Arumae U. Kiema T.R. Saarma M. Wong G. Castrén E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1285-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The coverslips were mounted with Gel/Mount anti-fading mounting media (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). Confocal images were obtained at ×100 magnification with Nikon Eclipse TE 300 fluorescence microscope connected to Ultra View confocal scanner (Life Science Resources) and UltraPix CCD camera. The excitation wavelengths were 488 nm for GFP and 568 nm for α-FLAG/α-mouse Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands)-stained samples. Voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents were studied in voltage-clamp mode at room temperature (+23 °C) using the standard whole-cell configuration (47Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar). The extracellular bath solution consisted of the following (in mm): TEA-Cl 125, HEPES 10, BaCl2 15, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, tetrodotoxin 0.1; pH was adjusted to 7.3 with TEA-OH. The involvement of Ca2+ channels was verified with 100 μmCd2+. In some experiments, extracellular BaCl2was exchanged with CaCl2 in order to identify low voltage-activated T-type Ca2+ currents; the relative conductance for Ba2+ and Ca2+ ions is in general similar to LVA T-type-like currents, whereas Ba2+> Ca2+ for HVA currents (48Kostyuk P.G. Neuroscience. 1999; 92: 1157-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The intracellular pipette solution consisted of the following (in mm): CsCl 100, HEPES 40, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid 10, CaCl2 2.5, ATP (magnesium salt) 4.2, GTP (sodium salt) 0.6; pH was adjusted to 7.15 with CsOH. Cover glasses with N2a cells, grown 50–70% confluent, were placed on the bottom of an RC-24 40-μl fast exchange chamber (Warner Instruments), and round cells without processes were selected for investigation. The extracellular bath solution was perfused 0.75–1 ml/min via a manually gravidity controlled application system consisting of a series of reservoirs attached to a perfusion manifold (Warner Instruments) positioned just before the chamber inlet. Patch clamp pipettes (PG150T, Harvard Apparatus, UK) were prepared with a PC-10 puller and fire-polished with a micro-forge MF-900 (Narishige, UK) to a resistance of 3.0–3.5 megohms measured in the extracellular bath solution. The perfusion chamber was grounded using a 2% agar bridge with 0.9% NaCl connected to an Ag/AgCl wire. Voltage protocols and data acquisition were controlled with pClamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments). An Osborne 800 MHz PIII computer was used to control the patch clamp amplifier Axopatch 200A via a Digidata 1320E SCSI PCI interface (Axon Instruments). Recordings were digitally sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz using the analog low pass bessel filter on the recording amplifier. Series resistance was compensated to 70–75%. Leak current was automatically subtracted using a P/4 protocol in pClamp 8.1. From a holding potential of −80 mV, ramp protocols (−80 to +80 mV; 200 ms) were introduced. Recordings were imported into Microcal OriginTM 6.0 for analysis and graphic visualization. We have investigated how BDNF affects the cell surface expression levels of full-length TRKB.TK+ by treating pGFP-TK+-transfected N2a cells and primary hippocampal neurons with 50 ng/ml BDNF for different times. Surface biotinylation assay indicated that BDNF differentially regulates cell surface levels of both transfected and endogenous TK+ depending on the exposure time. A brief 15-s BDNF treatment of TK+-transfected N2a cells at +21 °C resulted in an over 2-fold increase in the surface expression levels of TK+ when compared with the nontreated control cells (Fig.1). BDNF similarly induced a rapid increase in cell surface levels of endogenously expressed TK+ in hippocampal neuron cultures (Fig. 2). A 5-min BDNF treatment, which robustly induces TRKB autophosphorylation in our system (39Haapasalo A. Koponen E. Hoppe E. Wong G. Castrén E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 1352-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), did not increase the surface levels of TK+ in transfected N2a cells or hippocampal neuronal cultures (Figs. 1 and 2). Rather, it resulted in decreased surface levels of endogenously expressed TK+ in neurons (Fig. 2). After 1 h, the TK+ surface levels were significantly decreased in both transfected N2a cells and hippocampal cultures (Figs. 1 and 2), and after 24 h the TK+ signal was barely detectable on the surface of transfected N2a cells (Fig. 1). The total protein levels of TK+ were not significantly altered in transfected N2a cells, even after 24 h of BDNF treatment when compared with the nontreated control cells as indicated by Western blotting (data not shown). This suggests that the changes observed in biotinylation assay represent events taking place on the cell surface only.Figure 2Regulation of endogenously expressed full-length TK+ surface expression levels by BDNF in hippocampal cultures. The cells were treated at 8–10 DIV with 50 ng/ml BDNF for the indicated times. Nontreated cells were used as a control. Surface receptors were biotinylated and precipitated with streptavidin beads, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters. The TRKB bands were detected by using α-TRKBout antibody. The upper panel shows representative images of biotinylated TK+ bands after treatments. The bars show quantified data from at least six independent treatments. The results are shown as percent of nontreated control cells and are expressed as mean intensity of quantified TK+ bands ± S.E. Star indicates statistically significant difference in comparison to control cells (Student's t test, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mechanism by which BDNF increases the rapid TK+ surface expression may involve membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC). A rapid translocation of the GLYT2 glycine transporter to the plasma membrane has been shown to occur in response to depolarization in a Ca2+-dependent manner (49Geerlings A. Nunez E. Lopez-Corcuera B. Aragon C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17584-17590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of depolarization of TK+-transfected N2a cells with 50 mm KCl on the TK+ surface expression. Exposure of cells to KCl for 15 s did not lead to increased surface levels of TK+ compared with the control cells under the same conditions, whereas BDNF did induce a significant increase (Fig. 1). To verify that this lack of response was not due to failure of N2a cells to express VDCCs, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique in voltage mode (47Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15069) Google Scholar) to investigate the functional expression in N2a cells. VDCC currents were evoked by ramp protocols using 20 mm Ba2+ as the current carrier. In 3/6 cells, we observed two components peaking at around −5 and +20 mV, respectively (Fig. 3). The currents were abolished by the introduction of 100 μm Cd2+demonstrating the involvement of Ca2+ currents (data not shown). Substitution of Ba2+ with Ca2+abolished the peak at +20 mV, while only slightly affecting the peak at −5 mV, suggesting the presence LVA and HVA currents (Fig. 3). In other 3/6 cells, we only observed a peak at +20 mV, suggesting the presence of solely HVA currents (data not shown). Thus, N2a cells express VDCC currents. Biotinylation assay was also used to compare the surface expression levels of transfected and endogenous full-length TK+ and truncated T1 in N2a cells and hippocampal cultures. It was observed that the levels of T1 expressed on the cell surface are much greater than those of TK+ (Fig. 4). In transfected N2a cells the surface levels of FLAG- and GFP-tagged TK+ (∼145 and ∼175 kDa, respectively) are clearly lower than those of FLAG- or GFP-tagged T1 (∼95 and ∼125 kDa, respectively; Fig. 4). There were no apparent differences between the surface expression levels of differently tagged (FLAG tag, eight amino acids; GFP tag, ∼30 kDa) TK+ or T1 when compared with each other, even though the differently tagged TRKBs migrate at different molecular weights (Fig.4). However, GFP-T1 migrated as a double band, which may reflect incomplete glycosylation after transient transfection of this construct. In hippocampal neuron cultures, the endogenously expressed TRKB isoforms exhibited similar distribution: the levels of TK+ (∼145 kDa) were lower than those of T1 (∼95 kDa) on the cell surface (Fig.4). This indicates that overexpression of the receptors in N2a cells after transfection does not affect the expressional distribution of the two TRKB isoforms. Confocal microscopy showed that in transfected N2a cells, small amounts of FLAG- and GFP-tagged TK+ were localized to the plasma membrane, but a substantial amount of the protein was located in the cytoplasm around"

Efficient aggrecanase activity requires the presence of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) attached to the aggrecan core protein, implying the contribution of substrate recognition/binding site(s) to ADAMTS-4 activity. In the present study, we demonstrate that full-length ADAMTS-4 (M r∼68,000) undergoes autocatalytic C-terminal truncation to generate two discrete isoforms (M r ∼53,000 and M r ∼40,000), which exhibit a marked reduction in affinity of binding to sulfated GAGs. C-terminal sequencing and mass analyses revealed that the GAG-binding thrombospondin type I motif was retained following autocatalysis, indicating that sites present in the C-terminal cysteine (cys)-rich and/or spacer domains also effect binding of full-length ADAMTS-4 to sulfated GAGs. Binding-competition experiments conducted using native and deglycosylated aggrecan provided direct evidence for interaction of the ADAMTS-4 cysteine-rich/spacer domains with aggrecan GAGs. Furthermore, synthetic peptides mimicking putative (consensus) GAG-binding sequences located within the ADAMTS-4 cysteine-rich and spacer domains competitively blocked binding of sulfated GAGs to full-length ADAMTS-4, thereby identifying multiple GAG-binding sites, which may contribute to the regulation of ADAMTS-4 function.

Unlike most of the MMPs, which are secreted in a state of latency conferred by the cysteine switch region of the retained propeptide (22van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1211) Google Scholar), ADAMTS proteases can be cleaved N-terminally by furin or related pro-protein convertase(s) within the trans-Golgi, resulting in secretion of mature, potentially active enzymes lacking the propeptide region. Interestingly, however, ADAMTS family members such as ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-12 have been shown to undergo proteolytic processing within their C-terminal regions, resulting in removal of domains that can bind to sulfated GAGs (23Rodriguez-Manzaneque J.C.

Pertinent to these observations, efficient aggrecanase activity requires the presence of sulfated GAGs (chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate) attached to the aggrecan core protein (27Tortorella M.

Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that autocatalysis of full-length, furin-processed M r ∼68,000 ADAMTS-4 (ADAMTS-4(p68), Phe213-Lys837) results in C-terminal truncation to generate two discrete isoforms ofM r ∼53,000 (ADAMTS-4(p53)) andM r ∼40,000 (ADAMTS-4(p40)). By identifying the sites of terminal autocatalytic cleavage it was determined that both ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40) retained the TSP motif following removal of varying portions of the C-terminal cysteine-rich and/or spacer domains. However, the affinity of binding to sulfated GAGs was markedly reduced for ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40) relative to ADAMTS-4(p68), indicating that additional C-terminal GAG-interaction site(s) can contribute to matrix/substrate binding and thereby influence ADAMTS-4 activity. Several consensus GAG-binding sequences present in the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich or spacer domains were identified, and competition experiments with corresponding synthetic peptides confirmed the ability of these sites to bind sulfated GAGs. In addition, binding-competition experiments conducted using native and deglycosylated aggrecan provided direct evidence for interaction of the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich/spacer domains with aggrecan GAGs. Full-length recombinant human ADAMTS-4 (Met1-Lys837) was expressed in CHO/A2 cells and purified using Poros HQ and Poros HS ion exchange chromatography media (PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as previously described (29Westling J. Fosang A.J. Last K. Thompson V.P. Tomkinson K.N. Hebert T. McDonagh T. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16059-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). An ADAMTS-4 active site mutant (ASM), generated by point mutation (E362Q) using the QuikChange Site Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), was expressed and purified in the same way. An ADAMTS-4 ASM C-terminal deletion mutant (Met1-Cys574), lacking the cys-rich and spacer domains, and an ADAMTS-4 construct comprised of only the cys-rich and spacer domains (Thr576-Lys837), both containing a C-terminal FLAG epitope tag, were also expressed in CHO/A2 cells and purified from conditioned media using anti-FLAG agarose affinity gel (Sigma). Polyclonal rabbit anti-human ADAMTS-4 antisera L9026, generated using an immunizing mixture of eight distinct synthetic peptides derived from all domains of the enzyme (29Westling J. Fosang A.J. Last K. Thompson V.P. Tomkinson K.N. Hebert T. McDonagh T. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Sandy J.D. J. Biol.

Following protein separation on 10% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), the antibody was used at a concentration of 1.5 μg/ml for Western immunoblotting and detection on Hybond nitrocellulose membranes with ECL reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Bovine articular cartilage D1 aggrecan was prepared from 4 m guanidine HCl extracts and fractionated by equilibrium density centrifugation in cesium chloride as previously described (30Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibody BC-3, which specifically recognizes the N-terminal neoepitope sequence374ARGXX … generated by aggrecanase-mediated cleavage of the Glu373-Ala374 peptide bond with the aggrecan interglobular domain (31Hughes C.E.

Hughes, Cardiff University, UK. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Autocatalytic digestions were performed at 37 °C by incubating purified ADAMTS-4 at concentrations ranging from 10 μg/ml to 400 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.3, containing 5 mmCaCl2 and 0.1–1.0 m NaCl. Following separation by SDS-PAGE, ADAMTS-4 isoforms were visualized by Coomassie blue staining, by silver staining, or by Western immunoblot analysis with the L9026 antibody. Aliquots of autodigested ADAMTS-4 (∼100 pmols) were separated on 10% Bis-Tris NuPAGE SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were stained with Coomassie blue. Excised bands corresponding to ADAMTS-4(p68), ADAMTS-4(p53), and ADAMTS-4(p40) were subjected to automated sequencing on a PE-Biosystems 491A Pulsed-Liquid Sequencer on-line with a PE-Biosystems 140S PTH Analyzer (Procise-HT). Autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms were separated by fractionation on a column of Poros HQ. Unbound ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40) were subsequently fractionated on a column of Poros HS eluted using an isocratic gradient of 0.05–1.0m NaCl in 25 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 5 mmCaCl2, and 5 μm ZnCl2. Mass analyses were performed using a Micromass LCT (LC-TOF-MS) analyzer (Micromass UK, Ltd., Manchester, UK). For C-terminal sequencing samples (∼2 nmol) were concentrated and desalted using ABI ProSorb cartridges. C-terminal sequence analyses were performed at the Mayo Protein Core Facility, Rochester, MN, on an ABI Procise C instrument using thiohydantoin derivitization chemistry (32Boyd V.L. Bozzini M. Zon G. Noble R.L. Mattaliano R.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Bovine aggrecan (30 pmols) was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 25 ng, 50 ng, or 100 ng of purified ADAMTS-4(p40) or ADAMTS-4(p53) in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.3, containing 100 mm NaCl and 5 mmCaCl2. Digestion products were deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC and keratanases and detected by Western immunoblotting with monoclonal antibody BC-3 as previously described (33Hughes C.E. Little C.B.

Affinity blotting with biotinylated heparin (bHep; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), a commercially available (labeled) sulfated GAG, was performed essentially as described by Melrose et al. (36Melrose J. Numata Y. Ghosh P. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) for the detection of hyaluronan-binding proteins using biotinylated hyaluronan. Purified ADAMTS-4 and autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms were separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. All incubations were carried out in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mNaCl, and bHep was used at a concentration of 0.05 μg/ml. bHep binding was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (0.5 μg/ml) (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) and visualized using nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) substrate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms were also separated using a heparin-Sepharose affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with a stepwise gradient of 0.1–1.0 m NaCl in 10 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.0. For binding-competition experiments, membranes were preincubated for 1 h with unlabelled heparin (0.5−50 μg/ml) prior to affinity blotting detection as described above. Similar competition experiments were performed by preincubating membranes in the presence of native bovine aggrecan or with aggrecan that had been deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase, and keratanase II as described (35Little C.B. Hughes C.E. Curtis C.L. Janusz M.J. Bohne R. Wang-Weigand S. Taiwo Y.O. Mitchell P.G. Otterness I.G. Flannery C.R. Caterson B. Matrix Biol. 2002; 21: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In other binding-competition studies, synthetic peptides containing putative GAG-binding sequences, which are present in the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich or spacer domains, were used to investigate the capacity for these sites to bind sulfated GAGs. The peptides examined (consensus GAG-binding sequences are underlined) were GSKKKFDKCM from the cys-rich domain and SFRKFRYG from the spacer domain (consensus heparin-binding sequences) (37Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and LRRRPWAGRKfrom the spacer domain (consensus hyaluronan-binding sequence) (38Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). To avoid oxidation, lyophilyzed peptides were dissolved as stock solutions in high pressure liquid chromatography-grade water immediately prior to testing. Peptides (diluted to 1 mg/ml or 3 mg/ml) were then preincubated with bHep for 1 h prior to affinity blotting detection. A variant (control) peptide (RASCETP) or a polycation (poly-l-lysine HCl) were also tested to verify binding specificity. Purified recombinant human ADAMTS-4 migrated on SDS-PAGE gels as a predominantM r ∼68,000 protein (Fig.1), the aggrecanolytic properties of which have previously been reported (29Westling J. Fosang A.J. Last K. Thompson V.P. Tomkinson K.N. Hebert T. McDonagh T. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16059-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 37 °C for various times up to 16 h, ADAMTS-4 was detected as isoforms of M r ∼68,000 (ADAMTS-4(p68)),M r ∼53,000 (ADAMTS-4(p53)), andM r ∼40,000 (ADAMTS-4(p40)) (Fig. 1). We next performed parallel incubations of ADAMTS-4 wild type (WT) and an ADAMTS-4 active site mutant (ASM). Following incubation at 37 °C for 16 h, ADAMTS-4 WT was detected as theM r ∼68,000, ∼53,000, and ∼40,000 isoforms as previously observed. The ADAMTS-4 ASM, however, was detected only as the M r ∼68,000 isoform, both before and after incubation, demonstrating that the observed processing of ADAMTS-4 WT was due to autocatalytic cleavage and not a contaminating protease (Fig. 2). N-terminal sequence analysis of ADAMTS-4(p68), ADAMTS-4(p53), and ADAMTS-4(p40) revealed that each isoform initiated at Phe213 as expected for furin-processed ADAMTS-4 (7Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A. Copeland R.A. Deccico C.P. Wynn R. Rockwell A. Yang F. Duke J.L. Solomon K. George H. Bruckner R. Nagase H. Itoh Y. Ellis D.M. Ross H. Wiswall B.H. Murphy K. Hillman M.C. Hollis G.F. Newton R.C. Magolda R.L. Trzaskos J.M. Arner E.C. Science. 1999; 284: 1664-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar), indicating that ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40) were generated by C-terminal truncation (see Fig.3). Full-length, furin-processed ADAMTS-4 (i.e. Phe213-Lys837) has a calculated mass, based on amino acid content, of 67,943 Da, consistent with the observed size of ADAMTS-4(p68). The measured mass of ADAMTS-4(p53), as determined by LC-TOF-MS, was 52,356 Da, and a C-terminal sequence corresponding to -Phe-Arg-Lys694 was detected for this isoform. A C-terminal sequence corresponding to -Ser-Ala-Leu-Thr581 was detected for ADAMTS-4(p40), and the measured mass of this isoform was 40,040 Da. The typical mass accuracy expected for the Micromass LCT MS instrument utilized is up to 0.1% of the mass of the protein. Based on amino acid content, the calculated mass for ADAMTS-4(p53) is 52,180 Da (i.e. for Phe213-Lys694) and that of ADAMTS-4(p40) is 39,757 Da (for Phe213-Thr581). Thus, the variabilities observed in measured versuscalculated mass, i.e. 0.3% for ADAMTS-4(p53) and 0.7% for ADAMTS-4(p40), may reflect the likely occurrence (39Larsen M.R. Roepstorff P. Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 2000; 366: 677-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) of minor post-translational or chemical modification(s) (i.e.adduction with metal ions), which could occur during ADAMTS-4 synthesis/purification. Although the autocatalytic cleavage sites identified (i.e.Lys694-Phe695 and Thr581-Phe582; see Fig. 3) are at variance with the characteristic glutamyl endopeptidase (aggrecanase) activity of ADAMTS-4, it has recently been shown that ADAMTS-4 can cleave secondarily at the MMP site (Asn341-Phe342) in the aggrecan interglobular domain (29Westling J. Fosang A.J. Last K. Thompson V.P. Tomkinson K.N. Hebert T. McDonagh T. Collins-Racie L.A. LaVallie E.R. Morris E.A. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16059-16066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), demonstrating further the potential for hydrolysis of diverse peptide bonds by ADAMTS-4. Structurally, both autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms (p53 and p43) retained the GAG-binding TSP type I motif but lacked varying portions of the cys-rich and/or spacer domains (Fig. 3), a region that, for ADAMTS-1, has also been shown to bind to extracellular matrix GAGs (40Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we did not detect the C-terminal products that were anticipated to be generated by ADAMTS-4 autocatalytic cleavage (i.e. fragments of the cys-rich/spacer domains corresponding to Phe582-Lys694, Phe695-Lys837, and/or Phe582-Lys837, and ranging in size fromM r ∼12,000 to M r∼28,000), suggesting that further proteolytic processing occurred under the incubation conditions employed in this study. Incubations performed using ADAMTS-4 at concentrations ranging from 10 μg/ml to 400 μg/ml gave essentially identical patterns of digestion (Fig.4 A), suggesting that ADAMTS-4 autoprocessing occurs predominantly via an intramolecular mechanism. Similarly, there was little evidence for significant intermolecular processing of a FLAG-tagged protein construct representing the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich/spacer domains (comprising Thr576-Lys837, and thus containing the autocatalytic cleavage sites Lys694-Phe695 and Thr581-Phe582) following incubation with increasing amounts of active ADAMTS-4 (Fig. 4 B). Bovine aggrecan was incubated with purified ADAMTS-4(p40) and ADAMTS-4(p53), and digestion products were analyzed for evidence of aggrecanase activity by Western immunoblotting using monoclonal antibody BC-3. Both autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms exhibited enzymatic activity at enzyme/substrate ratios ranging from 1:48 to 1:12 for ADAMTS-4(p40) (Fig.5, lanes 1–3), and 1:63 to 1:16 for ADAMTS-4(p53) (Fig. 5, lanes 4–6). No BC-3 immunoreactivity was detected for aggrecan incubated in the absence of ADAMTS-4 enzyme (Fig. 5, lane 7). Autocatalytic digests of ADAMTS-4 were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by silver staining (Fig. 6 A) and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 6 B) to confirm the presence of ADAMTS-4(p68), ADAMTS-4(p53), and ADAMTS-4(p40). Affinity blotting experiments revealed that although ADAMTS-4(p68) (WT or ASM) bound biotinylated heparin in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, no such binding was observed for ADAMTS-4(p53) or ADAMTS-4(p40) (Fig.6 C). Likewise, an ADAMTS-4 ASM C-terminal deletion mutant (Phe213-Cys574), lacking the cys-rich and spacer domains, did not bind bHep under these conditions (results not shown). The autocatalytically generated ADAMTS-4 isoforms did bind to a column of heparin-Sepharose, however, ADAMTS-4(p68) bound with significantly higher affinity, eluting from the column in the presence of 0.8 m NaCl compared with 0.3 m-0.4m NaCl for ADAMTS-4(p40) and ADAMTS-4(p53) (Fig.6 D). In binding-competition experiments, preincubation of affinity blot membranes with unlabelled heparin blocked binding of bHep to ADAMTS-4(p68) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.7 A, panels 1–3). Furthermore, preincubation of membranes in the presence of native aggrecan blocked binding of bHep to ADAMTS-4(p68), whereas deglycosylated aggrecan failed to compete (Fig. 7 A,panels 4 and 5), demonstrating interaction of aggrecan GAGs with the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich/spacer domains. Preincubation of bHep in the presence of synthetic peptides containing putative GAG-binding sequences present in the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich/spacer domains (GSKKKFDKCM, SFRKFRYG, and LRRRPWAGRK; consensus GAG-binding sequences are underlined; see Fig. 3 B) also blocked the binding of bHep to ADAMTS-4(p68) (Fig. 7 B, panels 1–3). Neither an unrelated (control) peptide nor poly-l-lysine inhibited bHep binding (Fig. 7 B, panels 4 and5), thus confirming the identification of multiple GAG-binding sites within the C-terminal region of ADAMTS-4. Reduction of ADAMTS-4(p68) by treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol did prevent bHep binding (Fig. 7 B, panel 7), demonstrating the importance of secondary protein structure in this process. A defining feature of ADAMTS proteases is the presence of one or more TSP type I motifs (or submotifs) that can bind to extracellular matrix GAGs. In the case of ADAMTS-4, the TSP motif is required for binding to aggrecan (via its GAG chains) and cleavage of this substrate (27Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). For ADAMTS-1, however, sites within the C-terminal spacer domain also bind sulfated GAGs (40Kuno K. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13912-13917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and we herein describe similar findings for ADAMTS-4. Autocatalytic C-terminal truncation of full-length ADAMTS-4 (ADAMTS-4(p68)) generated two discrete isoforms (see Fig. 1), ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40), which exhibited markedly reduced affinity of binding to heparin (Fig. 6). Because both of the truncated isoforms retained the TSP type I motif (see Fig. 3), it was evident that additional sites located within the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich and/or spacer domains can contribute to GAG binding. In competition experiments, native aggrecan blocked binding of bHep to ADAMTS-4(p68), whereas deglycosylated aggrecan did not (Fig. 7 A,panels 4 and 5, respectively), thereby demonstrating interaction of the ADAMTS-4 cys-rich/spacer domains with aggrecan GAGs. Several potential GAG-binding sites are represented in the cys-rich and spacer domains. For example, two consensus heparin-binding sequences,i.e. XBBBXXBX andXBBXBX, where B represents a basic amino acid and X designates any other residue (37Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), are present (668SKKKFDKC675 and692FRKFRY697; underlined in Fig.3 B). Although the former sequence is retained in ADAMTS-4(p53), both sequences are lacking in ADAMTS-4(p40), and this could contribute to differences in GAG-binding affinity (see Figs. 3and 6). Also present at the extreme C terminus of full-length ADAMTS-4 is a consensus GAG-binding B(X7)B motif (829RRRPWAGRK837; underlined in Fig.3 B). The B(X7)B motif, wherein B represents arginine or lysine and X7 contains no acidic residues and at least one basic amino acid, has been described as a hyaluronan-binding sequence present in proteins such as CD44, receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), and link protein (38Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Linear peptides mimicking the putative GAG-binding sequences described above competitively inhibited the binding of ADAMTS-4(p68) to bHep, whereas an unrelated (control) peptide or poly-l-lysine did not (Fig. 7 B). However, although it appears that these sequences do indeed represent potential GAG-binding sites, it is noteworthy that secondary structure of ADAMTS-4(p68) is critical for optimal binding to sulfated GAGs because treatment of the protein with reducing agents significantly diminishes the affinity for bHep (Fig.7 B). Physiological mechanisms for ADAMTS activation and inhibition clearly represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention of pathological activity. For ADAMTS-4, C-terminal truncation appears to be a process that may regulate (activate) proteolytic activity (26Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D. Gottschall P.E. Sandy J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11034-11041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and in the present study we provide evidence that C-terminal truncation of ADAMTS-4 can also modulate (reduce) GAG-binding affinity. Thus, it may be envisioned that the loss of GAG-binding site(s) present in the cys-rich/spacer domains results in the mobilization of truncated ADAMTS-4 isoforms, facilitating access to proteolytically sensitive sites within the aggrecan core protein. Consequently, proteolytic aggrecanase activity would be preserved if the critical GAG-binding TSP motif (27Tortorella M. Pratta M. Liu R.Q. Abbaszade I. Ross H. Burn T. Arner E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25791-25797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was retained by such ADAMTS-4 isoforms, as in the case of ADAMTS-4(p53) and ADAMTS-4(p40). Significantly, truncated forms of ADAMTS-4, which are similar in size to C-terminally processed isoforms derived from recombinant proteins (Ref. 26Gao G. Westling J. Thompson V.P. Howell T.D.

Although it remains to be determined whether such ADAMTS-4 isoforms are generated solely by C-terminal truncation, and whether by autocatalysis and/or catabolism by other proteases, modulation of GAG-binding properties by such processes appears to occur in vivo and is likely to be influential in affecting ADAMTS-4 activity.

https://openalex.org/W2044175451,"Exposure to hypoxia causes structural changes in the endothelial cell layer that alter its permeability and its interaction with leukocytes and platelets. One of the well characterized cytoskeletal changes in response to stress involves the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of stress fibers. This report describes cytoskeletal changes in pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in response to hypoxia and potential mechanisms involved in this process. The hypoxia-induced actin redistribution appears to be mediated by components downstream of MAPK p38, which is activated in pulmonary endothelial cells in response to hypoxia. Our results indicate that kinase MK2, which is a substrate of p38, becomes activated by hypoxia, leading to the phosphorylation of one of its substrates, HSP27. Because HSP27 phosphorylation is known to alter actin distribution in response to other stimuli, we postulate that it also causes the actin redistribution observed in hypoxia. This notion is supported by the observations that similar actin redistribution occurs in cells overexpressing constitutively active MK2 or phosphomimicking HSP27 mutant. Overexpressing dominant negative MK2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on the actin cytoskeleton. Taken together these results indicate that hypoxia stimulates the p38-MK2-HSP27 pathway leading to significant alteration in the actin cytoskeleton."

We have defined a novel synergistic, as opposed to antagonistic, combinatorial interaction between GATA-1 and PU.1, and a unique repressor role for certain C/EBPε isoforms in the transcriptional regulation of a model eosinophil granulocyte gene, the major basic protein (MBP). The eosinophil-specific P2 promoter of the MBP gene contains GATA-1, C/EBP, and PU.1 consensus sites that bind these factors in nuclear extracts of the eosinophil myelocyte cell line, AML14.3D10. The promoter is transactivated by GATA-1 alone but is synergistically transactivated by low levels of PU.1 in the context of optimal levels of GATA-1. The C/EBPε27 isoform strongly represses GATA-1 activity and completely blocks GATA-1/PU.1 synergy. In vitro mutational analyses of the MBP-P2 promoter showed that both the GATA-1/PU.1 synergy, and repressor activity of C/EBPε27 are mediated via protein-protein interactions through the C/EBP and/or GATA-binding sites but not the PU.1 sites.

PU.1 expression increases gradually through the myelocytic stages of hematopoietic development and then remains relatively constant through terminal differentiation (26Scott E.W. Fisher R.C.

Thus, PU.1 is a critical regulator of hematopoietic gene transcription that possesses multiple and varied roles at different stages of both lymphoid and myeloid development. The CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), members of leucine zipper transcription factor family, include six members to date, of which four (C/EBPα, -β, -δ, and -ε) are expressed in the myeloid lineages and play key roles in hematopoiesis and/or functional maturation of these cells, and two (C/EBPγ and -ζ) lack transactivation domains and act as dominant negative repressors of transcription (40Lekstrom-Himes J.

Disruption of the C/EBPε gene blocks the terminal differentiation of granulocytes, including impaired production of eosinophils (4Yamanaka R. Barlow C. Lekstrom-Himes J. Castilla L.H. Liu P.P.

The C/EBPε27 isoform contains DNA binding, dimerization, transactivation, and possible repression domains, whereas C/EBPε14 is the only isoform that lacks a transactivation domain.

Nishio H. Kishi K. Ackerman S.J. Suda T. Blood. 1999; 94: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which we demonstrated synergy between these factors in the transactivation of the MBP promoter. Regulation of an eosinophil-specific gene (EOS47) by the combinatorial actions of C/EBPβ, ets-1, and GATA-1 has also been reported for the avian system (2McNagny K.M. Sieweke M.H. Doderlein G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have further characterized the eosinophil-specific MBP-P2 promoter, identifying novel combinatorial interactions among GATA-1, PU.1, and the C/EBPε27 isoform that result in either synergistic activation or transcriptional repression. Human MBP, one of the principal mediators of inflammation and tissue damage in eosinophil-associated allergic responses, is expressed by eosinophils (66Ackerman S.J. Loegering D.A. Venge P. Olsson I. Harley J.B. Fauci A.S. Gleich G.J. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 2977-2982PubMed Google Scholar), and to a lesser extent by basophils (67Ackerman S.J. Kephart G.M. Habermann T.M. Greipp P.R. Gleich G.J. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 946-961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a proform of MBP is elaborated by placental trophoblasts during gestation (68Wasmoen T.L. McKean D.J. Benirschke K. Coulam C.B.

Sun L. Satoh T. Fisher L.M. Spry C.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Eosinophils and basophils transcribe principally from the P2 promoter, whereas the P1 promoter predominates in placental cells (8Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 70Li M.S. Sun L. Satoh T. Fisher L.M. Spry C.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We identified previously a major functional region for the MBP-P2 promoter between bp −117 and −67 (8Yamaguchi Y. Ackerman S.J. Minegishi N. Takiguchi M. Yamamoto M. Suda T. Blood. 1998; 91: 3447-3458Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Yamaguchi Y. Nishio H. Kishi K. Ackerman S.J. Suda T. Blood. 1999; 94: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present studies, a more extensive consensus binding site analysis showed that the bp −117 to +1 region of the promoter contains not one but two adjacent GATA-binding sites, two C/EBP sites, and two previously unidentified PU.1 sites, suggesting that the combinatorial activities of all three of these factors are involved in MBP gene transcription. Because PU.1 has been reported to antagonize GATA-1-mediated erythroid gene expression and development (10Rekhtman N. Radparvar F. Evans T. Skoultchi A.I. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1398-1411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Zhang P. Behre G. Pan J. Iwama A. Wara-Aswapati N. Radomska H.S. Auron P.E. Tenen D.G. Sun Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 2000; 95: 2543-2551Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and we have shown that GATA-1 is a key regulator of the MBP gene, we utilized the MBP-P2 promoter as a model to characterize further the combinatorial interactions and roles of GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPε in the eosinophil lineage. Consensus sites in the functional region of the MBP-P2 promoter were evaluated for their ability to bind GATA, PU.1, or C/EBP family members using nuclear extracts from the MBP-expressing eosinophil myelocyte cell line, AML14.3D10, and mature peripheral blood eosinophils. The functional relevance of these binding sites and transcription factor interactions were evaluated using mutagenesis, transactivation analyses in CV-1 cells, and transient transfection analyses in AML14.3D10 eosinophils. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were performed to confirm the in vivo physical interactions of GATA-1, PU.1, and the various C/EBPε isoforms in eosinophil cell lines and mature peripheral blood eosinophils. Our results show that GATA-1, PU.1, and the various C/EBPε isoforms are differentially expressed, and physically and functionally interact during human eosinophil development to activate and then repress eosinophil gene transcription. In contrast to the functional antagonism reported for PU.1 and GATA-1 for activation of the M-CSFR promoter and various erythroid genes, we show that these factors cooperate synergistically in the activation of the eosinophil MBP-P2 promoter. Importantly, we demonstrate that PU.1 expression levels relative to GATA-1 determine whether the GATA-1/PU.1 interaction leads to synergy for GATA-1-regulated eosinophil target genes such as MBP. Moreover, we identify a novel role for the C/EBPε27 isoform as a repressor of GATA-1-mediated transactivation and GATA-1/PU.1 synergy. Finally, co-IP analyses demonstrate for the first time that the C/EBPε32/30 and C/EBPε27 isoforms physically interact with both PU.1 and GATA-1 in vivo, in eosinophils. Our findings demonstrate key combinatorial interactions of GATA-1, PU.1, and C/EBPε isoforms that may mediate either synergy or antagonism (repression) of granulocyte (eosinophil) gene transcription during myeloid development and terminal differentiation. Human blood eosinophils were isolated from a unit (475 ml) of blood obtained from normal, non-allergic, healthy donors. The use of normal human subjects as blood donors was in full compliance with all federal guidelines and was approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Review Board. Eosinophil isolation and purification were performed as described previously (71Du J. Alsayed Y.M. Xin F. Ackerman S.J. Platanias L.C. J. Biol.

Eosinophil preparations of >99% purity were routinely obtained and utilized for these studies. The human AML14.3D10 cell line is a fully differentiated eosinophil myelocyte line that contains eosinophil secondary (specific) granules and displays many characteristics of mature peripheral blood eosinophils. These include expression of the secondary granule cationic proteins major basic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and eosinophil cationic protein (72Paul C.C. Mahrer S.

https://openalex.org/W2028253068,"We have shown previously that the muscarinic agonist, carbachol (CCh), transactivates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) via calmodulin, Pyk-2, and Src kinase activation. EGFr phosphorylation causes extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and inhibits CCh-stimulated chloride secretion across intestinal epithelial cells. Here we investigated whether CCh-stimulated EGFr transactivation involves EGFr ligand release. Pre-incubation of T84 cell monolayers with a neutralizing antibody to the EGFr ligand binding domain decreased CCh-induced phosphorylation of EGFr and ERK. CCh-stimulated efflux of86Rb+ from T84 cell monolayers, which parallels changes in chloride secretion, was potentiated by anti-EGFr pre-incubation. Anti-EGFr did not reduce CCh-stimulated Pyk-2 phosphorylation. Co-incubation with the Src kinase inhibitor PP2 and anti-EGFr had an additive inhibitory effect on CCh-induced ERK phosphorylation greater than either inhibitor alone. CCh caused the basolateral release of transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) into T84 cell bathing media. A metalloproteinase inhibitor, WAY171318, reduced CCh-induced phosphorylation of ERK and completely blocked EGFr phosphorylation and TGF-α release. We conclude that CCh-stimulated EGFr transactivation and subsequent ERK activation, a pathway that limits CCh-induced chloride secretion, is mediated by metalloproteinase-dependent extracellular release of TGF-α and intracellular Src activation. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the role of growth factors in regulating epithelial ion secretion."

In vertebrates, neuronal AChRs are composed of subunits α2-α10 and β2-β4 (for review, see Ref. 1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). AChR subunits have a large cytoplasmic domain between their third and fourth transmembrane domain whose amino acid sequence is highly divergent among the various subunits (2Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The full functional unit of AChRs, like those of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (3Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), is likely to include proteins that associate with this large cytoplasmic domain and modulate AChR functions.To identify proteins associated with α4 AChRs, we used bait consisting of the large cytoplasmic domain of the α4 subunit to screen a mouse brain cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. In this paper, we describe the isolation of VILIP-1, a member of the visinin-like protein family of calcium sensor proteins, by such a screen. VILIP-1 is a member of a superfamily of neuronal calcium sensor proteins. This superfamily has been classified into the five subfamilies termed group I-V. The recoverins belong to group I, the frequenins and neuronal calcium sensor (NCS-1) to group II, the VILIPs, hippocalcin, and neurocalcins to group III, NCS-2 to group IV, and guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins and GC-inhibiting proteins to group V (for review, see Ref. 4Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar).The VILIP family is comprised of three members, VILIP-1, VILIP-2, and VILIP-3 (5Kajimoto Y. Shirai Y.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The members of this family contain 4 EF-hand motifs, of which only EF-hand 2, 3, and 4 are thought to be functional because EF-hand 1 lacks two oxygen-containing side chain residues crucial for binding calcium. A glycine residue at the second position on the polypeptide chain is myristoylated. Interestingly, within most, but not all members of this calcium sensor protein family, the myristoyl moiety is sequestered and exposed through a rapid conformational change that unmasks it in response to alterations in cellular levels of calcium, thus facilitating its association with membranes (11Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This calcium-dependent conformational switch has been termed the “calcium-myristoyl switch.”In this paper we show that VILIP-1 interacts with both native and recombinant α4β2 AChRs. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs increased their surface expression ∼2-fold. This effect was significantly diminished for VILIP-1 mutants that are deficient in their ability to be myristoylated or bind calcium. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs also increased their agonist-sensitivity ∼3-fold. Collectively, these results support a novel role for VILIP-1 as an AChR-associated protein that modulates the surface expression levels and functional properties of α4β2 AChRs in response to changes in the intracellular levels of calcium.DISCUSSIONIt is becoming increasingly evident that calcium binding and calcium sensor proteins play a significant role in coupling changes in intracellular levels of calcium to modulation of different types of voltage- and ligand-gated channels. Recently, different members of the superfamily of calcium sensor proteins such as KChIP (18An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W.

Similarly, modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels by NCS-1 was recently reported (24Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another calcium-binding protein, calmodulin, has a well established role in regulating the functional properties of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (25Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P., Su, C.T.

Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, despite the well recognized permeability of neuronal AChRs to calcium, it is not known if AChRs are also regulated by calcium sensor proteins.In a broad yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify cytosolic proteins that interact with α4 AChRs, we discovered the protein VILIP-1. In this paper we presented experimental evidence for the modulation of α4β2 AChRs by the calcium sensor protein VILIP-1. VILIP-1 coimmunoprecipitates with both recombinant and native α4β2 AChRs and shows partial colocalization with native α4 subunits in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with α4β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells increases the surface expression of α4β2 AChRs ∼2-fold. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs increases their agonist sensitivity ∼3-fold. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which changes in intracellular levels of calcium can alter the expression levels and functional properties of AChRs.The surface expression of α4 AChRs can be modulated by different mechanisms. The binding of nicotine to α4 AChRs up-regulates their surface expression levels both in vitro (20Gopalakrishnan M. Molinari E.J. Sullivan J.P. Mol.

The exact mechanism by which the association of VILIP-1 with α4β2 AChRs increases their surface expression remains to be established. However, we have provided experimental evidence that the previously reported ability of recombinant VILIP-1 to increase basal levels of cAMP or the coupled PKA activity is not responsible for the increase in α4β2 AChR surface expression. This is because we observe that VILIP-1 increases the surface expression of α4β2 AChR even in cells that have been pretreated with forskolin and in cells that have been pretreated with the PKA inhibitor H-89. Because we observe little detectable colocalization of VILIP-1 with α4 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes, it is unlikely that VILIP-1 is involved in the trafficking of α4 AChRs to the surface membrane. The colocalization at the surface membrane instead favors the possibility that VILIP-1 alters the turnover of α4 AChRs at the surface membrane when it associates with them after the activation of its calcium-myristoyl switch and translocation to the membrane in response to changes in intracellular levels of calcium. The ability of VILIP-1 to increase the surface expression of membrane proteins it associates with is conserved among other members of this superfamily because KChIP also increases the surface density of A-type K+ channels (18An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar).The VILIP-1 mutants lacking the myristoyl moiety and the functional EF-hand motifs were attenuated in their ability to modulate the α4β2 AChR response. This was inferred from the Hill fits that gave significantly lower n H for both single-site and two-site fits, suggesting that the heterogeneous responses were from modulated and unmodulated α4β2 AChRs, possibly because of the loss in each of the VILIP-1 mutant's affinity for the α4β2 AChR. We observed that ACh activated α4β2 AChR coexpressed with mVILIP-2,3,4EF with an EC50 that was significantly lower than the EC50 for activating α4β2 AChR coexpressed with mVILIP-myr. We have recently observed that mVILIP-myr is poorly associated with membranes even in the presence of calcium in contrast to the association of mVILIP-2,3,4EF with membranes both in the presence and absence of calcium (13Lin L. Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Anand R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), possibly because the myristoyl moiety is constitutive exposed due to structural changes caused by mutations in the EF-hand motifs. Based on these results we concluded that the calcium binding EF-hand motifs of VILIP-1 have a structural role in triggering the calcium-myristoyl switch of VILIP-1, but its ability to remain associated with membranes critically requires the presence of the myristoyl moiety. Thus, the differences between the EC50 values for activation of the α4β2 AChR coexpressed with the two VILIP-1 mutants most likely reflected individual differences in their ability to associate with membranes (loss for mVILIP-myr and retention for mVILIP-2,3,4EF).Neuronal AChRs in the central nervous system are the primary mediators of addiction to nicotine. Addiction to nicotine due to repetitive activation of AChRs is thought to change the functional properties of the AChRs themselves and the functional circuitry of the central nervous system by a complex sequence of molecular and cellular processes similar to those activated by other drugs of addiction (36Koob G.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 177-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 37Koob G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 893-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Koob G.F. Nestler E.J. J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Because AChRs exhibit significant permeability to calcium, it is reasonable to expect that some of these changes are effected via calcium entry through nicotine-gated AChRs. It was recently demonstrated that chronic low doses of nicotine can also up-regulate recombinant α4β2 AChR function by increasing their agonist sensitivity (39Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this result was attributed to a possible interaction of α4β2 AChRs with cytosolic proteins in the host cells (39Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the endogenous intracellular proteins that can increase the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs. The ability of VILIP-1 to increase the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs could account for the observations of that chronic nicotine alters α4β2 AChR function. The increased agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs may represent one mechanism by which chronic exposure to low doses of nicotine (as occurs in the central nervous system neurons of nicotine addicts) augments synaptic transmission involving α4β2 AChRs where they, in turn, modulate the release of multiple neurotransmitters including dopamine.The illustration in Fig. 8 shows a model that incorporates key features of our findings. In this model, repetitive exposure to nicotine would increase calcium entry into neurons due to activation of nicotine-gated AChRs, which in turn would trigger the calcium-myristoyl switch of VILIP-1 and cause it to translocate to the membrane in the vicinity of activated AChRs. The association of VILIP-1 with the AChRs would have two consequences, 1) to increase AChR levels possibly by decreasing their turnover and 2) to stabilize them in a state with higher agonist sensitivity. It is possible that behaviors that lead to accumulation of AChRs in this state, including smoking tobacco, become reinforced because of subsequent functional adaptations of neural networks to functioning with AChRs that have higher agonist sensitivity.We have previously demonstrated that a chaperone protein identified as 14-3-3 has a dynamic role in regulating the expression levels of α4β2 AChRs through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the α4 subunit (15Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.M. Jayaraman A. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, an endogenous prototoxin identified as lynx1 was shown to decrease the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs and slow their recovery from desensitization (40Ibanez-Tallon I. Miwa J.M. Wang H.L. Adams N.C. Crabtree G.W. Sine S.M. Heintz N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ability of VILIP-1 to modulate both the surface expression and the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs adds it a growing list of accessory proteins that associate with neuronal AChRs and modulate their biogenesis and functions. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs)1 are members of a gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. In vertebrates, neuronal AChRs are composed of subunits α2-α10 and β2-β4 (for review, see Ref. 1Sargent P.B. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 16: 403-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). AChR subunits have a large cytoplasmic domain between their third and fourth transmembrane domain whose amino acid sequence is highly divergent among the various subunits (2Lindstrom J. Ion Channels. 1996; 4: 377-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The full functional unit of AChRs, like those of theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (3Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar), is likely to include proteins that associate with this large cytoplasmic domain and modulate AChR functions. To identify proteins associated with α4 AChRs, we used bait consisting of the large cytoplasmic domain of the α4 subunit to screen a mouse brain cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. In this paper, we describe the isolation of VILIP-1, a member of the visinin-like protein family of calcium sensor proteins, by such a screen. VILIP-1 is a member of a superfamily of neuronal calcium sensor proteins. This superfamily has been classified into the five subfamilies termed group I-V. The recoverins belong to group I, the frequenins and neuronal calcium sensor (NCS-1) to group II, the VILIPs, hippocalcin, and neurocalcins to group III, NCS-2 to group IV, and guanylyl cyclase-activating proteins and GC-inhibiting proteins to group V (for review, see Ref. 4Braunewell K.H. Gundelfinger E.D. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The VILIP family is comprised of three members, VILIP-1, VILIP-2, and VILIP-3 (5Kajimoto Y. Shirai Y. Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka C. J. Neurochem. 1993; 61: 1091-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 6Kato M. Watanabe Y. Iino S. Takaoka Y. Kobayashi S. Haga T. Hidaka H. Biochem.

Genomics. 1995; 29: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The members of this family contain 4 EF-hand motifs, of which only EF-hand 2, 3, and 4 are thought to be functional because EF-hand 1 lacks two oxygen-containing side chain residues crucial for binding calcium. A glycine residue at the second position on the polypeptide chain is myristoylated. Interestingly, within most, but not all members of this calcium sensor protein family, the myristoyl moiety is sequestered and exposed through a rapid conformational change that unmasks it in response to alterations in cellular levels of calcium, thus facilitating its association with membranes (11Ames J.B. Tanaka T. Stryer L. Ikura M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 12Ames J.B. Ishima R. Tanaka T. Gordon J.I. Stryer L. Ikura M. Nature. 1997; 389: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). This calcium-dependent conformational switch has been termed the “calcium-myristoyl switch.” In this paper we show that VILIP-1 interacts with both native and recombinant α4β2 AChRs. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs increased their surface expression ∼2-fold. This effect was significantly diminished for VILIP-1 mutants that are deficient in their ability to be myristoylated or bind calcium. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs also increased their agonist-sensitivity ∼3-fold. Collectively, these results support a novel role for VILIP-1 as an AChR-associated protein that modulates the surface expression levels and functional properties of α4β2 AChRs in response to changes in the intracellular levels of calcium. DISCUSSIONIt is becoming increasingly evident that calcium binding and calcium sensor proteins play a significant role in coupling changes in intracellular levels of calcium to modulation of different types of voltage- and ligand-gated channels. Recently, different members of the superfamily of calcium sensor proteins such as KChIP (18An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), frequenin (22Nakamura T.Y. Pountney D.J. Ozaita A. Nandi S. Ueda S. Rudy B. Coetzee W.A. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26436-26443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were shown to modulate the A-type K+channels. Similarly, modulation of voltage-gated calcium channels by NCS-1 was recently reported (24Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Another calcium-binding protein, calmodulin, has a well established role in regulating the functional properties of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (25Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P., Su, C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26Ehlers M.D. Zhang S. Bernhadt J.P. Huganir R.L.

Neuron. 1994; 12: 1301-1318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 28DeMaria C.D. Soong T.W. Alseikhan B.A. Alvania R.S. Yue D.T. Nature. 2001; 411: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). However, despite the well recognized permeability of neuronal AChRs to calcium, it is not known if AChRs are also regulated by calcium sensor proteins.In a broad yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify cytosolic proteins that interact with α4 AChRs, we discovered the protein VILIP-1. In this paper we presented experimental evidence for the modulation of α4β2 AChRs by the calcium sensor protein VILIP-1. VILIP-1 coimmunoprecipitates with both recombinant and native α4β2 AChRs and shows partial colocalization with native α4 subunits in cultured cerebellar granule cells. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with α4β2 AChRs in tsA201 cells increases the surface expression of α4β2 AChRs ∼2-fold. Coexpression of VILIP-1 with recombinant α4β2 AChRs increases their agonist sensitivity ∼3-fold. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which changes in intracellular levels of calcium can alter the expression levels and functional properties of AChRs.The surface expression of α4 AChRs can be modulated by different mechanisms. The binding of nicotine to α4 AChRs up-regulates their surface expression levels both in vitro (20Gopalakrishnan M. Molinari E.J. Sullivan J.P. Mol.

Because we observe little detectable colocalization of VILIP-1 with α4 subunits in the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membranes, it is unlikely that VILIP-1 is involved in the trafficking of α4 AChRs to the surface membrane. The colocalization at the surface membrane instead favors the possibility that VILIP-1 alters the turnover of α4 AChRs at the surface membrane when it associates with them after the activation of its calcium-myristoyl switch and translocation to the membrane in response to changes in intracellular levels of calcium. The ability of VILIP-1 to increase the surface expression of membrane proteins it associates with is conserved among other members of this superfamily because KChIP also increases the surface density of A-type K+ channels (18An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The VILIP-1 mutants lacking the myristoyl moiety and the functional EF-hand motifs were attenuated in their ability to modulate the α4β2 AChR response. This was inferred from the Hill fits that gave significantly lower n H for both single-site and two-site fits, suggesting that the heterogeneous responses were from modulated and unmodulated α4β2 AChRs, possibly because of the loss in each of the VILIP-1 mutant's affinity for the α4β2 AChR. We observed that ACh activated α4β2 AChR coexpressed with mVILIP-2,3,4EF with an EC50 that was significantly lower than the EC50 for activating α4β2 AChR coexpressed with mVILIP-myr. We have recently observed that mVILIP-myr is poorly associated with membranes even in the presence of calcium in contrast to the association of mVILIP-2,3,4EF with membranes both in the presence and absence of calcium (13Lin L. Braunewell K.-H. Gundelfinger E.D. Anand R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), possibly because the myristoyl moiety is constitutive exposed due to structural changes caused by mutations in the EF-hand motifs. Based on these results we concluded that the calcium binding EF-hand motifs of VILIP-1 have a structural role in triggering the calcium-myristoyl switch of VILIP-1, but its ability to remain associated with membranes critically requires the presence of the myristoyl moiety. Thus, the differences between the EC50 values for activation of the α4β2 AChR coexpressed with the two VILIP-1 mutants most likely reflected individual differences in their ability to associate with membranes (loss for mVILIP-myr and retention for mVILIP-2,3,4EF). Neuronal AChRs in the central nervous system are the primary mediators of addiction to nicotine. Addiction to nicotine due to repetitive activation of AChRs is thought to change the functional properties of the AChRs themselves and the functional circuitry of the central nervous system by a complex sequence of molecular and cellular processes similar to those activated by other drugs of addiction (36Koob G.F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1992; 13: 177-184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1901) Google Scholar, 37Koob G.F. Neuron. 1996; 16: 893-896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 38Koob G.F. Nestler E.J. J. Neuropsychiatry Clin. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 482-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Because AChRs exhibit significant permeability to calcium, it is reasonable to expect that some of these changes are effected via calcium entry through nicotine-gated AChRs. It was recently demonstrated that chronic low doses of nicotine can also up-regulate recombinant α4β2 AChR function by increasing their agonist sensitivity (39Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, this result was attributed to a possible interaction of α4β2 AChRs with cytosolic proteins in the host cells (39Buisson B. Bertrand D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1819-1829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the endogenous intracellular proteins that can increase the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs. The ability of VILIP-1 to increase the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs could account for the observations of that chronic nicotine alters α4β2 AChR function. The increased agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs may represent one mechanism by which chronic exposure to low doses of nicotine (as occurs in the central nervous system neurons of nicotine addicts) augments synaptic transmission involving α4β2 AChRs where they, in turn, modulate the release of multiple neurotransmitters including dopamine. The illustration in Fig. 8 shows a model that incorporates key features of our findings. In this model, repetitive exposure to nicotine would increase calcium entry into neurons due to activation of nicotine-gated AChRs, which in turn would trigger the calcium-myristoyl switch of VILIP-1 and cause it to translocate to the membrane in the vicinity of activated AChRs. The association of VILIP-1 with the AChRs would have two consequences, 1) to increase AChR levels possibly by decreasing their turnover and 2) to stabilize them in a state with higher agonist sensitivity. It is possible that behaviors that lead to accumulation of AChRs in this state, including smoking tobacco, become reinforced because of subsequent functional adaptations of neural networks to functioning with AChRs that have higher agonist sensitivity. We have previously demonstrated that a chaperone protein identified as 14-3-3 has a dynamic role in regulating the expression levels of α4β2 AChRs through a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with the α4 subunit (15Jeanclos E.M. Lin L. Treuil M.M. Jayaraman A. DeCoster M.A. Anand R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28281-28290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In addition, an endogenous prototoxin identified as lynx1 was shown to decrease the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs and slow their recovery from desensitization (40Ibanez-Tallon I. Miwa J.M. Wang H.L. Adams N.C. Crabtree G.W. Sine S.M. Heintz N. Neuron. 2002; 33: 893-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The ability of VILIP-1 to modulate both the surface expression and the agonist sensitivity of α4β2 AChRs adds it a growing list of accessory proteins that associate with neuronal AChRs and modulate their biogenesis and functions.

https://openalex.org/W2089439333,"Different mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase (mtNOS) isoforms have been described in rat and mouse tissues, such as liver, thymus, skeletal muscle, and more recently, heart and brain. The modulation of these variants by thyroid status, hypoxia, or gene deficiency opens a broad spectrum of mtNOS-dependent tissue-specific functions. In this study, a new NOS variant is described in rat brain with an M r of 144 kDa and mainly localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. During rat brain maturation, the expression and activity of mtNOS were maximal at the late embryonic stages and early postnatal days followed by a decreased expression in the adult stage (100 ± 9versus 19 ± 2 pmol of [3H]citrulline/min/mg of protein, respectively). This temporal pattern was opposite to that of the cytosolic 157-kDa nNOS protein. Mitochondrial redox changes followed the variations in mtNOS activity: mtNOS-dependent production of hydrogen peroxide was maximal in newborns and decreased markedly in the adult stage, thus reflecting the production and utilization of mitochondrial matrix nitric oxide. Moreover, the activity of brain Mn-superoxide dismutase followed a developmental pattern similar to that of mtNOS. Cerebellar granular cells isolated from newborn rats and with high mtNOS activity exhibited maximal proliferation rates, which were decreased by modifying the levels of either hydrogen peroxide or nitric oxide. Altogether, these findings support the notion that a coordinated modulation of mtNOS and Mn-superoxide dismutase contributes to establish the rat brain redox status and participate in the normal physiology of brain development.

Thus, the mtNOS family appears to cover a broad spectrum of structurally and immunologically different proteins that could result from transcriptional or translational modifications that allow them to be targeted to mitochondria. However, differences between mtNOS and the classic NOS isoforms were reported: liver mtNOS exhibits an amino acid sequence similar to iNOS (8Tatoyan A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 9Lopez M.F. Kristal B.S. Chernokalskaya E. Lazarev A. Shestopalov A.I. Bogdanova A. Robinson M.

Rebagliati I. Zaninovich A.A. Poderoso J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2282-H2288PubMed Google Scholar); and a distinct kinetic pattern has been observed for mtNOS (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11044-11048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). mtNOS seems to possess functions adapted to tissue-specific needs. In support of this notion, mtNOS activities in liver and skeletal muscle are modulated by the thyroid status (6Carreras M.C. Peralta J.G. Converso D.P. Finocchietto P.V. Rebagliati I. Zaninovich A.A. Poderoso J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: H2282-H2288PubMed Google Scholar), and those in brain and liver are modulated by hypoxia (5Lacza Z. Puskar M. Figueroa J.P. Zhang J. Rajapakse N. Busija D.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Moreover, the level of mtNOS expression is modified by the activity or deficiency of specific genes, such as dystrophin in the heart (7Kanai A.J. Pearce L.L. Clemens P.R. Birder L.A. Van Bibber M.M. Choi S.Y., De Groat W.C. Peterson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14126-14131Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The regulation of mtNOS provides a new insight into the physiological significance of ⋅NO and mitochondria in cell biology. It is well known that ⋅NO binds to cytochrome oxidase with high affinity, modulates O2 uptake (10Poderoso J.J. Carreras M.C. Lisdero C. Riobó N. Schöpfer F. Boveris A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 11Brown G.C. Copper C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar), and increases the mitochondrial production of superoxide anion (O 2⨪), and depending on mitochondrial matrix Mn-superoxide dismutase levels, of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (10Poderoso J.J.

Accordingly, activation of mtNOS could be followed by an increase in the rate of mitochondrial H2O2 production rate (13Sarkela T.M. Berthiaume J. Elfering S. Gybina A.A. Giulivi C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6945-6949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). H2O2, generated in this manner, is involved in the regulation of different cellular processes: in brain, it could participate in cell signaling networks during early synaptogenesis and plasticity (14Yermolaieva O. Brot N. Weissbach H. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar); furthermore, following mtNOS activation, an exacerbated oxidant production may play a role in apoptotic signaling (15Ghafourifar P. Bringold U. Klein S.D. Richter C. Biol. Signals Recept. 2001; 10: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Characteristically, nNOS and splice variants of thenNOS gene with distinctive subcellular localizations are differentially expressed during the embryonic life (16Eliasson M. Blackshaw S. Schell M.J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3396-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) and are related to the normal development of the brain (17Ogilvie P. Schilling K. Billingsley M. Schmidt H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These studies were aimed at analyzing the occurrence of an NOS activity localized in brain mitochondria, its developmental profile, and its influence on redox metabolism. The physiological significance of these studies was strengthened by an experimental approach aimed at providing a relationship between mitochondrial production of ⋅NO and H2O2 and neuron proliferation. 3-Amino-1,2,4-triazole, aprotinin, l-arginine, bovine serum albumin, calmodulin, catalase, CHAPS, Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase, cytochrome c, dithiothreitol, EDTA, FAD, FMN, glutathione, HEPES, horseradish peroxidase, hydrogen peroxide, KCN, leupeptin, NADPH,N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA), ovomucoid, Percoll, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, p-hydroxy-phenyl acetic acid, poly-d-lysine, sucrose, tetrahydrobiopterin, Tris, trypsin, xanthine, and xanthine oxidase were from Sigma. Mn(III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (Mn(III) TBAP) was from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI), and DNase was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. N-Acetyl cysteine was a gift from Dr. Daniel Colombari (Poen Laboratories, Buenos Aires, Argentina). Monoclonal antibodies anti-neuronal NOS (1095–1289), polyclonal anti-endothelial NOS, and polyclonal anti-macrophage iNOS were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); polyclonal anti-neuronal NOS (1409–1429) and monoclonal anti-neuronal NOS (1–181) were from Sigma. l-[2,3,-3H]Arginine was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acrylamide solutions, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, and Immun-Star® kit were from Bio-Rad. Nitric oxide solutions (1.2–1.8 mm) were obtained by bubbling⋅NO gas to 99.9% purity (AGA Gas Inc., Maumee, OH) in water degassed with helium for 30 min at room temperature and stocked for a week at 4 °C. Adult Wistar rats were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brain or cerebellum was rapidly removed and homogenized in 320 mm sucrose/20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. For developmental experiments, brain or cerebellum dissected from embryos (n = 15–30) or neonate animals of different ages (n = 5–10) was pooled. Mitochondria and synaptosomes were purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation as described (1Giulivi C. Poderoso J.J. Boveris A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11038-11043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) in a buffer consisting of 0.23m mannitol, 0.07 m sucrose, 0.5 mmEGTA, and 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The cytosolic fraction was obtained after 100,000 × g centrifugation of the 8,000 × g supernatant of brain homogenates. Except for experiments in the presence of proteinase K, which required intact mitochondria, and the isolation of submitochondrial particles, all determinations were performed utilizing once frozen/thawed mitochondria. Percoll-purified mitochondria were frozen and thawed three times and then sonicated twice at 40 watts with a Cole-Parmer sonicator (WPI, Sarasota, FL). Subsequently, samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 ×g to precipitate unbroken mitochondria, and the supernatant was then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The supernatant (soluble fraction) was separated from the pellet (membranes), and the latter was suspended in 0.25 msucrose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 20 mm CHAPS and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C under gentle shaking. The preparation was then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant (CHAPS-soluble fraction) and pellet (CHAPS-insoluble fraction) were separated and stored at −70 °C until used. ⋅NO production was assessed by the conversion of [3H]l-arginine to [3H] l-citrulline as described previously (18Knowles R. Salter M. Titheradge M. Nitric Oxide Protocols. Human Press, Totowa, NJ1998: 67-73Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Mitochondrial and cytosolic activities were measured in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, in the presence of either 120 μm (mitochondria) or 20 μm (cytosol) l-arginine, 100 μmNADPH, 0.1 μm calmodulin, 0.3 mmCaCl2, 1 μm FAD, 1 μm FMN, 10 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, and 100 μg of mitochondrial protein. Specific activity was calculated by subtracting the remaining activity in the presence of 10-fold excess concentration of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NMMA. Purified mitochondria were suspended in 4% formaldehyde freshly prepared from paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 2 h at 4 °C and then dehydrated in 70, 96, and 100% ethanol (30 min for each step) and embedded in LR White. Slides were obtained with glass knives and placed on nickel grids over Formvar membranes. Immunocytochemistry was performed using a primary rabbit anti C-terminal nNOS (1409–1429) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS, pH 7.4. After washing with PBS, a goat anti-rabbit serum conjugated with colloidal gold (10-nm diameter particles) was used at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS, pH 7.4. Grids were washed again in PBS and slightly counterstained with 1% uranyl acetate in water for 5 min. Nonspecific background was blocked by incubating the grids with 5% normal goat serum in PBS at the beginning of the procedure. Specimens were observed in a Zeiss EM-109-T transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. H2O2production was continuously monitored in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorometer (Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with excitation and emission wavelengths at 315 and 425 nm, respectively (19White R.J. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5688-5697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The assay medium consisted of 25 mm sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, 20 mm KCl, 10 mmPO4K2, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and it was supplemented with 12.5 units/ml horseradish peroxidase, 50 μm p-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, and 0.1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml with 6 mm succinate as substrate. To explore the effects of ⋅NO and mtNOS activity on mitochondrial H2O2 production rate, the assay was initiated by supplementation with either 0.1 mml-arginine or a pulse of ⋅NO or 2 μmantimycin A. To assess specific mtNOS-dependent H2O2 production rates, 1 mml-NMMA was added to the mitochondrial preparations in the appropriate cases. To restrict oxidative decay of intramitochondrial⋅NO, assays were carried out at about 70 μmO2. All fluorometric variations in the different conditions were attributable to H2O2 as they were completely inhibited by supplementation with 3 μmcatalase. To make the maximal H2O2 production rate uniform, mitochondrial preparations were supplemented with 1 mm of the superoxide dismutase mimetic Mn(III) TBAP. NADH-cytochrome c reductase and succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities (complexes I–III and complexes II and III, respectively) were assayed spectrophotometrically by determining cytochrome c reduction at 550 nm in the presence of 30 μm cytochromec, 1 mm KCN, and either 150 μmNADH or 8 mm succinate as electron donors. Cytochrome oxidase activity (complex IV) was determined by recording the oxidation of 50 μm reduced cytochrome c in a Hitachi 3000 spectrophotometer at 550 nm; ε550 = 21 mm−1 cm−1 (20Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1331) Google Scholar). The rate of the reaction was determined as the pseudo-first order reaction (k′) constant and expressed as min−1 mg of protein−1. Ubiquinone content in isolated mitochondria was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (Waters) with UV detection at 275 nm after extraction with cyclohexane:ethano1 (5:2) (6 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml and 7 ml of cyclohexane:ethanol) (21Lang J.K. Gohil K. Packer L. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 106-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Mn- and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activities were determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the inhibition of cytochromec reduction by the xanthine/xanthine oxidase system, as described previously (22McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the reduction rate of 10 μm cytochrome c by 3.5 microunits/ml xanthine oxidase and 50 μm xanthine was followed in the absence (basal) or presence of 100 μg of cytosolic or mitochondrial proteins. Both cytochrome oxidase and Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase were inhibited by 1 mm KCN. Superoxide dismutase units in each fraction were calculated by extrapolation from a calibration curve with titrated commercial Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase. Aliquots of 100 μg of protein were separated by electrophoresis on reducing 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-buffered saline solution, pH 7.4, and blocked with 4% non-fat milk. Membranes were incubated with the first antibody (1 h, 1:1000 dilution), washed, and subsequently incubated with a secondary goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1 h, 1:3000 dilution). Bands were detected by chemiluminescence using Immun-Star® (Bio-Rad). Quantification of bands was performed by digital image analysis using a Hewlett-Packard scanner and Totallab analyzer software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Biodynamics). Cerebellar granule cell cultures were obtained as described previously (23Borodinsky L.N. Fiszman M.L. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 107: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Five-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were decapitated, and cerebella were dissected in Krebs-Ringer solution supplemented with 6 g/l glucose. Meninges were eliminated, and tissue was cut into 1-mm pieces and incubated in saline containing 0.025% trypsin, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 15 min at 37 °C with continuous agitation. The enzymatic digestion was stopped with ovomucoid (trypsin inhibitor), and the tissue was mechanically dissociated with Pasteur pipettes of two different diameters (25 strokes) in saline-containing ovomucoid and 0.01% DNase. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 150 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in cell culture medium (Neurobasal, Invitrogen). Cells were inoculated onto 96 multiwells (300,000 cells/well) coated with poly-d-lysine (molecular weight 300,000) in serum-free medium supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded on 96 multiwells, and after 2 h, they were incubated with [3H]thymidine (1 mCi/ml) for 22 h. Drug treatments were performed simultaneously with the addition of [3H]thymidine. The cells were osmotically disrupted through a 2-min incubation with bidistilled water and harvested with a Nunc cell harvester coupled to glass fiber filters (Whatman, GF/C) as described previously (23Borodinsky L.N. Fiszman M.L. Dev. Brain Res. 1998; 107: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Filters were washed seven times with bidistilled water and allowed to dry overnight. Radioactivity was counted in a liquid scintillation β-counter. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was expressed as the ratio (experimental − control)/control. Student's t test and linear regression analysis were used as appropriate; statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. NOS activity was assessed in rat brain cytosol, synaptosomes, and purified mitochondria (TableI). In samples obtained from adult rats, the activity present in the mitochondrial fraction represented about 10% of that of cytosolic nNOS. The purification of mitochondria from organelles with similar sedimentation properties was confirmed by measuring the ratio between succinate-cytochrome c reductase (mitochondrial marker) and acidic phosphatase (lysosomal marker) activities. The mitochondrial preparations used throughout this study were enriched about 30-fold in mitochondrial markers. In addition, we confirmed the purity and the integrity of mitochondria by electron microscopy.Table IDistribution of nitric oxide synthase activity in brain tissueFractionSpecific Activitypmol 3H-citrulline/min/mg of proteinSubcellular levelCytosol180 ± 16Synaptosomes54 ± 4Mitochondria17 ± 1Submitochondrial levelSoluble2 ± 0.1Membranes60 ± 4CHAPS-soluble fraction43 ± 4CHAPS-insoluble fraction252 ± 19The different fractions were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are the means of three different experiments (expressed as mean ± S.E.). Open table in a new tab The different fractions were obtained as described under “Materials and Methods.” Data are the means of three different experiments (expressed as mean ± S.E.). NOS activity was not affected by pretreatment of intact mitochondria with proteinase K, suggesting that it was not a product of cytosolic contamination and that the protein was localized inside the organelles. Accordingly, after fractionation of submitochondrial particles, NOS activity was enriched by 18-fold in the membrane fraction, which was mainly composed of inner mitochondrial membrane (CHAPS-insoluble fraction) (Table I). Brain mtNOS activity was dependent on tetrahydrobiopterin, Ca2+/calmodulin, and NADPH, and to a lesser extent, on flavins (Fig. 1), as reported previously for nNOS. The mitochondrial NOS activity that represented theN G-monomethyl-l-arginine-sensitive activity was also inhibited by the NOS inhibitorsNG-nitro-l-arginine, 7-nitroindazol, andN-iminoethyl-l-ornithine and by the flavoprotein inhibitor, diphenylene iodonium. Preliminary kinetics studies yielded a similar apparent K m for mtNOS and nNOS (2–12 μm). Cytosolic nNOS (157 kDa) was not observed in mitochondria; instead, a band ofM r ≈ 144 kDa was detected by two anti-nNOS antibodies directed to the C-terminal domain (anti-nNOS 1409–1429 and anti-nNOS 1095–1289) but not by antibodies directed to theN-terminal segment (anti-nNOS 1–181) (Fig.2 A). In addition, the 144-kDa protein did not cross-react with anti-eNOS or anti-iNOS antibodies (Fig. 2 A). The antibody against the NADPH-binding site of nNOS (anti-nNOS 1095–1289) abolished NOS activity in mitochondria, whereas neither anti-nNOS 1409–1429 nor anti-nNOS 1–181 did, thus confirming the identity of the band (Fig. 2 B). The synaptosomal fraction, nerve end terminals containing synaptic mitochondria, exhibited a double band of nNOS (157 kDa) and mtNOS (144 kDa) proteins (Fig. 2 C). The specific detection of mtNOS by anti-nNOS 1409–1429 was used to assess by means of immuno-electron microscopy the localization of mtNOS at the ultrastructural level. In these conditions, colloidal gold particles were clearly detected in mitochondria (Fig. 3 A). Moreover, the background levels were low, and samples processed with normal rabbit serum as a primary antibody did not show any labeling, thus confirming the specificity of the reaction. A more detailed study of the ultrastructural localization of the enzyme in mitochondria using a higher dilution of the first serum showed that labeling was mainly located in the inner face of the mitochondrial inner membrane, and to a lesser extent, in the mitochondrial matrix. (Fig. 3 B). The up-regulation of a 144-kDa nNOS variant in rat synaptosomes was reported to occur early after birth (17Ogilvie P. Schilling K. Billingsley M. Schmidt H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In this study, the expression (Fig. 4) and activity (Fig. 5) of mtNOS in the brain of embryos and neonate animals in parallel to cytosolic nNOS were addressed as follows. (a) Cytosolic nNOS activity and expression were faintly detectable by embryonic day 15 and 19 and increased after birth to peak around the second and third postnatal weeks (Fig. 4 A) (as reported previously (17Ogilvie P. Schilling K. Billingsley M. Schmidt H. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). (b) mtNOS activity showed a different developmental pattern: its expression and activity were elevated throughout the late embryonic period (Fig. 4 B; E15–E19) up to the first postnatal week (Fig. 4 B; P0–P6) and markedly decreased beyond this age. Thus, at P0, mtNOS protein expression and activity were about 6-fold higher than the corresponding adult values. The modulation of mtNOS activity was attributed to changes in protein expression, as inferred from the respective ratios (Fig. 5). Furthermore, mtNOS followed a similar developmental pattern in cerebellum, although elevated activity persisted until postnatal day 15 (Fig. 5, inset). (c) Studies on the synaptosomal fraction permitted us to observe the co-modulation of both mtNOS and nNOS: in this preparation, mtNOS from synaptic mitochondria was apparently unique during the first 4 days; beyond this time point, both enzymes could be detected (Fig.4 C).Figure 5Nitric-oxide synthase-specific activities during rat brain development.

In barn owls, this process takes place in the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX). However, to date, no trace of visual activity has been observed in this auditory nucleus. Here we show that strong visual responses, which are appropriate to guide auditory plasticity, appear in the ICX when inhibition is blocked in the optic tectum. Thus, visual spatial information is gated into the auditory system by an inhibitory mechanism that operates at a higher level in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1973856002,"Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the pathway responsible for the formation of the majority of bile acids. Transcription of the gene is regulated by the size of the bile acid pool and dietary and hormonal factors. The farnesoid X receptor and the liver X receptor (LXR) are responsible for regulation by bile acids and cholesterol, respectively. To study the effects of dietary cholesterol and fat upon expression of the human CYP7A1 gene, mice were generated by crossing transgenic mice carrying the humanCYP7A1 gene with mice that were homozygous knock-outs (CYP7A1−/−). The mice (mCYP7A1−/−/hCYP7A1) expressed the human gene at much higher levels than did the transgenics bred in the wild-type background. A diet containing 1% cholic acid reduced the expression of the human gene in mCYP7A1−/−/hCYP7A1 mice to undetectable levels. Cholestyramine (5%) increased the level of expression of the human gene and the mouse gene. Thus, farnesoid X receptor-mediated regulation was preserved. A diet containing 2% cholesterol increased expression of the mouse gene in wild-type mice, but it did not affect expression of the human gene in mCYP7A1−/−/hCYP7A1 mice. None of the diets altered the serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels in these mice; 1% cholic acid caused a redistribution of cholesterol from the high density lipoprotein to the low density lipoprotein density in the humanized mice but not in wild-type mice. A diet containing 30% saturated fat and 2% cholesterol caused a decrease in CYP7A1 levels in mCYP7A1−/−/hCYP7A1 mice. The serum cholesterol levels rose in all mice fed this diet. The increase was greater in the mCYP7A1−/−/hCYP7A1 mice. Together, these data suggest that the lack of an LXR element in the region from −56 to −49 of the human CYP7A1 promoter may account for some of the differences in response to diets between humans and rodents."

Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). IRS-1 was the first to be identified as a docking protein for both the insulin and the IGF-I receptors. It transmits a signal from both receptors by interacting with a number of partners, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, SHP2, Grb2, Crk, and others (2Myers Jr., M.G. White M.F. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 616-658Crossref Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 3Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Wang L.M. Sun X.J. Pierce J.H. Blenis J. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28783-28789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors and phosphorylation of IRS-1 are essential steps in signal transduction. Of the downstream signals generated by IRS-1, the best studied is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling pathway, which plays a major role in a number of biological responses to growth factors (1White M.F.

IRS-1 interacts directly with both the insulin and the IGF-I receptors, and the domains required for their interaction have also been identified (5Yenush L. Zanella C. Uchida T. Bernal D. White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6784-6794Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because of its direct interaction with the receptors, its size, and its downstream signaling, it has been generally assumed that IRS-1 is an exclusively cytosolic (or plasma membrane) protein (6Jacobs A.R.

T antigen and nucleolin are predominantly nuclear proteins, although minor fractions of either protein can be found in the cytosol (11Gil D. Gutierrez D. Alarcon B. J. Biol.

It has been therefore tacitly assumed that IRS-1, anchored to the receptor, was interacting with the minor cytosolic fractions of T antigen and nucleolin.

BioEssays. 1998; 20: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) have summarized in a review the evidence that growth factors and their receptors can accumulate in the nuclei of cells. IGF-I, IGF-IR, and IRS-1 are not mentioned in that review, but insulin is (26Soler A.P Thompson K.A. Smith R.M. Jarrett L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6640-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The first observation that IRS-1 can be translocated to the nuclei should be credited to Lassak et al. (27Lassak A. DelValle L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17231-17238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), who used medulloblastoma cells expressing the human JCV virus. The nuclear translocation of IRS-1 in association with T antigen (this time, the SV40 T antigen) was confirmed by Prisco et al. (28Prisco M. Santini F. Baffa R. Liu M. Drakas R., Wu, A. Baserga R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32078-32085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this communication, we have extended the observations of Lassak et al. (27Lassak A. DelValle L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32078-32085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar) to other cell lines and have attempted to obtain information on the biological significance of the nuclear translocation. Our results confirm that IRS-1 is translocated to the nuclei and especially to the nucleoli of cells in culture. Oncogenes like SV40 T antigen and v-src, as well as the activated IGF-IR can induce nuclear/nucleolar translocation of IRS-1. In addition, our data indicate that nuclear IRS-1 (but not cytosolic IRS-1) interacts with the upstream binding factor (UBF), a protein that regulates RNA polymerase I activity and, therefore, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis (29Grummt I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 62: 109-151Google Scholar, 30Kuhn A. Grummt I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7340-7344Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In agreement with this interaction, cells with nuclear/nucleolar IRS-1 have a markedly increased rRNA synthesis at levels superior to those found in cells with cytosolic localization of IRS-1. Our findings, coupled with previous findings that IRS-1 increases cell size (see “Discussion”), suggest that nuclear IRS-1 may be involved in sustained cell growth, especially through the production of rRNA. The cell lines used in these experiments are mostly mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) generated by a 3T3 protocol. The parental cell line was derived from mouse embryos with a targeted disruption of the IGF-IR genes (31Liu J-P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A.

R+ cells were obtained from R− cells by stable transfection with a plasmid expressing the wild-type human IGF-IR. R+ cells express high levels of IGF-I receptors and respond to IGF-I with growth (33Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell.

Viral transduction was performed as previously described (35Romano G. Prisco M. Zanocco-Marani T. Peruzzi F. Valentinis B. Baserga R. J. Cell.

For experiments on rRNA synthesis, 32D IGF-IR, 32D/IRS-1, and 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells were used. These cells are described in detail in Zhou-Li et al. (9Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R.

Cells plated on glass coverslips were washed with PBS and fixed with 3.0% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, followed by permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with PBS, and nonspecific binding of IgG was blocked with 10% normal donkey serum (sc-2044, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then stained with the antibodies described below, as indicated. After incubation with primary antibodies, coverslips were washed with PBS three times. The cells were subsequently stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate- and rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies (sc-2078 and sc-2095, Santa Cruz) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, coverslips were washed with PBS three times and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield mounting medium (H-1000, Vector Laboratories Inc.). Fluorescent images were collected on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 confocal microscope using a Zeiss 40× objective. In one experiment, propidium iodide was used to stain the nuclei. In this case, the cells were digested with RNase A (1 mg/ml) for 30 min before staining with propidium iodide (2.5 μg/ml, Molecular Probes P-3566) for 5 min. 32D and 32D-derived cells were washed three times with Hanks' buffer and seeded at a density of 5 × 104/2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus or minus IGF-I (50 ng/ml). Cells were harvested after 16 h, and cytospins were prepared. After fixing in 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS and permeabilization with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, the immunostaining was carried out using the Histomouse SP kit (Zymed Laboratories Inc. 95–9541) following the manufacturer's protocol. The magnifications for the figures presented are 1000×. For cell fractionation, cell monolayers were trypsinized and collected in serum-containing medium. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and taken up in buffer A (10 mm N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), PH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After swelling on ice for 10 min, plasma membranes were disrupted by adding 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and mixing for 10 s. Cell breakage was examined under the microscope. The nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 45 s at 4 °C, and a cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was recovered. The pellet was then washed in 1 ml of ice-cold sucrose buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 3 mm CaCl2, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl PH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The washing of nuclei was repeated three times. The pellet was subsequently resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES PH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After rocking for 20 min at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to recover a nuclear fraction (supernatant). Aliquots of either cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts (50 μg/sample) were resolved by SDS-4–15% polyacrilamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. They were then probed with the antibodies indicated in the figures and developed with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Equal amounts of cell lysates (500 μg/sample, unless otherwise stated) determined by Bio-Rad protein assay, were immunoprecipitated with an anti-IRS-1 antibody (UBI) and 25 μl of protein A+G beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, precipitates were directly subjected to Western blot analysis. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 antibody (06–248, Upstate Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal anti-nucleolin antibody (MS-3, sc-8031, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), rabbit polyclonal anti-Id1 antibody (C-20, sc-488, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), mouse monoclonal anti-SV40 T antigen antibody (Pab101, sc-147, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody conjugated with FITC (16–177, Upstate Biotechnology), mouse monoclonal antibody conjugated to PCNA (PC10, sc-56, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), and mouse monoclonal anti-Grb2 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). To confirm the specificity of IRS-1 detection in the nuclei, we also used two other antibodies: rabbit polyclonal IgG anti-IRS-1, preCT (06–52b, Upstate Biotechnology), and rabbit polyclonal anti-IRS-1 (C-20, sc-559, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The latter was provided with its blocking peptide (C20p, sc-559P). For UBF, we used a mouse monoclonal UBF antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (sc-13125). 32D IGF-IR, 32D/IRS-1, and 32D IGF-IR/IRS-1 cells (38Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 ng/ml of IGF-I (Life Technologies) for the indicated times. In one experiment, 32D IGF-IR/IRS1 cells were pre-treated with rapamycin (Sigma, 10 ng/ml) for 48 h. The cells were then labeled for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate at a final concentration of 250 μCi/ml (ICN Biochemicals) in phosphate-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies). After labeling, the cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium for 2 h. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy MiniKit (Qiagen) and separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose formaldehyde gels. After drying, the 32P-labeled rRNA was visualized by autoradiography. The bands were also counted in a liquid scintillation counter. In previous papers, we showed that IRS-1 could be co-immunoprecipitated with the SV40 T antigen, either in R− cells (8Zhou-Li F. D'Ambrosio C., Li, S. Surmacz E. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4232-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in 32D cells (9Zhou-Li F., Xu, S.-Q. Dews M. Baserga R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 961-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We have investigated the localization of IRS-1 by confocal microscopy, using the appropriate antibodies described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig.1 A shows a confocal microscopy picture of R−/T cells, growing in fetal bovine serum. The cells were stained for IRS-1 (rhodamine, left) or SV40 T antigen (FITC, center), and the right panel gives the merged picture. T antigen is, as expected, almost exclusively localized in the nucleus, but so is IRS-1. The merged picture gives a clear co-localization (there are tiny specks of both proteins in the surrounding cytoplasm, but both T antigen and IRS-1 are mostly nuclear). The specificity of the immunohistochemistry for IRS-1 was monitored in several ways (see also below in the section on R+ cells). First, we determined the localization of IRS-1 in the parental R− cells by confocal microscopy. R− cells have no IGF-I receptors, but high levels of IRS-1, at least in comparison to other 3T3 cells. Fig.1 B shows R− cells stained with rhodamine for IRS-1 and with FITC for nucleolin. R− cells had been stimulated with IGF-I for 8 h, but the same results were obtained with R− in SFM or stimulated with serum (data not shown). In R− cells, IRS-1 (as detected by this antibody) is essentially limited to the cytoplasm. The nuclei appear asdark centers, dotted by the nucleoli stained with the anti-nucleolin antibody. The same antibody was completely negative when used on two cell lines that do not express IRS-1, prostatic human cancer cells LNCaP, and murine hemopoietic 32D cells (data not shown). To further confirm the results obtained by confocal microscopy, we carried out a subcellular fractionation of R− and R−/T cells (Fig.2). After subcellular fractionation (see “Experimental Procedures”), IRS-1 can be detected in the nuclear fraction of R−/T but not of R− cells (lanes 3 and4). In both cell lines, there is still IRS-1 in the cytosol. The fractions are reasonably pure, as Grb2 is detectable in the cytosol but not in the nuclear fraction of both cell lines. On the contrary, the T antigen can only be detected in the nuclear fraction of R−/T cells (Fig. 2 C). In Fig. 2 D, we have taken the cytosolic and nuclear fractions of both cell lines and immunoprecipitated them with an antibody to IRS-1. T antigen was detected only in the nuclear fraction of R−/T cells. By confocal microscopy, it would seem that IRS-1 is, if not exclusively, largely localized to the nucleus of R−/T cells, while, in Western blots, the majority of IRS-1 is cytosolic, even in R−/T cells. We will discuss this discrepancy in a later section. Either by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1) or by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 2), IRS-1 is detectable in R− cells only in the cytosol. This is true regardless of the growth conditions (SFM, IGF-I, or fetal bovine serum). We then asked whether IRS-1 would be detectable in the nuclei of R+ cells (33Sell C. Dumenil G. Deveaud C. Miura M. Coppola D. DeAngelis T. Rubin R. Efstratiadis A. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), which are R− cells expressing a wild-type human IGF-IR. R+ cells were stained with antibodies to IRS-1 (rhodamine) or nucleolin (FITC). Fig. 1 Cis a confocal microscope image of R+ cells kept in SFM for 48 h (quiescent cells). Fig. 1 D, shows the same cells 8 h after stimulation with IGF-I (50 ng/ml). In quiescent cells, IRS-1 is mostly, but not exclusively, localized in the cytoplasm. By comparing Fig. 1, C and D, three things are noticeable. In stimulated cells, there is a marked increase in the amount of IRS-1 translocated to the nucleus, the nucleoli are larger, and some of the IRS-1 co-localizes with nucleolin in the nucleoli. These observations were highly reproducible. We followed the same methodology used for R− and R−/T cells. Fig. 3 shows that a substantial fraction of IRS-1 is found in the nuclei of R+ cells stimulated with IGF-I. The nuclear fraction is apparently pure, because Grb2 is not detectable. There is much PCNA in the cytosol fraction, which can only be due to leakage. The presence of PCNA in the cytosol does not invalidate the conclusion that IRS-1 is present in the nucleus. On the contrary, it suggests that its nuclear localization may be underestimated by subcellular fractionation. There is a small amount of IRS-1 in the nuclei of quiescent R+ cells in SFM (the original shows a detectable albeit very weak band), which is in agreement with the findings obtained by confocal microscopy. The nuclear presence of minute amounts of IRS-1 in the nuclei of quiescent R+ cells is explained in the “Discussion.” Also in the “Discussion” will be given the other controls used to validate the specificity of the antibodies used to detect IRS-1. IRS-1 has also been shown to interact with v-src (34Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 39Peterson J.E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31562-31571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and we predicted that IRS-1 would also be translocated to the nuclei in R−v-src cells. R− v-src cells were originally described by Valentinis et al. (34Valentinis B. Morrione A. Taylor S.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3744-3754Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In monolayer cultures, they grow in serum-free medium and form foci in 10% serum. They also form colonies in soft agar, v-src being one of two among several oncogenes tested that can transform R− cells (reviewed in Ref. 40Baserga R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5574-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows a confocal microscopy picture of R− v-src cells in SFM for 48 h. There is staining for IRS-1 in the nuclei of these cells, although the cytoplasm also stains (rhodamine). In these cells, nucleolin stains the nucleoli, but also gives a diffuse staining of the nucleoplasm (FITC). The merged picture confirms the localization of IRS-1 in the nuclei, and the nucleoli, of R− v-src cells. The nuclear translocation of IRS-1 has been confirmed by using a FLAG antibody to detect an IRS-1 expressing a FLAG epitope. For this purpose, we generated cell lines from both R− and R+ cells transfected with a plasmid in which the mouse IRS-1 (41Keller S.R. Aebersold R. Garner C.W. Lienhard G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1172: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) had been tagged with a FLAG epitope (28Prisco M. Santini F. Baffa R. Liu M. Drakas R., Wu, A. Baserga R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32078-32085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In R+ IRS-1/FLAG cells stimulated with IGF-I, the FLAG antibody gave FLAG-positive nuclei. R− cells were also transfected with the IRS-1/FLAG plasmid. In these cells in SFM, the FLAG-stainable material was in the cytoplasm and IGF-I did not cause nuclear translocation (data not shown). The results were the same as in 32D cells transfected with this construct (28Prisco M. Santini F. Baffa R. Liu M. Drakas R., Wu, A. Baserga R. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32078-32085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Other controls include the following. 1) We used three different commercially available antibodies to IRS-1. All of them gave the same results. 2) One of these antibodies came with the peptide used for immunization. Competition with this peptide completely abrogated the staining for IRS-1, both in immunohistochemistry and in confocal mucroscopy. 3) None of the antibodies used gave a reaction with cells not expressing IRS-1, such as LNCaP cells (37Reiss K. Wang J.Y. Romano G., Tu, X. Peruzzi F. Baserga R. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 490-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and parental 32D cells (36Wang L.M. Myers Jr., M.G. Sun X.J. Aaronson S.A. White M. Pierce J.H. Science. 1993; 261: 1591-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 38Valentinis B. Romano G. Peruzzi F. Morrione A. Prisco M. Soddu S. Cristofanelli B. Sacchi A. Baserga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12423-12430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This was true by confocal microscopy and by Western blots. The experimental data are not shown, but are available on request. We have looked at IRS-1 nuclear translocation in R+ cells at various times after stimulation with IGF-I (50 ng/ml). The results are shown in Fig.5 A, where, for convenience, only the merged pictures are given. In all instances, IRS-1 is predominantly nuclear and especially nucleolar. The nucleoli become more prominent after IGF-I stimulation, and the increase in nucleolar size is accompanied by a co-localization of nucleolin and IRS-1 (yellow staining of nucleoli). The increase in nucleolar size as visualized by the anti-nucleolin antibody is dramatic, as confirmed in Fig.5 B. Compare for instance the size of the nucleoli in IGF-I stimulated R+ cells versus the same cells in serum free medium, or the R− cells stimulated with IGF-I. A legitimate question at this point is whether nuclear IRS-1 shows different biological effects than cytosolic IRS-1. The confocal microscopy pictures show strong evidence that IRS-1 localizes not just to the nuclei, but also to the nucleoli. We have also mentioned above that the nucleoli markedly increase in size in R+ cells stimulated with IGF-I, and that IRS-1 often co-localizes with nucleolin in the nucleoli. The interaction of IRS-1 with the nucleoli prompted us to ask whether nuclear/nucleolar IRS-1 plays a role in rRNA synthesis and/or processing. We addressed this question by two different approaches: 1) interaction (by immuno-coprecipitation) of IRS-1 with nucleolar proteins and 2) effect of subcellular local"

Such sensitization to death receptors by oncogenes may well be the mechanism underlying tumor cell sensitivity to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). The mechanism by which this c-Myc-induced sensitization occurs is unclear but could involve modulation of expression of death receptors or their ligands or potentiation of the sensitivity of mitochondria to release pro-apoptotic effectors such as holocytochrome c. Here, we show that ectopic expression of the death receptor signaling protein RIP (receptor-interactive protein) triggers apoptosis via a FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) and caspase 8-dependent pathway. Induction of apoptosis by this intracellular activation of the death receptor signaling pathway is significantly augmented by c-Myc expression. Moreover, c-Myc expression strongly promotes the potential of RIP to induce cytochromec release from mitochondria. This implicates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in this synergy, a notion confirmed by the inability of c-Myc to sensitize to RIP killing in cells lacking the obligate mitochondrial apoptotic effectors Bax and Bak. We conclude that the lethality of the RIP-activated cytosolic caspase 8 pathway is augmented by c-Myc priming mitochondria to release cytochromec. This places the intersection of apoptotic synergy between c-Myc and death receptor signaling downstream of the death receptors.

The immediate consequence of such proliferative deregulation, which characterizes most, if not all, human cancer cells (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22068) Google Scholar) can be either cell expansion or, paradoxically, the destruction of affected cells through apoptosis. Both cell culture and animal models have shown that the ultimate fate of a cell population expressing activated c-Myc depends on cell type and the availability of survival factors as well as on the presence of any anti-apoptotic lesions (for review, see Ref. 2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar). Understanding how to favor the apoptotic aspect of c-Myc over its proliferative functions offers the potential for selective ablation of tumor cells. In cultured cells, the presence of survival factors such as is insulin-like growth factor-1 or serum counteracts the apoptotic action of c-Myc (3Harrington E.A. Bennett M.R. Fanidi A. Evan G.I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). However, even in the presence of such survival factors, cells with deregulated c-Myc remain hypersensitive to multiple apoptotic insults including genotoxic damage, hypoxia, interferon-γ, irradiation, and NK cells (Ref. 2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2666) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, both c-Myc and the Rb pathway effector E2F-1 can induce sensitivity to ligand-induced activation of the cell surface death receptors p55 TNFR,1 TRAIL receptors, and CD95 (4Hueber A.O. Zornig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 5Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H.

In the specific instance of TNFR, part of the increased TNF sensitivity is attributable to a c-Myc- or E2F-1-induced failure of TNFR to activate NF-κB-dependent survival pathways (5Phillips A.C. Ernst M.K. Bates S. Rice N.R. Vousden K.H. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 771-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar,8Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), rendering the cells more vulnerable to the apoptotic signal initiated by ligand-bound TNFR. This death signal is mediated by FADD and caspase 8, whose pro-forms are recruited to the cytosolic tail of death receptors in a death receptor-induced signaling complex (DISC) (9Krammer P.H. Nature. 2000; 407: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar, 10Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar). It is thought that in the death receptor-induced signaling complex, the close proximity of zymogenic pro-caspases 8 triggers auto-proteolytic activation of the pro-forms and consequent formation of active caspases 8. An active caspase 8 can further activate downstream effector caspases such as caspase 3. The ability of c-Myc to promote TNFR-initiated apoptosis as well as to induce apoptosis upon survival factor deprivation is strongly suppressed in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (6Klefstrom J. Vastrik I. Saksela E. Valle J. Eilers M. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5442-5450Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11Fanidi A. Harrington E.A. Evan G.I. Nature. 1992; 359: 554-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 proteins counteract apoptotic sensitization by c-Myc in multiple tissues, and this is thought to be the mechanism underlying oncogenic synergy between c-Myc and Bcl-2 (12Pelengaris S. Khan M. Evan G.I. Cell. 2002; 109: 321-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 13Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2716) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 belongs to the BH3 domain carrying mitochondrial Bcl-2 family proteins comprising anti- (e.g. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) and pro-apoptotic (e.g. Bax and Bak) members. These proteins modulate each others' activities by forming heterodimers that regulate the release of cytochrome c (cyt c) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol. When the anti-apoptotic BH3 proteins dominate, cyt c release is inhibited, whereas the pro-apoptotic BH3 proteins promote cyt c release (14Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, cyt c activates apoptosis by binding and activating the Apaf-1-caspase 9 complex. This “apoptosome” acts as a processing/activation center for the downstream caspase 3 (15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Analogous to the overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, lack of pro-apoptotic Bax also renders cells refractory to the apoptotic activity of c-Myc (16Mitchell K.O. Ricci M.S. Miyashita T. Dicker D.T. Jin Z. Reed J.C. El-Deiry W.S. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6318-6325PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a cell population deprived of survival factors, c-Myc induces a rapid cyt c release that precedes any other detectable apoptotic changes (17Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the c-Myc-dependent activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway plays a key role in the apoptotic sensitization. In the specific instance of TNFR, sensitization by c-Myc in part involves inhibition of the NF-κB survival pathway. However, neither CD95 nor TRAIL death receptors consistently activate NF-κB (10Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar, 18Tran S.E. Holmstrom T.H. Ahonen M. Kahari V.M. Eriksson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16484-16490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), so c-Myc-induced sensitization to these death receptors must presumably involve other mechanisms. In T cells, there is evidence that c-Myc may directly up-regulate expression of the CD95 ligand (19Brunner T. Kasibhatla S. Pinkoski M.J. Frutschi C. Yoo N.J. Echeverri F. Mahboubi A. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9767-9772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, this mechanism does not explain how c-Myc induces global sensitivity to three different death receptors. In fibroblasts, where there is an apparent dependence of c-Myc-induced apoptosis on CD95, we have proposed that c-Myc sensitizes cells to constitutive low level CD95 signaling, thereby amplifying a weak, sub-lethal death receptor signal into one capable of inducing apoptosis (20Hueber A.O. Evan G.I. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). According to the model, the c-Myc and death receptor pathways synergistically intersect downstream of the activated death receptor. If so, this implies that c-Myc should also induce cellular sensitization when the death receptor signaling pathways are activated intracellularly, downstream of the death receptor. We show here that c-Myc activation significantly augments the apoptotic activity of cytosolic death receptor adaptor proteins RIP and FADD as well as the death receptor effector pro-caspase 8. We also show that the apoptotic activity of RIP, which is strictly dependent on FADD and caspase 8, is contingent on c-Myc priming of mitochondrial BH3 proteins to release cyt c. Our results demonstrate that the mitochondrial effects of c-Myc, which promote cyt c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, amplify the apoptotic activity of a FADD and caspase 8-dependent death receptor signaling pathway. Our model proposes a general mechanism whereby c-Myc induces hypersensitivity to apoptosis by different death receptors. Rat-1-MycERTAM and Rat-1-MycΔERTAM cells have been previously published (21Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). To create Rat-1-ERTAME2F-1, Rat-1-p65, and Rat-1-SRIκBα cells, Rat-1 cells were retrovirally transduced with a pBabe-puro construct encoding the N-terminal ERTAM-E2F-1 fusion protein, the p65 sub-unit of NF-κB, and SRIκBα. The retrovirus-infected cells were selected in 2.5 μg/ml puromycin, and individual drug-resistant clones were expanded and collected. The expression of transduced constructs was verified by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies. MEF-MycERTAM cells were created as previously described (8Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. The established cell lines containing expression constructs were periodically grown in selection medium. The MycERTAM and ERTAME2F-1 constructs were activated by the addition of 100 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT; Sigma) to the cell culture medium if not otherwise stated in the text. Caspases were inhibited with 50 μm final concentration of zVAD-fmk (Enzyme Systems Products). The RIP deletion mutants were created by PCR using murine RIP cDNA as a template. Amino acid point mutation K45R that specifically eliminates the kinase activity or RIP (22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar) was introduced into kinase-dead RIP (RIPKin) by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild type RIP and RIP mutants were subsequently cloned into pcDNA 3.1+ (Invitrogen) and retroviral pBMN-ires-GFP expression vectors. Protein expression from these constructs was verified from total lysates of transfected or transduced cells by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. The cDNAs of CrmA, p35, FADD, dominant-negative-FADD, caspase 8, and Bcl-xL were all in CMV promoter-driven expression vectors. For transfection, cells were seeded at a density of 150,000 cells/well into 6-well plates. The next day, cells were transfected with mixtures of expression plasmid DNAs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) reagent. Each transfection mixture contained a total amount of 1.2 μg of plasmid DNA made up from a combination of 1 μg of effector plasmid (adjusted with empty plasmid DNA as needed) and 0.2 μg of CMV-β-galactosidase. CMV-β-galactosidase was included in the mix to mark the transfected cells by β-galactosidase-specific staining. Cells were transfected for 3 h after which the lipid-DNA complexes were washed off from the cells. In experiments with Rat-1 cells carrying MycERTAM or ERTAME2F-1 construct, either OHT (c-Myc/E2F-1 ON) or ethanol carrier (c-Myc/E2F-1 OFF) was added to the cells at 6 h post-transfection. 24 h after transfection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde, washed again, and stained with β-galactosidase-specific staining solution (8Klefstrom J. Arighi E. Littlewood T. Jaattela M. Saksela E. Evan G.I. Alitalo K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7382-7392Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation at 37 °C, 300–1000 transfected blue cells per well were examined for apoptosis by microscopic analysis. Apoptotic cells exhibited characteristic round or irregular morphology, which was easily distinguishable from the morphology of non-apoptotic fibroblasts. Transfection experiments employing a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-encoding vector pBMN-ires-GFP showed a correlation between the intensity of fluorescence in transfected cells and the amount of expression vector that was included in the transfection mixture. In flow cytometric analysis, the mean green fluorescence values (arbitrary units) obtained for pBMN-ires-GFP-transfected cells were 41, 59, 73, 85, 96, and 142 when 0.0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 μg, respectively, of pBMN-ires-GFP was included in the transfection mixture (in each case the total plasmid concentration was balanced to 1 μg with pcDNA3.1+ DNA). This established a correlation between the protein expression level in the individual transfected cells and the concentration of corresponding expression vector in the transfection mixture. High titer retroviral stocks were isolated from transiently transfected Phoenix-E packaging cells following the inventor's protocol with minor changes (www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_free.html). Briefly, Phoenix-E cells (6 × 106) were plated in 10-cm dishes instead of 6-cm dishes before the transfection. Chloroquine was omitted, and the cells were transfected using a liposome-mediated transfection kit (LipofectAMINE Plus, Invitrogen) rather than calcium chloride. Retroviral supernatants were collected, separated into aliquots, and stored frozen at −70 °C unless otherwise stated in the text. At the time of infection, retrovirus stocks were applied at a 1:3 dilution to the target cells plated in 6-well dishes. The target cells were then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with retrovirus-containing supernatants and 8 μg/ml Polybrene, after which the dishes were centrifuged at low speed (2500 rpm, 30 min) in a bench-top centrifuge at room temperature. The infected cells were then allowed to recover for 10 min in the cell incubator followed by replacement of the retrovirus supernatants with standard growth medium. The infection efficiency obtained with a single round of infection with pBMN-ires-GFP-based retroviruses was generally 60–70% (GFP+ cells). For flow cytometric analysis, trypsin-detached cells were transferred to 5-ml round-bottom tubes (Falcon). Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, and then suspended in a low volume of calcium/Hepes buffer (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Subsequently, 5 μl of Annexin V-PE (Pharmingen) was added to each tube followed by incubation of the tubes for 15 min in the dark. Before flow cytometric analysis (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences), cells infected with the pBMN-ires-GFP-based retroviruses (GFP+) and the non-infected cells (GFP−) were gated separately, and the percentage of Annexin V+ cells in the infected GFP+ population was determined. FACS sorting (FACSVantage, BD Biosciences) was used to physically separate the infected GFP+ cells from the non-infected ones. Cells were transduced with pBMN-based retroviruses in 6-well plates, and for each individual experiment, cells were collected from two identically treated wells. The yield from the sorting was about 200.000 GFP+ cells/2 wells. For immunocytochemical detection of cyt c release, cells in 6-well plates were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in the wells for 15 min using 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were extensively washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% saponin (Sigma). Anti-cytochrome c antibody (Pharmingen) diluted 1:200 in the 3% bovine serum albumin-saponin buffer was then added to the cells followed by 2 h of incubation. Cells were washed with the buffer and subsequently incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor568 (Molecular Probes) for 2 h at 37 °C. Before immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were washed with buffer containing Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) to stain the cell nuclei. The samples were examined with an inverted fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 5100 TV) equipped with appropriate filters for Alexa Fluor568, Hoechst 33342, and GFP. Images were collected with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu Orca) and processed with OpenLab software (Improvision). Merged images were obtained with the same software. To analyze the amount of cyt c in mitochondria-containing cell fractions, the mitochondria-containing heavy membrane fractions were essentially isolated as described in Juin et al. (17Juin P. Hueber A.O. Littlewood T. Evan G. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1367-1381Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The heavy membrane fractions, solubilized in radioimmune precipitation assay (RIPA) buffer, were examined for cyt c by Western blot analysis using a cyt c-specific antibody (Pharmingen). To measure NF-κB activity, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and transfected as described above with plasmid mixtures, each containing a total of 1.15 μg of plasmid including 0.1 μg of NF-κB-driven plasmid pBIIX-Luc and 0.05 μg of pRL-TK. pRL-TK directs expression of Renilla luciferase under a constitutive promoter and was used as an internal control to normalize the obtained NF-κB values. Transfected cells were lysed at 24 h post-transfection, and both the firefly andRenilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega) and automated microplate luminometer (LB96V, EG&G Berthold). Cells were grown in 6-well plates and at defined time points lysed by the addition of 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaPi, 10 mmNaPPi) per well. Lysates were immediately chilled on ice, clarified by centrifugation, and assayed for total protein concentration. To measure caspase activities, 60–80-μg aliquots of each lysate was incubated in a 100-μl total volume of 1× Salvesen optimal reaction buffer (23Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) made from 5× stock and supplemented with 200 μm colorimetric peptide substrate from Calbiochem, except for Ac-VDVAD-pNA, which was from Alexis. Samples were incubated at 37 °C and read at 405 nm with an automated plate-reading spectrophotometer (Wallac) in 1-h intervals. To define whether death receptor signaling proteins co-operate with c-Myc in the induction of cell death, expression vectors encoding individual signaling proteins were introduced by transfection into Rat-1 fibroblasts containing a conditionally active, OHT-inducible form of c-Myc (MycERTAM). All studies were conducted on Rat-1 cells growing in high serum, under which conditions c-Myc deregulation alone does not induce appreciable apoptosis. The extent of death induced by pro-apoptotic proteins correlated well with the dose of plasmid offered to the cells (see white bars in Fig. 1 B), suggesting that different concentrations of expression plasmid induce different levels of protein expression in individual cells. Studies using a fluorescent marker protein confirmed this by showing a correlation between the marker plasmid concentration used for transient transfection of cell pools and the average expression level of marker protein present in each transfected cell (see “Experimental Procedures”). We observed a significant c-Myc-dependent augmentation of the death-inducing activity of FADD, pro-caspase 8 (Fig. 1 A) and RIP (Fig. 1 B). FADD was extremely lethal to cells but, when expressed at very low levels (10 ng of plasmid in the transfection mix), it induced only modest cell death that was significantly enhanced upon activation of c-Myc (Fig. 1 A). Likewise, c-Myc also enhanced the lethality of pro-caspase 8 although less markedly than for FADD. As with FADD and pro-caspase 8, when RIP was expressed at low levels, at which it was by itself only weakly lethal, activation of c-Myc induced a significant increase in cell death (Fig.1 B). When expressed at high levels, RIP (cells transfected with >1.0 μg of expression plasmid), FADD (>0.05 μg), and pro-caspase 8 (>0.5 μg) all potently induced cell death, and this was only modestly or not at all exacerbated by c-Myc activation (data not shown). Because of the extreme lethality of FADD, we used RIP as an intracellular trigger of cell death in the following studies. RIP is a death receptor adaptor protein with an N-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain and a C-terminal death domain (22Hsu H. Huang J. Shu H.B. Baichwal V. Goeddel D.V. Immunity. 1996; 4: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 24Stanger B.Z. Leder P. Lee T.H. Kim E. Seed B. Cell. 1995; 81: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar). To determine which regions of RIP trigger the death signaling pathway that is augmented by c-Myc, constructs encoding the death domain-deficient form of RIP (RIPΔDD), death domain of RIP alone (RIPDD), and a kinase-dead RIP (RIPKin) were each transiently transfected into MycERTAM cells, and the ensuing cell death was analyzed as above. We found that RIP requires its death domain to kill and to co-operate with c-Myc in death induction (Fig.1 C). However, the death domain on its own, although capable of inducing cell death, did not co-operate with c-Myc. The kinase activity of RIP is required for optimal death induction (Fig.1 C and Holler et al. (25Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar)). However, the lack of kinase activity did not abolish the lethal co-operation of RIP with c-Myc. As a control for c-Myc function, we used a MycERTAMmutant MycΔ106–143ERTAM that lacks a transcription activation domain. This failed to enhance RIP killing, suggesting that the competence of c-Myc for transcriptional regulation is required for the apoptotic sensitization (Fig. 1 D). In summary, c-Myc augments the apoptotic activity of death receptor-signaling proteins FADD, caspase 8, and RIP but only if they are expressed at a level that is only weakly apoptotic. Furthermore, in the case of RIP, the C-terminal death domain is essential, although not sufficient, to activate an apoptotic pathway that synergizes with c-Myc. Biochemical and genetic evidence both place FADD and caspase 8 in the same death receptor pathway (10Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar). However, much less is known of the pathways that mediate the apoptotic action of RIP. Because c-Myc sensitizes to FADD, pro-caspase 8, and RIP, one possibility is that all three lie on the same signaling pathway. To explore this possibility, we examined the dependence of RIP-induced cell death on FADD and caspase 8. First, we confirmed that RIP-induced cell death has the hallmarks of classical apoptosis and is mediated by caspases. Rat-1 cells were infected with pBMN-RIP retroviruses that dictate the bicistronic expression of both RIP and GFP. To characterize the ensuing cell death, infected cells were stained with Annexin V, which binds to externalized phosphatidylserine on the surface of apoptotic cells, and Annexin V binding was quantitated by flow cytometry in GFP-positive cells. We found that RIP potently triggers expression of external phosphatidylserine and that this was blocked by the presence of cell-permeable pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Fig.2 A, left panel). Analysis of caspase activity showed that RIP potently activates DEVD-specific caspases and that zVAD-fmk completely blocks this caspase activation (Fig. 2 A, right panel). Thus, RIP induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in Rat-1 cells. We next asked if RIP-induced apoptosis and activation of DEVD-specific caspases (caspases 3 and 7) is dependent on caspase 8 using MEFs derived from caspase 8 knockout mice. We saw no induction of apoptosis by RIP in caspase 8-deficient MEFs (Fig. 2 B). We then examined whether RIP induces caspase activity in caspase 8-deficient MEFs by incubating cell lysates with various colorimetric caspase substrate peptides. IETD peptide was used as a preferred substrate for caspase 8, and DEVD peptide was used as a substrate for caspase 3/7 activity (26Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1842) Google Scholar). Compared with wild type MEFs, we saw only negligible activities against either peptide in caspase 8-deficient cells (see Fig. 2 C for DEVD, data not shown for IETD). Thus, RIP requires caspase 8 to trigger apoptosis and downstream caspases. RAIDD is an adaptor molecule with the potential to bind both RIP and caspase 2 (27Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that RIP might activate caspase 2 independently of caspase 8. To test for RIP activation of caspase 2 we used the caspase 2-specific colorimetric substrate penta-peptide VDVAD (28Talanian R.V. Quinlan C. Trautz S. Hackett M.C. Mankovich J.A. Banach D. Ghayur T. Brady K.D. Wong W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9677-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar). However, we saw significant cleavage of VDVAD only in caspase 8-expressing cells (Fig. 2 D). This indicates that caspase 8 is also required for the RIP activation of caspase 2-type activity. Last, we determined the role of caspase 8 in the synergistic apoptosis induction by RIP and c-Myc. We retrovirally introduced MycERTAM into caspase 8-deficient MEFs and control cells. We found that RIP completely failed to kill cells lacking caspase 8 even if c-Myc was active (Fig. 3 A). Thus, caspase 8 is essential for the lethal cooperation of RIP and c-Myc. To explore whether RIP employs FADD-dependent or -independent mechanisms to induce caspase 8-mediated apoptosis, we functionally inhibited FADD with a dominant-negative form of FADD (10Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5126) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, expression of dominant-negative FADD (DNFADD) profoundly inhibits RIP-induced cell death and the synergistic death induction by RIP and c-Myc (Fig. 3 B). CrmA, which is the viral caspase 8 inhibitor, similarly inhibited RIP killing and the lethal synergy with c-Myc. Taken together, our data show that FADD and caspase 8 are both required for RIP-induced activation of downstream caspases and"

Here we describe natural product terpenoids found in two fossil conifers, Taxodium balticum (Eocene) and Glyptostrobus oregonensis (Miocene). A similar terpenoid pattern is also observed in extant Taxodium distichum. The preservation of characteristic terpenoids (unaltered natural products) in the fossil conifers supports their systematic assignment to the Cypress family (Cupressaceae sensu lato).

https://openalex.org/W2317356240,"The PTCH1 gene is a human tumour suppressor gene frequently mutated in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and several other tumour types. It encodes a receptor for soluble factors of the hedgehog family. Binding of hedgehog to the receptor relieves its inhibitory action on the transmembrane co-receptor Smoh. In this study we describe alternative first exons of the PTCH1 tumour suppressor gene and show that they are differentially regulated in normal tissues, exon 1B being expressed at very low levels and the major mRNA species containing exon 1 or 1A. Exon 1B transcripts were found to be specifically upregulated in nodular BCCs. The different PTCH1 transcripts all encode proteins that interact with Smoh in doubly transfected cells. Furthermore, functional assays demonstrated that whereas all PTCH1 isoforms can inhibit the activity of SHH, only the PTCH1B isoform is capable of fully inhibiting Smoh activity. The results indicate that in tumour cells the PTCH1B promoter is specifically activated and importantly, that the N-terminal part of PTCH1 including exon 1B is required for full inhibition of Smoh signaling but not for physical interaction with Smoh."

Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) is a classical example of a signal transduction pathway whereby the transfer of a phosphoryl group through a series of bimolecular protein-protein complexes is coupled with the transport of sugars across the membrane (2Herzberg O. Klevit R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C.

Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 329-346PubMed Google Scholar). The initial events of the cascade involve a common pathway: enzyme I, which is autophosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate at His-189 (in Escherichia coli), transfers the phosphoryl group to His-15 (in E. coli) of the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (HPr).1 Subsequently, the phosphoryl group on HPr is transferred to a variety of sugar-specific carbohydrate transporters, known as enzymes II (5Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The enzymes II are organized into several domains, some of which are covalently linked (5Robillard G.T. Broos J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). There are two cytoplasmic domains, IIA and IIB; IIA accepts the phosphoryl group from HPr and then transfers it to IIB. The transmembrane domain IIC (and in some cases IID as well) catalyzes the translocation and phosphoryl transfer from IIB to the incoming sugar. There are five classes of enzymes II as follows: glucose-sucrose, mannitol-fructose, mannose-sorbose, lactose-cellobiose, and glucitol (3Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C.

Four-liter cultures were grown in minimal labeling medium (MLM) (22LaVallie E.R. DiBlasio E.A. Kovacic S. Grant K.L. Schendel P.F. McCoy J.M. Bio/Technology. 1993; 11: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). For labeling with [13C6]glucose and/or15NH4Cl, the media contained 2.5 gm of [13C6]glucose/liter and/or 1 g of15NH4Cl/liter, respectively. Induction was continued overnight. E. coli HPr, unlabeled and/or isotopically labeled with 15N (>95%) and13C (>95%), was purified as described elsewhere (17Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,23Reddy P. Fredd-Kuldell N. Liberman E. Peterkofsky A. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 148 residue IIAMtl domain, containing a methionine residue in front of alanine 491, was purified as follows. Washed cells from a 4-liter culture were suspended in 40 ml of 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The cell suspension was passed twice through a French press at 10,000 pounds/square inch. The ruptured cells were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant fraction was applied to a DE52 anion-exchange column (1.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer E). The column was washed with 100 ml of Buffer E supplemented with 100 mm NaCl (Buffer EE). Then a linear gradient (from 500 ml of Buffer EE to 500 ml of Buffer E + 400 mm NaCl (Buffer F)) was run. Column fractions were screened by SDS-PAGE. Fractions enriched in IIAMtl were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through Filtron 3K membranes. Further purification was achieved by gel filtration chromatography on an AcA-44 Ultrogel column (2.6 × 100 cm) run with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) + 100 mm NaCl. Fractions enriched in IIAMtl were pooled and concentrated as before. All protein samples used for the NMR studies were greater than 95% pure, as judged by both SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional 1H-15N correlation spectra. The majority of NMR samples contained 1–2 mm 1:1 IIAMtl-HPr complex in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The following samples were employed (only the presence of15N and 13C isotopes are indicated; if no C or N isotope is mentioned, then the sample contained 12C or14N at natural isotopic abundance): IIAMtl-HPr(15N), IIAMtl(15N)-HPr, IIAMtl-HPr(15N/13C), IIAMtl(15N/13C)-HPr, IIAMtl(13C)-HPr(15N), and IIAMtl(15N)-HPr(13C). All spectra were recorded at 35 °C on Bruker DMX500, DMX600, DMX750, and DRX800 spectrometers equipped with x,y,z-shielded gradient triple resonance probes. Spectra were processed with the NMRPipe package (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar) and analyzed using the programs NMRDraw and NMRWish (24Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Reson. 1991; 95: 214-220Crossref Scopus (802) Google Scholar). 1H,15N, and 13C sequential assignments were obtained using three-dimensional double and triple resonance through bond correlation experiments (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M.

Three-dimensional experiments employed for sequential assignments included HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, HBHA(CBCACO)NH, H(CCO)NH, C(CCO)NH, and HCCH-TOCSY experiments.3 J N-Cγ,3 J C′-Cγ, and3 J Cα-Cδ couplings were measured using quantitative J correlation spectroscopy (29Bax A.

Interproton distance restraints were derived from multidimensional NOE spectra recorded with mixing times ranging from 75 to 120 ms. NOE experiments included three-dimensional 15N-separated,13C-separated, and13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE spectra, and two-dimensional 15N-separated/13C-filtered,15N-filtered/13C-separated, and13C-filtered/15N-filtered NOE spectra (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Residual 1DNH,1DCαHα, and 1DNC′dipolar couplings were obtained by taking the difference in the corresponding J splittings measured in magnetically oriented and isotropic (in water) media. The orienting liquid crystalline medium employed consisted of a 4–5% C12E5 polyethylene glycol (PEG)/hexanol mixture with a surfactant to alcohol ratio of 0.96 (32Rückert M. Otting G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 12: 7793-7797Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar).1DNH couplings were measured on IIAMtl-HPr(15N) and IIAMtl(15N)-HPr complexes using two-dimensional in-phase/anti-phase {15N,1H} heteronuclear single quantum coherence experiments (33Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar).1DCαHα and 1DNC′couplings were measured on IIAMtl-HPr(15N/13C) and IIAMtl(15N/13C)-HPr complexes using three-dimensional (HCACO)NH and (TROSY)HNCO experiments (34Chou J.J. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 18: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), respectively. In all cases the concentration of labeled protein ranged from 0.6 to 1.0 mm, and the unlabeled protein was present in sufficient excess to ensure that the labeled protein was entirely in the bound state. The 1DNH dipolar couplings were measured in 5% PEG/hexanol using a different stock of PEG/hexanol from the 1DCαHα and1DNC′ dipolar couplings (which were measured in 4% PEG/hexanol). Consequently, two alignment tensors were employed: one for the 1DNH couplings and a second for the1DCαHα and 1DNC′couplings. The magnitude of the alignment tensor (i.e. the values of axial component of the tensor, DaNH, and the rhombicity η) was obtained by singular value decomposition (35Losonczi J.A. Andrec M. Fischer M.W. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 138: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 36Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 3791-3792Crossref Scopus (600) Google Scholar) using the x-ray coordinates of free IIAMtl (1A3A (11Van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L.C.E. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and HPr (1POH (37Jia Z. Quail J.W. Waygood E.B. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22490-22501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). The values of DaNHand η, determined in this manner, are −13.3 and 0.43 Hz, respectively, for the 1DNH set of dipolar couplings, and −9.4 and 0.58 Hz, respectively, for the1DCαHα and 1DNC′couplings. Note that small, unavoidable, variations in the concentration of PEG/hexanol among different samples only result in correspondingly small variations in the value of the axial component of the alignment tensor, DaNH. The dipolar couplings are appropriately normalized to reflect this. Intermolecular NOE-derived interproton distance restraints were classified into two ranges, 1.8–5.0 and 1.8–6.0 Å (17Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Intramolecular NOE-derived interproton distance restraints relating to the interfacial side chains were classified into four ranges as follows: 1.8–2.7, 1.8–3.5, 1.8–5.0, and 1.8–6.0 Å (38Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). An additional 0.5 Å was added to the upper bound for NOEs involving methyl groups, and distances involving methyl groups and non-stereospecifically assigned protons were represented by a (Σr −6)−1/6 sum. χ1and χ2 side chain torsion angle restraints were derived from analysis of heteronuclear 3 J couplings and NOE/(rotating frame Overhauser enhancement) experiments (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Backbone φ/ψ restraints for the four variable regions of IIAMtl were derived from backbone chemical shift data using the program TALOS (39Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) in conjunction with knowledge of the ranges for these φ/ψ angles observed in the four molecules of the crystal structure of free IIAMtl. Structures were calculated by conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics (40Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Clore G.M. Bewley C.A. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 154: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using the program Xplor-NIH (42Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). The target function minimized comprises the experimental NMR restraints (NOE-derived interproton distances, torsion angles, and residual dipolar couplings (43Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Tjandra N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar)), a repulsive van der Waals potential for the non-bonded contacts (36Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem.

Soc. 2002; 124: 2866-2867Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and a radius of gyration restraint to ensure optimal interfacial packing (45Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2337-2338Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Structures were visualized and analyzed with the programs VMD-XPLOR (46Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 149: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), RIBBONS (47Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (784) Google Scholar), and GRASP (48Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). Reweighted atomic density maps were calculated from the ensemble of simulated annealing structures as described previously (49Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence searches and alignments were carried out using the program BLAST (50Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). The coordinates and experimental restraints have been deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB accession code 1J6T). The physiological form of enzyme IIMtl consists of the three domains, A–C, joined together in a single polypeptide chain by flexible linkers of variable length (51Jacobson G.R. Lee C.A. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 249-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 52Lee C.A. Saier M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10761-10767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane-bound IICMtl domain is at the N terminus (residues 1–347), followed by the cytoplasmic IIBMtl (residues 348–489) with the IIAMtl(residues 490–637) domain at the C terminus (19Van Weeghel R.P.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1396-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The isolated IIAMtl domain is catalytically active and can accept a phosphoryl group from HPr and transfer it to both the isolated IIBMtl domain as well as IICBMtl (19Van Weeghel R.P. Meyer G.H. Keck W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 55Van Weeghel R.P. Meyer G.H. Pas H.H. Keck W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9478-9485Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have solved the structure of the IIAMtl-HPr complex by multidimensional NMR. For consistency with previous structural work (11Van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L.C.E. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 57Van Dijk A.A. Scheek R.M. Dijkstra K. Wolters G.K. Robillard G.T.

Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1331-1341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), residues 490–637 of IIMtl are numbered 1–148 in the cloned, expressed IIAMtl domain; hence, in this numbering scheme, the active site histidine (residue 554 in the full-length IIMtl sequence (59Pas H.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5835-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 60Van Weeghel R.P. van der Hoek Y.Y. Pas H.H. Elferink M. Keck W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) is located at position 65. IIAMtl and HPr are in fast exchange on the chemical shift scale. The equilibrium association constant derived from NMR titration studies by monitoring 1H-15N cross-peaks of15N-labeled IIAMtl upon addition of unlabeled HPr is ∼2 × 104m−1. The lower limit for the dissociation rate constant, derived from the maximal observed 1HN shift between free and bound states, is ∼4500 s−1. A combination of isotopically (15N and/or 13C) labeled proteins was used to simplify the spectra for assignment purposes and to specifically observe intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs) (26Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Trends Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 22-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). An example of the quality of the data is illustrated in Fig. 1 which shows a series of strips from three-dimensional13C-separated/12C-filtered NOE spectra in which NOEs are observed specifically from protons attached to 13C on one protein to protons attached to 12C on the other. High resolution crystal structures of both HPr ((37) code 1POH) and IIAMtl ((11) code 1A3A) are available and therefore permit the structure of the complex to be solved by conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics (40Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 41Clore G.M. Bewley C.A. J. Magn. Reson. 2002; 154: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), in a manner analogous to that employed for the HPr-IIAGlc complex (17Wang G. Louis J.M. Sondej M. Seok Y.-J. Peterkofsky A. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5635-5649Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In this approach, it is necessary to either demonstrate that no significant conformational changes occur upon complex formation or to localize regions where such changes may occur. This can be rapidly assessed by the measurement of residual dipolar couplings, which provide highly sensitive long range orientational information (61Tjandra N. Bax A. Science. 1997; 278: 1111-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 62Tjandra N. Omichinski J.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bax A. Nat. Struct.

Biol. 2001; 5: 584-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For HPr, agreement between observed 1DNHdipolar couplings measured on the complex dissolved in a dilute liquid crystalline medium of polyethylene glycol/hexanol (33Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar) and those calculated from the x-ray structure of free HPr is excellent with a1DNH dipolar coupling R-factor, RdipNH, of 19.1% and a correlation coefficient of 0.96, consistent with the expected accuracy of a 2-Å resolution crystal structure. The situation for IIAMtl is more complex, because the crystal structure has four molecules (A–D) in the unit cell (11Van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L.C.E. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1998; 6: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): molecules A and B, and molecules C and D are very similar with an overall backbone root mean square difference of ∼0.3 Å, consistent with the expected coordinate errors for a 1.8-Å resolution structure. However, the backbone of one region (I, residues 51–54) is displaced by up to ∼2 Å in molecule A relative to the other three molecules, and three regions (II, 66–78; III, 91–96; and IV, 104–110) exhibit maximal backbone displacements of up to 1.5–3 Å between the two pairs (A/B and C/D) of structures. Excluding these regions, the backbone root mean square difference between the four structures remains at ∼0.3 Å. For the invariant core residues (i.e. all residues with the exception of those in the four variable regions), the average values of RdipNH and the correlation coefficients are 20.5 ± 1.2% and 0.96 ± 0.05, respectively, for the four molecules. For the four variable regions, on the other hand, RdipNH and the correlation coefficient have values of 32% and 0.92 for molecule A, 29% and 0.93 for molecule B, 28% and 0.94 for molecule C, and 22% and 0.96 for molecule D. Thus, the overall agreement between the measured and calculated 1DNH dipolar couplings for the four variable regions in molecule D is essentially the same as that of the core residues, whereas the discrepancies for molecules A–C are significantly (∼50%) higher. The improvement for molecule D relative to the other three molecules is statistically significant, because it is larger than the intrinsic error, and implies that the structure of molecule D of IIAMtl is closest to that in the IIAMtl-HPr complex observed in solution. Because the variable regions I–IV of IIAMtl compose several residues (specifically residues 52–54, 68, 92, 93, 96, and 109) at the periphery of the interface with HPr, the following strategy was employed. The starting coordinates comprised the free x-ray structures of E. coli HPr (37Jia Z. Quail J.W. Waygood E.B. Delbaere L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22490-22501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IIAMtl(molecule D (11Van Montfort R.L. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Hangyi I. Kouwijzer M.L.C.E. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W.

https://openalex.org/W2076762099,"We exploited the high rate of homologous recombination shown by the chicken B cell line DT40 to inactivate the endogenous alleles for clathrin heavy chain and replace them with human clathrin complementary DNA under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. Clathrin repression perturbed the activities of Akt-mediated and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signaling pathways and induced apoptosis; this finding suggests that in DT40 cells clathrin helps to maintain the integrity of antiapoptotic survival pathways. We also describe a variant cell line in which these signaling pathways were unaffected by clathrin down-regulation. This variant cell line did not undergo apoptosis in the absence of clathrin and was used to examine the effects of clathrin depletion on membrane-trafficking pathways. Receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis were both substantially inhibited, and transferrin-receptor recycling was modestly inhibited. Surprisingly, clathrin removal did not affect the morphology or biochemical composition of lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2005966039,"To date, constitutively activating point mutations reported in hematopoietic growth factor receptors in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been restricted to receptors with intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity such as c-kit and FLT3. We describe here a Thr617Asn mutation in the transmembrane domain of the non-tyrosine kinase receptor for granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in the blast cells of two out of 555 AML patients examined. The mutant receptor conferred growth factor independence on factor-dependent Ba/F3 cells. In the absence of ligand, immunoblotting showed weak phosphorylation of JAK2, STAT3, ERKs 1 and 2 and the receptor itself, and there was approximately 70% of maximal growth in a proliferation assay. All signals were significantly enhanced in the presence of G-CSF. Retroviral transduction of mutant receptor into primary hematopoietic CD34+ cells induced G-CSF independent myeloid differentiation as assessed by the development of neutrophils and surface expression of CD11b and CD14. These results confirm the importance of the transmembrane domain for receptor function and suggest that introduction of an asparagine residue can cause sufficient stabilization of helix-helix interactions in the absence of ligand to activate downstream signaling pathways involved in directing proliferation and differentiation."

https://openalex.org/W1995003807,"Smad4 is an intracellular transmitter of TGF-beta signals and its tumor suppressor function is presumed to reside in its capacity to mediate TGF-beta-induced growth inhibition. However, there is accumulating evidence that this hypothesis may be too simple. The roles of TGF-beta in carcinogenesis are complex and also comprise tumor promoting functions particularly in late stage carcinogenesis. Importantly, functional inactivation of Smad4 in colon carcinomas frequently occurs at late stages when tumors acquire invasive and metastatic capabilities. We have previously reported that stable re-expression of Smad4 in SW480 human colon carcinoma cells was adequate to suppress tumor growth in nude mice. However, it did not affect cell growth in vitro nor did it restore TGF-beta responsiveness. Here, we report that Smad4 transcriptionally induced classical cadherins including the invasion suppressor E-cadherin, presumably re-establishing epithelial morphology. Smad4-induced cadherins were able to recruit catenins to the plasma membrane and were functionally active in cell-cell adhesion. These results indicate a novel pathway of Smad4-mediated tumor suppression and suggest that Smad4 in colon cells may be involved in the maintenance of epithelial traits."
https://openalex.org/W2054557691,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is known to activate multiple signaling pathways, resulting in diverse stress responses including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and gene induction. IR-activated cell cycle checkpoints are regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation, so we tested to see if protein phosphatases were targets of an IR-activated damage-sensing pathway. Jurkat cells were subjected to IR or sham radiation followed by brief32P metabolic labeling. Nuclear extracts were subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography to recover phosphatases, and the proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein sequencing revealed that the microcystin-bound proteins with the greatest reduction in 32P intensity following IR were the α and δ isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Both of these PP1 isoforms contain an Arg-Pro-Ile/Val-Thr-Pro-Pro-Arg sequence near the C terminus, a known site of phosphorylation by Cdc/Cdk kinases, and phosphorylation attenuates phosphatase activity. In wild-type Jurkat cells or ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells that are stably transfected with full-length ATM kinase, IR resulted in net dephosphorylation of this site in PP1 and produced activation of PP1. However, in AT cells that are deficient in ATM, IR failed to induce dephosphorylation or activation of PP1. IR-induced PP1 activation in the nucleus may be a critical component in an ATM-mediated pathway controlling checkpoint activation. Ionizing radiation (IR) is known to activate multiple signaling pathways, resulting in diverse stress responses including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and gene induction. IR-activated cell cycle checkpoints are regulated by Ser/Thr phosphorylation, so we tested to see if protein phosphatases were targets of an IR-activated damage-sensing pathway. Jurkat cells were subjected to IR or sham radiation followed by brief32P metabolic labeling. Nuclear extracts were subjected to microcystin affinity chromatography to recover phosphatases, and the proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Protein sequencing revealed that the microcystin-bound proteins with the greatest reduction in 32P intensity following IR were the α and δ isoforms of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). Both of these PP1 isoforms contain an Arg-Pro-Ile/Val-Thr-Pro-Pro-Arg sequence near the C terminus, a known site of phosphorylation by Cdc/Cdk kinases, and phosphorylation attenuates phosphatase activity. In wild-type Jurkat cells or ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells that are stably transfected with full-length ATM kinase, IR resulted in net dephosphorylation of this site in PP1 and produced activation of PP1. However, in AT cells that are deficient in ATM, IR failed to induce dephosphorylation or activation of PP1. IR-induced PP1 activation in the nucleus may be a critical component in an ATM-mediated pathway controlling checkpoint activation. ionizing radiation protein phosphatase 1 gray phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride Ionizing radiation (IR)1is known to activate multiple signaling pathways resulting in diverse stress responses including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and gene induction (1Liu V.F.

Many of these responses are controlled by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of Ser and Thr residues in proteins. PP1 is a major protein Ser/Thr phosphatase conserved among eukaryotic species that regulates a variety of key steps in metabolism, replication, transcription, and the cell cycle (3Cohen P.T. J.

Several lines of evidence suggest that in the absence of DNA damage, Rb is regulated by PP1. Mitotic extracts dephosphorylate Rb in the absence but not the presence of inhibitor 2, a protein specific for PP1 (11Tournebize R. Andersen S.S. Verde F. Doree M. Karsenti E. Hyman A.A.

Here we show that IR causes dephosphorylation of a Thr site in PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) resulting in activation of PP1. The IR-induced dephosphorylation of this site is shown to be dependent on ATM (mutated in ataxia telangiectasia), the gene product that is deficient in the human autosomal recessive disease.DISCUSSIONIR is known to activate the G1, S, and G2checkpoints (2Larner J.M.

TheATM gene is mutated in the autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia, characterized by neuronal degeneration resulting in ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, immune dysfunction, and cancer predisposition (28Lavin M.F. Shiloh Y. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ATM is thought to be an upstream sensor of DNA damage as well as oxidative stress. ATM transmits the damage signal downstream through its C-terminal phosphoinositol 3-kinase domain. ATM has been shown to directly phosphorylate several proteins and to enhance the phosphorylation of other proteins by activating downstream protein kinases. These targets include the nuclear tyrosine kinase c-Abl, Chk2, nibrin, p53, and BRCA1, all of which have been implicated in DNA damage responses (29Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Kedar P. Spring K. Kozlov S.

Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and to regulate H1 dephosphorylation following IR. Thus, ATM activates the phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylating H1 and p53. We have recently demonstrated that IR causes dissociation of the B55α regulatory subunit, which has been implicated in mitotic progression, from heterotrimeric nuclear PP2A in an ATM-dependent manner (38Guo C.Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of IR-induced dissociation of B55α from PP2A heterotrimer is unknown, it is likely that IR-induced subunit exchange allows PP2A to execute diverse functions in the damage response. PP1 and PP2A are both downstream effectors of an IR-activated and ATM-dependent signaling pathway. It seems likely that IR-induced PP1 activation as well as PP2A subunit exchange requires the function of the kinase domain of ATM, but this remains to be determined.We imagine two potential but not mutually exclusive mechanisms by which ATM could regulate PP1 activity. First, ATM is known to inhibit Cdc2 and Cdk2 in response to IR. The PP1 Thr-320 site is phosphorylated by Cdc2/Cdk2. Thus, IR-activated ATM could increase PP1 activity indirectly through inactivation of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of Thr-320. Because ATM has recently been shown to regulate Cdc25A (the activator of Cdk2) through Chk2, it is possible that ATM regulates PP1 through the Chk2-Cdc25A pathway. If this were the case, then a dual specificity phosphatase (Cdc25) would be regulating another phosphatase (PP1) via a phosphatase-kinase-phosphatase cascade (Cdc25-Cdk2-PP1). Our data do not establish that Cdk2 is the in vivo kinase of PP1. There may be other kinases that phosphorylate the Thr-320 site in PP1, but they would also need to be regulated in response to IR by an ATM-dependent pathway. Alternatively, ATM could directly (or indirectly) phosphorylate a nuclear PP1 subunit that restrains PP1 in its phosphorylated, low activity form. Phosphorylation would release inhibition and allow autodephosphorylation of Thr-320 and activation of PP1 toward other substrates. NIPP is one example of a nuclear PP1 regulatory subunit whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation (35Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32972-32978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).What are the downstream nuclear substrates of PP1 that may be critical in the damage response? Unlike protein serine/threonine kinases, PP1 catalytic subunit does not manifest a high degree of sequence specificity and dephosphorylates multiple substrates. The substrate specificity of PP1 is thought to be modulated through the formation of heterodimeric complexes with regulatory subunits. Regulatory proteins that target PP1 to its substrates in response to DNA damage are not known, and these may bind both α and δ isoforms or there may be individual regulatory subunits for these isoforms. Specific PP1 isoforms have been shown to have distinct functions and locations. For example, the PP1α isoform has been shown to regulate the G1/S transition by dephosphorylating Rb (12Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PP1δ isoform is chromatin-associated. Because histone H1 and histone H3 have been implicated as PP1 substrates (14Guo C.Y. Wang Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18715-18720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Murnion M.E. Adams R.R. Callister D.M. Allis C.D. Earnshaw W.C. Swedlow J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the PP1δ isoform may regulate IR-induced H1 and H3 dephosphorylation.In summary, the PP1 α and δ isoforms are dynamically phosphorylated in Jurkat cells and in response to IR become activated by dephosphorylation of Thr-320 to function as a downstream effector of an ATM-dependent damage-sensing pathway. Regardless of the mechanism by which ATM activates PP1, defining the regulatory subunits that target PP1 to its respective substrates may reveal novel targets for chemo and radiation sensitizers. Drugs that function at the level of these targets may have low toxicity and, therefore, be more efficacious than less specific inhibitors. Ionizing radiation (IR)1is known to activate multiple signaling pathways resulting in diverse stress responses including apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and gene induction (1Liu V.F. Boubnov N.V.

Interestingly, ATM has also been shown to control the damage-induced dephosphorylation of Ser-376 in p53 (34Waterman M.J. Stavridi E.S. Waterman J.L. Halazonetis T.D. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) and to regulate H1 dephosphorylation following IR. Thus, ATM activates the phosphatase(s) responsible for dephosphorylating H1 and p53. We have recently demonstrated that IR causes dissociation of the B55α regulatory subunit, which has been implicated in mitotic progression, from heterotrimeric nuclear PP2A in an ATM-dependent manner (38Guo C.Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the functional significance of IR-induced dissociation of B55α from PP2A heterotrimer is unknown, it is likely that IR-induced subunit exchange allows PP2A to execute diverse functions in the damage response. PP1 and PP2A are both downstream effectors of an IR-activated and ATM-dependent signaling pathway. It seems likely that IR-induced PP1 activation as well as PP2A subunit exchange requires the function of the kinase domain of ATM, but this remains to be determined. We imagine two potential but not mutually exclusive mechanisms by which ATM could regulate PP1 activity. First, ATM is known to inhibit Cdc2 and Cdk2 in response to IR. The PP1 Thr-320 site is phosphorylated by Cdc2/Cdk2. Thus, IR-activated ATM could increase PP1 activity indirectly through inactivation of Cdc2/Cdk2 kinase, thereby decreasing the phosphorylation of Thr-320. Because ATM has recently been shown to regulate Cdc25A (the activator of Cdk2) through Chk2, it is possible that ATM regulates PP1 through the Chk2-Cdc25A pathway. If this were the case, then a dual specificity phosphatase (Cdc25) would be regulating another phosphatase (PP1) via a phosphatase-kinase-phosphatase cascade (Cdc25-Cdk2-PP1). Our data do not establish that Cdk2 is the in vivo kinase of PP1. There may be other kinases that phosphorylate the Thr-320 site in PP1, but they would also need to be regulated in response to IR by an ATM-dependent pathway. Alternatively, ATM could directly (or indirectly) phosphorylate a nuclear PP1 subunit that restrains PP1 in its phosphorylated, low activity form. Phosphorylation would release inhibition and allow autodephosphorylation of Thr-320 and activation of PP1 toward other substrates. NIPP is one example of a nuclear PP1 regulatory subunit whose activity is regulated by phosphorylation (35Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Waelkens E. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32972-32978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 36Van Eynde A. Wera S. Beullens M. Torrekens S. Van Leuven F. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28068-28074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). What are the downstream nuclear substrates of PP1 that may be critical in the damage response? Unlike protein serine/threonine kinases, PP1 catalytic subunit does not manifest a high degree of sequence specificity and dephosphorylates multiple substrates. The substrate specificity of PP1 is thought to be modulated through the formation of heterodimeric complexes with regulatory subunits. Regulatory proteins that target PP1 to its substrates in response to DNA damage are not known, and these may bind both α and δ isoforms or there may be individual regulatory subunits for these isoforms. Specific PP1 isoforms have been shown to have distinct functions and locations. For example, the PP1α isoform has been shown to regulate the G1/S transition by dephosphorylating Rb (12Berndt N. Dohadwala M. Liu C.W. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the PP1δ isoform is chromatin-associated. Because histone H1 and histone H3 have been implicated as PP1 substrates (14Guo C.Y. Wang Y. Brautigan D.L. Larner J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18715-18720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Murnion M.E. Adams R.R. Callister D.M. Allis C.D. Earnshaw W.C. Swedlow J.R. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1437-1447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is likely that the PP1δ isoform may regulate IR-induced H1 and H3 dephosphorylation. In summary, the PP1 α and δ isoforms are dynamically phosphorylated in Jurkat cells and in response to IR become activated by dephosphorylation of Thr-320 to function as a downstream effector of an ATM-dependent damage-sensing pathway. Regardless of the mechanism by which ATM activates PP1, defining the regulatory subunits that target PP1 to its respective substrates may reveal novel targets for chemo and radiation sensitizers. Drugs that function at the level of these targets may have low toxicity and, therefore, be more efficacious than less specific inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2334572212,"The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are believed to mediate their anticancer effects by inducing apoptosis but the molecular mechanisms of their apoptotic effects remain largely unknown. Here we report that two different NSAIDs, sulindac sulfide and SC-'236 engage the death receptor 5 (DR5) and mitochondrial pathways to mediate apoptosis in human colon cancer cells. We show that sulindac sulfide and SC-'236-induced apoptosis is coupled with upregulation of DR5, caspase 8 activation and Bid cleavage. Thus, a cross talk appears to exist between the DR5 and mitochondrial pathways during apoptosis induced by these NSAIDs. We further show that sulindac sulfide and SC-'236-induced DR5 upregulation occurs independent of the COX inhibitory effects of these NSAIDs. Using Bax-proficient (Bax+/-) and Bax-deficient (Bax-/-) HCT116 human colon cancer cells, we further demonstrate that Apo2L/TRAIL differentially modulates the apoptotic effects of sulindac sulfide and SC-'236. For example, sulindac sulfide upregulates DR5 in both Bax-deficient and proficient cells, but Apo2L/TRAIL efficiently potentiates sulindac sulfide-induced apoptosis as well as activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 only in Bax-proficient cells. SC-'236 also upregulates DR5 in both Bax-proficient and Bax-deficient cells but Apo2L/TRAIL potentiates SC-'236-mediated apoptosis and caspases-8 and -3 activation in both Bax-proficient and Bax-deficient cells. Further, in Bax-deficient cells, neither sulindac sulfide nor SC-'236 in combination with Apo2L/TRAIL effectively promotes the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into cytosol and caspase-9 activation. Collectively, our results suggest that unlike sulindac sulfide, SC-'236 in combination with Apo2L/TRAIL can overcome Bax deficiency to induce apoptosis. These results have important clinical implications in that the tumors harboring Bax mutations are likely to develop resistance to sulindac but not to SC-'236-like NSAIDs. In conclusion, the data presented herein form the basis of future in-depth studies to further explore the utility of Apo2L/TRAIL and NSAIDs, in combination, as a novel cancer preventive/therapeutic strategy."

Although Fks1p and Fks2p are highly homologous, sharing 88.1% identity, it has been shown that Fks2p is more sensitive than Fks1p to one of echinocandin derivatives, which inhibits β-1,3-glucan synthase activity. Here we show a similar differential sensitivity between Fks1p and Fks2p to a novel β-1,3-glucan synthase inhibitor, aerothricin1. To investigate the molecular mechanism of this differential sensitivity, we constructed a series of chimeric genes ofFKSs and examined their sensitivity to aerothricin1. As a result, it was shown that a region around the fourth extracellular domain of Fks2p, containing 10 different amino acid residues from those of Fks1p, provided Fks1p aerothricin1 sensitivity when the region was replaced with a corresponding region of Fks1p. In order to identify essential amino acid residues responsible for the sensitivity, each of the 10 non-conserved amino acids of Fks1p was substituted into the corresponding amino acid of Fks2p by site-directed mutagenesis. Surprisingly, only one amino acid substitution of Fks1p (K1336I) conferred Fks1p hypersensitivity to aerothricin1. On the other hand, reverse substitution of the corresponding amino acid of Fks2p (I1355K) resulted in loss of hypersensitivity to aerothricin1.

For region D of FKS2, 5′-TTTTGGGCCCTTTCAGAATTACTGACACCGAAAGCTGCTCCG-3′ and 5′-TTTTGGGCCCCAGAAAAGATTAAGATCAAATTTGACGG-3′ were used. These intermediate fragments were mixed in the second round PCR to produce C-terminal chimeric fragments, and each of these was inserted intoSalI-ApaI sites of pRS414-pT containing the N-terminal region of FKS1 or FKS2. For the third series of chimeric mutants, constructions were performed with the same method described above. In the first step, intermediate fragments corresponding to regions E–G of Fks1p and Fks2p were amplified by PCR with primers 5′-CGTAGACGTCCCAAGTTTAGAGTTCAATTATC-3′ and 5′-GAAAATAGACAATGTATAACGTCTCACCCAATC-3′ for region E, 5′-GATTGGGTGAGACGTTATACATTGTCTATTTTC-3′ and 5′-GCCAATGTGCGACAGTACCGAACAGCAACATTAACATTG-3′ for region F, and 5′-CAATGTTAATGTTGCTGTTCGGTACTGTCGCACATTGGC-3′ and 5′-GATTGGCGCCAAGGTACAAATGATGATACG-3′ for region G. In the second step, the components were mixed and amplified, generating chimeric fragments with an AatII and a BbeI site at each end. Original AatII-BbeI fragments ofFKS1 and FKS2 were replaced with the resulting chimeric fragments, FKS1-E2, -F2, and-G2, and FKS2-E1. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the oligonucleotide-directed dual amber method (Takara Ltd., Mutan-express Km). First, AatII and BbeI restriction sites were introduced into the multicloning site of pKF18k (Takara Ltd.) by inserting preannealed primers (5′-AATTCTAGGACGTCGTAGGGGCGCCTAGA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTCTAGGCGCCCCTACGACGTCCTAG-3′), generating pKF18k-AB, a vector for mutagenesis. Then AatII-BbeI fragments of FKS1 and FKS2 containing target amino acids for the mutagenesis were inserted into the pKF18-AB. The mutagenesis was done as recommended by manufacturer with the following primers: 5′-TAGGAAACGGTCaAtTGGTAATTGGGT-3′ forFKS1 V1284I; 5′-TGGGCCAAGGAAtgTAAATTCACCAA-3′ forFKS1 S1319H; 5′-TTCATGGGCCAAaGcAGATAAATTCAC-3′ for FKS1 S1320A; 5′-CGTAAATACACAgAATAGATTCATG-3′ for FKS1 M1327L; 5′-TCCTATCGTAAAcACACATAATAGA-3′ for FKS1 I1329V; 5′-TGTTTTTGGTTTaTcCCTATCGTAAAT-3′ forFKS1 N1333D; 5′-CAAAACATCTGTaaTTGGTTTGTTCC-3′ forFKS1 K1336I; 5′-CACCCAATTGGAtaCAAAACATCTGT-3′ forFKS1 V1341Y; 5′-ATCAACCGCAGGaTGGAAGTTGTAA-3′ forFKS1 Q1349H; 5′-TCACCCAATCAAtCGCAGGTTGGAA-3′ forFKS1 V1352I; and 5′-CAAAACATCAGTttTTGGCTTATCCC-3′ forFKS2 I1355K. Introduced mutations, shown in lowercase in the primer sequences, were confirmed by sequencing. After that an original AatII-BbeI fragment ofFKS1 or FKS2 on the pRS414pT was replaced with each of the mutated AatII-BbeI fragments. Cycloheximide and 5′-fluoroorotic acid was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. Aerothricin1 was prepared as described previously (24Aoki, M., Kohchi, M., Masubuchi, K., Mizuguchi, E., Murata, T., Ohkuma, H., Okada, T., Sakaitani, M., Shimma, N., Watanabe, T., Tyanagisawa, M., and Yasuda, Y. (2001) Patent WO/0005251.Google Scholar). Restriction endonucleases and Taq polymerase were purchased from Takara Ltd. Yeast transformation, plasmid shuffling, PCR method, and gene manipulation were performed as described previously (28). DNA sequencing was done by using an automated DNA sequencer model 373A with a Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core kit (Applied Biosystems). Sequence data were analyzed with GENETYX for windows version 4.0.1.0 (Software Development Co., Ltd.). Growth inhibition was determined in a standard microdilution assay. Briefly, 104cells were cultivated with 100 μl of medium on 96-well microtiter plates at 30 °C for 16–24 h in the presence or absence of antifungal compounds. An A 595 of the exponentially growing cells in the 96-well plates was measured by EIA-reader (Bio-Rad). IC50 values refer to the compound concentrations that gave 50% inhibition of cell growth compared with the control. A spotting assay was performed by spotting 104cells onto YPD agar plates containing aerothricin1 at different concentrations from 0.003 to 1 μg/ml. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)2 was determined after overnight incubation of the spotted plates at 30 °C. Membrane preparation and partial purification of β-1,3-glucan synthase were done as previously described (16Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M. Anraku Y. Zheng Y. Watanabe T. Levin D.E. Ohya Y. Science. 1996; 272: 279-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). β-1,3-Glucan synthase activity measurement was done as reported previously (19Kondoh O. Tachibana Y. Ohya Y. Arisawa M. Watanabe T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7734-7741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membrane fractions were prepared from late log phase cells, and the enzyme was then partially purified by the product entrapment. About 30–40 ng of the purified enzymes was incubated in the reaction buffer containing 0.1 mmUDP-[6-3H]glucose (222 Bq, Amersham Biosciences), 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.75 mm EDTA, 25 mm KF, 20 μm GTPγS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 7.8% glycerol in 100 μl at 25 °C for 30 min. After filtration and two steps of washing with 70% ethanol, radiolabeled glucose incorporated into polymerized glucan on the filter was quantified by counting the radioactivity (MicroBeta; Wallac). It is known that S. cerevisiae fks1Δ mutant is more sensitive to L-733,560, one of the echinocandin derivatives, than the wild type strain (6Douglas C.M. Foor F. Marrinan J.A. Morin N. Nielsen J.B. Dahl A.M. Mazur P. Baginsky W., Li, W. el-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. Mandala S.M. Frommer B.R. Kurtz M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12907-12911Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). This differential sensitivity is thought to be due to biochemical characteristics of Fks2p, which is more sensitive to this compound than Fks1p (10Mazur P. Morin N. Baginsky W. el-Sherbeini M. Clemas J.A. Nielsen J.B. Foor F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5671-5681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These lines of evidence intrigued us to test the antifungal activity of aerothricin1 (Fig. 1), a novel β-1,3-glucan synthase inhibitor, against both fks1D and fks2D null mutants. As shown in Table I, thefks1Δ null mutant appeared to be more sensitive to aerothricin1 than the fks2Δ null mutant or the parental wild type strain A451.Table IAerothricin1 sensitivity of S. cerevisiae fks null mutantsGenotype of host cellPlasmidExpressed FkspGrowth inhibition IC50Aerothricin1Cycloheximideμg/mlWild typeNoneFks1p, Fks2p0.12 (± 0.0050)0.030 (± 0.0012)fks1NoneFks2p0.0033 (± 0.0011)0.027 (± 0.00058)fks2NoneFks1p0.16 (± 0.0036)0.028 (± 0.0017)fks1, fks2GAPp-FKS1Fks1p0.39 (± 0.068)0.045 (± 0.0012)fks1, fks2GAPp-FKS2Fks2p0.029 (± 0.0032)0.038 (± 0.0013)Growth inhibition was measured by microdilution assay. 104cells of fks null mutants were cultivated with 100 μl of medium on 96-well microtiter plates at 30 °C for 16–24 h in the presence or absence of antifungal compounds.

Open table in a new tab Growth inhibition was measured by microdilution assay. 104cells of fks null mutants were cultivated with 100 μl of medium on 96-well microtiter plates at 30 °C for 16–24 h in the presence or absence of antifungal compounds. Values represent the mean IC50 values, referring to the compound concentrations that gave 50% inhibition of cell growth compared with the control, in three experiments and ± S.D. In an attempt to address this differential sensitivity more precisely, each of the FKS1 and FKS2 expression plasmids was introduced into the fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant harboring the URA3-borne GALp-FKS1plasmid, and this plasmid was then eliminated by 5′-fluoroorotic acid treatment. In the resultant cells, either the FKS1 orFKS2 gene can be expressed in the absence of endogenous Fks1p and Fks2p under the control of a constitutive GAP promoter (29Sudoh M. Shimada H. Arisawa M. Yano K. Takagi M. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1991; 11: 2901-2903Google Scholar). The introduction of either GAPp-driven FKS1 or GAPp-driven FKS2 suppressed the lethal phenotype of S. cerevisiae fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant, and the resulting mutant showed the same growth rate as the parental wild type strain, YPH499 (data not shown). At first, we confirmed the differential sensitivity between the two strains. As shown in Table I, the double null mutant expressing only Fks2p was more sensitive to aerothricin1 than that expressing only Fks1p. We also questioned whether they showed a differential sensitivity against another type of antifungal agent, cycloheximide. However, we observed no clear difference in their sensitivities against this agent (Table I). These results suggest that this differential sensitivity against aerothricin1 may simply rely on differences between Fks1p and Fks2p. Based on the hypothesis that differences in the primary sequences of Fks1p and Fks2p may represent determinants for the aerothricin1 sensitivity, we first looked at the intracellular domain at the N terminus of Fks2p because this region is less homologous, even though Fks1p and Fks2p exhibit 88.1% identity throughout overall sequences. For this purpose, two kinds of chimeric genes, FKS1-A2 and FKS2-A1, were constructed by replacing the N-terminal region (Fig. 3, A and B) and introduced into the fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant under the control of the GAP promoter. For a rapid profiling of their sensitivities, we applied a spotting assay with plates containing different concentrations of aerothricin1. Although aerothricin1 sensitivities were determined as MICs in this assay (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig.2), we could see the same differential sensitivity as seen in the comparison of IC50 values against the double null mutant cells expressing either Fks1p or Fks2p (Table I). Both chimeric proteins, Fks1-A2p and Fks2-A1p, appeared to suppress the synthetic lethal phenotype of fks1Δ fks2Δdouble null mutant because no growth defects observed compared with the parent strain YPH499 (data not shown). As shown in Fig.3 B, the spotting assay revealed that Fks1-A2p failed to confer the mutant cells hypersensitive to aerothricin1. Surprisingly, the mutant cells expressing Fks2-A1p showed Fks2p-like sensitivity. These results indicate that the determinant(s) may exist in the C-terminal region of Fks2p, which is highly conserved between Fks1p and Fks2p, sharing 92.5% identity. To minimize regions containing the determinant(s), we performed the second round of chimeric gene analysis. As illustrated in Fig.3 A, the sequence encoding the C-terminal region of Fks2p was divided into three regions, named B, C, and D. Each of them was replaced with the corresponding region of FKS1 gene, resulting in chimeric genes FKS1-B2, FKS1-C2, andFKS1-D2. Mutant cells harboring each chimeric gene also grew normally (data not shown). By the spotting assay, it was shown that only Fks1-C2p conferred the mutant cells hypersensitive to aerothricin1 (Fig. 3 B). We also tested an opposite substitution, Fks2-C1p, in which the region C of Fks2p was replaced with that of Fks1p (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the replacement of region C in Fks2p resulted in a loss of hypersensitivity to aerothricin1 (Fig.3 B), suggesting that region C of Fks2p contains the determinant(s) of differential sensitivity to aerothricin1. To localize a region containing the determinant(s) more precisely, we further divided a portion of Fks2p including region C into three parts (region E, F, G in Fig. 3 A) and constructed chimeric genes by replacing the cognate region in FKS1 with that of FKS2 gene. Finally, it was found that an introduction of region E of Fks2p into Fks1p was enough to provide the aerothricin1 sensitivity to the mutant cells (Fig. 3 B,FKS1-E2). Conversely, Fks2p harboring a replacement of region E failed to confer the mutant cells sensitive to the inhibitor (Fig. 3 B, FKS2-E1). From a series of analyses using chimeric proteins, it was suggested that determinant(s) could be located within a region shared by regions C and E (Fig. 4 A). The shared region consists of 74 amino acids and contains 10 non-conservative amino acids between Fks1p and Fks2p (86.5% identical). Identification of these non-conservative amino acids prompted us to question which amino acid was essential for the aerothricin1 sensitivity of Fks2p. For this purpose, we mutagenized each of them in Fks1p with that of Fks2p by using site-directed mutagenesis. All 10 Fks1 mutant proteins were analyzed in thefks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant cells with the spotting assay. Surprisingly, as summarized in Fig. 4 B, only one mutant Fks1p (FKS1K1336I) conferred the cells sensitive to aerothricin1. We also examined the effects of substitution of the corresponding amino acid residue of Fks2p with that of Fks1p and found that this opposite substitution resulted in a complete loss of the aerothricin1 hypersensitivity (Fig. 4 B,FKS2I1355K). The switching of the sensitivity due to these substitutions was further confirmed by determination of IC50 values of aerothricin1 against the fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant cells expressing each mutant protein (Table II). Although IC50values of echinocandin B against these cells were also determined, no clear difference was observed in their sensitivities.Table IIAerothrisin1 sensitivity of Fks1K1336Ip and Fks2I1335Kp mutantsPlasmidGrowth inhibitionGlucan synthase activityAerothricin1 IC50Echinocandin B IC50Specific activityAerothricin1 IC50μg/mlpmol/mg protein/hμg/mlGAPp-FKS10.39 (± 0.068)1.8 (± 0.061)64 (± 5.0)5.3 (± 1.9)GAPp-FKS1 K1336I0.052 (± 0.020)3.0 (± 0.038)79 (± 2.8)0.091 (± 0.010)GAPp-FKS20.029 (± 0.0032)1.1 (± 0.15)39 (± 4.5)0.099 (± 0.011)GAPp-FKS2 I1355K0.66 (± 0.029)0.45 (± 0.027)22 (± 2.8)1.1 (± 0.15)Growth inhibition was measured by microdilution assay. 104cells of site-directed mutants expressingGAPp-FKS1 K1336I orGAPp-FKS2 I1355K were cultivated with 100 μl of medium on 96-well microtiter plates at 30 °C for 16–24 h in the presence or absence of antifungal compounds.

Specific activity and sensitivity to Aerothricin1 were determined, and values represent the mean values in three experiments and ± S.D. Next we investigated the effects of substitutions on biochemical properties of Fks1p and Fks2p. β-1,3-Glucan synthase complexes containing the mutant catalytic subunits were partially purified from the fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant cells expressing each of the mutants Fks1p and Fks2p, and then their sensitivities to aerothricin1 were examined. As shown in Table II, both mutated Fks1K1336Ip and Fks2I1355Kp revealed similar specific activities compared with their wild type proteins. Judging from IC50 values, however, it was shown that Fks1K1336Ip was over 50-fold more sensitive to aerothricin1 than Fks1p. On the other hand, Fks2I1355Kp appeared to be more resistant to aerothricin1 than Fks2p, the same as Fks1p. These results imply that one isoleucine residue at the position 1355 of Fks2p is one of the determinants for aerothricin1 sensitivity. Aerothricin1/RO0093655, identical to FR901469, is a potent and selective antifungal agent inhibiting the synthesis of β-1,3-glucan, which is a main component of fungal cell wall. Although it has been shown that aerothricin1 inhibits in vitro β-1,3-glucan synthesis of C. albicans and growth of various fungi, such as several Candida species and A. fumigatus(22Masubuchi K.

(Tokyo). 2000; 53: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the detailed molecular mechanisms of the inhibition are still unknown. In this report, we found that the fks1 null mutant was more sensitive to aerothricin1 than either the fks2 null mutant or the parental strain in S. cerevisiae. This observation is the first evidence suggesting that the catalytic subunit of β-1,3-glucan synthase would be a molecular target of aerothricin1. In the course of our experiments shown here, we initially used a number of chimeric Fks proteins. Surprisingly, none of them resulted in impaired growth when expressed in the fks1Δ fks2Δ double null mutant of S. cerevisiae. These results indicate not only that these chimeric proteins are functional but also that Fks1p and Fks2p are highly structurally homologous. Although we cannot exclude a possibility that other amino acid residues are involved in the aerothricin1 sensitivity of Fks2p, several lines of evidence presented here demonstrate that one amino acid residue, Ile-1355 of Fks2p, is one dominant determinant for its aerothricin1 sensitivity. Alternatively, Lys-1336 of Fks1p is the dominant one for the resistance to aerothricin1. One possible explanation of these determinant residues in the interaction with aerothricin1 is that their charges may affect affinity between Fks proteins and aerothricin1; a positive charge of the 1336th lysine residue of Fks1p may interfere with the interaction of aerothricin1 with Fks1p molecules, because aerothricin1 has a positive-charged nitrogen at the ornithine moiety (Fig. 1), which is essential for its inhibition activity (data not shown). Alternatively, the hydrophobicity of the 1355th isoleucine residue of Fks1p may be important for the aerothricin1 association. Aerothricin1 exhibits growth inhibition effectively against at leastC. albicans and A. fumigatus (24Aoki, M., Kohchi, M., Masubuchi, K., Mizuguchi, E., Murata, T., Ohkuma, H., Okada, T., Sakaitani, M., Shimma, N., Watanabe, T., Tyanagisawa, M., and Yasuda, Y.

F-155.Google Scholar); the IC50 values against C. albicans ATCC48130 andA. fumigatus CF1003 were 0.03 and 0.06 μg/ml, respectively. As shown in Fig. 5, primary structures of the fourth extracellular domains, including the determinant residue, are conserved among these fungi. Interestingly, positions of the expected determinant are occupied with isoleucine or valine residues, which are non-charged and hydrophobic, supporting the importance of the hydrophobic residue of Fks2p for aerothricin1 interaction. It is interesting to question whether A. nidulans and P. brasiliensis are sensitive to this compound because the region including the determinant residue is also highly conserved and possesses the determinant isoleucine residue.C. neoformans is known to be less sensitive to aerothricin1 in growth inhibition assay (25Fujie, A., Hori, Y., Iwamoto, T., Hatanaka, H., Hino, M., Hashimoto, S., Okuhara, M., Proceedings of the 38th Inter-science Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, San Diego, CA, 1998, American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D.C., September 24–27, 1998, Abstr. F-155.Google Scholar) even though we can find an isoleucine residue in its Fks1p at the same position when aligned with Fks proteins from other sensitive fungi (Fig. 5). However, its sequence similarity is quite low against other Fks proteins, suggesting the region is structurally different from other Fks proteins. Echinocandins share similar features with aerothricin1 in their chemical structure, such as cyclic macropeptides with a lipophilic side chain. In particular, S. cerevisiae Fks1p and Fks2p exhibit differential sensitivities against both types of inhibitors. Therefore, it is possible that they may share domains that interact with Fks proteins. However, it is unlikely that they share the same determinant(s) for their differential sensitivities because we failed to find any clear differences in the sensitivities of point-mutated Fks proteins (Table II). In addition, Fks1-A2p was more sensitive to echinocandin B than Fks1p, Fks2p, or Fks2-A1p (data not shown). These observations suggest that aerothricin1 and the echinocandins may interact differently with catalytic subunits via different determinant residue(s). By investigating the differential aerothricin1 sensitivity between Fks1p and Fks2p, we obtained a clue for understanding the mechanism of inhibition of β-1,3-glucan synthesis by aerothricin1. For further analysis of the aerothricin1 inhibition, focus should be on the fourth extracellular domain. Monitoring a direct interaction between aerothricin1 and the fourth extracellular domain might be useful in understanding the actual physical relationship between aerothricin1 and the catalytic subunits of β-1,3-glucan synthase. These results would be helpful for developing more potent derivatives from aerothricin1. We thank Prof. Y. Ohya, University of Tokyo, for kindly giving us the strain YOC793. We also thank Drs. S.

https://openalex.org/W1981355975,"This report describes the identification of a novel protein named PS1D (Genbank accession number ), which is composed of an S1-like RNA-binding domain, a (cysteine)x3-(histidine) CCCH-zinc finger, and a very basic carboxyl domain. PS1D is expressed as two isoforms, probably resulting from the alternative splicing of mRNA. The long PS1D isoform differs from the short one by the presence of 48 additional amino acids at its amino-terminal extremity. Analysis of PS1D subcellular distribution by cell fractionation reveals that this protein belongs to the core of the eukaryotic 60S ribosomal subunit. Interestingly, PS1D protein is a highly conserved protein among mammalians as murine, human, and simian PS1D homologues share more than 95% identity. In contrast, no homologous protein is found in lower eukaryotes such as yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. These observations indicate that PS1D is the first eukaryotic ribosomal protein that is specific to higher eukaryotes."
