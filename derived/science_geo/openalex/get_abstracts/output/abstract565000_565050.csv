https://openalex.org/W2505134980,"INTRODUCTION Condensed-matter systems have recently become a fertile ground for the discovery of fermionic particles and phenomena predicted in high-energy physics; examples include Majorana fermions, as well as Dirac and Weyl semimetals. However, fermions in condensed-matter systems are not constrained by Poincare symmetry. Instead, they must only respect the crystal symmetry of one of the 230 space groups. Hence, there is the potential to find and classify free fermionic excitations in solid-state systems that have no high-energy counterparts. RATIONALE The guiding principle of our classification is to find irreducible representations of the little group of lattice symmetries at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone (BZ) for each of the 230 space groups (SGs), the dimension of which corresponds to the number of bands that meet at the high-symmetry point. Because we are interested in systems with spin-orbit coupling, we considered only the double-valued representations, where a 2π rotation gives a minus sign. Furthermore, we considered systems with time-reversal symmetry that squares to –1. For each unconventional representation, we computed the low-energy k · p Hamiltonian near the band crossings by writing down all terms allowed by the crystal symmetry. This allows us to further differentiate the band crossings by the degeneracy along lines and planes that emanate from the high-symmetry point, and also to compute topological invariants. For point degeneracies, we computed the monopole charge of the band-crossing; for line nodes, we computed the Berry phase of loops encircling the nodes. RESULTS We found that three space groups exhibit symmetry-protected three-band crossings. In two cases, this results in a threefold degenerate point node, whereas the third case results in a line node away from the high-symmetry point. These crossings are required to have a nonzero Chern number and hence display surface Fermi arcs. However, upon applying a magnetic field, they have an unusual Landau level structure, which distinguishes them from single and double Weyl points. Under the action of spatial symmetries, these fermions transform as spin-1 particles, as a consequence of the interplay between nonsymmorphic space group symmetries and spin. Additionally, we found that six space groups can host sixfold degeneracies. Two of these consist of two threefold degeneracies with opposite chirality, forced to be degenerate by the combination of time reversal and inversion symmetry, and can be described as “sixfold Dirac points.” The other four are distinct. Furthermore, seven space groups can host eightfold degeneracies. In two cases, the eightfold degeneracies are required; all bands come in groups of eight that cross at a particular point in the BZ. These two cases also exhibit fourfold degenerate line nodes, from which other semimetals can be derived: By adding strain or a magnetic field, these line nodes split into Weyl, Dirac, or line node semimetals. For all the three-, six- and eight-band crossings, nonsymmorphic symmetries play a crucial role in protecting the band crossing. Last, we found that seven space groups may host fourfold degenerate “spin-3/2” fermions at high symmetry points. Like their spin-1 counterparts, these quasiparticles host Fermi surfaces with nonzero Chern number. Unlike the other cases we considered, however, these fermions can be stabilized by both symmorphic and nonsymmorphic symmetries. Three space groups that host these excitations also host unconventional fermions at other points in the BZ. We propose nearly 40 candidate materials that realize each type of fermion near the Fermi level, as verified with ab initio calculations. Seventeen of these have been previously synthesized in single-crystal form, whereas others have been reported in powder form. CONCLUSION We have analyzed all types of fermions that can occur in spin-orbit coupled crystals with time-reversal symmetry and explored their topological properties. We found that there are several distinct types of such unconventional excitations, which are differentiated by their degeneracies at and along high-symmetry points, lines, and surfaces. We found natural generalizations of Weyl points: three- and four-band crossings described by a simple k · S Hamiltonian, where S i is the set of spin generators in either the spin-1 or spin-3/2 representations. These points carry a Chern number and, consequently, can exhibit Fermi arc surface states. We also found excitations with six- and eightfold degeneracies. These higher-band crossings create a tunable platform to realize topological semimetals by applying an external magnetic field or strain to the fourfold degenerate line nodes. Last, we propose realizations for each species of fermion in known materials, many of which are known to exist in single-crystal form. Fermi arcs from a threefold degeneracy. Shown is the surface density of states as a function of momentum for a crystal in SG 214 with bulk threefold degeneracies that project to (0.25, 0.25) and (–0.25, –0.25). Two Fermi arcs emanate from these points, indicating that their monopole charge is 2. The arcs then merge with the surface projection of bulk states near the origin."

Recent chromosome-conformation-capture studies have revealed topologically associating domains (TADs) as a conserved feature of chromatin organization, but how TADs are spatially organized in individual chromosomes remains unknown. Here, we developed an imaging method for mapping the spatial positions of numerous genomic regions along individual chromosomes and traced the positions of TADs in human interphase autosomes and X chromosomes. We observed that chromosome folding deviates from the ideal fractal-globule model at large length scales and that TADs are largely organized into two compartments spatially arranged in a polarized manner in individual chromosomes. Active and inactive X chromosomes adopt different folding and compartmentalization configurations. These results suggest that the spatial organization of chromatin domains can change in response to regulation."

This warming has contributed to the regional retreat of glaciers, disintegration of floating ice shelves and a 'greening' through the expansion in range of various flora. Several interlinked processes have been suggested as contributing to the warming, including stratospheric ozone depletion, local sea-ice loss, an increase in westerly winds, and changes in the strength and location of low-high-latitude atmospheric teleconnections. Here we use a stacked temperature record to show an absence of regional warming since the late 1990s. The annual mean temperature has decreased at a statistically significant rate, with the most rapid cooling during the Austral summer. Temperatures have decreased as a consequence of a greater frequency of cold, east-to-southeasterly winds, resulting from more cyclonic conditions in the northern Weddell Sea associated with a strengthening mid-latitude jet. These circulation changes have also increased the advection of sea ice towards the east coast of the peninsula, amplifying their effects. Our findings cover only 1% of the Antarctic continent and emphasize that decadal temperature changes in this region are not primarily associated with the drivers of global temperature change but, rather, reflect the extreme natural internal variability of the regional atmospheric circulation."
https://openalex.org/W2481574272,"For over 140 years, lichens have been regarded as a symbiosis between a single fungus, usually an ascomycete, and a photosynthesizing partner. Other fungi have long been known to occur as occasional parasites or endophytes, but the one lichen-one fungus paradigm has seldom been questioned. Here we show that many common lichens are composed of the known ascomycete, the photosynthesizing partner, and, unexpectedly, specific basidiomycete yeasts. These yeasts are embedded in the cortex, and their abundance correlates with previously unexplained variations in phenotype. Basidiomycete lineages maintain close associations with specific lichen species over large geographical distances and have been found on six continents. The structurally important lichen cortex, long treated as a zone of differentiated ascomycete cells, appears to consistently contain two unrelated fungi."
https://openalex.org/W2487288428,"Pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is carried out by the spliceosome, which undergoes an intricate assembly and activation process. Here, we report an atomic structure of an activated spliceosome (known as the B(act) complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, determined by cryo-electron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.52 angstroms. The final refined model contains U2 and U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), nineteen complex (NTC), NTC-related (NTR) protein, and a 71-nucleotide pre-mRNA molecule, which amount to 13,505 amino acids from 38 proteins and a combined molecular mass of about 1.6 megadaltons. The 5' exon is anchored by loop I of U5 snRNA, whereas the 5' splice site (5'SS) and the branch-point sequence (BPS) of the intron are specifically recognized by U6 and U2 snRNA, respectively. Except for coordination of the catalytic metal ions, the RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 are mostly primed for catalysis. The catalytic latency is maintained by the SF3b complex, which encircles the BPS, and the splicing factors Cwc24 and Prp11, which shield the 5' exon-5'SS junction. This structure, together with those determined earlier, outlines a molecular framework for the pre-mRNA splicing reaction."

https://openalex.org/W2505052752,"Each cycle of pre-messenger RNA splicing, carried out by the spliceosome, comprises two sequential transesterification reactions, which result in the removal of an intron and the joining of two exons. Here we report an atomic structure of a catalytic step I spliceosome (known as the C complex) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as determined by cryo-electron microscopy at an average resolution of 3.4 angstroms. In the structure, the 2'-OH of the invariant adenine nucleotide in the branch point sequence (BPS) is covalently joined to the phosphate at the 5' end of the 5' splice site (5'SS), forming an intron lariat. The freed 5' exon remains anchored to loop I of U5 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and the 5'SS and BPS of the intron form duplexes with conserved U6 and U2 snRNA sequences, respectively. Specific placement of these RNA elements at the catalytic cavity of Prp8 is stabilized by 15 protein components, including Snu114 and the splicing factors Cwc21, Cwc22, Cwc25, and Yju2. These features, representing the conformation of the spliceosome after the first-step reaction, predict structural changes that are needed for the execution of the second-step transesterification reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2512829170,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin positive inclusions (FTLD-U) are two clinically distinct neurodegenerative conditions sharing a similar histopathology characterized by the nuclear clearance of TDP-43 and its associated deposition into cytoplasmic inclusions in different areas of the central nervous system. Given the concomitant occurrence of TDP-43 nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic accumulation, it has been proposed that TDP-43 proteinopathies originate from either a loss-of-function (LOF) mechanism, a gain-of-function (GOF) process, or both. We have addressed this issue by transfecting murine NSC34 and N2a cells with siRNA for endogenous murine TDP-43 and with human recombinant TDP-43 inclusion bodies (IBs). These two strategies allowed the depletion of nuclear TDP-43 and the accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 aggregates to occur separately and independently. Endogenous and exogenous TDP-43 were monitored and quantified using both immunofluorescence and Western blotting analysis, and nuclear functional TDP-43 was measured by monitoring the sortilin 1 mRNA splicing activity. Various degrees of TDP-43 cytoplasmic accumulation and nuclear TDP-43 depletion were achieved and the resulting cellular viability was evaluated, leading to a quantitative global analysis on the relative effects of LOF and GOF on the overall cytotoxicity. These were found to be ∼55% and 45%, respectively, in both cell lines and using both readouts of cell toxicity, showing that these two mechanisms are likely to contribute apparently equally to the pathologies of ALS and FTLD-U."
https://openalex.org/W2485301686,"One of the defining properties of electrons is their mutual Coulomb repulsion. However, in solids this basic property may change; for example, in superconductors, the coupling of electrons to lattice vibrations makes the electrons attract one another, leading to the formation of bound pairs. Fifty years ago it was proposed that electrons can be made attractive even when all of the degrees of freedom in the solid are electronic, by exploiting their repulsion from other electrons. This attraction mechanism, termed 'excitonic', promised to achieve stronger and more exotic superconductivity. Yet, despite an extensive search, experimental evidence for excitonic attraction has yet to be found. Here we demonstrate this attraction by constructing, from the bottom up, the fundamental building block of the excitonic mechanism. Our experiments are based on quantum devices made from pristine carbon nanotubes, combined with cryogenic precision manipulation. Using this platform, we demonstrate that two electrons can be made to attract each other using an independent electronic system as the 'glue' that mediates attraction. Owing to its tunability, our system offers insights into the underlying physics, such as the dependence of the emergent attraction on the underlying repulsion, and the origin of the pairing energy. We also demonstrate transport signatures of excitonic pairing. This experimental demonstration of excitonic pairing paves the way for the design of exotic states of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2949307264,"Invertebrates lack the cellular and physiological machinery of the adaptive immune system, but show specificity in their immune response and immune priming. Functionally, immune priming is comparable to immune memory in vertebrates. Individuals that have survived exposure to a given parasite are better protected against subsequent exposures. Protection may be cross-reactive, but demonstrations of persistent and specific protection in invertebrates are increasing. This immune priming can cross generations (""trans-generational"" immune priming), preparing offspring for the prevailing parasite environment. While these phenomena gain increasing support, the mechanistic foundations underlying such immune priming, both within and across generations, remain largely unknown. Using a transcriptomic approach, we show that exposing bumblebee queens with an injection of heat-killed bacteria, known to induce trans-generational immune priming, alters daughter (worker) gene expression. Daughters, even when unexposed themselves, constitutively express a core set of the genes induced upon direct bacterial exposure, including high expression of antimicrobial peptides, a beta-glucan receptor protein implicated in bacterial recognition and the induction of the toll signaling pathway, and slit-3 which is important in honeybee immunity. Maternal exposure results in a distinct upregulation of their daughters' immune system, with a signature overlapping with the induced individual response to a direct exposure. This will mediate mother-offspring protection, but also associated costs related to reconfiguration of constitutive immune expression. Moreover, identification of conserved immune pathways in memory-like responses has important implications for our understanding of the innate immune system, including the innate components in vertebrates, which share many of these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2491378668,"Background and Objective Verticalization was reported to improve the level of arousal and awareness in patients with severe acquired brain injury (ABI) and to be safe in ICU. We evaluated the effectiveness of a very early stepping verticalization protocol on their functional and neurological outcome. Methods Consecutive patients with Vegetative State or Minimally Conscious State were enrolled in ICU on the third day after an ABI. They were randomized to undergo conventional physiotherapy alone or associated to fifteen 30-minute sessions of verticalization, using a tilt table with robotic stepping device. Once stabilized, patients were transferred to our Neurorehabilitation unit for an individualized treatment. Outcome measures (Glasgow Coma Scale, Coma Recovery Scale revised -CRSr-, Disability Rating Scale–DRS- and Levels of Cognitive Functioning) were assessed on the third day from the injury (T0), at ICU discharge (T1) and at Rehab discharge (T2). Between- and within-group comparisons were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively. Results Of the 40 patients enrolled, 31 completed the study without adverse events (15 in the verticalization group and 16 in the conventional physiotherapy). Early verticalization started 12.4±7.3 (mean±SD) days after ABI. The length of stay in ICU was longer for the verticalization group (38.8 ± 15.7 vs 25.1 ± 11.2 days, p = 0.01), while the total length of stay (ICU+Neurorehabilitation) was not significantly different (153.2 ± 59.6 vs 134.0 ± 61.0 days, p = 0.41). All outcome measures significantly improved in both groups after the overall period (T2 vs T0, p<0.001 all), as well as after ICU stay (T1 vs T0, p<0.004 all) and after Neurorehabilitation (T2 vs T1, p<0.004 all). The improvement was significantly better in the experimental group for CRSr (T2-T0 p = 0.033, T1-T0 p = 0.006) and (borderline) for DRS (T2-T0 p = 0.040, T1-T0 p = 0.058). Conclusions A stepping verticalization protocol, started since the acute stages, improves the short-term and long-term functional and neurological outcome of ABI patients.

https://openalex.org/W2496523948,"Background delay in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis (TB) may worsen the disease, increase mortality and enhance transmission in the community. This study aimed at assessing the association between total delay and unfavorable treatment outcome among newly diagnosed pulmonary TB (PTB) patients. Methods A prospective cohort study was conducted in West Gojjam Zone, Amhara Region of Ethiopia from October 2013 to May 2015. Newly diagnosed PTB patients who were ≥15 years of age were consecutively enrolled in the study from 30 randomly selected public health facilities. Total delay (the time period from onset of TB symptoms to first start of anti-TB treatment) was measured. Median total delay was calculated. Mixed effect logistics regression was used to analyze factors associated with unfavorable treatment outcome. Results Seven hundred six patients were enrolled in the study. The median total delay was 60 days. Patients with total delay of > 60 days were more likely to have unfavorable TB treatment outcome than patients with total delay of ≤ 60 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04–5.26). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive TB patients were 8.46 times more likely to experience unfavorable treatment outcome than HIV negative TB patients (AOR, 8.46; 95% CI, 3.14–22.79). Conclusions Long total delay and TB/HIV coinfection were associated with unfavorable treatment outcome. Targeted interventions that can reduce delay in diagnosis and treatment of TB, and early comprehensive management of TB/HIV coinfection are needed to reduce increased risk of unfavorable treatment outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2488298563,"Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients show altered connectivity with the network maintaining ongoing resting brain activity, known as the default mode network (DMN). The connectivity patterns of DMN with the rest of the brain in FMS patients are poorly understood. This study employed seed-based functional connectivity analysis to investigate resting-state functional connectivity with DMN structures in FMS. Sixteen female FMS patients and 15 age-matched, healthy control subjects underwent T2-weighted resting-state MRI scanning and functional connectivity analyses using DMN network seed regions. FMS patients demonstrated alterations to connectivity between DMN structures and anterior midcingulate cortex, right parahippocampal gyrus, left superior parietal lobule and left inferior temporal gyrus. Correlation analysis showed that reduced functional connectivity between the DMN and the right parahippocampal gyrus was associated with longer duration of symptoms in FMS patients, whereas augmented connectivity between the anterior midcingulate and posterior cingulate cortices was associated with tenderness and depression scores. Our findings demonstrate alterations to functional connectivity between DMN regions and a variety of regions which are important for pain, cognitive and emotional processing in FMS patients, and which may contribute to the development or maintenance of chronic symptoms in FMS."

https://openalex.org/W2491794149,"Recent studies have suggested that there are certain pathophysiological relationships between bipolar disorder (BD) and circadian rhythm dysfunction. However, apparently no studies have clarified the prevalence of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (CRSWD) in patients with BD. This study was set out to investigate the prevalence of CRSWD and associated factors in patients with BD. One hundred four euthymic BD outpatients participated in this study. The subjects were asked to answer questionnaires including demographic variables, clinical course of BD, and family history of psychiatric disorders and suicide. Severity of BD was assessed by the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale. CRSWD was diagnosed by clinical interview, together with sleep logs, according to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, third edition (ICSD-3). Thirty-five subjects (32.4%) met the criteria for CRSWD. The age at the time of investigation and that at the onset of BD were both lower in the CRSWD group than in the non-CRSWD group. The rates of family history of psychiatric disorders and suicide in the CRSWD group were higher than those in the non-CRSWD group. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of CRSWD was significantly associated with younger onset age of BD and family history of suicide. The prevalence of CRSWD could be quite high in BD patients. Younger onset age of BD and family history of suicide were associated with presence of CRSWD in BD patients."

PTPRZ has long (PTPRZ-A) and short type (PTPRZ-B) receptor forms by alternative splicing. The extracellular CS moiety of PTPRZ is required for high-affinity binding to inhibitory ligands, such as pleiotrophin (PTN), midkine, and interleukin-34; however, its functional significance in regulating PTPRZ activity remains obscure. We herein found that protein expression of CS-modified PTPRZ-A began earlier, peaking at approximately postnatal days 5–10 (P5–P10), and then that of PTN peaked at P10 at the developmental stage corresponding to myelination onset in the mouse brain. Ptn-deficient mice consistently showed a later onset of the expression of myelin basic protein, a major component of the myelin sheath, than wild-type mice. Upon ligand application, PTPRZ-A/B in cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells exhibited punctate localization on the cell surface instead of diffuse distribution, causing the inactivation of PTPRZ and oligodendrocyte differentiation. The same effect was observed with the removal of CS chains with chondroitinase ABC but not polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of PTPRZ. These results indicate that the negatively charged CS moiety prevents PTPRZ from spontaneously clustering and that the positively charged ligand PTN induces PTPRZ clustering, potentially by neutralizing electrostatic repulsion between CS chains. Taken altogether, these data indicate that PTN-PTPRZ-A signaling controls the timing of oligodendrocyte precursor cell differentiation in vivo, in which the CS moiety of PTPRZ receptors maintains them in a monomeric active state until its ligand binding.

https://openalex.org/W2481536954,"The widespread rimmed grooves, lineations and elongate craters extending from the Imbrium impact basin on the Moon, termed the Imbrium Sculpture, includes a non-radial component that is used to infer that the Imbrium impactor was the size of a proto-planet—about half the diameter of Vesta. The pattern of rimmed grooves, lineations and elongate craters around Mare Imbrium on the Moon has been termed the Imbrium Sculpture. Rather than radiating from the centre of Imbrium, the grooves come from different locations reflecting the consequence of a giant oblique collision. Peter Schultz and David Crawford use the non-radial trends in these patterns to infer that the Imbrium impactor was a proto-planet with a diameter about half that of the asteroid Vesta. On the basis of laboratory impact experiments, shock physics codes and the observed groove widths, the authors conclude that multiple fragments from each oblique basin-forming impactor, such as the one that formed Imbrium, should have survived planetary collisions and contributed to the heavy impact bombardment between 4.3 and 3.8 billion years ago. Rimmed grooves, lineations and elongate craters around Mare Imbrium shape much of the nearside Moon. This pattern was coined the Imbrium Sculpture1, and it was originally argued that it must have been formed by a giant oblique (~30°) impact, a conclusion echoed by later studies2. Some investigators, however, noticed that many elements of the Imbrium Sculpture are not radial to Imbrium, thereby implicating an endogenic or structural origin3,4. Here we use these non-radial trends to conclude that the Imbrium impactor was a proto-planet (half the diameter of Vesta), once part of a population of large proto-planets in the asteroid belt. Such independent constraints on the sizes of the Imbrium and other basin-forming impactors markedly increase estimates for the mass in the asteroid belt before depletion caused by the orbital migration of Jupiter and Saturn5. Moreover, laboratory impact experiments, shock physics codes and the groove widths indicate that multiple fragments (up to 2% of the initial diameter) from each oblique basin-forming impactor, such as the one that formed Imbrium, should have survived planetary collisions and contributed to the heavy impact bombardment between 4.3 and 3.8 billion years ago."

Current study aimed to determine the extent of renal deterioration with diuretic therapy.A total 312 non-dialysis dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) patients were prospectively followed-up for one year. Fluid overload was assessed via bioimpedance spectroscopy. Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated from serum creatinine values by using Chronic Kidney Disease- Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.Out of 312 patients, 64 (20.5%) were hypovolemic while euvolemia and hypervolemia were observed in 113 (36.1%) and 135 (43.4%) patients. Overall 144 patients were using diuretics among which 98 (72.6%) were hypervolemic, 35 (30.9%) euvolemic and 11 (17.2%) were hypovolemic. The mean decline in estimated GFR of entire cohort was -2.5 ± 1.4 ml/min/1.73m2 at the end of follow up. The use of diuretics was significantly associated with decline in eGFR. A total of 36 (11.5%) patients initiated renal replacement therapy (RRT) and need of RRT was more profound among diuretic users.The use of diuretics was associated with adverse renal outcomes indicated by decline in eGFR and increasing risk of RRT initiation in our cohort of NDD-CKD patients.

In spite of their proven efficacy, the development of promising SSO drug candidates has been limited by reported cases of SSO-associated hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms of SSO induced liver toxicity are poorly understood, and up to now no preclinical in vitro model has been established that allows prediction of the hepatotoxicity risk of a given SSO. Therefore, preclinical assessment of hepatic liability currently relies on rodent studies that require large cohorts of animals and lengthy protocols. Here, we describe the establishment and validation of an in vitro assay using primary hepatocytes that recapitulates the hepatotoxic profile of SSOs previously observed in rodents. In vitro cytotoxicity upon unassisted delivery was measured as an increase in extracellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and concomitant reduction in intracellular glutathione and ATP levels after 3 days of treatment. Furthermore, toxic, but not safe, SSOs led to an increase in miR-122 in cell culture supernatants after 2 days of exposure, revealing the potential use of miR122 as a selective translational biomarker for detection of SSO-induced hepatotoxicity. Overall, we have developed and validated for the first time a robust in vitro screening assay for SSO liver safety profiling which allows rapid prioritization of candidate molecules early on in development."

Here we report a platform of chemically programmed biAbs aimed at redirecting cytotoxic T cells to eliminate cancer cells. Two different antibody technologies were merged together to make a novel chemically programmed biAb. This was achieved by combining the humanized anti-hapten monoclonal antibody (mAb) h38C2 with the humanized anti-human CD3 mAb v9 in a clinically investigated diabody format known as Dual-Affinity Re-Targeting (DART). We show that h38C2 × v9 DARTs can readily be equipped with tumor-targeting hapten-derivatized small molecules without causing a systemic response harming healthy tissues. As a proof of concept, we chemically programmed h38C2 × v9 with hapten-folate and demonstrated its selectivity and potency against folate receptor 1 (FOLR1)-expressing ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Unlike conventional biAbs, chemically programmed biAbs in DART format are highly modular with broad utility in terms of both target and effector cell engagement. Most importantly, they provide tumor-targeting compounds access to the power of cancer immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2490854435,"Attenuation of Mycobacterium bovis BCG strain is related to the loss of the RD1-encoded ESX-1 secretion system. The ESX-1 system secretes virulence factor ESAT-6 that plays a critical role in modulation of the host immune system, which is essential for establishment of a productive infection. Previous studies suggest that among the reasons for attenuation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra is a mutation in the phoP gene that interferes with the ESX-1 secretion system and inhibits secretion of ESAT-6. Here, we identify a totally different and distinct regulatory mechanism involving PhoP and transcription regulator EspR on transcriptional control of the espACD operon, which is required for ESX-1-dependent ESAT-6 secretion. Although both of these regulators are capable of influencing espACD expression, we show that activation of espACD requires direct recruitment of both PhoP and EspR at the espACD promoter. The most fundamental insights are derived from the inhibition of EspR binding at the espACD regulatory region of the phoP mutant strain because of PhoP-EspR protein-protein interactions. Based on these results, a model is proposed suggesting how PhoP and EspR protein-protein interactions contribute to activation of espACD expression and, in turn, control ESAT-6 secretion, an essential pathogenic determinant of M. tuberculosis Together, these results have significant implications on the mechanism of virulence regulation of M. tuberculosis."

Furthermore, urine pH was monitored for potential metabolic alkalosis. BP administration significantly reduced melanoma growth in mice; the optimal dose in terms of tolerability and efficacy was 8 g/l (p< 0.05). The in vivo results were supported by in vitro experiments, wherein BP-treated human and murine melanoma cell cultures exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor cell growth. This investigation provides the first proof of concept that systemic buffering can improve tumor control by itself and that this approach may represent a new strategy in prevention and/or treatment of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2487919028,"Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a widespread mechanism of inter-bacterial competition. CDI(+) bacteria deploy large CdiA effector proteins, which carry variable C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CT). CDI(+) cells also produce CdiI immunity proteins that specifically neutralize cognate CdiA-CT toxins to prevent auto-inhibition. Here, we present the crystal structure of the CdiA-CT/CdiI(E479) toxin/immunity protein complex from Burkholderia pseudomallei isolate E479. The CdiA-CT(E479) tRNase domain contains a core α/β-fold that is characteristic of PD(D/E)XK superfamily nucleases. Unexpectedly, the closest structural homolog of CdiA-CT(E479) is another CDI toxin domain from B. pseudomallei 1026b. Although unrelated in sequence, the two B. pseudomallei nuclease domains share similar folds and active-site architectures. By contrast, the CdiI(E479) and CdiI(1026b) immunity proteins share no significant sequence or structural homology. CdiA-CT(E479) and CdiA-CT(1026b) are both tRNases; however, each nuclease cleaves tRNA at a distinct position. We used a molecular docking approach to model each toxin bound to tRNA substrate. The resulting models fit into electron density envelopes generated by small-angle x-ray scattering analysis of catalytically inactive toxin domains bound stably to tRNA. CdiA-CT(E479) is the third CDI toxin found to have structural homology to the PD(D/E)XK superfamily. We propose that CDI systems exploit the inherent sequence variability and active-site plasticity of PD(D/E)XK nucleases to generate toxin diversity. These findings raise the possibility that many other uncharacterized CDI toxins may belong to the PD(D/E)XK superfamily."

The interaction between SLE and pregnancy remains debated. The objective of this study was to analyze the fetal and maternal outcomes of Chinese women with SLE. A total of 109 pregnancies in 83 SLE patients from June 2004 to June 2014 at a tertiary university hospital were reviewed retrospectively. Patients' characteristics, clinical and laboratory data during pregnancy were obtained from electronic medical records. After exclusion of elective abortions, the live birth rate was 61.5%. Significantly, APS (antiphospholipid syndrome), disease activity, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia during pregnancy were more commonly observed in fetal loss pregnancies than in live birth pregnancies. Compared to the 64 women with a history of SLE, 19 women with new-onset lupus during pregnancy had worse pregnancy outcome. Furthermore, the 64 patients with a history of SLE were divided into lupus nephritis group and SLE group (non-renal involvement). We found that the lupus nephritis group had worse maternal outcome than the SLE group. We conclude that new-onset lupus during pregnancy predicts both adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, while a history of lupus nephritis predicts adverse maternal outcomes. It is essential to provide SLE women with progestational counseling and regular multispecialty care during pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W4210604196,"Pore-forming toxins (PFT) are cytolytic proteins belonging to the molecular warfare apparatus of living organisms. The assembly of the functional transmembrane pore requires several intermediate steps ranging from a water-soluble monomeric species to the multimeric ensemble inserted in the cell membrane. The non-lytic oligomeric intermediate known as prepore plays an essential role in the mechanism of insertion of the class of $\beta$-PFT. However, in the class of $\alpha$-PFT like the actinoporins produced by sea anemones, evidence of membrane-bound prepores is still lacking. We have employed single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to identify, for the first time, a prepore species of the actinoporin fragaceatoxin C (FraC) bound to lipid vesicles. The size of the prepore coincides that of the functional pore, except for the transmembrane region, which is absent in the prepore. Biochemical assays indicated that, in the prepore species, the N-terminus is not inserted in the bilayer but exposed to the aqueous solution. Our study reveals the structure of the prepore complex in actinoporins, and highlights the role of structural intermediates for the formation of cytolytic pores by an $\alpha$-PFT."

During infection, EPEC and enterohemorrhagic E. coli remain extracellular and attach intimately to the apical surface of enterocytes, forming attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. A/E lesions are characterized by localized microvillus effacement and the accumulation of host cytoskeletal proteins beneath the adherent bacteria (2Frankel G. Phillips A.D. Attaching effacing Escherichia coli and paradigms of Tir-triggered actin polymerization: getting off the pedestal.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A/E lesion formation requires the EPEC T3SS and secreted effector proteins, which are encoded on a genomic pathogenicity island called the locus of enterocyte effacement. EPEC also delivers a repertoire of non-locus of enterocyte effacement-encoded (Nle) effector proteins into host cells, some of which dampen the inflammatory response during infection and allow EPEC to evade early detection by the host immune system (3Baruch K.

Another EPEC effector, NleE, is a novel S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyltransferase that modifies a cysteine residue in the Npl4 zinc finger (NZF) domain of the host signaling adaptor proteins TAK1-binding proteins 2 and 3 (TAB2 and TAB3) (16Zhang L.

TAB2 and TAB3 are redundant proteins that are essential for signaling via the Toll-like, IL-1, and TNF receptors. Upon activation, the NZF domains of TAB2/3 bind Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on target proteins, such as the receptor-associated ubiquitin ligases TRAF6 and TRAF2. Polyubiquitin chain binding by TAB2/3 allows TAK1 to form a complex with IκB kinase and subsequently phosphorylate IκB kinase β. This leads to the phosphorylation and degradation of IκB and subsequent activation of NF-κB. NleE abolishes the ubiquitin chain binding capacity of the NZF domains of TAB2/3 and thereby disrupts NF-κB signaling (16Zhang L. Ding X. Cui J. Xu H. Chen J. Gong Y.N. Hu L. Zhou Y. Ge J. Lu Q. Liu L. Chen S. Shao F. Cysteine methylation disrupts ubiquitin-chain sensing in NF-κB activation.Nature. 2012; 481: 204-208Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). More recently, the NZF domain-containing protein ZRANB3 was identified as an NleE substrate, and when methylated, the NZF domain of ZRANB3 also lost the ability to bind polyubiquitin chains (19Yao Q. Zhang L. Wan X. Chen J. Hu L. Ding X. Li L. Karar J. Peng H. Chen S. Huang N. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Shao F. Structure and specificity of the bacterial cysteine methyltransferase effector NleE suggests a novel substrate in human DNA repair pathway.PLoS Pathog. 2014; 10: e1004522Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). ZRANB3 has been described previously as a translocase or annealing helicase that interacts with Lys63-linked polyubiquitinated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (19Yao Q. Zhang L. Wan X. Chen J.

Despite the comprehensive work that has defined the novel enzymatic activities of NleE and other T3SS effectors, knowledge of effector target recognition and binding regions is often lacking. Here, we identified a highly conserved motif in the N terminus of NleE that is critical for the recognition of targets in host. We also investigated the propensity of OspZ to bind and methylate NleE host targets as well as the role of OspZ in the inhibition of NF-κB activation and IL8 expression during Shigella flexneri 6 infection. Although the 208IDSYMK214 motif is essential for NleE activity (6Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M. Lucas M. Holloway G. Wagstaff K.M. Dunstone M.A. Sloan J. Whisstock J.C. Kaper J.B.

To test whether the 208IDSYMK214 motif was involved in target recognition, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to investigate binding of NleE to its host target, TAB3. Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 was co-transformed with NleE and TAB3 yeast expression constructs, and protein-protein interactions were assessed by growth of the yeast on selective quadruple dropout medium. Full-length NleE from EPEC E2348/69 interacted with TAB3 as did NleE6A, a derivative of NleE where each amino acid in the 208IDSYMK214 motif was substituted with alanine (Fig. 1A). Hence despite the fact that NleE6A is unable to inhibit NF-κB activation (6Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M. Lucas M. Holloway G. Wagstaff K.M. Dunstone M.A. Sloan J. Whisstock J.C. Kaper J.B. Robins-Browne R.M. Jans D.A. Frankel G.

To narrow down the TAB3-binding region within NleE, we performed a sequential deletion analysis of NleE and determined the capacity of the NleE truncations to bind TAB3 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1, A and B). The results suggested that the N-terminal 53 amino acids of NleE were crucial for the interaction with TAB3 (Fig. 1, A and B). Within this 53-amino acid sequence, amino acids 34–52 are highly conserved among NleE/OspZ proteins from EPEC, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and Shigella (Fig. 2A). Upon transformation of S. cerevisiae AH109 with constructs expressing TAB3 and just the fragment comprising amino acids 34–52 (NleE34–52), growth was observed on quadruple dropout medium, suggesting that amino acids 34–52 within NleE were sufficient to sustain an interaction with TAB3 (Fig. 1, A and B). To further confirm the interaction, purified GST-NleE and GST-NleE34–52 were used to pull down TAB3-FLAG from cell lysates of transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). GST alone showed no interaction with TAB3-FLAG. Based on the observation that the region between amino acids 34 and 52 of NleE was sufficient for binding to TAB3, we tested whether this region was required for inhibition of NF-κB activation by NleE. Using a Dual-Luciferase reporter system to measure NF-κB activation (6Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M. Lucas M. Holloway G. Wagstaff K.M. Dunstone M.A. Sloan J. Whisstock J.C. Kaper J.B.

HeLa cells expressing EGFP alone were used as a positive control for activation. This suggested that the region between amino acids 34 and 52 was essential for the function of NleE. We predicted that amino acids 34–52 would overlap the T3SS secretion and translocation signal, making analysis of this region of NleE difficult in EPEC. To test this, we used a system that utilizes translational fusions to TEM1 β-lactamase (20Charpentier X. Oswald E. Identification of the secretion and translocation domain of the enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli effector Cif, using TEM-1 β-lactamase as a new fluorescence-based reporter.J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5486-5495Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Equivalent expression of the TEM1-fused NleE derivatives in EPEC E2348/69 was detected with β-lactamase antibodies (data not shown). Not surprisingly, a derivative of NleE lacking amino acids 34–52 was not translocated into host cells (Fig. 3A). To narrow down the TAB3-binding domain of NleE further, we screened three NleE deletion mutants, NleEΔ41–52, NleEΔ45–52, and NleEΔ49–52, for their ability to bind TAB3. None of the NleE mutants tested bound to TAB3 in the yeast two-hybrid system, suggesting that the region between amino acids 49 and 52 was important for NleE-TAB3 interactions (Fig. 3B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments in cultured epithelial cells confirmed this observation as full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NleE immunoprecipitated with TAB3-FLAG, whereas no binding was observed between TAB3-FLAG and a derivative of NleE where each of 49GITR52 was replaced with alanine (GFP-NleE49AAAA52) (Fig. 3C). Despite equivalent expression (data not shown), none of the NleE deletion mutants (NleEΔ41–52, NleEΔ45–52, and NleEΔ49–52) were able to inhibit NF-κB activation as efficiently as full-length NleE (Fig. 3D), further suggesting that the 49GITR52 region was important for NleE function. HeLa cells expressing EGFP alone were used as a positive control for activation. We then tested the ability of EPEC to translocate NleEΔ49–52 and observed that NleEΔ49–52-TEM1 was translocated into cells (Fig. 3A), making analysis of the 49GITR52 region possible in the EPEC background. Because EPEC has been reported to inhibit IκB degradation (21Ruchaud-Sparagano M.H. Maresca M. Kenny B.

As observed previously, cells infected with an EPEC nleE deletion mutant or the PP4/IE6 double island deletion mutant, which lacks seven effector genes (6Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M.

In contrast, reintroduction of nleEΔ49–52 to these mutant backgrounds was unable to restore the inhibition of IκB degradation in response to TNF (Fig. 4A) or the inhibition of IL-8 secretion during EPEC infection (Fig. 4B). Similarly, exchange of each of 49GITR52 in NleE with alanine (NleE49AAAA52) generated a non-functional derivative of NleE, similar to NleEΔ49–52 (Fig. 4C). Given that NleE disrupts NF-κB signaling by transferring a methyl group onto the conserved zinc-coordinating cysteine located in the NZF domain of TAB2 and TAB3 (16Zhang L. Ding X. Cui J. Xu H. Chen J. Gong Y.N. Hu L. Zhou Y. Ge J. Lu Q. Liu L. Chen S. Shao F. Cysteine methylation disrupts ubiquitin-chain sensing in NF-κB activation.Nature. 2012; 481: 204-208Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the 49GITR52 motif was important for target methylation by NleE. TAB3-FLAG was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of transfected HEK293T cells and then incubated with either purified wild type GST-NleE or GST-NleE49AAAA52 together with [3H]AdoMet. [3H]AdoMet labeling of full-length TAB3 was detected by 3H autoradiography. Wild type NleE effectively catalyzed the transfer of [3H]methyl from [3H]AdoMet onto TAB3, whereas NleE49AAAA52 failed to mediate TAB3 cysteine methylation (Fig. 4D). This was presumably due to the requirement of the 49GITR52 motif for NleE substrate recognition and interaction with TAB3, although influence of the mutation on other aspects of enzyme activity cannot be ruled out. We reasoned that if NleE34–52 bound TAB3 then a fragment of this region alone would act as a competitive inhibitor for native NleE. HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-NleE34–52 were utilized to determine whether expression of the NleE TAB3-binding fragment diminished the efficacy of full-length NleE during infection. Suppression of IL-8 production by EPEC was used as a measure of native NleE activity. HeLa cells or HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-NleE34–52 (Fig. 5, A and B) were infected with wild type EPEC E2348/69, an nleE deletion mutant, ΔnleE complemented with full-length nleE, the PP4/IE6 double island mutant, or ΔPP4/IE6 complemented with full-length nleE. As observed previously, wild type EPEC inhibited IL-8 secretion in HeLa cells stimulated with TNF, whereas infection of HeLa cells with ΔnleE or ΔPP4/IE6 induced a significant increase in IL-8 production in both stimulated and unstimulated cells (Fig. 5C) (6Newton H.J. Pearson J.S. Badea L. Kelly M. Lucas M. Holloway G. Wagstaff K.M. Dunstone M.A. Sloan J. Whisstock J.C. Kaper J.B. Robins-Browne R.M. Jans D.A. Frankel G.

In HeLa cells stably expressing GFP-NleE34–52, IL-8 secretion was significantly increased during wild type EPEC infection compared with HeLa cells alone. Similarly, GFP-NleE34–52-expressing cells infected with ΔnleE or ΔPP4/IE6 and complemented with full-length nleE showed significantly higher IL-8 levels than HeLa cells alone (Fig. 5C). Overall, this suggested that the NleE34–52 fragment could block the activity of full-length NleE during infection. To determine whether the 49GITR52 motif of NleE was also needed for the interaction of NleE with TAB2 and ZRANB3, we performed FLAG immunoprecipitation on HEK293T cells co-expressing GFP-NleE derivatives and TAB2-FLAG or ZRANB3-FLAG. GFP-NleE co-immunoprecipitated with TAB2-FLAG and ZRANB3-FLAG, whereas no interaction was observed between GFP-NleE49AAAA52 and TAB2-FLAG or ZRANB3-FLAG (Fig. 6, A and B). We next investigated whether the 49GITR52 motif of NleE was important for TAB2 and ZRANB3 cysteine methylation. TAB2-FLAG or ZRANB3-FLAG were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates of transfected HEK293T cells, respectively, and then incubated with either purified wild type GST-NleE or GST-NleE49AAAA52 together with [3H]AdoMet. [3H]AdoMet labeling of full-length TAB2 or ZRANB3 was detected by 3H autoradiography. Wild type NleE effectively catalyzed the transfer of [3H]methyl from [3H]AdoMet to TAB2 and ZRANB3, whereas NleE49AAAA52 failed to induce the methylation of TAB2 and ZRANB3 (Fig. 6, C and D). Given that the amino acid sequences of OspZ from S. flexneri and EPEC NleE show a high degree of similarity, we investigated whether OspZ targets the same host proteins as NleE. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we observed an interaction between OspZ and TAB3 (Fig. 7A). OspZ also showed an ability to methylate TAB3, and this required the 49GITR52 motif (Fig. 7B). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using HEK293T cells expressing GFP-OspZ confirmed the interaction between OspZ and TAB3 and showed that OspZ also interacted with TAB2 and ZRANB3 (Fig. 7, C, D, and E). Similar to NleE, binding of OspZ to TAB2, TAB3, and ZRANB3 required the 49GITR52 motif because GFP-OspZ49AAAA52 did not co-purify with any of TAB3-FLAG, TAB2-FLAG, or ZRANB3-FLAG (Fig. 7, C, D, and E). However, we could not detect methylation of TAB2 and ZRANB3 by OspZ (data not shown). To confirm whether OspZ from S. flexneri 6 could inhibit NF-κB activation, we generated a GFP-OspZ fusion to compare with GFP-NleE. Expression of the GFP fusions was confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP antibodies (data not shown). HeLa cells expressing GFP-NleE or GFP-OspZ were left unstimulated or stimulated with TNF for 2 h. NleE from EPEC E2348/69 and full-length OspZ from S. flexneri 6 inhibited NF-κB activation in response to TNF, although the inhibitory effect of OspZ appeared weaker than that of NleE. Mutation of the 49GITR52 motif to generate GFP-OspZ49AAAA52 abolished the ability of OspZ to block NF-κB activation, similar to NleE. This suggested that the 49GITR52 substrate-binding motif was essential for the full function of NleE and OspZ (Fig. 8A). Given that OspZ inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation, we determined whether OspZ affected the expression of NF-κB-regulated genes during Shigella infection. To address this, we generated an ospZ mutant of S. flexneri 6 where ospZ was replaced with a kanamycin cassette by allelic exchange using the λ Red recombinase system. We then compared IL8 transcription levels in HT-29 cells infected with wild type S. flexneri 6, the ospZ deletion mutant, or ospZ mutant complemented with full-length ospZ. Cell monolayers were infected for 1 h, and IL8 mRNA levels were examined by quantitative PCR. IL8 expression was significantly higher in cells infected with the ospZ deletion mutant compared with those infected with wild type S. flexneri 6 and the ospZ mutant complemented with full-length ospZ (Fig. 8B). HT-29 cells were also utilized to determine whether the 49GITR52 motif was important for OspZ-mediated inhibition of IL-8 production during S. flexneri 6 infection. Following infection for 2 h, the ospZ mutant strain showed a diminished ability to inhibit IL-8 production compared with wild type S. flexneri 6, and this effect was restored upon complementation with a copy of wild type ospZ but not with ospZ49AAAA52 (Fig. 8C). Overall, OspZ showed a similar ability to inhibit IL-8 production during infection, and the 49GITR52 motif was important for this function. A number of EPEC T3SS effectors have been implicated in the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production during EPEC infection (1Wong A.R. Pearson J.S. Bright M.D. Munera D. Robinson K.S. Lee S.F.

Of these, NleE is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB activation through its recognition and modification of the adaptor proteins TAB2 and TAB3 (16Zhang L. Ding X. Cui J. Xu H. Chen J. Gong Y.N. Hu L.

https://openalex.org/W2494770251,"Atherosclerosis, caused in part by monocytes in plaques, continues to be a disease that afflicts the modern world. Whilst significant steps have been made in treating this chronic inflammatory disease, questions remain on how to prevent monocyte and macrophage accumulation in atherosclerotic plaques. Junctional Adhesion Molecule C (JAM-C) expressed by vascular endothelium directs monocyte transendothelial migration in a unidirectional manner leading to increased inflammation. Here we show that interfering with JAM-C allows reverse-transendothelial migration of monocyte-derived cells, opening the way back out of the inflamed environment. To study the role of JAM-C in plaque regression we used a mouse model of atherosclerosis, and tested the impact of vascular JAM-C expression levels on monocyte reverse transendothelial migration using human cells. Studies in-vitro under inflammatory conditions revealed that overexpression or gene silencing of JAM-C in human endothelium exposed to flow resulted in higher rates of monocyte reverse-transendothelial migration, similar to antibody blockade. We then transplanted atherosclerotic, plaque-containing aortic arches from hyperlipidemic ApoE-/- mice into wild-type normolipidemic recipient mice. JAM-C blockade in the recipients induced greater emigration of monocyte-derived cells and further diminished the size of atherosclerotic plaques. Our findings have shown that JAM-C forms a one-way vascular barrier for leukocyte transendothelial migration only when present at homeostatic copy numbers. We have also shown that blocking JAM-C can reduce the number of atherogenic monocytes/macrophages in plaques by emigration, providing a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory pathologies."

However, longitudinal research on this topic is lacking. Moreover, it remains unclear whether subjects with psychotic experiences are also at risk of displaying psychological violence. The present study aims to investigate these associations.The longitudinal association between baseline psychotic experiences and six-year incidence of violence perpetration and three-year incidence of arrest was studied in a prospective cohort of 6646 general population adults. Logistic regression analyses with varying levels of adjustment were performed in the complete sample and in subsamples stratified by presence or absence of baseline mental disorders.The presence of psychotic experiences at baseline increased the risk of physical violence, psychological violence and arrest at follow-up. However, adjustment for dimensional measures of psychopathology and contextual confounders reduced all associations considerably. After adjustment, both clinically validated (OR = 3.59, 95% CI 1.09-11.81) and self-reported hallucinations (OR = 2.83, 95% CI 1.05 7.65) remained significantly associated with physical violence perpetration. Self-reported (OR = 3.06, 95% CI 1.55-6.03) and clinically validated delusions (OR = 3.24, 95% CI 1.47-7.13) were associated with an increased risk of arrest. There was no significant association between psychotic experiences and incident psychological violence in the fully adjusted model.Specific psychotic experiences may differentially predict physical violence perpetration and arrest, even after adjustment for demographics, dimensional measures of psychopathology and contextual confounders. However, more longitudinal research with larger sample sizes is required to confirm these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2492064668,"Rugose projections on the anterior and posterior aspects of vertebral neural spines appear throughout Amniota and result from the mineralization of the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments via metaplasia, the process of permanent tissue-type transformation. In mammals, this metaplasia is generally pathological or stress induced, but is a normal part of development in some clades of birds. Such structures, though phylogenetically sporadic, appear throughout the fossil record of non-avian theropod dinosaurs, yet their physiological and adaptive significance has remained unexamined. Here we show novel histologic and phylogenetic evidence that neural spine projections were a physiological response to biomechanical stress in large-bodied theropod species. Metaplastic projections also appear to vary between immature and mature individuals of the same species, with immature animals either lacking them or exhibiting smaller projections, supporting the hypothesis that these structures develop through ontogeny as a result of increasing bending stress subjected to the spinal column. Metaplastic mineralization of spinal ligaments would likely affect the flexibility of the spinal column, increasing passive support for body weight. A stiff spinal column would also provide biomechanical support for the primary hip flexors and, therefore, may have played a role in locomotor efficiency and mobility in large-bodied species. This new association of interspinal ligament metaplasia in Theropoda with large body size contributes additional insight to our understanding of the diverse biomechanical coping mechanisms developed throughout Dinosauria, and stresses the significance of phylogenetic methods when testing for biological trends, evolutionary or not."

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is crucial to allow appropriate and timely treatment. Current laboratory stool testing has a long turnaround time (TAT) and demands highly qualified personnel and multiple techniques. The need for high throughput and the number of possible enteric pathogens compels the implementation of a molecular approach which uses multiplex technology, without compromising performance requirements. In this work we evaluated the feasibility of the NanoCHIP® Gastrointestinal Panel (GIP) (Savyon Diagnostics, Ashdod, IL), a molecular microarray-based screening test, to be used in the routine workflow of our laboratory, a big outpatient microbiology laboratory. The NanoCHIP® GIP test provides simultaneous detection of nine major enteric bacteria and parasites: Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Giardia sp., Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar, Dientamoeba fragilis, and Blastocystis spp. The required high-throughput was obtained by the NanoCHIP® detection system together with the MagNA Pure 96 DNA purification system (Roche Diagnostics Ltd., Switzerland). This combined system has demonstrated a higher sensitivity and detection yield compared to the conventional methods in both, retrospective and prospective samples. The identification of multiple parasites and bacteria in a single test also enabled increased efficiency of detecting mixed infections, as well as reduced hands-on time and work load. In conclusion, the combination of these two automated systems is a proper response to the laboratory needs in terms of improving laboratory workflow, turn-around-time, minimizing human errors and can be efficiently integrated in the routine work of the laboratory."

TrkA is ubiquitinated, among other E3 ubiquitin ligases, by Nedd4-2. To understand mechanistically how TrkA ubiquitination is regulated, we performed a siRNA screening to identify deubiquitinating enzymes and found that USP36 acts as an important regulator of TrkA activation kinetics and ubiquitination. However, USP36 action on TrkA was indirect because it does not deubiquitinate TrkA. Instead, USP36 binds to Nedd4-2 and regulates the association of TrkA and Nedd4-2. In addition, depletion of USP36 increases TrkA·Nedd4-2 complex formation, whereas USP36 expression disrupts the complex, resulting in an enhancement or impairment of Nedd4-2-dependent TrkA ubiquitination, respectively. Moreover, USP36 depletion leads to enhanced total and surface TrkA expression that results in increased NGF-mediated TrkA activation and signaling that augments PC12 cell differentiation. USP36 actions extend beyond TrkA because the presence of USP36 interferes with Nedd4-2-dependent Kv7.2/3 channel regulation.

https://openalex.org/W2485736969,"The adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells is a promising approach for the treatment of chronic viral and malignant diseases. In order to improve adoptive T cell therapy (ATT) of cancer, recent strategies aim at the antibody-based blockade of immunosuppressive signaling pathways in CD8+ T cells. Alternatively, adjuvant effects of immunostimulatory cytokines might be exploited to improve therapeutic CD8+ T cell responses. For example, Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a potent growth, activation and survival factor for CD8+ T cells that can be used to improve virus- and tumor-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Although direct IL-7 effects on CD8+ T cells were studied extensively in numerous models, the contribution of IL-7 receptor-competent (IL-7R+) host cells remained unclear. In the current study we provide evidence that CD8+ T cell-mediated tumor rejection in response to recombinant IL-7 (rIL-7) therapy is strictly dependent on IL-7R+ host cells. On the contrary, CD8+ T cell expansion is independent of host IL-7R expression. If, however, rIL-7 therapy and peptide vaccination are combined, host IL-7R signaling is crucial for CD8+ T cell expansion. Unexpectedly, maximum CD8+ T cell expansion relies mainly on IL-7R signaling in non-hematopoietic host cells, similar to the massive accumulation of dendritic cells and granulocytes. In summary, we provide evidence that IL-7R+ host cells are major targets of rIL-7 that modulate therapeutic CD8+ T cell responses and the outcome of rIL-7-assisted ATT. This knowledge may have important implications for the design and optimization of clinical ATT protocols."
https://openalex.org/W2494691366,"Maspin (SerpinB5) is a non-inhibitory serpin (serine protease inhibitor) with very diverse biological activities including regulation of cell adhesion, migration, death, control of gene expression and oxidative stress response. Initially described as a tumor and metastasis suppressor, clinical data brought controversies to the field, as some studies reported no correlation between SerpinB5 expression and prognosis value. These data underscore the importance of understanding SerpinB5 function in a normal physiological context and the molecular mechanism involved. Several SerpinB5 phosphoforms have been detected in different cell lines, but the signaling pathways involved and the biological significance of this post-translational modification in vivo remains to be explored. In this study we investigated SerpinB5 expression, subcellular localization and phosphorylation in different stages of the mouse mammary gland development and the signaling pathway involved. Here we show that SerpinB5 is first detected in late pregnancy, reaches its highest levels in lactation and remains at constant levels during post-lactational regression (involution). Using high resolution isoelectric focusing followed but immunoblot, we found at least 8 different phosphoforms of SerpinB5 during lactation, which decreases steadily at the onset of involution. In order to investigate the signaling pathway involved in SerpinB5 phosphorylation, we took advantage of the non-transformed MCF-10A model system, as we have previously observed SerpinB5 phosphorylation in these cells. We detected basal levels of SerpinB5 phosphorylation in serum- and growth factor-starved cells, which is due to amphiregulin autocrine activity on MCF-10A cells. EGF and TGF alpha, two other EGFR ligands, promote important SerpinB5 phosphorylation. Interestingly, EGF treatment is followed by SerpinB5 nuclear accumulation. Altogether, these data indicate that SerpinB5 expression and phosphorylation are developmentally regulated. In vitro analyses indicate that SerpinB5 phosphorylation is regulated by EGFR ligands, but EGF appears to be the only able to induce SerpinB5 nuclear localization."
https://openalex.org/W2499078761,"We evaluated the impact of shoreline dynamics on fringing vegetation density at mid- and low-marsh elevations at a high-energy site in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Particularly, we selected eight unprotected shoreline stretches (75 m each) at a historically eroding site and measured their inter-annual lateral movement rate using the DSAS method for three consecutive years. We observed high inter-annual variability of shoreline movement within the selected stretches. Specifically, shorelines retrograded (eroded) in year 1 and year 3, whereas, in year 2, shorelines advanced seaward. Despite shoreline advancement in year 2, an overall net erosion was recorded during the survey period. Additionally, vegetation density generally declined at both elevations during the survey period; however, probably due to their immediate proximity with lateral erosion agents (e.g., waves, currents), marsh grasses at low-elevation exhibited abrupt reduction in density, more so than grasses at mid elevation. Finally, contrary to our hypothesis, despite shoreline advancement, vegetation density did not increase correspondingly in year 2 probably due to a lag in response from biota. More studies in other coastal systems may advance our knowledge of marsh edge systems; however, we consider our results could be beneficial to resource managers in preparing protection plans for coastal wetlands against chronic stressors such as lateral erosion."
https://openalex.org/W2496498747,"The mechanisms of action by which cyclophilin inhibitors (CypI) interfere with the HCV life cycle remain poorly understood. We reported that CypI and NS5A inhibitors (NS5Ai), but not other classes of anti-HCV agents, prevent assembly of double membrane vesicles (DMVs), which protect replication complexes. We demonstrated that both NS5A and the isomerase cyclophilin A (CypA) are required for DMV formation. Here, we examined whether CypI mediate an additional antiviral effect that could further explain the high efficacy of CypI. We identified a unique action of CypI. CypI remodel the organization of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of HCV-infected cells, but not of uninfected cells. This effect is specific since it was not observed for other classes of anti-HCV agents including NS5Ai, and has no effect on the viability of CypI-treated cells. Since ER serves as platform for the establishment of HCV replication complexes, we asked whether the ER reorganization by CypI would prevent cells from being newly infected. Remarkably, CypI-treated HCV-pre-infected cells remain totally impervious to a reinfection, suggesting that the CypI-mediated ER reorganization prevents a reinfection. This block is not due to residual CypI since CypI-resistant HCV variants also fail to infect these cells. The ER reorganization by CypI is rapid and reversible. This study provides the first evidence that CypI trigger a unique ER reorganization of infected cells, rendering cells transiently impervious to a reinfection. This study further suggests that the HCV-induced ER rearrangement represents a key target for the development of new therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2498068144,"The Philippine Islands are one of the most biologically diverse archipelagoes in the world. Current taxonomy, however, may underestimate levels of avian diversity and endemism in these islands. Although species limits can be difficult to determine among allopatric populations, quantitative methods for comparing phenotypic and genotypic data can provide useful metrics of divergence among populations and identify those that merit consideration for elevation to full species status. Using a conceptual approach that integrates genetic and phenotypic data, we compared populations among 48 species, estimating genetic divergence (p-distance) using the mtDNA marker ND2 and comparing plumage and morphometrics of museum study skins. Using conservative speciation thresholds, pairwise comparisons of genetic and phenotypic divergence suggested possible species-level divergences in more than half of the species studied (25 out of 48). In speciation process space, divergence routes were heterogeneous among taxa. Nearly all populations that surpassed high genotypic divergence thresholds were Passeriformes, and non-Passeriformes populations surpassed high phenotypic divergence thresholds more commonly than expected by chance. Overall, there was an apparent logarithmic increase in phenotypic divergence with respect to genetic divergence, suggesting the possibility that divergence among these lineages may initially be driven by divergent selection in this allopatric system. Also, genetic endemism was high among sampled islands. Higher taxonomy affected divergence in genotype and phenotype. Although broader lineage, genetic, phenotypic, and numeric sampling is needed to further explore heterogeneity among divergence processes and to accurately assess species-level diversity in these taxa, our results support the need for substantial taxonomic revisions among Philippine birds. The conservation implications are profound."
https://openalex.org/W2505668485,"Reporter genes are powerful technologies that can be used to directly inform on the fate of transplanted cells in living subjects. Imaging reporter genes are often employed to quantify cell number, location(s), and viability with various imaging modalities. To complement this, reporters that are secreted from cells can provide a low-cost, in vitro diagnostic test to monitor overall cell viability at relatively high frequency without knowing the locations of all cells. Whereas protein-based secretable reporters have been developed, an RNA-based reporter detectable with amplification inherent PCR-based assays has not been previously described. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs (18–22 nt) that regulate mRNA translation and are being explored as relatively stable blood-based disease biomarkers. We developed an artificial miRNA-based secreted reporter, called Sec-miR, utilizing a coding sequence that is not expressed endogenously and does not have any known vertebrate target. Sec-miR was detectable in both the cells and culture media of transiently transfected cells. Cells stably expressing Sec-miR also reliably secreted it into the culture media. Mice implanted with parental HeLa cells or HeLa cells expressing both Sec-miR and the bioluminescence imaging (BLI) reporter gene Firefly luciferase (FLuc) were monitored over time for tumor volume, FLuc signal via BLI, and blood levels of Sec-miR. Significantly (p<0.05) higher Sec-miR was found in the blood of mice bearing Sec-miR-expressing tumors compared to parental cell tumors at 21 and 28 days after implantation. Importantly, blood Sec-miR reporter levels after day 21 showed a trend towards correlation with tumor volume (R2 = 0.6090; p = 0.0671) and significantly correlated with FLuc signal (R2 = 0.7067; p<0.05). Finally, we could significantly (p<0.01) amplify Sec-miR secretion into the cell media by chaining together multiple Sec-miR copies (4 instead of 1 or 2) within an expression cassette. Overall, we show that a novel complement of BLI together with a unique Sec-miR reporter adds an in vitro RNA-based diagnostic to enhance the monitoring of transplanted cells. While Sec-miR was not as sensitive as BLI for monitoring cell number, it may be more sensitive than clinically-relevant positron emission tomography (PET) reporter assays. Future work will focus on improving cell detectability via improved secretion of Sec-miR reporters from cells and more sensitive detection platforms, as well as, exploring other miRNA sequences to allow multiplexed monitoring of more than one cell population at a time. Continued development may lead to more refined and precise monitoring of cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2506141464,"Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an important infectious disease in Hebei Province. At present, cases from the northeast regions of the province account for >80% of the total incidences. However, studies that examine the region-specific genetic variations of the Hantavirus (HV), the causative pathogen for HFRS, have been lacking.Rodents were collected in northeast Hebei Province from 2004 to 2013, and the HV strains used in this study were isolated in 1993. Lung tissues were isolated from the rodents and HV antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescence. The M1 and M2 fragments of HV M region were amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), cloned into pMDl9-T vector, sequenced and compared with representative standard stains for homology and phylogenetic analysis.A total of 21 samples of HV antigen-positive were collected. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the 19 rodent lungs and two HV strains were positive for the SEO virus. 11 samples were chosen to sequence, and they shared 95.8%-99.8% in nucleotide homology, and 83.6%-99.2% when compared to the standard strains of SEO virus. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all strains were grouped into the same S3 subtype.SEO was the major epidemic genotype of HV in the main HFRS endemic areas in Hebei Province, and S3 was the major subtype. There was minor genetic variation in HV over short term periods, while long term variations were higher."
https://openalex.org/W2504743972,We test the competition enhancing effect of selling forward in experimental Cournot duopoly and quadropoly with multiple forward markets. We find that two forward periods yields competitive outcomes and that the results are very close to the predicted theoretical results for quantity setting duopolies and quadropolies. Our experiments lend strong support to the hypothesis that forward markets are competition enhancing. We then test a new market that allows for endogenously determined indefinitely many forward periods that only close when sellers coordinate on selling a zero amount in a forward market. We find that the outcomes under an endogenous close rule are also very competitive. These results hold for both duopolies and quadropolies.
https://openalex.org/W2480906217,"Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) is a widely abundant, multifunctional protein most highly expressed in post-mitotic neurons. Mutations causing Rett syndrome and related neurodevelopmental disorders have been identified along the entire MECP2 locus, but symptoms vary depending on mutation type and location. C-terminal mutations are prevalent, but little is known about the function of the MeCP2 C-terminus. We employ the genetic efficiency of Drosophila to provide evidence that expression of p.Arg294* (more commonly identified as R294X), a human MECP2 E2 mutant allele causing truncation of the C-terminal domains, promotes apoptosis of identified neurons in vivo. We confirm this novel finding in HEK293T cells and then use Drosophila to map the region critical for neuronal apoptosis to a small sequence at the end of the C-terminal domain. In vitro studies in mammalian systems previously indicated a role of the MeCP2 E2 isoform in apoptosis, which is facilitated by phosphorylation at serine 80 (S80) and decreased by interactions with the forkhead protein FoxG1. We confirm the roles of S80 phosphorylation and forkhead domain transcription factors in affecting MeCP2-induced apoptosis in Drosophila in vivo, thus indicating mechanistic conservation between flies and mammalian cells. Our findings are consistent with a model in which C- and N-terminal interactions are required for healthy function of MeCP2."
https://openalex.org/W2489741633,"Microstimulation of brain tissue plays a key role in a variety of sensory prosthetics, clinical therapies and research applications, however the effects of stimulation parameters on the responses they evoke remain widely unknown. In particular, the effects of parameters when delivered in the form of a stimulus train as opposed to a single pulse are not well understood despite the prevalence of stimulus train use. We aimed to investigate the contribution of each parameter of a stimulus train to the duration of the motor responses they evoke in forelimb muscles. We used constant-current, biphasic, square wave pulse trains in acute terminal experiments under ketamine anaesthesia. Stimulation parameters were systematically tested in a pair-wise fashion in the caudal forelimb region of the motor cortex in 7 Sprague-Dawley rats while motor evoked potential (MEP) recordings from the forelimb were used to quantify the influence of each parameter in the train. Stimulus amplitude and train duration were shown to be the dominant parameters responsible for increasing the total duration of the MEP, while interphase interval had no effect. Increasing stimulus frequency from 100–200 Hz or pulse duration from 0.18–0.34 ms were also effective methods of extending response durations. Response duration was strongly correlated with peak time and amplitude. Our findings suggest that motor cortex intracortical microstimulations are often conducted at a higher frequency rate and longer train duration than necessary to evoke maximal response duration. We demonstrated that the temporal properties of the evoked response can be both predicted by certain response metrics and modulated via alterations to the stimulation signal parameters."

This study provides molecular evidence for the modulation of iron bioavailability by ribosomal dysfunction as a potent etiological factor of non-mutagenic environmental hemochromatosis in the gut-to-blood axis. Iron is an essential element required for all living organisms and an abundant transition metal. In addition, iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis of erythrocytes to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body (1Outten F.W. Theil E.C. Iron-based redox switches in biology.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 1029-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Iron plays important roles in cell proliferation, and iron deficiency results in cell growth arrest, DNA damage, and cell apoptosis. Accurate regulation of iron intake, storage, and export is necessary for cellular iron homeostasis, and intracellular distribution is tightly managed by various endogenous regulators. Increased iron deficiency or decreased iron overload results in enhanced dietary iron absorption via the intestinal epithelium. In mammals, iron homeostasis is controlled at the level of iron uptake rather than excretion, making iron absorption across the intestinal epithelial cell a key control point for iron homeostasis (2Andrews N.C. Disorders of iron metabolism.N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 341: 1986-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Most dietary iron absorption occurs in the duodenum (3Davies P.S. Enns C.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 25085-25092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, disruptions in iron homeostasis result in a variety of diseases of iron overload (hemochromatosis). The most important causes of this state are hereditary hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder, and transfusional iron overload from repeated blood transfusions (4Griffiths W.J. Mayr R. McFarlane I. Hermann M. Halsall D.J. Zoller H. Cox T.M. Clinical presentation and molecular pathophysiology of autosomal dominant hemochromatosis caused by a novel ferroportin mutation.Hepatology. 2010; 51: 788-795PubMed Google Scholar). The major form of dietary non-heme iron transported into the gastrointestinal tract is ferrous iron (Fe2+). Ferric iron (Fe3+) must be converted to Fe2+ prior to absorption via various enzymes, including ferric reductase (5Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith Jr., J.C.

Absorptive enterocytes also take up iron-containing heme from the diet. Although the mechanisms of heme transportation into enterocytes are less well understood, some candidates, including heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1), a membrane protein, are known to mediate iron-containing heme uptake into enterocytes, whereas free iron is released from the heme by heme oxygenase (HO) (8Shayeghi M.

Iron transferred into enterocytes is stored as ferritin or exported across the basolateral membrane. The intracellular iron in the enterocytes, which is an important source of plasma iron, is also transported to other tissues or organs, including the liver, bone marrow, and spleen, for iron storage or use (9De Domenico I.

For export of intracellular iron from enterocytes to blood vessels, a sole known transporter, ferroportin (FPN), which is expressed in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes, membrane of macrophages, and sinusoidal surfaces of hepatocytes, plays crucial roles in the efflux of iron to other tissues or cells (12Abboud S.

FPN is encoded by two tissue-specific spliced transcripts, FPN1A and FPN1B, that produce the same protein. However, FPN transcripts differ in the presence or absence of 5′ iron-responsive elements (IREs), which leads to translational repression of FPN synthesis when iron is lacking. In particular, FPN1B is mainly expressed in enterocytes and erythroid precursors, which are able to export intracellular iron when iron deficiency occurs (17Zhang D.L. Hughes R.M. Ollivierre-Wilson H. Ghosh M.C. Rouault T.A.

Patients with genetic mutations in the FPN gene develop hemochromatosis. There are two types of hereditary FPN diseases: macrophage-type and hepatic-type diseases. Loss-of-function mutations in FPN genes causes iron trapping in macrophages, high transferrin saturation, and hepatocellular iron overload (4Griffiths W.J. Mayr R. McFarlane I. Hermann M.

A number of these xenobiotics can irreversibly cleave 28S ribosomal RNA at a single phosphodiester bond within a universally conserved sequence known as the sarcin-ricin loop (23Iordanov M.S.

In this study, ribosomal inactivation-insulted human enterocytes showed altered levels of intercellular iron accumulation. Iron transfer across the basolateral membrane of the enterocyte into circulation is the rate-limiting step in iron absorption, but any discordance in iron transfer from enterocytes to the circulation would lead to excessive iron accumulation and subsequent mucosal injuries (5Han O. Failla M.L. Hill A.D. Morris E.R. Smith Jr., J.C. Reduction of Fe(III) is required for uptake of nonheme iron by Caco-2 cells.J.

Based on the assumption that iron transfer in the intestine is the main site of iron incorporation from dietary sources and that this can impact mucosal injuries, we investigated the effects of intestinal ribosomal inactivation on rate-limiting iron transport at enterocytes. This investigation provides new insights into iron regulation in the intestinal barrier and iron metabolism-associated disorders, including hemochromatosis in the gastrointestinal tract. Enterocytes, specifically duodenal villus cells, play crucial roles in managing iron homeostasis by regulating iron absorption from the diet. Under the assumption that enterocytes insulted by ribosomal inactivation altered iron absorption, we investigated the effects of ribosomal inactivation on intracellular iron levels in human enterocyte cells using HT-29 cells, which have more duodenal characteristics than other intestinal cell lines (3Davies P.S. Enns C.A. Expression of the hereditary hemochromatosis protein HFE increases ferritin levels by inhibiting iron export in HT29 cells.J. Biol.

To investigate the effects of ribosomal stress on iron transport in cells, we measured the intracellular iron levels by Prussian blue staining following ribotoxic stress induced by DON as a representative chemical ribosomal inactivator. 48 h and 72 h after DON exposure, cellular iron accumulation was increased in HT-29 human enterocytes (Fig. 1A). Among the iron transporters, FPN-1 protein, an iron-exporting transporter, was decreased by ribosome-inactivating DON in time- and dose-dependent manners (Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, FPN-1 mRNA expression was also significantly suppressed in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D and E), demonstrating that transcription was reduced in response to ribosomal inactivation, which occurs earlier than translational arrest, the well known intrinsic action of ribosomal inactivation. From the following experiments, chemical-induced ribosomal inactivation was achieved by treating cells with DON (500–1000 ng/ml). Similarly, other chemical ribosomal inactivators, including anisomycin (ANS), 15-acetyl DON (15AcDON), nivalenol (Niv), and T-2 toxin also enhanced intracellular iron accumulation in human enterocytes (Fig. 1F). Mechanistically, these ribotoxic chemical insults suppressed FPN-1 protein and mRNA expression in the same manner as DON (Fig. 1, G and H). In contrast with FPN-1, DMT-1 expression, a major iron-importing transporter, was not altered by ribosomal stress in human enterocytes (data not shown). As other major iron-absorbing cells, monocytes and hepatocytes were also assessed for the effects of ribosomal inactivation on iron accumulation. Differentiated U937 human monocytes (Fig. 2A) and Huh7 human hepatocytes (Fig. 2C) also showed intracellular iron accumulation in response to ribosomal inactivation in the same manner as human enterocytes. Ribosomal inactivation suppressed FPN-1 protein expression in both monocytes and hepatocytes (Fig. 2, B and D). Moreover, exposure to chemical ribosomal inactivation during the undifferentiated state also suppressed FPN-1 expression in human monocytes (Fig. 2E). Taken together, ribosomal stress induced intercellular iron accumulation in human enterocytes, monocytes (undifferentiated and differentiated), and hepatocytes by suppressing expression of the iron-exporting transporter FPN-1. Ribosomal inactivation stimulates intracellular sentinel signaling pathways that are linked to the activation of cellular stress kinases, including MAPKs, which modulate the expression of genes crucial for homeostasis as well as genes integral to a variety of pathogenic processes (26Shifrin V.I.

We evaluated the involvement of MAPK signals in FPN-1 expression in human IECs. When cells were pretreated with each inhibitor of three major MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK1/2, and p38 MAPK), p38 MAPK inhibition dramatically restored FPN-1 protein and mRNA expression that had been suppressed by ribosomal inactivation (Fig. 3, A and B). p38 phosphorylation was transiently induced by ribosomal inactivation in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3, C and D). In addition to protein and mRNA analysis, p38 inhibition also restored DON-suppressed FPN-1 gene expression, visualized in human enterocytes using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that p38 MAPK is positively involved in FPN-1 suppression in ribosomal inactivation-insulted intestinal epithelial cells. Among the known transcription factors in FPN-1 transcription, nuclear factor erythroid 2-like (NRF2) binds to antioxidant response elements (AREs)/Maf recognition elements (MAREs) with small Maf protein (sMAF) within the FPN-1 promoter (-7007/-7016) (18Harada N.

NF-κB is also an important pro-inflammatory transcription factor within the FPN-1 promoter to induce FPN-1 expression (Fig. 4A) (41Persichini T. Maio N. di Patti M.C. Rizzo G. Toscano S. Colasanti M.

Ribosomal inactivation inhibited ARE transcription activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). Functionally, NRF2, as a crucial mediator of ARE-involved antioxidant responses, counteracted oxidative stress- or ribosomal inactivation-induced cell growth suppression in human IECs (Fig. 4C). Moreover, total and nuclear levels of NRF2 decreased in response to the ribosomal inactivator DON in enterocytes (Fig. 4, D and E). Other ribosomal inactivators also decreased the nuclear amount of NRF2 (Fig. 4F) and thus suppressed the ARE-linked transcription activity (Fig. 4G). Because FPN-1 expression is regulated by ribosomal stress-activated p38 MAPK, we attempted to address the relationship between p38 activation and FPN-1-modulating NRF2 expression in ribosomal inactivation-insulted cells. Ribosomal inactivation suppressed both cytosolic and nucleic NRF2 expression, which were retarded in p38 MAPK-inhibited cells, indicating p38 MAPK-dependent NRF2 suppression (Fig. 5A). Confocal microscopy revealed that ribosomal inactivation-reduced nucleic NRF2 expression was significantly retarded by inhibiting p38 MAPK signals (Fig. 5B). To confirm that NRF2 is a key transcription factor for FPN-1 expression in ribosomal stress-exposed enterocytes, we checked the effects of NRF2 overexpression on FPN-1 expression in enterocytes under the stress of ribosomal inactivation. First, NRF2 overexpression enhanced ARE-linked transcriptional activity, whereas ribosomal inactivation suppressed the reporter activity (Fig. 5C). Moreover, ribosomal inactivation-repressed FPN-1 transcription activity using the human FPN-1 promoter-linked reporter plasmid was also enhanced in NRF2-overexpressed human IECs (Fig. 5D). Because enhanced NRF2 as a crucial transcription factor can promote FPN-1 transcription, NRF2 overexpression restored FPN-1 protein expression that had been suppressed by ribosomal inactivation in human enterocytes (Fig. 5E). We also investigated another p38-regulating transcription factor, NF-κB, because the κB binding site is also located in the FPN-1 promoter. A previous study reported that ribosomal"
