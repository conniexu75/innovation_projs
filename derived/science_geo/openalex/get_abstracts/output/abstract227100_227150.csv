The loss of scales and hairs renders identification of a mosquito of this group impossible by means of conventional characters. There is good circumstantial evidence, however, that all these specimens were either Aedes communis De Geer, or an as yet undescribed species indistinguishable from it on any single morphological character in the larval or adult stage1."

Vanselow and Datta2 and Hewitt3 later showed the need of molybdenum by plants with adequate ammonium and nitrate nitrogen. Hewitt, however, has stated3 that the absolute need for molybdenum for normal development when higher plants are supplied with ammonium nitrogen only still remains to be shown, and that the experimental difficulties of the use of ammonium compounds alone limit progress. Incorporation of solid calcium carbonate into ammonium nitrogen cultures, however, has been shown greatly to reduce the injury due to ammonium4,5. This device has been successfully applied to molybdenum-deficiency cultures using a purified source of calcium carbonate."
