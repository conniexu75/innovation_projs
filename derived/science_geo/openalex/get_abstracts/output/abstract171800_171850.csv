https://openalex.org/W2048197073,"It is difficult to mix solutions in microchannels. Under typical operating conditions, flows in these channels are laminar-the spontaneous fluctuations of velocity that tend to homogenize fluids in turbulent flows are absent, and molecular diffusion across the channels is slow. We present a passive method for mixing streams of steady pressure-driven flows in microchannels at low Reynolds number. Using this method, the length of the channel required for mixing grows only logarithmically with the Péclet number, and hydrodynamic dispersion along the channel is reduced relative to that in a simple, smooth channel. This method uses bas-relief structures on the floor of the channel that are easily fabricated with commonly used methods of planar lithography."
https://openalex.org/W2016479629,"It has been long debated whether averaged electrical responses recorded from the scalp result from stimulus-evoked brain events or stimulus-induced changes in ongoing brain dynamics. In a human visual selective attention task, we show that nontarget event-related potentials were mainly generated by partial stimulus-induced phase resetting of multiple electroencephalographic processes. Independent component analysis applied to the single-trial data identified at least eight classes of contributing components, including those producing central and lateral posterior alpha, left and right mu, and frontal midline theta rhythms. Scalp topographies of these components were consistent with their generation in compact cortical domains."
https://openalex.org/W2140167371,"We report on the epitaxial growth of a group-IV ferromagnetic semiconductor, Mn x Ge 1− x , in which the Curie temperature is found to increase linearly with manganese (Mn) concentration from 25 to 116 kelvin. The p -type semiconducting character and hole-mediated exchange permit control of ferromagnetic order through application of a ±0.5-volt gate voltage, a value compatible with present microelectronic technology. Total-energy calculations within density-functional theory show that the magnetically ordered phase arises from a long-range ferromagnetic interaction that dominates a short-range antiferromagnetic interaction. Calculated spin interactions and percolation theory predict transition temperatures larger than measured, consistent with the observed suppression of magnetically active Mn atoms and hole concentration."
https://openalex.org/W2083891358,"Relaxin is a hormone important for the growth and remodeling of reproductive and other tissues during pregnancy. Although binding sites for relaxin are widely distributed, the nature of its receptor has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate that two orphan heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8, are capable of mediating the action of relaxin through an adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent pathway distinct from that of the structurally related insulin and insulin-like growth factor family ligand. Treatment of antepartum mice with the soluble ligand-binding region of LGR7 caused parturition delay. The wide and divergent distribution of the two relaxin receptors implicates their roles in reproductive, brain, renal, cardiovascular, and other functions."
https://openalex.org/W1969154371,"The epilepsies are a common, clinically heterogeneous group of disorders defined by recurrent unprovoked seizures. Here we describe identification of the causative gene in autosomal-dominant partial epilepsy with auditory features (ADPEAF, MIM 600512), a rare form of idiopathic lateral temporal lobe epilepsy characterized by partial seizures with auditory disturbances. We constructed a complete, 4.2-Mb physical map across the genetically implicated disease-gene region, identified 28 putative genes (Fig. 1) and resequenced all or part of 21 genes before identifying presumptive mutations in one copy of the leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 gene (LGI1) in each of five families with ADPEAF. Previous studies have indicated that loss of both copies of LGI1 promotes glial tumor progression. We show that the expression pattern of mouse Lgi1 is predominantly neuronal and is consistent with the anatomic regions involved in temporal lobe epilepsy. Discovery of LGI1 as a cause of ADPEAF suggests new avenues for research on pathogenic mechanisms of idiopathic epilepsies."
https://openalex.org/W2008034134,"The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila subverts vesicle traffic in eukaryotic host cells to create a vacuole that supports replication. The dot/icm genes encode a protein secretion apparatus that L. pneumophila require for biogenesis of this vacuole. Here we show that L. pneumophila produce a protein called RalF that functions as an exchange factor for the ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family of guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). The RalF protein is required for the localization of ARF on phagosomes containing L. pneumophila . Translocation of RalF protein through the phagosomal membrane is a dot/icm -dependent process. Thus, RalF is a substrate of the Dot/Icm secretion apparatus."
https://openalex.org/W2084196175,"We show that 85% of variation in total organic carbon can be explained by mineral surface area in a black shale deposit from two locations in the late Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway, United States. This relation suggests that, as in modern marine sediments, adsorption of carbon compounds onto clay mineral surfaces played a fundamental role in the burial and preservation of organic carbon. Our data also provide evidence for organic matter within the smectite interlayer. This association implies that organic carbon sequestration in a representative oil-prone black shale facies may be more closely related to patterns of continental weathering and clay mineralogy than to ocean water chemistry or marine productivity."

The list of genetically modified plant technologies in trials, including rice, wheat, potatoes, and peanuts, is impressive and differs from those being worked on in other countries. Poor farmers in China are cultivating more area of genetically modified plants than are small farmers in any other developing country. A survey of agricultural producers in China demonstrates that Bacillus thuringiensis cotton adoption increases production efficiency and improves farmer health."
https://openalex.org/W1543811358,"It is known that nanocrystallites can form in shear bands produced during severe bending or high-energy ball milling of thin ribbons of a metallic glass. We present direct experimental evidence that highly confined and controlled local contact at the ultrafine scale in the form of quasi-static nanoindentation of a bulk glassy metal alloy at room temperature can also cause nanocrystallization. Atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy show that nanocrystallites nucleate in and around shear bands produced near indents and that they are the same as crystallites formed during annealing without deformation at 783 kelvin. Analogous to results from recent experiments with glassy polymers, our results are reasoned to be a consequence of flow dilatation inside the bands and of the attendant, radically enhanced, atomic diffusional mobility inside actively deforming shear bands."

https://openalex.org/W2028928303,"We have partially purified a human activity that restores mismatch-dependent, bi-directional excision to a human nuclear extract fraction depleted for one or more mismatch repair excision activities. Human EXOI co-purifies with the excision activity, and the purified activity can be replaced by near homogeneous recombinant hEXOI. Despite the reported 5′ to 3′ hydrolytic polarity of this activity, hEXOI participates in mismatch-provoked excision directed by a strand break located either 5′ or 3′ to the mispair. When the strand break that directs repair is located 3′ to the mispair, hEXOI- and mismatch-dependent gap formation in excision-depleted extracts requires both hMutSα and hMutLα. However, excision directed by a 5′ strand break requires hMutSα but can occur in absence of hMutLα. In systems comprised of pure components, the 5′ to 3′ hydrolytic activity of hEXOI is activated by hMutSα in a mismatch-dependent manner. These observations indicate a hydrolytic function for hEXOI in 5′-heteroduplex correction. The involvement of hEXOI in 3′-heteroduplex repair suggests that it has a regulatory/structural role in assembly of the 3′-excision complex or that the protein possesses a cryptic 3′ to 5′ hydrolytic activity.

Inactivation of genes that encode the mammalian MutS homologs MSH2 or MSH6 or the MutL homologs MLH1 or PMS2 confers genetic instability and a predisposition to tumor development.

Repair is initiated via mismatch recognition by hMutSα (the hMSH2·hMSH6 heterodimer) (13.Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P.

In yeast, deficiency of the 5′ to 3′ exonuclease EXOI (27.Szankasi P. Smith G.R. J. Biol.

The enhancement of mutability by exoI null defects is modest as compared with that observed upon MSH2 inactivation, but this could be due to redundant exonuclease involvement as in the bacterial reaction (29.Tishkoff D.X.

(31.Amin N.S. Nguyen M.N. Oh S. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell.

Since all of these activities have been implicated in mismatch repair (1.Kolodner R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1433-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 2.Modrich P. Lahue R. Ann. Rev.

Yeast EXOI has also been shown to interact physically with yMSH2 and yMLH1 (29.Tishkoff D.X. Boerger A.L. Bertrand P. Filosi N. Gaida G.M. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Analysis of dinucleotide repeat instability in yeast suggested that the RAD27 5′ to 3′ exonuclease might also participate in mismatch repair (37.Johnson R.E. Kovvali G.K. Prakash L. Prakash S. Science. 1995; 269: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar); however, more recent studies indicate that the contribution, if any, of this activity to mismatch rectification is limited (38.Tishkoff D.X.

Petes T.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Yeast genetic studies have also led to the suggestion that the 3′ to 5′ editing exonucleases of DNA polymerases δ and ε may participate in the excision step of mismatch repair (40.Tran H.T. Gordenin D.A. Resnick M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2000-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), but this conclusion has also been questioned based on the finding that the mutator phenotype of the pol3–01 mutant used in this study is largely due to a checkpoint defect rather than mismatch repair deficiency (41.Datta A. Schmeits J.L. Amin N.S. Lau P.J. Myung K. Kolodner R.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 593-603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To further clarify the nature of the excision activities involved in the mammalian reaction, we have developed an in vitro assay for mismatch-provoked excision. Utilizing this method we have demonstrated that hEXOI is required for mismatch repair directed by a strand break located either 3′ or 5′ to the mispair, that in vitro excision directed a 3′ or 5′ strand signals differ in their requirement for hMutLα, and that 5′ to 3′ hydrolysis by hEXOI is activated in a mismatch- and hMutSα-dependent manner in a pure system. Cell lines HeLa S3, H6 (a subclone of HCT116), and MT1 were grown, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (9.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Insect cells (SF9, Invitrogen) were cultured, infected with baculovirus constructs expressing hMutLα subunits or hEXOI, and processed for protein purification as described (43.Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). HeLa S3 nuclear extracts (9.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) were concentrated by precipitation with 420 g/liter ammonium sulfate, dialyzed against buffer A (0.025 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma, relative to a saturated stock in isopropanol), 1 μg/ml leupeptin (Peptides International), 0.5 μg/ml E-64 (Peptides International), 0.1 μg/ml aprotinin (USB)) containing 100 mm KCl and 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Protein was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as standard or by absorbance at 280 nm. For preparation of excision-depleted extracts, MT1 (MSH6−/−) and H6 (MLH1−/−) nuclear extracts (about 200 mg of protein) were adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to 225 mm KCl by the addition of 3 m KCl and loaded onto 10 ml of P-11 phosphocellulose (Whatman) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.225 m KCl and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with 30 ml of starting buffer, and fractions containing protein that passed through the column were pooled. After a wash with 50 ml of buffer A containing 0.375 m KCl and 1 mm DTT, the column was step-eluted with buffer A containing 1 m KCl and 1 mm DTT. Protein-containing fractions passing through the column in 0.225 m KCl were combined with those eluting in the 0.375–1 m KCl step. This material, which is depleted of mismatch-provoked excision activity, was concentrated, dialyzed, and stored as described above for HeLa nuclear extract. In addition to removal of excision activity, this depletion procedure also results in partial removal of hMutSα and hMutLα. To ensure that these required activities were not limiting, depleted extract fractions were supplemented with near homogeneous hMutLα or hMutSα prior to use. Thus, excision-depleted extract from MSH6−/− MT1 cells was supplemented with hMutLα (0.78 μg/mg extract protein), and the supplemented extract is referred to below as excision-depleted MSH6−/− extract. Excision-depleted extract from MLH1−/− H6 cells was supplemented with hMutSα (3.1 μg/mg) in a similar manner. hMutSα was purified to homogeneity from HeLa cells by a minor modification of the previously described method (13.Drummond J.T. Li G.-M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Recombinant hMutLα was purified to homogeneity from a cleared supernatant prepared from insect cells infected with baculovirus constructs that express hMLH1 and hPMS2 (43.Blackwell L.J. Wang S.

Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1950-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). To remove insect excision activities, the phosphocellulose eluate was passed over single-stranded DNA-cellulose in 0.20 m KCl prior to loading onto hydroxyapatite. Recombinant hEXOIa and hEXOIb were isolated from SF9 cells infected with baculovirus-expressing constructs, which were prepared using the pFASTBAC system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. hEXOI cDNA (EST843301, Ref. 33.Tishkoff D.X.

Amin N.S. Viars C.S. Arden K.C. Kolodner R.D. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5027-5031PubMed Google Scholar). Insect cells were infected with baculovirus expressing hEXOIa or hEXOIb, and cleared supernatants were prepared as described previously (43.Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For hEXOIa preparation, cleared supernatant (150 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 2-ml Heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B (0.02 m KPO4, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.19m KCl. After a wash with 20 ml of starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0.19–0.415 mKCl in buffer B. hEXOIa containing fractions, which eluted about 0.3m KCl, were supplemented with 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitors to the levels noted above for buffer A. This solution was diluted 2-fold with buffer A containing 10% (v/v) glycerol and loaded onto a 1-ml MonoS column (HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.19 mKCl. This column was washed and developed using the same protocol as for the Heparin column. hEXOIa fractions, which eluted about 0.4m KCl, were pooled, supplemented with 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitors as described above, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. hEXOIb was purified by the same method except that the insect cell-cleared lysate (about 300 mg of protein) was first loaded onto a 15-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.15m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors as noted above. After washing with 75 ml of starting buffer, the column was eluted with a gradient from 0.15–0.40 m KCl in buffer B containing 1 mm DTT and supplemented with protease inhibitors as above. hEXOIb-containing fractions, which eluted at 0.27m KCl, were pooled, diluted 2-fold with buffer A containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, and subjected to fractionation on Heparin HiTrap and MonoS columns as described above. hEXOIb eluted at ∼0.3m KCl on both of the latter columns. Final purities of hEXOIa and hEXOIb obtained in this manner were ∼95% (Fig. 4). 1160 mg of HeLa nuclear extract was thawed on ice and adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to 0.20 m KCl with buffer B containing 0.40 m KCl and 1 mm DTT and supplemented with protease inhibitors as above (Fraction I). Fraction I was loaded onto a 90-ml phosphocellulose P-11 column equilibrated with protease inhibitor-supplemented buffer B containing 0.20 mKCl and 1 mm DTT. After a wash with 360 ml of starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 10-step KCl gradient (0.22–0.40m, 10-ml, and 0.02 m KCl increase per step). Fractions were collected and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. phosphocellulose chromatography was repeated on a second batch of nuclear extract (1160 mg), and fractions restoring gap formation from the two preparations, which eluted about 0.33 KCl, were thawed on ice and pooled (Fraction II). Fraction II was dialyzed against 2 liters of protease inhibitor-supplemented buffer B containing 0.175 m KCl and 2 mm DTT until the conductivity was equivalent to 0.20 m KCl and loaded onto a 10-ml single-stranded DNA-cellulose column equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.20 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors at 2 column volumes per hour. After a wash with 100 ml of starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 10-step KCl gradient (0.22–0.40 m, 1-ml, and 0.02 m KCl increase per step). Fractions containing excision activity, which eluted about 0.33 m KCl, were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen (Fraction III). Fraction III was thawed, dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer B supplemented with protease inhibitors and containing 0.075m KCl and 2 mm DTT until the conductivity was equivalent to 0.10 m KCl, and then loaded onto a 1-ml MonoQ FPLC column (HR 5/5, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer B containing 0.10 m KCl. After a wash with 20 ml of starting buffer, the column was eluted with a 14-ml gradient of KCl (0.10–0.50m KCl). Active fractions, which eluted about 0.26m KCl, were pooled and supplemented with protease inhibitors as above, aliquoted, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C (Fraction IV).

P-Cell, phosphocellulose. In vitro mismatch repair assays were performed as described previously (9.Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) except that reaction volume was increased to 20 μl, salt concentration was adjusted to 0.1 m KCl, and incubation was for 15 min at 37 °C. Assay of mismatch-dependent gap formation was performed in the same manner except that dNTPs were omitted and incubation was reduced to 5 min. Reactions contained 100 ng (23 fmol) of a bacteriophage f1-derived G-T or /CA\insertion/deletion heteroduplex (Fig. 1 and Ref. 21.Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an otherwise identical A·T homoduplex, and as indicated, 64 μg of excision-depleted MSH6−/− or MLH1−/− extract, 200 ng of hMutSα, 50 ng of hMutLα, and purified excision activity or recombinant hEXOI. DNA recovered from gap formation reactions was digested with 2 units each of NheI and Bsp106I, and restriction products were resolved by electrophoresis through 1% agarose gels, which were stained with ethidium bromide. DNA was quantitated by ethidium fluorescence using a cooled, photometric grade CCD imager (Photometrics). As summarized in Fig. 1, gap formation activity is defined as the amount of substrate linearized by Bsp106I but resistant to cleavage by NheI. Mapping of excision tract end points was performed by indirect end-labeling as described (21.Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that results were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Rabbits were immunized with multiple antigen peptide conjugated peptides, and sera were obtained using methods described before (17.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised against hEXOI-derived peptide 1 (TLPSKKEVERSRRERRQANL, amino acids 81–100) and peptide 2 (RASGLSKKPASIQKRKHHNA, amino acids 762–781). The resulting antibodies recognize both hEXOIa and hEXOIb and are referred to as AB-1 and AB-2, respectively. Antibodies raised against peptide 3, which is only present in hEXOIb (KKPLSPVRDNIQLTPEAEED, residues 811–830), are referred to as AB-3. Preimmune and specific IgG fractions were obtained by purification on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Specific IgGs were further purified on affinity supports prepared by cross-linking individual peptide antigens to Reacti-Gel 6X (Pierce). For the cross-linking, 25 mg of peptide was incubated with 1 ml of activated resin in 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 10, for 24 h at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by incubation with 1m ethanolamine, pH 10, for 24 h. After extensive wash, peptide columns were loaded with the protein A-purified IgG and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The columns were washed extensively and then eluted with 0.05 m glycine, pH 2.5, and 0.15m NaCl. Fractions were immediately neutralized with 0.1 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, pooled, dialyzed against 0.025 m Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m KCl, aliquoted, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. AB-1, AB-2, and AB-3 used in the work described below were all affinity-purified in this manner. Gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were performed as described previously (17.Genschel J. Littman S.J. Drummond J.T. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19895-19901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). For immunodepletion, 20 μg of AB-2 was bound to 2 μl of protein A-Sepharose suspension and incubated with HeLa nuclear extract (0.45 mg) in a total volume of 15 μl on ice for 4 h. The resin was then removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was used directly in gap formation or mismatch repair assay. In mock depletion experiments, AB-2 was replaced with preimmune IgG obtained from the same rabbit. Previous assays for mismatch-provoked excision are time-consuming (20.Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B. Liskay R.M. Kunkel T.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 65-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 21.Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and unsuitable as a routine assay for isolation of the required excision components. To circumvent this problem we developed a rapid method that relies on the observation that excision tracts produced on an incised heteroduplex extend from the strand break to 90–170 nucleotides beyond the mispair (21.Fang W.-H. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11838-11844Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When repair DNA synthesis is blocked, excision renders an NheI site just beyond the mispair single-stranded and hence resistant to endonuclease cleavage. As shown in Fig. 1, gap formation scored by this NheI-resistant assay depends on the presence of a mismatch within the nicked, circular substrate. Fractionation of HeLa nuclear extract indicated that one or more activities involved in the excision step of mismatch repair elute from phosphocellulose between 0.23 and 0.38 m KCl. This observation was exploited to prepare a crude fraction that was depleted of excision activity for use as receptor extract for isolation of excision activity by in vitro complementation (see “Experimental Procedures”). To avoid artifacts during fractionation, receptor extracts were prepared from mismatch-repair deficient MSH6−/− MT1 cells (hMutSα-deficient) or MLH1−/− H6 cells (hMutLα-deficient), and gap formation was scored as bona fide only if it required depleted extract, hMutSα (or hMutLα), and the partially purified fraction in question. Since the fractionation method for depletion of excision activity also results in partial removal of hMu"

Proteins containing a UCS (UNC-45/CRO1/She4p) domain are necessary for the incorporation of myosin into the contractile ring during cytokinesis and into thick filaments during muscle development. We report that the carboxyl-terminal regions of UNC-45 bound and exerted chaperone activity on the myosin head. The amino-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain of UNC-45 bound the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Thus, UNC-45 functions both as a molecular chaperone and as an Hsp90 co-chaperone for myosin, which can explain previous findings of altered assembly and decreased accumulation of myosin in UNC-45 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans."

https://openalex.org/W2042109420,"An unusual spin excitation mode observed by neutron scattering has inspired numerous theoretical studies of the interplay between charged quasiparticles and collective spin excitations in the copper oxide high-temperature superconductors. The mode has, thus far, only been observed in materials with crystal structures consisting of copper oxide bilayers, and it is absent in the single-layer compound La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4+delta). Neutron-scattering data now show that the mode is present in Tl(2)Ba(2)CuO(6+delta), a single-layer compound with a superconducting transition temperature of approximately 90 kelvin, demonstrating that it is a generic feature of the copper oxide superconductors, independent of the layer sequence. This restricts the theoretical models for the origin of the resonant mode and its role in the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity."
https://openalex.org/W1971729688,"The intramembranous γ-secretase cleavage of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) is dependent on biologically active presenilins (PS). Notch also undergoes a similar PS-dependent γ-secretase-like cleavage, resulting in the liberation of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), which is critically required for developmental signal transduction. γ-Secretase processing of APP results in the production of a similar fragment called AICD (APPintracellular domain), which may function in nuclear signaling as well. AICD, like NICD, is rapidly removed. By using a battery of protease inhibitors we demonstrate that AICD, in contrast to NICD, is degraded by a cytoplasmic metalloprotease. In vitro degradation of AICD can be reconstituted with cytoplasmic fractions obtained from neuronal and non-neuronal cells. Taking into account the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization, we identified three candidate enzymes (neurolysin, thimet oligopeptidase, and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), also known as insulysin), which all are involved in the degradation of bioactive peptides in the brain. When insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, was added to the in vitro degradation assay, removal of AICD was efficiently blocked. Moreover, overexpression of IDE resulted in enhanced degradation of AICD, whereas overexpression of the inactive IDE E111Q mutant did not affect AICD degradation. Finally, immunodepletion of IDE significantly reduced the AICD degrading activity. Therefore our data demonstrate that IDE, which is one of the proteases implicated in the removal of extracellular Aβ, also removes the cytoplasmic product of γ-secretase cleaved APP.

Two sequential cleavages, first by β-secretase and then followed by γ-secretase, are required to liberate Aβ (for review, see Refs. 2.Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S.

PSs are not only involved in proteolytic processing of APP but also in a similar intramembraneous cut of Notch (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Notch, like APP, is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes very similar endoproteolytic processing pathways (for review, see Refs. 2.Esler W.P. Wolfe M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 1449-1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar and 3.Walter J. Kaether C. Steiner H. Haass C. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). After ectodomain shedding, Notch is cleaved within or close to its transmembrane domain by the γ-secretase-like S3 protease activity. The S3 cut finally liberates the Notchintracellular domain (NICD), a key molecule in developmental signal transduction (7.Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Cleavage of Notch at S3 is PS-dependent and can be blocked by γ-secretase inhibitors (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role of PSs in Notch signaling, the PS1/PS2 double knockout in mice has a phenotype similar to that of Notch1−/− mice (8.Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and Notch cleavage is completely inhibited in PS-deficient cells (9.Herreman A. Serneels L.

The requirement of PSs in both NICD formation and γ-secretase cleavage of APP provided the basis for the hypothesis that the γ-secretase-generated cytoplasmic domain of APP may also carry out an important function in nuclear signaling.

AICD is generated by a PS-dependent mechanism, since a PS1 gene knockout as well as a “dominant negative” PS1 mutation (D385N) inhibited AICD generation (13.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Moreover, γ-secretase inhibitors, including ones that are known to bind to PSs, also blocked AICD generation in vivo and in vitro (12.Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C.

Interestingly, the N terminus of AICD is predominantly generated by a cut between amino acids 49 and 50 of the β-amyloid domain and not by the expected γ-secretase cut after amino acids 40 or 42 (13–15). This cleavage releases in vivo a 50-amino acid-long AICD fragment into the cytoplasm but not the predicted 57- or 59-amino acid fragment. Sequence comparison revealed that this cleavage occurs at a very similar position as the S3 cleavage of Notch (13.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C.

Taken together, these analogies between APP and Notch processing may favor the idea that AICD, like NICD, has a physiological function in nuclear signal transduction. Indeed, recent findings with highly sensitive reporter gene assays supported the hypothesis that AICD may be involved in gene transcription (16.Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). However, AICD alone was not sufficient to allow the detection of a significant transcriptional activity in the reporter gene assays. Only upon co-transfection of Fe65, a nuclear adaptor protein that has been shown to bind to the APP cytoplasmic tail (17.Borg J.P. Ooi J. Levy E. Margolis B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6229-6241Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 18.Fiore F. Zambrano N. Minopoli G. Donini V. Duilio A. Russo T. J. Biol.

Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). This may be related to the observation that the recombinant 59-amino acid AICD-like molecules are stabilized by the co-expression of Fe65 (20.Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

In the case of NICD, a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway prevents NICD accumulation and constitutive signaling (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K.

AICD is also rapidly degraded but apparently by a protease activity different from the proteasome (12.Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L.

Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We therefore searched for the protease activity involved in AICD degradation. Surprisingly, we found that AICD can be efficiently degraded by insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a thiol-dependent metalloprotease known to degrade insulin, glucagon, and other peptide hormones (24.Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, IDE is also implicated in the clearance of extracellular Aβ (for review, see Ref.25.Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 177-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Our data therefore suggest that therapeutic stimulation of IDE activity to remove Aβ will also affect AICD metabolism and its potential function in nuclear signal transduction. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 200 μg/ml G418 (to select for APP expression), and 200 μg/ml zeocin (to select for IDE expression). HEK293 cells stably expressing rat IDE variants were generated by transfection of HEK293 cells stably expressing APP695 containing the Swedish mutation (swAPP) (26.Citron M. Oltersdorf T. Haass C. McConlogue L. Hung A.Y. Seubert P. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Lieberburg I. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 672-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells stably expressing swAPP were cultured as described previously (27.Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol.

Protease inhibitors were used at the following final concentrations in the in vitro assays for AICD degradation: protease inhibitor mix with or without EDTA (1× Complete, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), DAPT (1 μm, gift from Boehringer Ingelheim KG), EDTA (5 mm, Sigma), 1,10-o-phenanthroline (PNT, 5 mm, Sigma), phosphoramidon (100 μm,Calbiochem), bestatin (200 μm, Calbiochem),clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (10 μm, Sigma), MG132 (50 μm, Calbiochem), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM, 0.1–10 mm, Sigma), dynorphin A-(1–13) (0.5 mm, Bachem), Pro-Ile (5 mm, Bachem), cFP-AAY-pAB (cFP, 100 μm, gift from Ian Smith), insulin (2–250 μg/ml, Sigma), zincov (100 μm, Calbiochem), E64 (50 μm, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm, Sigma), leupeptin (1 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), aprotinin (2 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), antipain (50 μg/ml, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and pepstatin (2 μg/ml, Calbiochem). A rat IDE cDNA (gift from R. Roth) was cloned into pcDNA3.1/zeo(+) (Invitrogen). The nonfunctional IDE E111Q mutant was generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis using appropriate primers. The polyclonal antibody 6687 to the 20 C-terminal amino acids of APP (5.Steiner H. Kostka M. Romig H. Basset G. Pesold B. Hardy J. Capell A. Meyn L. Grim M.G. Baumeister R. Fechteler K. Haass C. Nat.

A. 1986; 83: 4147-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) have been described. Antibody 9B12 also recognizes rat IDE. To characterize the protease activity involved in AICD degradation we used a previously established in vitro assay (13.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were resuspended (0.5 ml/10-cm dish) in ice-cold hypotonic homogenization buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, without protease inhibitors) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Following homogenization on ice with a tight fitting homogenizer (30 strokes) a post-nuclear supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Crude membranes were isolated from the post-nuclear supernatant by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 40 min at 4 °C. The membranes were then resuspended (50 μl/10-cm dish) in assay buffer (150 mm sodium citrate, pH 6.4, supplemented with the indicated protease inhibitors), and AICD was generated by incubation of samples at 37 °C for 2 h in a volume of 25 μl/assay. After termination of the assay reactions on ice, samples were separated into pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100) fractions by ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The S100 fraction was separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris-Tricine gels (Invitrogen) or 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels (29.Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar) and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibody 6687 and detection using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). Crude membranes prepared as above were resuspended (0.5 ml/10-cm dish) in 100 mmNa2CO3, pH 11.0 (30.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) and incubated on ice for 15 min. After ultracentrifugation for 1 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C and two consecutive washes in assay buffer, carbonate-extracted membranes were resuspended (50 μl/10-cm dish) in assay buffer and analyzed for AICD degradation as above. Cytosol was prepared from the indicated cell lines by ultracentrifugation of the post-nuclear supernatant fraction at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The soluble S100 fraction was used as cytosol. Cytosol-free membranes were generated by three consecutive washes of membranes with assay buffer and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Cytosol-free membranes were then resuspended in assay buffer (20 μl/assay) and mixed with aliquots (5 μl) of cytosol fractions containing the indicated protein amounts. AICD was then generated as described above. In assays with insulin, AICD was first generated from cytosol-free membranes as described above. After ultracentrifugation, membrane-free S100 fractions containing preformed AICD were mixed with cytosol preparations supplemented with the indicated amounts of insulin and assayed for AICD degradation as described above. IDE-depleted cytosol preparations were generated by immunoprecipitation for 2 h at 4 °C using excess amounts of antibody 9B12 that was prebound with rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Sigma) to protein A-Sepharose. As a control a mock-immunoprecipitation lacking antibody 9B12 was carried out with rabbit anti-mouse antibody prebound to protein A-Sepharose. We and others have previously demonstrated that AICD can efficiently be generated in vitro in a γ-secretase- and PS-dependent manner from crude membrane fractions prepared by centrifugation at 10,000–16,000 × g (11.McLendon C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). However, the in vitro generated AICD is extremely rapidly degraded, and the addition of a protease inhibitor mix containing EDTA is necessary to stabilize AICD (11.McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K.A. Lewis P.A. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R. Fauq A. Golde T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 12.Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H.

To identify the protease involved in this extremely rapid degradation pathway, the in vitro assay was carried out in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors (Fig. 1). In the absence of any inhibitor, no AICD could be detected, demonstrating that at 37 °C AICD degradation is even faster than de novosynthesis. Consistent with previous results a general protease inhibitor mix including EDTA inhibited AICD degradation. The additional presence of the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT inhibited AICD generation as expected (13.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the protease inhibitor mix without EDTA did not block AICD degradation, suggesting the involvement of a divalent metal ion-dependent proteolytic activity in AICD generation. Indeed, the metal-chelators EDTA and PNT allowed robust accumulation of AICD when used either alone or in combination. However, the more specific metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and bestatin, an inhibitor of aminopeptidases, did not inhibit degradation of AICD. AICD degradation was not affected by inhibitors of cysteine proteases (E64, leupeptin), serine proteases (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and aspartyl proteases (pepstatin) (data not shown). Interestingly, the potent proteasome inhibitorsclasto-lactacystin β-lactone and MG132 also did not block AICD degradation (Fig. 1). This is in contrast to NICD that has been shown to be rapidly degraded by a ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 22.Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M.

Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34371-34378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, although AICD and NICD are both generated by a PS-dependent protease, they are degraded by different proteolytic activities. Taken together, we conclude that most likely a metalloprotease is involved in AICD degradation. We next investigated whether the metalloprotease activity involved in AICD degradation is cytosolic or membrane-bound. We first assayed crude membranes for AICD degradation after alkaline extraction with Na2CO3 that separates peripheral from integral membrane proteins (30.Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, AICD could be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA from Na2CO3-extracted membranes, suggesting that the AICD degrading activity is either peripherally attached to the membrane or soluble. In addition, these data confirm previous findings that γ-secretase is integrally membrane-bound (11.McLendon C. Xin T. Ziani-Cherif C. Murphy M.P. Findlay K.A. Lewis P.A. Pinnix I. Sambamurti K. Wang R. Fauq A. Golde T.E. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2383-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We next separated crude membranes from residual cytosol by additional centrifugation. As shown above, when crude membranes were used in the in vitro assay, AICD could not be recovered in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig. 2B) due to its rapid degradation. In contrast, when crude membranes were used after additional re-centrifugation at 100,000 × g, robust accumulation of AICD was observed in the absence of PNT/EDTA (Fig. 2B). Thus, these data suggest that the AICD degrading activity is a soluble protease that is primarily located within the cytoplasm. To further prove the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, the in vitro degradation assay was performed with washed cytosol-free membranes, which allowed robust accumulation of AICD in the absence of PNT/EDTA. The degrading activity could then be reconstituted by the addition of increasing amounts of cytosol from HEK293 or mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells (Fig. 2C). From these results we conclude that a cytoplasmic metalloprotease present in peripheral as well as in neuronal cells is involved in AICD degradation. Based on the inhibition profile and the cytoplasmic localization of the AICD degrading activity, we searched the MEROPS protease data base (www.merops.co.uk) for candidate AICD-degrading enzymes. This search revealed that three cytoplasmic candidate proteases from two metalloprotease families (M3A and M16A families) could be responsible for the degradation of AICD: thimet oligopeptidase (TOP, M3A family), neurolysin (M3A family), and IDE (insulysin, M16A family). Consistent with these candidate proteases being thiol group-dependent (31.Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32.Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 693-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the SH-alkylating agents NEM strongly inhibited AICD degradation (Fig. 3A). Next, to discriminate which of these proteases could be involved in AICD degradation, thein vitro assay was carried out in the presence or absence of dynorphin A-(1–13), a known inhibitor of TOP and neurolysin (31.Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and potentially also of IDE. The dipeptide Pro-Ile, a highly specific neurolysin inhibitor (31.Barrett A.J. Brown M.A. Dando P.M. Knight C.G. McKie N. Rawlings N.D. Serizawa A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 529-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), cFP-AAY-pAB (cFP), a potent TOP and less potent neurolysin inhibitor (33.Shrimpton C.N. Abbenante G. Lew R.A. Smith I. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and insulin, a well characterized substrate of IDE, that functions as competitive inhibitor, were investigated as well (24.Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, weak inhibition of AICD degradation by dynorphin A-(1–13) suggests either TOP or neurolysin as a candidate protease without excluding IDE. However, Pro-Ile did not block AICD degradation ruling out neurolysin as a candidate protease (Fig. 3B). Since cFP did also not block AICD degradation (Fig. 3B), IDE remained the only candidate for AICD degradation. Indeed, insulin competed for the AICD degrading activity present in cytosol derived from N2a cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). Bovine serum albumin used to control for unspecific inhibition of degradation had no effect (Fig. 3C). Similar results were obtained with cytosol from HEK293 cells (data not shown). Thus, these data indicate that IDE may be one of the AICD-degrading enzymes in N2a and HEK293 cells. To prove whether IDE is an AICD-degrading enzyme, we generated HEK293 cell lines stably overexpressing rat IDE or an inactive IDE mutant (IDE E111Q) in which the glutamate of the HXXEH active site motif was changed to glutamine (34.Becker A.B. Roth R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3835-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35.Perlman R.K. Gehm B.D. Kuo W.L. Rosner M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21538-21544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A, immunoblotting of cytosol fractions confirmed overexpression of wt and mutant IDE proteins. Cytosol fractions derived from cells overexpressing wt IDE contained significantly higher AICD degrading activity than cytosol fractions from IDE E111Q overexpressing cells (Fig. 4B). Finally, cytosol of HEK293 cells was immunodepleted of endogenous IDE by immunoprecipitation with excess amounts of an anti-IDE antibody (Fig. 4C). AICD generation was then assayed from cytosol-free membranes in the presence of these fractions. As shown in Fig. 4D, a dose-dependent AICD degradation was observed with non-depleted control fractions in contrast to a markedly reduced AICD degrading activity in IDE-depleted cytosol fractions. Thus, these data strongly suggest that IDE is a major AICD-degrading enzyme. PSs may function in facilitating nuclear signaling. Such a function is well proven for the role of PS in NICD generation. Very recently the corresponding cytoplasmic fragment of APP, AICD, has been identified (13.Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 14.Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). AICD is generated by a remarkably similar molecular mechanism like NICD (Fig. 5). If AICD functions in nuclear signaling as proposed by Cao and Südhof (16.Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar), one may expect a rapid clearance of this fragment, since constitutive uncontrolled signaling must be avoided. Indeed this is the case for NICD, which is rapidly removed by an ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway (6.De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar, 22.Oberg C. Li J. Pauley A. Wolf E. Gurney M. Lendahl U. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34371-34378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Here we show that AICD is not degraded by the proteasome but by a completely different protease, namely IDE (Fig. 5). The biochemical properties of IDE make it an ideal candidate for AICD degradation. It is highly expressed in the same cellular compartment as AICD; it is a common enzyme in brain tissue, where abundant APP expression is observed, and it preferentially degrades small cytoplasmic peptides of about 20–50 amino acids in length (for review, see Ref. 24.Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). We found an extremely rapid turnover of AICD, which even exceeds the kinetics of de novo production in vitro. This is consistent with the high levels of IDE in the cytoplasm of many cells and tissues. Although we have identified IDE as a major AICD-degrading enzyme in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lysates, we cannot exclude the possibility that other enzymes may degrade AICD in cells where IDE activity or expression is low (24.Authier F. Posner B.I. Bergeron J.J. Clin. Invest. Med. 1996; 19: 149-160PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpressed artificial 59-amino acid AICD variants have been localized to the nucleus to some extent (20.Kimberly W.T. Zheng J.B. Guenette S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40288-40292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 21.Cupers P. Orlans I. Craessaerts K. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 1168-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, this is in contrast to endogenous AICD with the correct N terminus that has so far not been detected within the nucleus. Due to the rather rapid turnover of endogenous AICD and the apparent lack of its nuclear localization, one may question a function of this small peptide in nuclear signaling. However, one needs to point out that NICD could not be detected in the nucleus for a long time, because sensitive techniques have been lacking. Indeed using hypersensitive reporter gene assays Cao and Südhof (16.Cao X. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2001; 293: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar) could provide indirect evidence that a cytoplasmic fragment of APP (which was not identical to the in vivo existing AICD) complexed with Fe65, and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60 could mediate gene transcription. However, nuclear transport of authentic AICD and the formation of a nuclear Tip60·Fe65·AICD complex remains to be shown. The identification of IDE as an AICD-degrading enzyme may facilitate research on the putative role of AICD in nuclear signaling, since this function could be strongly enhanced by the inhibition of AICD degradation. Interestingly, IDE not only degrades AICD, but is also involved in the clearance of secreted Aβ in the brain (36.Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J.

Surprisingly, Aβ-degrading IDE appears to be released from living cells (36.Vekrellis K. Ye Z. Qiu W.Q. Walsh D. Hartley D. Chesneau V. Rosner M.R. Selkoe D.J. J.

In contrast to the secreted Aβ, AICD is released into the cytoplasm where it is rapidly degraded by IDE. Since IDE is one of the Aβ-clearing enzymes, it is tempting to increase its activity to lower the amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease patients. Indeed this was the major goal behind the identification of the Aβ-degrading enzymes. The finding that IDE is not only involved in Aβ degradation but also in the removal of AICD may have important implications for therapeutic strategies involving the manipulation of IDE activity. If one assumes that AICD is required for nuclear signaling, its enhanced removal will interfere with AICD-mediated functions. Moreover, other therapeutic strategies such as the inhibition of γ-secretase activity will also interfere with AICD production. In that case a major reduction in ACID-mediated signaling may occur, which could also have detrimental implications. Careful analysis of AICD function and metabolism is therefore required not only to understand the biological function of APP in nuclear signaling but also for the safety of ongoing therapeutic trials.

The function of Akt in skeletal muscle is not well understood, and whether contractile activity stimulates Akt activity has been controversial. In the current study, contraction in situ, induced via sciatic nerve stimulation, significantly increased Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in multiple muscle types including the extensor digitorum longus (13-fold over basal), plantaris (5.8-fold), red gastrocnemius (4.7-fold), white gastrocnemius (3.3-fold), and soleus (1.6-fold). In addition to increasing phosphorylation, contraction in situ significantly increased the activity of all three Akt isoforms (Akt1 > Akt2 > Akt3) with maximal activation occurring at 2.5 min and returning to base line with 15 min of contraction. Akt phosphorylation and activity were also increased when isolated muscles were contracted in vitro in the absence of systemic factors, although to a much lesser extent. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 fully inhibited contraction-stimulated Akt phosphorylation and activity but did not diminish contraction-stimulated glycogen synthase kinase-3 phosphorylation and glycogen synthase activity. These results demonstrate that contraction increases Akt phosphorylation and activity in skeletal muscle and that this stimulation is rapid, transient, muscle fiber type-specific, and wortmannin- and LY294002-inhibitable. Akt signaling is not necessary for the regulation of glycogen synthase activity in contracting skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W2092792905,"Deductions from the molecular analysis of the 65,000-bp stigmatellin biosynthetic gene cluster are reported. The biosynthetic genes (stiA-J) encode an unusual bacterial modular type I polyketide synthase (PKS) responsible for the formation of this aromatic electron transport inhibitor produced by the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca. Involvement of the PKS gene cluster in stigmatellin biosynthesis is shown using site-directed mutagenesis. One module of the PKS is assumed to be used iteratively during the biosynthetic process, which seems to involve an unusual transacylation of the biosynthetic intermediate from an acyl carrier protein domain back to the preceding ketosynthase domain. Finally, the polyketide chain which is presumably catalyzed by a novel C-terminal domain in StiJ that does not resemble thioesterases, is cyclized and aromatized. The presented results of feeding experiments are in good agreement with the proposed biosynthetic scheme. In contrast to all other PKS type I systems reported to date, each module of StiA-J is encoded on a separate gene. The gene cluster contains a stand alone O-methyltransferase and two unusual O-methyltransferase domains embedded in the PKS. In addition, inactivation of a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase-encoding gene involved in post-PKS hydroxylation of the aromatic ring leads to the formation of two novel stigmatellin derivatives."

The results show that a torsional Alfvén wave is generated by the rotational dragging of space near the black hole. The wave transports energy along the magnetic field lines outward, causing the total energy of the plasma near the hole to decrease to negative values. When this negative energy plasma enters the horizon, the rotational energy of the black hole decreases. Through this process, the energy of the spinning black hole is extracted magnetically"

We have recently identified anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) as a tyrosine kinase receptor for pleiotrophin, a secreted growth factor that is highly expressed during embryonic brain development and in tumors of the central nervous system. Here we report on the contribution of pleiotrophin-ALK signaling to glioblastoma growth. We found ALK overexpressed in human glioblastoma relative to normal brain and detected ALK mRNA in glioblastoma cell lines. We reduced the endogenous ALK in glioblastoma cells by ribozyme targeting and demonstrated that this prevents pleiotrophin-stimulated phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Akt. Furthermore, this depletion of ALK reduced tumor growth of xenografts in athymic nude mice and prolonged survival of the animals because of increased apoptosis in the tumors. These findings directly implicate ALK signaling as a rate-limiting factor in the growth of glioblastoma multiforme and suggest potential utility of therapeutic targeting of ALK.

Tumors of glial origin including astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and ependymomas account for almost 80% of all primary brain malignancies.

In addition, these tumors frequently overexpress the ligands for these RTKs, suggesting a potential role for autocrine RTK signaling in glioblastoma growth. The importance of RTK signaling is supported by the finding that the combined activation of two downstream targets of RTK signaling (Ras and Akt) in neural progenitor cells induces glioblastoma-like tumors in mice (10.Holland E.C.

More recently, the full-length ALK receptor has been shown to be highly expressed in the developing nervous system and down-regulated postnatally (21.Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N.

Previous studies have shown that a t(2;5) translocation can generate a fusion protein of the intracellular ALK kinase domain with nucleophosmin and that this constitutively active kinase can induce anaplastic lymphoma (20.Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). In contrast with this limited role of the nucleophosmin/ALK fusion protein for lymphoid neoplasms, the full-length ALK receptor has been shown to be expressed in the developing nervous system and by virtue of its expression pattern is implicated with nervous system physiology (21.Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We now report that one of the highly malignant tumors of the brain, glioblastoma, overexpresses ALK, and we demonstrate that the pleiotrophin-ALK pathway is essential for tumor growth of one of the commonly used model systems, U87MG cells.Furthermore, our initial studies on the expression of ALK in cancers of epithelial origin showed ALK expression in one-third of breast cancer cell lines (7 of 18) and in a little over one-half of breast cancer tissues from patients (8 of 13). Still, the expression levels of ALK in breast cancers relative to normal tissues were not as prominent as in glioblastoma, and we thus focused the studies reported here on this latter tumor type. Interestingly, depletion of ALK from Hs578T breast cancer cells that express high levels of the ALK receptor as well as pleiotrophin significantly inhibited tumor growth in animals 2C. Powers, A. Aigner, G. E. Stoica, K. McDonnell, and A. Wellstein, unpublished data. very similar to the data reported here for the U87MG cells. This suggests a potentially rate-limiting role of ALK for tumor types other than glioblastoma that utilize this growth factor receptor pathway.As outlined above, the major pathway affected by the pleiotrophin-ALK interaction is apoptosis, and this begs the question as to whether the activity of apoptosis-inducing cytotoxic drugs might cooperate with this pathway. To test this hypothesis we studied the efficacy of cisplatinum, an alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma, in the U87MG cell panel. Indeed, cells with reduced residual levels of endogenous ALK become more sensitive to cisplatinum-induced apoptosis.2 This suggests the potential for a positive interaction between ALK tyrosine kinase-targeted and conventional cytotoxic therapies.In the current paper, we have utilized ribozyme targeting of ALK to generate a panel of cells with a range of residual endogenous expression of this receptor tyrosine kinase. The residual receptor levels correlated with 1) pleiotrophin induction of Akt phosphorylation, 2) tumor growth, 3) median survival, and 4) apoptosis in a gene dose-dependent manner. Finally, the tumor cells became more sensitive to a cytotoxic agent, cisplatinum, upon the reduction of ALK.2 This suggests to us that drugs that specifically inhibit the pleiotrophin-stimulated ALK kinase activity hold the promise to be efficacious against tumors that utilize this growth stimulatory axis.

This suggests a potentially rate-limiting role of ALK for tumor types other than glioblastoma that utilize this growth factor receptor pathway.As outlined above, the major pathway affected by the pleiotrophin-ALK interaction is apoptosis, and this begs the question as to whether the activity of apoptosis-inducing cytotoxic drugs might cooperate with this pathway. To test this hypothesis we studied the efficacy of cisplatinum, an alkylating agent used to treat glioblastoma, in the U87MG cell panel. Indeed, cells with reduced residual levels of endogenous ALK become more sensitive to cisplatinum-induced apoptosis.2 This suggests the potential for a positive interaction between ALK tyrosine kinase-targeted and conventional cytotoxic therapies.In the current paper, we have utilized ribozyme targeting of ALK to generate a panel of cells with a range of residual endogenous expression of this receptor tyrosine kinase. The residual receptor levels correlated with 1) pleiotrophin induction of Akt phosphorylation, 2) tumor growth, 3) median survival, and 4) apoptosis in a gene dose-dependent manner. Finally, the tumor cells became more sensitive to a cytotoxic agent, cisplatinum, upon the reduction of ALK.2 This suggests to us that drugs that specifically inhibit the pleiotrophin-stimulated ALK kinase activity hold the promise to be efficacious against tumors that utilize this growth stimulatory axis. We recently identified ALK, an orphan RTK, as the receptor for the growth factor pleiotrophin (19.Stoica G.E. Kuo A. Aigner A. Sunitha I. Souttou B. Malerczyk C. Caughey D. Wen D. Karavanov A.

Previous studies have shown that a t(2;5) translocation can generate a fusion protein of the intracellular ALK kinase domain with nucleophosmin and that this constitutively active kinase can induce anaplastic lymphoma (20.Morris S.W.

In contrast with this limited role of the nucleophosmin/ALK fusion protein for lymphoid neoplasms, the full-length ALK receptor has been shown to be expressed in the developing nervous system and by virtue of its expression pattern is implicated with nervous system physiology (21.Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). We now report that one of the highly malignant tumors of the brain, glioblastoma, overexpresses ALK, and we demonstrate that the pleiotrophin-ALK pathway is essential for tumor growth of one of the commonly used model systems, U87MG cells. Furthermore, our initial studies on the expression of ALK in cancers of epithelial origin showed ALK expression in one-third of breast cancer cell lines (7 of 18) and in a little over one-half of breast cancer tissues from patients (8 of 13). Still, the expression levels of ALK in breast cancers relative to normal tissues were not as prominent as in glioblastoma, and we thus focused the studies reported here on this latter tumor type. Interestingly, depletion of ALK from Hs578T breast cancer cells that express high levels of the ALK receptor as well as pleiotrophin significantly inhibited tumor growth in animals 2C. Powers, A.

https://openalex.org/W2026512609,"Signal-mediated nuclear import and export proceed through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Some NPC components, such as the nucleoporins (Nups) Nup98 and Nup96, are also associated with the nuclear interior. Nup98 is a target of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) matrix (M) protein–mediated inhibition of messenger RNA (mRNA) nuclear export. Here, Nup98 and Nup96 were found to be up-regulated by interferon (IFN). M protein–mediated inhibition of mRNA nuclear export was reversed when cells were treated with IFN-γ or transfected with a complementary DNA (cDNA) encoding Nup98 and Nup96. Thus, increased Nup98 and Nup96 expression constitutes an IFN-mediated mechanism that reverses M protein–mediated inhibition of gene expression."

The power spectrum of this noise is quantified. In addition, the frequency dependence of the complex shear modulus is a power law with slope one-half, indicating a distribution of relaxation processes rather than any dominant one. The physical picture emerges that whereas surface energetics encourage water to dewet the hydrophobic side of the interface, the hydrophilic side constrains water to be present, resulting in a flickering, fluctuating complex."
https://openalex.org/W2085307948,"Posttranscriptional gene silencing in Caenorhabditis elegans results from exposure to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a phenomenon designated as RNA interference (RNAi), or from co-suppression, in which transgenic DNA leads to silencing of both the transgene and the endogenous gene. Here we show that single-stranded RNA oligomers of antisense polarity can also be potent inducers of gene silencing. As is the case for co-suppression, antisense RNAs act independently of the RNAi genes rde-1 and rde-4 but require the mutator/RNAi gene mut-7 and a putative DEAD box RNA helicase, mut-14 . Our data favor the hypothesis that gene silencing is accomplished by RNA primer extension using the mRNA as template, leading to dsRNA that is subsequently degraded."
https://openalex.org/W2118391485,"The progesterone receptor (PR) can be isolated in its native conformation able to bind hormone, yet its ligand-binding domain rapidly loses its activity at elevated temperature. However, an <i>in vitro</i> chaperoning system consisting of five proteins (HSP40, HSP70, HOP, HSP90, and p23) with ATP is capable of restoring this function. The first step of this chaperoning mechanism is usually thought to be the binding of HSP70 to PR. Our findings here show that the binding of HSP40 to PR is, instead, the first step. HSP40 binding occurred rapidly and was not dependent on ATP or other proteins. The stoichiometry of HSP40 to native PR in these complexes was ∼1:1. HSP40 bound specifically and with a high affinity to native PR (<i>K</i><sub>d</sub> = 77 nm). The binding of HSP40 to PR was sustained and did not interact in the highly dynamic fashion that has been observed previously for HSP90 in this system. The HSP40·PR complex could be isolated as a functional unit that could, after the addition of the other chaperones, progress to a PR complex capable of hormone binding. These results indicate that HSP40 initiates the entry of PR into the HSP90 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1577196665,"Inflammatory processes are involved with all phases of atherosclerotic lesion growth. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) is an inflammatory cytokine that is thought to contribute to lesion development. Lymphotoxin-α (LTα) is also a proinflammatory cytokine with homology to TNFα. However, its presence or function in lesion development has not been investigated. To study the role of these molecules in atherosclerosis, the expression of these cytokines in atherosclerotic lesions was examined. The presence of both cytokines was observed within aortic sinus fatty streak lesions. To determine the function of these molecules in regulating lesion growth, mice deficient for TNFα or LTα were examined for induction of atherosclerosis. Surprisingly, loss of TNFα did not alter lesion development compared with wild-type mice. This brings doubt to the generally held concept that TNFα is a “proatherogenic cytokine.” However, LTα deficiency resulted in a 62% reduction in lesion size. This demonstrates an unexpected role for LTα in promoting lesion growth. The presence of LTα was observed in aortic sinus lesions suggesting a direct role of LTα in modulating lesion growth. To determine which receptor mediated these responses, diet-induced atherosclerosis in mice deficient for each of the TNF receptors, termed p55 and p75, was examined. Results demonstrated that loss of p55 resulted in increased lesion development, but loss of p75 did not alter lesion size.

However, the physiological role of TNF ligand and receptor family members in the atherogenic process remains unclear.TNFα and lymphotoxin-α (LTα) are two predominant members of the TNF ligand family. Their structural genes are located on human chromosome 6 within the major histocompatibility complex (6.Ware C.F. VanArsdale S. VanArsdale T.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). TNFα and LTα proteins are structurally similar and display 50% amino acid homology (7.Ware C.F. VanArsdale T.L. Crowe P.D. Browning J.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 198: 175-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). TNFα is first synthesized as a type II transmembrane protein and is subsequently cleaved to form circulating homotrimeric TNFα (8.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L.

Unlike TNFα, membrane-bound homotrimeric LTα has not been observed.

Immunol. 1998; 160: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar).In this report, we investigated whether TNFα- or LTα-mediated responses alter lesion growth. Control mice or mice deficient for either TNFα or LTα were fed an atherogenic diet, and the presence of these ligands within the lesions was examined. Confirming other reports, we observed TNFα in the atherosclerotic lesions. Surprisingly though TNFα deficiency did not alter lesion size. This brings into question the generally held concept that TNFα promotes atherogenesis. Furthermore, loss of LTα resulted in a 3-fold decrease in lesion size. These findings demonstrate that LTα is the predominant member of the TNF ligand family that elicits proatherogenic responses. Since loss of LTα decreased lesion growth but loss of the major TNF receptor, p55, resulted in increased atherosclerosis, we hypothesized that the p75 receptor was involved with regulating LTα responses to promote atherogenesis. However, we show that loss of p75 did not alter lesion development. The disparity between the results obtained with ligand-deficient versus receptor-deficient mice illustrates the complexity of this cellular signaling system and suggests that there are alternative TNF ligand/receptor molecules involved with regulating lesion growth.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMiceFemale C57BL/6CR mice, age of 6 weeks, were purchased from Charles River Breeding Laboratories and used as the wild-type control strain for studies involving receptor-deficient mice. Mice lacking either the TNF receptor p55 (p55−/−), p75 (p75−/−), or both receptors (p55−/−p75−/−) have been described previously (25.Peschon J.J. Torrance D.S. Stocking K.L. Glaccum M.B. Otten C. Willis C.R. Charrier K. Morrissey P.J. Ware C.B. Mohler K.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 943-952PubMed Google Scholar). The p55−/− mice were developed directly in C57BL/6CR and are an inbred strain. The p75−/− and p55−/−p75−/− animals represent 4–5 backcrosses onto C57BL/6CR, respectively. C57BL/6J tumor necrosis factor-α-deficient mice (TNFα−/−) and lymphotoxin-α-deficient mice (LTα−/−) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. The C57BL/6J mice were used as the wild-type control strain for the studies involving ligand-deficient mice as both the TNFα−/− and LTα−/− mice are maintained on the C57BL/6J genetic background. Mice were bred to generate colonies of each gene knockout strain here at the University of Washington. F2 and F3 offspring were used for the experiments presented in this report. Apolipoprotein E-deficient male mice (apoE−/−) maintained on the C57BL/6J genetic background were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were maintained in a temperature-controlled (25 °C) facility with a strict 12-h light/dark cycle and given free access to food and water. Blood was collected after a 4-h fast from the retro-orbital sinus into tubes containing 1 mm EDTA, and plasma was stored at −20 °C prior to analysis.Study DesignTwo experiments were performed for this study. In experiment 1, wild-type, TNFα−/− or LTα−/− female mice were fed an “atherogenic diet” containing 15% fat, 1.25% cholesterol, and 0.5% sodium cholate (diet No. TD90221, Harlan Teklad) (26.Paigen B. Morrow A. Holmes P.A. Mitchell D. Williams R.A. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 68: 231-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). This diet induces fatty streak lesions in the aortas of susceptible mice (27.Paigen B. Mitchell D. Reue K. Morrow A. Lusis A.J. LeBoeuf R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3763-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 28.Paigen B. Ishida B.Y. Verstuyft J. Winters R.B. Albee D. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 316-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were fed the diet for 16 weeks before quantifying lesion areas. In experiment 2, wild-type and TNF receptor-deficient mice were fed the atherogenic diet for 18 weeks before quantifying lesion development. For both studies, an additional set of female mice were fed a rodent chow diet (Wayne Rodent BLOX 8604, Harlan Teklad) for 16–18 weeks prior to analyzing plasma lipids and lesion areas. ApoE−/− mice were maintained on a rodent chow diet until 22 weeks of age before they were evaluated for aortic sinus lesions and the presence of TNFα or LTα.Plasma AnalysisTotal cholesterol and triglycerides were determined using established colorimetric assays as described (29.Kunjathoor V.V. Wilson D.L. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 30.Schreyer S.A. Wilson D.L. LeBoeuf R.C. Atherosclerosis. 1998; 136: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) (kits 1127578 and 450032, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Plasma lipoproteins were separated by FPLC gel filtration using a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences). A 100-μl aliquot of plasma from each of 3–4 mice per diet group was separated at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min using phosphate-buffered saline. 100-μl aliquots from each of 0.5-ml fractions were used for cholesterol determinations.Aortic Sinus Lesion QuantificationAortic sinus lesion areas were quantified as described (21.Schreyer S.A. Peschon J.J. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26174-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 29.Kunjathoor V.V. Wilson D.L. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Hearts were removed from mice, perfused with phosphate-buffered saline, and formalin fixed using a 4% neutral formalin solution. After removing peripheral fat, the heart was sectioned directly under and parallel to the atrial leaflets. The upper section was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing 30% sucrose for 18 h and then embedded in O.C.T. embedding medium and frozen. Every other section (10-μm thick) throughout the aortic sinus was taken for analysis. Sections were evaluated for fatty streak lesions following lipid staining with oil red O and nuclei staining using hematoxylin. Lesion area measurements were analyzed using the Optimas Image Analysis Software Package (BioScan).ImmunohistochemistryFrozen sections were fixed in acetone and endogenous peroxidase quenched by incubating slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide. Samples were then incubated with either a polyclonal anti-TNFα antibody (RDI-mTNFAabrP, Research Diagnostics, Inc.) at 1:30 dilution or with a polyclonal anti-LTα antibody (RDI-TNFBabr1, Research Diagnostics, Inc.) at 1:30 dilution. After rinsing samples were incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (BA1000, Vector Laboratories) at 1:200 and binding detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase followed by AEC colorimetric product formation using the Histomouse kit (95-9541, Zymed Laboratories Inc.). To stain for macrophages, a rat anti-mouse CD11b antibody was used (01711D, BD PharMingen) at 1:00 dilution. To stain for T cells, a rat anti-mouse CD3 antibody was used (28001D, BD PharMingen) at 1:100 dilution. Binding for CD11b and CD3 was detected using a biotinylated secondary antibody (B7139, Sigma-Aldrich) followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and AEC detection as described above. Deletion of either the primary or secondary antibody resulted in minimal to no staining.Statistical AnalysisValues are reported as mean ± S.E. Nonparametric Wilcoxon signed ranks tests were used to determine differences in lesion areas. The Student's t test was used to compare independent means in some cases. p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant.RESULTSLTα Is Expressed in Atherosclerotic LesionsAortic sinus lesions from atherogenic diet-fed wild-type female mice and chow-fed apoE−/− male mice were evaluated for the expression of TNFα and LTα. Lesions from atherogenic diet-fed mice are comprised predominantly of macrophages with small amounts of T and B cells present (31.Qiao J.-H. Xie P.-Z. Fishbein M.C. Kreuzer J. Drake T.A. Demer L.L.

Biol. 1999; 19: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, lesions from apoE−/− mice contain macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and T and B cells (34.Paulsson G. Zhou X. Törnquist E. Hansson G.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 35.Zhou X. Hansson G.K. Scan. J. Immunol. 1999; 50: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, these two systems provide examples of early simple fatty streak lesions and more complex lesions as observed in human atherosclerosis (36.Hansson G.K. Jonasson L. Seifert P.S. Stemme S. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 567-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TNFα immunostaining was observed in lesions from both of these models (Fig. 1). Staining was punctate indicating cell-associated protein expression and was also observed within the medial smooth muscle cell layer under the lesioned sites. Surprisingly however, LTα staining was also observed in lesions from both of these models (Fig. 1). Immunostaining was observed throughout the lesions and medial layers. In general, the staining was more diffuse than the staining observed for TNFα. We next confirmed that the immunoreactivity we observed did not simply reflect cross-reactivity of these antibodies to the different ligands. Lesions from atherogenic diet-fed TNFα−/− and LTα−/− mice were immunostained for TNFα and LTα (Fig. 2). Results demonstrate that lesions from TNFα−/− mice did not show immunoreactivity against the TNFα antibody, and lesions from LTα−/− mice did not show reactivity against the LTα antibody. Furthermore, loss of one ligand did not impede the expression of the other ligand within these lesions.Figure 2Lipid and immunostaining of aortic sinus lesions from TNF α−/− and LTα−/− mice (top and bottom, respectively).

Lesions from apoE−/− mice were immunostained for macrophages using the CD11b marker, for T cells using the CD3 marker, and for LTα (Fig. 3). Results show that lesions from apoE−/− mice contain both of these cell types and that LTα expression is not confined to a specific cell type. The diffuse nature of LTα immunostaining suggests that this protein is secreted from one of these cell types and has become trapped within the extracellular matrix and necrotic regions of these lesions. Further investigation about the cellular source of LTα within the lesion remains to be determined.Figure 3Immunostaining of aortic sinus lesions from chow-fed apoE−/− mice.

Aortic lesion areas were quantified for wild-type, TNFα−/− and LTα−/− female mice fed the atherogenic diet for 16 weeks (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, loss of TNFα did not alter lesions sizes (10.9 ± 2.4 μm2 × 103, n = 18) as compared with wild-type mice (11.5 ± 2.3 μm2 × 103, n = 11). In contrast, lesion areas in LTα−/− mice were reduced (4.3 ± 1.4 μm2 × 103, n = 13 and p = 0.0128). These data are consistent with the idea that LTα is the primary TNF family ligand involved with atherosclerosis.Figure 4Aortic sinus lesion areas for female mice fed the atherogenic diet for 16 weeks.

As compared with atherogenic diet-fed wild-type mice, cholesterol levels were 46% higher in TNFα−/− mice (p = 0.10 versus wild-type mice) and 20% lower in LTα−/− mice (p = 0.05). Final values were 189 ± 19 mg/dl for wild-type, 276 ± 42 mg/dl for TNFα−/−, and 151 ± 6 mg/dl for LTα−/− mice. Total cholesterol levels did not correlate with lesion areas for any of the strains fed the atherogenic diet. Triglyceride levels were ∼11–16 mg/dl for all atherogenic diet-fed mice, and no significant differences were observed among strains.To determine whether lipids were redistributed into different lipoprotein particles in atherogenic diet-fed TNFα−/− or LTα−/− mice, FPLC profiles of lipoproteins were examined (Fig. 5). No differences in the proportion of cholesterol in the VLDL/LDL to HDL fractions was observed between wild-type and TNFα−/− mice. That is, the increase in total cholesterol levels observed in TNFα−/− mice reflects a proportional increase in both VLDL/LDL and HDL lipoprotein fractions. In contrast the relative amount of total cholesterol found in the HDL fraction tended to be increased for LTα−/− mice. The combination of lower total cholesterol and higher relative amounts of cholesterol found in the HDL fraction likely accounts at least partially for the reduced lesion development observed for LTα−/− mice.Figure 5Representative FPLC profile for female mice fed the atherogenic diet. Data are presented as the percent of total cholesterol found in each fraction and represents the mean values obtained from 3 to 4 mice per group.

Since neither the LTα−/− nor the TNFα−/− mice recapitulated these results, we hypothesized that signaling via the p75 receptor influences lesion development. Wild-type, p55−/−, p75−/−, and p55−/−p75−/− female mice were fed the atherogenic diet for 18 weeks, and aortic sinus lesion areas were quantified (Fig. 6). Results demonstrate that loss of p55 resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in lesion size, confirming our previous result (21.Schreyer S.A. Peschon J.J. LeBoeuf R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26174-26178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Loss of p75 did not alter lesion development, and loss of both p55 and p75 receptors resulted in lesion areas comparable with those observed for p55−/− mice. No significant differences in plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides were observed between genotypes (data not shown). Thus the p55 receptor signals events that retard lesion development, whereas p75 signaling does not influence lesion development.Figure 6Aortic sinus lesion areas for female mice fed the atherogenic diet for 18 weeks.

This is the first report demonstrating that LTα is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions and that loss of this cytokine reduces lesion size. Surprisingly, loss of TNFα, which is involved with numerous proinflammatory responses, did not alter lesion development in atherogenic diet-fed mice. Loss of p55 receptors, but not p75 receptors, resulted in increased diet-induced atherosclerosis showing that the p55 receptor has the predominant role in regulating lesion growth. Taken together these results illustrate the complexity of TNF ligand and receptor interactions in modulating inflammatory responses such as those observed during lesion growth. Furthermore, since the ligand deficiency did not recapitulate the responses we observed with the receptor deficiency it suggests that there are undefined members of the TNF ligand or receptor signaling pathway involved with regulating atherogenesis.The observations that LTα is expressed within atherosclerotic lesions and deficiency of this protein retards lesion development suggests that there may be a direct function of LTα in promoting atherogenesis. LTα is produced primarily from T and B cells (37.Browning J.L. Sizing I.D. Lawton P. Bourdon P.R. Rennert P.D. Majeau G.M. Ambrose C.M. Hession C. Miatkowski K. Griffiths D.A. Ngam-ek A. Meier W.

Both of these cell types have been identified in atherosclerotic lesions with the extent of their presence dependent on the animal model and on the stage of lesion size or complexity (35.Zhou X.

For example RAG−/− mice have impaired T and B cell function such that T lymphocytes do not mature into CD4+ helper or CD8+ suppressor cells, and B cells are unable to synthesize immunoglobulin (42.Mombaerts P.

The gall bladder and extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBD) develop from the caudal portion of the liver primordium at 10 dpc of mouse embryogenesis (9.Shiojiri N. Microsc. Res.

However, little is known regarding visceral (splanchnic) mesoderm transcription factors that regulate expression of genes involved in mesenchymal-epithelial induction of gall bladder development from the liver primordium. Visceral mesenchymal expression of the homeodomain Hlx gene is required for the proliferative expansion required for mouse liver and intestine morphogenesis, but it is not essential for normal specification of the liver primordium (10.Hentsch B.

Expression of Foxf1 is restricted to the visceral (splanchnic) mesoderm, which provides mesenchymal-epithelial signaling for gut-derived organs such as liver, gall bladder, lung, stomach, pancreas, and intestine (20.Peterson R.S.

The Foxf1 gene is required for mesodermal differentiation and cell adhesion and its disruption results in embryonic lethality at midgestation (22.Mahlapuu M. Ormestad M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Development. 2001; 128: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1 gene in heterozygous mice causes perinatal lethality from pulmonary hemorrhage with severe defects in formation of alveolar sacs and capillaries and fusion of the lung lobes (23.Kalinichenko V.V.

This pulmonary defect is associated with diminished expression of Bmp-4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor type 2 (Flk-1), and the transcription factors of the brachyury T-box family (Tbx2-Tbx5) and lung Kruppel-like factor (23.Kalinichenko V.V.

In this study, we show that Foxf1 is expressed in mouse embryonic septum transversum and that Foxf1 haploinsufficiency results in abnormal development of the gall bladders. Foxf1+/− gall bladders exhibited malformation of the external smooth muscle cell layer, reduction in mesenchymal cell number, and in some cases, lack of a discernible biliary epithelial cell layer. Abnormalities in gall bladder formation are associated with diminished expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), α5 integrin, platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα), and HGF. Normal development of the liver and intrahepatic bile ducts was found in Foxf1+/− mice, and this was associated with compensatory increase in hepatic Foxf1 levels. We previously described the generation of heterozygous (+/−) Foxf1 mice in which the Foxf1 allele was disrupted by an in-frame insertion of a nuclear-localizing β-galactosidase (β-gal) gene, and thus staining for β-gal enzyme activity allowed identification of Foxf1-expressing cells (23.Kalinichenko V.V.

Foxf1+/− mice used in the gall bladder analysis were bred for three or four generations into the Black Swiss mouse genetic background. Both male and female Foxf1+/− mice exhibited similar defects in gall bladder formation. Paraffin sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for morphological examination or used for immunohistochemistry as described previously (23.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B.

To develop a Foxf1 Ab, rabbits were immunized with mouse Foxf1 RYHSQSPSMCDRKE peptide (Foxf1 amino acids 327–340) conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) protein using Sigma Genosys custom peptide antisera service. The Foxf1 peptide Ab was affinity-purified using the same peptide coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and eluted from the column as described previously (27.Jacob A.

For immunohistochemical staining with the Foxf1 peptide Ab, paraffin was removed from the tissue section, was rehydrated, and was then incubated for 15 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20 μg/ml of proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The Foxf1 peptide Ab was used at 1:100 dilution and visualized using biotinylated anti-rabbit Ab (BD PharMingen), avidin-alkaline phosphatase complex, and BCIP/NBT substrate (Vector Laboratory). To determine Foxf1-expressing cells, Foxf1+/− embryos or liver tissue containing gall bladder (15 dpc and adult) were stained for β-gal activity with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside substrate and paraffin-embedded and sectioned as described previously (23.Kalinichenko V.V.

Total RNA from the gall bladder was prepared using RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test B Inc. Friendswood, TX). We pooled RNA from either three wild type or eight Foxf1+/− 18-dpc embryonic gall bladders for RT-PCR. RNA was prepared individually from the gall bladders of adult mice. RT-PCRs were performed using SUPERSCRIPTTM One-Step RT-PCR with PLATINUM® Taq kit (Invitrogen, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations following an initial DNaseI digestion step as described by Duncan et al.

Two different RNA concentrations were used for RT-PCR reactions to ensure that RT-PCR conditions were in the linear range. Quantitation of expression levels was determined with Tiff files of ethidium bromide-stained gels by using the BioMax 1D program (Kodak).

Detection of the immune complex was accomplished by using secondary Ab directly conjugated with horseradish peroxidase followed by chemiluminescence (ECL+plus, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Quantitation of expression levels was determined with Tiff files from scanned films by using the BioMax 1D program. The CDK2 expression signal was used for normalization control between different protein samples. Foxf1+/− mice either lacked a discernible gall bladder or possessed significantly smaller gall bladders with severe structural abnormalities. Examination of 25 adult Foxf1+/− mice revealed that ∼49% of adult Foxf1+/− mice lacked a discernible gall bladder (Fig. 1, A and B), another 49% of the heterozygous mice possessed a rudimentary gall bladder, and 2% exhibited normal gall bladder formation. Histological examination of the rudimentary Foxf1+/− gall bladders (Fig. 1, D–F) demonstrated that they consisted of either a constricted lumen with few convolutions (Fig. 1D) or a collection of extrahepatic bile ducts (Fig. 1, E and F) compared with wild type gall bladder (Fig. 1C). Because the targeted Foxf1 allele possesses an in-frame insertion of the nuclear-localizing β-gal gene, staining for β-gal enzyme activity allows the identification of Foxf1-expressing cells (23.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 26.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Shin B. Costa R.H. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L695-L704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In 9.5-dpc Foxf1+/− embryos, β-gal staining was found in the septum transversum mesoderm of the hepatic primordium (HP) and visceral mesenchyme juxtaposed to foregut (Fg) endoderm (Fig. 2, B and C), suggesting that Foxf1 regulates mesenchymal genes involved in liver and gall bladder development. In 15-dpc Foxf1+/− mouse embryos, β-gal staining was observed in the gall bladder mesenchyme surrounding the biliary epithelial cell layer and in mesenchymal cells of the liver, but Foxf1 expression was not detected in the vessel mesenchyme (Fig. 2G). In adult Foxf1+/− mice, β-gal staining was found in mesenchymal cells of the gall bladder (Fig. 2I), extrahepatic bile duct (Fig. 2J), and hepatic sinusoids (Fig. 2K), but no Foxf1 expression was detected in either heterozygous (Fig. 2K) or wild type (data not shown) IHBD. Although embryonic 13-, 15-, and 18-dpc Foxf1+/− mice displayed variation in severity of their gall bladder defects, all of them exhibited significant reduction in the mesenchymal cell layer (Fig. 2, E, G, H, M, and N) compared with that of wild type gall bladder (Fig. 2, D, F, and L). The entire mesenchymal layer displayed Foxf1-dependent β−gal enzyme staining in 15-dpc Foxf1+/− gall bladders (Fig. 2, G and H). We identified a subset of Foxf1+/− mouse gall bladders that lacked the biliary epithelial cell layer (Fig. 2, H and N) as evidenced by undetectable immunohistochemical staining with cytokeratin (Fig. 3C, CK) compared with either wild type (Fig. 3A) or less severely affected Foxf1+/− gall bladder (Fig. 3B). The large vessels adjacent to the Foxf1+/− gall bladder exhibited normal development of the endothelial cells as evidenced by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated isolectin B4 (Fig. 3, A–C, GS), a finding consistent with the lack of Foxf1 expression in large vessels (Fig. 2, G–H). Furthermore, RT-PCR expression analysis of three discernible adult Foxf1+/− gall bladders revealed a 90% decrease in expression of the HNF6, HNF3β, and Hex transcription factors, suggesting that they lacked a normal epithelial cell layer (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Foxf1+/− mice exhibit defects in the development of epithelial cells in the gall bladder, possibly due to reduced mesenchymal signaling.Figure 4Defects in Foxf1 +/− gall bladder are associated with decrease in Foxf1, VCAM-1, α5 integrin, and HGF levels. RT-PCR reactions were performed with the indicated primers using either 18-dpc (B) or adult (A) gall bladder (GB) RNA. RNA was pooled from either three wild type or eight Foxf1+/− 18-dpc embryonic gall bladders, or RNA was prepared individually from the gall bladder of adult mice. RNA levels were normalized to cyclophilin, and the numbers below each panel represent the average of expression levels in Foxf1+/− gall bladder with respect to the wild type gall bladder (± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Even in the severely affected Foxf1+/− gall bladders, the heterozygous liver architecture (data not shown) as well as the cytokeratin staining pattern (Fig. 3, E–F) and structure of intrahepatic bile ducts (Fig. 3H, IHBD) was indistinguishable from that of wild type liver (Fig. 3, D and G). Furthermore, Foxf1+/− mice displayed wild type liver function as determined by normal serum levels of liver aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase enzymes, glucose, bilirubin, and albumin (Table I). Interestingly, RNase protection assays demonstrated that 18-dpc Foxf1+/− liver displays a 3-fold compensatory increase in Foxf1 mRNA levels compared with wild type livers (Fig. 3I).Table ISerum analysis of Foxf1+/− miceMouse strainMean level in serum ± S.D. of:ASTALTALPGlucoseBilirubinAlbuminunits/lunits/lunits/lmg/dlmg/dlg/dlWT175 ± 7428 ± 485 ± 22185 ± 410.7 ± 0.33.2 ± 0.5Foxf1+/−94 ± 1930 ± 5103 ± 20229 ± 550.6 ± 0.33.3 ± 0.2Reference range72–28824–14045–222124–2620.1–0.92.6–4.6Mouse serum was isolated from either wild type (WT) or Foxf1+/− mice, and the Biological Research Laboratories (BRL) at University of Illinois at Chicago performed all of the serum measurements.

Abbreviations: aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). RT-PCR analysis of Foxf1+/− gall bladder RNA showed that defective gall bladder formation was associated with a 70% reduction in Foxf1 levels (Fig. 4, A and B). This finding is consistent with Foxf1+/− pulmonary defects, which were also associated with 80% reduction in Foxf1 mRNA levels (23.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Because expression of the cell adhesion α5 integrin and VCAM-1 genes is essential for mesoderm formation (22.Mahlapuu M. Ormestad M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Development. 2001; 128: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we examined their levels in Foxf1+/− gall bladders. RT-PCR analysis showed a drastic reduction in VCAM-1 and α5 integrin expression in Foxf1+/− gall bladders, suggesting that their diminished levels contribute to the observed mesenchymal defect (Fig. 4, A and B). Furthermore, reduced expression of HGF was found in Foxf1+/− embryonic and adult gall bladders (Fig. 4, A and B). Because HGF plays a critical role in liver and bile duct morphogenesis (7.Schmidt C.

Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 300: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the decline in HGF expression may explain defective formation of Foxf1+/− gall bladders. We generated an affinity-purified Foxf1 peptide antibody to determine the Foxf1 expression pattern in gall bladder using immunohistochemical staining. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the Foxf1 antibody detects an appropriate 39-kDa protein using protein extracts prepared from lung, a tissue that expresses high levels of Foxf1 (Fig. 5A). Immunohistochemical staining of 18-dpc wild type gall bladder with this affinity-purified Foxf1 peptide antibody demonstrated that mesenchymal Foxf1 staining gradually decreased toward the smooth muscle cell layer (Fig. 6A), and its expression continued in the submucosa and mucosa mesenchyme of the adult gall bladder (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, this Foxf1 protein expression pattern was significantly diminished in embryonic and adult Foxf1+/− gall bladders (Fig. 6, B and D), confirming the reduction in Foxf1 mRNA levels.Figure 6Reduced number of smooth muscle cells in Foxf1 +/− gall bladder is associated with diminished expression of PDGFRα. Mouse embryonic (18 dpc) or adult wild type or Foxf1+/− gall bladder sections were used for immunohistochemical staining with either Foxf1 (A–D), αSM (E–H), or PDGFRα (I–L) antibodies (purple) and then counterstained with nuclear fast red (red). The specificity of the Foxf1 antibody was verified by Western blot analysis using lung protein extracts (see the legend to Fig. 5).

Western blot analysis with protein extracts from Foxf1+/− and wild type gall bladders supported this diminished expression in heterozygous αSM protein levels, whereas β−actin protein levels remained unchanged (Fig. 5B). Because PDGFRα is critical for differentiation of smooth muscle cell (27.Jacob A. Budhiraja S. Qian X. Clevidence D. Costa R.H. Reichel R.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2126-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), we examined its expression in Foxf1+/− gall bladders. In wild type gall bladder, high expression levels of PDGFRα protein were found in the mesenchymal cells juxtaposed to the epithelial cell layer (Fig. 6, I and K). In contrast, PDGFRα immunohistochemical staining was barely detectable in Foxf1+/− gall bladders (Fig. 6, J and L). Western blot analysis revealed a 95% reduction in PDGFRα protein expression compared with wild type gall bladder (Fig. 5B), suggesting that its diminished levels contributes to defective formation of smooth muscle cells in Foxf1+/− gall bladder. The Foxf1 protein is a potent transcriptional activator and its expression is restricted to the visceral (splanchnic) mesoderm, which expresses genes involved in mesenchymal-epithelial signaling required for development of foregut-derived organs (20.Peterson R.S. Lim L. Ye H. Zhou H. Overdier D.G. Costa R.H. Mech. Dev. 1997; 69: 53-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21.Mahlapuu M. Pelto-Huikko M. Aitola M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Dev. Biol. 1998; 202: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1 gene caused lung hemorrhage and perinatal lethality in a subset of Foxf1+/− newborn mice that exhibited an 80% reduction in wild type pulmonary Foxf1 levels (23.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Abnormalities in pulmonary alveolarization and vascularization and increased apoptosis of mesenchymal cells were associated with the severe Foxf1+/− phenotype (23.Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Beer-Stoltz D. Shin B. Rausa F.M. Clark J. Whitsett J.A. Watkins S.C. Costa R.H. Dev. Biol. 2001; 235: 489-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that Foxf1 haploinsufficiency also resulted in defective formation of the gall bladder, which was associated with a 70% reduction in wild type Foxf1 mRNA levels. Similar to many heterozygous phenotypes, Foxf1+/− embryos show differences in the severity of the gall bladder defect, and its severe phenotype does not exhibit total penetrance. The Foxf1+/− mice either lacked an appreciable gall bladder or possessed a smaller rudimentary structure with severe abnormalities. All of the Foxf1+/− gall bladders displayed a significant reduction in cell numbers within the mesenchymal layers, paucity of smooth muscle cells, and in some cases, lack of a discernible biliary epithelial cell layer. These gall bladder defects are associated with reduced expression of cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and α5 integrin as well as diminished levels of signal transduction PDGFRα and HGF proteins. Collectively, our data demonstrate that Foxf1 regulates expression of mesenchymal genes required for proper gall bladder development and function. We used Foxf1+/− embryos with a β−gal knock-in gene to demonstrate that Foxf1 is expressed in septum transversum mesenchyme during formation of the hepatic primordium and induction of gall bladder development. Although Foxf1 expression continues in the mesenchymal cells of the liver sinusoids, we found no defects in hepatic architecture, and serum analysis demonstrated that liver function was normal in Foxf1+/− mice. Interestingly, unlike the gall bladder, we found that Foxf1+/− livers exhibited an increase in Foxf1 mRNA, suggesting the possibility that its compensatory increase prevents defects in liver development. Moreover, Foxf1 is not expressed in the mesenchyme of the IHBD, and we found that Foxf1+/− liver exhibited no defects in IHBD. In vivo transplantation studies indicate that bile ducts differentiate abundantly when fetal liver tissue was placed adjacent to mesenchyme (9.Shiojiri N. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1997; 39: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), suggesting that bile duct development requires mesenchymal signaling. Moreover, the mesenchyme-derived HGF has been shown to induce lumen formation in cultures of epithelial cell lines and to promote cyst maturation and proliferation of gall bladder epithelial cells (9.Shiojiri N. Microsc. Res. Technol. 1997; 39: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 31.Mori M. Miyazaki K. Cell Tissue Res. 2000; 300: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Our data show that HGF expression is significantly reduced in Foxf1+/− gall bladders and may therefore contribute to the mesenchymal and epithelial cell defects found in Foxf1+/− gall bladder. Our finding that the HGF promoter region contains potential binding sites for the Foxf1 transcription factor (12.Costa R.H. Kalinichenko V.V. Lim L. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2001; 280: L823-L838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests the possibility that Foxf1 directly regulates transcription of the HGF gene. Moreover, the most severely affected Foxf1+/− gall bladders lack a discernible biliary epithelial cell layer as evidenced by lack of expression of cytokeratin and the transcription factors Hex, HNF-6, and HNF-3β. Because epithelial cells secrete growth factors that impinge upon development of the mesenchymal cells, it is interesting to note that Foxf1+/− gall bladder lacking an biliary epithelial cell layer possess more severe defects in the mesenchymal cells (Figs.2H and 3C). We also observed that Foxf1+/− gall bladders show significant reduction in expression of α-smooth muscle actin, indicating that they lack a discernible external smooth muscle cell layer. Although Foxf1+/− gall bladders possess fewer mesenchymal cells, we observed almost undetectable levels of PDGFRα, α5 integrin, and VCAM-1 in developing Foxf1+/− gall bladders (Figs. 4B and 5B), which cannot be explained solely by the reduction of mesenchymal cells. Our data suggest that reduced Foxf1 levels in heterozygous gall bladders are associated with diminished expression of these mesenchymal receptor and cell adhesion proteins. Mice containing a homozygous mutation for the PDGFRα gene exhibit disrupted formation and differentiation of smooth muscle cells in the developing intestinal tract (32.Karlsson L. Lindahl P. Heath J.K. Betsholtz C. Development. 2000; 127: 3457-3466PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that diminished mesenchyme expression of PDGFRα may contribute to the smooth muscle defect in Foxf1+/− gall bladders. Because HGF signaling has been implicated in smooth muscle cell migration (33.Aoyagi M. Yamamoto S. Azuma H. Yamamoto M. Tamaki M. Niimi Y. Hirakawa K. Yamamoto K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 111: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), diminished HGF levels may also contribute to the reduced smooth muscle cell layer in Foxf1+/− gall bladder. This defective cell migration may be further exacerbated because of the diminished expression of cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1 and α5integrin. Moreover, because proper expression of α5integrin and VCAM-1 is essential for mesoderm formation (22.Mahlapuu M. Ormestad M. Enerback S. Carlsson P. Development. 2001; 128: 155-166PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Yang J.T. Rayburn H. Hynes R.O. Development. 1993; 119: 1093-1105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its decreased levels in Foxf1+/− gall bladders provide a potential explanation for the observed mesenchyme defects. In summary, we show that haploinsufficiency of the Foxf1 gene causes defects in gall bladder development characterized by abnormalities in the mesenchymal, smooth muscle, and biliary epithelial cell layers. This gall bladder phenotype is associated with decreased expression of VCAM-1, α5 integrin, PDGFRα, and HGF genes, which are critical for cell adhesion, migration, and mesenchymal cell differentiation. Collectively, our data suggest that wild type levels of Foxf1 are necessary to regulate expression of mesenchymal genes, whose expression is essential for proper gall bladder development. We thank L. Lim for assisting us with the early Foxf1+/− embryos and F. Rausa, A.-X. Holterman, and P. Raychaudhuri for critically reviewing the manuscript."

We show that additional mechanisms ensure that axons maintain their correct positioning in defined axonal tracts. After termination of axonal outgrowth and target recognition, axons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of Caenorhabditis elegans require the presence of a specific VNC neuron, PVT, to maintain their correct positioning in the left and right fascicles of the VNC. PVT may exert its stabilizing function by the temporally tightly controlled secretion of 2-immunoglobulin (Ig)-domain proteins encoded by the zig genes. Dedicated axon maintenance mechanisms may be widely used to ensure the preservation of functional neuronal circuitries."

It is thought that the F-actin binding activity of IQGAP1 is regulated by its reversible association with these signaling molecules, but the mechanisms have remained obscure. Here we describe the regulatory mechanism for calmodulin. Purified adrenal IQGAP1 was found to consist of two distinct protein pools, one of which bound F-actin and lacked calmodulin, and the other of which did not bind F-actin but was tightly associated with calmodulin. Based on this finding we hypothesized that calmodulin negatively regulates binding of IQGAP1 to F-actin. This hypothesis was tested in vitro using recombinant wild type and mutated IQGAP1s and in live cells that transiently expressed IQGAP1-YFP. In vitro, the affinity of wild type IQGAP1 for F-actin decreased with increasing concentrations of calmodulin, and this effect was dramatically enhanced by Ca2+ and required the IQ domains of IQGAP1. In addition, we found that calmodulin bound wild type IQGAP1 much more efficiently in the presence of Ca2+ than EGTA, and all 8 IQ motifs in each IQGAP1 dimer could bind calmodulin simultaneously. In live cells, IQGAP1-YFP localized to the cell cortex, but elevation of intracellular Ca2+ reversibly induced the fluorescent fusion protein to become diffusely distributed. Taken together, these results support a model in which a rise in free intracellular Ca2+ promotes binding of calmodulin to IQGAP1, which in turn inhibits IQGAP1 from binding to cortical actin filaments.

Actin filament organization in the cell is regulated by a diverse set of factors that collectively control actin polymerization, actin filament length, interfilament cross-links, and interactions of polymerized actin with other cytoskeletal systems and membranes.

Although some of these proteins do not contain every major structural motif of IQGAP1, they are sufficiently similar to IQGAP1 to be classified as members of the IQGAP protein family. In addition to binding F-actin, Cdc42, Rac1, and calmodulin, IQGAP1 has also been reported to bind β-catenin (18.Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K. Nakamura T. Ookubo T. Izawa I. Nagase T.

Bernards A. Herion D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In light of its numerous structural motifs and binding partners, it seems likely that the integration of input from multiple signaling pathways determines which proteins are bound to IQGAP1 at any moment. Supporting this idea is the competitive binding to IQGAP1 that has been described between Ca2+/calmodulin and activated Cdc42 (8.Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.-D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J.

Similarly, we reported previously (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) that exogenous calmodulin modestly inhibited binding of F-actin to native IQGAP1 purified from bovine adrenal tissue. In the present report, we describe our more recent efforts to clarify how calmodulin influences the binding of IQGAP1 to F-actin. The protein contents of F-actin-binding and non-binding pools of native IQGAP1 were analyzed in further detail. In addition, recombinant full-length and mutant versions of human IQGAP1 were assayed for interactions with calmodulin in the absence and presence of free Ca2+ and with F-actin in the absence and presence of free Ca2+, calmodulin, and Ca2+/calmodulin. The net results of this study suggest that local rises in free intracellular Ca2+ stimulate binding of calmodulin to the IQ motifs on IQGAP1, which in turn reduces the affinity of IQGAP1 for actin filaments. Biochemical, molecular biological, immunochemical, and tissue culture reagents used for this study and their respective vendors are as follows: A23187 Ca2+ ionophore and bovine calmodulin (Calbiochem); Sf9 cells, insect cell media, insect cell antibiotics, the Bac-to-Bac HT expression system, Elongase Amplification System, and the pFastBAC HT vector (Invitrogen); the bacterial strain, BL21DE3, and the pRSET expression vectors (Invitrogen); Tris, TEMED, 40% acrylamide solution (37.5:1), and 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-Rad); AlexaFluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR); secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard & Perry, Gaithersburg, MD); the pSL1180 vector and calmodulin-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences); the pBlueScript II SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA); restriction enzymes (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA); oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, IA); the BacPAK Baculovirus Rapid Titer kit and pEYFPN1 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA); Centriprep concentrators (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA); Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes and GelCode Blue staining reagent (Pierce); nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose purification resin (Qiagen, Valencia, CA); anti-calmodulin monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, and LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen); cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT); [α-32P]GTP (ICN, Irvine, CA); Expand Long Template PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); pGEM-T Easy vector I (Promega, Madison, WI). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents and chemicals were acquired from Sigma. A pBlueScript II SK(+) plasmid containing the human cDNA for IQGAP1 (pBSIQG1-MH) was kindly provided by Dr. Matt Hart of Onyx Pharmaceuticals. This plasmid was digested with XbaI, and the 694-bp insert containing a portion of the 3′-UTR sequence was removed, and the remaining cDNA was ligated together to form pBSIQG1-2. Next the 5′-UTR was removed by digesting pBSIQG1-2 with NcoI and XhoI. This produced a 523-bp insert that contained not only the 5′-UTR but also 365 nucleotides of the 5′-coding region. The 523-bp insert was removed, and the remaining vector fragment was ligated to a similarly digested 371-bp PCR fragment (see under “PCR Amplification of DNA”) that restored the 365 nucleotides of the coding region and introduced an XhoI restriction site 5′ to the start codon. We took the resulting plasmid (pBSIQG-10) and performed a XhoI/XbaI double digest, purified the ∼5500-bp fragment, and ligated it into a similarly digested pSL1180 vector generating the pSLIQG-1 plasmid. Next, to remove the remaining 3′-UTR, the pSLIQG-1 plasmid was digested with KpnI and XbaI, and the vector was purified away from an ∼1100-bp insert. Because this digest removed not only the 3′-UTR but also 500 nucleotides of C-terminal coding region, the purified vector fragment was ligated onto a similarly digested 500-bp PCR fragment (see under “PCR Amplification of DNA”) to restore the missing coding region and to introduce 3 stop codons and an XbaI site (pSLIQG-2). Finally, pSLIQG-2 was digested with XhoI and XbaI; the 6500-bp insert was purified and then ligated into a pFastBAC HT vector that had been digested with SalI and XbaI. The resulting plasmid (pFBIQG1) was then used to generate baculovirus expressing IQGAP1FL, the full-length wild type protein (see under “Generation of IQGAP1-containing Baculovirus Particles”). To generate the IQGAP1ΔIQ mutant, which lacks the four contiguous IQ motifs but is otherwise identical to IQGAP1FL, we first digested the pSL1180 vector with BglII and BamHI, removed the 31-nucleotide insert, and ligated the vector together creating the vector pSLΔBglII/BamHI. Next, pSLIQG-2 was digested with XhoI and XbaI, and the resulting 6500-bp IQGAP1 fragment was purified and ligated into similarly digested pSLΔBglII/BamHI plasmid to generate pSLIQG-5. The pSLIQG-5 plasmid was then digested with BamHI and SacI, and a 1241-bp insert fragment was removed. The BamHI/SacI digest removed the region of IQGAP1 that encoded the IQ domain region (amino acids 747–862). To restore amino acids 447–746, PCR was used to amplify the cDNA encoding this region (see under “PCR Amplification of DNA”). The DNA primers used for this amplification introduced a BamHI site by creating a silent mutation in the codon for Glu-746 (GAA was changed to GAG) and contained a SacI site. The resulting PCR product was digested with BamHI and SacI, gel-purified, and then ligated into the purified pSLIQG-5 vector to generate pSLIQG1-ΔIQ. Finally, pSLIQG1-ΔIQ was digested with XhoI and XbaI, and the ∼6100-bp insert fragment was purified and ligated into the pFastBAC HT vector that had been digested with SalI and XbaI. The resulting plasmid (pFBIQG1-ΔIQ) was then used to generate baculovirus encoding IQGAP1ΔIQ (see under “Generation of IQGAP1-containing Baculovirus Particles”). To generate the IQGAP1-(2–522) protein fragment, we utilized a second plasmid given to us by Matt Hart, in which the IQGAP1-coding region had been N-terminally fused in-frame to the Myc epitope tag. In this plasmid the start codon was changed from ATG to GGA to create a BamHI site. Digestion of this plasmid with BamHI and HindIII generated a 1567-bp fragment that was ligated into the pRSET vector to generate pRSETIQG1-(2–522). This plasmid was then used to express recombinant protein in bacteria (see under “Expression and Purification of Proteins”). By using pBSIQG1-MH as a template and primers 5′-CCGCTCGAGATGTCCGCCGCAGACGAG-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CTCATCCATGGCATTCAACTGAAT-3′ (reverse primer), PCR was used to generate a DNA fragment that introduced an XhoI site 5′ to the start codon and to amplify the 5′ 365-bp coding region. Plasmid pBSIQG1-MH and primers 5′-CGGAGGTACCGACAGAGGAGAAAGGCC-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-GCTCTAGACTATCATTACTTCCCGTAGAACTT-3′ (reverse primer) were used to amplify 500 nucleotides from the 3′ end of IQGAP1 and to introduce 3 stop codons and an XbaI site 3′ to the coding region. Finally, to restore the region of IQGAP1 encoding amino acids 447–862, plasmid pSLIQG-2 and primers 5′-CACCCAGAGCTCTCTGTCGCAGTGGA-3′ (forward primer) and 5′-CGCGGATCCTCATTGGCCAGCCACAGCTG-3′ (reverse primer) were used to generate a DNA fragment that contained a SacI site at its 5′ end and introduced a BamHI site at its 3′ end by creating a silent mutation in the codon for Glu-746 (GAA was changed to GAG). All PCRs used the reagents and protocols of the Elongase Amplification System. The size of each PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and gel-purified. Baculoviruses expressing either IQGAP1FL or IQGAP1ΔIQ were generated following the procedures and protocols of the Bac-to-Bac HT expression system. Protein expression was verified by Western blotting and immunofluorescence using IQGAP1-specific antibodies. The virus titer was determined by the University of Virginia Tissue Culture Facility using the BacPAK Baculovirus Rapid Titer Kit. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle, as described previously (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and was stored as G-actin in small aliquots at −80 °C. When needed, G-actin was polymerized to generate actin filaments (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and stored on ice at 4 °C. Native IQGAP1 was purified from bovine adrenal glands by a modification of a method described previously (8.Joyal J.L. Annan R.S. Ho Y.-D. Huddleston M.E. Carr S.A. Hart M.J. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15419-15425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20–30 adrenal glands were harvested and placed in cold TES buffer: 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 300 mmsucrose, 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A. The glands were diced and homogenized, and the resulting slurry was then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (gmax = 16,374 × g) in a Sorval RC-5B centrifuge using the GSA rotor for 30 min. Supernatants were then centrifuged an additional 90 min at 40,000 rpm (gmax = 186,000 ×g) using the 45Ti rotor and a Beckman L8–80 ultracentrifuge. Next, the resulting supernatant was passed through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, and either snap-frozen for later use or applied to a calmodulin-Sepharose column. Freshly prepared or thawed supernatant was supplemented with NaCl to 150 mm and Triton X-100 to 1% before being applied to the column, which was equilibrated with TENT buffer (TES buffer lacking sucrose, but containing 150 mm NaCl and 1% Triton X-100). The flow-through was discarded; the column was then washed extensively with TEN buffer (TEN, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture containing 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin A) (TES lacking sucrose, but containing 150 mm NaCl), and bound protein was eluted with TENS buffer (TEN supplemented with 1 m NaSCN). Eluted fractions were monitored by immunoblotting for IQGAP1, and fractions containing IQGAP1 were pooled and concentrated using 30,000 molecular weight cut-off Amicon Centriprep concentrators following the manufacturer's protocol. The concentrated material was then placed into 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer dialysis cassettes, dialyzed extensively against TEN buffer, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant IQGAP1FL and IQGAP1ΔIQ were produced using the baculovirus expression system. Briefly, exponentially growing Sf9 cells were infected with appropriate viruses (multiplicity of infection of at least 3). Infected cultures were incubated on a orbital shaker at 27 °C for 48–60 h. The cultures were then centrifuged in a Sorval RC-5B centrifuge using the SLA-1500 rotor at 8,500 rpm (gmax = 10,976 × g) for 30 min. The pellets were then either lysed immediately or stored at −80 °C. To lyse cells, pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4 pH 8.0, 10 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and sonicated. Next, cell suspensions were centrifuged in a Sorval RC-5B centrifuge using SA-600 rotor at 10,500 rpm (gmax = 15,960 × g) for 30 min. The supernatant was then batch absorbed onto nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin that had been equilibrated previously with lysis buffer. The resin was then washed with several resin volumes of wash buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) followed by several washes with wash buffer B (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaSCN, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The bound material was then removed with elution buffer (50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The eluate was placed into 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes and dialyzed against several changes of dialysis buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). Finally, the protein was removed from the cassettes, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Recombinant IQGAP1-(2–522) was expressed in the BL21DE3 strain of Escherichia coli. 10 ml of overnight LB agar plates with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) cultures were inoculated with bacteria containing the pRSETIQG1-(2–522) plasmid from well isolated colonies. The next morning 1.0 liter of LB agar plates with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) cultures were inoculated from the overnight suspension and allowed to grow in an orbital shaker (300 rpm at 37 °C) until the A600 nm was 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.5 mm, followed by an additional 4-h incubation. The cultures were then centrifuged for 30 min at 8,000 rpm (gmax = 10,415 ×g) using the GSA rotor and a Sorval RC-5B centrifuge. The pellets were either resuspended in lysis buffer for purification or stored at −80 °C. After the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer, lysozyme was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. The suspension was then allowed to incubate for an additional hour on ice. After this point, the purification followed the protocol described above for the purification of IQGAP1FL and IQGAP1ΔIQ. Unless otherwise stated, recombinant IQGAP1 proteins were combined in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube with the stated reagents in TN buffer (TEN buffer lacking EGTA), and incubated for 30 min at 27 °C. F-actin was then added to the reaction mix. The sample was then either allowed to incubate at 27 °C for 30 min for actin pelleting assays or drawn into a 100-μl capillary tube followed by incubation for 30 min at 27 °C for falling ball viscometry. After the 30-min incubation, the actin pelleting samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 40,000 rpm (gmax = 87,000 ×g) using the Beckman Optima TLX ultracentrifuge and the TLA 100.3 rotor. The supernatant fraction was transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube, and the pellet was resuspended to volume with 1× loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. The samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), followed either by staining with GelCode Blue or by immunoblotting with anti-IQGAP1 antibodies. Falling ball viscometry and negative stain electron microscopy were performed as described earlier (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The polyclonal antibody to IQGAP1 was produced by immunizing a rabbit with IQGAP1-(2–522) and was used either as unfractionated diluted serum or as bulk IgG purified from serum using protein A-Sepharose beads. The IQGAP1 monoclonal IgG2a antibody was produced by footpad immunization of Balb/c mice with purified native bovine adrenal IQGAP1 and fusion of popliteal lymph node cells with NS-1 mouse plasmacytoma cells. The fusion and selection protocol was essentially identical to that used earlier for production of monoclonal antibodies to kinesin (23.Pfister K.K. Wagner M.C. Stenoien D.A. Brady S.T. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1453-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). With one modification, protocols described previously were also used for quantitation of GTP overlay blots (24.Bloom G.S. Richards B.W. Leopold P.L. Ritchey D.M. Brady S.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), gel electrophoresis (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and immunoblotting (5.Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The modification was to use a Umax (Freemont, CA) Astra 2200 scanner with a transparency adapter and 12-bit grayscale depth, instead of a CCD camera, to capture digital images of gels and chemiluminescent Western blots. Concentration series of the following purified proteins were used as standards for quantitation: native bovine adrenal IQGAP1, recombinant IQGAP1FL, recombinant IQGAP1ΔIQ, native bovine calmodulin, recombinant His6-Cdc42, and recombinant His6-Rac1. IQGAP1 was immunoprecipitated using the polyclonal IQGAP1 antiserum or IgG purified from the antiserum by protein A-Sepharose affinity chromatography. The antiserum or IgG was added to samples containing IQGAP1, and the resulting mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 27 °C. Next, protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for an additional hour at 27 °C. After their incubation, the samples were centrifuged for 5–10 s, and the supernatants were removed. The remaining resin was then washed several times with TN buffer. Finally, the beads were suspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. By using a pBSIQGAP1-2 template and the oligonucleotides, 5′-GTCGACTATGTCCGCCGCAGAC-3′ and 5′-CCCGGGGGTAGAACTTTTTGTT-3′, the entire IQGAP1 sequence was amplified by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR System. The size of the PCR product was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. The PCR fragment was then ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector to produce pGEM-IQGAP1. Finally the pGEM-IQGAP1 plasmid was sequentially digested with SalI and SmaI, and the IQGAP1 insert was ligated into a similarly digested pEYFP-N1 expression vector to produce pYFP-IQGAP1. NIH-3T3 fibroblasts were transiently transfected for IQGAP1-YFP expression using LipofectAMINE Plus according to the vendor's instructions (Invitrogen). The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin sulfate. Live transfected cells were observed and recorded by confocal epifluorescence microscopy on an imaging system containing the following components: a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope equipped with a CARV spinning disc confocal head, a temperature-regulated stage, automated shutter, an Atto Arc 100-watt mercury illuminator, and a Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, NJ) Orca-ER cooled CCD. Images captured by the camera were imported into a Power Macintosh G4 computer (Apple; Cupertino, CA) and processed and analyzed using Open Lab 3.0.3 software (Improvision; Lexington, MA). Cells were maintained on the microscope stage in Attofluor Cell Chambers (Atto Instruments; Rockville, MD) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air plus 5% CO2. Time lapse imaging was controlled by a program designed using the Automator feature of Open Lab. For Fig. 8 and the corresponding on-line QuickTime movies (see the Supplemental Material), Ca2+ addition was achieved by replacing the tissue culture medium with Ca2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented the Ca2+ ionophore, A23187, at 5 μm, plus 1 mm CaCl2. For Ca2+ removal, the solution bathing the cells was rep"

We have cultured gametocytes of Plasmodium berghei through to infectious sporozoites with efficiencies similar to those recorded in vivo and without the need for salivary gland invasion. Oocysts developed extracellularly in a system whose essential elements include co-cultured Drosophila S2 cells, basement membrane matrix, and insect tissue culture medium. Sporozoite production required the presence of para-aminobenzoic acid. The entire life cycle of P. berghei, a useful model malaria parasite, can now be achieved in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2075741568,"In Alzheimer's disease, microtubule-associated protein tau is hyperphosphorylated by an unknown mechanism and is aggregated into paired helical filaments. Hyperphosphorylation causes loss of tau function, microtubule instability, and neurodegeneration. Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) has been implicated in the phosphorylation of tau in normal and Alzheimer's disease brain. The molecular mechanism of GSK3β-tau interaction has not been clarified. In this study, we find that when microtubules are disassembled, microtubule-associated GSK3β dissociates from microtubules. From a gel filtration column, the dissociated GSK3β elutes as an ∼400-kDa complex. When fractions containing the ∼400-kDa complex are chromatographed through an anti-GSK3β immunoaffinity column, tau co-elutes with GSK3β. From fractions containing the ∼400-kDa complex, both tau and GSK3β co-immunoprecipitate with each other. GSK3β binds to nonphosphorylated tau, and the GSK3β-binding region is located within the N-terminal projection domain of tau. In vitro, GSK3β associates with microtubules only in the presence of tau. From brain extract, ∼6-fold more GSK3β co-immunoprecipitates with tau than GSK3α. These data indicate that, in brain, GSK3β is bound to tau within a ∼400-kDa microtubule-associated complex, and GSK3β associates with microtubules via tau.

Abnormal phosphorylation has been suggested to cause the loss of tau function, microtubule instability, and neurodegeneration in AD brain (1.Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C.

The identification of tau kinases and the elucidation of the mechanism of tau phosphorylation are essential to determine how tau becomes abnormally phosphorylated in AD brain.

Spillantini G. Jacks R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). On an SDS gel, tau isolated from brain extract displays several bands with sizes 50–68 kDa representing various tau isoforms with different phosphorylation states (5.Goedert M. Spillantini G.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12241-12245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In normal brain, tau binds to microtubules and stabilizes microtubule structure. Tau phosphorylation reduces the affinity of tau for microtubules, destabilizes microtubules, and regulates microtubule dynamics (1.Goedert M. Crowther R.A. Garner C.C.

Normal adult tau is phosphorylated on four sites, whereas juvenile tau is phosphorylated on 10 sites (8.Watanabe A. Hasegawa M. Suzuki M. Takio K. Morishima-Kawashima M. Titani K. Arai T. Kosik K.S. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25712-25717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PHF-tau on the other hand, is phosphorylated on 19 sites (9.Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Most of these sites are situated at an (S/T)P motif recognized by a proline-directed kinase. Among proline-directed kinases, MAP kinase, Cdc2 kinase, Cdk5, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) phosphorylate tau in vitro (2.Lee V.M.-Y. Goedert M. Trojanowski J.Q. Ann Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 24: 1121-1159Crossref Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). In addition, many non-proline-directed kinases such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), protein kinase C, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and phosphorylase kinase also phosphorylate tau in vitro (for a list of tau kinases, see Ref. 10.Hashiguchi M.

GSK3 is widely expressed in various mammalian tissues and cell lines (11.Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). It phosphorylates many proteins such as glycogen synthase, eukaryotic initiation factor 2B, ATP citrate lyase, the regulatory subunit of PKA, c-Jun, c-Myc, cAMP-response element-binding protein, inhibitor-2, β-catenin, neurofilaments, synapsin, and adenomatous polyposi coli gene product (12.Kim L.

These two isoforms are products of two distinct genes and are abundantly expressed in the brain (11.Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar). In vitro, GSK3β phosphorylates tau on Ser199, Thr231, Ser396, and Ser413(numbered according to the longest tau isoform) (23.Ishiguro K. Omori A. Takamatsu M. Sato K. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. Neurosci. Lett. 1992; 148: 202-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and these sites are phosphorylated in PHF-tau (9.Morishima-Kawashima M. Hasegawa M. Takio K. Suzuki M. Yoshida H. Titani K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 823-829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, co-transfection of tau with GSK3β leads to tau phosphorylation and microtubule rearrangement (24.Wagner U. Utton M. Gallo J.M. Miller C.J. J.

Transgenic mice overexpressing GSK3β display tau hyperphosphorylation, disrupted microtubules, and apoptotic neurons (26.Lucas J.J. Hernandez F. Gomez-Ramos P. Moran M.A. Hen R. Avila J.

The GSK3β inhibitor LiCl suppresses tau phosphorylation, enhances tau-microtubule binding, and promotes microtubule assembly in cultured neurons (28.Monz-Montano J.R. Moreno F.J. Avila J. Diaz-Nido J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 29.Hong M. Chen D.C.R. Klein P.S. Lee V.M.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). These in vivo observations indicate that GSK3β is a tau kinase and may be involved in pathological tau phosphorylation in AD brain. Ishiguro et al. isolated tau kinase 1 from bovine brain microtubules (30.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular cloning studies later determined that tau kinase 1 is GSK3β (31.Takashima A. Noguchi K. Sato K. Hoshino T. Imahori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1993; 90: 7789-7793Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have confirmed that GSK3β is tightly associated with neuronal microtubules (32.Mandelkow E.-M. Drewes G. Biernat J. Gustke N. Lint J.V. Vandenheede J.R. Mandelkow E. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). As discussed above, tau is a microtubule-associated protein and regulates microtubule dynamics by binding to microtubules and stabilizing microtubule structure (7.Hirokawa N. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 71-84Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar). These studies therefore suggest that GSK3β-tau interaction may occur within microtubules, and this interaction may be important in the regulation of microtubule dynamics. Elucidation of the biochemical nature of tau-GSK3β interaction may also provide a clue as to the cause of abnormal tau phosphorylation in AD brain. However, very little information is available about microtubule-associated GSK3β. In this study, we examined GSK3β within bovine brain microtubules. We now demonstrate that microtubule-associated GSK3β is a ∼400-kDa species complexed with tau. We also provide evidence for the binding of GSK3β to microtubules via tau. Pfu DNA polymerase-catalyzed PCR was carried out in a reaction mixture supplemented with 10% Me2SO by using a forward primer (5′-TCC CCC GGG ATG GGG CGG-3′) containing an SmaI site (italicized), a reverse primer (5′-CTC GAG TCA GGT GGA GTT GGA AGC-3′) containing an XhoI site (italicized), and a pBluescript plasmid template containing human brain GSK3β cDNA (a gift from Dr. J. R. Woodgett, University of Toronto). PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle of 94 °C for one min; 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min; and one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. Adenine overhangs were added to the PCR product by incubating the product with 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase at 72 °C for 10 min. The final PCR product was purified and ligated into a pGEX-T Easy TA vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and amplified. GSK3β cDNA was excised by SmaI/XhoI from the pGEX-T Easy TA vector and ligated into the SmaI/XhoI site of a pGEX-6P-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The recombinant plasmid was transfected into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells. The cloning was verified by DNA sequencing. Construction of various tau deletion mutant plasmids has been described previously (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GSK3β was purified from bacterial lysates. The overnight bacterial culture was diluted 20-fold in a fresh medium and incubated at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. After ∼4 h, protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside to 1 mm, and the incubation and shaking was continued for another 4 h. The incubated medium was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the pellet was suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) containing 1% Tween 20 and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mg/ml of benzamidine, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). The suspended pellet was sonicated twice for 30 s each and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed against lysis buffer for 4 h and then mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) previously equilibrated with lysis buffer. The beads were shaken end-over-end overnight and then packed in a glass column. The column was washed with ∼30 ml of lysis buffer and eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in lysis buffer. Fractions containing GST-GSK3β were combined, concentrated to ∼1 ml by dialysis against Aquacide III (Calbiochem), and dialyzed against lysis buffer at 4 °C. After dialyzing for 2 h, 10 units of precision protease (Sigma) were added, and the sample was incubated with end-over-end shaking at 4 °C for 16 h to remove the GST tag. The incubated sample was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose column preequilibrated in lysis buffer. GST remained bound to the column, whereas flow-through fractions containing GSK3β were combined and dialyzed against PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES (pH 6.8), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol) for 4 h at 4 °C and used to generate Fig. 7. Tubulin was purified from bovine brain microtubules through phosphocellulose chromatography (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purification of recombinant tau (R-tau) and R-tau deletion mutants has been described previously (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A polyclonal antibody against the C-terminal region of GSK3β (QTNNAASASASNSD) was prepared at Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against tau, GSK3β, GSK3α/β, and tubulin were from NeoMarker (Fremont, CA), Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and Sigma, respectively. A polyclonal anti-GSK3α antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Production of anti-tau polyclonal antibodies has been described previously (34.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of R-tau was determined spectrophotometrically (35.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Concentrations of R-tau deletion mutants and phosphorylated R-tau were determined by a Bio-Rad protein assay using R-tau as the standard. All other protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard. The concentration of GSK3 peptide substrate was based on amino acid analysis. Anti-GSK3β rabbit serum (∼0.5 ml) was diluted with an equal volume of coupling buffer (0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3), 0.5 m NaCl) and mixed with ∼3 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B gel (Amersham Biosciences) previously washed with 1 mm HCl and equilibrated in coupling buffer. The mixture was shaken end-over-end overnight at 4 °C. After shaking, the gel was recovered by centrifugation and washed with ∼20 ml of coupling buffer. The washed gel was blocked with 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature and washed with 0.1 mCH3COONa (pH 4.0), 0.5 m NaCl followed by 0.1m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl. The washed gel was then equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmDTT. A synthetic peptide (KRREILSRRPSYR), derived from the cAMP response element-binding protein that becomes a specific substrate for GSK3 upon PKA phosphorylation (18.Agarwal-Mawal A. Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23712-23718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), was synthesized at the peptide synthesis facility of the University of Calgary. This peptide was phosphorylated by PKA, and the phosphopeptide was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. Purified phosphopeptide was used to assay GSK3 activity. The assay was initiated by adding 10 μl of the sample to 20 μl of the reaction mixture containing the rest of the assay components. The final concentrations of various assay components were 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.3 mm[γ32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 μm PKA-phosphorylated peptide substrate. After 30 min at 30 °C, 10 μl of trichloroacetic acid was added to the assay mixture to stop the reaction, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Following incubation, the assay mixture was centrifuged for 5 min using a bench top centrifuge, and 20 μl of the supernatant was analyzed by phosphocellulose filter paper assay to determine the amount of radioactivity incorporated into the substrate peptide (34.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of GSK3 activity transfers 1 pmol of phosphate/min to substrate peptide under the above described standard assay conditions. Microtubule sedimentation assay was carried out as described previously (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Microtubules were assembled at 37 °C in an assay mixture (50 μl each) containing 0.1 m PIPES (pH 7.0), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mg/ml tubulin, 24 μm microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol (Sigma), and 1 mm GTP. When included, the concentrations of GSK3β, R-tau, and BSA were 10, 40, and 40 μg/ml, respectively. After mixing all of the assay components in various combinations, each mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 50,000 ×g for 5 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was withdrawn, and the pellet was dissolved in 30 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The pellet and the supernatant (15 μl each) were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were either immunoblotted using anti-GSK3β antibody or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. Microtubules were purified from a fresh bovine brain extract by three cycles of temperature-induced microtubule assembly and disassembly as described previously (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The purified microtubule preparation containing ∼5 mg/ml protein was incubated at 0 °C for 30 min to disassemble microtubules. The incubated sample was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant (∼25 ml) was loaded onto a phosphocellulose (Whatman, Fairfield, NJ) column (30 × 5 cm) preequilibrated in PEM buffer containing 0.1 mm GTP. Flow-through fractions contained tubulin, whereas GSK3 activity remained bound to the column. The column was washed with ∼75 ml of PEM buffer and eluted with 200 ml of a NaCl gradient (0–0.8 m) in PEM buffer. Fractions containing GSK3 activity were combined (∼50 ml) and dialyzed against Mops buffer (25 mm Mops (pH 7.4), 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). The dialyzed sample (labeled MAP-fraction in Figs. 6A and 9) was concentrated to ∼7 ml by dialysis against Aquacide III. The concentrated sample was dialyzed against Mops buffer for 2 h and centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was chromatographed through an FPLC Superose 12 (Amersham Biosciences) column (50 × 1.6 cm) equilibrated and eluted with Mops buffer. Effluent fractions containing GSK3 activity were combined (designated as the gel filtration fraction) and loaded onto an anti-GSK3β immunoaffinity column (1 × 10 cm) preequilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. The column was washed with 75 ml of equilibration buffer and eluted with 0.2 mglycine (pH 2.2). Fractions (0.5 ml each) were collected.Figure 9Co-immunoprecipitation of GSK3 α and GSK3 β with tau. Tau was immunoprecipitated (IP) from either MAP fraction or brain extract. Each resulting anti-tau immune complex was immunoblotted with an anti-GSK3α/β monoclonal antibody. A, immunoblot; B, GSK3β/GSK3α ratio. Blot A was scanned, and band intensity values were used to calculate the GSK3β/GSK3α ratio in the indicated samples as in Fig. 8B. Values are an average of three determinations ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The GST pull-down assay was performed essentially as described previously (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Glutathione-agarose beads (50 μl each) coated with GST or GST-GSK3β were mixed with 500 μl of tau solution (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.3 m sucrose, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.3% BSA, and 50 μg/ml of the indicated R-tau species) and incubated at 4 °C overnight with end-over-end shaking. Incubated beads were recovered by centrifugation and washed four times with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Washed beads were dissolved in 50 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, boiled, and centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was immunoblotted using an anti-tau antibody. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (36.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, gels were stained with either Coomassie Brilliant Blue or silver stain (Bio-Rad). Immunoblottings were carried out as described (34.Paudel H.K. Lew J. Ali Z. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23512-23518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by resolving samples on 10% SDS gels and using the indicated antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, samples (0.5 ml each) were precleared with 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) preequilibrated with 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.2 m NaCl and divided into two halves. To each half, 30 μl of either preimmune or indicated primary antiserum was added. Both halves were shaken end-over-end for 5 h at 4 °C. After shaking, 25 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added to each half, and shaking continued for another 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times for 30 min each with equilibration buffer. Washed beads were dissolved in 50 μl of sample buffer for SDS-PAGE, boiled, and centrifuged, and 20 μl of the supernatant was immunoblotted using the indicated antibody. Band intensities were quantitated by scanning blots as described (35.Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28328-28334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In a previous study, ammonium sulfate precipitation was utilized during purification of GSK3β from microtubule fraction (30.Ishiguro K. Takamatsu M. Tomizawa K. Omori A. Takahashi M. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10897-10901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This treatment can dissociate a protein complex (33.Sobue K. Agarwal-Mawal A. Li W. Sun W. Miura Y Paudel H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16673-16680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We therefore excluded the ammonium sulfate precipitation step in our purification procedure and dissembled purified microtubules by incubating them at 0 °C for 30 min. Disassembled microtubules were then chromatographed through a phosphocellulose column. Tubulin was recovered within the flow-through fractions, and column-bound GSK3β was eluted with a NaCl gradient (data not shown). Effluent MAP fraction-containing GSK3β was analyzed by an FPLC Superose 12 gel filtration column (Fig. 1A). The activity assay (Fig. 1A) and immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1B) showed that GSK3β elutes as a relatively large species from the gel filtration column. The size of GSK3β in Fig. 1A (fraction 52) was estimated to be ∼400 kDa. Since GSK3β is a globular protein with size ∼47 kDa (11.Woodgett J.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), our data indicate that microtubule-associated GSK3β is part of a ∼400-kDa complex. To identify the protein complexed with microtubule-associated GSK3β, we analyzed various gel filtration column fractions in Fig. 1A by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against MAP1, MAP2, tau, and tubulin (data not shown).

A protein-stained SDS gel (Fig. 1C) showed many protein bands with various sizes in fractions enriched with GSK3β (fractions 44–64). Since the above described SDS gel (Fig. 1C) and immunoblots did not give us any indication as to the identification of protein(s) complexed with GSK3β in the microtubule fraction, we combined fractions 44–64 from Fig. 1A (designated as the gel filtration fraction) and chromatographed the gel filtration fraction through an anti-GSK3β immunoaffinity column. A silver-stained SDS gel showed a prominent band and three or four faint bands (Fig. 2A) in fraction 5 (the peak effluent fraction). The major ∼47-kDa band was identified as GSK3β by immunoblot analysis using anti-GSK3β antibody (data not shown). Faint protein bands migrated with sizes ∼50–68 kDa on an SDS gel. Since the various tau isoforms also migrate as ∼50–68-kDa bands on a SDS gel (5.Goedert M. Spillantini G. Jacks R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A.

This involves a highly coordinated process of differentiation in which the Notch signaling pathway and the system of helix-loop-helix (HLH) transcriptional regulators play a key role. By exercising control over proliferation, initiation of differentiation, neurite outgrowth, and synaptogenesis, the network of HLH transcription factors regulates the fate of neural stem cells and progenitors. Here we show that the HLH transcription factor HES1 regulates the proliferation of human neural stem cells and that blocking its expression stimulates the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the suppression of HES1 expression initiates differentiation of neural stem cells into neurons, the majority of which develop the GABAergic phenotype.

Also, differentiation of neural stem cells is affected by Notch signaling and expression of HES transcriptional regulators. Activation of Notch leads to glial differentiation and blocking of neuronal differentiation (19Gaiano N. Nye J.S. Fishell G.

Neurosci. 2001; 17: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Since HES1 is part of the network of HLH transcription factors, its expression and activity likely affects differentiation of specific cell types. Here we asked two specific questions: first, how does HES affect differentiation of specific types of neurons and second, what is the mechanism of action of HES on neural stem cell proliferation. We demonstrate that blocking HES1 in human neural stem cells in vitro stimulates differentiation of GABAergic neurons and suppresses stem cell proliferation by stimulation of expression of cyclin-dependent Cdk kinase inhibitor p21CIP1/WAF1. Resected human fetal brain tissue was placed into ice cold DMEM/F-12 with penicillin/streptomycin for further dissection. The tissue was cut into small pieces and trypsinized (0.02 mg/ml trypsin in versene (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 10 min. After adding trypsin inhibitor mixture (Clonetics) tissue was mechanically triturated. Cell suspension was centrifuged at 400 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was washed once with DMEM/F-12 and plated at a density of 5000–10,000 viable cells/ml in the growth medium DMEM/F-12, B27 supplement (Invitrogen), 20 ng/ml of human LIF (PeproTech), 20 ng/ml of human basic fibroblast growth factor (PeproTech), penicillin/streptomycin). Stem cells were grown as neurospheres, medium changed every 3 days, spheres dissociated by mechanical trituration after every 12–15 days. Neurospheres were mechanically dissociated and plated on laminin-coated (30 μl/1 ml of PBS, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 24-well plates in differentiating medium (DMEM/F-12, B27 supplement, all-trans-retinoic acid (10−6m) and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP, 1 mm)). S-Oligonucleotides (phosphothioates) (Sigma Genosys) with following sequences were used: anti-Hes1-1, 5′-ACC GGG GAC GAG GAA TTT TTC; anti-Hes 1-2, 5′-CAC GGA GGT GCC GCT GTT GCT GGT GTA GAC GGG GAT GAC; control S-oligonucleotide contained a scrambled sequence 5′-TCG GAG ACT TTC TGT CGG GCT GAT CGG TCG GGC TGG GGA G. Oligonucleotides were added to the growth or differentiation culture media at a final concentration of 5 μm. The medium with the oligonucleotides was replaced every day during the experiment. For antisense oligonucleotide treatment of neurospheres the cells (neurospheres) were transferred into 24-well plates in growth media containing antisense or scrambled oligonucleotides for 4 days. For further analyses the cells were either plated onto poly-d-lysine coated 24-well plates or centrifuged onto glass slides and fixed in cold acetone/methanol for 2 min. To treat differentiating cells neurospheres were mechanically dissociated and plated on laminin-coated (30 μl/1 ml of PBS, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) 24-well plates in differentiating medium (DMEM/F-12, B27 supplement, all-trans-retinoic acid (10−6m) and Bt2cAMP (1 mm)). Antisense or scrambled oligonucleotides were added to the differentiation media for 4 days after which the cells were used for further analyses. Cells were washed with PBS (Invitrogen) and fixed for 2 min in cold acetone/methanol. After a wash in PBS, they were blocked for 30 min in 4% donkey serum. Primary antibodies against β-III-tubulin (1:100, mouse monoclonal, Chemicon); MAP-2 (1:100, mouse monoclonal, Chemicon); GFAP (undiluted, rabbit monoclonal, Roche Molecular Biochemicals); BrdUrd (1:100, mouse monoclonal, Dako); Ash1 (1:200, rabbit polyclonal CeMines), anti-Hes1 (1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, CeMines), anti-p21CIP1/WAF1 (1:100, NeoMarkers), anti-p27KIP1 (1:100, NeoMarkers), and GAD65&67 (1:100, rabbit polyclonal, Chemicon) were applied for 90 min. Than the cells were washed in PBS and incubated in Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies for 30 min (Chemicon), washed in PBS, and examined under a fluorescent microscope. The cells were counterstained with DAPI (Dako) to identify nuclei. Cells were washed with PBS, collected, and resuspended in Laemli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, 50 μl/1 ml of sample buffer). Samples were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred onto a Hybond membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Membrane was blocked for 2 h (5% solution of dry milk and PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), washed with PBS/Tween, and incubated in primary antibody (anti-Hes1, 1:1000, rabbit polyclonal, CeMines) overnight. After washing in PBS/Tween the membrane was incubated for 30 min in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoreactivity was detected with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and fluorography. Expression of HES1 is detectable in human neural stem cells both at the mRNA (24Palm K. Salin-Nordstrom T. Levesque M.F. Neuman T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and protein level (Fig. 1). We used antisenseS-oligonucleotides (phosphothioates) to block HES1 expression in neural stem cells. Immunohistochemical and Western blot (Fig. 1) analyses results clearly demonstrate that incubation of differentiating neural stem cells with antisense oligonucleotides (5 μm) blocks HES1 protein expression. Blocking HES1 in differentiating stem cells treated with retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP for 4 days results in massive differentiation of stem cells into β-III-tubulin and MAP2 positive cells (Fig.2, C and D). In control cultures 5–15% of cells differentiate into neuronal cells after 3 days, whereas in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures ∼80–90% of cells differentiate into neuronal cells that express β-III-tubulin and MAP2. Simultaneously, the number of GFAP expressing cells as well as the intensity of GFAP immunostaining was significantly reduced (Fig. 2, E and F).Figure 2Blocking HES1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides induces neuronal and suppress glial differentiation of human neural stem cells in vitro. Control oligonucleotide-treated cultures of neural stem cells differentiate into cells with glial and neuronal morphology (A), while a small number of cells express neuronal marker β-III-tubulin (C) and the majority of cells are stained for astroglial marker GFAP (E). Majority of antisense HES1 oligonucleotide-treated cells differentiate into bipolar cells (B) and express β-III-tubulin (D), whereas expression of GFAP was almost undetectable (F). A small number of cells in control oligonucleotide-treated cultures express GAD, a marker of GABAergic neurons (G), while GAD is expressed in the majority of cells in HES1 antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures (H).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since the network of HLH transcription factors regulates the fate of neuronal populations and blocking HES1 expression likely affects the ratios of different HLH transcription factor complexes, we analyzed the neurotransmitter phenotype of differentiating neurons. Immunohistochemical analyses using antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD, marker for GABAergic neurons) demonstrated that the majority of neural cells that differentiate after blocking HES1 express GAD, suggesting that suppression of HES1 and treatment of cells with retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP results in GABAergic differentiation. In control cultures 1–15% of neural cells express GAD after 5 days, whereas in antisense HES1-treated cultures 50–95% of neuronal cells become GABAergic (Fig. 2, G andH; Table I). Analyses of expression of choline acetyltransferase, a marker for cholinergic differentiation, did not show a difference between control and antisense HES-treated cultures.Table ISuppression of HES1 in differentiating human neural stem cells induces differentiation of GABAergic neuronsCloneUntreatedHES1 antisense treated% neurons% GAD + cells% neurons% GAD + cellsH13 ± 0.515 ± 387 ± 595 ± 6H210 ± 39 ± 279 ± 682 ± 6C14 ± 11 ± 181 ± 452 ± 7Human neural stem cells were differentiated in the presence of dBcAMP and all-trans-RA for 5 days.

HES1 expression was inhibited using antisense S-oligonucleotides, and neuronal phenotype was analyzed using antibodies against β-III-tubulin (marker for neurons) and GAD (marker for GABAergic neurons). The next question we asked was, does the blocking of HES1 affects proliferation and initiation of differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro. Some data indicate that blocking HES1 in vivo results in premature differentiation of precursors into neurons (16Ishibashi M. Ang S.-L. Shiota K. Nakanishi S. Kageyama R. Guillemot F. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3136-3148Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 18Ohtsuka T. Sakamoto M. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30467-30474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and reduction in the number of neurons in the nervous system (17Nakamura Y. Sakakibara S. Miyata T. Ogawa M. Shimazaki T. Weiss S. Kageyama R. Okano H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 283-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of HES1 expression on proliferation and initiation of differentiation of neural stem cells in vitro, we blocked HES1 expression using antisense oligonucleotides in proliferating stem cells that grow as neurospheres. Neurospheres were grown in the presence of antisense oligonucleotides for 4 days, and for the last 20 h BrdUrd was added to label cells that synthesize DNA. Comparison of BrdUrd incorporation in control and antisense HES1-treated cultures showed that blocking HES1 results in significant reduction (more than 2-fold) of DNA synthesis. In control cultures 75 ± 5% of cells synthesize DNA (Fig.3, A and B), whereas in antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures the ratio of proliferating cells is reduced to 34 ± 4% (Fig. 3, Cand D). These data are also supported by propidium iodide staining of DNA in antisense and control oligonucleotide-treated neurospheres and cell cycle analyses using flow cytometry (data not shown). We also analyzed differentiation of stem cells grown in neurospheres in the presence of antisense HES1 oligonucleotides. Differentiation of these cells was initiated by plating them onto laminin-coated surface in the presence of retinoic acid and Bt2cAMP. These experiments show how blocking of HES1 expression affects the commitment and not the differentiation phase of neural stem cell development. In control cultures that were differentiated 4 and 7 days 5–15% and 23–25% of cells express β-III-tubulin, respectively. In antisense oligonucleotide-treated cultures 27–30% and 40–45% of cells express β-III-tubulin after 4 and 7 days, respectively. Since blocking HES1 likely stimulates early molecular events of neuronal differentiation, we analyzed expression of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor ASH1 in neurospheres. In control neurospheres 42 ± 6% of cells express ASH1, whereas treatment of cells for 4 days with antisense oligonucleotides doubles the number of ASH1 positive cells (95 ± 6%) (data not shown). One potential mechanism of how blocking HES1 could affect cell proliferation is by inducing Cdk inhibitors. We used immunocytochemical staining of p16INK4a, p21CIP1/WAF1, p27KIP1, and p57KIP2in control and antisense HES1 oligonucleotide-treated cells to validate this hypothesis. We were unable to detect expression of p16INK4a and p57KIP2 using immunocytochemical techniques in human neural stem cells. Blocking expression of HES1 in growing neurospheres for 4 days results in significant stimulation of p21CIP1/WAF1 expression. In control neural stem cell cultures 24 ± 7% of cells show nuclear staining of p21CIP1/WAF1. Blocking of HES1 expression with antisense oligonucleotides for 4 days increases the number of cells that have nuclear staining of p21CIP1/WAF1 to 50 ± 5% (Fig. 3,E–H). Expression of p27KIP1 was not changed in neurospheres treated with antisense HES1 oligonucleotides. Contrary to neurosphere cultures, the ratio of p27KIP1-expressing cells in cultures that were treated with antisense HES1 oligonucleotides during differentiation doubled. Approximately 30 ± 5% of cells show nuclear staining in differentiated control cultures, whereas in antisense HES1-treated cultures p27KIP1 is present in 60 ± 4% of nuclei. Immunostaining results also demonstrate that p27KIP1 is localized in the nuclei of neurons and not in glial cells (Fig. 4). Since the number of neurons is higher in antisense HES1-treated cultures compared with controls then the increase of the number of p27KIP1-expressing cells is a reflection of changed ratio of neurons and glial cells. Human neural stem cells differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes when plated on supportive substrate and upon removal of growth factors such as EGF and basic fibroblast growth factor. The ratios of neurons and glial cells among differentiated cells vary depending on the stem cell isolate. On average, 2–15% of the cells differentiate into neurons and the rest develop into glial cells, whereas the majority, more than 80%, are astrocytes and less than 20% oligodendrocytes. Recently it has been reported that astroglial development requires the expression of HES transcription factors and that suppression of their expression results in premature neuronal differentiation (17Nakamura Y.

Salin-Nordstrom T. Levesque M.F. Neuman T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 78: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) show that HES1 is highly expressed in human neural stem cells grown as neurospheres in vitro. Here we tested the hypothesis that blocking HES1 expression in human neural stem cells stimulates specific neuronal differentiation and blocks proliferation of neural stem cells. We used two different experimental conditions to answer these questions. First, we blocked HES1 in differentiating neural stem cells that grow as a monolayer on laminin-coated surface in the absence of growth factors and presence of retinoic acid and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Second, we analyzed the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells that were grown as neurospeheres during the blocking of HES1 expression. Our results demonstrate that blocking HES1 expression affects two different stages of neuronal differentiation: selection of neuronal versus glial development and differentiation of specific neuronal phenotype, GABAergic neurons. Presence and activity of HLH transcription factors determines development of neuronal lineage (8Lee S.-K. Pfaff S.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 9Nieto M. Schuurmans C. Britz O. Guillemot F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Overexpression of HES generates more neurons, whereas a lack of HES activity results in premature differentiation and lower than normal number of neurons in the developing nervous system. In contrast, overexpression of proneuronal genes from the neurogenin and ash family is essential for the development of neuronal cells and inhibition of glial differentiation (for review, see Ref. 10Vetter M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HES1 as a negative regulator inhibits the activity of HLH transcription factors, which results in blocking of neuronal differentiation and either differentiation into glial lineage or continuing proliferation. Glial differentiation occurs only if appropriate signals such as CNTF and LIF (26Bonni A. Sun Y. Nadal-Vicens M. Bhatt A. Frank D.A. Rozovsky I. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 278: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar) are present. The precise molecular mechanisms of action of HLH transcription factors, including the balance of positive and negative factors, has to be elucidated. Even less is known about the choices of specific neuronal differentiation pathways. Some data indicate that a set of specific HLH transcription factors determines the fate of progenitor cells (9Nieto M. Schuurmans C. Britz O. Guillemot F. Neuron. 2001; 29: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, 10Vetter M. Neuron. 2001; 29: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). HES1 as a negative regulator likely changes this delicate balance and drives progenitors into a specific type of neurons. We demonstrate that the blocking of HES1 expression induces the differentiation of neural stem cells into GABAergic neurons, and this may indicate that GABAergic differentiation is a default pathway for neuronal precursors."

It is overexpressed in breast, esophageal, and gastric cancers, and may contribute to the invasive potential of cancer cells. Molecular interactions involving Grb7 therefore provide attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. We have utilized phage display random peptide libraries as a source of small peptide ligands to the SH2 domain of Grb7. Screening these libraries against purified Grb7 SH2 resulted in the identification of Grb7-binding peptide phage clones that contained a non-phosphorylated Tyr-X-Asn (Y XN) motif. The tyrosine-phosphorylated form of this motif is characteristic of Grb7 SH2 domain binding sites identified in RTKs and other signaling proteins such as Shc. Peptides that are non-phosphorylated have greater potential in the development of therapeutics because of the instability of a phosphate group in vivo. Using a biased library approach with this conserved Y XN motif, we identified seven different peptide phage clones, which bind specifically to the SH2 domain of Grb7. These peptides did not bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (which also selects for Asn at pY+2) or Grb14, a closely related family member. The cyclic structure of the peptides was required to bind to the Grb7 SH2 domain. Importantly, the synthetic Grb7-binding peptide G7-18 in cell lysates was able to specifically inhibit the association of Grb7 with the ErbB family of RTKs, in particular ErbB3, in a dose-dependent manner. These peptides will be useful in the development of targeted molecular therapeutics for cancers overexpressing Grb7 and in the development of Grb7-specific inhibitors to gain a complete understanding of the physiological role of Grb7.

These peptides did not bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (which also selects for Asn at pY+2) or Grb14, a closely related family member. The cyclic structure of the peptides was required to bind to the Grb7 SH2 domain. Importantly, the synthetic Grb7-binding peptide G7-18 in cell lysates was able to specifically inhibit the association of Grb7 with the ErbB family of RTKs, in particular ErbB3, in a dose-dependent manner. These peptides will be useful in the development of targeted molecular therapeutics for cancers overexpressing Grb7 and in the development of Grb7-specific inhibitors to gain a complete understanding of the physiological role of Grb7. SH2 domains are found in a large number of proteins and mediate signal transduction pathways associated with tyrosine kinase activity by binding to specific phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins. These domains, ∼100 amino acids long, serve a critical role by transmitting signals within a cell, act as adapters between receptors and downstream signaling molecules, and regulate the kinase activity of specific proteins (1.Pawson T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 87-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These domains are attractive targets for developing targeted therapeutics, especially in the area of oncology and immunology. Our laboratory was the first to identify a non-phosphorylated ligand to the SH2 domain of Grb2 (3.Oligino L. Lung F.D. Sastry L. Bigelow J. Cao T. Curran M. Burke Jr., T.R. Wang S. Krag D.

Our interests are to target SH2 domain proteins that play a role in signaling by the ErbB tyrosine kinase family of receptors, which comprises EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4. Grb7 is an especially promising cancer target because the encoding gene maps closely to the ErbB2 gene and is found co-amplified in a subset of breast cancers (12.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K. Margolis B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1331-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In addition, Grb7 is overexpressed with ErbB2 in breast, esophageal, and gastric cancers (12.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Osborne C.K.

The importance of ErbB2 in breast cancer is well established. ErbB2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is 1) overexpressed on the tumor cells of ∼30% of breast cancer patients and in more than half of in situ ductal carcinomas, which suggests that ErbB2 overexpression may be an important initiating event in breast cancer; 2) associated with poor prognosis; and 3) found only minimally on normal cells (15.Gullick W.J.

In addition, co-expression of Grb7 with ErbB2 was detected in 31% of esophageal carcinomas and was significantly correlated with extramucosal tumor invasion (14.Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 28-31PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Grb7 is co-expressed with ErbB3 and ErbB4, which are known to heterodimerize with ErbB2, in a subgroup of human breast cancer cell lines (22.Fiddes R.J. Campbell D.H. Janes P.W.

The SH2 domain of Grb7 binds to an intracellular phosphorylated tyrosine residue of ErbB2 as well as to specific phosphotyrosines of other receptors such as ErbB3 (22.Fiddes R.J. Campbell D.H.

The Grb7 SH2 domain also binds to the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHPTP2 (28.Keegan K. Cooper J.A. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1537-1544PubMed Google Scholar) and the adapter protein SHC (12.Stein D. Wu J.

The functional consequences of the association of Grb7 with its physiological ligands have not been completely elucidated. However, the importance of Grb7 in tumor progression has been suggested by several studies (14.Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 28-31PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 29.Tanaka S. Mori M.

Wands J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In one recent study, histologic expression of Grb7 in primary squamous cell esophageal tumors at the time of surgical resection showed Grb7 to be overexpressed in 14 of 31 esophageal carcinomas as compared with adjacent normal mucosa. The overexpression of Grb7 in these histological sections was significantly correlated with the presence of lymph node metastases (30.Tanaka S. Sugimachi K. Kawaguchi H. Saeki H. Ohno S. Wands J.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In another study, inducible Grb7 overexpression in NIH3T3 cells increased cell migration toward fibronectin, whereas overexpression of its SH2 domain inhibited cell migration (24.Han D.C. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24425-24430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Likewise, overexpression of Grb7, and not a Grb7 mutant where the SH2 and GM domains were eliminated, stimulated cell migration in CHO cells (31.Han D.C. Shen T.L. Guan J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28911-28917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an esophageal cancer line, down-regulation of Grb7 using antisense technology inhibited the invasive properties of the cells (29.Tanaka S. Mori M. Akiyoshi T. Tanaka Y. Mafune K. Wands J.R. Sugimachi K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Another promising feature of Grb7 as a tumor target is its limited tissue distribution, which is unlike that of many other SH2 domain-containing proteins which are ubiquitously expressed (2.Margolis B. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1994; 62: 223-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Having limited tissue distribution is advantageous for targeting therapeutics to cancer cells. The fact that Grb7 is associated with tumor-related molecules and has been demonstrated to have a direct role in cancer cell migration makes it a potentially important therapeutic target. Phage display libraries have been used extensively to identify peptide ligands for a variety of molecular targets (32.Zwick M.B. Shen J. Scott J.K. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33.Scott J.K. Craig L. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 34.Nilsson F. Tarli L. Viti F. Neri D. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2000; 43: 165-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These libraries are an abundant source of potential small ligands to tumor targets and other macromolecules. Even though a variety of systems have been developed, the most common phage display system expresses the fusion protein on the minor coat protein, pIII (35.Smith G.P. Science. 1985; 228: 1315-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (3151) Google Scholar), or the major coat protein, pVIII (36.Markland W. Roberts B.L. Saxena M.J. Guterman S.K. Ladner R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 109: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are many small peptides that have proven to be useful in tumor targeting and anti-cancer therapies, such as those that specifically bind to the vasculature of tumors in vivo and deliver cytotoxic agents specifically to tumor cells (37.Arap W. Pasqualini R. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1998; 279: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (1873) Google Scholar); 2) specifically bind and regulate estrogen receptor α transcriptional activity, which can be used in the development of novel treatments for tamoxifen-refractory breast cancers (38.Norris J.D. Paige L.A. Christensen D.J. Chang C.Y. Huacani M.R. Fan D. Hamilton P.T. Fowlkes D.M. McDonnell D.P. Science. 1999; 285: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar); and 3) specifically bind to type IV collagenase/gelatinase matrix metalloproteinases and inhibit the migration of human endothelial cells and tumor cells, which may prove useful in tumor targeting and anti-cancer therapies (39.Koivunen E. Arap W. Valtanen H. Rainisalo A. Medina O.P. Heikkila P. Kantor C. Gahmberg C.G. Salo T. Konttinen Y.T. Sorsa T. Ruoslahti E. Pasqualini R. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Peptides identified from phage display libraries can be modified, if necessary, to obtain an intracellularly stable, cell permeable, and higher affinity peptide that maintains specific binding to its target. These modifications can be achieved utilizing a homologous-analog and/or peptidomimetics approach to confer desirable pharmaceutical properties of stability, affinity, and specificity (40.Burke Jr., T.R.

In addition, a structure-based approach can be used for optimization of the targeting properties of a peptide, such as affinity, by studying the peptide or the peptide complexed to its target (4.Furet P.

Using phage display, we have identified the first non-phosphorylated peptides that are highly selective for the Grb7 SH2 domain compared with Grb2 or Grb14 SH2 domains. In addition, one of the Grb7-binding peptides is able to effectively block Grb7 from binding to the ErbB family of RTKs. 1The abbreviations used are: RTKsreceptor tyrosine kinasesGSTglutathione S-transferaseELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayFmocN-(9 fluorenyl)methoxycarbonylpYphosphotyrosineNAno armsSOC2% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm glucoseNNKa cloning scheme in which N represents equal amounts of G, A, T, or C and K represents equal amounts of G or T These Grb7-binding peptides will be further evaluated as lead compounds for drugs that target diseases where Grb7 is overexpressed and may provide useful tools for the elucidation of Grb7 function. receptor tyrosine kinases glutathione S-transferase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay N-(9 fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl phosphotyrosine no arms 2% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl, 10 mm MgSO4, and 20 mm glucose a cloning scheme in which N represents equal amounts of G, A, T, or C and K represents equal amounts of G or T The peptide libraries used in these studies were constructed in the fUSE5 gene III phage display system (51.Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The fUSE5 vector and Escherichia coli host strains (K91 Kan and MC1061F′) were the generous gift of Dr. George Smith at the University of Missouri (51.Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The half-site cloning method used by Cwirla et al. (52.Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar) was employed in construction of these libraries. The two half-site oligos 5′-TCCGCCAGCCCCGT-3′ (GS5′) and 5′-CGGCCCCGCCTCC-3′(GS3′) are complementary to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the peptide insert-encoding oligonucleotide. The random peptide encoding oligonucleotide has the following sequence: 5′pGGGCTGGCGGA(NNK)4TGC(NNK)10TGC(NNK)4GGAGGCGGGGCCGCTG 3′ (referred to as ON-10). The Y XN-biased peptide encoding oligonucleotide has the following sequence: GGGCTGGCGGA(NNK)4TGC(NNK)4TAYEFJAAY(NNK)3TGC(NNK)4GGAGGCGGGGCCGCTG (referred to as ON-Y XN) where N refers to equal amounts of G, A, T or C; K refers to equal amounts of G or T; Y refers to equal amounts of T and C; E refers to 62.5% G, 12.5% A, 12.5% C, and 12.5% T; F refers to 37.5% A, 37.5% C, 12.5% G, and 12.5% T; and J refers to 37.5% G, 37.5% T, 12.5% A, and 12.5% C. Oligos GS5′, GS3′, and ON-10 were synthesized by the University of Vermont Molecular Genetics Oligo Synthesis Facility, and the Y XN-biased oligonucleotide by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, Texas). The annealing reaction for the random library was carried out by mixing 219 pmol of GS5′, 219pmol GS3′, and 10.96 pmol of ON-10. The annealing reaction for the Y XN-biased library contained 144 pmol of GS5′, 144 pmol of GS3′, and 7.5 pmol of ON-YXN. After the annealing reactions were carried out to generate double-stranded termini, the non-annealed single stranded half-site oligos were removed using QIAquick Clean-up Kit (Qiagen), eluting in 36 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. The SfiI-digested fUSE5 phage vector (13.7 μg for the random peptide library and 15 μg for the Y XN-biased library) were ligated to the annealed oligos in a 1-ml reaction containing T4 DNA Ligase (Invitrogen) (1 unit/μg of vector) overnight at 15 °C followed by heat inactivation at 65 °C for 10 min. The ligation reactions were ethanol-precipitated with pellet paint co-precipitant (Novagen) for 3 h at −20 °C, resuspended in 60 μl of water, and heated at 50 °C for 5 min to thoroughly dissolve the DNA. The ligations were transformed into freshly prepared electrocompetent E. coli (MC1061F′) cells. Sixty electrotransformations, each containing 40 μl of cells, were performed at 1.7 kV. After transformation, the cells were collected in 2 ml of SOC medium and grown for an hour at 37 °C, 220 rpm. After the hour of non-selective growth, all transformation reactions were pooled, centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min, and resuspended in 10 ml of SOC medium. An aliquot of the transformations was plated onto an LB/tetracycline plate to determine the original number of transformants. The pools of transformants were plated on Pyrex dishes (11 × 7 inches) containing 2× YT/tetracycline/ streptomycin (1 ml per dish). The dishes were incubated at 37 °C overnight to allow and produce thousands of copies of each peptide phage particle library member. The SH2 domain constructs for Grb7, Grb14, Grb7 βD5/βD6, and Grb2 were provided by Dr. Roger Daly. The construction of these plasmids have been described by Janes et al. (53.Janes P.W. Lackmann M.

These proteins were expressed in a GST fusion bacterial expression system using the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and purified from isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced bacterial cultures as described previously (55.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). Purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was determined by Bradford-based protein assay (Bio-Rad). The libraries were amplified so that there were ∼1000 transforming units of each peptide phage representing 200 library equivalents. The amplified phage were infected into K91/Kan cells, plated onto five 2× YT agar dishes (11 × 7 inches) containing 40 μg/ml tetracycline, incubated overnight at 30 °C, and harvested in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with a prokaryotic protease inhibitor mixture (1:1000)(Sigma) by sweeping the bacteria off the agar with a bent glass rod. The bacterial cell suspension was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-μm polyethersulfone (PES) filter. The filtrate was incubated for 30 min on ice with 0.15 volume of polyethylene glycol/NaCl to precipitate the phage and centrifuged at 9000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C. The phage pellet was resuspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline with a prokaryotic protease inhibitor mixture. GST-binding peptide phage were subtracted from the library by preincubation of the library with 2 μg of GST immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The phage were screened by adding them to 12 μg of purified GST·Grb7 SH2 immobilized onto 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose and incubated for 2 h on a nutator at 25 °C. The unbound phage were removed by washing five times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline with a prokaryotic protease inhibitor mixture. Phage binders were eluted twice with a low pH (2.3) buffer followed by two elutions with a high pH (12.Stein D. Wu J. Fuqua S.A. Roonprapunt C. Yajnik V. D'Eustachio P. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M.

K91/Kan cells were then infected with the pooled phage elutions, and a small aliquot was plated to determine the total amount of phage particles bound to the targets. The remaining phage were amplified overnight, harvested, screened, and eluted as described above. To determine the amount of enrichment after the second and third rounds of panning, half of the pre-cleared phage were added to fresh GST immobilized on glutathione beads to determine the amount of phage binding GST-glutathione-Sepharose compared with GST·Grb7 SH2 glutathione-Sepharose. Three rounds of screening were carried out before clones were sequenced or tested in an ELISA. Isolated peptide phage-infected E. coli colonies were grown in 5 ml of LB/tetracycline broth. The double-stranded phage replicative form DNA was isolated using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). The following sequencing primer designed by George Smith was used to sequence the random insert in the fUSE5 vector: 5′-CCC TCA TAG TTA GCG TAA CG-3′ (51.Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). The sequence reactions were carried out using BigDye Version 1 Dye Terminator kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequencing reactions and automated DNA sequencing were performed in the Vermont Cancer Center DNA Analysis Facility. The amino acid sequences of peptides displayed by peptide phage were deduced from the DNA sequence of the corresponding phage clones. Consensus sequence identification was performed by visual inspection and with the ClustalW alignment program. A reverse phage ELISA was used to evaluate the ability of individual phage clones to bind to Grb7 SH2 (32.Zwick M.B. Shen J. Scott J.K. Curr. Opin.

Briefly, protein targets (5 μg/ml) were added to a 96-well Maxisorp plate (Nunc) plate precoated with anti-GST polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml final concentration) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and blocked with casein in Tris-buffered saline (Pierce). The peptide phage were concentrated with polyethylene glycol/NaCl precipitation methods (51.Scott J.K. Smith G.P. Science. 1990; 249: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar), added to each well (1 × 107−1 × 108 phage/well), and incubated for 2 h. at room temperature. Unbound phage were removed with 0.1% Tween-Tris-buffered saline buffer, and phage were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-M13 monoclonal antibody (1:1000) (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) substrate (Calbiochem).

This down-regulation occurs on a posttranslational level; it is not accompanied by changes in LPL mRNA or protein levels. The LPL activity can be restored within 4 h by refeeding. Previously, we showed that during fasting there is a shift in the distribution of lipase protein toward an inactive form with low heparin affinity. To study the nature of the regulatory mechanism, we determined the <i>in vivo</i> turnover of LPL activity, protein mass, and mRNA in rat adipose tissue. When protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide, LPL activity and protein mass decreased rapidly and in parallel with half-lives of around 2 h, and the effect of refeeding was blocked. This indicates that maintaining high levels of LPL activity requires continuous synthesis of new enzyme protein. When transcription was inhibited by actinomycin, LPL mRNA decreased with half-lives of 13.3 and 16.8 h in the fed and fasted states, respectively, demonstrating slow turnover of the LPL transcript. Surprisingly, when actinomycin was given to fed rats, LPL activity was not down-regulated during fasting, indicating that actinomycin interferes with the transcription of a gene that blocks the activation of newly synthesized LPL protein. When actinomycin was given to fasted rats, LPL activity increased 4-fold within 6 h, even in the absence of refeeding. The same effect was seen with α-amanitin, another inhibitor of transcription. The response to actinomycin was much less pronounced in aging rats, which are obese and insulin-resistant. These data suggest a default state where LPL protein is synthesized on a relatively stable mRNA and is processed into its active form. During fasting, a gene is switched on whose product prevents the enzyme from becoming active even though synthesis of LPL protein continues unabated."

Recently, others have shown that adding TNFα to cultures of ethanol-pretreated hepatocytes provokes the mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome crelease, procaspase 3 activation, and apoptosis. Although this demonstrates that ethanol can sensitize hepatocytes to TNF-mediated apoptosis, the hepatic inflammation and ballooning hepatocyte degeneration that typify alcohol-induced liver injury suggest that other mechanisms might predominate in vivo. To evaluate this possibility, acute responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent inducer of TNFα, were compared in mice that had been fed either an ethanol-containing or control diet for 5 weeks. Despite enhanced induction of cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10, IL-15, and IL-6 that protect hepatocytes from apoptosis, ethanol-fed mice exhibited a 4–5-fold increase in serum alanine aminotransferase after LPS, confirming increased liver injury. Six h post-LPS histology also differed notably in the two groups, with control livers demonstrating only scattered apoptotic hepatocytes, whereas ethanol-exposed livers had large foci of ballooned hepatocytes, inflammation, and scattered hemorrhage. No caspase 3 activity was noted during the initial 6 h after LPS in ethanol-fed mice, but this tripled by 1.5 h after LPS in controls. Procaspase 8 cleavage and activity of the apoptosis-associated kinase, Jun N-terminal kinase, were also greater in controls. In contrast, ethanol exposure did not inhibit activation of cytoprotective mitogen-activated protein kinases and AKT or attenuate induction of the anti-apoptotic factors NF-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Consistent with these responses, neither cytochrome c release, an early apoptotic response, nor hepatic oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, the ultimate consequence of apoptosis, was increased by ethanol.

Alcohol Alcohol. 1985; 20: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar). These clinical observations suggest that ethanol exposure enhances hepatic vulnerability to a secondary inflammatory or oxidative stress, such that serious liver injury is most likely to occur when proinflammatory/pro-oxidant factors are superimposed onto a background of ethanol use (10.Day C.P. James O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 842-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). Because tumor necrosis factor-α ((TNFα)1 and cytokines that potentiate TNF activity are the common, proximal mediators of inflammatory liver injury (11.Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar, 12.Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 13.Baker S.J.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The evidence supporting this concept is growing. For example, animal studies demonstrate that ethanol enhances liver injury caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14.Honchel R. Ray R.B. Marsano L. Cohen D. Lee E. Shedlosky S. McClain C.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a process that requires TNFα (19.Mayeux P.R. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1997; 51: 415-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of the gene that encodes the TNF type 1 receptor (TNFR-1) completely protects mice from the liver injury that results from chronic intragastric infusions of ethanol (17.Yin M. Wheeler M.D. Kono H. Bradford B.U. Gallucci R.M. Luster M.I. Thurman R.G. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 942-952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). The latter finding demonstrates that TNFα is required for ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Assuming that similar mechanisms operate in humans who habitually consume alcohol-containing beverages, then is it important to delineate the cellular mechanisms that mediate ethanol-related sensitization to TNF lethality.Healthy hepatocytes are typically resistant to TNFα toxicity unless they have been pretreated with agents that inhibit protein synthesis. Under such circumstances, TNFα induces the mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and eventually causes death by apoptosis (20.Leist M. Cantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.C. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Hoek and colleague (18.Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) showed that ethanol mimics these effects of protein synthesis inhibitors. That is, when HepG2 cells or primary rat hepatocytes that have been pretreated with ethanol are exposed to TNFα in vitro, mitochondrial permeability transition, cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, and apoptosis ensue. Because treatment of these cultures with mitochondrial permeability transition inhibitors rescues them from TNF lethality, these authors (18.Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) concluded that ethanol sensitizes the liver to injury by potentiating TNF-induced apoptosis.The purpose of the present study is to determine whether similar mechanisms operate in vivo. To accomplish this, ethanol and pair-fed mice were given a single intraperitoneal injection of LPS, and subsequent liver damage as well as antecedent activation of mechanisms that promote and inhibit apoptosis were compared. Surprisingly, although ethanol exposure markedly enhanced LPS-induced liver injury under these experimental conditions, it actually inhibited caspase 3 activation. Moreover, the increased liver damage in the ethanol-fed group was not associated with increased cytochrome c release or nuclear oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a discordance between the previously reported in vitro mechanisms for ethanol hepatotoxicity and those that operate to sensitize ethanol-exposed livers to TNF toxicity in vivo. In vivo, ethanol-related potentiation of TNF-mediated liver injury does not require caspase 3 activation, and hepatocyte death appears to result more from lysis rather than from increased, classical apoptosis.DISCUSSIONDecades of research have culminated in relatively recent insights that are widely believed to explain paradoxical inter- and intra-individual differences in the vulnerability to alcohol-induced liver damage. Namely, several lines of evidence suggest that serious alcohol-related liver damage requires the introduction of an inflammatory or oxidant stress to ethanol-exposed livers that have become partially depleted of various survival factors that normally protect hepatocyte viability (58.Tilg H. Diehl A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 1467-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Thus, moment-to-moment differences in the balance between cytotoxic and cytoprotective factors dictate the severity of alcohol-related liver damage at any given point in time. Several laboratories have exploited this general concept to develop cell culture and animal models that can be studied to characterize molecular targets for future therapeutic interventions. Work from many different groups identifies TNFα as a critical mediator of alcohol-related liver damage (14.Honchel R. Ray R.B. Marsano L. Cohen D. Lee E. Shedlosky S. McClain C.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15.Zeldin G. Rai R. Yang S.Q. Lin H.Z. Yin M. Diehl A.M. Alcohol. Clin. Exp.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Recent studies of hepatocytes that were exposed to ethanol and then treated with TNFα in vitro demonstrated an enhanced induction of several events that are involved in apoptotic cell death (18.Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), raising the exciting possibility that agents that prevent TNF-dependent activation of caspase 3 might be effective as treatments for alcoholic liver disease. However, although there is evidence of increased hepatocyte apoptosis in some patients and experimental animals with alcohol-related liver damage (59.Galle P.R. J. Hepatol. 1997; 27: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 60.Goldin R.D. Hunt N.C. Clark J. Wickeramasinghe S.N. J.

Res. 1995; 19: 854-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the typical histologic features of alcohol-induced steatohepatitis include hepatocyte swelling and inflammation (63.MacSween R.N.M. Burt A.D. Semin. Liver Dis. 1986; 6: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Classically, such features have been attributed to necrotic processes (64.Rothschild, M. A., Berk, P. D., and Lieber, C. S. (1993)Semin. Liver Dis. 13(2)Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to confirm that enhanced vulnerability to TNF-mediated apoptosis actually occurs during in vivo situations in which ethanol is known to potentiate TNF-related liver damage.The results of our study demonstrate that ethanol-related potentiation of TNF-mediated liver injury does not require the activation of procaspase 3. Moreover, we find that increased liver damage in ethanol-fed mice occurs despite robust, acute induction of various survival responses, including MAPKs, AKT, NF-κB, and iNOS, which usually protect hepatocytes from apoptosis following LPS exposure (30.Kim Y.M.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Indeed, in this in vivo model of alcohol-related liver damage, there is compelling evidence that prior ethanol exposure inhibits classical apoptotic signaling because it prevents the activation of both procaspase 8 and JNK. The former normally functions as an initiator caspase for death receptor-induced apoptosis, and the latter is necessary for stress-induced procaspase 3 activation and subsequent apoptosis in many cell types (32.Tournier C.

Consistent with this concept, we were unable to demonstrate increased cytochrome c release or nuclear oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in LPS-treated ethanol-fed mice, although these animals developed worse liver damage than the PF controls. Taken together, these results suggest that enhanced apoptosis might not be the major mechanism for alcohol-related liver damage.This conclusion is supported by earlier work from Colell et al. (67.Colell A. Garcia-Ruiz C. Miranda M. Ardite E. Mari M. Morales A. Corrales F. Kaplowitz N. Fernandez-Checa J.C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 1541-1551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which showed that hepatocytes from ethanol-fed rats are deficient in mitochondrial glutathione and, after incubation with TNFα in vitro, produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide and undergo necrosis. Evidence that ethanol potentiates TNF-mediated hepatocyte necrosis is not inconsistent with other reports showing that ethanol potentiates TNF-induced hepatocyte apoptosis (18.Pastorino J.G. Hoek J.B. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), because seemingly discordant effects of ethanol on apoptosis can be reconciled by model-dependent differences in factors that modulate cellular responses to TNFα. For example, other cytokines are powerful regulators of TNFα bioactivity (12.Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). These factors are produced primarily by hepatic macrophages (68.Decker K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 192: 245-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar) and thus are not abundant in hepatocyte cultures. Our ribonuclease protection analyses of liver RNA demonstrate that in vivo exposure to ethanol amplifies basal and LPS-related induction of several cytokines that inhibit apoptosis. At least one of these (i.e. IL-15) inhibits the recruitment of adaptor molecules to the cytosolic domains of Fas and TNFR-1, blocking the propagation of apoptotic signals that are normally initiated by these receptors (57.Waldman T.A. Dubois S. Tagaya Y. Immunity. 2001; 14: 105-110PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in intact mice, IL-15 and other cytokines may abrogate apoptotic responses that proceed unchecked in isolated hepatocytes cultured without these factors. Additional experiments are needed to evaluate this possibility directly. Chronic ethanol exposure also modifies the availability of intracellular factors that regulate apoptosis. For example, chronic consumption of ethanol inhibits hepatic mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis in patients and experimental animals (69.Cunningham C.C. Coleman W.B. Spach P.I. Alcohol Alcoholism. 1990; 25: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 70.Hoek J.B. Lee C.P. Current Topics Bioenerg.17. Academic Press Limited, London1994: 197-241Google Scholar). This influences the zonal distribution of alcohol-related liver injury, which typically clusters in the most hypoxic parts of liver lobules around terminal hepatic venules, where we observed the most severe injury after LPS. However, hepatocytes in more well oxygenated areas of the liver usually are less ATP-depleted and survive (4.Thurman R.G. Ji S. Matsumura T. Lemasters J.J. Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 1984; 4: 125-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Israel Y. Orrego H. Recent Dev. Alcohol. 1984; 2: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Indeed, moderate reductions in cellular ATP content might even be somewhat protective (71.Lemasters J.J. Qian T. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Cascio W.E. Trost L.C. Nishimura Y. Nieminen A.-L. Herman B. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 305-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) because the final stages of caspase 3 activation do not occur when ATP levels dip below a certain threshold (72.Leist M. Single M. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). However, any situation that causes extreme ATP depletion impairs the functioning of ion transporters that regulate membrane permeability, and eventually this leads to organelle and cell lysis, i.e. necrosis (5.Israel Y. Orrego H. Recent Dev. Alcohol. 1984; 2: 119-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,73.Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar, 74.Kroemer G.

Because the liver perfusion protocols and other techniques required for hepatocyte purification and culture impose considerable hypoxia-reoxygenation stress (78.Klaunig J.E. Glodblatt P.J.

Cell Res. 1999; 246: 221-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that ethanol-exposed hepatocytes with marginal ATP stores can survive this process. Thus, only the healthiest liver cells with relatively normal ATP contents are likely to be cultured from ethanol-treated animals. This methodological obstacle is not overcome by exposing primary hepatocytes from ethanol-naive animals to ethanol in vitrobecause brief periods of ethanol treatment are probably not sufficient to reproduce the full spectrum of ethanol-related mitochondrial toxicity that inhibits hepatic ATP synthesis during chronic in vivo exposure to ethanol (84.Bailey S.M. Pietsch E.C. Cunningham C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Even efforts to substitute hepatocyte cell lines for primary hepatocytes are potentially problematic because, like other neoplastic cells, HepG2 cells have induced nonmitochondrial pathways for ATP synthesis (38.Capuano F. Guerrieri F. Papa S. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and thus might not experience ATP depletion despite ethanol-related mitochondrial toxicity. The fact that cells with relatively normal ATP stores are over-represented in the previously mentioned in vitro models introduces a bias that favors the apoptotic (rather than necrotic) death pathway.Thus, because in vitro hepatocyte culture systems do not fully reproduce the extra- or intracellular microenvironment of hepatocytes in intact livers, it is somewhat risky to extrapolate the resultant in vitro data to more clinically relevant in vivo models of chronic ethanol exposure (69.Cunningham C.C. Coleman W.B. Spach P.I. Alcohol Alcoholism. 1990; 25: 127-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 70.Hoek J.B. Lee C.P. Current Topics Bioenerg.17. Academic Press Limited, London1994: 197-241Google Scholar). This, in turn, has potentially important therapeutic implications that merit future evaluation because the in vivo data suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of caspase 3 may prove to be unnecessary (because it occurs naturally) in subjects who habitually consume alcohol. If so, then this intervention will not protect alcohol abusers from alcohol-related liver injury, and alternative therapeutic strategies will need to be developed for this important cause of chronic liver disease. Although ethyl alcohol has been recognized as a significant hepatotoxin for centuries, the mechanisms involved in alcohol-induced liver disease remain uncertain. It is known that chronic alcohol ingestion potentiates liver injury inflicted by many other toxins (1.Seeff L.B. Cuccherini B.A. Zimmerman H.J. Alder E. Benjamin S.B. Ann. Intern.

Alcohol Alcohol. 1985; 20: 137-142PubMed Google Scholar). These clinical observations suggest that ethanol exposure enhances hepatic vulnerability to a secondary inflammatory or oxidative stress, such that serious liver injury is most likely to occur when proinflammatory/pro-oxidant factors are superimposed onto a background of ethanol use (10.Day C.P. James O. Gastroenterology. 1998; 114: 842-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3406) Google Scholar). Because tumor necrosis factor-α ((TNFα)1 and cytokines that potentiate TNF activity are the common, proximal mediators of inflammatory liver injury (11.Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1798) Google Scholar, 12.Tracey K.J. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar, 13.Baker S.J.

Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1141-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The evidence supporting this concept is growing. For example, animal studies demonstrate that ethanol enhances liver injury caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14.Honchel R. Ray R.B. Marsano L. Cohen D. Lee E. Shedlosky S. McClain C.J. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1992; 16: 665-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a process that requires TNFα (19.Mayeux P.R. J. Toxicol. Environ. Health. 1997; 51: 415-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, disruption of the gene that encodes the TNF type 1 receptor (TNFR-1) completely protects mice from the liver injury that results from chronic intragastric infusions of ethanol (17.Yin M.

The latter finding demonstrates that TNFα is required for ethanol-induced liver disease in mice. Assuming that similar mechanisms operate in humans who habitually consume alcohol-containing beverages, then is it important to delineate the cellular mechanisms that mediate ethanol-related sensitization to TNF lethality. Healthy hepatocytes are typically resistant to TNFα toxicity unless they have been pretreated with agents that inhibit protein synt"

The amino acid sequence of Drosophila galectin showed striking sequence similarity to invertebrate and vertebrate galectins and contained amino acids that are crucial for binding β-galactoside sugars. Confirming its identity as a galectin family member, the Drosophila galectin bound β-galactoside sugars. Structurally, the Drosophila galectin was a tandem repeat galectin containing two carbohydrate recognition domains connected by a unique peptide link. This divalent structure suggests that like mammalian galectins, Drosophila galectin may mediate cell-cell communication or facilitate cross-linking of receptors to trigger signal transduction events. The Drosophilagalectin was very abundant in embryonic, larval, and adult Drosophila. During embryogenesis, Drosophilagalectin had a unique and specific tissue distribution.Drosophila galectin expression was concentrated in somatic and visceral musculature and in the central nervous system.

However, little is known about lectin-ligand interactions in Drosophila. Of the few Drosophila lectins that have been identified, a subset has been shown to be vital in embryogenesis and to function in innate immunity (1.Franc N.C. White K.

In embryonic Drosophila, two lectins, gliolectin and a selectin homologue, have been identified and determined to play a role in embryogenesis (4.Tiemeyer M. Goodman C.S. Development. 1996; 122: 925-936PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Leshko-Lindsay L. Corces V.G. Development. 1997; 124: 169-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gliolectin mediates cell-cell interactions that may be required for the formation of axonal commissures during nervous system development (4.Tiemeyer M. Goodman C.S. Development. 1996; 122: 925-936PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the selectin homologue lead to profound defects in eye and mechanosensory bristle development (5.Leshko-Lindsay L. Corces V.G. Development. 1997; 124: 169-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stage-specific regulation of the expression of specific glycoconjugates also occurs during Drosophila development, further suggesting important developmental roles for lectins (6.Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 7.D'Amico P. Jacobs J.R. Tissue & Cell. 1995; 27: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8.Fredieu J.R.

J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20213-20218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The expression of this C-type lectin is up-regulated following injury, suggesting that it has a role in the innate immune system. Other insects rely on lectins for recognition and phagocytosis of invading microorganisms and for the modulation of hemocyte aggregation during an immune response (1.Franc N.C. White K.

Because Drosophila express diverse and complex oligosaccharide structures whose expression is spatially and temporally regulated (6.Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is likely that these structures are recognized by additional specific lectins that remain to be identified. In support of this, a BLAST analysis of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project with consensus sequences from various lectin families has identified at least 21 putative Drosophila lectins, including a possible galectin homologue (6.Seppo A. Tiemeyer M. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 14.Theopold U. Rissler M. Fabbri M. Schmidt O. Natori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Galectins are an evolutionarily conserved lectin family that have been identified in mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, fish, nematodes, marine sponges, and multicellular fungi (15.Cooper D.N.W.

Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, galectins are involved in a variety of cellular processes that determine cell fate, by mediating cell-cell interactions, inducing cell proliferation, or regulating cell death (20.Pace K.E. Baum L.G. Trends Glycosci. Glycotechnol. 1997; 9: 21-29Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21.Perillo N.L. Marcus M.E. Baum L.G. J. Mol.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). For example, during mammalian brain development, galectin-1 promotes olfactory neuron fasciculation by cross-linking adjacent axons and promoting axonal adhesion to the extracellular matrix (24.Puche A.C. Poirier F. Hair M. Bartlett P.F. Keys B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 274-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25.Mahanthappa N.K. Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Schwarting G.A. Development. 1994; 120: 1373-1384PubMed Google Scholar). Galectins also maintain vertebrate immune system homeostasis and may be a vital component of the innate immune system in insects and mammals (12.Dimopoulos G. Richman A. Müller H.M. Kafatos F.C.

Given the large number of mammalian galectins, genetic approaches in mice may not elucidate all of the functions of specific galectins. The facile genetic analysis that is possible in Drosophila and the apparently small number of putative galectins in the Drosophila genome would simplify the examination of in vivo functions of galectins. We have cloned and characterized the first identified Drosophila galectin (Dmgal),1 and we have examined its distribution during embryogenesis and in the immune system. To obtain a complete cDNA sequence, 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (3′-RACE) was performed. 3′- and 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA was synthesized from larval poly(A)+ RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). For 5′- and 3′-RACE, a gene-specific primer (GSP1) was designed against a region of the expressed sequence tag (EST) (LP06039.5prime (15.Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar)) encoding a highly conserved amino acid sequence critical to saccharide binding. Touchdown PCR was performed with GSP1:GAGATGTGGCGCTCCACATTAATCCA according to manufacturer's instructions with the addition of a final cycle at 72 °C for 7 min to create poly(A) tails necessary for TOPO TA cloning. The PCR product was subcloned into the pCR4 TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and was sequenced by the Davis Sequencing Facility (Davis, CA). To ensure that the entire sequence was obtained, three additional GSPs were designed 174, 255, and 320 bp, respectively, downstream of GSP1. 3′-RACE was performed, the products subcloned into the pCR4 TOPO vector, and sequenced as described above. To generate full-length cDNA, long distance PCR was performed with primers designed from the extreme 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA and 5′-RACE-Ready cDNA as a template, using the Advantage cDNA PCR kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (CLONTECH). A final 12-min cycle at 72 °C was added to create poly(A) tails. The entire cDNA sequence was subcloned directly into the pTrcHis2 TOPO expression vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced to ensure orientation and completeness. Dmgal cDNA lacking a stop codon was subcloned into the pTrcHis2 TOPO expression vector to express the recombinant Drosophila protein with a C-terminal Myc-His tag. TOP10 One Shot cells (Invitrogen) were transformed with the expression vector and were induced to express recombinant protein with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min. The cell pellet was lysed with B-PER (Bio-Rad) containing 4 mmdithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma) for 10 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 20 min. The bacterial supernatant was loaded directly on a β-lactosyl-Sepharose affinity column prepared as described previously (29.Pace K.E. Lee C. Stewart P.L. Baum L.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3801-3811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a control fucosyl-Sepharose (Sigma) affinity column. The recombinant protein was not purified over a nickel column prior to carbohydrate affinity chromatography because this type of purification has been shown be ineffective for isolating active galectin-1. 2J. C. LeFebvre and L. G. Baum, unpublished observations. The carbohydrate affinity column was washed extensively with Ca2+,Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline, 4 mm DTT, 0.02% sodium azide (wash buffer). Bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m β-lactose or 0.1 mfucose dissolved in wash buffer. Eluted fractions were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. Wild type embryonic, third instar larval, and adult Drosophila were Dounce-homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline, 4 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mβ-lactose (30.Hirabayashi J. Satoh M. Kasai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15485-15490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenate was rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, and soluble proteins were collected following centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. A protein assay (Bio-Rad) was performed, and known quantities of homogenate were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. To purify native Dmgal, 8.8 mg of protein homogenate from third instar larvae and adult Drosophila was obtained as described above. The protein homogenate was loaded directly onto a β-lactosyl column, washed with wash buffer, and eluted with 0.1 m β-lactose. Eluted proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting. To evaluate the binding of Dmgal to β-lactosyl-Sepharose, the adult protein homogenate prior to purification over the lactose column, the unbound fraction, and the bound fraction were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, Western blotting, and protein assay (Bio-Rad). Northern blot hybridization was performed with 2.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from embryonic, larval, and adult Drosophila (CLONTECH) and Dmgal cDNA as a probe. The Dmgal probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed in Rapid-Hyb hybridization buffer (Amersham Biosciences) for 1.5 h at 68 °C. Stringency washes were performed at 25, 42, and 68 °C using standard procedures and checked by autoradiography between each stringency wash. Similar results were obtained for each stringency wash. Western blotting was performed using standard immunoblotting techniques followed by enhanced chemiluminescence for protein visualization. Antibody concentrations were as follows: rabbit anti-human galectin-1 polyclonal antiserum (1/1000), horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-His antibody (1/4000; Invitrogen), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1/6000; Bio-Rad). Full-length digoxigenin-labeled RNA probes were prepared from the pSPUTK vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) containing full-length Dmgal cDNA. The vector was linearized upstream of the insert with NheI and downstream of the insert with HpaI. Sense and antisense digoxigenin-labeled RNAs were produced using the SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases according to the manufacturer's directions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The probes were base-hydrolyzed for 30 min to generate ∼200-base pair fragments. An overnight collection of Drosophila embryos was dechorionated and fixed with 10% paraformaldehyde. In situ hybridization was performed using standard procedures and visualized with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (1/2000; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Smears of circulating hemocytes from third instar hemolymph were formed by cutting larvae with tweezers and spreading the hemolymph on a glass slide. The smears were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained exactly as described previously (31.Dong X. Tsuda L. Zavitz K.H. Lin M. Zipursky S.L.

Polyclonal rabbit anti-human galectin-1 antibody was used at a concentration of 1/500 and goat anti-rabbit-fluorescein (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) was used at a concentration of 1/100. Images were collected on a Olympus Flowview confocal microscope with the ×100 objective and analyzed with Fluoview Image Analysis software (version 2.1.39) A partial EST with amino acid sequence similarity to the carbohydrate recognition domain of galectin family members was identified (15.Cooper D.N.W. Barondes S.H. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To isolate the entire cDNA, 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed using gene-specific primers directed against the segments that showed greatest similarity to galectin, and Drosophila larval poly(A)+ RNA as a template. The Dmgal gene is located on chromosome 2L, 21A5 (32.Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. et al.Science. 2000; 287: 2185-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (4854) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by the complete cDNA is shown in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequence contained important elements that are required for a protein to be defined as a galectin family member (33.Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K.-I. Leffler H. Liu F.-T. Cell. 1994; 76: 597-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). Specifically, Dmgal contained two domains that had sequence similarity to the canonical carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) of galectin family members (Fig. 1). Both CRDs contained the conserved sequence motifs H-NPR and WG-ER that are important for the binding of galectins to β-galactoside sugars (Fig. 1) (34.Bournes Y. Bolgiano B. Liao D.-I. Strecker G. Cantau P. Herzberg O. Feizi T. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), in contrast to the mammalian tandem repeat galectin, galectin-12, in which only one CRD contained these sequence motifs (18.Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The two CRDs were connected by a unique peptide link that had some sequence similarity to the peptide link of galectin-9. This structural organization classifies Dmgal into the group of tandem repeat-type galectins that contain two CRDs connected by a unique peptide link (35.Hirabayashi J. Kasai K.-I. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 depicts the Dmgal CRD organization that was derived following comparison of Dmgal with known mammalian galectin sequences and structures and by sequence comparison between each CRD. Other galectins that are classified in the tandem repeat family are galectins-4, -6, -8, -9, and -12 and the Caenorhabditis elegans 32-kDa galectin (18.Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J.

Examination of the CRDs of Dmgal suggested that each domain may differ with respect to the ability to bind sugar ligands. In the N-terminal CRD (CRD I), there was an Arg to Val substitution at amino acid 206. In most galectin family members this Arg stabilizes galectin-carbohydrate interactions (40.Lobsanov Y.D. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. Barondes S.H. Rini J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27034-27038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, in other galectins this Arg is substituted with Lys (galectin-4, Xenopus galectin), Ile (galectin-8), and His (sponge galectin I), and these galectins retain the ability to bind β-galactoside sugars (36.Oda Y.

This amino acid is also substituted with Gln and Ile in Conger eel Lec1 and C. elegans 32-kDaa galectin, respectively. Interestingly, CRD I had the highest sequence similarity to galectin-4, -5, and -9, and CRD II had the highest sequence similarity to galectin-4 (36.Oda Y. Herrman J. Gitt M.A. Turck C.W.

Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Characteristic of galectin family members, the amino acid sequence of Dmgal did not contain a classical secretion signal peptide or a transmembrane domain (33.Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K.-I. Leffler H. Liu F.-T. Cell. 1994; 76: 597-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). However, the sequence did contain a 120-amino acid N-terminal domain that is not found in other galectins and shows no significant sequence identity with any other known protein (Fig. 1). This domain is likely to adopt a secondary helical structure (43.Geourjon C. Deléage G. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Characteristic of galectins, Dmgal did not contain a Ca2+ binding domain. Dmgal showed significant amino acid sequence similarity to galectin family members from various species (identity 23–35%). The alignment of Dmgal with galectins from selected species and the computation of sequence identities and similarity groups were generated using Genedoc (version 2.6.001) and ClustalX (version 1.8) (35.Hirabayashi J.

Fink N.E. Strobel F. Vasta G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3308-33094Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Dmgal had a great deal of sequence similarity with human galectin-4 and murine galectin-9, which are also tandem repeat galectins (38.Wada K. Kanwar Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6078-6086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 44.Rechreche H. Mallo G.V. Montalto G. Dagorn J.C. Iovanna J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the similarity with these two mammalian tandem repeat galectins was slightly greater than that with the C. elegans tandem repeat galectin, demonstrating the strong conservation across vertebrate and invertebrate species. A BLAST search of the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project with the putative Dmgal amino acid sequence resulted in seven matches with a smallest sum probability value less than 0.5. One of the sequences was identical to the Dmgal sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AE003590) However, five of the remaining six sequences lacked some of the amino acids considered critical for binding β-galactoside sugars (GenBankTM accession numbersAE003590, AE003799, AE003588, AE003713, and AE003583) (34.Bournes Y. Bolgiano B. Liao D.-I. Strecker G. Cantau P. Herzberg O. Feizi T. Cambillau C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Only one sequence (GenBankTM accession number AE003514) contained amino acids involved in β-galactoside sugar recognition. However, more studies are necessary to determine whether this is a true galectin family member capable of binding β-galactoside sugars. The defining feature of galectin family members is the ability to bind β-galactoside sugars (33.Barondes S.H. Castronovo V. Cooper D.N.W. Cummings R.D. Hirabayashi J. Hughes C. Kasai K.-I. Leffler H. Liu F.-T. Cell. 1994; 76: 597-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1111) Google Scholar). We expressed recombinant Dmgal with a C-terminal His tag and asked if the protein would specifically bind to a β-lactose affinity column. The His-tagged Dmgal was not purified over a nickel column prior to carbohydrate affinity chromatography because this type of purification has been shown to be ineffective for isolating active galectin.2 Therefore, the entire bacterial supernatant was loaded directly on a β-lactose or fucose affinity column, and bound protein was eluted with β-lactose or fucose, respectively, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-His antibody. A single band of 58 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of Dmgal, eluted from the β-lactose column but not the fucose column (Fig. 3A). This demonstrated that Dmgal bound specifically to β-galactoside sugars and confirmed its identity as a galectin family member. Because all galectin family members share structural similarities within their CRDs, we reasoned that a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for human galectin-1 might cross-react with Dmgal. The anti-His blot was stripped and reprobed with polyclonal rabbit anti-human galectin-1. As shown in Fig. 3A, the anti-human galectin-1 cross-reacted with Dmgal, providing further evidence for strong structural similarities among galectins from different species. Because the anti-human galectin-1 antibody bound Dmgal, we used this antibody as a reagent to determine the stage or stages of Drosophila development where Dmgal was expressed. 5 μg of total protein homogenate from embryonic, third instar larval and adult flies was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-human galectin-1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, a prominent 58-kDa band was expressed at all three stages. In addition, the Mr of native Dmgal matched the Mr of the predicted amino acid sequence. This suggests that Dmgal is not glycosylated, consistent with synthesis of galectin family members within the cytosol (47.Harrison F.L. Wilson T.J. J. Ce"
https://openalex.org/W2051742466,"cDNAs encoding KEPI, a novel protein kinase C (PKC)-potentiated inhibitory protein for type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP1), were identified. They were found among morphine-regulated brain mRNAs identified using subtracted differential display techniques. Full-length rat, mouse, and human cDNA and genomic sequences were elucidated with library screening and data base searching. Rat, mouse, and human KEPI cDNAs encode 164–165 amino acid proteins with calculated isoelectric points of 5.2. Each species' amino acid sequence contains consensus sequences for phosphorylation by PKC (KVT72VK), protein kinase A (RKLS154), and casein kinase II (S43SRE, S120EEE). Multiple KEPI N-terminal myristoylation consensus sites provide potential regions for membrane anchoring. Subcellular fractionation and Western analyses revealed that most KEPI immunoreactivity was associated with P2 and P3 membrane-enriched fractions and little in cytosolic fractions. 2.6-kb KEPI mRNAs were detected in brain, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and in heart and skeletal muscle. Brain KEPI mRNA was up-regulated by both acute and chronic morphine treatments. The human KEPI gene contains four exons extending over more than 100 kb of genomic sequence on 6q24-q25, near the μ opiate receptor gene. These sequences displayed sufficient homology with the porcine PP1 inhibitor CPI-17 that we asked whether KEPI could share the ability of CPI-17 to modulate PP1 activity in a PKC-dependent fashion. Recombinant mouse KEPI is phosphorylated by PKC with a Km of 2.6 μm and a t1/2 of 20 min. Phospho-KEPI inhibits PP1α with an IC50 of 2.7 nm, a potency more than 600-fold greater than that displayed by unphosphorylated KEPI. Neither phospho- nor dephospho-KEPI inhibits protein phosphatase 2A. Up-regulation of KEPI expression by morphine, an agonist at PKC-regulating G-protein-coupled μ receptors, provides a novel signaling paradigm in which the half-lives of serine/threonine phosphorylation events can be influenced by activities at Gi/Go-coupled receptors that modulate KEPI expression, KEPI phosphorylation, and KEPI regulation of PP1 activity. cDNAs encoding KEPI, a novel protein kinase C (PKC)-potentiated inhibitory protein for type 1 Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP1), were identified.

Morphine activation of Gi/Go-coupled μ receptors alters second messengers, ion fluxes, and gene expression patterns in ways that could contribute to long term consequences of μ receptor occupancy such as tolerance, dependence, and addiction (8.Wang X.B.

We have developed and used modifications of subtractive hybridization and differential display (SDD)-PCR approaches to seek morphine-regulated genes. These approaches thus provide a number of short cDNAs that correspond to morphine-regulated mRNAs. To define interesting novel genes that might correspond to these apparently morphine-regulated cDNAs, we have screened mouse and rat brain cDNA libraries with probes derived from pools of short cDNAs that were morphine-regulated in initial SDD experiments. One of these cDNAs hybridized to a novel 2.6-kb mRNA species that was expressed specifically in brain, heart, and muscle and was up-regulated by acute and chronic morphine treatments in brain. The sequence of this cDNA displayed homologies with the previously elucidated CPI-17 and PHI/PNG genes (11.Eto M. Karginov A. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16952-16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), which are PKC-potentiated inhibitors of the major serine/threonine type 1 protein phosphatase, PP1. We now report elucidation of this novel gene, termed “KEPI” (kinase-enhanced PP1 inhibitor), describe its ability to serve as a PKC substrate, and document its phosphorylation-dependent ability to inhibit PP1 selectively. Definition of this protein and related sequences provides an expanded view of an emerging family of potential PKC-dependent PP1 inhibitors. Elucidating KEPI regulation by morphine also provides a novel mechanism for longer term effects of morphine on a variety of cellular signaling pathways, including those that might contribute to tolerance, dependence, and addiction. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250–300 g), wild type C57BL/6J mice, and μ receptor knockout mice (13.Sora I. Takahashi N. Funada M. Ujike H. Revay R.S. Donovan D.M. Miner L.L. Uhl G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Rats were injected intraperitoneally with 20 mg/kg morphine or saline, sacrificed 4 h later, and their brains were removed rapidly. Frontal cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus were dissected on ice, and tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen. For chronic morphine treatments, rats or mice were implanted subcutaneously with pellets containing 75 or 25 mg of morphine, respectively, or matched placebo controls (National Institute on Drug Abuse, Division of Basic Research). Animals were sacrificed 4 days after implantation, and brain regions (rat) or whole brains (mice) were dissected. RNA was isolated from frozen brain tissues using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX), and SDD was carried out as described (8.Wang X.B. Uhl G.R. Brain Res. Mol.

Radiolabeled PCR fragments displaying substantial intensity differences between morphine and saline treatments were excised, eluted, and subcloned into the PCRII vector (Invitrogen). Northern blot (8.Wang X.B. Uhl G.R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 53: 344-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and RNA dot-blot analyses (15.Chan W.Y. Liu Q.R. Borjigin J. Busch H. Rennert O.M. Tease L.A. Chan P.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) were performed as described. KEPI hybridization was analyzed by ImageQuaNTTM (Storm 860, Amersham Biosciences) and normalized to β-actin expression. Plasmids containing SDD fragments were purified with Qiagen-tips (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). cDNA inserts were excised with appropriate enzymes, purified from agarose gels, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a multiprimer labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences). Approximately 1.2 × 106plaques from a neonatal mouse brain cDNA library, cloned in the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the Uni-ZAP XR vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and a similar number of plaques of a rat cerebral cortex cDNA library, cloned into EcoRI site of λ-ZAP II vector (Stratagene), were screened with pools of 5–20 radiolabeled rat SDD probes. Positive plaques were identified, plasmids excised, and clones purified as described (16.Liu Q.R. Lopez-Corcuera B. Mandiyan S. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2106-2112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Longer cDNA clones were subcloned further as smaller EcoRI restriction fragments, and both strands were subjected to dideoxynucleotide dye termination sequencing using 373A automatic DNA sequencing and primer walking (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequencher (Version 3.0, Gene Code Co.)-assembled sequence data and GCG and NCBI tools provided comparisons. We focused on a 2.2-kb murine cDNA insert that we termed initially B16. A translation initiation site adaptor with sequence GCGCGGGGcCATGgCGGTGGTG, which provided a new NcoI restriction site (underlined), was used to amplify a 2-kb segment of the B16 cDNA clone including its entire open reading frame. PCR products were digested with NcoI at the translation initiation site and HindIII at the 3′-UTR end of the sequence and cloned into NcoI/HindIII sites of the bacterial expression vector pET30a (Novagen, Madison, WI) to form pET30aB16. The initiation methionine of pET30aB16 was positioned so that the B16 open reading frame followed the His tag peptide in-frame. BL21(DE3)Escherichia coli cells were transformed with pET30aB16, grown at 37 °C in LB/kanamycin for 2–3 h, induced using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, grown at 37 °C for 3 h, lysed by sonication, boiled for 5 min, and centrifuged at 6,000 × g for 10 min. Fusion protein was purified from the supernatant by metal chelation chromatography as described (HisTrap kit, Amersham Biosciences), quantitated using Bradford assays (Bio-Rad), and its purity was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (15% gel). Recombinant HisB16-KEPI protein was tested as a substrate for purified rat brain PKCα, β1, β2, and γ isoforms (Calbiochem). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out at 30 °C in 100 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 20 μg/ml diacylglycerol, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 2 ng of PKC, and 3 μm HisB16-KEPI protein. Phosphorylation was stopped by adding 20 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution and 1 ml of 25% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C. Phospho-HisB16-KEPI was precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with 5% trichloroacetic acid.32P-Labeled proteins were assessed by scintillation counting and by 15% SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For time course studies, aliquots of the reaction were sampled after 5-, 10-, 20-, 30-, 60-, and 90-min incubations. For kinetic studies, varying concentrations of HisB16-KEPI fusion proteins were used as PKC substrates. Triplicate data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad (San Diego). A protein phosphatase assay system (Invitrogen) provided differential measurements of PP1 and PP2A activities in dephosphorylating the glycolytic enzyme phosphorylase (17.Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Phosphorylase A was labeled with [γ32P]ATP according to the manufacturer's protocol, purified by PD-10 Sephadex column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), and [32P]phosphorylase A protein concentrations were measured using Bradford assays. Dephosphorylation reactions were carried out with 0.3 unit of rabbit muscle PP1α or 5 ng of bovine kidney PP2A1 (Calbiochem) in 60 μl containing 6 μm[32P]phosphorylase A and various concentrations of phospho-HisB16-KEPI or unphosphorylated HisB16-KEPI as inhibitors. Maximal phosphatase activities were assessed in reactions using no inhibitors. Nonspecific blank values were determined in reactions with no phosphatases. Samples were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, proteins were precipitated with 160 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid and centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and released free 32P in 200-μl supernatant samples was quantitated by scintillation counting. Triplicate data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using GraphPad. A 15-amino acid peptide with the sequence HQQGKVTVKYDRKEL, which corresponded to residues 66–80 of mKEPI protein, was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits that produced KEPI-specific antiserum G631 after initial immunization and boosting immunizations (Genemed Synthesis, Inc., San Francisco). Specificity was documented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers of >1:10,000 against the immunizing peptide; initial results of immunohistochemical experiments documenting specific, apparently specific, patterns of brain immunoreactivity 2J.-P. Gong, Q.-R. Liu, and G. R. Uhl, manuscript in preparation.; results of Western analyses including effective competition for Western staining by preincubation with the 15-amino acid KEPI peptide; and the absence of immunoreactive KEPI (iKEPI) in tissues that express high levels of other members of the KEPI family. Nuclear (P1), synaptosome-enriched (P2), microsome-enriched (P3), and cytosol (S100) fractions were prepared from rat cerebral cortex using sucrose differential centrifugation (18.Tsao L.I. Su T.P. Synapse. 1997; 25: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) followed by concentration of cytosolic proteins using Millipore Microcon-10 filters. Protein levels were quantitated using Bradford assays. To assess regional distribution of iKEPI, rat tissues were homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10 μg/mg bovine serum albumin, 300 μg/mg phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/mg aprotinin, 10 μg/mg leupeptin, and 100 μmNa3VO4. Supernatants were cleared by microcentrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed using 10% SDS-PAGE, elecrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and protein blots incubated with KEPI peptide antiserum diluted 1:1,000-fold for detection of iKEPI using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody as described previously (15.Chan W.Y. Liu Q.R. Borjigin J. Busch H. Rennert O.M. Tease L.A. Chan P.K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In experiments to determine specificity, primary antisera were incubated with 1 μg/ml KEPI peptide for 5 min prior to application to the blots. cDNA sequences were assembled using Sequencher. BLAST searches including human, rat, and mouse EST nucleotide sequences homologous to KEPI sequences used www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/. Protein structure and potential evolutionary patterns were analyzed with GCG Seqweb seqweb.ncifcrf.gov:737/gcg-bin/seqweb.cgi (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Human genomic BAC clones were located and mapped at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/guide/H_sapiens.html. cDNA clones that hybridized to pooled radiolabeled SDD probes were found in both rat and mouse brain cDNA libraries. Positive clones were further selected by hybridization with single short cDNAs. One of the longest inserts was the 2201-nucleotide clone B16. This sequence displayed a consensus sequence for translational initiation (19.Kozak M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 947-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). No in-frame stop codon was found in the 5′-regions of clone B16. Alignment of mouse EST sequencesAL605782 and AA671272 provided an additional 390 nucleotides and a 5′-UTR to form an extended B16 cDNA. This extended B16 cDNA contains 2546 nucleotides and an in-frame stop codon located at nucleotide position 335 in the 5′-UTR of this sequence. 164 amino acids are encoded between the translation initiation codon (ATG) at nucleotide position 518 and the translation termination codon (TGA) at nucleotide position 1010 (Fig. 1). A poly(A) signal (AATAAA) is located at nucleotide positions 2507–2512, 13 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail (20.Proudfoot N.J. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1976; 263: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (1911) Google Scholar). An additional poly(A) signal (AATAAC) is located at nucleotide position 1096–1101, 17 bp 5′ from the shorter poly(A) site at 1118. Mouse and rat EST sequences display both sites for poly(A) addition, potentially varying the lengths of their 3′-UTRs. Rat sequences were derived from a partial rat B16 cDNA whose 5′-sequence was augmented by information from rat EST sequences BF567111 and BF560736. The extended rat cDNA sequences encode an open reading frame of 164 amino acids which displays 96% identity with mouse B16 amino acid sequences. The calculated molecular masses of the mouse and rat translation products are 17.75 and 17.98 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). Human EST sequencesAW290962, AA627753, AA846873, BE171609, AA788675, AW182882, C02977,AA368804 and N32557, together with genomic exons overlapping the coding region, allow assembly of a human B16 cDNA that encodes 165 amino acids. The additional amino acid in the human sequence, Gln-60, is not found in either rodent sequence. The human B16 protein has a predicted unmodified molecular mass of 17.84 kDa and displays 91% amino acid identity with mouse sequence. Mouse and rat cDNA and EST sequences reveal polymorphisms at a tetranucleotide CCTT repeat at nucleotide positions corresponding to position 2240 in the murine 3′-UTR. Mouse EST sequences contain 1, 9, or 10 CCTT repeats at this site, whereas rat EST sequences contain 1, 2, or 3 CCTT repeats. However, human EST sequences available to date each display a single CCTT sequence at the corresponding position.Figure 2Panel A, amino acid sequences of KEPIs from different species.

The predicted protein is acidic, with an isoelectric point of 5.22 (Genetics Computer Group Isoelectric). The N-terminal residues 20–24, RVFFQ, contain a basic amino acid followed by two hydrophobic residues, recently described as a consensus PP1 binding motif (21.Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: R13-R23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The N-terminal 50 amino acids could form a secondary structure with 12 predicted turns interrupting a more regularly spaced β-sheet structure (Genetics Computer Group PlotStructure). 10 N-terminal region glycine residues, Gly at positions 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15, 28, 31, 32, and 35, provide potential N-myristoylation sites (Genetics Computer Group Motif). There is a predicted 45% chance that C-terminal region amino acids 90–140 form a coiled-coil structure (Genetics Computer Group CoilScan). Potential phosphoacceptor sites for PKC are identified at the Thr-72, for PKA at Ser-154, and for casein kinase II at Ser-43 and Ser-120 (Fig. 1). Each of these potential phosphorylation and acylation motifs is conserved in human, mouse, and rat B16 sequences (Fig. 2A). Murine B16 sequences from residues 70 to the C terminus are 67% identical to those of PNG/PHI (human PNG,X91195; mouse PNG, NM_008889) and 51% identical to porcine CPI-17 (AB008376). They are also 38% identical to human hypothetical protein FLJ29251 (AK000258) that we have named “GCPI”, for gut and cerebral cortex PP1 inhibitor. 3Q.-R. Liu and G. R. Uhl, manuscript in preparation. They display 29% identity with the Drosophila CG17124 gene product (AE003629) (12.Eto M. Senba S. Morita F. Yazawa M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 356-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 22.Kedra D. Carson E. Weber G. Lagercrantz J. Biochem. Mol. Biol.

Kedra D. Carson E. Nordenskjold M. Dumanski J.P. Weber G. Piehl F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The 13 C-terminal amino acids near the Thr-72 potential site for PKC activity are absolutely conserved in each member of this gene family (Fig. 2B) The K/R XT XK/R sequences that constitute typical PKC phosphoacceptor sites are also conserved in each of the family members except the Drosophila CG17124 protein, which displays an alternative PKC recognition motif FLTAK at an analogous position (Fig. 2B). The gene family that contains KEPI can be tentatively divided into two subfamilies based on protein isoelectric points. Human KEPI, human PNG/PHI, and Drosophila CG17124 gene products are acidic proteins with pI values of 5.22, 5.53, and 5.86, respectively. On the other hand, hCPI-17 and human FLJ29251/GCPI gene products are more basic with pI values of 10.7 and 7.9, respectively. Table I compares these family members. A plausible evolution analysis (Genetics Computer Group EvolutionTree) demonstrates that the PKC-potentiated PP1 inhibitor family is conserved from invertebrate insects (Drosophila) to vertebrate mammalian species separated by more than 500 million years of evolution (25.Nelson N. Lill H. J. Exp. Biol. 1994; 196: 213-228PubMed Google Scholar). Because only a single member is currently identified in the Drosophila genome, it is possible that an ancestral gene was duplicated and modified in eukaryotic organisms in response to pressures for greater signaling pathway complexities.Table IMembers of human PKC-potentiated PP1 inhibitory protein familyProteinLocusGene identificationGenemRNAAmino acidsMolecular massIsoelectric pointkbkbkDahKEPI6q2511419030107.32.616517.844.92hPHI11q1311604622.51.019920.964.96hGCPI15q151143160213.30.814516.517.92hCPI19q13114257625.20.614716.6910.15 Open table in a new tab Northern analyses using a radiolabeled hybridization probe consisting of a 700-bp EcoRI fragment from the mouse B16-KEPI 3′-UTR just 3′ to the shorter polyadenylation site detect a 2.6-kb mRNA expressed in several brain regions, spinal cord, heart, and muscle (Fig. 3A). A 270-bp radiolabeled rat hybridization probe containing sequences 5′ to the shorter poly(A) signal site recognizes an additional, less intensely expressed 1.2-kb mRNA, consistent with the lower level expression of a shorter mRNA with alternative polyadenylation (data not shown). KEPI mRNA was detected in heart and muscle, but not in liver, kidney, testis, ovary, intestine, stomach, or spleen (some hybridization data not shown). KEPI mRNA is up-regulated in mouse brain after chronic morphine treatment (Fig. 3B). KEPI mRNA is regulated differentially in different rat brain regions after acute and chronic morphine treatments (Fig. 3C). After acute morphine treatments, KEPI is most prominently up-regulated in hippocampus (120 ± 16%, n = 5). After chronic morphine treatment, KEPI is up-regulated most significantly in thalamus (75.6 ± 6.2%, n = 6). In brains of homozygous μ receptor knockout mice, however, expression is no different from expression in wild type mice (Fig. 3B). Western analyses of iKEPI revealed bands with apparent mobilities of 45 and 37 kDa on SDS-PAGE bands. Immunoreactivities in both bands were blocked equally by preadsorption of the serum with the immunizing peptide. Immunoreactivities of both apparent mobilities were detected in rat cerebral cortex, midbrain, thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum, and heart. Faint 37 kDa bands were detected in proteins extracted from muscle, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and testis (Fig. 4). No significant cross-reactivities with the 20 or 23 kDa SDS-PAGE mobilities of CPI and PHI, respectively (11.Eto M. Karginov A. Brautigan D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16952-16957Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 26.Eto M. Ohmori T. Suzuki M. Furuya K. Morita F. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), were noted in these brain extracts. KEPI immunoreactivity was associated with membrane fractions and little with cytosolic fractions. The higher molecular mass 45-kDa immunoreactive species was much more prominent in the P2 crude synaptosomal fraction, whereas lower molecular mass 37-kDa species was found in the P3 crude microsomal fractions (Fig. 4). However, after prolonged storage in SDS sample buffer, much of the iKEPI in extracts from P2 fraction migrated at the 37 kDa position of the lower band (data not shown). Molecular masses observed in Western analyses could be higher than those calculated from KEPI peptide sequence lengths because of deviant SDS-PAGE migration of acidic polypeptides (27.Liu Q.R. Chan P.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and/or post-translational modifications of KEPI. Differential migration displayed by iKEPI extracted from different subcellular fractions supports substantial roles for post-translational modifications. A recombinant murine KEPI fusion protein consisting of KEPI fused to 43 pET30a vector amino acids including its His tag, thrombin recognition sequences, and enterokinase recognition sequences yielded a 32 kDa band after SDS-PAGE of extracts of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-induced expressing BL21 E. coli (Fig. 5, left). This was again larger than the 23-kDa unmodified mass predicted from the sequence as often found for acidic proteins. The heat stability of KEPI allowed cell extract boiling and HisTrap metal chelation chromatography, facilitating purification of this fusion protein to homogeneity (Fig. 5, right). Yields of His-KEPI reached as high as 10 mg of protein/liter of bacterial culture. Recombinant His-KEPI protein can be phosphorylated by purified rat brain PKC preparations. Under these conditions, recombinant protein was phosphorylated with apparent Km = 2.6 μm,Vmax = 37.8 nm/mg/min, and t1/2 of 20.7 min (Fig. 6A). At plateau time points, a near stoichiometric ratio of phosphorylation, 0.81 ± 0.12 mol of phosphorus/mol of His-KEPI was achieved. When the mobility of32P-labeled His-KEPI was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (Fig. 6B), a dominant 32 kDa32P-labeled band corresponding to His-KEPI was observed. Phospho-KEPI, produced by KEPI preincubation with PKC, inhibited the ability of rabbit muscle PP1α to dephosphorylate32P-labeled phosphorylase. This activity was inhibited by PKC-phosphorylated recombinant KEPI fusion protein with an IC50 of 2.7 ± 0.7 nm (Fig. 7A). Unphosphorylated KEPI could only inhibit rabbit muscle PP1α at much higher concentrations, displaying IC50 values of 1.8 μm. KEPI thus increased its inhibitory potency for PP1α more than 600-fold after phosphorylation by PKC. However, neither the phosphorylated nor unphosphorylated KEPI form was able to inhibit bovine kidney PP2A1-mediated dephosphorylation of the same 32P-labeled phosphorylase subst"

Compared with wild type control (lcat+/+), lcat−/− and lcat+/− mice showed a 4.9- (p = 0.003) and a 2.1-fold (p = 0.04) increase in plasma PL-F2-isoprostane levels, respectively. There was also a 3.6- (p < 0.0001) and 2.9-fold (p = 0.003) increase in the area under the curve for the aortic ring superoxide excursion by lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence. A comparison of apoE−/−xlcat+/+ mice with wild type control mice showed a more modest 2.1- (p = 0.04) and 2.2-fold (p < 0.00001) increase in these respective markers. Surprisingly, the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice showed a paradoxical normalization in both oxidation markers. Furthermore, by fast protein liquid chromatography separation, we observed an associated retention and redistribution of serum paraoxonase activities to the non-high density lipoprotein fractions in both the apoE−/−xlcat−/− and apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice.

The PON1 ko mice were found to develop accelerated atherosclerosis with and without the apoE deficiency background. We reported recently (6.Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L. Frei B. Suh J. Harmony J.A. Stuart W.D. Rubin E.M. Ng D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that LCAT-deficient mice have significantly lower levels of plasma PON1 arylesterase activities. A number of in vitro studies have also suggested that the LCAT enzyme itself may have intrinsic anti-oxidant properties (7.Subramanian V.S. Goyal J. Miwa M. Sugatami J. Akiyama M. Liu M. Subbaiah P.V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8.Vohl M.C. Neville T.A. Kumarathasan R. Braschi S. Sparks D.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5976-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It is therefore of considerable interest to understand better the in vivo effect of LCAT deficiency on oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in this mouse model. Vascular oxidant stress due to superoxide anion (O2⨪) and other reactive oxygen species has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis (9.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 10.Yokoyama M. Inoue N. Kawashima S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), possibly through being a major source of free radicals in the oxidative modification of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the arterial wall (11.Gorlach A. Brandes R.P. Nguyen K. Amidi M. Dehghani F. Busse R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Excessive production of vascular O2⨪ also attenuates the bioavailability of endothelial derived nitric oxide (NO), which may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis (12.O'Donnell V.B. Freeman B.A. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence, both in vivo and in vitro, suggests that NAD(P)H oxidase is a major contributor to the generation of O2⨪ anions in the vascular wall (9.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar, 13.Guzik T.J. West N.E. Black E. McDonald D. Ratnatunga C. Pillai R. Channon K.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to oxidized lipids, the NAD(P)H oxidase activity has also been shown to be modulated by a number of vasoactive peptides, cytokines, and growth factors (9.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). F2-isoprostanes are chemically stable prostaglandin isomers that result from non-enzymatic, free radical-mediated oxidative modification of arachidonic acid. These compounds can be found in tissues and many other body fluids including plasma and urine. These analytes have been shown to be excellent in vivo markers of oxidative stress both in human and in animal models (14.Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar). In this study, by using the LCAT ko mouse model, we tested the hypothesis that LCAT deficiency is associated with increased oxidative stress by measuring plasma levels of glycerophosphocholine-bound F2-isoprostanes (PL-F2-isoP) and vascular O2⨪ production using lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence (LDCL) in LCAT ko mice. We further studied the effect of LCAT deficiency on oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in apoE ko mice by cross-breeding the two strains. Lucigenin, NADH, CuSO4, and butylated hydroxytoluene were purchased from Sigma, and coelenterazine was purchased from Molecular Probes (Cedarlane Lab, Ontario, Canada). Free cholesterol, phospholipid, and cholesterol kits were from Wako (Neuss, Germany). Lcat−/− mice were created in Dr. Rubin's laboratory as reported previously (6.Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L.

ApoE−/−xlcat−/− mice were generated by first cross-breeding apoE−/− mice in C57BL/6 background (The Jackson Laboratory) with lcat−/− mice to yield apoE+/−xlcat+/−. Brother-sister matings of the F1 double heterozygous siblings were carried out. ApoE−/−xlcat+/− were selected by PCR screening for subsequent serial breeding for 5 generations. All studies were carried out with the mice being fed a chow diet, and littermates were used as controls. All mouse protocols were approved by the Animal Care Committee at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, Canada. Plasma lipid analyses were performed on mice 7–10 weeks of age. Plasma was obtained as described previously (6.Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L. Frei B. Suh J. Harmony J.A. Stuart W.D. Rubin E.M. Ng D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 1.019–1.063 g/ml (“LDL”) fraction was obtained through ultracentrifugation (16.Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) fractionation on total plasma and the LDL fraction was performed on a Superose 6HR column (10 mm × 30 cm) (Amersham Biosciences) (17.Ha Y.C. Barter P.J. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 341: 154-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Plasma and Superose fractions were analyzed on an RA-1000 (Bayer Diagnostics) using enzymatic assays for total cholesterol, triglycerides, glycerol blank, FC, and PL. HDL cholesterol was obtained from plasma after dextran sulfate precipitation (18.Warnick G.R. Benderson J.M. Albers J.J. Clin. Chem. 1982; 28: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1814) Google Scholar). Paraoxonase (PON1) activity in heparinized plasma and Superose fractions was measured as arylesterase activity in 7–10-week-old mice using phenylacetate as substrate as described previously (19.Gan K.N. Smolen A. Eckerson H.W. La Du B.N. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1991; 19: 100-106PubMed Google Scholar). Fasting blood from mice 8 to 12 weeks of age was obtained by tail bleed, and butylated hydroxytoluene was added to the plasma immediately after separation to a final concentration of 100 μm and frozen at −80 °C. The level of PL-F2-isoprostanes was determined by on-line normal phase high pressure liquid chromatography with on-line electrospray/mass spectrometry as described previously (20.Ravandi A. Kuksis A. Shaikh N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16494-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The LDCL method was modified from that of Pagano et al. (21.Pagano P.J. Ito Y. Tornheim K. Gallop P.M. Tauber A.I. Cohen R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H2274-H2280Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice 6–10 months of age were anesthetized with Avertin before isolation of the aortic segments, starting from the aortic root and typically ending just distal to the renal artery (wet weight 11–16 mg). Each segment was cut into 5-mm rings before placing in an opaque 96-well microtiter plate in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.5 with NADH at 100 μmfollowed by incubation at 37 °C under 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 30 min before counting with a Wallac Victor-II (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the luminometry mode. Lucigenin at a final concentration of 250 μm was added and luminescence count recorded at 1-min intervals for 30 min. Chemiluminescence is reported as count/mg relative to a reference sample of 14 mg of wet weight. To validate these data, coelenterazine at a final concentration of 10 μm was used in place of lucigenin. The 1.019–1.063 g/ml fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation of the pooled plasma from mice 6–10 weeks of age for the genotypes apoE−/−xlcat+/+ and apoE−/−xlcat−/− and pooled plasma from normolipidemic human subjects. This fraction was then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.5, for overnight. To induce in vitro oxidation, 300 μl of the LDL fraction was incubated with 5 μm of CuSO4 in phosphate-buffered saline at pH 7.5 for 30 h, and the degree of oxidation was monitored by absorbance at 234 nm. Mearsurement of aortic atherosclerotic lesions in mice was carried out by the en face method (22.Tangirala R.K. Rubin E.M. Palinski W. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2320-2328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Male mice in apoE ko background fed a chow diet were sacrificed at 8–9 months of age. Aortae were dissected out intact from the aortic root to the femoral bifurcation, fixed overnight with formalin, followed by staining with Oil Red-O. Digital images were obtained with a Nikon Coolpix 880 camera (Nikon, Ontario, Canada). The Scion imaging software (Scion Inc.) was used to compute the lesion area, and all results were means of triplicate measurements. The severity is expressed as percent surface occupied by Oil Red-O-stained lesions. Comparison of group mean and S.D. was by Student's t test. Pearson statistics were used to evaluate correlation and two-way ANOVA was used for evaluating gene-gene interaction using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego) and a two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ApoE−/−xlcat+/− parents were used to generate offsprings with genotypes apoE−/−xlcat+/+, apoE−/−xlcat+/−, and apoE−/−xlcat−/−. The double ko mice grew normally with no apparent physical defects. Lipoprotein analyses of the LCAT-deficient mice are summarized in Table I. The lipoprotein profile of the lcat+/+, lcat+/−, and lcat−/− mice agreed with those reported previously (15.Ng D.S. Francone O.L. Forte T.M. Zhang J. Haghpassand M. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15777-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In the apoE−/− background, LCAT deficiency preserved the severely elevated plasma cholesterol. We also observed an LCAT gene dose-dependent decrease in the FC/CE ratio with and without the apoE−/− background. Lipoprotein analyses on the FPLC fractions showed a preservation of the accumulation of “VLDL” fractions in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− and apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice in comparison with the apoE−/− xlcat+/+ control mice (Fig. 1). HDL-C was also severely reduced in apoE−/−xlcat−/− mouse plasma, but unlike the lcat+/− mice, its level was also markedly decreased in the apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice (Table I and Fig. 1). On the other hand, the IDL/LDL shoulder (fraction 8) showed a 23% reduction in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice compared with apoE−/−xlcat+/+ and apoE−/−xlcat+/− littermates (Fig. 1), consistent with the significant up-regulation of the LDL receptor found in LCAT ko mice (23.Lambert G. Sakai N. Vaisman B.L. Neufeld E.B. Marteyn B. Chan C.-C. Paigen B. Lupia E. Thomas A. Striker L.J. Blanchette-Mackie J. Csako G. Brady J.N. Costello R. Striker G.E. Remaley A.T. Brewer Jr., H.B.

Open table in a new tab The total plasma PON1 arylesterase activities in different genotype groups are shown in Fig. 2a. A 46.5% reduction in PON1 activities was noted in the lcat−/− mice as compared with those of lcat+/+ mice, in agreement with our previous observation (6.Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L. Frei B. Suh J. Harmony J.A. Stuart W.D. Rubin E.M. Ng D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its reduction in the lcat+/− mice was not significant, suggestive of an autosomal recessive pattern in relation to the lcat mutant allele, which mirrors that of the plasma HDL-C levels. On the contrary, despite significantly lower HDL-C levels in both apoE−/− xlcat+/− and apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, their total plasma PON1 activities were not significantly different from the apoE−/− xlcat+/+ control. Analysis of the PON1 activities in FPLC fractions showed that nearly half of the total plasma PON1 activity eluted in the non-HDL fractions of the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice. A lesser extent of redistribution was also observed in the plasma of apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice (Fig. 2b). Because nearly 90% of the plasma isoprostanes exist in esterified form bound to phospholipids (14.Roberts II, L.J. Morrow J.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 505-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (863) Google Scholar), the plasma level of F2-isoprostanes was determined by measuring the content of PL-F2-isoP for all six genotypic groups (Fig. 3). Compared with the wild type mice, plasma from lcat−/− mice showed a 4.9-fold increase (p = 0.003) in plasma PL-F2-isoP. The lcat+/− mice showed intermediate levels but were not statistically different from those of the lcat−/− mice. In contrast, apoE−/−xlcat+/+ mice showed a 2.1-fold increase (p = 0.04) in plasma PL-F2-isoP as compared with the wild type mice, in excellent agreement with the 2-fold increase in the plasma level of iPF2α-VI as reported previously (24.Pratico D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mouse plasma PL-F2-isoP level was normalized. It is also of interest to note that the PL-F2-isoP level of apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice was comparable with that of the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, suggestive of an autosomal dominant effect. We observed a comparable lag time between the LDL fraction from apoE−/− xlcat+/+ mice and that of a pooled normal human LDL. However apoE−/−xlcat−/− LDL showed a prolongation of the lag time by 60.0 min. The rate of rise of the absorbance and the level of inflection point were similar between the two mouse strains. Vascular ring O2⨪ production was determined using LDCL on all six genotypic groups of mice (Fig. 4). Compared with lcat+/+ mice, the AUC for lcat−/− mice was found to be increased 3.6-fold (p = 0.00006) and that for lcat+/− mice 2.9-fold (p = 0.003). Likewise, we also observed a 2.2-fold increase (p = 0.000001) in LDCL-AUC of the apoE−/−xlcat+/+ mice when compared with the lcat+/+ mice. Again, the LDCL-AUCs for the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice were paradoxically normalized (1.26-fold change from the lcat+/+ mice, p = 0.1), which paralleled the normalization of the plasma PL-F2-isoP in the same strain. The LDCL-AUC for apoE−/−xlcat+/− mice was found to be subnormal (0.6-fold, p = 0.01). This also correlates well with the normal PL-F2-isoprostane level observed in this same genotypic group as stated above. The validity of using lucigenin at high concentrations raised concern because of the potential for superoxide recycling, and this potential artifact is absent when using coelenterazine as a marker (25.Tarpey M.M. White C.R. Suarez E. Richardson G. Radi R. Freeman B.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1203-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). All but one genotype group of mice were evaluated using coelenterazine as a superoxide sensor with n ≥ 3 in each group. We observed a near-unity correlation (r2 = 0.9265, p = 0.00086) between the LDCL-AUC and coelenterazine-derived chemiluminescence-AUC, thus validating the use of lucigenin. Two-way ANOVA analyses on the six genotypic groups showed strong interaction between lcat and apoE alleles on LDCL-AUC, F2-isoP, and PON1 activities with their respective F values being 92.19 (p < 0.0001), 10.5 (p = 0.0003), and 22.73 (p < 0.0001). Correlation between LDCL-AUC and PL-F2-isoP showed an r2 = 0.921 (p = 0.0024), but the r2 for PON1 activity versus LDCL-AUC and PON1 versusPL-F2-isoP were 0.0582 and 0.1648, respectively, both being statistically insignificant. Aortic lesion quantification using the en face method showed a 52% reduction (3.62 ± 2.09% versus 7.44 ± 3.35%; p = 0.02) in lesion area in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice (n = 7) as compared with the apoE−/− xlcat+/+ control (n = 11). This is in agreement with that reported by Lambert et al. (23.Lambert G. Sakai N. Vaisman B.L. Neufeld E.B. Marteyn B. Chan C.-C. Paigen B. Lupia E. Thomas A. Striker L.J. Blanchette-Mackie J. Csako G. Brady J.N. Costello R. Striker G.E. Remaley A.T. Brewer Jr., H.B. Santamarina-Fojo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15090-15098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) despite a difference in genetic background. The apoE−/−xlcat+/− (n = 8) showed a 24% reduction but was not statistically significant from either of the other two groups (Fig. 5). In this paper, we report the observation of marked enhancement in oxidative stress in chow-fed lcat−/− mice using two independent measurements, namely plasma PL-F2-isoP level and aortic ring O2⨪ production. When bred into the apoE−/− mouse background, we observed a paradoxical normalization of the same oxidative markers. This paradoxical change was found to be associated with a retention and redistribution of PON1 arylesterase activities into the non-HDL fractions based on FPLC separation. Furthermore, the normalization of the oxidative markers in the apoE−/−xlcat −/− mice was also found to be associated with a significant reduction in atherosclerotic lesions in the male apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice as compared with its age- and sex-matched apoE−/−xlcat+/+ control. We present the first in vivo evidence showing a marked increase in plasma PL-F2-isoP level and aortic O2⨪ production (LDCL-AUC) in the lcat−/− mice. The increase is related to the lcat mutant allele in an autosomal dominant fashion, in association with an inverse trend in both HDL-C and PON1 activities, although the latter two are affected in an autosomal recessive fashion. Despite being severely hypolipidemic, the increases in both oxidation markers in the lcat−/− mice are substantially higher than those in the extremely hyperlipidemic apoE−/−xlcat+/+ mice. These data suggest that the enhanced oxidative stress in the lcat−/− mice is modulated by factors beyond plasma level of lipoproteins. On the one hand, the inverse relationship between these oxidative markers and plasma PON1 activities suggest that this circulating antioxidant likely plays an important role, consistent with the recent findings by Shih et al. (4.Shih D.M. Gu L. Xia Y.R. Navab M. Li W.F. Hama S. Castellani L.W. Furlong C.E. Costa L.G. Fogelman A.M. Lusis A.J. Nature. 1998; 394: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar,5.Shih D.M. Xia Y.R. Wang X.P. Miller E. Castellani L.W. Subbanagounder G. Cheroutre H. Faull K.F. Berliner J.A. Witztum J.L. Lusis A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17527-17535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). The diverging effect of the lcat mutant allele in the heterozygotes underscores the importance of additional modulating factors. In addition to PON1, several HDL-associated proteins have been found to have antioxidant properties, and it is conceivable that the marked reduction of HDL levels in the lcat−/− mice may also lower the activities of these proteins and contribute to the overall increase in the oxidative stress observed. Paraoxonase 3 (PON3) has recently been cloned in a number of species including human, rabbit, and mouse (26.Draganov D.I. Stetson P.L. Watsonm C.E. Billeckem S.S. La Du B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33435-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). This protein is expressed primarily in the liver and the kidney and circulates in association with HDL. In vitro studies suggest that PON3 is capable of not only inactivating the preformed oxidized LDL but also preventing their formation (27.Reddy S.T. Wadleigh D.J. Grijalva V. Ng C. Hama S. Gangopadhyay A. Shih D.M. Lusis A.J. Navab M. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 542-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Although its antioxidant effects have not been established in vivo, it is conceivable that the low HDL in the lcat−/− mice may be associated with a significant reduction in serum PON3 levels and activities, contributing to the marked increase in oxidative stress seen in the lcat−/− mice. Platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is a 45-kDa protein secreted primarily by macrophages and circulates in both LDL and HDL in humans but exclusively in HDL in mice. This enzyme has the ability to hydrolyze not only PAF but also oxidized phospholipids (28.Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17895-17898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Recent studies (29.Quarck R. De Geest B. Stengel D. Mertens A. Lox M. Theilmeier G. Michiels C. Raes M. Bult H. Collen D. Van Veldhoven P. Ninio E. Holvoet P. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2495-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) demonstrated that overexpression of circulating PAF-AH in apoE knockout mice results in a reduction in oxidized β-VLDL and atherosclerosis. We reported previously (6.Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Knoff L. Frei B. Suh J. Harmony J.A. Stuart W.D. Rubin E.M. Ng D.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1276-1283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that PAF-AH activity was significantly reduced in the lcat−/− mice. Although the in vivo effect of PAF-AH deficiency in mice has not yet been reported, it is conceivable that a reduced plasma level of PAF-AH activity may contribute to the overall oxidative stress. The lipid profiles of the apoE−/−xlcat+/− and apoE−/− xlcat−/− mice were both characterized by a preservation of the severe hyperlipidemia of the apoE−/−xlcat+/+ control. In the apoE ko background, the effect of lcat mutant allele on HDL-C, PON1 activities, and the oxidation markers are even more divergent. The lcat mutant gene dose leads to a lowering of HDL-C in an autosomal dominant fashion but has no effect on PON1 activity (Table I and Fig. 2). The surprising finding in the double ko mice is the paradoxical normalization of plasma PL-F2-isoP and aortic O2⨪ production in both apoE−/−xlcat+/− and apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice. Despite such dramatically discordant findings, the correlation between mean PL-F2-isoP and LDCL-AUC among the six genotypical groups is remarkably linear (r2 = 0.94, p = 0.0014). Another novel finding is the significant redistribution of PON1 activities into the non-HDL fractions in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, sustaining the total PON1 activities. Previous studies (30.Durrington P.N. Mackness B. Mackness M.I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 473-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 31.James R.W. Blatter Garin M.C.

Atherosclerosis. 1998; 139: 77-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in human subjects with a variety of HDL deficiency states, excluding LCAT-deficient subjects, failed to document redistribution of PON1 activities into the non-HDL fractions. A redistribution of PON1 arylesterase activity to the non-HDL particles may be a unique feature of complete LCAT deficiency. A recent study by Sorenson et al. (32.Sorenson R.C. Bisgaier C.L. Aviram M. Hsu C. Billecke S. La Du B.N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2214-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PON1 can bind to PL vesicles via its hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequence peptide and remains active enzymatically without apoAI. The authors further demonstrated that HDL-associated PON1 can be transferred to these PL vesicles. The physical characteristics of such synthetic vesicles are not dissimilar to that of lipoprotein X (LpX). In our apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, we isolated LpX on the basis of an identification of an FC-, PL-rich, and CE-poor VLDL-like Superose peak in the 1.019–1.063 g/ml plasma fraction (33.Elferink R.P. Ottenhoff R. van Marle J. Frijters C.M. Smith A.J. Groen A.K. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1749-1757Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this plasma fraction, a small but definite quantity of PON1 activity co-eluted with this peak. However, inconsistent recovery of PON1 activity after ultracentrifugation precluded a more quantitative measurement. For the same reason, current data do not exclude association of PON1 with other non-HDL lipoprotein classes. Nonetheless, the redistribution of PON1 observed should be considered as one of the most biologically plausible explanations for the paradoxical normalization of oxidative stress in the double knockout mice. Similarly, redistribution of PON3 and/or PAF-AH in LCAT-deficient mice should also be considered. In the case of PON3, a redistribution of the protein to non-HDL particles has not been reported. Due to the lack of a specific assay for murine plasma PON3 (26.Draganov D.I. Stetson P.L. Watsonm C.E. Billeckem S.S. La Du B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33435-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), this possibility cannot be determined with certainty in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice. In humans, it is the PAF-AH that is associated with circulating LDL that is biologically active. It has been shown that human PAF-AH associates with the C terminus portion of apoB, and the sequences mediating this binding are altered in murine PAF-AH, consistent with its absence from murine apoB lipoproteins (34.Stafforini D.M. Tjoelker L.W. McCormick S.P. Vaitkus D. McIntyre T.M. Gray P.W. Young S.G. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7018-7024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It is therefore unlikely that PAF-AH would associate with non-HDL in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice. The mechanism by which the non-HDL-associated PON1 may impart antioxidative action is unclear. The protective role of PON1 against Cu2+-induced oxidation of LDL has been well established (26.Draganov D.I. Stetson P.L. Watsonm C.E. Billeckem S.S. La Du B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33435-33442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 35.Aviram M. Billecke S. Sorenson R. Bisgaier C. Newton R. Rosenblat M. Ergoul J. Hsu C. Dunlop C. La Du B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). We observed a resistance of the 1.019–1.063 g/ml plasma fraction from the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice to Cu2+-induced oxidation in conjunction with the detection of PON1 activities co-eluting with LpX in the same fraction. This is consistent with the notion that the vesicle (LpX)-associated PON1 retains not only its arylesterase activity but also its antioxidative properties. PON1 activity has been detected in interstitial fluid (36.Mackness M.I. Mackness B. Arrol S. Wood G. Bhatnagar D. Durrington P.N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a site where HDL-associated PON1 is most likely to impart its anti-oxidative actions. It is conceivable that the non-HDL-associated PON1 may also enter the interstitial space, reducing the degree of oxidative modification in the vessel wall. Because oxidized lipids have been shown to stimulate the NADPH oxidase system (9.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar), this may explain the observed paradoxical normalization of O2⨪ in the apoE−/− xlcat−/− mouse aortae. The two oxidative markers, mean LDCL-AUC and PL-F2-isoP, are both inversely related to mean plasma PON1 activities among the six groups. However, based on the opposite effects of the two apoE alleles on the lcat heterozygotes, the correlations between them are poor as expected. This is largely the result of the diverge influence of apoE genotype on the lcat heterozygotes as reflected by the strong gene-gene interactions based on the two-way ANOVA analyses. Exclusion of these two heterozygous groups would have unmasked a remarkably linear inverse relationship (r2 > 0.85 and p< 0.05) in both cases, underscoring the complexity of gene-gene interactions on oxidative stress in heterozygous LCAT deficiency. In addition, the PON1 in the HDL and non-HDL fractions are bound to very different lipoproteins, and their antioxidant activities may be differentially modulated, further contributing to the poor correlation. Recent studies suggest that the NAD(P)H oxidase system is a major source of arterial O2⨪ (13.Guzik T.J. West N.E. Black E. McDonald D. Ratnatunga C. Pillai R. Channon K.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: E85-E90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and oxidized LDL has been shown to be one of the potent stimulators of this enzyme (9.Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 494-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2625) Google Scholar). The strong correlation between PL-F2-isoP and aortic O2⨪ production in the LCAT-deficient mice therefore suggests a direct mechanistic link. It is conceivable that aortic vessel wall NAD(P)H oxidase activity and circulating oxidized lipids may be fueling a self-perpetuating cycle, establishing a unique steady state for each genotype. The resistance of the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mouse LDL to Cu2+-induced oxidation may have contributed to the attenuation of the fueling of this cycle and the normalization of the oxidative markers in these mice. Oxidative stress has been shown to be important in mouse models of atherosclerosis. In apoE ko mice, oral supplementation with vitamin E resulted in concomitant reductions in plasma, urinary, and arterial isoprostane levels in association with a significant reduction in aortic atherosclerosis, without altering the plasma cholesterol level (24.Pratico D. Tangirala R.K. Rader D.J. Rokach J. FitzGerald G.A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In the present report, our finding of a significant reduction in spontaneous aortic atherosclerosis in male apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, when compared with that of age- and gender-matched apoE−/−xlcat+/+ mice, is in agreement with Lambert et al. (23.Lambert G. Sakai N. Vaisman B.L. Neufeld E.B. Marteyn B. Chan C.-C. Paigen B. Lupia E. Thomas A. Striker L.J. Blanchette-Mackie J. Csako G. Brady J.N. Costello R. Striker G.E. Remaley A.T.

Although we found a 23% reduction in plasma IDL and LDL levels in our apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice, the extent is unlikely to account completely for the normalization of the aortic O2⨪ production. Our data therefore suggest that the increased resistance of the LDL to oxidative modification in the apoE−/−xlcat−/− mice is likely important for the observed reduction in atherosclerotic lesions, and this may in turn be a result of the retention and redistribution of PON1 in the hyperlipidemic LCAT-deficient mice. Furthermore, the non-linearity in the association between plasma PON1 activities and the oxidative stress markers in the heterozygous LCAT-deficient mice suggests that the role of the antioxidants, including PON1, in atherosclerosis is complex in LCAT deficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2045941756,"Rab3A, a member of the Rab3 small G protein family, regulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. The cyclical activation and inactivation of Rab3A are essential for the Rab3A action in exocytosis. GDP-Rab3A is activated to GTP-Rab3A by Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein (Rab3 GEP), and GTP-Rab3A is inactivated to GDP-Rab3A by Rab3 GTPase-activating protein (Rab3 GAP). It remains unknown how or in which step of the multiple exocytosis steps these regulators are activated and inactivated. We isolated here a novel protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP and GAP by their respective antibodies from the crude synaptic vesicle fraction of rat brain. The protein, named rabconnectin-3, bound both Rab3 GEP and GAP. The cDNA of rabconnectin-3 was cloned from a human cDNA library and its primary structure was determined. Human rabconnectin-3 consisted of 3,036 amino acids and showed a calculated M r of 339,753. It had 12 WD domains. Tissue and subcellular distribution analyses in rat indicated that rabconnectin-3 was abundantly expressed in the brain where it was enriched in the synaptic vesicle fraction. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that rabconnectin-3 was concentrated on synaptic vesicles at synapses. These results indicate that rabconnectin-3 serves as a scaffold molecule for both Rab3 GEP and GAP on synaptic vesicles. Rab3A, a member of the Rab3 small G protein family, regulates Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. The cyclical activation and inactivation of Rab3A are essential for the Rab3A action in exocytosis. GDP-Rab3A is activated to GTP-Rab3A by Rab3 GDP/GTP exchange protein (Rab3 GEP), and GTP-Rab3A is inactivated to GDP-Rab3A by Rab3 GTPase-activating protein (Rab3 GAP). It remains unknown how or in which step of the multiple exocytosis steps these regulators are activated and inactivated. We isolated here a novel protein that was co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP and GAP by their respective antibodies from the crude synaptic vesicle fraction of rat brain. The protein, named rabconnectin-3, bound both Rab3 GEP and GAP. The cDNA of rabconnectin-3 was cloned from a human cDNA library and its primary structure was determined. Human rabconnectin-3 consisted of 3,036 amino acids and showed a calculated M r of 339,753. It had 12 WD domains. Tissue and subcellular distribution analyses in rat indicated that rabconnectin-3 was abundantly expressed in the brain where it was enriched in the synaptic vesicle fraction. Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy revealed that rabconnectin-3 was concentrated on synaptic vesicles at synapses. These results indicate that rabconnectin-3 serves as a scaffold molecule for both Rab3 GEP and GAP on synaptic vesicles. GDP dissociation inhibitor GDP/GTP exchange protein GTPase-activating protein antibody the crude synaptic vesicle fraction glutathione S-transferase amino acid(s) Rab3A is a member of the Rab3 family, along with Rab3B, -3C, and -3D, and plays a key regulatory role in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter (for reviews, see Refs. 1Takai Y.

The process of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter consists of several steps: translocation of synaptic vesicles from the reserve pool to the active zone of the presynaptic plasma membrane where a Ca2+ channel localizes, docking of the vesicles to the active zone, transition from the docking to the priming of the vesicles in the readily releasable pool, and fusion of the vesicles with the membrane induced by Ca2+ influx (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cell. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Darchen F. Goud B.

The Rab3A gene knockout mouse analysis has revealed two actions of Rab3A: it facilitates the translocation and docking of synaptic vesicles to the presynaptic plasma membrane (4Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. De Takei K. Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), and it prevents Ca2+-triggered fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane (5Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). The Rab3 family members are regulated by three regulators: Rab GDI1 and Rab3 GEP and GAP (1Takai Y. Sasaki T. Shirataki H. Nakanishi H. Genes Cell. 1996; 1: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 2Darchen F. Goud B. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 375-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 3Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). Rab3 GEP and GAP are specific for the Rab3 family members, but Rab GDI is active on all the Rab family members. The cyclical activation and inactivation of Rab3A by the action of these regulators are essential for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. A current model for the mode of action of these regulators is as follows: GDP-Rab3A is kept in the cytosol in a complex with Rab GDI. This complex is recruited to synaptic vesicles where GDP-Rab3A is activated to GTP-Rab3A by the action of Rab3 GEP with the help of another unidentified molecule, such as GDI displacement factor (6Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Svejstrup A.B. Pfeffer S.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 76-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) or Rab recycling factor (7Luan P. Balch W.E. Emr S.D. Burd C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14806-14817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) proposed for other vesicle trafficking systems. GTP-Rab3A binds to its two downstream effectors: rabphilin-3 and Rim localized on the vesicles and the active zone, respectively. Before or after the fusion step, GTP-Rab3A in a complex with the effectors is inactivated to GDP-Rab3A by the action of Rab3 GAP. GDP-Rab3A forms a complex with Rab GDI, resulting in the translocation from the vesicles to the cytosol. Rat Rab3 GEP consists of 1,602 aa and shows a calculated M r of 177,982 (8Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Human Rab3 GAP consists of one catalytic subunit (p130) and one noncatalytic subunit (p150): the catalytic and noncatalytic subunits consist of 981 and 1,393 aa and show calculated M r values of 110,521 and 156,081, respectively (9Fukui K.

In this model, however, it still remains unknown how or in which step of the multiple exocytosis steps these regulators are activated and inactivated. To address these issues, we attempted here to isolate a protein(s) that was co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP and/or GAP by their respective Abs from CSV of rat brain and identified a novel protein, named rabconnectin-3, which bound both Rab3 GEP and GAP. We describe here the isolation and characterization of rabconnectin-3 and discuss its possible function in Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter. GST fusion proteins of rabconnectin-3 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by use of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The fusion proteins contained the following aa: GST-rabconnectin-3-1, aa 704–1033; and GST-rabconnectin-3–2, aa 1780–1971. Recombinant Rab3 GEP was expressed in Sf9 cells transfected with baculovirus carrying the full-length cDNA of Rab3 GEP and purified by use of Mono Q and Superdex 200 columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) as described previously (8Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). His6-tagged Rab3 GAP p130 and p150 were expressed inE. coli and purified by use of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) (9Fukui K. Sasaki T. Imazumi K. Matsuura Y. Nakanishi H. Takai Y.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab3 GEP and anti-Rab3 GAP p130 and p150 Abs were prepared as described previously (11Oishi H. Sasaki T. Nagano F. Ikeda W. Ohya T. Wada M. Ide N. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J.

Rat polyclonal anti-rabconnectin-3 Ab1 and Ab2 were raised against GST-rabconnectin-3-1 and -2, respectively, and affinity-purified with each antigen covalently coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Mouse monoclonal anti-Rab3A and rabbit polyclonal anti-rabphilin-3 Abs were prepared as described previously (12Mizoguchi A. Kim S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons were prepared as described previously (14Brewer G.J. Torricelli J.R. Evege E.K. Price P.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 35: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). CSV of rat brain was prepared as described previously (15Mizoguchi A. Ueda T. Ikeda K. Shiku H. Mizoguti H. Takai Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1989; 5: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To identify a Rab3 GEP- and/or GAP-binding protein(s), CSV was incubated at 4 °C for 90 min in Buffer A (20 mm Tris/Cl at pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.8%n-octylglucopyranoside) or Buffer B (20 mmTris/Cl at pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40), followed by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 60 min. The supernatant in Buffer A or B (4 mg of protein each) was incubated at 4 °C overnight with the anti-Rab3 GEP or anti-Rab3 GAP p150 Ab immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (40 μl of wet volume), respectively. After the beads were extensively washed with the respective buffers, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in an SDS sample buffer (60 mm Tris/Cl at pH 6.7, 3% SDS, 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining with silver. The protein band corresponding to p340 (rabconnectin-3) was cut out from the gel and digested with a lysyl endopeptidase, and the digested peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid column chromatography as described previously (13Imazumi K. Sasaki T. Takahashi K. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1409-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The aa sequences of the peptides were determined with a peptide sequencer (Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencing system). Three sets of oligonucleotide primers were designed as follows: AGA TTA CAT CCT GAT CCT TTC CTG CGT/TTC ATC TAA GGC ACT GTC GTG ATC TTC, GTG TGG CAT GTG AAG TAT TTG GAT GAA/ATC CAC TAC AGC TTG ATA GAG TCT CAG, and ATG CAT CTG CAT CAG GTC CTC/CAA AAG ACA GTC TTC TGG TAA. Three cDNA fragments were amplified with these primers from a human brain cDNA (CLONTECH). A human brain cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) was screened by use of these cDNA fragments as probes. DNA sequencing was performed by the dideoxynucleotide termination method using a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer, PE Biosystems). The extract of CSV (0.5 mg of protein) was prepared with Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and mixed with recombinant Rab3 GEP, His6-tagged Rab3 GAP p130, or p150 (10 pmol each). The sample mixed with Rab3 GEP was then incubated at 4 °C for 120 min with the anti-rabconnectin-3 Ab2 immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (20 μl of wet volume) through a goat anti-rat IgG Fc Ab (Chemicon) in Buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The sample mixed with Rab3 GAP p130 or p150 was similarly incubated with the anti-rabconnectin-3 Ab2 immobilized on protein G-Sepharose beads (20 μl of wet volume). After the beads were extensively washed with the same buffer, the bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in the SDS sample buffer. The sample was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting.

Protein concentrations were determined with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein as described previously (20Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). To first identify a Rab3 GEP-binding protein(s), Rab3 GEP was immunoprecipitated by its Ab from the extract of CSV of rat brain and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining. Four major proteins with molecular mass values of 340 kDa (p340), 200 kDa (p200), 160 kDa (p160), and 60 kDa (p60) were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 Aa). Western blot analysis showed that of the four proteins, p200 was Rab3 GEP. The protein staining did not reveal the presence of Rab3A in the immunoprecipitate, because the IgG light chain disturbed the detection of Rab3A (data not shown). However, Western blot analysis showed that Rab3A was faintly co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP. The amount of Rab3A immunoprecipitated was estimated to be less than 10% of that of Rab3 GEP immunoprecipitated. To then identify a Rab3 GAP-binding protein(s), Rab3 GAP was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Rab3 GAP p150 Ab from the same fraction, and the immunoprecipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by protein staining. Four major proteins with molecular mass values of 340 kDa (p340), 150 kDa (p150), 130 kDa (p130), and 90 kDa (p90) were immunoprecipitated (Fig. 1 Ab). Western blot analysis showed that of the four proteins, p150 and p130 were the noncatalytic and catalytic subunits of Rab3 GAP, respectively. Rab3A was not detected in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). The p340 protein co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP and the p340 co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GAP showed apparently a similar molecular mass. The bands of these two proteins were separately cut out from the gel and digested with a lysyl endopeptidase. The peptides of each protein were separated by C18 reverse phase high pressure liquid column chromatography. The same peptide peaks were observed for both the p340 proteins, and the aa sequences of the seven peptides of each p340 protein were determined. The same aa sequences were obtained. These results indicated that the same protein was co-immunoprecipitated with Rab3 GEP and GAP. Computer search with these aa sequences of p340 against GenBankTM data bases revealed that two of the seven peptides were included in the aa sequence deduced from a human brain cDNA fragment (KIAA0856, GenBankTM accession number AB020663). All of them were included in the aa sequence deduced from two overlapping BAC clones of the human genome (GenBankTM accession numbersAC020892 and AC066613). On the basis of this information, we screened a human brain cDNA library and isolated overlapping clones 1–3 (see Fig. 2 B). These three clones with the KIAA0856 cDNA were aligned, and the complete nucleotide sequence was determined. The sequence contained an initiation codon downstream of an in-frame stop codon in the 5′ region and an in-frame stop codon in the 3′ region, indicating that this sequence encoded the entire coding region. All the aa sequences of the peptides were included in this sequence. The complete nucleotide sequence encoded a protein with 3,036 aa and a calculated M r of 339,753 (GenBankTM accession number AF389880) (Fig.2 A). We named this protein rabconnectin-3. Rabconnectin-3 contained 12 WD domains (Fig. 2 B). WD domains are found in a variety of proteins and likely to be responsible for protein-protein interactions (21Neer E.J. Schmidt C.J. Nambudripad R. Smith T.F. Nature. 1994; 371: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Rabconnectin-3 showed a domain structure similar to that of DMXL-1, which has 10 WD domains. DMXL-1 has been identified as a WD domain protein, but its function is unknown (22Kraemer C. Enklaar T. Zabel B. Schmidt E.R. Genomics. 2000; 64: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). When rabconnectin-3 was immunoprecipitated from the extract of CSV by the anti-rabconnectin-3 Ab, neither Rab3 GEP, Rab3 GAP p130, p150, nor Rab3A was detected in the immunoprecipitate (data not shown). This might be just due to the low amounts of Rab3 GEP and GAP in this fraction (see Fig. 3 B). We then mixed the recombinant sample of Rab3 GEP, Rab3 GAP p130, or p150 with the extract of CSV, and rabconnectin-3 was immunoprecipitated. Rab3 GEP and Rab3 GAP p150, but not Rab3 GAP p130, were co-immunoprecipitated with rabconnectin-3 (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that rabconnectin-3 binds both Rab3 GEP and Rab3 GAP p150. Western blot analysis of various rat tissues revealed that rabconnectin-3 was abundantly expressed in the brain (Fig. 3 A). The subcellular distribution analysis in rat brain revealed that rabconnectin-3 was highly concentrated in CSV (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, both Rab3 GEP and GAP were mainly recovered in the synaptic soluble fraction, whereas rabphilin-3 was highly concentrated in CSV. This subcellular distribution of these proteins is consistent with our previous results (10Nagano F. Sasaki T. Fukui K. Asakura T. Imazumi K. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24781-24785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 11Oishi H. Sasaki T. Nagano F. Ikeda W. Ohya T. Wada M. Ide N. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that rabconnectin-3 was concentrated in the synaptic regions of mouse hippocampus and primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig.4, Aa and Ab). Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that rabconnectin-3 was concentrated on synaptic vesicles of primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that rabconnectin-3 is associated with synaptic vesicles at synapses. We have identified here a novel protein that binds both Rab3 GEP and GAP and named it rabconnectin-3. Tissue distribution analysis of rabconnectin-3 in rat has revealed that it is abundantly expressed in the brain. Subcellular distribution analysis of rabconnectin-3 in rat brain and immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy of mouse hippocampus and primary cultured rat hippocampal neurons have revealed that it is associated with synaptic vesicles at synapses. Rabconnectin-3 has no transmembrane segment and is extracted from the vesicles by a detergent (data not shown), suggesting that it is a peripheral membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. Taken together, rabconnectin-3 may serve as a scaffold protein of Rab3 GEP and GAP on synaptic vesicles. In contrast to rabconnectin-3, subcellular distribution analysis indicates that Rab3 GEP and GAP are mainly recovered in the synaptic soluble fraction and partly associated with synaptic vesicles. The exact reason for the different distribution of these proteins is currently unknown, but when Rab3 GEP and GAP activate and inactivate Rab3A, respectively, in the process of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter, these regulators may be translocated from the cytosol to synaptic vesicles through their binding to rabconnectin-3. After Rab3 GEP and GAP finish their functions, these regulators may be released from rabconnectin-3, resulting in the translocation from the vesicles to the cytosol. The binding of Rab3 GEP and GAP to rabconnectin-3 may be regulated by modifications of some of these three proteins, such as phosphorylation. It is of crucial importance to know whether rabconnectin-3 affects Rab3 GEP or GAP activity. To address this issue, we attempted to make recombinant proteins of the full length of rabconnectin-3 in E. coli, Sf9 cells, and COS7 cells, but we have not yet succeeded in preparing any recombinant protein. We cannot conclude from the present immunoprecipitation analysis whether Rab3 GEP and GAP directly or indirectly bind to rabconnectin-3, because we do not have the pure sample of rabconnectin-3. We have shown here that Rab3A is co-immunoprecipitated by the anti-Rab3 GEP Ab, but not by the anti-Rab3 GAP p150 or anti-rabconnectin-3 Ab, suggesting that Rab3A binds to Rab3 GEP. Thus, rabconnectin-3 directly or indirectly binds Rab3A and its regulators, raising a possibility that rabconnectin-3 additionally binds Rab GDI, rabphilin-3, and Rim directly or indirectly and functions as a core protein scaffolding Rab3A and its related molecules. Rabconnectin-3 may also bind a putative GDI displacement or Rab recycling factor for Rab3A. It is important to clarify the molecular linkage among rabconnectin-3, Rab3A, and its related molecules in more detail for our understanding of Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitter."

It has been shown that CFTR is present in endosomes of stably transfected Swiss 3T3 and T84 cells, which normally express CFTR (15.Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C149-C156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of CFTR on the plasma membrane and organelles of the secretory pathway, which communicate with the endocytic pathway, prompted us to re-examine potential consequences in CF on the pH of endocytic organelles by specific targeting of pH-sensitive GFP (18.Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) to a defined endocytic compartment. Here we show that cellubrevin-labeled endosomes are hyperacidified in CF lung epithelial cells and that the pH of the recycling endosome depends on CFTR and its effects on sodium transport. In addition, we show physiological defects in the function of the endocytic pathway in CF, as recycling of receptor-mediated endocytic tracers (transferrin) is affected in CF lung epithelial cells.

C38 and S9 are derivatives of IB3-1 cells and are stably transfected with a functionalCFTR corrected for chloride conductance (22.Egan M. Flotte T. Afione S. Solow R. Zeitlin P.L. Carter B.J. Guggino W.B. Nature. 1992; 358: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The physiological levels of expression of CFTR and its functionality have been established previously for C38 cells (22.Egan M. Flotte T. Afione S. Solow R. Zeitlin P.L. Carter B.J. Guggino W.B. Nature. 1992; 358: 581-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in LHC-8 media (BIOSOURCE Int., Rockville, MD), 10% fetal bovine serum, and 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-pHluorin GFP DNA constructs were from J. Rothman (18.Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). IB3-1 cells and its derivatives were seeded at 105 cells/ml on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates. Cells were transfected with 1 μg/ml DNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. CFT1 cells and their derivatives were seeded at 105 cells/ml on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates and grown in the medium without cholera toxin. Cells were transfected with GenePorter (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA) with 2.5 μg/ml DNA for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Transfected cells were mounted in a perfusion chamber after 48 h of expression (Harvard Instruments, Holliston, MA) set at 37 °C for live microscopy or otherwise processed for colocalization studies. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out using an Olympus IX-70 microscope and Olympix KAF1400 CCD camera (LSR, Olympus, Melville, NY). The ratio of emission at 508 nm upon excitation at 410 versus 470 nm was obtained using the previously described (18.Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar) filter sets (Chroma Technology Corp., Brattleboro, VT) mounted in a Sutter filter wheel (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA) and controlled by the Merlin program (version 1.89, LSR, Olympus, Melville, NY). For the pH standard curve, two types of calibrations were carried out. (i) Cells transfected with GPI-pHluorin GFP were mounted in a perfusion chamber and incubated in buffer A (25 mm HEPES (pH changing from 7.4 to 5.5), 119 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 30 mm glucose) at 37 °C. Fluorescence images were taken upon excitation at 410 and 470 nm (six consecutive exposures). Three regions of interest were selected, and the standard curve was plotted as averaged 410/470 ratio values for a given buffer pH. (ii) At the end of experiments, the pH gradient was collapsed by incubating cells in 10 μm monensin and 10 μm nigericin for 30 min at 37 °C in buffer A at pH 7.4 or 5.5, and ratios were recorded for internal standards. Sample pH was determined the same way as for the external standard curve. IB3-1 and derivative cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well plates at the density described above. After 72 h cells were washed and incubated with the water-soluble, membrane-impermeant, pH-sensitive ratiometric probe 8-hydroxypyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid 5 mm (HPTS, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C. Cells were washed after 10 and 60 min, and the ratio of fluorescence emission at 508 nm was determined upon altered excitation at 410 and 470 nm. For H+-ATPase inhibition, cells were incubated with 100 nm bafilomycin A (Sigma) in buffer A at pH 7.4 for 2.5 h at 37 °C. For inhibition of sodium channels, 100 μm amiloride (Sigma) was added in buffer A at pH 7.4 for 60 or 120 min at 37 °C. For Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition, cells were incubated with 10 μm acetylstrophanthidin in buffer A for 60 min, and pH was measured as above. In experiments where CFTR folding and trafficking were rescued (23.Egan M.E. Schwiebert E.M. Guggino W.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C243-C251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by low temperature, mutant IB3-1 cells were grown at 26 °C, 5% CO2 for 40 h on glass coverslips. Organellar pH was determined using ratiometric GFP-pHluorin as described in sections above. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA; gift from Triple Crown America Inc., Perkasie, PA) was used as an agent that promotes CFTR trafficking and rescue of its function (24.Rubenstein R.C. Zeitlin P.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 278: C259-C267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,25.Zeitlin P.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). IB3-1 cells were grown in the presence of 2.5 mm 4-PBA at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 40 h. Cells were then subjected to ratiometric determination of organellar pH as described above. Cells were grown for 48 h in complete LHC-8 media in the presence of 0.1–1.0 mmNH4Cl (from Sigma) at 37 °C in 5% CO2, and pH measurements were carried out as describe above. For localization studies with fluorescently labeled transferrin, IB3-1 cells and derivatives grown on glass slides were transfected with cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP as described above. After 48 h of expression, cells were incubated for 30 min in DMEM (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), 0.2% BSA (Sigma) at 37 °C followed by a change of medium and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. 20 μg/ml human transferrin conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes) in DMEM, 0.2% BSA was added for 30 min at 4 °C followed by three washes and incubation with DMEM, 0.2% BSA at 37 °C for 15 and 120 min. When indicated, cells were treated with 20 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 60 min following a 120-min treatment with transferrin. Samples were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, 5% sucrose for 10 min at room temperature, mounted with PermaFluor (Shandon, Pittsburgh, PA), and examined by fluorescence microscopy using a 570/20 excitation filter and a dichroic mirror/emitter cube set 8300 (Chroma Technology Corp.). For localization studies with CFTR-GFP and transferrin, IB3-1 cells and derivatives were transfected with CFTR-GFP. Transfection and transferrin incubation were as described above. For localization studies with α2,6-sialyltransferase, cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and Myc-tagged α2,6-sialyltransferase DNA using 10 μl of Lipofectin. After 48 h of expression, cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% saponin for 5 min. Mouse monoclonal antibody (9E10) against c-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was followed by goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes). Glass slides were mounted using PermaFluor and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy using a 570/20 excitation filter and a dichroic mirror/emitter cube set 8300. For localization studies with dextran-Texas Red, cellubrevin-pHluorin-transfected IB3-1 cells and IB3-1 derivatives were incubated with 10 μg/ml dextran-Texas Red followed by three washes. Cells were either fixed or live sequences were recorded immediately after removal of dextran-Texas Red every 30 s for 30 min using a monochromator excitation light source and emission filter sets on a microscope and camera controlled by TILLvisTRAC, version 3.3 (T.I.L.L. Vision Photonics, GMBH). For localization studies of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and EEA-1, IB3-1 and derivative cells were transfected with cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP. EEA1 was visualized using primary human anti-EEA1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and secondary Alexa 568-conjugated antibody. Transferrin recycling was carried out as described previously (16.Gibson G.A. Hill W.G. Weisz O.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1088-C1099Crossref Google Scholar). IB3-1 cells and their derivatives were incubated with 125I-labeled transferrin for 45 min in DMEM, 0.2% BSA at 37 °C. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold DMEM, 0.2% BSA. The last wash was taken as 0 time point. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, and medium was collected and replaced with fresh DMEM, 0.2% BSA for a further 45 min. Medium was collected, and cells were lysed to establish 100% of counts. Samples were counted in a γ-counter (Beckman, Brae, CA) and expressed as % transferrin recycled at a given time point. The assay was carried out according to Li and co-workers (26.Li G. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24475-24480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Li G. D'Souza-Schorey C.

Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 5 × 105/well at 24 h prior to assay. After being washed in serum-free DMEM, cells were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with either DMEM or 100 ng/ml wortmannin in DMEM. After washing, cells were incubated with 5 mg/ml HRP in DMEM, 0.2% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C. Uptake was stopped by washing with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% BSA. Cells were lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysate was added to O-phenylenediamine solution (HRP substrate) in a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 mH2SO4, and A490was measured using a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-1601, Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). Protein concentration of the lysate was determined by BCA reaction (Pierce), and uptake was expressed asA490/mg protein. All statistical analyses were carried out using Fisher's Protected LSD post hoc test (analysis of variance) (SuperANOVA v1.11, Abacus Concepts, Inc., Berkeley, CA). In this study, we employed the recently developed pH-sensitive GFP (pHluorin GFP) system for ratiometric determination of the lumenal pH in intracellular organelles (18.Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Two pHluorin GFP fusion constructs were used (Fig. 1, a–h), one with GPI-pHluorin GFP and another with (endosomal v-SNARE) cellubrevin (18.Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). GPI-pHluorin GFP is expected to result in the exposure of pHluorin GFP on the plasma membrane to the extracellular fluid. The cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP fusion has GFP exposed luminally in the intracellular compartments containing cellubrevin. The endosomal (cellubrevin) and plasma membrane (GPI)-targeted pHluorin GFP probes were transfected into well characterized human bronchial epithelial cells (21.Zeitlin P.L. Lu L. Rhim J. Cutting G.

These cells have been used as standard cell lines to model the effects of CFTR (6.Schwiebert E.M. Egan M.E. Hwang T.H. Fulmer S.B. Allen S.S. Cutting G.R. Guggino W.B.

The plasma membrane localization of GPI-pHluorin GFP was demonstrated by responsiveness of GFP fluorescence to pH changes of the external buffer. Fig. 1, a–d, displays the fluorescence appearance of GPI-pHluorin GFP at pH 7.4 and 5.5. The cells expressing GPI-pHluorin GFP were used to generate a standard curve (Fig. 1i). All cells showed identical dependence of the GPI-pHluorin GFP fluorescence on pH of the external buffer. In addition to the plasma membrane labeling, as evidenced in Fig. 1,a–d, all cells transfected with GPI-pHluorin GFP showed a perinuclear fluorescence corresponding to a lipid raft recycling compartment, recently described by Lippincott-Schwartz and colleagues (29.Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Based on our observations, this compartment responds to external buffer pH (Fig. 1, a–d), most likely because of the previously described rapid cycling of these membranes in constant communication with plasma membrane (29.Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). GPI-pHluorin GFP fluorescence was not dependent on changes in concentration of other ions in the medium (e.g. sodium; data not shown). There were no differences in fluorescence ratios obtained with GPI-pHluorin GFP in IB3-1, C38, and S9 cells. Localization of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP was examined in both CF and CFTR-corrected cells by fluorescence microscopy using EEA1 antibodies, Texas Red-conjugated endocytic tracers. First, the cells were allowed to endocytose fluorescent transferrin, which was followed by chasing this marker of receptor-mediated endocytosis into the pericentriolar/paranuclear recycling compartment. This resulted in a significant colocalization of transferrin with cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP fluorescence in the transfected cells as evidenced by a similar overall organellar distribution (Fig. 2,a–c, IB3-1 cells; d–f, CFTR-corrected S-9 cells). Both the CF and CFTR-corrected cells showed similar overall organellar distribution. The colocalization of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and transferrin was not absolute in either cell line, as some of the cellubrevin- and transferrin-labeled profiles did not fully overlap, consistent with previous observations of strong but incomplete colocalization between transferrin and cellubrevin labeled vesicles (30.Teter K. Chandy G. Quinones B. Pereyra K. Machen T. Moore H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19625-19633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The most complete overlap was seen in the pericentriolar recycling endosomal compartment, strongly labeled by fluorescent transferrin, which was also the site of the majority of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP labeled intracellular organelles. In further support of the overlap between cellubrevin and the recycling endosomal compartment, the treatment of cells with nocodazole, which causes depolymerization of microtubules and dispersion of the recycling endosome, resulted in redistribution of both transferrin and cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP fluorescence with a preservation of the significant overlap between the two markers (Fig. 2, g–i). These observations suggest that cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP is localized in human bronchial epithelial cells with similar distribution in both CF and CFTR-corrected cells in the endosomal recycling compartment equivalent to what has been observed in several model cell lines (30.Teter K.

The colocalization of CFTR-GFP and transferrin was similar to the one observed with cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and transferrin (Fig. 2,a–f). The cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP probe did not colocalize with the early endosomal marker EEA1, although the large EEA1-positive profiles and the cellubrevin recycling endosome appeared to be closely apposed (Fig. 3, a–c). Treatment of cells with nocodazole confirmed that cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP and EEA1 were in distinct compartments (Fig. 3, d–f). The organellar distribution of EEA1 and cellubrevin compartments was similar in CFTR-corrected (Fig. 3, a–c) and CF cells (Fig. 3,insets in a–c). Cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP did not colocalize with peripheral endocytic organelles labeled with the fluid phase tracer dextran-Texas Red in fixed cells (data not shown) and in live cells monitored by time lapse microscopy (Fig. 3,g–l). Cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP was also tightly apposed to the α2,6-sialyltransferase, as revealed by immunofluorescence (Fig. 4), but remained localized distinctly from the TGN marker. There were no differences in localization of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP in the CFTR mutant cells and CFTR-corrected cells (Fig. 4, a–d, CFTR-corrected cells; insetsin b–d, CF cells). Collectively, these observations indicate that cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP probe was in the identical compartments in CFTR-corrected and CF cells and that the pH probe was in the recycling endosome.Figure 4Close apposition of cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP recycling endosomes and TGN in human bronchial epithelial cells.TGN was revealed by Myc-tagged α2,6-sialyltransferase Sttyr.

Fig. 1, e–h, illustrates the difference in fluorescence between cellubrevin-pHluorin GFP-transfected IB3-1 and C38 cells upon illumination at 410versus 470 nm. The apparent pH of cellubrevin-containing endosomes was 6.7 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E., n = 15) for the CFTR-corrected C38 and 6.7 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 32) for S9 cells compared with the apparent pH of IB3-1 CFTR mutant cells, which was 6.2 ± 0.1 (mean ± S.E.,n = 19) (Table I). Thus, cellubrevin-labeled compartments in CF mutant cells show hyperacidification of 0.5 pH unit (p = 0.0001). The pH of the cellubrevin-labeled compartments remained unaltered regardless of whether the cells were subconfluent or confluent, retaining the difference in pH between CF and CFTR-corrected cells (n= 66).Table IHyperacidification of TGN38 and cellubrevin-labeled compartments in CF respiratory epithelial cellsCell line1-aIB3–1 is a human bronchial cell line derived from a CF patient with a ΔF508/W1282XCFTR mutant genotype (21).

https://openalex.org/W1968889576,"Visual arrestin inactivates the phototransduction cascade by specifically binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. This study describes the combined use of insertional mutagenesis and immunochemical approaches to probe the structural determinants of arrestin function. Recombinant arrestins with insertions of a 10-amino acid c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) were expressed in yeast and characterized. When the tag was placed on the C terminus after amino acid 399, between amino acids 99 and 100 or between residues 162 and 163, binding to rhodopsin was found to be very similar to that of wild-type arrestin. Two stable mutants with Myc insertions in the 68–78 loop were also generated. Binding to rhodopsin was markedly decreased for one (72myc73) and completely abolished for the other (77myc78). Limited proteolysis assays using trypsin in the absence or presence of heparin were performed on all mutants and confirmed their overall conformational integrity. Rhodopsin binding to either 162myc163 or 72myc73 arrestins in solution was completely inhibited in the presence of less than a 2-fold molar excess of anti-Myc antibody relative to arrestin. In contrast, the antibody did not block the interaction of the 399myc or 99myc100 arrestins with rhodopsin. These results indicate that an interactive surface for rhodopsin is located on or near the concave region of the N-domain of arrestin. Visual arrestin inactivates the phototransduction cascade by specifically binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. This study describes the combined use of insertional mutagenesis and immunochemical approaches to probe the structural determinants of arrestin function. Recombinant arrestins with insertions of a 10-amino acid c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) were expressed in yeast and characterized.

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein-coupled receptorROSrod cell outer segmentsR*photoactivated unphosphorylated rhodopsinR*Pphotoactivated phosphorylated rhodopsin7PPthe synthetic peptide corresponding to bovine rhodopsin residues 330–348 with all seven serine and threonine residues phosphorylatedTPCKl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone are integral membrane proteins that become activated in response to a wide variety of extracellular signals such as light, neurotransmitters, hormones, and drugs (1.Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Activation of GPCRs involves a change in the receptor conformation that triggers an intracellular signaling cascade. The receptors transmit the signal by coupling to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) in the cytoplasm, which in turn modulate the activity of enzymes or ion channels leading to a cellular response (2.Wess J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 80: 231-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). G-protein-coupled receptor rod cell outer segments photoactivated unphosphorylated rhodopsin photoactivated phosphorylated rhodopsin the synthetic peptide corresponding to bovine rhodopsin residues 330–348 with all seven serine and threonine residues phosphorylated l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone Although each amplification point of the signaling cascade has its own mechanism that allows the system to return to the original inactive state, a regulatory process at the receptor level is crucial to ensure that GPCR signaling is effectively quenched (3.Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Many GPCRs are inactivated through a two-step process beginning with phosphorylation by a member from a distinct class of serine-threonine kinases known as GPCR kinases (GRKs) that interact specifically with activated receptors (4.Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is an important chemical modification that allows the activated receptors to be further recognized by proteins from the arrestin family (5.Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Arrestins stop the signal transduction quickly by directly preventing the G-protein access to the cytoplasmic loops of activated receptors (6.Krupnick J.G. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18125-18131Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This leads to a diminished cellular responsiveness to a specific stimulus, a phenomenon known as homologous desensitization. Phototransduction in retinal rod cells has been a useful model system for the study of arrestin-mediated desensitization of GPCRs (7.Hargrave P.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sakmar T. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. 1998; 59: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Both visual arrestin and rhodopsin, the GPCR that initiates phototransduction, can be isolated in comparatively large quantities from bovine retinas. Crystal structures at 2.8 Å resolution are available for both proteins (9.Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G.

Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5037) Google Scholar). Quenching of the phototransduction cascade starts when light-activated rhodopsin becomes phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues within its C terminus (12.McDowell J.H. Nawrocki J.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4968-4974Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 13.Hurley J.B. Spencer M. Niemi G.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5215-5224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Next, visual arrestin binds with high affinity and specificity to light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin by a mechanism that is incompletely understood (15.Kühn H. Hall S.W. Wilden U. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16.Baylor D.A. Burns M.E. Eye. 1998; 12: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence suggests that in addition to phosphate binding residues, arrestin contains elements that enable it to specifically recognize the loops of the photoactivated rhodopsin (17.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Raman D. Osawa S. Weiss E.R.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3226-3232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that arrestin is able to recognize the activated, unphosphorylated rhodopsin or a C-terminal truncated form of the activated rhodopsin in the presence of a synthetic fully phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the last 19 amino acids of the C terminus of rhodopsin (20.Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Additionally, charge reversal or neutralization by mutagenesis of Arg-175 in arrestin produces mutants that are able to bind to light-activated rhodopsin in its unphosphorylated state, as does a splice variant of arrestin that is truncated at its C terminus (21.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22.Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 15407-15410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known what molecular constraints prevent wild-type arrestin from binding directly to light-activated unphosphorylated rhodopsin. The crystal structure of visual arrestin has revealed that the molecule is composed of two domains, the N-domain (primarily residues 8–180) and the C-domain (primarily residues 188–362), followed by a carboxyl-terminal region (residues 372–404) that is also called the “C-tail” (9.Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10.Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure is lacking information about the location of the last 10 amino acids of the C-tail. Some features of the arrestin-rhodopsin interaction have been proposed based on studies from site-directed mutagenesis, limited proteolysis, synthetic peptides, phage display, and chemical modification of arrestin (24.Vishnivetskiy S.K.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that prior to rhodopsin binding, arrestin is maintained in an inactive conformation by multiple intramolecular electrostatic interactions among highly conserved residues from both domains and the C-tail. The interaction of rhodopsin phosphates with specific lysines and arginines in arrestin is thought to disrupt these intramolecular forces and to cause a conformational change in the molecule that leads to the exposure of currently unknown high affinity binding elements on arrestin. A highly cationic region beginning with Lys-163 located on the concave surface of the N-terminal domain of arrestin has been proposed to interact with rhodopsin phosphates by Palczewski et al. (31.Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who used the polyanion heparin to inhibit binding to the receptor. Also, polyclonal antibodies directed against peptide 170–182 were unable to bind arrestin complexed with light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin (32.Kieselbach T. Irrgang K.D. Ruppel H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Specific residues that may play a role in phosphate binding were identified by mutagenesis experiments. Among them, Arg-175 represents a key element (21.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The interaction of rhodopsin phosphates with this residue is thought to be essential for inducing a high affinity binding conformation in arrestin (33.GrayKeller M.P. Detwiler P.B. Benovic J.L. Gurevich V.V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7058-7063Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 34.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, this residue does not appear to be directly accessible in the inactive arrestin. It has been suggested that prior to contacting Arg-175 rhodopsin phosphates first interact with other specific positive charged residues from the concave surface of the N-domain (35.Vishnivetskiy S.A. Schubert C. Climaco G.C. Gurevich Y.V. Velez M.G. Gurevich V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41049-41057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The present study describes the combined use of insertional mutagenesis and immunochemical approaches to further probe the structural determinants of arrestin function. Recombinant arrestins with insertions of the c-Myc epitope at various positions were generated based on the available crystal structures of arrestin, and each mutant was tested for its ability to specifically recognize light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. Competition experiments with the anti-Myc antibody were performed in solution to test which regions of arrestin, if blocked, would affect its function. The results show that this technique represents a useful approach for the study of rhodopsin binding to visual arrestin. The hybridoma cell line expressing the anti-Myc antibody 1–9E10 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The antibody was purified on a protein A-protein G column (Pierce). Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs and Promega. T4 DNA ligase was from Invitrogen. Cloned Pfu polymerase was from Strategene. The TPCK-treated trypsin was from Sigma. Bovine arrestin and bovine rod cell outer segment (ROS) membranes were prepared as described previously (20.Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Bovine retinal arrestin was cloned into the EcoRI restriction site of the Pichia pastoris shuttle vector pPIC-ZA (Invitrogen). The synthetic oligonucleotides used for each construct are listed in Table I. The 99myc100 construct was prepared by cloning a double-stranded synthetic DNA encoding the Myc epitope sequence into the unique NarI site of the target DNA. The 399myc arrestin was made using PCR with a wild-type 5′-end primer and a mutagenic 3′-end primer containing the Myc epitope sequence. The 162myc163 and 72myc73 constructs were created by synthesizing two overlapping primers for each mutant, both containing the Myc epitope. Two separate PCR reactions were performed for each construct using one of the overlapping primers and the corresponding wild-type 5′- or 3′-end primers to generate two halves of the molecule. These were used in a third PCR to anneal the two halves together. The 77myc78 arrestin was made by “megaprimer” PCR, which consists of two PCR steps (36.Smith A.M. Klugman K.P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 438-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The first PCR was performed using an internal mutagenic primer containing the Myc epitope sequence and a wild-type 5′-end primer. The second PCR used the wild-type 3′-end primer and the purified product of the first PCR as the 5′-end primer. All recombinant DNA sequences were confirmed using Sequenase v2.0 (USB) by the dideoxy chain termination method (37.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52667) Google Scholar). The DNA constructs were linearized by digestion with the PmeI enzyme, electroporated into yeast, expressed, and purified as previously described (38.McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P.

Half of the samples were exposed to white light for 2 min at room temperature, and then all of the samples were centrifuged in the dark (40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). The pellets were solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions according to the method of Laemmli (39.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and quantified by scanning densitometry. Each Myc-tagged or wild-type arrestin (2 μm) was preincubated with increasing amounts of purified anti-Myc antibody (up to 3.3 μm) in 10 mm Hepes and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7 for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then used in centrifugation binding assays with phosphorylated rhodopsin (6 μm) in ROS membranes as described above. The pellets were solubilized in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed as previously described. Experiments were also performed in which the anti-Myc antibody was added to the preformed 162myc163 arrestin-rhodopsin complex. In this case, reaction mixtures were prepared containing arrestin (2 μm) and an excess of phosphorylated rhodopsin (6 μm) in ROS membranes in 10 mm Hepes and 100 mm NaCl, pH 7. Half of the samples were exposed to white light for 2 min. This was followed by the addition of the anti-Myc antibody (4 μm) to all samples and incubation. After centrifugation the pellets were analyzed as previously described. Centrifugation binding assays of 162myc163 and 99myc100 arrestins to unphosphorylated rhodopsin from ROS membranes were also performed in the presence of a synthetic fully phosphorylated peptide (7PP) consisting of the last 19 amino acids of rhodopsin C terminus (40.Arendt A. McDowell J.H. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Protein Pept. Lett. 1996; 3: 361-368Google Scholar). Each reaction mixture contained 6.7 μm arrestin and 6.5 μm rhodopsin in disc membranes. Half of the samples also contained 300 μm of the synthetic peptide 7PP. The assays were performed as described above in the dark or under illumination in the absence or presence of 3.3 μm anti-Myc antibody, and the pellets were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Wild-type and arrestin mutants were incubated with trypsin (TPCK-treated) in 50 mm Tris buffer, pH 8, containing 100 mm NaCl in the absence or presence of 0.13% heparin (w/v). The enzyme/protein ratio was 1% (w/w). Aliquots were withdrawn at various times, mixed with Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Five arrestin mutants were generated by placing the c-Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) into different loop regions of the molecule and on its C terminus (Fig. 1). The insertion sites were selected based on the three-dimensional structure of arrestin, aiming to minimize the probability of disrupting protein folding that would yield unstable mutants. The loops and protein ends are more likely to tolerate the insertions than β-strands and also allow the epitope sequence to be accessible for antibody recognition. The c-Myc tag was chosen because it is recognized with high affinity (KD = 80 nm) by the well characterized monoclonal antibody 9E10 (41.Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar, 42.Schiweck W. Buxbaum B. Schatzlein C. Neiss H.G. Skerra A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged arrestins were produced in yeast, and their binding to rhodopsin was compared with that of wild-type arrestin (Fig. 2). When the c-Myc tag was placed at the C-terminal end of arrestin following amino acid Glu-399 (399myc), replacing the last five amino acids, binding was found to be very similar to that of wild-type arrestin with respect to both the specificity for light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin and the amount of binding (Fig. 2). When the anti-Myc antibody was used as a competitor for arrestin binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin, there was no competition, although there was clear binding of the antibody to the 399myc arrestin as evidenced by the specific presence of more antibody in the assay pellet for the light reaction (Figs. 3 and 4). This result indicates that the C terminus of arrestin is not a binding region for rhodopsin in agreement with previous data on truncated arrestins (22.Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15334-15339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure of arrestin the C terminus can only be traced as far as residue 393, and thus the precise position of the Myc tag in the 399myc construct is not known.Figure 3Binding of wild-type and three fully functional Myc-tagged arrestins to phosphorylated rhodopsin in the absence and presence of the anti-Myc antibody. Samples containing wild-type or Myc-tagged arrestin mutants (2 μm) in the absence or presence of anti-Myc antibody (3.3 μm) were used in centrifugation binding assays with phosphorylated rhodopsin (6 μm) from ROS membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The pellets containing rhodopsin and bound proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lanes 2, 6, 10, and 14 represent the binding of wild-type and that of the fully functional Myc-tagged arrestins to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin (R*P) in the absence of the anti-Myc antibody. Lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16 represent binding of the above arrestins to R*P in the presence of the anti-Myc antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Competitive inhibition of binding between Myc-tagged arrestins and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin using the anti-Myc antibody. The same amount of each Myc-tagged arrestin (2 μm) was preincubated with increasing amounts of anti-Myc antibody (up to 3.3 μm) in solution. Binding assays to R*P (6 μm) in ROS membranes were subsequently performed (see “Experimental Procedures”). The monoclonal anti-Myc antibody inhibited the 162myc163 arrestin binding to R*P (solid triangles) in a concentration-dependent manner but did not block the binding of 99myc100 or 399myc arrestins to R*P (open circles and open triangles, respectively). Only a slight inhibitory effect was seen on the preformed 162myc163-rhodopsin complex (asterisk) in the presence of the antibody (4 μm). The results are expressed as the percentage of arrestin that bound to R*P in the absence of antibody. Each point represents the mean of three independent experiments ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When the Myc tag was inserted into two loops in the N-terminal domain, either between Asp-162/Lys-163 (162myc163) or Ala-99/Thr-100 (99myc100), the resulting constructs were fully functional (Fig. 2). In the 162myc163 construct, the insertion site is located in a concave region formed by four β-strands and loop 68–78 from the N-domain. In the 99myc100 construct the Myc tag insertion site is located in another region before the α-helix formed by residues 102–109 (Fig. 1). The effect of the anti-Myc antibody on the interaction of these mutants with rhodopsin was tested by preincubating the same amount of arrestin with increasing concentrations of the antibody in solution (Fig. 4). The anti-Myc antibody had a strong inhibitory effect on the binding of 162myc163 to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. Binding in this case was completely abolished in the presence of less than a 2-fold molar excess of antibody relative to mutant arrestin. In contrast the antibody did not affect the 99myc100-rhodopsin interaction (Figs. 3 and 4). More antibody was found specifically in the assay pellet for the light reaction compared with the dark one, a consequence of its specific binding to 99myc100. Binding assays were also conducted in which the antibody was added after the 162myc163 arrestin had been allowed to react with light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. The antibody was found predominantly in the supernatant and had only a slight inhibitory effect on the preformed 162myc163-rhodopsin complex (Fig. 4, asterisk). This suggests that the Myc tag in 162myc163 is not accessible to the antibody when arrestin is already bound to rhodopsin in solution. Two arrestins with Myc insertions in the loop region 68–78 were also generated, and the effects on rhodopsin binding were tested. Insertion of the Myc tag between Leu-77/Ser-78 (77myc78) produced a completely inactive arrestin protein, whereas insertion of the same tag between Ile-72/Asp-73 (72myc73) resulted in a construct with reduced binding to the receptor (41% relative to wild-type), although the specificity for the light-activated phosphorylated form was retained (Fig. 2). Rhodopsin binding to 72myc73 was completely inhibited in the presence of less than a 2-fold molar excess of antibody relative to arrestin, similar to the case of the fully functional 162myc163 mutant. The 162myc163 and 99myc100 arrestins were also tested for their ability to bind the light-activated unphosphorylated form of rhodopsin (R*) in the presence of the 19-amino-acid, fully phosphorylated peptide (7PP) corresponding to the C terminus of rhodopsin. It is thought that the 7PP interaction with arrestin promotes a conformational change in the molecule, which then allows the protein to recognize R* (38.McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Binding of 162myc163 or 99myc100 to R* was substantially enhanced in the presence of the 7PP (Fig. 5), an effect similar to that previously reported for wild-type arrestin (20.Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding of 162myc163 to R* was inhibited by the anti-Myc antibody, whereas that of 99myc100 was not affected. The antibody was present in the assay pellet for the light reaction with 99myc100 and R*, indicating that it was able to bind the arrestin-rhodopsin complex. Experiments were also performed to test if the anti-Myc antibody affects the activation of arrestin as measured by the interaction between 162myc163 and the synthetic 7PP. The arrestin-7PP interaction can be detected by monitoring the reactivity of the three sulfhydryl groups in arrestin. It has been shown that the rate of the reaction of the three sulfhydryl groups in arrestin to 5,5′-dithiobis(2,2′-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reagent is very slow and that the presence of 7PP increases the rate of the reactivity of one sulfhydryl group while inhibiting the reactivity of another (38.McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The effect of the 7PP on the sulfhydryl reactivity of 162myc163 was found to be similar to that of wild-type arrestin, both in the absence and presence of the anti-Myc antibody, indicating that binding of the anti-Myc antibody to 162myc163 does not prevent the 7PP from interacting with arrestin (data not shown). In addition to their binding properties, all Myc-tagged arrestin mutants were characterized by limited trypsinolysis assays as a tool to examine their conformational integrity. Insertions that affect protein folding usually produce unstable mutants that are either highly susceptible to proteolysis or form insoluble aggregates. If wild-type arrestin is partially denatured by heating at 70 °C, the change in protein conformation is readily evident from the altered trypsinolysis pattern (Fig. 6, lanes 11 and 12). Previous studies have shown that heparin and other negatively charged ligands such as light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin or the synthetic 7PP are able to bind arrestin and induce a conformational change in the molecule (20.Puig J. Arendt A. Tomson F.L. Abdulaeva G. Miller R. Hargrave P.A. McDowell J.H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26.Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Imami N.R. McDowell J.H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Although it has been determined that the conformational changes induced by these ligands may not be identical, an enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis of arrestin C terminus is a common effect (38.McDowell J.H. Smith W.C. Miller R.L. Popp M.P. Arendt A. Abdulaeva G. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6119-6125Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar to the case of wild-type arrestin (Fig. 6, lane 3), heparin enhanced the proteolysis of the C terminus in all mutants, producing a distinct pattern as shown for 162myc163 and 72myc73 arrestins (Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 9). The lysine residue in the inserted Myc tag renders the modified arrestin loops susceptible to trypsin proteolysis (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 8). Cleavage within the tag was confirmed for all mutants by Western blot analysis of the digested samples with specific antibodies (data not shown). In the presence of heparin the trypsinolysis of the inserted Myc tag in 72myc73 was enhanced (Fig. 6, lane 9), whereas that of 162myc163 was inhibited (Fig. 6, lane 6). A cationic region beginning with residue Lys-163 in bovine visual arrestin has previously been hypothesized to represent a heparin recognition site based on its similarity to heparin binding motifs found in other proteins (31.Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of study have focused on the identification of rhodopsin-binding sites on the arrestin molecule in order to understand the mechanism of its specific recognition of the light-activated and phosphorylated form of the receptor. Phage display and peptide competition studies have implicated both the N- and C-terminal domains of arrestin in the interaction with the receptor: residues 11–30, 51–70, 111–130 from the N-terminal domain and residues 231–260 from the C-terminal domain (29.Pulvermüller A. Schroder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37679-37685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30.Smith W.C. McDowell J.H. Dugger D.R. Miller R. Arendt A. Popp M.P. Hargrave P.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2752-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A recent study involving a visual arrestin chimera has implicated region 46–86 from the N-domain of the structurally similar β-arrestin member in the interaction with the corresponding m2 muscarinic cholinergic receptor (43.Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Many residues in the 163–176 region of visual arrestin have been indicated to participate in phosphate recognition (21.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Previous experiments using differential chemical modification of visual arrestin have shown that rhodopsin protects some lysine residues in both domains of arrestin from acetylation (27.Ohguro H. Palczewski K. Walsh K.A. Johnson R.S. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2428-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how all the proposed binding elements located on different regions of the arrestin molecule are approached by the light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin. A large conformational change has been suggested to occur when rhodopsin binds to visual arrestin, which could assemble many recognition elements to create a continuous receptor-binding surface (44.Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). However, the nature and the extent of this ligand-induced conformational change are not known. The results presented in this report have been obtained by using an insertional mutagenesis and antibody approach to analyze the arrestin-rhodopsin interaction. The advantage of the insertional relative to the site-directed mutagenesis technique is the ability to scan a large molecular surface by positioning an epitope tag between amino acids situated on different regions of the protein of interest. This technique has been used in the past to analyze protein-protein interactions. For example the technique was used in a study on rhodopsin topography and transducin-binding sites (45.Borjigin J. Nathans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14715-14722Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As mentioned in that study, a 10-amino-acid insertion such as the c-Myc tag is informative in both cases in which it either alters the binding interaction between proteins or in which it has no effect. If the insertion of the c-Myc tag in arrestin is placed within a region important for rhodopsin binding, a marked effect on the interaction is expected to be seen because of the size or charge of the tag. Those mutants in which the insertion does not abolish their function become useful tools in antibody competition experiments. In this study, two insertions of the Myc tag within the 68–78 loop have resulted in proteins for which binding to light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin was either markedly decreased (72myc73) or completely abolished (77myc78) in contrast to 99myc100 or 162myc163 arrestins. The modified 68–78 loop may sterically interfere with rhodopsin binding to the concave region of the N-terminal domain, which includes residues 51–70 previously implicated in the interaction with the receptor (29.Pulvermüller A. Schroder K. Fischer T. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37679-37685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the asymmetric unit of the crystal structure of arrestin the loop between residues 68–78 adopts two different conformations. In one conformation the loop is extended; in the other it is folded inside the concave surface of the N-domain (9.Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 10.Hirsch J.A. Schubert C. Gurevich V.V. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure it has been proposed that this loop might have a regulatory role in rhodopsin binding, with the closed conformation blocking rhodopsin access to the N-domain (9.Granzin J. Wilden U. Choe H.W. Labahn J. Krafft B. Buldt G. Nature. 1998; 391: 918-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The limited trypsinolysis assays on 72myc73 indicate that the modified 68–78 loop is affected by the heparin-induced conformational change as evidenced by the enhanced digestion of the Myc tag in this loop in the presence of heparin (see Fig. 6, lane 9). These results suggest that the modified 68–78 loop may either change its conformation or become more exposed upon heparin binding. Interestingly, the cleavage of the Myc tag in 162myc163 by trypsin is apparently protected by the addition of heparin (see Fig. 6, lane 6). One possible interpretation of this result is that this positioning of the Myc tag could be at or near a heparin-binding site. The insertional mutagenesis technique eliminates the need to generate high affinity antibodies of different specificities against arrestin. Most of the currently available anti-arrestin antibodies are able to function well in Western blotting or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays when arrestin is bound to a solid phase. However, these antibodies show either poor reactivity or fail to bind to arrestin in solution; consequently, they cannot be used as tools for inhibitory studies with rhodopsin. An antibody aimed at interfering with rhodopsin binding should have a high affinity for its epitope comparable with that of the arrestin-rhodopsin interaction for which the dissociation constant (KD) is on the order of 50 nm (44.Schleicher A. Kühn H. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1770-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Previous studies have determined that the anti-Myc antibody has a high affinity for the c-Myc peptide tag (KD = 80 nm). Consequently it can be used efficiently in competition experiments (42.Schiweck W. Buxbaum B. Schatzlein C. Neiss H.G. Skerra A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The anti-Myc antibody was able to block the binding interaction between 162myc163 and light-activated phosphorylated rhodopsin in a concentration-dependent manner, a behavior consistent with a competitive inhibition pattern (46.List K. Hoyer-Hansen G. Ronne E. Dano K. Behrendt N. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 222: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Further, the anti-Myc antibody was unable to disrupt the preformed 162myc163-R*P complex indicating that binding of light-activated, phosphorylated rhodopsin and that of the anti-Myc antibody to 162myc163 are mutually exclusive. The anti-Myc antibody also had an inhibitory effect on the 72myc73-rhodopsin interaction. These results suggest that the antibody binding to 162myc163 and 72myc73 occurs close to a region important for receptor recognition. Based on the crystal structure of arrestin, a possible common region blocked by the anti-Myc antibody in both constructs lies on or near the concave surface of the N-terminal domain of the molecule (see Fig. 1). In contrast, when the Myc tag was placed on a different region of the N-terminal domain of arrestin between amino acids 99 and 100 the antibody did not interfere with the arrestin-rhodopsin interaction. Previous studies have indicated that arrestin contains elements for recognition of the photoactivated rhodopsin that are distinct from the phosphate-binding elements (17.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11628-11638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Ohguro H. Annan R.S. Carr S.A. Crabb J.W. Kaplan M.W. Johnson R.S. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 314-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 47.Pulvermuller A. Maretzki D. RudnickaNawrot M. Smith W.C. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9253-9260Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As mentioned before, the concave surface of the N-domain contains a cationic region that has been implicated in the recognition of the phosphorylated state of rhodopsin (21.Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6010-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 31.Palczewski K. Pulvermuller A. Buczylko J. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in the case of the 162myc163-R*P interaction, the anti-Myc antibody may exert its inhibitory effect by shielding this cationic region. However, the anti-Myc antibody does not interfere with the interaction between the 162myc163 and the 7PP as indicated by the sulfhydryl reactivity experiments. Consequently, in the case of the 162myc163-R* interaction in the presence of 7PP, the antibody must exert its inhibitory effect by directly blocking access to those arrestin elements responsible for recognition of the photoactivated but not phosphorylated rhodopsin. Because all vertebrate arrestins share a high degree of sequence similarity, the study of visual arrestin-rhodopsin interaction is also relevant for understanding the mechanism of desensitization in other GPCRs. Indeed, the recently published crystal structure of β-arrestin at 1.9 Å resolution has revealed that its three-dimensional structure is very similar to that of visual arrestin (43.Han M. Gurevich V.V. Vishnivetskiy S.A. Sigler P.B. Schubert C. Structure. 2001; 9: 869-880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The research presented in this report shows for the first time that an antibody against a stable fully functional arrestin mutant can efficiently inhibit the visual arrestin-rhodopsin interaction in solution. The antibody competition results combined with the insertional mutagenesis data represent direct evidence for the location of a rhodopsin-binding region on or near the concave surface of the N-terminal domain of visual arrestin. This technique can also be used to probe other potential receptor interactive regions in visual and nonvisual arrestins. We thank Dr. R. J. Cohen for greatly appreciated comments and C. Shelamer for excellent technical support."

Here we studied the proteolytic activation of the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of MTX. Chymotrypsin treatment of the 97-kDa MTX holotoxin (MTX30–870) results in a 70-kDa putative binding component (MTX265–870) and a 27-kDa enzyme component (MTX30–264), possessing ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Chymotryptic cleavage of an N-terminal 32-kDa fragment of MTX (MTX30–308) also yields MTX30–264, but the resulting ADP-ribosyltransferase activity is much greater than that of the processed MTX30–870. Kinetic studies revealed a Km NAD value of 45 μm for the processed 32-kDa MTX fragment, and a Km NAD value of 1300 μm for the processed holotoxin. Moreover, the kcat value for the activated MTX30–308 fragment was about 10-fold higher than that for the activated holotoxin (MTX30–870). Precipitation analysis showed that the 70-kDa proteolytic fragment of MTX remains noncovalently bound to the N-terminal 27-kDa fragment, thereby inhibiting ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD glycohydrolase activities. Glu197 of MTX30–264 was identified as the “catalytic” glutamate that is conserved in all ADP-ribosyltransferases.

ADP-ribosylation of eukaryotic target proteins is a major biochemical mechanism that is exploited by bacterial toxins to affect the eukaryotic host cells (1.Domenighini M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 59-74Google Scholar). Among these toxins are diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas exotoxin A, which ADP-ribosylate the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 at diphthamide, a modified histidine residue, to block protein synthesis (2.Middlebrook J.L. Dorland R.B. Microbiol. Rev. 1984; 48: 199-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cholera toxin and pertussis toxin are known to ADP-ribosylate G-proteins at specific arginine and cysteine residues, respectively, to modify signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptors (3.Van den Akker F.

Members of the subfamily of binary ADP-ribosylating toxins such as Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin and Clostridium perfringens iota toxin specifically modify G-actin at Arg177 (5.Aktories K. Wegner A. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, several bacterial exoenzymes ADP-ribosylate small GTP-binding proteins of targets cells. Examples are C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases, which ADP-ribosylate Rho GTPases at Asn41(6.Rubin E.J. Gill D.M. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. Mol. Cell.

Misra R.P. Schmidt G. Barbieri J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7332-7337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Another member of the family of ADP-ribosylating toxins is the mosquitocidal toxin (MTX), 1The abbreviations used are: MTXmosquitocidal toxinGSTglutathione S-transferaseSBTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight 1The abbreviations used are: MTXmosquitocidal toxinGSTglutathione S-transferaseSBTIsoybean trypsin inhibitorEGFPenhanced green fluorescent proteinMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flightwhich is produced by the low-toxicity strain SSII-1 of Bacillus sphaericus. The toxin is lethal to Culex quinquefasciatus and Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae (10.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Jackson-Yap J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2776-2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature MTX (without the putative signal sequence of 29 amino acid residues) is a 97-kDa protein (MTX30–870). MTX30–870 is processed into a 27-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 70-kDa C-terminal fragment by crude mosquito larval gut extracts and trypsin (11.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage site is reportedly amino acid 264 (phenylalanine) for the mosquito larval gut extracts and amino acid 262 (lysine) for trypsin as determined by N-terminal sequencing. This 97-kDa fragment, previously designated MTX21, was renamed MTX30–870 in accordance with the nomenclature of our MTX truncations. MTX30–870 retains its lethal effects upon C. quinquefasciatus larvae regardless of whether it is unprocessed or proteolytically cleaved. N-terminal or C-terminal truncations of the toxin alone, however, lacked any toxicity toward mosquito larvae (12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J.

Hindley J. Jackson-Yap J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2776-2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent crystal structure analysis of bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins, including diphtheria toxin, E. coli heat-labile toxin, pertussis toxin, and the vegetative insecticidal proteins from Bacillus cereus, revealed a highly conserved structure of the NAD binding and catalytic domains of the toxins (13.Masignani V. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Aktories K. Just I. Bacterial Protein Toxins. Springer, Berlin2000Google Scholar). A common feature of the catalytic domain is a “catalytic” glutamic acid residue essential for transferase activity (14.Carroll S.F. Collier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3307-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15.Jung M. Just I. van Damme J. Vandekerckhove J. Aktories K. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1994; 14: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and often an additional glutamic acid residue located 2 residues upstream of the first one. This second glutamic acid residue is also essential for ADP-ribosylating activity (16.Domenighini M. Magagnoli C. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17.Domenighini M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 18.Takada T. Iida K.

Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20.Radke J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The putative catalytic domain of MTX possesses two glutamic acid residues at positions 195 and 197, as well as an arginine residue at position 97 and a serine residue and a threonine residue at positions 142 and 143, respectively, which appear to represent the consensus residues commonly found among bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases (see Fig. 1). Therefore, MTX is considered to be a member of the family of ADP-ribosylating toxins (1.Domenighini M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 59-74Google Scholar, 12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J.

However, a precise characterization of the MTX enzyme activity and its regulation by proteolytic activation is still pending. Here we report on the necessity of proteolytic activation of the enzyme, the regulation of enzyme activity by its putative binding component, and the identification of the catalytic glutamic acid residue by site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, we show for the first time a cytotoxic effect of the MTX enzyme component in mammalian cell culture. As shown by studies with catalytically inactive mutants, the ADP-ribosylation activity appears to be responsible for the observed biological effects. [Adenylate-32P]NAD (30 Ci/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Vilvoorde, Belgium). Chymotrypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor were from Roche Diagnostics. All other reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. For cloning of MTX30–308 consisting of amino acid residues 30–308, DNA was amplified from plasmid pTH21 (encoding MTX30–870) by PCR with the following primers: MTX30–308 sense, 5′-AGATCTGCTTCACCTAATTCTCCAAAAG-3′; and MTX30–308antisense, 5′-GTCGACCTTTTATTTTTGATTTGATATTCTG-3′. For cloning of MTX265–870 consisting of amino acids 265–870, DNA was also amplified from plasmid pTH21 by polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: MTX265–870 sense, 5′-GGATCCATACTAGATTTAGATTATAATCAAG-3′; and MTX265–870antisense, 5′-GTCGACTCTAGGTTCTACACCTAATG-3′. After cloning into the pCR™II vector (Invitrogen), the MTX fragments were cut with BglII (MTX30–308) or BamHI (MTX265–870), respectively, and SalI, purified, and ligated into the digested pGEX4-TGL vector. This vector was previously designed in our laboratory and is a modification of the pGEX-4T vector from Amersham Biosciences, Inc. The vector contains an additional oligonucleotide in the multiple cloning site that codes for a glycine linker between the GST residue and the inserted gene, enabling a better removal of the GST protein by thrombin cleavage. The proper constructs were checked by DNA sequencing (ABI PRISM; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutagenesis of MTX30–308 was performed by round circle PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange™; Stratagene) using the following sense primers and corresponding antisense primers: MTX_E195Q sense, 5′-CCCTTTCCTAACCAGGATGAAATAAC-3′; and MTX_E197Q sense, 5′-CCTAACGAGGATCAAATAACTTTTC-3′. All primers were from MWG (Ebersberg, Germany), and mutations were verified by DNA sequencing. For expression and purification of the GST fusion proteins, vectors were transformed into E. coli BL21 strains. Cells were grown in LB medium and induced with 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at an OD of 0.6. After overnight incubation at 29 °C, cells were harvested, lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and purified by affinity chromatography with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Loaded beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2). Induction of MTX30–870 protein synthesis was carried out as described by Thanabalu et al. (11.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the E. coli cells were grown to stationary phase at 37 °C, harvested, resuspended in fresh medium containing 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. MTX constructs were cleaved with thrombin directly from the beads in thrombin cleavage buffer. Thrombin was removed with benzamidine-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). 100 μg of MTX construct were incubated with 0.5 μg of chymotrypsin in a total volume of 250 μl for 60 min at room temperature. Chymotrypsin was inactivated with 2 μg of aprotinin. To check whether full cleavage was achieved, the proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. MTX30–264 and bovine serum albumin (serving as internal standard) were purified by a chloroform/methanol precipitation and dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20 pmol/μl each. A saturated matrix solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cyanocinnamic acid in a 1:1 solution of acetonitrile/aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was prepared. The MTX30–264/bovine serum albumin solution was mixed with the matrix solution in equal parts, and using the dried droplet method of matrix crystallization, 1 μl of the sample/matrix mixture was placed on the mass spectrometer target and dried at room temperature, resulting in a fine granular matrix layer. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Biflex mass spectrometer equipped with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) to desorb and ionize the samples. Mass spectra were recorded in the linear positive mode. ADP-ribosylation was performed as follows: 10 μm soybean trypsin inhibitor or 12 μg of total HeLa cell lysate proteins were incubated with 100 μm [32P]NAD and 100 nm MTX fragment for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmMgCl2, and 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and heating for 5 min at 95 °C, and the samples were subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE according to the methods of Laemmli (21.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). [32P]ADP-ribosylated proteins were detected with a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics. To study the inhibition of MTX ADP-ribosyltransferase activity by its putative binding component, MTX30–264 (100 nm) was preincubated with varying concentrations of MTX265–870(25–200 nm) for 5 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, ADP-ribosyltransferase assays were performed as described above. For measurement of glycohydrolase activity, the MTX fragments (1 μm each) were incubated with 100 μm [32P]NAD in 10 μl of a buffer containing 2 mm MgCl2 and 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, for 1 h. 2 μl of each reaction mixture were separated by TLC on TLC aluminum sheets (Silica Gel 60 F254; Merck) with 66% 2-propanol/0.33% ammonium sulfate and analyzed by phosphorimaging. Initial rate data for the ADP-ribosyltransferase reaction was determined with regard to NAD binding by varying the NAD concentration from 30 to 500 μm for activated MTX30–308 and from 250 to 5000 μm for activated MTX30–870. Experiments were performed at fixed SBTI concentrations of 10 μm. The amount of SBTI utilized was <10%. In all experiments, toxin concentrations were 100 nm, and incubation time was 5 min for MTX30–308 and 30 min for MTX30–870 at room temperature. Kinetic values were obtained by quantifying the PhosphorImager data with the help of the ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) and transforming the data to the Lineweaver-Burk plot. GST and GST-MTX265–870were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with HeLa cytosol (0.2 μg/μl) for 30 min at 4 °C to block nonspecific binding sites. Beads were washed twice with buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 2 mm MgCl2) and once with thrombin cleavage buffer. The beads were then incubated with MTX30–264 for 30 min at room temperature. Beads were washed as described before and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Next, the proteins were either detected with Coomassie Blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for subsequent immunoblotting. For immunoblot analysis, the membrane was blocked for 60 min with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) followed by a 1-h incubation with an anti-MTX30–264 antibody (rabbit, 1:2000 in PBS-T). After washing with PBS-T, the blot was incubated for 1 h with goat anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000 in PBS-T) and washed. Proteins were detected with the Amersham Biosciences, Inc. enhanced chemiluminescence system as instructed by the manufacturer. The eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH), encoding EGFP under the cytomegalovirus promoter, was used for easy identification of transfected cells. MTX30–308 and MTX30–264were amplified from the pTH21 vector using the following primers adding BglII and SalI sites: MTX30–308/MTX30–264 sense, 5′-AGATCTGCTTCACCTAATTCTCCAAAAG-3′; MTX30–308 antisense, 5′-GTCGACCTTCTTATTTTTGATTTGATATTCTG-3′; and MTX30–264antisense, 5′-GTCGACAAAACCTTTAGAATCCATATTATTTC-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were digested and inserted into the digested pEGP-C1 vector. The E195Q mutation and the E197Q mutation, respectively, were introduced using the QuikChange™ kit (Stratagene) and the primers described for the pGEX-MTX30–308 mutants. Plasmid DNAs were propagated in E. coli and purified for the following transfection studies. For transfection studies, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h in Dulbeccos's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (PAN Systems, Aidenbach, Germany) and 4 mm glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin in 30-mm dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. HeLa cells were then transfected with a 5:1 ratio of the respective plasmids encoding the MTX constructs and the pEGFP-C1 vector or the pEGFP-C1 vector alone using the Polyfect transfection kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's manual. For actin cytoskeleton staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% formaldehyde plus 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then incubated with 1 μg/ml tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin for 60 min in the dark at room temperature. Cells were examined by fluorescence microscopy after 24 h of incubation, and pictures were obtained with a Zeiss microscope supplied with a digital camera. To study ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the MTX and its possible regulation, we constructed the vector pGEX-MTX265–870, encoding the 70-kDa C-terminal part of the toxin (amino acids 265–870), and tried to construct the vector pGEX-MTX30–264, encoding the 27-kDa N-terminal part of the toxin (amino acids 30–264). However, no correct pGEX-MTX30–264 clone was obtained, despite several cloning strategies. Using the pET vector system (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany), we obtained correct pET-MTX30–264 clones as long as nonexpression host cells were used. These cells lack the DE3-lysogen encoding the T7-polymerase necessary for transcription from the pET vector. Due to possible cytotoxicity of the MTX30–264 fragment toward E. coli, we constructed the vector pGEX-MTX30–308, encoding a 32-kDa N-terminal part of the toxin (amino acids 30–308). Fig. 2A gives an overview of the MTX constructs used in this study. We proteolytically cleaved MTX30–308 to generate the 27-kDa fragment. Cleavage of MTX30–870 resulted in the 27- and 70-kDa fragments of MTX. Because trypsin treatment resulted in incomplete cleavage, chymotrypsin was used. The expressed MTX proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE before and after chymotrypsin treatment (Fig. 2B). Note that in contrast to the MTX30–276 fragment reported by Thanabalu et al. (12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which runs like a 70-kDa protein, the MTX30–308 truncation runs as predicted from the amino acid sequence as a 32-kDa protein. The difference in migration on SDS-PAGE of the 27-kDa fragments after cleavage of MTX30–870 and MTX30–308 is due to the use of different expression vectors for the constructs. MTX30–308 carries an additional 12 amino acids at its N terminus (remnants of the glycine linker), whereas MTX30–870 carries only 3 additional amino acids of vector origin at its N terminus. These amino acids are not removed by chymotrypsin treatment, and therefore the 27-kDa cleavage products show a mass difference of about 600 Da (Fig. 2B). However, exact protein molecular mass determination by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data confirmed that chymotryptic cleavage of MTX30–308 results in the corresponding MTX fragment as reported for cleavage of MTX30–870, with phenylalanine 264 as the cleavage site (11.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). Initial experiments showed that cleaved MTX ADP-ribosylates a large array of different proteins in lysates of insect cells (data not shown) and mammalian cultured cell lines (see also Fig. 9). To test the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the MTX constructs in more detail, SBTI was chosen as an in vitro model substrate. MTX and its fragments were incubated with SBTI and [32P]NAD for 30 min at room temperature. After SDS-PAGE, labeling was detected by a PhosphorImager. Only proteolytically cleaved MTX30–870 and proteolytically cleaved MTX30–308 led to labeling of SBTI. Interestingly, cleaved MTX30–308 catalyzed labeling to a much larger extent than processed MTX30–870 (Fig. 3A). Because several ADP-ribosyltransferases possess NAD glycohydrolase activity, i.e. hydrolysis of NAD in the absence of a protein substrate, we tested whether this was also true for MTX. Consistent with the ADP-ribosylation results, only cleaved MTX constructs were capable of hydrolyzing NAD. Again, the proteolytically cleaved MTX30–308 was much more active than cleaved MTX30–870 (Fig. 3B).Figure 3Activity of proteolytically cleaved MTX fragments. A, ADP-ribosylation of SBTI by different MTX constructs (100 nm each). SBTI (10 μm) was incubated with the indicated MTX constructs in the presence of [32P]NAD for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging (shown). B, NAD glycohydrolase activity of MTX.

Constant amounts of SBTI were used in an ADP-ribosylation assay with either activated MTX30–308 or activated MTX30–870 at varying concentrations of NAD. The Km NAD value for activated MTX30–308 was found to be 45 μm, and kcat was calculated to be 2.5 min−1, resulting in a kcat:Km ratio of 0.06 min−1m−1. For MTX30–870, a Km NAD value of 1300 μm and a kcat value of 0.5 min−1 were obtained, resulting in a kcat:Km ratio of 0.0004 min−1m−1 (Table I).Table IKinetics of ADP-ribosyltransferase activityKm(NAD)kcatkcat:Kmμmmin−1min−1Activated MTX30–30845 ±72.5 ± 10.06Activated MTX30–8701300 ± 1960.5 ± 0.30.0004Enzyme kinetics of activated MTX30–308 and activated MTX30–870. ADP-ribosylation of SBTI was performed with activated MTX30–308 and activated MTX30–870 in the presence of varying concentrations of [32P]NAD as described. Labeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The data were quantified, and kinetic values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burk plot transformation of data.

Data are given as means ± S.E. (n = 3). After chymotryptic cleavage of MTX30–870, the 27- and 70-kDa fragments could only be separated by denaturing methods. Therefore, we attempted to co-precipitate MTX30–264 (obtained by cleavage of MTX30–308) with GST-MTX265–870 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and vice versa. After incubation of the loaded beads with the toxin fragments and washing, the beads were subjected to SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 4, MTX30–264 was co-precipitated by GST-MTX265–870, whereas no MTX30–264 band was detectable with GST alone. The same binding and co-precipitation was found when MTX265–870 was incubated with GST-MTX30–264 immobilized to glutathione-Sepharose beads (data not shown). As described above, MTX265–870remained bound to MTX30–264 after proteolytic cleavage. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether this interaction had any effect on the enzyme activity, possibly explaining why cleaved MTX30–870 showed markedly less enzyme activity than cleaved MTX30–308 (Fig. 3). Therefore, MTX30–264 (obtained by cleavage of MTX30–308) was preincubated with varying concentrations of MTX265–870, and, then the ADP-ribosylation was started. As shown in Fig. 5A, in the presence of equimolar concentrations of MTX30–264 and MTX265–870, ADP-ribosylation of SBTI was drastically reduced. A 1:1 ratio of both MTX fragments exhibited an activity similar to that of the proteolytically activated MTX30–870. The inhibition of the enzyme activity by MTX265–870 was concentration-dependent, and a 1-fold surplus of MTX265–870 almost completely inhibited the enzyme activity (Fig. 5B). Moreover, MTX265–870 also inhibited NAD glycohydrolase activity of MTX30–264 (data not shown). By sequence alignments with other ADP-ribosyltransferases, amino acids 195 and 197 (both glutamic acid residues) of MTX are proposed to be important for catalysis (1.Domenighini M. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Moss J. Iglewski B. Vaughan M. Tu A.T. Bacterial Toxins and Virulence Factors in Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, Basel, Hong Kong1995: 59-74Google Scholar, 16.Domenighini M. Magagnoli C. Pizza M. Rappuoli R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). The respective MTX30–308E195Q and MTX30–308E197Q mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli and purified as described. The mutants were treated with chymotrypsin, and degradation was followed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 6A). We did not observe any differences in the sensitivity of wild-type and mutant MTX proteins toward proteolytic cleavage, suggesting no major folding changes of the mutant proteins. Mutant MTX proteins were tested for ADP-ribosylation activity, but none was active, indicating that both glutamate residues, Glu195 and Glu197, were essential for transferase activity (Fig. 6B). It is reported that only the C-terminal glutamate of the glutamate-aspartate-glutamate (EXE) motif in the catalytic domain is essential for NAD glycohydrolase activity in “biglutamic” ADP-ribosyltransferases (19.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 20.Radke J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study whether this is also true for MTX, NAD glycohydrolase assays with the MTX30–308 mutants (cleaved/uncleaved) were performed. The E197Q mutant was not capable of hydrolyzing NAD regardless of proteolytic treatment. By contrast, the E195Q mutant hydrolyzed NAD, but only after proteolytic cleavage. The NAD glycohydrolase activity was similar to that of activated MTX30–308 (Fig. 6C). Next, we tested the MTX toxin for cytotoxic effects on mammalian cells. To this end, a plasmid encoding for a fusion protein of EGFP with MTX30–264 was constructed. Transfection of HeLa cells with this plasmid resulted in morphological changes in cells expressing the protein as observed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 7). The vector encoding the EGFP-MTX30–264 protein was co-transfected with the pEGFP-C1 vector in a 5:1 ratio to enhance fluorescence because fluorescence was very weak when the pEGFP-MTX30–264 construct was transfected alone. To obtain comparable experimental conditions, this co-transfection was done routinely with all other pEGFP-MTX plasmids used in this study. Cells expressing the 27-kDa MTX catalytically active fragment exhibited formation of filopodia-like protrusions and rounding up. Staining of the actin cytoskeleton with tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin proved that the protrusions contain actin (Fig. 8). In contrast, HeLa cells expressing the EGFP-MTX30–264E197Q fusion protein did not show morphological changes as seen in Fig. 7. Cells expressing the EGFP-MTX30–264E195Q mutant protein exhibited some changes in cell morphology, however, this effect was much less pronounced than that seen in cells expressing the wild-type enzyme component (Fig. 7). Additionally, a plasmid encoding a fusion protein of EGFP with MTX30–308 was cloned to check whether this truncation is inactive in vivo, as it is in vitro, giving further proof of the necessity of enzyme activation. Cells transfected with the vector encoding MTX30–308 and cells transfected with the vector alone exhibited no significant morphological changes (Fig. 7). Fig. 9 shows that MTX30–264 (derived from MTX30–308) ADP-ribosylated several proteins in lysates of HeLa cells. By contrast, MTX30–308, which was without biological activity after transfection, did not ADP-ribosylate any protein in the cell lysates, and the same was true for the processed MTX mutant proteins.Figure 8Actin cytoskeleton staining of pEGFP-MTX-transfected HeLa cells.

The toxin is reportedly proteolytically cleaved into a 27-kDa N-terminal fragment and a 70-kDa C-terminal fragment (11.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary studies suggested that the 27-kDa fragment harbors the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of MTX. In the present study, we characterized the biochemical and biological activities of the 27-kDa fragment in more detail. Our approach for constructing an expression vector encoding the MTX30–264gene was only successful as long as the plasmid was transformed into nonexpression host cells. Transformation into host cells, which are capable of vector expression, led to either defective clones or no transformation at all. By contrast, the gene of an enzymatically defective MTX30–264 (MTX30–264E195/197Q) was easily cloned into a pGEX or pET vector and transformed into expression host cells. Therefore, we suggest that MTX30–264 is toxic to E. coli due to its enzyme activity. Notably, a putative ADP-ribosyltransferase (pierisin-1) from a cabbage butterfly that is homologous to MTX (32% identity at the amino acid level) was reported to be toxic to E. coli (22.Watanabe M. Kono T. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kanazawa T. Nishisaka N. Kishimoto T. Koyama K. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10608-10613Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Whereas the complete molecule of pierisin-1 exhibits toxicity to E. coli, MTX30–870 is nontoxic to the expressing bacteria. Therefore, MTX30–870 and a 32-kDa N-terminal MTX truncation (MTX30–308), which were well expressed in E. coli, were used to generate the 27-kDa fragment by chymotryptic cleavage and to study its enzyme activity. Study of the in vitro activity of our MTX constructs revealed potent activation by proteolytic cleavage of the toxin and ADP-ribosylation of several proteins in mammalian cell lysates. To analyze the enzyme activity in more detail, we used SBTI, which is a well-known artificial substrate for ADP-ribosylation by bacterial transferases (23.Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as a model substrate. By comparing the activities of the toxin fragments, we observed that cleaved MTX30–870was markedly less active than cleaved MTX30–308. This finding was surprising because both fragments yielded MTX30–264 as a cleavage product, which was shown in this study to harbor the catalytic activity. To clarify these discrepancies, we compared the enzyme kinetics of both fragments. For MTX30–264 derived from the 32-kDa MTX fragment (MTX30–308), the Km NAD value was 45 μm. This value fits well into the range of the Km values reported for other bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases such as diphtheria toxin (24.Blanke S.R. Huang K. Wilson B.A. Papini E. Covacci A. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5155-5161Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or exoenzyme S (25.Liu S. Kulich S.M. Barbieri J.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2754-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The Km NAD value of the proteolytically activated MTX30–870, however, was about 30-fold higher, and the kcat value was decreased by a factor of about 10. With regard to the kcat:Km value of both constructs, the activated MTX holotoxin was 150-fold less active than the activated MTX30–308 construct. We suggest that the 70-kDa C-terminal fragment that is generated by cleavage of MTX30–870 is responsible for the low activity of activated MTX30–870. Therefore, we analyzed whether MTX30–264 and MTX265–870 do interact. Precipitation assays revealed that both fragments remain tightly bound to each other after cleavage. This interaction between MTX30–264 and MTX265–870 explains the inability to separate these two fragments by methods not involving denaturing techniques. For example, chromatographic or size exclusion methods failed, consistent with the reports of Thanabalu et al. (12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two toxin fragments stick to each other after proteolytic cleavage due to strong noncovalent interactions. Disulfide bonds can be ruled out because MTX30–870 contains no cysteine residues. To study the consequences of the interaction, we determined the enzyme activity of MTX30–264 at increasing concentrations of MTX265–870. These studies revealed that the interaction of both fragments effectively blocked ADP-ribosylation as well as NAD glycohydrolase activity. With regard to the kinetic data of activated MTX30–308 and activated MTX30–870, the MTX binding component can be regarded as a noncompetitive autoinhibitor of the MTX enzyme component because both the Km value and the kcat value are changed. We further suggest that the 5-kDa C-terminal part of MTX30–308 is sufficient to shield the catalytic domain or to stabilize an inactive conformational structure of MTX30–308. During cleavage of MTX30–308, the 5-kDa fragment is further proteolytically degraded and does not inhibit MTX30–264 enzyme activity. Characterization of the catalytic domain of MTX revealed typical features of a biglutamic acid ADP-ribosyltransferase. Alignments with other bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases suggested that the EXE motif in positions 195–197 plays an important role in ADP-ribosylation. Exchange of Glu195 or of Glu197 totally blocked the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. As described for other bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases such as P. aeruginosa exoenzyme S (20.Radke J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or C. botulinum C2 toxin (19.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), both glutamic acid residues in the catalytic domain are important for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, but only the second glutamate in the EXE motif is necessary for NAD glycohydrolase activity. Whereas proteolytically cleaved MTX30–308E195Q possessed glycohydrolase activity, cleaved MTX30–308E197Q did not. These findings are in line with the notion that Glu197 of MTX is the catalytic glutamate residue, which is highly conserved among the family of ADP-ribosyltransferases, and that Glu195 is the second important glutamic residue in the catalytic domain, consistent with other biglutamic ADP-ribosyltransferases (19.Barth H. Preiss J.C. Hofmann F. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29506-29511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,20.Radke J. Pederson K.J. Barbieri J.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1508-1510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The construction of enzymatically inactive MTX mutants was helpful in studying the role of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in the biological action of MTX. Thus far, only a lethal effect of the MTX holotoxin on certain mosquito larvae and a cytotoxic effect on insect cell cultures had previously been reported (10.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Jackson-Yap J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2776-2785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Thanabalu T. Hindley J. Berry C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5051-5056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Thanabalu T. Berry C. Hindley J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2314-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the cytotoxic effects (aggregation of cultured insect cells) reported were observed even with a C-terminal fragment of MTX lacking the enzyme domain. Here we report for the first time a cytotoxic effect related to the enzyme activity of MTX. Neither the MTX holotoxin nor the activated MTX30–308enzyme fragment alone showed any toxic effect when applied directly onto mammalian cell cultures. However, transfection of HeLa cells with a vector encoding the active 27-kDa enzyme component of MTX led to cytotoxic effects characterized by rounding up of cells and increased formation of filopodia-like structures. This in vivo effect of MTX on mammalian cells was not observed with the catalytically inactive MTX30–264E197Q mutant. MTX30–264E195Q, which possesses NAD glycohydrolase activity but not transferase activity, caused minor changes in HeLa cells. Whether this effect is caused by NAD glycohydrolase activity remains to be studied; however, this effect was much less pronounced than that induced by the wild-type toxin fragment. The results indicate that the MTX enzyme activity is responsible for the cytotoxicity observed, whereas the transferase activity seems to be decisive. Transfection of the vector encoding the N-terminal 32-kDa truncation of MTX (MTX30–308) was not toxic for HeLa cells. These findings support in vitro results, showing that proteolytic cleavage is necessary to activate the toxin. Thus far, the in vivo substrate of MTX and the molecular mechanism of cytotoxicity are unknown. The observed cell rounding and the formation of the actin-containing protrusions might be a hint that one or more proteins important in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton are affected. This would be in line with numerous other bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins that act on the actin cytoskeleton, such as C. botulinum C2 toxin that modifies actin (26.Aktories K. Bärmann M. Ohishi I. Tsuyama S. Jakobs K.H. Habermann E. Nature. 1986; 322: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) or C. botulinum C3 exoenzyme with Rho as a substrate (8.Sekine A. Fujiwara M. Narumiya S. J.

In vitro, MTX30–264 ADP-ribosylates numerous proteins in HeLa cell lysate as well as in other eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell lysates (data not shown). This phenomenon is also known for other ADP-ribosyltransferases, e.g. exoenzyme S, which appears to target Ras as a preferred substrate (23.Coburn J. Wyatt R.T. Iglewski B.H. Gill D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9004-9008Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional studies are under way to characterize the in vivo substrates of MTX in mammalian and insect cells.

PI3-kinase has been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including mitogenesis, growth factor receptor regulation, actin-cytoskeleton rearrangement, and intracellular trafficking of proteins (4.Alessi D.R.

Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 16.Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar). For agonist-induced desensitization, activation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) and protein kinase A play critical roles in catalyzing phosphorylation of the β2AR required for eventual internalization (15.Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). As counterregulation of β2AR by insulin involves changes in phosphorylation and the trafficking of the receptor, we were intrigued by the possibility that Akt may be mediating these effects of insulin on this well known member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the current work, we investigate the nature of the signaling downstream of insulin activation of PI3-kinase, focusing upon the role of Akt. We show that activation of PI3-kinase and Akt is essential for insulin counterregulation and sequestration of β2AR. Human epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), plus penicillin (60 μg/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C (17.Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). For epifluoresence imaging, the larger A431 cells proved to be superior for localization studies to the CHO cells, and so this analysis was confined to the A431 cells. Cells were transfected with expression vectors harboring the GFP-tagged β2AR using LipofectAMINE® (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and viable clones were selected in 400 μg/ml of the neomycin analog G418. Resistant colonies were subcloned and screened for GFP fusion protein expression by epifluorescence microscopy. Expression of β2AR was monitored by radioligand binding, using iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) as the labeled probe (18.Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8692-8699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates and crude membranes were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels, transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose blots, and the blots stained with specific antibodies, as reported earlier. The antibodies employed in these studies and their suppliers were as follows: antiphosphotyrosine-pY69 (anti-pY) mouse monoclonal (Transduction Laboratories); antiphosphoserine (anti-pS) rabbit polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); antiphosphothreonine (anti-pT) rabbit polyclonal (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); anti-β2AR-CM04 (Malbon Laboratory); anti-Akt1,2,3 rabbit polyclonal (Cell Signaling Technology); anti-HA tag-high affinity anti-HA clone 3F10 mouse monoclonal (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Microscopy of live cells was performed on the Eclipse TE300 (Nikon) inverted microscope equipped with ×40 oil objective. Images were acquired using MicroMAX Imaging System (Princeton Instruments Inc.) and WinView32 software (19.Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones were routinely challenged in cell medium following serum deprivation for 8–12 h without or with 100 nm insulin for 15 min and the trafficking of the GFP-tagged β2AR monitored by epifluorescence microscopy. Cells were serum-deprived for 8 h prior to removing growth factors and catecholamines from the cell medium. PI3-kinase was inhibited using the LY294002 compound (10 μm). For studies of the effects of inhibitor on the trafficking of the GFP-tagged receptor in response to insulin, the inhibitor was added 30 min in advance of the challenge with insulin. The fusion protein of GST with the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of the β2AR (BAC1-C1 protein) was phosphorylated at 37 °C in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 0.05 Tris-HCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmγ-[32P]ATP (0.5–2.0 × 1015 cpm/mol), 0.02 unit/μl Akt (Upstate Biotechnology) and BAC1 (1.0 μm). One unit of Akt activity corresponds to 1 pmol of phosphate transfer per min at pH 7.4 at 30 °C. Phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of the enzyme to the reaction mixture. After a 30-min incubation, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.1% SDS and 50 mm dithiothreitol for 5 min at 75 °C and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved protein gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, stained, and the radiolabeled proteins made visible by autoradiography. For assay of cyclic AMP accumulation, stably transfected A431 cells were seeded in 24-well plates 48 h prior to determination, at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. On the day of experiment, cell culture medium was aspirated, the cells washed and replenished with Krebs-Ringer phosphate medium containing 10 μm RO-201724 (cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor), and then treated with the isoproterenol (10 μm) for 5 min in a total assay volume of 300 μl. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 100% ethanol, and the cyclic AMP content measured by the competitive binding assay, as described (11.Karoor V. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29347-29352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To assay insulin counterregulation, cells were pretreated with or without LY294002 for 30 min and then challenged with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. Confluent cultures of A431 cells were serum-starved for 12 h and then treated without and with 100 nm insulin for 15 min. In each case, cultures were pooled from five 100 mm Petri dishes. The cells were lysed and the β2AR subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody CM04, using 25 μg of antibody per 0.1 ml of A/G agarose. Immunoprecipitates were digested with 1 μg of trypsin for 8 h at room temperature. The phosphate-containing peptides were isolated on Fe3+ columns (0.1 ml volume) and then analyzed on an ABI Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the matrix. We measured the ability of insulin to counterregulate β-adrenergic-stimulated cyclic AMP in CHO clones expressing ∼30,000 β-adrenergic receptors per cell (Fig. 1). Isoproterenol (10 μm) stimulated rapid accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP (Fig. 1 A). Treatment with insulin (100 nm) 15 min in advance of challenge with the β-adrenergic agonist inhibits the cyclic AMP response of the cells to stimulation by the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol, reducing the response by 50% (Fig. 1 B). PI3-kinase has been shown to be an obligate, early downstream element in insulin signaling (3.Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We probed the possible role of PI3-kinase in insulin counterregulation of catecholamine-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation using the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Treatment with LY294002 (10 μm) alone had little effect on β-adrenergic stimulation of intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 1 C); whereas it abolished the counterregulatory effect of insulin on cyclic AMP accumulation in response to isoproterenol (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that the counterregulatory effects of insulin on catecholamine action share PI3-kinase activation upstream. The time course for insulin-stimulated counterregulation of β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation was found to be half-maximal within 5 min (Fig. 1 E). Based upon the summation of the experiments, insulin is shown to counterregulate β-adrenergic-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and in a manner that is sensitive to blockade by the LY294002 inhibitor of PI3-kinase (Fig. 1 F). Using a GFP-tagged version of the human β2AR, we examined the influence of insulin on receptor sequestration in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells in which endogenous β2AR expression is ∼35,000 receptors per cell, <10% of which are GFP-tagged (Fig. 2). A431 cells have been employed for analysis of β2AR sequestration, providing an optimal cell type for epifluorescence microscopy (17.Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Malbon C.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 519-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 20.Kashles O. Levitzki A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The time course for insulin-stimulated sequestration of β2AR was rapid, demonstrable intracellular accumulation (yellow arrowheads) and cell membrane thinning (white arrows) of β2AR observed within minutes of stimulation by insulin (Fig. 2 A). Insulin-stimulated counterregulation of β2AR was examined in the absence and the presence of the LY294002 inhibitor (Fig. 2 B). The A431 cells display the same counterregulatory effects of insulin on β2AR signaling as was observed in the CHO clones. Epifluorescence studies of GFP-tagged β2AR in A431 cells revealed that in the presence of insulin, β2ARs underwent a prominent sequestration, internalizing from the cell membrane (white arrows) into perinuclear regions of the cells (Fig. 2 C, yellow arrowheads). The magnitude of the insulin-stimulated sequestration reaches >60% of the cellular complement of β2AR and is of greater magnitude than that stimulated by β-adrenergic agonist-induced sequestration (14.Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Treating the cells with LY294002, which abolishes the ability of insulin to inhibit catecholamine-stimulated cyclic AMP response, also abolished the ability of insulin to provoke the internalization of β2AR (Figs. 1and 2). Treatment with the LY294002 compound alone produced no significant effect on the cyclic AMP response (Figs. 1 F and2 B) or on the localization of β2AR (Fig. 2 C). Because activation of PI3-kinase results in the activation of downstream serine-threonine protein kinases, like Akt, we exmined the phosphorylation state of the β2AR (Fig. 3). An HA-tagged version of the human β2AR was expressed in CHO cells, and the cells were treated with insulin (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with insulin (100 nm) resulted in increased phosphorylation of the β2AR, as detected with phosphoserine-, phosphothreonine-, and phosphotyrosine-specific antibodies. The β2AR has been shown bothin vitro and in vivo to be a substrate for tyrosine phosphorylation catalyzed by the insulin receptor itself (9.Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), confirmed herein (Fig. 3 A) (10.Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29347-29352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Increases in phosphoserine and phosphothreonine content of the β2AR in response to insulin had been noted earlier (9.Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), but the protein kinase(s) responsible for this phosphorylation remained elusive. To test further the nature of the serine phosphorylation of the β2AR, we investigated the effects of expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Akt (T308D/S473D; CA-Akt) on the phosphorylation state of the β2AR. Co-expression of CA-Akt resulted in increased phosphorylation of β2AR that mimicked that observed in cells stimulated by insulin (Fig. 3 A). Thus, stimulation of cells with insulin or expression of CA-Akt leads to increased phosphoserine content of the β2AR.Figure 3Phosphorylation of β2AR by insulin in vivo occurs at Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues: identification of sites of phosphorylation by Akt. Panel A, CHO-K cells were transiently transfected with HA-tagged β2AR adrenergic receptor and/or co-transfected with constitutively active mutant (CA-Akt) of Akt. After serum starvation for 12 h, cells were treated with 0.1 μm insulin for 15 min. HA·β2AR was isolated from cell lysate by immunoprecipitation with HA-specific antibodies, subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose blots, and stained with antibodies specific for phosphoserine (pS), phosphothreonine (pT), phosphotyrosine (pY) or β2AR (CM-2). The results displayed are sample images, representative of more than four separate experiments.Panel B, in vitro phosphorylation of a GST fusion protein with the C-terminal, cytoplasmic domain of β2AR (C1). GST fusion proteins with progressively truncated C-terminal cytoplasmic domains of β2AR (C4–C6) or the GST itself were incubated with recombinant, activated Akt. The labeled products were separated in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. Protein constructs included the full-length C-terminal domain of β2AR (C1, Arg328–Leu413 fragment), Arg328–Tyr366 fragment (C4), Arg328–Asn352 fragment (C5), Arg328–Cys341 fragment (C6) and GST itself. Arrows show positions of C-terminal domain phosphorylation by Akt, as deduced by the studies. The results displayed are sample images, representative of more than four separate experiments. Panels C and D, mass spectrometry of tryptic digests of β2AR obtained from A431 cells that were untreated or treated with 100 nm insulin for 15 min.

We hypothesized that Akt might be playing a role similar to GRK and/or protein kinase A on this domain downstream of insulin activation of PI3-kinase. Akt is a serine-threonine-specific protein kinase activated in response to the activation of PI3-kinase, so we examined the β2AR sequence for a motif found in other Akt substrates (21.Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

We tested this hypothesis in vitro by preparing a series of GST-tagged proteins corresponding to the C-terminal domain of the β2AR progressively truncated from the C terminus (23.Fan G. Shumay E.

The full-length, C-terminal domain of the β2AR (C1) has been shown to be readily phosphorylated by protein kinase A, GRK2, and the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (24.Doronin S. Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 20: 451-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We used this in vitroapproach with purified, activated Akt to establish the sites of β2AR phosphorylation and test if the canonical motif for Akt was, in fact, a substrate (Fig. 3 B). The peptide corresponding to the full-length, C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (GST·Arg328–Leu413) of the β2AR was a substrate for Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation. Deletion mutants of the C-terminal domain of the β2AR were prepared (C4, C5, and C6) and employed in the phosphorylation reaction. Peptides C4 (Arg328–Tyr366) and C5 (Arg328–Asn352), like the C1 protein itself, were phosphorylated by Akt. Deletion of Leu342–Leu413 (C6) of the β2AR C-terminal domain, in contrast, resulted in the loss of phosphorylation by Akt. These results provide evidence that the RRSSLKAY motif in the C-terminal domain of the β2AR is phosphorylated by Akt. The phosphoamino acid analysis performed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A), likewise confirms the results that Akt phosphorylates serine residues of the β2AR. Having established the ability of the β2AR to act as a substrate for phosphorylation by Akt in vitro, we used this information to ascertain the phosphorylation of this site of the β2AR in vivo. To determine whether the canonical site for Akt phosphorylation indeed was phosphorylated in response to insulin, we stimulated A431 cells with insulin, isolated the β2AR, and determined the phosphorylation state of the receptor peptide fragment that harbors the canonical site. β2AR from A431 cells treated with and without insulin (100 nm, 30 min) were isolated, digested with trypsin, and subject to MALDI mass spectrometry (Fig. 3 C). The analysis identified the phosphorylated peptide SSLK (495.6m/z, denoted by asterisk). The amount of the phosphorylated peptide was increased in tryptic digests from β2AR isolated from the insulin-treated as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3 C). We employed mass spectrometry to test if the mass change was due to phosphorylation by comparing the spectrum of the mass analysis performed in the linear compared with the reflector mode. Serine-phosphorylated peptides are easily lost to in-source (25.Lennon J.J. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2487-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and post-source (26.Annan R.S. Carr S.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) decay. This behavior is diagnostic for serine-phosphorylated peptides and can be detected by their differential loss in the reflectron mode as compared with the linear mode of detection of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (25.Lennon J.J. Walsh K.A. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2487-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26.Annan R.S. Carr S.A. J. Protein Chem. 1997; 16: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 27.Mann M.

Subject the same sample to either mode revealed the loss of the 495.6m/z species in the reflectron mode (peptide 1), indicating the lability of the phosphate group. The dehydroalanine derivative, displaying 401.3 m/z (Fig. 3 D, peptide 2), is the product of the decay of the phosphorylated precursor peptide phospho-SSLK and was detected in both the linear and reflectron mode of MALDI mass spectrometry. Thus by phosphorylation studies in vitro as well as by phosphoserine analysis and by mass spectrometry in vivo we demonstrate the phosphorylation of a canonical Akt site in the β2AR in response to insulin stimulation. It was important to ascertain if the Ser345, Ser346 residues of the β2AR were critical to the ability of insulin to counterregulate the cyclic AMP response of the cells to isoproterenol stimulation. We prepared the S345A/S346A (AA) double substitutions in the β2AR and examined the ability of insulin to inhibit the cyclic AMP response and induce β2AR sequestration (Fig. 4). The S345A/S346A double mutant β2AR no longer demonstrates sensitivity to insulin with respect to isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 4 A). The AA mutant β2AR displayed normal activation in response to isoproterenol (data not shown). Similarly, the AA mutant β2AR was not sequestered in response to insulin (Fig. 4 B). The sequestration observed in response to insulin stimulation for β2AR (Figs. 2 A and 4 B) was tested for another member of the superfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors, the 5HT2a serotonin receptor. The 5HT2a receptor was not sequestered either by 100 nm insulin (+Ins) stimulation or stimulation with the β2AR agonist, isoproterenol (Fig. 4 C, +Iso). Thus, the β2AR receptor is selectively sequestered in response to insulin stimulation, and the serine residues that can act as substrates for Akt-catalyzed phosphorylation are essential for the counterregulatory effects of insulin on the β2AR. We gathered additional data on the phosphorylation of Ser345, Ser346 sites of the β2AR by study of the receptors in vivo. Cells expressing the wild-type (WT) and the S345A/S346A (AA) double mutant form of the β2ARs were treated with insulin (100 nm), and the phosphorylation state of the receptors were established through immunoblotting with phosphoamino acid-specific antibodies, as outlined above. Whereas the wild-type receptor displayed increased protein phosphorylation, the AA mutant failed to show increased phosphoserine content in response to insulin (Fig. 5). Surprisingly, phosphotyrosine content of the AA double mutant receptor did not increase in response to insulin. These data suggest the possibility that the phosphorylation of the Ser345, Ser346 sites and the Tyr350 site may be hierarchical, linked in a manner whereby the phosphorylation of the Ser345, Ser346 sites influences phosphorylation of the Tyr350 residue. We further probed whether Akt mediates the action of insulin on the counterregulation of the β2AR through the use of a constitutively active form of Akt (T308D/S473D; CA-Akt). If Akt is a mediator of insulin action in this signaling pathway, we might expect that activation of Akt would be insulinomimetic (Fig. 6). Immunoblotting of cell extracts from CHO and A431 clones transfected with empty vector or the CA-Akt mutant revealed enhanced immunoreactivity for the clones expressing a mutant form of Akt (Fig. 6 A). Expression of the CA-Akt in these cells provoked a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation, much like insulin treatment (Fig. 6 B). The addition of insulin (100 nm) to the cells expressing the CA-Akt produced no further reduction in the isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP response. Complementary studies of β2AR localization revealed marked internalization of β2AR in cells expressing the CA-Akt, resembling the situation noted when the cells were treated with insulin. Addition of insulin failed to alter significantly the marked internalization of β2AR observed in the cells expressing CA-Akt (Fig. 6 C). These data suggest that with respect to the counterregulatory effects of insulin on β2AR action, CA-Akt is fully insulinomimetic. We made use of a dominant-negative strategy to test further the role of Akt on the counterregulatory influence of insulin on β2AR (Fig. 7). The mutant form (K179A/T308A/S473A) of Akt (DN-Akt) was expressed in the cells and the ability of insulin to inhibit β-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation (Fig. 7 A) and β2AR sequestration (Fig. 7 B) measured. Expression of DN-Akt itself resulted in a small reduction in the cyclic AMP response to isoproterenol (Fig. 6 A). For cells expressing the DN-Akt, the ability of insulin to counterregulate the β-adrenergic cyclic AMP response was abolished. Moreover, in the cells expressing DN-Akt, not only was the counterregulation by insulin abolished, but also treatment with insulin produced a significant increase in the cyclic AMP response. Analysis of β2AR localization in cells expressing DN-Akt revealed two novel features (Fig. 7 B). In comparison with the control cells, the cells expressing DN-Akt displayed somewhat more intracellular GFP-tagged β2AR (arrowheads) in the unstimulated state. This observation is not at all unexpected, because Akt is known to influence the trafficking of membrane proteins, such as GLUT4 glucose transporter. The DN-Akt may well suppress the counter movement of β2AR to the cell membrane from intracellular compartment. Surface GFP-tagged β2AR were also readily observed (arrows) in the cells expressing DN-Akt, but unlike the control cells, these cells did not display marked sequestration of β2AR from the cell membrane in response to insulin. Thus, expression of DN-Akt abolished the ability of insulin to counterregulate the β-adrenergic-stimulated cyclic AMP response as well as the ability of insulin to internalize β2AR. The current studies illuminate a novel role of Akt mediating insulin counteraction of catecholamine action. Earlier observations demonstrated the following: insulin stimulates inactivation of the β2AR through tyrosyl phosphorylation (10.Karoor V. Baltensperger K. Paul H. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25305-25308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar); phosphorylation of β2AR Tyr350 in response to insulin creates a SH2 binding site with which Grb2, dynamin, and the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase can interact (9.Baltensperger K. Karoor V. Paul H. Ruoho A. Czech M.P. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1061-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); and insulin stimulates marked sequestration of the β2AR, which requires the integrity of Tyr350 and activation of PI3-kinase (14.Karoor V. Wang L. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33035-33041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Herein we show that Akt plays an obligate role for insulin signaling to the β2AR. Elimination of an Akt phosphorylation motif renders the β2AR insensitive to counterregulation by insulin and unable to be sequestered in response to insulin. Expression of dominant-negative Akt blocks the ability of insulin to sequester β2AR, whereas expression of a constitutively active Akt mimics the effects of insulin on β2AR sequestration. Akt is well known to regulate endosomal trafficking, acting in concert with EEA1 and Rab5 (3.Corvera S. Czech M.P. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 442-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Akt activation results in a shuttling of the insulin-sensitive GLUT4 transporter-laden vesicles to the cell membrane. In a similar manner, Akt may be causing shuttling of newly formed, phospho-β2AR-laden vesicles to intracellular locales. For agonist-stimulated sequestration of β2AR, both the serine-threonine kinases, protein kinase A and GRK, function to traffic receptors from the cell membrane to endosomes for re-cycling or degradation (15.Morris A.J. Malbon C.C. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1373-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). For insulin-stimulated sequestration, Akt appears to play an analogous role trafficking β2AR to intracellular locales (Fig. 8). Insulin stimulates its receptor to autophosphorylate, phosphorylate the β2AR at Tyr350, Tyr354, and Tyr360, as well as IRS1,2, to thereby activate PI3-kinase activity. Activation of PI3-kinase leads to activation of PDK1 and downstream to activation of Akt. Akt, in turn, phosphorylates the β2AR on an Akt canonical site located in the cytoplasmic, C-terminal tail and provokes the sequestration and internalization of the β2AR. The interplay between PI3-kinase, Akt, and endosomal elements with the β2AR seems to be quite complex and will require further understanding of the intracellular trafficking pathways. We thank Dr. Philip Cohen (Department of Biochemistry, University of Dundee, Scotland, UK) for providing to us the dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of Akt2."

Our previous studies established that neuronal restriction of dynamin I gene expression is controlled by Sp1 and nuclear factor-κB-like element-1. Here, using a series of deletion constructs and site-directed mutation, we found that transcription of dynamin I gene during neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells is controlled primarily by the Sp1 element located between −13 to −4 bp of the dynamin I promoter. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that in addition to Sp1, Sp3 could interact with this Sp1 element. The requirement for Sp family transcription factors in dynamin I gene expression was confirmed by using mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1/Sp3 binding. Mithramycin repressed dynamin I gene expression and resulted in blocking of neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells. The localization of the dynamin I protein was also restricted in the peripheral region of the nucleus by the mithramycin treatment.

Dynamin is a GTPase protein that is believed to play a key role in detaching clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane (1.Schmid S.L. Annu. Rev.

Neurochem. 1996; 67: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)) are expressed simultaneously. It has been known that the mRNA levels of dynamin I and III are up-regulated throughout brain development, whereas the levels of dynamin II mRNA remain unchanged (12.Cook T. Mesa K. Urrutia R. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13.Faire K. Trent F. Tepper J.M. Bonder E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Therefore, understanding the regulation mechanism that confers cell type- and development stage-specific expression of dynamin I is important to know the in vivo role of this protein. To understand the molecular mechanism of tissue-specific dynamin I gene expression, we previously cloned and analyzed the 5′-flanking regions of the mouse dynamin I gene and reported that Sp1, NF-κB-like element (NE) 1The abbreviations used are: NENF-κB-like elementCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasePBSphosphate-buffered salineEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayAbantibody -1, and neuron restrictive silencer element are required for the promoter activity of dynamin I gene in neuronal cells (14.Yoo J.

We also reported that YY1 binds to the negative regulatory region of the dynamin I gene promoter and strongly represses dynamin I promoter activity (16.Yoo J. Jeong M.J. Lee S.S. Lee K.I. Kwon B.M.

Previously, Torre et al. reported that dynamin I levels increase steadily with the formation of neurites and decrease during the serum-induced neurite retraction in the N1E-115 cells (20.Torre E. McNiven M.A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, a reduction in the intracellular level of dynamin in the hippocampal neurons through antisense oligonucleotide treatment results in a significant impairment in neurite formation. Therefore, these results provided convincing evidence demonstrating that dynamin I is required for normal neuritogenesis. To study the molecular mechanism of the up-regulation of dynamin I gene expression during the differentiation of N1E-115 cells, we analyzed the promoter activity of the dynamin I gene in this cell. Deletion analysis in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis showed that an Sp1 site at −14 to −7 is critical for Me2SO-induced dynamin I promoter activity. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that in addition to Sp1, Sp3 could interact with this Sp1 element. We also confirmed that Sp family transcription factors are functionally important since mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1/Sp3 binding (21.Greenwell P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), represses dynamin I gene expression. Furthermore, a reduction in the intracellular level of dynamin I in N1E-115 cells through mithramycin treatment resulted in a significant impairment in neurite formation. These results provide evidence that the dynamin I gene is transcriptionally activated during Me2SO-induced neuronal differentiation of N1E-115 cells through an Sp1 element, and this activation is essential for neuronal differentiation of the N1E-115 cells. All of the deletion and mutant constructs of the dynamin I promoter used in this study were previously described (14.Yoo J. Lee S.S. Jeong M.J. Lee K.I. Kwon B.M. Kim S.H. Park Y.M. Han M.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N1E-115 cells were passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g of glucose/liter and supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. All culture media contained 100 units of penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were subcultured from confluent dishes by diluting the cells 1:4 with fresh medium 3 days prior to transfection. All of the dynamin I promoter constructs were transfected into N1E-115 cells by means of FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cells were allowed to adhere to the dish for 12 h; 1.5% Me2SO was added to one dish of each pair, and the cells were incubated for an additional 48 h. To prepare cell extracts for CAT and β-galactosidase expression assay, cells were scraped and centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.8, and then subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles. Cell debris was centrifuged at 4 °C for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and used directly in the assays. β-Galactosidase assay was carried out using a chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to normalize CAT activities. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using 10 μl of cell extract in a reaction mixture consisting of 2.5 mm chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside and 1.25 mmMgCl2. After incubation for 0.5–1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 mmZnCl2, and the absorbance of reaction product was read at 574 nm. CAT activity was determined using 50–100 μl of cell extract in the presence of acetyl-CoA and [14C]chloramphenicol in a total volume of 150 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, extracted with ethyl acetate, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. Acetylated and non-acetylated forms of [14C]chloramphenicol were resuspended in 20 μl of ethyl acetate and separated by thin-layer chromatography for 30 min at room temperature with chloroform/methanol (97:3, v/v) as the mobile phase. Percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms was determined using phosphorimaging. Total RNA was prepared from N1E-115 cells grown either in the presence or absence of Me2SO. Mithramycin (200 nm) was cotreated with Me2SO for 48 h. Five micrograms of total RNA were mixed with 300 ng of oligo(dT) primer and heated at 65 °C for 5 min, cooled slowly at room temperature, and then reverse transcribed using StrataScript reverse transcriptase (Stratagene) at 42 °C for 1 h as recommended by the supplier. One-tenth of the reverse-transcribed mixture was PCR-amplified using forward primer 5′-TCTGAAGCTGCGTGATGTG-3′ (+1694 to +1713) and reverse primer 5′-CATCGAGTGCATGAAGCTGT-3′ (+1941 to +1922) relative to the first ATG in the coding sequence of the dynamin I gene. Thirty cycles of PCR were done at 94 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. N1E-115 cells were propagated as described for transfection analysis and treated with 1.5% Me2SO or grown under control conditions in 15-cm dishes. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2). The cells were incubated on ice for 15 min, and the nuclei were then pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 ×g at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol). The cells were incubated on ice for 30 min and pelleted by centrifugation for 20 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was recovered as the nuclear extract and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay, 8 μg of nuclear extract proteins were mixed with the binding buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin,leupeptin, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)). Double stranded32P-labeled oligonucleotides containing an Sp1 sequence were used as a probe. In the competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligomers (wild and mutated Sp1 oligonucleotides) were incubated with the nuclear extracts before addition of32P-labeled oligonucleotides. For supershift analysis, 1 μl of antibody specific for Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, or Sp4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated with nuclear extract proteins for 1 h at 4 °C before addition of the DNA probe. To block Sp1 binding to DNA, DNA probes were preincubated for 1 h at 4 °C with mithramycin (200 nm) before being used in binding reactions. Protein/DNA complexes were fractionated by electrophoresis in nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gels for normal EMSA experiments or in nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels for supershift analysis and visualized by autoradiography. The formation of neurites in N1E-115 cells by Me2SO treatment and blocking of neurites formation by different concentration of mithramycin (100–300 nm) treatment were monitored by inverted microscopy (Axiovert 25 microscope, Zeiss). Pictures were taken after 48 h of each treatment. For immunofluorescence assay, N1E-115 cells treated with different concentration of mithramycin were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h to 60% confluence. The coverslips were rinsed briefly in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde fixative, followed by permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were blocked with 1.0% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with monoclonal antibody against dynamin I (BD Transduction Laboratories) as primary antibody diluted in PBS containing 1.0% bovine serum albumin. After three washes in PBS, the coverslips were incubated with affinity-isolated secondary antibody (fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA). The coverslips were washed three times with PBS and mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO). Cells were observed for epifluorescence using a confocal laser scanning microscope (TCS400, LEICA, Inc.). Acquired images were manipulated with SCANware 5.0 (LEICA, Inc.) and digitized using Adobe PhotoShop Software (Adobe Photosystems, Inc., Mountain View, CA). All data are depicted as mean ± S.E. Differences between two groups were validated by Student's t test. It has been known that the dynamin levels increase during neurite formation in N1E-115 cells. To examine whether the activity of the mouse dynamin I promoter we previously cloned is activated during neurite formation, pCATIP931 containing a 931-bp 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse dynamin I gene (−931-+105) fused to the promoterless CAT gene in pCAT-Basic was transfected in N1E-115 cells, and the cells were either grown under control conditions or treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 48 h. To control for variations in transfection efficiency, pCMVβ plasmid was cotransfected, and β-galactosidase activity was used to standardize CAT activity. As seen in Fig. 1, Me2SO treatment resulted in a 4-fold increase in dynamin I promoter activity. To determine the region that is responsible for this induction, progressive 5′ deletion mutants of the dynamin I promoter were constructed, and their promoter activities were assayed in N1E-115 cells (Fig. 1). The response to Me2SO was maintained through deletion to −31. However, extension of the 5′ deletion to nt −1 drastically abrogated the response. These results indicate that the Me2SO regulatory region lies in the 30-bp region located between −30 and −1. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which expression of dynamin I is tissue specifically regulated, we previously cloned and characterized the promoter of mouse dynamin gene and reported that Sp1, NE-1, and neuron-restrictive silencer element are required for the promoter activity of dynamin I gene in neuronal cells (14.Yoo J. Lee S.S. Jeong M.J. Lee K.I. Kwon B.M. Kim S.H. Park Y.M. Han M.Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 661-668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Yoo J. Jeong M.J. Lee S.S. Lee K.I. Kwon B.M. Kim D.S. Park Y.M. Han M.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 928-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also reported that YY1 has a negative role in regulation of the dynamin I gene promoter activity (16.Yoo J. Jeong M.J. Lee S.S. Lee K.I. Kwon B.M. Park Y.M. Han M.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). One Sp1 DNA binding site is located in this Me2SO regulatory region (Fig. 2A). To define whether this element contributes to the response to Me2SO, the Sp1 binding site was mutated, and the effect of this mutation on promoter activity was determined. Mutation of the Sp1 binding site in pCATIP30 nearly abrogated the response to Me2SO (Fig. 2B). This result suggests that the Sp1 binding site is critical for the Me2SO-induced dynamin I promoter activity. To examine protein binding to this element, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays with a radiolabeled Sp1 element located in the Me2SO regulatory region as a probe and extracts from N1E-115 cells either grown under control conditions or treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 48 h. We found that this probe specifically binds to protein complexes designated as C1 to C3 from N1E-115 cells either grown under control conditions or treated with 1.5% Me2SO (Fig. 3A). Complex formation was inhibited specifically by adding excess amounts of unlabeled Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 5) but not by the Sp1 mutant oligonucleotide (lane 3 and 6). To confirm that Sp1 binds to this element, we performed EMSA in the presence of Sp family antibodies to demonstrate supershifting. An oligonucleotide containing the Sp1 element located in the Me2SO regulatory region was incubated with nuclear extracts from N1E-115 cells treated with 1.5% Me2SO and Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies (Fig. 3B). Supershift assays demonstrated that complex C1 disappeared with an anti-Sp1 Ab (lanes 2 and 4), revealing a further shifted complex (lanes 2 and 4, Sp1 (C1)). Complexes C2 and C3 also disappeared with the anti-Sp3 Ab (lanes 3 and 4) with a new shifted complex appearing (lanes 3 and 4, Sp3 (C2)). Two complexes disappeared with the anti-Sp3 Ab, suggesting that this Ab binds to two different sized Sp3 as described previously (22.Hagen G. Müller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, only one further shifted band was observed (lane 3, Sp3 (C2)). It is conceivable that a further shifted band is located, and thus not detected, in the same position as complex C1. Indeed, a weak band was observed at the same position as C1 with anti-Sp1 and -Sp3 Abs (lane 4, Sp3 (C3)). Incubation of the binding reactions with either anti-Sp2 or anti-Sp4 antibodies did not affect the EMSA pattern (Fig. 3C). All of these results suggested that Sp1 and Sp3 bind to the Sp1 element spanning −13 to −4, and this element is critical for the Me2SO-induced dynamin I promoter activity. To further investigate the role of Sp family on the regulation of dynamin I expression, we analyzed the effects of mithramycin, a drug that modifies GC-rich regions of the DNA and blocks Sp1 binding (21.Greenwell P. Inagaki Y. Hu W. Walsh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19738-19745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), on the expression of dynamin I in N1E-115 cells induced by Me2SO. As shown in Fig. 4, Me2SO induced dynamin I gene expression about 5-fold (Fig. 4, A, B, lane 2) but cotreatment of mithramycin with Me2SO completely abolished the accumulation of dynamin I mRNA in Me2SO-induced N1E-115 cells (Fig. 4, A, B, lane 3), which strongly suggests that Sp1 binding is essential for dynamin I expression. In gel shift experiments performed in the presence or absence of mithramycin, we confirmed that the drug inhibited Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the Sp1 element spanning −13 to −4 (Fig. 5A). To confirm whether dynamin I promoter activity is also repressed by treatment of mithramycin, we determined dynamin I promoter activity in the presence of mithramycin (Fig. 5B). Treatment of mithramycin with Me2SO completely reduced pCATIP30 activity but not pCATIP30mSp1 activity. These results clearly suggest that mithramycin abolished dynamin I gene expression by repressing the binding between Sp family transcription factors and the Sp1 element in dynamin I promoter.Figure 5Mithramycin blocks Sp1/Sp3 binding and dynamin I promoter activity. A, Sp1 oligonucleotide, spanning nt −13 to −4, was preincubated in the presence of mithramycin (200 nm, lane 4) at 4 °C for 1 h and subsequently used in gel shift analysis with nuclear extracts from N1E-115 cells that had been treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 48 h. Complexes (C1–C3) with Sp1 or Sp3 are indicated. B, effect of mithramycin on dynamin I promoter activity. N1E-115 cells were transfected with either pCATIP30 (lane 1) or pCATIP30mSp1 (lane 2) construct and treated with Me2SO in the presence (white bars) or absence (black bars) of mithramycin for 48 h. The cells were harvested, extracts were prepared, CAT and β-galactosidase activities were determined, and β-galactosidase activity was used to correct for variations in transfection efficiency. Each data point represents the mean ± S.E., and data was obtained in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been known that normal levels of dynamin I are necessary for the formation of neurites in cultured hippocampal neurons. Therefore, we reduced the intracellular level of dynamin I in N1E-115 cells by mithramycin treatment and measured the effect on neurite outgrowth. As shown in Fig. 6, the morphology of N1E-115 cells was altered dramatically in the presence of increasing concentrations of mithramycin. In the mithramycin-treated cells, a significant reduction in the number and length of neurites was observed (Fig. 6, c–e). This inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth was dose-dependent. We also observed that the localization of dynamin is restricted in peripheral region of nuclear in mithramycin-treated cells (Fig. 7, c–e), whereas dynamin I proteins are dispersed in cytoplasm and cell processes including neurites in differentiated cells (Fig. 7b). All of these results definitely suggest that induction of dynamin I gene expression and exact localization are critical for neurite formation.Figure 7Localization of dynamin I protein was changed by treatment of mithramycin. In differentiated cells dynamin I proteins are dispersed in cytoplasm and cell processes including neurites (b, closed arrows); however, in mithramycin-treated cells (c, 100 nm;d, 200 nm; e, 300 nm) their distribution was restricted in the peripheral region of the nucleus (c, d, e, closed arrows). a, cells were grown under control condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been known that dynamin I mRNA and protein levels increase during differentiation of N1E-115 cells and that normal levels of dynamin I are necessary for the formation of neurites (20.Torre E. McNiven M.A. Urrutia R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32411-32417Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we found that an Sp1 element located between −13 to −4 bp of the dynamin I promoter is responsible for a major part of dynamin I promoter activity during differentiation of N1E-115 cells, and Sp3 as well as Sp1 bound to this element. We also confirmed the importance of the Sp1 element by using mithramycin, a drug that modifies GC-rich regions of the DNA and blocks Sp1/Sp3 binding. Treatment of mithramycin inhibited Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the Sp1 element and completely abolished the accumulation of dynamin I mRNA and promoter activity in Me2SO-induced N1E-115 cells, which strongly suggests that Sp1/Sp3 binding is essential for dynamin I expression. Blocking of dynamin I gene expression by mithramycin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of neurite formation. The localization of dynamin also changed from cytoplasm and cell processes including neurites to peripheral region of nuclear. All of these results clearly suggest that induction of dynamin I gene expression and exact localization are critical for neurite formation. Dynamin is a GTPase that plays a critical role in endocytosis. Although the majority of studies implicate dynamin in endocytosis, there are many evidences to suggest that dynamin may play additional functions in cell physiology. Recently, many observations also link dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton. When the dynamin K44A mutant is overexpressed, the distribution of actin stress fibers and cell shape are altered (5.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 23.Altankov G. Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1449-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Dynamin was shown to colocalize with filamentous actin at membrane ruffles (24.Cao H. Garcia F. McNiven M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2595-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and also detected at podosomes (25.Ochoa G.-C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). They also suggested that a direct functional link of dynamin to the actin cytoskeleton exists (25.Ochoa G.-C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. DeCamilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). All of these results and our results are convergent with those of recent studies reporting that dynamin directly binds regulatory components of the actin cytoskeleton, such as profilin (26.Witke W.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Sp1 is a well characterized sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that is important for transcription of many cellular and viral genes that contain GC boxes in their promoters (31.Coury A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 32.Suske G. Gene. 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Three Sp1-related transcription factors (Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4) have been cloned. Sp2 does not recognize the same sequence as Sp1, and Sp4 expression is restricted to the brain. Sp3, on the other hand, is ubiquitously expressed and recognizes the same sequence as Sp1. Although Sp1 appears to be almost exclusively an activating transcription factor, Sp3 contains a transcriptional repression domain and can act as a transcriptional activator or repressor depending on the promoter and cell type studied (33.Dennig J. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5659-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 34.Majello B. De Luca P. Lania L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4021-4026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). While Sp1 and Sp3 are ubiquitous nuclear factors, the differences in the level of expression during different stages of development (35.Ammendola R. Mesuraca M. Russo T. Cimino F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17944-17948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Saffer J.D. Jackson S.P. Annarella M.B. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2189-2199Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar) along with specific posttranslational modifications (37.Daniel S. Zhang S. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Kim K.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14692-14697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) are responsible for altering gene transcription in a development-specific and cell-specific manner. In addition, despite its general role in transcription of housekeeping genes, Sp1 has been demonstrated to be involved in induced transcription of various genes responding to different biological stimuli (38.Xiao H. Hasegawam T. Isobe K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1371-1376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 39.Lee T.H. Chuang L.Y. Hung W.C.

However, total amounts of Sp1 and Sp3 proteins were not changed regardless of the differentiation state of N1E-115 cells, and they bound to the Sp1 element spanning −13 to −4 not only in Me2SO-induced cells but also in control cells (Fig. 3A). It is still possible that other Me2SO-inducible transcription factors weakly bind to this element and enhance the promoter activity. Another possibility is that binding of some Me2SO-inducible transcription factors to their binding sites is dependent on the interaction with Sp1 or Sp3. It has been reported that transient interaction of Purα and Sp1 may result in stable association of Purα to its binding element, and these factors synergistically stimulate MBP promoter activity in central nervous system cells (41.Tretiakova A. Steplewski A. Johnson E.M. Khalili K. Amini S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 169-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, further studies involving identification of proteins that bind with Sp1 or Sp3 will facilitate elucidation of the dynamin I gene expression."

VIP also modulates several T lymphocyte activities including motility, cytokine production, proliferation, and apoptosis (6.Xia M. Gaufo G.O. Wang Q. Sreedharan S.P. Goetzl E.J. J.

VIP exerts its biological activity by binding (Kd, 1–10 μm) to two closely related class II G-protein-coupled receptors designated VPAC-1 and VPAC-2 with structural similarities to receptors for glucagon, secretin, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin (2.Dorsam G.

In addition, immune cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes constitutively express VPAC-1 (2.Dorsam G. Voice J. Kong Y. Goetzl E.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Naı̈ve human CD4+ T cells express VPAC-1 at levels 10-fold higher than CD8+ T cells and down-regulate this receptor by greater than 70% within 10 h of TCR-mediated activation. Thus, VPAC-1 levels may be indicative of the activation status and thus represent a naı̈ve CD4+ T cell surface marker (13.Lara-Marquez M. O'Dorisio M. O'Dorisio T. Shah M. Karacay B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2522-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We have identified four high affinity Ikaros binding elements located within 550 bp of the transcriptional start site of the human VPAC-1 promoter. Ikaros is a hemolymphopoietic restricted zinc finger transcription factor and is absolutely necessary for the proper ontogeny of lymphocytes (for review see Refs.14 and 15). The Ikaros gene is highly conserved between rodent and man and generates at least eight isoforms through alternative splicing (14.Cortes M. Wong E. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All Ikaros isoforms have a common C terminus containing a bipartite transcriptional activation domain and two zinc fingers that facilitate dimerization with other Ikaros isoforms. All eight isoforms, however, differ in their N-terminal domain, which consists of four zinc fingers, three of which are necessary to bind DNA with high affinity. Thus, only IK-1, IK-2, and IK-3 demonstrate high affinity DNA binding, while IK-4 through IK-8 have little to no DNA binding (16.Georgopoulos K. Bigby M. Wang J.H. Molnar A. Wu P. Winandy S. Sharpe A. Cell. 1994; 79: 143-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 17.Molnar A. Georgopoulos K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8292-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Ikaros homo- or heterodimers recognize the sequence TGGGA(A/T), where the core GGGA sequence is more important than flanking nucleotides. Non-DNA-binding isoforms (IK-4–8) generating heterodimers with DNA-binding isoforms (IK-1–3) do not bind DNA and are transcriptionally inactive. Consequently, non-DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms act in a dominant negative fashion (18.Molnar A. Wu P. Largespada D.A. Vortkamp A. Scherer S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Bruns G. Georgopoulos K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). This study began by an analysis of 1400 bp of the 5′-flanking region of human VPAC-1 that revealed four high affinity Ikaros binding motifs (TGGGA(A/T)) and 20 additional Ikaros core binding elements (GGGA). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using Jurkat T cell nuclear extracts or recombinant Ikaros protein generated a sequence-specific retardation signal, which was further shifted by an anti-Ikaros antibody. Therefore, we hypothesized that the predominant DNA-binding Ikaros isoforms expressed in CD4+ T lymphocytes, IK-1 and IK-2, may regulate endogenous levels of VPAC-1 receptor. To this end, stable Ikaros NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblast clones overexpressing IK-1 and IK-2 isoforms were generated, and endogenous levels of VPAC-1 expression were quantified by traditional and fluorometric-based kinetic RT-PCR and 125I-labeled VIP binding. Endogenous VPAC-1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced (50–93%) compared with vector control. Luciferase reporter assays utilizing nested VPAC-1-deleted constructs further confirmed transcriptional down-regulation of VPAC-1 expression and identified two IK-2 regulatory domains of 453 and 187 bp, respectively. These data strongly suggest that VPAC-1 is a novel gene target for Ikaros and may mediate VPAC-1 regulation in the immune compartment.

M2 anti-FLAG antibody, normal rabbit serum, dibutyl phthalate, and all other reagents used for buffers were purchased from Sigma. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously by Dorsam et al. (19.Dorsam G. Taher M.M. Valerie K.C. Kuemmerle N.B. Chan J.C. Franson R.C. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 271-279PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were lysed with 100 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and nuclei were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer lacking Nonidet P-40. Nuclear extraction buffer (250 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was used to resuspend nuclei, and after centrifuging at 13,000 × g for 15 min, supernatants (nuclear extracts) were collected. A 28-bp double-stranded DNA probe known to recognize all Ikaros DNA-binding isoforms and containing two inverted Ikaros binding sites (IK-oligo; 5′-TCAGCTTTTGGGAATGTATTCCCTGTCA-3′) was used as a positive control. A 24-bp DNA probe containing an Ikaros binding element found in the human VPAC-1 promoter (VPAC-1 probe; 5′-CTCGCAGCCTGGGAAGATAAGTGG-3′) was labeled for 30 min along with IK-oligo with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP, then phenol/chloroform was extracted, and ethanol was precipitated. The binding reaction consisted of 5 μg of nuclear or partially purified Ikaros recombinant protein, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.1 ng of 32P-labeled probe with or without unlabeled probe and with or without 1 μg of anti-Ikaros serum in 5% glycerol (binding reaction) and was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved on a 5% PAGE gel in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer with 40 V for 2 h. Gels were dried for 45 min under vacuum and exposed to x-ray film. WI-38 cells were grown in 88% (v/v) DME-21, Jurkat T cells were grown in 88% RPMI, and both media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, 1× Glutamax II and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Stable Ikaros NIH-3T3 clones were cultured in WI-38 media supplemented with 500 μg/ml Geneticin (G418). Ikaros cDNAs encoding for isoforms 1 and 2 (a kind gift from Dr. Katia Georgopoulos) were amplified by PCR using specific primers containing 5′-BamHI and 3′-HindIII overhangs. Each reaction was catalyzed by the high fidelity Pfu Taqpolymerase. Amplified PCR products were ligated into the TOPO blunt cloning vector. Positive clones were isolated and sequenced bidirectionally with T7/Sp6 primers. Only Ikaros cDNAs that matched the published murine Ikaros cDNA sequences were used. Both Ikaros cDNAs were subsequently subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV-Tag2B (IK-pCMV-Tag2B) and the bacterial expression vector pGXT-2TK (IK-GXT-2TK) by digesting all DNA species withBamHI/HindIII and ligating with T4 ligase at a 15:1 insert/vector ratio. Isolated subcloned vectors were sequenced to verify polymerase fidelity, and microgram quantities were amplified and isolated. IK-pCMV-Tag2B was used to generate NIH-3T3 stable clones, and IK-GXT-2TK was used to generate recombinant IK-1 and IK-2 proteins. Subconfluent (50%) NIH-3T3 cells in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.7 μg of IK-pCMV-Tag2B (IK-1 or IK-2), luciferase-pCMV-Tag2B, or empty pCMV-Tag2B vector by the LipofectAMINE Plus technique as described by the manufacturer. Addition of the antibiotic Geneticin (G418) was added to the growth media at 500 μg/ml 48 h after transfection. Surviving cells were cloned by cell sorting one propidium iodide-stained viable cell per well in 96-well plates. Clones were analyzed by traditional RT-PCR, fluorescence-activated cell sorter (data not shown), and Western blot analysis (data not shown) to verify expression of FLAG-tagged Ikaros recombinant expression. Positive clones were expanded, and all experiments were performed between passages 4 and 10 after expansion. Competent Top10 bacteria were transformed with the IK-GXT-2TK expression vector and induced by 100 mg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight at room temperature. Bacterial cells were pelleted and lysed by sonicating in 8 m urea, 100 mm Tris, 150 mmNaCl buffer. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g in a JA-17 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing recombinant GST-linked IK-1 or IK-2 protein were dialyzed against 1× PBS (4 liters) to refold recombinant Ikaros protein, and this partially purified Ikaros protein was used in subsequent EMSA experiments. VPAC-1 luciferase constructs with deleted 5′ or internal sequences were generated from human VPAC-1 5′-flanking sequence isolated from a human placenta genomic library (20.Speedharan S.P. Huang J. Chung M. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U./S./A. 1995; 92: 2939-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Restriction endonuclease digestion liberated either 5′ or internally deleted nested VPAC-1 5′-flanking sequences. These deleted sequences were subcloned into the pGl-2 basic luciferase vector as described by the manufacturer. Nested deleted VPAC-1 luciferase constructs or pGL-2 basic vector were transfected into subconfluent (50%) NIH-3T3 stable Ikaros-2 or vector clones by the LipofectAMINE Plus or LipofectAMINE 2000 procedure as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were transfected in Opti-Mem for 5 h in the absence of serum. Cells were washed once with 1× PBS, and normal growth media were added. Cells were washed 24 h later with 1× PBS and lysed with 1× passive lysis buffer, and luciferase activity was measured by a 96-well Microlumat Plus luminometer for 15 s/well. Firefly luciferase activity was normalized withRenilla luciferase and represented as -fold activation over pGl-2 luciferase control vector. Confluent NIH-3T3 wild type and stable clones were trypsinized from tissue culture plates, centrifuged, washed with 1× PBS, and lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol®. Total RNA was isolated as described by the manufacturer and quantitated by optical density, and 0.5–5.0 μg of DNase-treated total RNA was used to generate first strand cDNA using reverse transcriptase. Ikaros message was amplified using primers specific to exons 2 and 7 (5′-CCC CTG TAA GCG ATA CCC CAG ATG; 5′-GAT GGC TTG GTC CAT CAC GTG GGA), respectively. Expected sizes for the Ikaros PCR products were 891 bp for IK-1 and 629 bp for IK-2. PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide fluorescence. The PCR reaction conditions were: 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 63 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 35–40 cycles. Reactions contained 10 μl of DNase-treated total RNA template or RNase-free H2O with 15 μl of a 1.67× master mix (final concentrations: 4% glycerol, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.01% gelatin, 1× AmpliTaq Gold PCR buffer, 75 nm 5′-FAM-TTTTTTTT-ROX-3′ internal probe, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dATP, 200 μm dTTP, 200 μmdCTP, 200 μm dGTP, 300 μm forward (MVPAC-1, 5′-AACTTTAAGGCCCAGGTGAAAAT-3′; RGAPDH, 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′) and reverse primers (MVPAC-1, 5′-CCTGCACCTCGCCATTG-3′; RGAPDH, 5′-GGATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′), 200 nm 5′-labeled 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) or tetrachlorofluorescein (TET) and 3′-labeled quencher dye 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-labeled probe (MVPAC-1, 5′-FAM-TTGTGGTGGCCATCCTCTACTGCTTCC-TAMRA-3′; RGAPDH, 5′-TET-CAGAAGACTGTGGATGGCCCCTC-TAMRA-3′), 0.2 units/μl RNase inhibitor, 0.05 units/μl AmpliTaq gold polymerase, 0.5 units/μl Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase) for a final volume of 25 μl. Reactions for both amplicons were run in the absence of reverse transcriptase to ensure no genomic DNA contamination. The reaction was conducted by the following procedure: one cycle of 30 min at 48 °C (first strand cDNA synthesis), one cycle for 5 min at 99 °C (inactivate reverse transcriptase and activate AmpliTaq gold polymerase), one cycle for 2 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of denaturation for 15 s at 94 °C and annealing/extension for 1 min at 60 °C. Standard curves for both MVPAC-1 and RGAPDH were performed with every experiment, and coefficient of variance between runs for 5 μg of RNA template was 3.7 and 1.8%, respectively. Confluent clones were detached and lysed with 1 ml of TRIzol®, and total RNA was isolated as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA was DNase-treated for 30 min at room temperature, and 5 ng of template RNA was used for subsequent measurement of MVPAC-1 and RGAPDH. Reactions were read by a 7700 sequence detector thermocycler linked to a Macintosh G4 computer using the sequence detector software. All cycle threshold values were obtained in the linear range of both amplicons. Data was analyzed by the Student's ttest for independent samples. Coefficient of variance was determined by running independent experiments on three different days, and the precision of each standard curve was compared for each amplicon. Analysis of the proximal 1.4 kb of human and rat VPAC-1 5′-flanking sequences (promoter) revealed 24 and 32 GGGA Ikaros core binding elements, respectively. This frequency is 4.5- and 6-fold greater than expected based on a random nucleotide distribution. Aligning the transcriptional start sites of both species further showed that 22 of these Ikaros core binding elements spatially matched. The human VPAC-1 promoter also contains four high affinity Ikaros binding sites (Fig. 1). Consequently, we hypothesized that Ikaros binds to and transcriptionally regulates VPAC-1. EMSA demonstrated that protein from Jurkat T cells bound a 24-bp probe (VPAC-1 probe) containing a high affinity Ikaros binding site (TGGGAT) found in the human VPAC-1 promoter. As a positive control, a 28-bp probe (IK-oligo) containing two inverted, high affinity Ikaros binding sites generated a similar retardation signal as the VPAC-1 probe (Fig. 1). Nuclear protein from human WI-38 fibroblast cells, which do not express Ikaros, were used as a negative control and did not generate a detectable retardation signal with either Ikaros probe. The Ikaros retardation signal generated by nuclear protein from Jurkat T cells could be competed away by excess unlabeled probe indicating a sequence-specific interaction (Fig. 2A). A highly specific Ikaros polyclonal antibody that recognizes the C terminus common to all Ikaros isoforms supershifted both the VPAC-1 and IK-oligo probes, whereas normal serum did not (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, EMSA analysis showed that GST recombinant IK-1 and IK-2 isoforms recognized the VPAC-1 probe, were competed by both unlabeled VPAC-1 and IK-oligo probe, and were supershifted by anti-Ikaros (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate the in vitro binding of Ikaros to the VPAC-1 promoter. The functional consequences of Ikaros binding to the promoter of VPAC-1 were investigated by measuring changes in endogenous VPAC-1 receptor levels in Ikaros NIH-3T3 fibroblast clones stably expressing IK-1 and IK-2 protein. Cloned transfectants were analyzed after expansion for Ikaros expression by traditional RT-PCR (Fig. 3C), fluorescence-activated cell sorter, and Western blot analysis (data not shown). By fluorometric-based kinetic RT-PCR, VPAC-1 mRNA expression was significantly lowered in stable clones overexpressing IK-1 (93%) and IK-2 (83%) isoforms compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Likewise, protein levels of VPAC-1 were significantly repressed (range = 54–60%, n = 3) as assessed by125I-labeled VIP binding (Fig. 3B). This decrease in VIP binding is a direct reflection of VPAC-1 protein because NIH-3T3 cells do not express detectable levels of VPAC-2 by traditional RT-PCR (Fig. 3C). To confirm that this modulation of VPAC-1 expression was at the transcriptional level, we transiently transfected several VPAC-1 luciferase reporter constructs with defined deletions into IK-2 stable clones or vector control. The luciferase activity was repressed with several of the VPAC-1 deleted constructs compared with vector control. The Ikaros-mediated decreases were up to 41% in this reporter system (Fig. 4). In addition, two major IK-2 regulatory domains were identified in the VPAC-1 promoter at regions distal (−1076 to −623 bp) and proximal (−222 to −35 bp) to the transcriptional start site. Reporter assays were performed in IK-2 clones, which are similar to IK-1 clones in DNA binding activity and function, but were more stable in culture.Figure 4Luciferase reporter assay using VPAC-1 nested 5′ or internally deleted constructs to measure the effect of Ikaros on the transcriptional activity of VPAC-1. Subconfluent Ikaros-2 and vector clones were transiently transfected with either the pGL-2 luciferase vector or various nested 5′ or internal deleted VPAC-1 promoter/pGl-2 constructs. Data are represented as -fold increase of luciferase activity normalized by Renilla luciferase activity and compared with pGL-2 control. Asterisks indicate a significant decrease in luciferase activity with a pvalue ≤ 0.05. Data are presented as the mean of luciferase activity ± S.E. and are representative of four separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The capacity of the hemolymphopoietic transcription factors IK-1 and IK-2 to down-regulate VPAC-1, a G-protein-coupled receptor for VIP, is attributed to the presence of functional, high affinity Ikaros binding elements in the VPAC-1 promoter (Fig. 1). Because mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts do not express Ikaros, the isolated introduction of IK-1 or IK-2 by transfection assumes association with their DNA binding elements found in promoters of Ikaros target genes. Specific down-regulation of endogenous VPAC-1 receptors in Ikaros stable NIH-3T3 clones was demonstrated by several quantitative measurements at both at the mRNA and protein levels. To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of a link between a master regulator of the development and maintenance of T and B cells and the transcriptional regulation of a neuropeptide receptor constitutively expressed in the immune system. The observation that human and rat VPAC-1 promoters contain a tetrad of high affinity Ikaros binding elements introduces VPAC-1 into the cluster of T cell genes also containing high affinity Ikaros binding motifs, such as CD2, CD3, IL-2Rα, NF-κB, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (18.Molnar A. Wu P. Largespada D.A. Vortkamp A. Scherer S. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Bruns G. Georgopoulos K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 585-592PubMed Google Scholar). The high frequency of additional Ikaros core binding elements conserved between rodent and man further strengthens the importance of Ikaros transcriptional regulation of VPAC-1. By luciferase reporter analysis using 5′ or internal VPAC-1 nested deleted constructs, two IK-2 regulatory domains spanning 453 bp (distal region; −1076 to −623 bp) and 187 bp (proximal region; −222 to −35 bp) were identified. The distal domain contains 10 Ikaros core binding elements, whereas the proximal region contains one high affinity and two Ikaros core binding elements (Figs. 1 and 4). Both domains repress luciferase activity, with the distal domain showing greater repression (41 versus 30%). Interestingly, these two IK-2 regulatory domains correlate with only one of the four high affinity Ikaros binding elements. This binding element is within the VPAC-1 minimal promoter and overlaps a crucial Sp-1 binding site (21.Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Carrero I. Leburthe M. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 623-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Madsen B. Georg B. Madsen M.W. Fahrenkrug J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2001; 172: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, IK-2, and presumably IK-1, may compete for this SP-1 binding site and cause transcriptional repression when overexpressed in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. It has been demonstrated that Ikaros can compete for other binding sites and displace transcription factors such as ETS-1 (23.Trinh L.A. Ferrini R. Cobb B.S. Weinmann A.S. Hahn K. Ernst P. Garraway I.P. Merkenschlager M. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1817-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). A major future goal is to identify which of these Ikaros binding elements are functionally active. Ikaros has been shown to both activate and suppress transcription in transient reporter assays designed to detect specific recognition of synthesized tandem repeats of high affinity Ikaros DNA binding elements (24.Koipally J. Renold A. Kim J. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3090-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The presence of Ikaros binding sites in T cell-specific genes suggests a classical transactivating role for Ikaros, which has been demonstrated for VPAC-1 (25.Sabbattini P. Lundgren M. Georgiou A. Chow C. Warnes G. Dillon N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, Ikaros can also interact with centromeric heterochromatin and co-localize with transcriptionally silenced genes, suggesting that Ikaros can physically interact with certain gene promoters to silence their expression by promoting translocation to transcriptionally refractory nuclear compartments (26.Brown K.E. Guest S.S. Smale S.T. Hahm K. Merkenschlager M. Fisher A.G. Cell. 1997; 91: 845-854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Ikaros may repress transcription by at least two other mechanisms, which include recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes and the engagement of the co-repressor CtBP (20.Speedharan S.P. Huang J. Chung M. Goetzl E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U./S./A. 1995; 92: 2939-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27.Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). With respect to the first possibility, it is noteworthy that the transcriptional rate of VPAC-1 is up-regulated by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (data not shown) in numerous cell types including NIH-3T3 and Jurkat T cells. This may suggest that the extent of acetylation of critical nuclear proteins, such as histones, may be an important mechanism for the regulation of VPAC-1. Therefore, we propose that Ikaros may recruit additional HDAC enzymes to the promoter of VPAC-1 when overexpressed in NIH-3T3 cells and shift the equilibrium toward a hypoacetylated state, which thus silences transcription. Whether this down-regulation of VPAC-1 by Ikaros is also associated with its localization in heterochromatin will be the focus of future research. VPAC-1 is constitutively expressed on human, naı̈ve CD4+ T cells of immune tissues (2.Dorsam G. Voice J. Kong Y. Goetzl E.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 921: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12.Danek A. O'Dorisio M.S. O'Dorisio T.M. George J.M. J. Immunol. 1983; 131: 1173-1177PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Lara-Marquez M. O'Dorisio M. O'Dorisio T. Shah M. Karacay B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2522-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). VIP represses TCR-mediated activation of human CD4+ T cells and IL-2 generation initially through VPAC-1 receptor signaling (28.Xin Z. Tang H. Ganea D. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 54: 59-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). VPAC-1 is also down-regulated by more than 70% by TCR-mediated activation. These observations by our laboratory and others suggest that optimal activation of human CD4+ T cells may require the down-regulation of VPAC-1 receptors. Indeed, VPAC-1 has been suggested to play a role in suppressing bystander T cell activation (13.Lara-Marquez M. O'Dorisio M. O'Dorisio T. Shah M. Karacay B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2522-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Ikaros, which sets the threshold for TCR activation (29.Avitahl N. Winandy S. Friedrich C. Jones B. Ge Y. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 333-343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), is redistributed to heterochromatin during TCR-mediated activation of T cells (14.Cortes M. Wong E. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 15.Georgopoulos K. Winandy S. Avitahl N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 155-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Several Ikaros isoforms and other family members such as Aiolos and Helios, aggregate into a higher order, 2 MDa toroidal complex with chromatin remodeling nucleosome remodelling and deacetylase proteins and HDAC-1 and HDAC-2 enzymes (14.Cortes M. Wong E. Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar,30.Kim J. Sif S. Jones B. Jackson A. Koipally J. Heller E. Winandy S. Viel A. Sawyer A. Ikeda T. Kingston R. Georgopoulos K. Immunity. 1999; 10: 345-355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We surmise that the redistribution of Ikaros, bound to the VPAC-1 promoter, to regions of heterochromatin after TCR-induced activation of CD4+ T cells may mediate the observed specificity of VPAC-1 down-regulation. The high frequency of Ikaros core binding elements in the VPAC-1 promoter may therefore allow Ikaros to maintain high VPAC-1 expression in naı̈ve CD4+ T cells while silencing VPAC-1 expression and enabling full CD4+ T cell activation when recruited to heterochromatin."

Its ability to participate in the multistep catalytic process of DNA relaxation was investigated. His-365 was mutated to alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartate, glutamate, and glutamine to study its ability to participate in general acid/base catalysis and bind DNA. The mutants were examined for pH-dependent DNA relaxation and cleavage, salt-dependent DNA relaxation, and salt-dependent DNA binding affinity. The mutants relax DNA in a pH-dependent manner and at low salt concentrations. The pH dependence of all mutants is different from the wild type, suggesting that His-365 is responsible for the pH dependence of the enzyme. Additionally, whereas the wild type enzyme shows pH-dependent oligonucleotide cleavage, cleavage by both H365Q and H365A is pH-independent. H365Q cleaves DNA with rates similar to the wild type enzyme, whereas H365A has a slower rate of DNA cleavage than the wild type but can cleave more substrate overall. H365A also has a lower DNA binding affinity than the wild type enzyme. The binding affinity was determined at different salt concentrations, showing that the alanine mutant displaces half a charge less upon binding DNA than an inactive form of topoisomerase I.

This allows for the interconversion of topological isomers, which is necessary for nearly all cellular transactions of DNA such as replication, transcription, and recombination (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar). Type I enzymes are further divided into two subfamilies, type IA and type IB. Type IA DNA topoisomerases form a covalent linkage to the 5′-phosphoryl end of the cleaved DNA, whereas type IB DNA topoisomerases undergo a transesterification reaction to the 3′-phosphoryl end. All topoisomerases cleave the phosphodiester bond via a phosphotyrosine intermediate. For a recent review see Ref.2.Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar. Creation of the transient break, strand passage, and re-ligation of DNA by type IA topoisomerases is a multistep process. A proposed mechanism (3.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) has the following steps. 1) The enzyme recognizes and binds a single-stranded DNA region, positioning the DNA in the active site. 2) Cleavage of the single-stranded DNA occurs at the active site, via formation of a covalent bond between the 5′-phosphoryl and the hydroxyl of the active site tyrosine, whereas the 3′ end of the DNA remains non-covalently bound to the enzyme. 3) The enzyme opens to allow passage of the other strand through the gap or gate created by separating the broken ends of the cleaved DNA. 4) Following strand passage, the enzyme closes, trapping the passing DNA inside. 5) Once the gate is closed, the enzyme re-ligates the cleaved strand. 6) The enzyme opens to release both the re-ligated strand and the one that was passed through the gap. Escherichia coli DNA topoisomerase I is a member of the type IA subfamily of topoisomerases (1.Wang J.C. Annu. Rev.

Near the active site are many highly conserved residues as follows: Glu-9, Asp-111, Asp-113, Glu-115, Tyr-312, Glu-313, Arg-321, and His-365 (Fig. 1). The three-dimensional structure as well as mutagenesis studies suggest that many of these conserved residues are involved in the catalytic mechanism (3.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 10.Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8783-8789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although Asp-111, Asp-113, and Glu-115 have been implicated in Mg(II) binding (12.Zhu C.X. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5318-5322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), in many instances the specific role of particular residues has not been definitively determined. Alanine substitution mutagenesis has been performed on Glu-9, His-33, Asp-111, Glu-115, Gln-309, Glu-313, Thr-318, Arg-321, Thr-322, Asp-323, His-365, and Thr-496 to identify their possible roles (10.Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Most mutations do not completely abolish relaxation activity. The exception is Glu-9. When substituted with an alanine, it cannot relax supercoiled DNA but retains reduced relaxation ability when replaced with a glutamine (10.Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role that these residues may be playing in the catalytic process has not been resolved. This is partially due to the fact that the role of some residues may not be immediately apparent when they are only tested for relaxation activity or cleavage, and hence it is important to elucidate their involvement in greater detail. For example, several possible roles have been suggested for the invariant histidine residue at position 365 (His-365). It could either act as a general base in acid/base catalysis (13.Mondragón A. DiGate R. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar), participate in binding to the DNA phosphodiester backbone (14.Feinberg H. Changela A. Mondragon A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), or serve as a proton donor in a charge-relay network (15.Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragon A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The histidine is neither close enough to Tyr-319 to interact directly with it (3.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) nor does it make direct contacts with nucleotides or DNA bound near the active site (14.Feinberg H. Changela A. Mondragon A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 15.Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragon A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is in a position that could affect DNA binding indirectly or it could change conformation to approach Tyr-319 (14.Feinberg H. Changela A. Mondragon A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In the structure of E. colitopoisomerase III complexed with DNA, the invariant histidine is part of a hydrogen-bonding network that may allow it to donate a proton to Asp-111 that could then relay the charge to Glu-9 (15.Changela A. DiGate R.J. Mondragon A. Nature. 2001; 411: 1077-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Mutagenesis studies have shown that changing the histidine to alanine does not abolish overall enzymatic activity (10.Chen S.J. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6050-6056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but the mutation results in a reduced level of relaxation activity. This makes residue His-365 an excellent candidate for an in-depth study. To determine whether His-365 (a) acts as a general base to abstract the hydroxyl proton from the active site tyrosine, Tyr-319; (b) protonates the 3′-OH of the leaving DNA strand as a general acid; (c) donates a proton to Glu-9 as part of a charge-relay network; or (d) participates in DNA binding, the residue was mutated to alanine, arginine, glutamine, asparagine, glutamate, and aspartate. The effect of pH and salt concentration on supercoiled DNA relaxation was examined. The rate of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide cleavage was compared at different pH values in order to determine the relative effect of the mutations (16.Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 29: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The DNA binding affinity under steady-state conditions was assessed using fluorescence polarization. Fluorescence polarization was also used to investigate DNA binding affinity at different salt concentrations and to determine the number of ionic charges displaced by topoisomerase I upon binding. The topA gene was amplified from plasmid pJW312 (17.Zumstein L. Wang J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) via PCR and inserted into the pET15b plasmid from Novagen. A unique NdeI restriction site was introduced with the primer 5′-GGACCATAGCATATGGGTAAAGCTCTTGTC-3′, and a unique XhoI restriction site was introduced with the primer 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATTTTTTTCCTTC-3′. The amplified product was inserted in-frame into the multiple cloning site of pET15b between the NdeI site and the XhoI site to create plasmid pHis97. This plasmid encodes the entire topoisomerase I protein with the addition of a 6-residue histidine tag and a linker region containing a thrombin cleavage site at the N terminus of the native protein. The accuracy of the subcloning was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Unique Site Elimination kit from Amersham Biosciences was used for the construction of the 67-kDa N-terminal mutants from plasmid pT67, which contains the 67-kDa N-terminal fragment of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST)1 (18.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1213-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These mutants were used for structure determination and for the binding assays. Plasmid pHis97 was used as a template for the construction of mutants used in the relaxation and cleavage assays. Full-length mutants of the histidine-tagged protein were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Each mutant contained a unique restriction site at the location of interest. Mutant identity was verified via DNA sequencing of the mutation site. Ten liters of E. coli DH5α cells containing the mutant plasmid were grown at 34 °C in a BioFlo IV fermentor (New Brunswick Scientific Co.). Expression of the protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Cells were lysed by a modified Brij/lysozyme procedure (19.Godson G.N. Sinsheimer R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 476-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) by incubation in 20% sucrose, 50 mm Tris, 25 mm EDTA, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.625 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.25 mg/ml lysozyme for 15 min. followed by addition of KCl and Brij-58 to a final concentration of 120 mm and 0.25%, respectively. The protein was separated from membranes and cellular DNA by ultracentrifugation at 113,613 × g (40,000 rpm in a Beckman 60 Ti fixed angle rotor). Additional DNA was removed by polymin P precipitation (1% w/v final concentration). The fusion protein was purified using a GS-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity column and Sephacryl S-100 (Amersham Biosciences) column, and then the fusion protein was cleaved to remove the GST using 0.9 NIH units of thrombin/mg of protein in 150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4 (pH 7.3) for 15 h at room temperature. The cleavage reaction was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to a final concentration of 1 mm. The cleaved protein was purified away from the non-cleaved protein and free GST by passing the protein through a second GS-Sepharose affinity column and applying the flow-through fraction through a Sephacryl S-100 column to remove the residual thrombin. E. coli BL21 cells containing the mutant plasmid of interest were grown at 37 °C. Protein expression was initiated by infection of the cells with bacteriophage λ CE6 (20.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6011) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Cells were lysed in the same manner as the GST fusion proteins without including EDTA or the polymin P precipitation step. Protein was bound to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen) and eluted by stepwise addition of 50, 500, and 750 mm imidazole (pH 8). Plasmid pBR322 was purified from E. coli DH5α cells using a cesium chloride gradient (21.Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.38-1.46Google Scholar) and used for the relaxation activity assays. Fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides for the binding affinity assays and the iodinated oligonucleotide for the cleavage assay were purchased from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were labeled as described previously (22.Zhang H.L. Malpure S. Li Z. Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9039-9045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with [γ-32P]ATP purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, except that the radiolabeled DNA in the excised fragment was eluted with 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm NaOAc (pH 5.0 at 22 °C) using microfilterfuge tubes from Rainin Instrument Co., Inc. The oligonucleotides were purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction and subsequently precipitated with ethanol. The purified product was stored in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 0.1 mm EDTA. Relaxation mixtures for salt dependence studies contained 400 ng of supercoiled pBR322, 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 5 mmMgCl2, the amount of KCl indicated, and the indicated amount of protein in a total volume of 20 μl. Relaxation mixtures for the pH profiles contained 400 ng of supercoiled pBR322, 40 mm buffer (MES between pH 5.5 and 6.5, Tris-HCl between pH 7.0 and 8.5, and CHES between pH 9.0 and 10.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 20 ng of wild type, or 500 ng of mutant E. coli DNA topoisomerase I in a final volume of 20 μl. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, then stopped by the addition of 2% (w/v) SDS, and heat-inactivated at 65 °C for 15 min. The reaction products were separated on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel (1× TAE buffer), stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by ultraviolet illumination. Each 30-μl reaction mixture contained 1 μm 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotide of the sequence 5′-UAAAAAAA-3′ with an iodinated uracil, 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl and 500 ng/μl of protein. The assay was performed as described previously (23.Zhu C.X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16206-16210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine the rate of cleavage, time points were taken at 30 s; 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min; and 1 and 2 h. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on a 19:1 polyacrylamide gel containing 50% (w/v) urea in 1× Tris borate-EDTA buffer. Gels were visualized by autoradiography on a Packard InstantImager. Assays were done in triplicate. Reactions containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0 at 22 °C), 5 mmMgCl2, 5, 20, 40, 60, or 80 mm KCl, 2 nm 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide of the sequence 5′-CGC↓AAC↓TT-3′ (where ↓ indicates a site of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I cleavage (22.Zhang H.L. Malpure S. Li Z. Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9039-9045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) in a total volume of 500 μl were allowed to equilibrate with the indicated amount of protein for 3 min at room temperature. Fluorescence polarization (FP) measurements were taken on an ISS PC1 Spectrofluorometer at room temperature. All measurements were taken with an excitation wavelength of 494 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm in a 5 × 10-mm quartz cuvette. Samples were read until the standard deviation for each measurement was 10 mP units or below. Assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry, FP binding isotherms were fit to the logistical Equation 1,Y1−Y21+(x/x0)P+Y2Equation 1 using Origin software package (Microcal), where Y1 is the initial Y value;Y2 is the final Y value;x0 is the binding constant; and p is the power, which was set to 1. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to change His-365 to alanine, arginine, glutamine, asparagine, glutamate, and aspartate. Expression of these mutants in the full-length version of E. coli DNA topoisomerase I was not possible as a GST fusion. DNA sequencing data showed that the plasmid contained the correct sequence. However, induction resulted in a degraded form of the protein (data not shown). Instead, these mutants were made with the polyhistidine-tagged construct. All enzymes were purified to homogeneity (data not shown). The histidine-tagged and wild type proteins relax supercoiled DNA to the same extent, indicating that N-terminal histidines do not affect activity (data not shown). The wild type enzyme shows maximal relaxation at pH 8 and a broad, bell-shaped pH-dependent curve. Activity ceases to be detectable at pH 5.5 (Fig. 3) and above pH 10 (data not shown). Relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA requires magnesium (23.Zhu C.X. Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16206-16210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 24.Domanico P.L. Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1991; 42: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). As magnesium begins to precipitate out of solution at pH 10, it is impossible to determine accurately relaxation ability at or above pH 10. Although there is no detectable relaxation activity by the wild type protein at pH 10.5 and minimal relaxation ability at pH 10 (data not shown), it is unclear if this lack of activity is pH-dependent or due to loss of magnesium below the threshold needed for relaxation to occur. The pH dependence of E. coli topoisomerase I in relaxing negatively supercoiled DNA suggests that the enzyme undergoes general acid/base catalysis and that either a histidine or a cysteine could be involved. The active sites of E. coli topoisomerase I and topoisomerase III do not have a cysteine (3.Lima C.D. Wang J.C. Mondragón A. Nature. 1994; 367: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 13.Mondragón A. DiGate R. Struct. Fold. Des. 1999; 7: 1373-1383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar); the only conserved histidine is located at position 365. His-365 could participate in general acid/base catalysis as follows: 1) as the acid that donates a proton to the 3′-OH of the leaving DNA strand; 2) as the base that abstracts a proton from the active site tyrosine; or 3) by donating a proton to the putative general acid, Glu-9, via a charge-relay network. To test the ability of the residue to act as the general base, it was mutated to an alanine and an arginine. Polar and acidic substitutions were made to test the ability of the residue to act as a general acid. If His-365 acts as a general acid, then deprotonation of the imidazole ring will increase the activity of the wild type enzyme but a similar change in pH should not affect a mutant enzyme with a polar residue in that location. In addition, should the side-chain act as a general acid, then changing the histidine to an acidic residue will shift the maximal activity to a lower pH. All the mutants show a shift in maximal relaxation to above pH 8.5 with sharper, more attenuated bell-shaped curves (Fig. 3). Only minimal relaxation activity is exhibited by the mutants below pH 7. The polar and acidic substitutions shifted optimal DNA relaxation to the basic region slightly more than the alanine and arginine mutations with maximal relaxation at pH 9.0–9.5. No increased activity at lower pH was observed for any mutant. Attempts to regain wild type-like pH-dependent activity with H365A by adding exogenous imidazole were unsuccessful (data not shown). Addition of up to 1m imidizole results in a decrease in H365A enzymatic activity. In the presence of 100 mm imidazole, the H365A mutant has the same pH profile as in the absence of imidazole (data not shown). Originally, relaxation assays were performed with 120 mm KCl, but His-365 mutants do not fully relax supercoiled DNA at this salt concentration (Fig. 4). The assays show that increasing concentrations of salt inhibit relaxation by the wild type and mutant enzymes. The wild type enzyme can relax negatively supercoiled DNA in the presence of 0–140 mm KCl. The His-365 mutants have maximal enzymatic activity in the absence of salt, have minimal relaxation activity between 60 mm KCl and 120 mm KCl, and lose the ability to relax supercoiled DNA above 120 mm KCl. Wild type E. coli DNA topoisomerase I has full enzymatic activity over a greater range of salt concentrations than the His-365 mutants (Fig. 4). Successive 5-fold dilutions of wild type and His-365 mutant enzymes were performed to investigate the degree to which the wild type enzyme outperforms mutant enzymes as salt concentration increases. Serial dilutions show that the mutants are ∼125-fold less able to relax supercoiled DNA at 60 mm KCl, whereas in the absence of salt, the wild type is only ∼25-fold more active. In all cases, the His-365 mutants are less able than the wild type to relax negatively supercoiled DNA as salt concentration increases (Fig. 4). The ability of the H365A and H365Q mutants to cleave single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides was examined with an 8-base oligomer radioactively labeled at the 5′ end. Polydeoxyadenosine with an iodo-uracil as the first base (diUA7) has been shown previously (16.Roche C.J. Tse-Dinh Y. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 29: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) to have a relatively fast cleavage rate, whereas the iodo-uracil maintains cleavage at the same position in the oligonucleotide. Given that definitive studies of E. colitopoisomerase I (TopoI) cleavage have not been done with this assay to determine the kinetics of the reaction, an attempt was made to assess whether the reaction occurred under single turnover conditions, similar to a Scheme presented by Stivers et al. (25.Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochem. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for vaccinia topoisomerase I.konkCldiUA7·+TopoI⇌diUA7·/TopoI⇀diUA3·+A4+TopoIkoff In Scheme 1, cleavage is irreversible and occurs under conditions of enzyme excess over DNA. The length of DNA substrate used prevents re-ligation from occurring as the cleaved strand that is non-covalently bound to the enzyme would diffuse away (26.Tse-Dinh Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10931-10935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, in this scheme, the observed rate could in principle either reflect the DNA binding step or the cleavage step in the reaction. Observed rates that are independent of enzyme concentration or reach a maximal rate likely reflect first-order catalytic steps in the mechanism, whereas the binding step should be dependent on enzyme concentration. To maintain limiting amounts of oligonucleotide, DNA:protein ratios of 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 1:5, and 1:8 were examined at pH 8. DNA concentration was maintained at 1 μm, whereas enzyme concentration was increased to 1, 2, 3.6, 5.1, and 7.7 μm. Neither the wild type nor H365Q enzymes appear to have concentration dependence regarding the maximal extent of DNA cleavage, suggesting that the assay reports both DNA binding and cleavage inseparably. However, H365A is heavily concentration-dependent up to 500 ng/μl (5.1 μm) with the rate decreasing with increasing enzyme concentration (Fig. 5). This suggests that H365A may undergo a concentration-dependent inactivation that could be due, for example, to enzyme aggregation at high concentration. However, at 500 ng/μl (the enzyme concentration used to determine pH dependence) H365A has reached its maximal reaction rate. Nevertheless, the rate and extent of the reaction can be observed (Fig. 6). At any pH value, the overall extent of cleavage is greater by the alanine mutant than by the wild type or the glutamine mutant. The wild type and glutamine mutant do not cleave at pH 6, whereas the alanine mutant has minimal activity. After 2 h, it appears that both the wild type and glutamine mutant have reached their maximal extent of cleavage at pH 7 and 8. In contrast, H365A does not. Given the standard deviation between three experiments, it would appear that the wild type enzyme has a low extent of cleavage at pH 7–9 but reaches its maximal rate more rapidly than either of the mutants (Fig. 6). A better way to compare the cleavage activities is to examine the rate of the reaction. Assuming that the reaction is first-order and fitting the data to a single exponential (Equation2),%Cl=%Cl0·(1−e−k·t)Equation 2 where %Cl is the fraction cleaved, %Cl0 is the maximal fraction cleaved, k is the observed rate, and t is time, enzymatic rates can be compared at different pH values. It can be seen that the wild type is more active at pH 7 and 8, and it follows the same dependence as for relaxation. The cleavage activity of H365A and H365Q lacks pH dependence (Fig. 7).Figure 7Comparison of the single-stranded DNA oligonucleotide cleavage rate versus pH values by wild type (▪), H365A (▴), and H365Q (●) mutant E. coliDNA topoisomerase I. The rate of oligonucleotide cleavage by H365A and H365Q is not dependent upon pH in contrast to the wild type enzyme. The rate (fraction of oligonucleotide cleaved per min) is plotted as a function of pH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A mechanism of action has been proposed in which the closed enzyme must open to allow binding of single-stranded DNA to a groove leading to the active site. After binding, the enzyme can cleave the single-stranded DNA. As binding of single-stranded DNA must occur before cleavage, measuring the binding affinity of wild type and mutant enzymes allows for a clearer picture of the mechanism of action and the role of various active site residues in binding and cleavage. To determine whether the greater sensitivity to salt and loss of relaxation ability in the His-365 mutants was a result of a loss or gain of DNA binding ability, fluorescence polarization measurements were used to look at DNA binding affinity.

In mammals, deficiency of AS leads to citrullinemia, a debilitating and often fatal autosomal recessive urea cycle disorder, whereas its overexpression for sustained nitric oxide production via the arginine-citrulline cycle leads to the potentially fatal hypotension associated with septic and cytokine-induced circulatory shock. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli argininosuccinate synthetase (EAS) in complex with ATP and with ATP and citrulline have been determined at 2.0-Å resolution.

There are three important metabolic processes that require this catalysis. First, in all organisms AS catalyzes the penultimate step in the biosynthesis of arginine, one of the 20 amino acid building blocks of life, and a precursor for the synthesis of several other biomolecules. Second, AS participates in the urea cycle, a five-enzyme cycle that employs four of the enzymes of arginine biosynthesis to detoxify ammonia through the production of urea. Ammonia detoxification is critical for the survival of higher organisms. In humans, failure to produce functional AS leads to the buildup of citrulline, ammonia, and orotic acid. If untreated, the neurotoxic ammonia can cause brain damage and coma, and in cases where urea cycle function is significantly compromised (less than 5% activity) the condition is typically fatal (1.Beaudet A.L.

Finally, AS and a second urea cycle enzyme, argininosuccinate lyase, together with the flavoprotein nitric-oxide synthase form the arginine-citrulline cycle, an abbreviated urea cycle that provides de novo arginine biosynthesis for sustainable overproduction of nitric oxide (NO (2.Hattori Y.

AS is the rate-limiting enzyme in both the urea and the arginine-citrulline cycles (11.Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12.Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and is therefore a key participant in all these pathways. Previously, we reported the structures of uncomplexed EAS and EAS complexed with citrulline and aspartate (EAS·CIT+ASP) (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Each monomer of this tetrameric protein was found to consist of a nucleotide binding domain and a novel catalytic/multimerization domain. The EAS nucleotide binding domain was found to be structurally similar to the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases, GMP, NAD+, and asparagine synthetase (14.Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 15.Rizzi M. Nessi C. Mattevi A. Coda A. Bolognesi M. Galizzi A.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16146-16157Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), thus confirming that EAS is a member of this enzyme family. N-type ATP pyrophosphatases all catalyze a substrate adenylation to activate a carbonyl or carboxyl group for the subsequent nucleophilic attack of a nitrogen nucleophile (14.Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Although our initial structures enabled us to determine the citrulline and aspartate binding sites crystallographically and could be used to model the ATP, the relative positions of the three substrates were such that we predicted that the protein must undergo a large conformational change during its catalytic cycle. To confirm this hypothesis, we have determined the structures of EAS in complex with intact ATP (EAS·ATP), and in complex with ATP and citrulline (EAS·ATP+CIT). The structures presented here confirm the residues involved in citrulline binding and reveal that ATP can bind to the enzyme in two distinct conformations, both of which are believed to be catalytically relevant. Comparisons of all available EAS structures provide structural evidence that the binding of ATP results in a large rigid body conformational change of the nucleotide binding domain. Furthermore, these comparisons have yielded structural explanations for some of the observed kinetic properties of the enzyme, including the order of substrate binding and the increased formation of the adenylated citrulline intermediate in the presence of aspartate. Together, these structures have provided valuable information about the first steps of AS catalysis and have enabled us to propose a detailed enzymatic mechanism. The expression and purification of EAS was as described previously (17.Lemke C. Yeung M. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 2028-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The expressed protein consists of full-length EAS and an additional C-terminal 6-histidine affinity tag connected by a three-amino acid linker. Crystallization of the EAS·ATP complex was carried out using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion technique at room temperature (293 K). Equal volumes (3–5 μl) of protein solution (10 mg ml−1EAS, 25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2, 150 mm guanidine hydrochloride) and microseed solution (2.0 mNa+/K+ phosphate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 10−6 diluted microseed EAS crystals prepared using the Hampton Seed Bead kit) were mixed on a siliconized glass coverslip and suspended over a 1-ml reservoir of precipitating solution (1.6m Na+/K+ phosphate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5). The EAS·ATP+CIT complex was crystallized in the same manner with the addition of 2 mm citrulline to the protein solution. In each case, crystals appeared within 2–4 days and grew as large chunks, similar to those described in Lemke et al. (17.Lemke C. Yeung M. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 2028-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Before data collection, the EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT crystals were soaked for 10 min in cryoprotectant solution (350 mg ml−1 trehalose, 1.6 mNa+/K+ phosphate, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5, 150 mm guanidine hydrochloride, 5 mm ATP, 15 mm MgCl2) and in cryoprotectant solution supplemented with 2 mm citrulline, respectively. The crystals were then transferred to rayon CryoLoops (Hampton Research) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen crystals were subsequently mounted in a continuous cold stream, and data were collected at 100 K on a MAR345 image plate using Cu-Kα radiation. The data were indexed, merged, and scaled using DENZO/SCALEPACK (18.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. 276. Academic Press, Inc., New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Because the EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT crystals are isomorphous with the uncomplexed EAS crystals, the uncomplexed structure was used as the starting model for the refinement of both complexed structures. The models were refined using the simulated annealing, individual B-factor refinement, and energy minimization protocols incorporated into the program CNS (19.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Each round of refinement was alternated with a round of manual rebuilding using TURBO-FRODO (22.Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Partners Geometry. Silicon Graphics Corp., Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). The progress of the refinement was monitored by decreases in Rcrystand Rfree. The final EAS·ATP model consists of residues 1–182, 187–385, and 394–443, 286 water molecules, 1 ATP molecule, 3 phosphate ions, and 1 guanidine ion. Only water molecules with reasonable hydrogen-bonding geometry and significant density at greater than 3ς on ςA-weighted ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ maps were included. There was insufficient electron density present to model residues 183–186, 386–393, and the 12 C-terminal residues (Lys-444, Gly-445, and Gln-446, along with the appended tripeptide linker and the 6-histidine tag) as well as the full side chains of 7 residues (Lys-4, Asp-22, Tyr-182, Glu-187, Lys-230, Glu-317, and Ser-430). The final EAS·ATP+CIT model consists of residues 1–385, 393–446, 186 water molecules, 1 ATP molecule, 2 citrulline molecules, 1 phosphate ion, and two guanidine ions. There was insufficient electron density to model residues 386–392 and the 9 C-terminal residues (the tripeptide linker and the 6-histidine tag) as well as the full side chains of 6 residues (Lys-5, Lys-74, Lys-183, Glu-187, Lys-230, and Lys-444). A summary of the refinement statistics for both structures is presented in Table II. The quality of the final structures was assessed using the program PROCHECK (23.Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). For the EAS·ATP structure, 90.0% of the residues were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 8.9% in allowed regions, 1.1% in generously allowed regions, and none in disallowed regions. For the EAS·ATP+CIT structure, 89.7% of the residues were found in the most favored regions of the Ramachandran plot, 8.7% in allowed regions, 1.6% in generously allowed regions, and none in disallowed regions. The overall G factor was 0.3 for both the EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT structures, indicating excellent geometry and stereochemistry.Table IIRefinement statisticsEAS·ATPEAS·ATP + CITResolution limits45–2.041–2.0Number of reflections used in refinement3403132696Number of reflections used to compute Rfree33603272Rcryst2-aRcryst = Σ(‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖)/Σ‖Fc‖, where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure amplitudes of a reflection, respectively.(Rfree2-bRfree was calculated by randomly omitting 10% of the observed reflections from the refinement.)

For comparison of conformational changes in the overall structure (see Figs. 4 and 5) the main-chain atoms of tetrameric EAS structures were used for the alignment. The EAS tetramer was generated by applying the symmetry operators of the I222 space group. For comparison of the substrate binding sites (see Fig. 7), the main-chain atoms of monomeric EAS structures were aligned.Figure 5Root mean square deviation (RMSD) between residues 1–180 of the uncomplexed and ATP complexed EAS structures.

Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Modification of the crystallization conditions used for these structures has yielded isomorphous crystals that are capable of tolerating the addition of ATP, thereby enabling the structure determination of the EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT complexes (see “Experimental Procedures” and Table I). The key advance that permitted the co-crystallization and soaking of EAS crystals with ATP was the addition of guanidine to the crystallization conditions. In the resulting structures guanidine localizes to a region of intermolecular crystal contacts that we believe would otherwise be compromised by the substrate-induced conformational change. The EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT structures were refined to an Rcryst = 17.7% and Rfree= 21.6% and an Rcryst = 19.2% and Rfree = 22.9%, respectively (Table II).Table ISummary of data collection statisticsEAS·ATPEAS·ATP + CITWavelength (Å)1.541.54Resolution range (Å)45–2.0041–1.99Space groupI222I222 a (Å)78.0676.48 b (Å)104.05104.22 c (Å)128.57128.84Total data200378229900Unique data3503634170Redundancy5.76.7Completeness (%)98.0 (86.6)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.95.6 (71.9)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.F2 > 3ς(F2)79.0 (38.0)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.73.9 (25.9)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.Rmerge(%)1-bRmerge = ΣΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/Σ Ii, where 〈I〉 is the average intensity of equivalent reflections, and the sum is extended over all measured observations for all unique reflections.6.4 (33.6)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.8.2 (39.6)1-aValues in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.Average I/ς(I)15.611.81-a Values in parentheses refer to reflections in the outer resolution shell, 2.07–2.0 Å and 2.06–1.99 Å, respectively.1-b Rmerge = ΣΣi‖Ii − 〈I〉‖/Σ Ii, where 〈I〉 is the average intensity of equivalent reflections, and the sum is extended over all measured observations for all unique reflections. Open table in a new tab In all four EAS structures reported to date, a single monomer of EAS is present in the asymmetric unit. Each monomer consists of two α/β domains, a nucleotide binding domain similar to that of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatase class of enzymes and a novel catalytic/multimerization domain. Two EAS monomers come together to form a dimer, which in turn dimerizes to form the biologically relevant homotetramer (17.Lemke C. Yeung M. Howell P.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structure of EAS complexed with ATP has been determined at 2.0-Å resolution. As predicted previously (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the nucleotide substrate is bound to EAS in a manner similar to that observed in the GMP, NAD+, and asparagine synthetase structures (14.Tesmer J.J. Klem T.J. Deras M.L. Davisson V.J. Smith J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 74-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16.Larsen T.M. Boehlein S.K. Schuster S.M. Richards N.G. Thoden J.B.

Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 1129-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The ATP molecule (ATP1) is bound at the topological switch point between the second and fifth β-strands (β2 and β7) of the nucleotide binding domain and interacts directly with residues Ala-16, Ala-42, Gly-128, Thr-130, Asp-135, and Asp-193 of the nucleotide binding domain, 7 water molecules, and an inorganic phosphate molecule scavenged from the crystallization conditions (Fig. 2,a and b). Eight hydrogen bonds secure the adenosine moiety, five to main chain atoms, two to ordered waters, and one to the phosphate bound to the PP loop. The PP loop is the loop between the second β-strand and the first α-helix of the nucleotide binding domain, where free pyrophosphate has been shown to bind in other N-type pyrophosphatases. The absolutely conserved AS residues Arg-106 and Phe-139 are in the vicinity of the adenine ring but are not sufficiently close to contribute to stacking interactions. The triphosphate tail of ATP1 is secured by an additional 11 electrostatic interactions, 1 to the amino nitrogen of Thr-130, 1 to a carboxyl oxygen of Asp-135, 2 to a carboxyl oxygen of Asp-193, 6 to ordered waters, and 1 to the phosphate bound to the PP loop. In this conformation, the β- and γ-phosphates of ATP1 extend away from the PP loop to interact with two residues of the aspartate binding site, Thr-130 and Asp-135. Although all three phosphates of ATP are relatively well ordered in this conformation and an excess of Mg2+ was included in the crystallization conditions, no electron density consistent with the ion was observed. The structure of EAS complexed with both ATP and citrulline has also been determined at 2.0-Å resolution. Two molecules of citrulline and one molecule of ATP were observed in the resulting electron density. The first molecule of citrulline (CIT1) is bound at the citrulline binding site as described in the EAS·CIT+ASP structure (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), with few deviations (Fig. 3, a and b). In the current configuration, the hydroxyl oxygen of Ser-191 no longer makes a hydrogen bond to the terminal ureido nitrogen of CIT1, whereas the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr-291 and a carboxyl oxygen of Glu-202 now make hydrogen bonds to the amino nitrogen and Nε of CIT1, respectively. These conformational changes are small, and it is uncertain that they represent significant differences between the EAS·CIT+ASP and EAS·ATP+CIT structures. The second molecule of citrulline (CIT2) is bound adjacent to CIT1 and interacts directly with residues Thr-130, Asn-134, Asp-135, Glu-202, Ser-287 as well as CIT 1 and the bound ATP (Fig. 3, c and d). In the presence of equimolar citrulline and aspartate, this site is occupied by aspartate (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This suggests that the CIT2 binding site is the result of the high concentration of citrulline and the absence of aspartate in the crystallization conditions and, therefore, does not represent a biologically relevant citrulline binding site. In the reciprocal experiment, where EAS is provided with excess aspartate but no citrulline, aspartate is observed in both the aspartate and citrulline (CIT1) binding sites (data not shown). In the EAS·ATP+CIT structure the ATP molecule (ATP2) is bound in a similar manner as ATP1 in the EAS·ATP structure, with the exception that its β- and γ-phosphates no longer interact with residues of the aspartate binding site but instead pass over the ribose C3 to interact with residues of the PP loop (Fig. 2, c and d). Four residues of the PP-loop (Ser-18, Leu-21, Asp-22, and Thr-23) and a water molecule contribute eight hydrogen bonds to coordinate the γ-phosphate of ATP2, whereas the β-phosphate is held in position by only one hydrogen bond to the carboxyl oxygen of Gly-128. This disparity of binding interactions with the two phosphates results in a much higher mobility for the β-phosphate, which is consequently poorly defined in the experimental electron density (Fig. 2c). As with the EAS·ATP structure, although an excess of Mg2+ was included in the crystallization conditions, no corresponding electron density consistent with the ion was observed. Several interrelated conformational changes have been identified between the main-chain atoms of the native and substrate bound models of EAS (Fig. 4). The principal conformational change is brought about by ATP binding. In both ATP complexed structures, nucleotide binding causes the amino nitrogen of Gly-128 to move 2 Å to hydrogen bond with the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl oxygens of ATP, whereas the carbonyl oxygen of Ala-16 moves 1.5 Å to hydrogen bond with the 3′ hydroxyl oxygen. To allow these residues to interact with ATP, significant changes occur in the C-terminal portions of strands β2, β7, and β8. Strands β2 and β7 move closer together, resulting in a new β-sheet hydrogen bond between the nitrogen of Ala-16 (β2) and the oxygen of Gly-126 (β7) and the loss of a β-sheet hydrogen bond between the nitrogen Asp-127 (β7) and the carboxyl oxygen of Tyr-153 (β8) (Fig. 4c). This conformational change is propagated throughout the domain in two ways. First, the reorganization of the central β-sheet causes a major shift of the residues following β8 through to the end of the domain (residues 154–188; Figs. 4b and5). Secondly, this shift of residues 154–188 is augmented by a concerted rigid body movement of the majority of the nucleotide binding domain with respect to the body of the synthetase domain (Fig. 4a). This movement approximates a rotation of the entire nucleotide binding domain (residues 1–72, 101–188), with the exception of helices α4 and α5 (residues 101–120 and 135–146, respectively), which are closely associated with the synthetase domain and remain relatively unmoved. The direction of these conformational changes is consistent with a movement of the nucleotide binding domain toward the synthetase domain, which forms the core of the tetrameric enzyme. The active site, located at the interface of the two domains, becomes significantly narrowed as a result of this movement. Although these conformational changes are evident in both structures presented in this paper, differences between the two suggest that the conformational changes in the EAS·ATP+CIT complex have progressed further than in the EAS·ATP complex (Fig. 5). The most striking difference is the degree to which the nucleotide binding domain has rotated with respect to the synthetase domain. In the EAS·ATP structure the rotation measures ∼3°, whereas in EAS·ATP+CIT structure the rotation is almost 5°. This difference is corroborated by structural alignments of both nucleotide-bound models with the uncomplexed structure. Although the residues that form the body of the synthetase domain (residues 73–100, 189–375) have a relatively low main-chain root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.3Å for both structures, the main-chain r.m.s.d. of the nucleotide binding domains (residues 1–72, 149–189) of EAS·ATP and EAS·ATP+CIT are 1.2Å and 1.8Å, respectively. There are two other significant differences between the two nucleotide-bound structures. The first is a deviation at the C-terminal end of helix α4. In the EAS·ATP+CIT structure, a rearrangement of the hydrophobic interface between α4 and β7 distorts the final two turns of α4, resulting in a greater deviation of this region than observed in other EAS structures. The second is a unique variation in the Type I β-turn between β13 and β14 (residues Arg-281–Glu-284; Fig. 4d). In the EAS·ATP+CIT structure, a near 180° rotation in ψ of the i+2 residue (Ile-283) results in the loss of the i to i+3 β-turn hydrogen bond and the addition of a new hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of Ile-283 and the amide nitrogen of Ala-285. This distortion is compensated for by main chain conformational changes in Glu-284 through Lys-286 that allow regular β-sheet hydrogen bonding to resume at Ala-285. This conformational change may be caused by the binding of CIT2. However, although CIT2 interacts with the side chains of Arg-281 and Ser-287, the main chain deformation of these residues is slight. The only residue of this β-hairpin whose main chain and side-chain positions are significantly altered in the conformational change is that of Glu-284. In the EAS·ATP structure, the carboxyl group of Glu-284 makes two electrostatic interactions with Arg-407 and Arg-334, whereas in the EAS·ATP+CIT structure, the carboxyl group of Glu-284 is displaced over 7.5 Å to interact with the backbone amide nitrogens of Asn-408 and Leu-409. Interestingly all four of these pairings represent intermolecular interactions between the homodimers that make up the EAS tetramer. Furthermore, since Arg-334 is in a different monomer than Arg-407, Asn-408, and Leu-409, it is possible for each Glu-284 residue in one homodimer to make intermolecular contacts with both monomers of the second homodimer. Finally, Arg-334 localizes to the loop between helices α10 and α11, whereas Arg-407, Asn-408, and Leu-409 localize to the first turn of helix α13. Because these regions interact with the nucleotide binding domain, this network of interactions may be a mechanism for the intermolecular coordination of catalysis. Previous work has determined that the enzymatic mechanism of AS begins with the ordered binding of ATP, citrulline and aspartate (30.Raushel F.M. Seiglie J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Once the first two substrates have bound to the protein, the nucleophilic attack by the ureido oxygen of citrulline on the α-phosphate of ATP can occur, resulting in an activated citrulline-adenylate intermediate (Fig. 1) (31.Rochovansky O. Ratner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 2254-2260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although formation of this intermediate does not require aspartate, the rate of intermediate formation has been shown to be enhanced in its presence (32.Ghose C. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 5894-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Together, the structures presented previously (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L.

The citrulline binding site is a deep pocket at the interface of the nucleotide binding and synthetase domains into which citrulline binds in an extended conformation with its ureido group exposed at the opening (Fig. 6). The aspartate binding site is located at the rim of this pocket such that when bound, aspartate would sterically restrict access to the citrulline binding site, thus necessitating an ordered binding of the two substrates. Similarly, the binding site of aspartate also influences ATP binding. As demonstrated by the EAS·ATP model, in the absence of competition, the γ-phosphate of ATP binds to residues of the aspartate binding site. Assuming that these interactions are required for the efficient recruitment of ATP and that aspartate binding, like the CIT2 molecule, would disrupt these interactions, it is clear that the enzyme must bind ATP before aspartate. The conformation of the triphosphate group of ATP also affects the ability of the enzyme to form the adenylated citrulline intermediate. It is most likely that substrate adenylation occurs by an SN2 displacement mechanism, in which the nucleophilic attack of the citrulline ureido oxygen on one side of the α-phosphate of ATP results in the concomitant release of pyrophosphate from the other. With the γ-phosphate of ATP bound at the aspartate binding site, the β-phosphate is situated between the α-phosphate of ATP and the ureido oxygen of citrulline, preventing formation of the intermediate (Fig. 7). Upon aspartate binding, however, the γ-phosphate is displaced to interact with residues of the PP-loop. In this second conformation the α-phosphate is exposed for nucleophilic attack by the ureido oxygen of citrulline, making it possible for catalysis to proceed. Thus the observed increase in the rate of adenylated citrulline formation in the presence of aspartate is explained. In current structures of EAS, the intermediate formation is not possible due to the large distance between the citrulline and ATP. Originally, when ATP was modeled into the uncomplexed EAS structure, the α-phosphate of ATP and the ureido oxygen of citrulline were estimated to be ∼7.9 Å apart (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The conformational changes observed in the structures presented in this paper have reduced this separation to 5.8 Å, which although considerably closer, is still too large a distance for catalysis to proceed. Although some of this distance could be spanned by a conformational change in citrulline, in the structures determined to date maximum extension of the molecule cannot bring the ureido oxygen of citrulline into van der Waals contact with the α-phosphate of ATP. Therefore we believe that the conformational changes observed within the nucleotide binding domain represent only the beginning of the movement that this domain undergoes to effect catalysis. We estimate that an additional 3–5° rotation of the nucleotide binding domain (without further conformational changes occurring) would bring the ATP sufficiently close to the ureido oxygen of citrulline for the adenylation reaction to proceed. Unfortunately, this additional conformational change is prevented from occurring in the I222 crystal form by intermolecular crystal contacts. Although properly aligned for substrate adenylation, the conformation of the ATP2 in the EAS·ATP+CIT structure is different from the conformation of the ATP observed in the NAD+ synthetase ATP complex, the only other available N-type ATP pyrophosphatase structure available with ATP. ATP2 adopts a U-shaped conformation such that the α, β, and γ phosphates are linearly arranged (Fig. 8b), whereas the ATP complexed with NAD+ synthetase is S-shaped (Fig. 8c), with the triphosphate tail bent such that the pyrophosphate moiety can interact with the PP-loop. Interestingly, six of the eight interactions of the γ-phosphate of ATP2 with the PP-loop are analogous to those made by the β-phosphate of ATP in the NAD+ synthetase complex. Although the conformation of ATP2 is at odds with the ATP observed in complex with NAD+ synthetase, it is remarkably similar to the ATP molecules observed in the structures of several type II tRNA synthetases (33.Cavarelli J.

Type II tRNA synthetases catalyze similar substrate adenylation reactions but do not have a PP-loop homologous to that of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatases. Catalysis could therefore proceed with ATP in either of these conformations. In similar adenylation reactions it has been suggested that a general mechanism for substrate adenylation may involve conserved arginine or lysine residues and two or three divalent cations that stabilize the pyrophosphate leaving group and the pentavalent transition-state intermediate formed during adenylation (38.Belrhali H.

Although we have been unable to locate magnesium ions in the current EAS structures, such stabilizing ions have been identified in the other N-type ATP pyrophosphatases and are reported to be required for maximal AS activity (30.Raushel F.M. Seiglie J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). On the other hand, although the participation of a positively charged side chain has not yet been reported for other members of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatase family, in the EAS·ATP structure the 100% conserved residue, Arg-106, is in the vicinity of the α-phosphate of ATP and may be positioned for such a stabilization role. The second nucleophilic attack, that of aspartate on the adenylated citrulline intermediate, appears to be relatively straightforward. Because of the proximity of the aspartate to the synthetase domain, the proposed conformational change of the nucleotide binding domain is not expected to significantly affect its position. Once the adenylated citrulline is formed the aspartate amino group appears to be well positioned for immediate attack on the activated ureido carbon of the intermediate, thereby leading to the production of AS, AMP, and PPi. As suggested previously (13.Lemke C.T. Howell P.L. Structure (Lond.). 2001; 9: 1153-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the salt bridge between the carboxyl group of Asp-135 and the amino nitrogen of aspartate may serve to deprotonate the amino nitrogen before its nucleophilic attack on the ureido carbon of adenylated citrulline or to stabilize the positive charge accumulated on the nitrogen during the formation of argininosuccinate. In addition to this, modeling studies have shown that the extension of citrulline toward the α-phosphate of ATP can position both ureido nitrogens of citrulline within hydrogen-bonding distance of the carboxyl group of Asp-135. In this conformation, Asp-135 would serve to enhance the negative charge of the amino nitrogen nucleophile as well as the positive charge on its activated carbon target. After catalysis is completed, the reported release of products from the enzyme is AS, PPi, then AMP (30.Raushel F.M. Seiglie J.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 979-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Given that the aspartate and citrulline binding sites are significantly less accessible than the ATP binding site and that AMP is only bound to the enzyme by a small number of interactions, it is peculiar that AS should be released from the enzyme first. Perhaps this discrepancy will be clarified with the structure of the fully closed EAS in complex with the adenylated citrulline intermediate or the reaction products.

https://openalex.org/W2057991943,"Using ψ-BLAST, we have developed a method for identifying the poorly conserved δ subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme from all sequenced bacteria. This approach, starting with Escherichia coli δ, leads not only to the identification of δ but also to the DnaX and δ′ subunits of the DnaX complex and other AAA+-class ATPases. This suggests that, although not an ATPase, δ is related structurally to the other subunits of the DnaX complex that loads the β sliding clamp processivity factor onto DNA. To test this prediction, we aligned δ sequences with those of δ′ and, using the start of δ′ Domain III established from its x-ray crystal structure, predicted the juncture between Domains II and III of δ. This putative δ Domain III could be expressed to high levels, consistent with the prediction that it folds independently. δ Domain III, like Domain III of DnaX and δ′, assembles by itself into a complex with the other DnaX complex components. Cross-linking studies indicated a contact of δ with the DnaX subunits. These observations are consistent with a model where two τ subunits and one each of the γ, δ′, and δ subunits mutually interact to form a pentameric functional core for the DnaX complex."
