https://openalex.org/W2001019297,"A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae capable of simultaneous hydrolysis and fermentation of highly polymerized starch oligosaccharides was constructed. The Aspergillus awamori glucoamylase enzyme, form GAI, was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by means of the promoter and termination regions from a yeast enolase gene. Yeast transformed with plasmids containing an intron-free recombinant glucoamylase gene efficiently secreted glucoamylase into the medium, permitting growth of the transformants on starch as the sole carbon source. The natural leader sequence of the precursor of glucoamylase (preglucoamylase) was processed correctly by yeast, and the secreted enzyme was glycosylated through both N- and O-linkages at levels comparable to the native Aspergillus enzyme. The data provide evidence for the utility of yeast as an organism for the production, glycosylation, and secretion of heterologous proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2018186698,"Comparisons of the horns of males and females across genera of African antelopes indicate that male horns are better adapted for clashing or pushing against another pair of horns during intrasexual combat. The horns of females are relatively more specialized as stabbing weapons. Horns in females are found in only half the genera and in those genera where females have horns, the genera are heavier than genera with hornless females."

Latest Cretaceous plant fossils in the Arctic predate mid-latitude occurrences by as much as 18 million years, while typical Eocene vertebrate fossils appear some 2 to 4 million years early."
https://openalex.org/W1992568444,"Siphonodictidine is the major secondary metabolite of an undescribed Indo-Pacific sponge Siphonodictyon sp. that burrows into living coral heads. The structure of siphonodictidine was determined from spectral data. Laboratory bioassays suggest that siphonodictidine and, by analogy, the siphonodictyals from S. coralliphagum are responsible for maintaining zones of dead coral polyps around the oscular chimneys of these sponges."
https://openalex.org/W2065290282,"Bacteria that are able to use methane as a sole carbon and energy source also carry out a broad range of biotransformations, some of which have industrial and environmental significance. Genetic studies on methylotrophs, including the use of recombinant DNA techniques, show promise for the isolation and cloning of genes coding for specific functions."
https://openalex.org/W2065253200,Cadmium-113 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been used in studies of the structure and dynamics of inorganic and bioinorganic molecules. Chemical dynamics play an important role in the analysis of relaxation and chemical shift data. Naïve interpretations of relaxation data can be checked by performing these experiments at a variety of temperatures and magnetic field strengths. A combination of solid- and liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance measurements can provide the user with unambiguous data on chemical shielding. These data can be used to characterize zinc and calcium ion binding sites in metalloproteins.

In August the near-surface flow at 0 degrees , 110 degrees W reversed direction to eastward. By October the sea surface temperature in the equatorial zone increased by 5 degrees Celsius above the long-term monthly mean value, sea level rose by 22 centimeters at the Galápagos Islands, and the thermocline was displaced downward by 50 to 70 meters along the equator and the South American coast."

https://openalex.org/W2039792271,Allometric analysis of skull proportions in 25 species of fossil equids indicates that both scaling effects (allometry) and reorganization were factors in the evolutionary transformation of horse skulls. A relatively longer preorbital portion of the skull resulted from the ventral and forward displacement of the tooth row relative to the jaw joint and the orbit when high-crowned teeth evolved. Correlated with the increased distance between jaw joint and tooth row is an increase in the relative size of the attachment areas of masseter and internal pterygoid muscles.

https://openalex.org/W2116462917,"High-resolution microwave observations are providing new insights into the nature of active regions and eruptions on the sun and nearby stars. The strength, evolution, and structure of magnetic fields in coronal loops can be determined by multiple-wavelength observations with the Very Large Array. Flare models can be tested with Very Large Array snapshot maps, which have angular resolutions of better than 1 second of arc in time periods as short as 10 seconds. Magnetic changes that precede solar eruptions on time scales of tens of minutes involve primarily emerging coronal loops and the interactions of two or more loops. Magnetic reconnection at the interface of two closed loops may accelerate electrons and trigger the release of microwave energy in the coronal parts of the magnetic loops. Nearby main-sequence stars of late spectral type emit slowly varying microwave radiation and stellar microwave bursts that show striking similarities to those of the sun."
