https://openalex.org/W1525820657,"Abstract Uptake of labeled d- and l-glucose has been shown to occur with highly purified brush border membranes from the epithelial cells of rat small intestine using a Millipore filtration technique. An intact glucose carrier system in the isolated membranes was demonstrated as evidenced by the following. (a) d-Glucose was taken up and released faster than l-glucose. (b) Sodium ions increased initial rate and extent of d-glucose uptake 3- to 5-fold; no other cation showed this effect. (c) d-Glucose uptake and release was inhibited by phlorizin. (d) Countertransport of d-glucose was demonstrated. (e) d- and l-glucose reached the same level of uptake after prolonged incubation. (f) Uptake of labeled d-glucose was inhibited by higher concentrations of unlabeled d-galactose and vice versa. Glucose uptake by membrane vesicles represented entry into an intravesicular aqueous space rather than binding to the membrane. Exposure of the membrane to increasing cellobiose concentrations led to osmotic shrinkage of the intravesicular space and decreased glucose uptake. Infinite medium osmolarity and therefore zero intravesicular space resulted in no glucose uptake. Sodium in the medium (but not in the intravesicular spaces) stimulated d-glucose transport. It is concluded that isolated brush border membranes of intestinal epithelial cells retain the glucose carrier system. The reported findings are consistent with the concept that (a) glucose transport across the brush border membrane represents facilitated diffusion; (b) the glucose carrier is dependent on sodium ions; and (c) high extracellular, but not intracellular sodium concentrations lead to increased glucose transport."
https://openalex.org/W1896307687,"Partially purified acetyl-CoA carboxylase (EC 6.4.1.2) was activated several-fold by incubation with magnesium ions. The activation was inhibited by fluoride. Partially purified but not highly purified enzyme was inactivated by ATP in a reaction which was both time- and temperature-dependent. Inactivation by ATP was greatly enhanced by a protein fraction devoid of carboxylase activity, and the inactivation was independent of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate. Whereas inactivation of the enzyme in the presence of [γ-32P] ATP resulted in significant amounts of protein-bound 32P, incubation with [U-14C]ATP led to little incorporation of isotope into protein. The 32P label accompanied the carboxylase activity through ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. The 32P-labeled carboxylase was precipitated by the antibody to homogeneous acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The evidence is consistent with a mechanism for controlling acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity by an interconversion involving phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. It appears that the carboxylase protein is phosphorylated, and the activity decreased, by an ATP-dependent kinase. It is reactivated by dephosphorylation that is mediated by a magnesium-dependent phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W1572100925,"Rat kidney contains two distinct glutaminase isoenzymes. One requires phosphate for activity; the other is phosphate-independent but is activated 15-fold by maleate. By taking advantage of differences in activators and pH optima, specific assays were devised for each isoenzyme. Their distribution was then examined in individual structures of nephrons dissected from lyophilized 20-µ sections of kidney. Enzymatic cycling, oil well, and fluorometric techniques were combined to provide sufficient sensitivity to measure the enzymes in the 5- to 50-ng samples. The distribution of the two isoenzymes is complementary. Ratios of the two activities in the different structures vary from 0.05 to 50. Phosphate-independent glutaminase activity is high only in proximal straight tubules. All other structures assayed had less than one-tenth as much activity. Phosphate-dependent glutaminase activity is high in distal straight and convoluted tubules, intermediate in proximal convoluted tubules, and low in proximal straight tubules and glomeruli. Only the phosphate-dependent glutaminase activity responds to metabolic acidosis or alkalosis and this response appears to be limited to the proximal convoluted tubules. After administration of NH4Cl for 7 days to induce acidosis the activity increased 20-fold in these tubules, whereas 7 days of NaHCO3 administration to induce alkalosis caused a 40% decrease. Neither acidosis nor alkalosis affected phosphate-independent activity in any renal structure."
https://openalex.org/W1525562492,"The time course of changes in a variety of physiological parameters concerned with carbohydrate and lipid metabolism has been studied both in vivo and in the isolated perfused liver during induction and reversal of starvation ketosis in the rat. The data obtained demonstrate that surprisingly brief periods of starvation and refeeding exert dramatic effects on glucose and fatty acid metabolism in the intact animal and that generally synchronous changes occur in the ketogenic and gluconeogenic capacities of the perfused liver. In agreement with previous findings it was shown that the enhanced conversion of labeled oleate into ketone bodies by livers from fasted rats was associated with a concomitant depression in its incorporation into triglycerides, and that the antiketogenic effect of lactate was accompanied by a diversion of the fatty acid from the β oxidation sequence into the esterification pathway. The key observation, however, was that blockade of long chain fatty acid oxidation by (+)-decanoylcarnitine, an inhibitor of long chain acylcarnitinetransferase, stopped ketone body formation and acutely changed the pattern of metabolism of oleic acid in livers from fasted rats to that exhibited by livers from normal animals, i.e. the fatty acid was now virtually completely esterified. The data are consistent with the view that hepatic fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis are under strict dietary and hormonal control exerted primarily by regulation of an early step in the oxidative sequence, probably the acylcarnitinetransferase reaction. The possibility is also raised that the effects of lactate and other antiketogenic agents are related to interactions at this site."

https://openalex.org/W1522538207,"Abstract The effect of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides on the activation of adenylate cyclase by thyrotropin and prostaglandin E1 in beef thyroid plasma membranes was investigated. At 1 mm ATP concentration, GTP increases basal and thyrotropin-stimulated activity 2- to 4-fold at concentrations of 1 to 30 µm. Significant stimulation occurs at 0.1 µm. Greater maximal stimulation occurs with ITP (5- to 7-fold) over the concentration range of 20 to 50 µm. In order of decreasing maximal effect the nucleoside triphosphates are ITP g dGTP g GTP g XTP. At low concentrations GTP g ITP. Pyrimidine nucleotides had low activity. The enhancement occurs also with IDP and GDP and at 1 mm with 5'-IMP and 5'-GMP. The ITP and IDP effects have a 1 to 2 min lag period before they become manifest. F--activated cyclase is not stimulated and is partially inhibited at high nucleotide concentrations; thus, thyrotropin-stimulated cyclase may exceed F--stimulated activity in some conditions. Prostaglandin E1-stimulated activity is also enhanced by these nucleotides but, in contrast to thyrotropin activity, maximal stimulation by GTP = dGTP = ITP g XTP. Potassium ion increases thyrotropin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in the presence of 20 µm ITP, whereas there is no K+ effect on stimulation evoked by prostaglandin E1 even in the presence of ITP. Furthermore, the prostaglandin and thyrotropin stimulations are additive in the absence and in the presence of ITP and GTP. It is concluded that the nucleotides interact with the cyclase system not at the catalytic site, that the nucleotides can interact at more than one site, and that the thyrotropin and prostaglandin receptors are probably separate."
https://openalex.org/W1603139379,"Abstract Spark emission and atomic absorption spectroscopy of crystalline leucine aminopeptidase (bovine lens) (EC 3.4.1.1) shows the presence of 2 zinc atoms per subunit molecular weight of 54,000 (12 zinc atoms per oligomer of 320,000). Removal of zinc by dialysis yields a zinc-free product with no enzymatic activity which upon readdition of Zn2+, regains full activity with the concomitant binding of 2 zinc atoms per subunit. Addition of Cu2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ to the zinc-free enzyme does not result in stoichiometric binding of these ions or in significant regain in activity. Incubation of the enzyme containing 2 zinc atoms with various concentrations of Zn2+ and Mg2+ or Zn2+ and Mn2+ shows (a) that there is a competition between the ions for one binding site, (b) that the ratio of dissociation constants for this site is Kmg:Kzn = 150 at pH 9.5 and Kmn:Kzn = 35 at pH 8.5, and (c) that a maximum of 1 mole of Mg2+ or Mn2+ is bound per 54,000 g of leucine aminopeptidase. The results suggest that leucine aminopeptidase has two metal binding sites: a specificity site that must be occupied by zinc in order to have an active enzyme and an activation site which can be occupied by Zn2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ to give zinc-zinc, zinc-magnesium, or zinc-manganese enzymes with different specific activities. The nature of the ion occupying the activation site has a pronounced effect on the maximum velocity of the reaction and a minor effect on the Michaelis constant. A new amino acid analysis of the lens leucine aminopeptidase is presented which accounts for all of the total nitrogen and dry weight of the enzyme in terms of amino acid residues and which indicates that the enzyme contains eight half-cystines per 54,000-dalton subunit. Six of these are in the sulfhydryl form, but only one of these is available for reaction in the native enzyme. This reactive sulfhydryl is not needed for enzymatic activity. On a dry weight basis the absorbance of a 1% solution of leucine aminopeptidase at neutral pH in a 1-cm cuvette at 280 nm is 10. The partial specific volume as calculated from the amino acid composition is 0.74."

https://openalex.org/W1637678871,"Abstract Superinduction is a phenomenon frequently observed in eukaryotic cells, whereby the inhibition of RNA synthesis (usually with actinomycin D) results in an increase in the concentration (activity) of a specific protein. This paper shows that actinomycin D can superinduce the major egg white proteins synthesized in chick magnum. After actinomycin D treatment, ovalbumin, conalbumin, ovomucoid, and lysozyme became an increased percentage of the total protein synthesized regardless of whether (a) the drug was administered to chicks or added to magnum explants in culture; and (b) protein synthesis was measured in vivo or in culture. Whereas the rate of nonsecretory protein synthesis declined with a half-life of about 5 hours after actinomycin D treatment of magnum explants, the rates of ovalbumin and conalbumin synthesis declined with half-lives of 14 and 8 hours, respectively. Furthermore, actinomycin D increased the absolute rate of ovalbumin and conalbumin synthesis compared to untreated controls, despite a small decrease in the number of polysomes and the concentration of total ovalbumin mRNA. Polypeptide elongation normally limits the rate of protein synthesis in the estrogen-stimulated magnum. Two independent methods reveal that actinomycin D treatment increased the rate of elongation 10 to 40%. The average polysome size, and the size of ovalbumin-synthesizing polysomes in particular, was maintained when actinomycin D was administered to estrogen-stimulated chicks indicating that there was a corresponding increase in the rate of initiation. During hormonal withdrawal, when initiation limits the rate of protein synthesis, actinomycin D treatment resulted in larger polysomes and an increased rate of elongation compared to untreated controls, suggesting that actinomycin D enhanced the rate of polypeptide initiation more than elongation. We propose a model to explain superinduction in this system which is based on (a) differential stability of mRNAs; and (b) competition of mRNAs for rate-limiting factors common to the translation of all mRNAs. Hence, after inhibiting RNA synthesis, the long lived mRNAs increase in proportion to the total mRNA population remaining, and can be translated at an increased rate because of more favorable competition for the rate-limiting factors."
https://openalex.org/W1502925679,"Abstract A cell envelope particulate fraction from an encapsulated strain of Bacillus licheniformis ATCC 9945A contains a polyglutamyl synthetase which catalyzes the polymerization of l-glutamic acid to form a high molecular weight polymer of γ-d-glutamic acid. The reaction, which is specific for l-glutamic acid, requires ATP and Mg2+ ion and is stimulated by K+ ion and dithiothreitol. A nearly 2-fold increase in activity is observed in the presence of optimal levels of glycerol (0.1 m) and dimethylsulfoxide (0.1 m). The Km for l-glutamic acid is 0.5 mm. d-Glutamic acid is not incorporated nor does it influence the polymerization of the l isomer. Glutamyl dipeptides inhibited polyglutamyl synthetase activity. The cell envelope-associated polyglutamyl synthetase does not require an RNA template since it is refractory to treatment with RNase. It is also not inhibited by chloramphenicol, actinomycin D, puromycin, or rifampicin. Thus, the mechanism of capsular polymer formation is uniquely different from that involved in normal protein synthesis. Pre-treatment of the particulate fraction with Pronase destroyed its ability to synthesize the capsular polymer. Since a molar excess of [12C]α-ketoglutarate had no effect on the incorporation of l-[14C]glutamic acid, the subsequent interconversion of the glutamyl optical antipodes does not involve a series of glutamyl transamination and alanine racemization reactions in which α-ketoglutarate is a key intermediate. These reactions have been demonstrated in soluble extracts from B. licheniformis and have been shown to be one mechanism to account for the formation of d-glutamic acid from the l isomer. The observation that l-glutamine also has no effect on l-glutamic acid incorporation rules out the possible involvement of a transamidation reaction between glutamine and l- or d-glutamic acid. Polymer formation does not involve a series of transpeptidation reactions between glutamyl dipeptides since dipeptides inhibit polymer synthesis. Although the precise mechanism of activation, racemization, and polymerization is not fully understood, the results of these studies establish that the poly(γ-d-glutamyl) capsule is synthesized by a sequence of membrane-associated enzymatic reactions. No evidence for the involvement of small molecular weight oligopeptides as free intermediates has been obtained. The enzymatically synthesized α-d-glutamyl polymers were readily isolated by virtue of their complete resistance to hydrolysis by Pronase. After treatment with this protease, molecular sieve chromatography resulted in the quantitative isolation of the capsular polymers. Glutamic acid was the only labeled amino acid recovered following acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the purified product. The specific activity of the glutamic acid was 90% that of the initial specific activity which indicates a considerable amount of de novo synthesis. Subsequent chemical, physical, and enzymatic analyses have confirmed that the enzymatically synthesized polymers are structurally identical with the capsular γ-d-glutamyl polymers synthesized in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1507064290,"Abstract Vitamin A-deficient rats have low levels of retinol-binding protein (RBP) in serum and elevated levels of RBP in their livers. Chylomicrons containing newly absorbed vitamin A were injected intravenously into vitamin A-deficient rats, and the levels of vitamin A and of RBP in serum were determined on samples collected serially from individual rats. Data were also obtained on liver immunoreactive RBP concentrations with samples obtained at death. Chylomicrons were used so that the vitamin could be administered physiologically, in the form in which it is normally absorbed. After the injection of chylomicrons containing vitamin A a rapid increase in the serum levels of RBP and of vitamin A occurred, with maximal levels observed at 2 to 4 hours. The magnitude of the response was directly related to the amount of vitamin A given, in the dose range 0 to 17 µg of vitamin A. In an initial study of the dose range of 0 to 32 µg, a maximal response was obtained with doses of 16 µg or greater. Substantial increases in serum RBP levels were observed soon after chylomicron clearance, by 45 min after chylomicron injection. Livers were obtained 2 hours after chylomicron injection in rats given graded amounts of vitamin A. The dose-response relationship of the increase in serum RBP was mirrored by a complementary dose-related decrease in the level of RBP in the liver. Release of RBP from liver into serum, which was a function of the amount of vitamin A given, apparently occurred. Rats pretreated with either puromycin or cycloheximide also showed a rapid and substantial rise in serum RBP and vitamin A levels, after the injection of vitamin A. The results indicate that the increased level of RBP in serum after vitamin A injection mainly represents the release of previously formed RBP from an existing pool in the liver, rather than representing newly synthesized protein. The secretion of RBP by the liver is regulated efficiently by the availability of vitamin A for the formation of the retinol-RBP complex."
https://openalex.org/W1486202353,"Calcium was essential for the K+ release mediated by the epinephrine α-receptor in rat parotid slices. The pattern of K+ release was the same, whether calcium or epinephrine was added as the last component. Mg2+ appeared to compete with Ca2+ and partially inhibited K+ release. Reuptake of K+ into the slices could be initiated either by chelation of the Ca2+ with ethylene glycol bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N′-tetraacetic acid or by inhibition of the epinephrine α-receptor with phentolamine. It was therefore concluded that both Ca2+ and epinephrine are required not only to initiate the reaction but also to maintain it. Ouabain, an inhibitor of the Na+,K+-activated ATPase prevented the reuptake of K+. This inhibitor enhanced K+ release caused by epinephrine but did not induce K+ release in absence of the hormone. It is suggested that the extent of K+ release is the resultant of efflux mediated by the epinephrine α-receptor and influx mediated by the Na+, K+-activated ATPase. It is concluded that energy is required for the epinephrine-induced K+ release since dinitrophenol as well as a nitrogen atmosphere inhibited K+ efflux from the slices."

https://openalex.org/W1517834101,"Abstract Two forms of DNA polymerase have been partially purified about 100- to 200-fold from calf thymus by fractionation with streptomycin, acid precipitation, and chromatography on phosphocellulose, DEAE-cellulose, and agarose gel. The molecular weights of the enzymes were estimated to be about 2 x 105 (polymerase A) and 1.5 x 105 (polymerase B) by sedimentation in glycerol gradient. The activity of both enzymes was optimal in the presence of Mg++ and all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates. Denatured DNA was more active as a template than native DNA for both polymerases. Polymerase A, but not polymerase B, appeared to be free of detectable 3'-exonucleases activity. Both polymerases contained some endonuclease activity. Using denatured sonicated DNA as template the apparent Km values of polymerases A and B for dTTP were estimated to be about 6 and 10 µm, respectively. At low ionic strength both polymerases bind to denatured DNA but not to native DNA as studied by glycerol gradient centrifugation. N-Ethylmaleimide (0.5 mm) inhibited polymerases A and B by 50 and 35%, respectively. The nucleotide analog 1-β-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate at a concentration of 20 µm inhibited both enzymes by about 70%."
https://openalex.org/W1542063267,"Abstract The 0.5 m KCl wash fraction of rabbit liver microsomes has been fractionated by DEAE-cellulose chromatography into the protein synthesis initiation factors IF-M1, IF-M2(a+b), and IF-M3. IF-M2(a+b) was also separated into two components, IF-M2a and IF-M2b, by Sephadex G-200 chromatography. Further purification of the factors was obtained by ammonium sulfate fractionation, ion exchange chromatography, and/or gel filtration chromatography. The chromatographic behavior of the liver initiation factors on ion exchange resins and Sephadex G-200 is very similar to that of the reticulocyte factors at comparable stages of purification. Furthermore, there is a high degree of interchangeability of liver and reticulocyte IF-M1, IF-M2a, and IF-M2b in polyphenylalanine synthesis and also in the Met-tRNAfmet binding assay. Liver IF-M3 substitutes for reticulocyte IF-M3 in endogenous and exogenous mRNA-directed protein synthesis and in single peptide bond formation assays. These findings suggest that liver initiation factors IF-M1, IF-M2a, IF-M2b, and IF-M3 are identical, or at least very similar, to the corresponding reticulocyte factors."
https://openalex.org/W1495151785,"Abstract Diphosphoglycerate mutase, purified to apparent homogeneity from human erythrocytes, was found to have a molecular weight of 60,000 (gel filtration) and subunit weight of 32,000 (electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate). One [32P]phosphoryl group is covalently bound per subunit upon incubation of enzyme with either the 32P-labeled substrate, 1,3-diphosphoglycerate, or the product, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. The phosphate group is transferred to either 2- or 3-phosphoglycerate or to water if glycolate-2-P is added to phosphorylated enzyme. The phosphoryl group was stable at alkaline pH but was liberated from the denatured phosphoprotein in the acid range at rates consistent with a phosphoramidate linkage to histidine. Since a similar phosphorylation reaction had been shown previously with monophosphoglycerate mutase, it was necessary to achieve complete separation in the preparation of the enzyme."

Proof that the optical configuration of the glutamyl residues in the enzymatically synthesized polymer and the native capsular polymer is d, has been provided by (a) chromatographic separation of diastereoisomeric dipeptides obtained by derivatization with l-leucine-N-carboxyanhydride, and (b) gas-liquid chromatographic separation of N-trifluoroacetyl-l-prolylglutamyl dipeptide methyl esters. The amide linkage has been shown to be γ by (a) kinetics of mild acid catalyzed hydrolysis and (b) LiBH4 reduction of the methyl ester of the polymer followed by acid hydrolysis which yielded γ-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid. Identical treatment of an authentic poly(α-d-glutamyl) polymer yielded α-amino-δ-hydroxyvaleric acid. Neither the enzymatically synthesized polymers nor the native capsular polymers synthesized in vivo contained any ester, anhydride, or lactone linkages. Detailed ultracentrifugal studies have established that the biosynthetic polymers are polydisperse with weight-average molecular weight distribution values ranging from 1.72 x 105 to 3.63 x 105. Similar studies carried out on native γ-d-glutamyl capsular polymers synthesized in vivo showed a much greater degree of polydispersity with apparent weight-average molecular weight distribution values ranging from 8.4 x 104 to 1.15 x 106. The biosynthetic polymers are susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by a poly(γ-d-glutamyl) depolymerase. This enzyme, which readily hydrolyzed the native capsular polymer, showed no activity against authentic α-l-glutamyl polymers. These data provide additional evidence that the product of the membrane-mediated reaction is structurally identical with the native capsular γ-d-glutamyl polymers synthesized in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2090289634,Significant changes were found in two indices of the averaged visual evoked potentials in nine smokers after 12 and 36 hours of abstinence and after resumption of smoking. There was a decrease of the amplitude envelope accompanying withdrawal and an increase with resumption of smoking. These changes are consistent with the contention that tobacco increases arousal. Amplitude changes were found in a specific component of the evoked potential occurring between 100 and 125 milliseconds after the onset of the flash. The latter changes suggest the possibility that smoking selectively enhances the perceptiont of weak stimuli.
https://openalex.org/W1497393655,"Abstract The template response of a purified DNA polymerase from regenerating rat liver has been studied. This enzyme does not copy a polyribonucleotide template; however, the ribo strand of a synthetic RNA-DNA hybrid can be used as an initiator for the synthesis of the complementary deoxyribo strand. This enzyme also has a marked preference for at least partially single stranded polydeoxyribonucleotide templates. The copolymer poly[d(A-T)·d(T-A)] is multiplied 4- or 8-fold. The single stranded poly(dA) acts as an efficient template for the regenerating rat liver DNA polymerase, provided short complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide initiators are added. Poly(dC) is used as a template without added initiator. Synthesis of the complementary polydeoxyribonucleotide continues in both cases until an amount of polymer equal to the amount of initial template is produced. The enzyme does not copy poly(dG), either in a single stranded form in the presence of oligo(dC) or in a duplex form such as poly[(dC)·(dG)]. The specificities detected with synthetic polymers show that this DNA-dependent DNA polymerase is distinguishable from RNA-dependent DNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W1566288065,"Abstract Hemoglobins from three sharks, the porbeagle (Lamna nasus), the dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus), and the mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), and four bony fishes, the big-eye tuna (Thunnus obesus), the swordfish (Xiphias gladius), the carp (Cyprius carpio), and the smallmouth bass (Micropetrus dolomieu), have been examined by a variety of techniques to determine both their molecular structure and their kinetic and equilibrium ligand-binding properties. For all species multiple hemoglobins were found in the hemolysates. These hemoglobins are tetrameric and exhibit cooperative ligand binding. The main components of the hemolysates from the oceanic species consist of either three or four electrophoretically separable globin chains. However, the hemolysates behave as if they contain only two distinct functional components which appear to be present within the same tetrameric molecule. These two types of ligand-binding sites exhibit different kinetic and spectral properties for the carbon monoxide-binding reaction and for the displacement of oxygen by carbon monoxide. At 20° the differences between the rates of oxygen dissociation from these two components are largest for the hemoglobins of the mako shark (22.7 s-1 and 1.86 s-1) and those of the swordfish (28.2 s-1 and 4.8 s-1). Similar albeit smaller differences were observed for porbeagle, dusky, big-eye tuna, and carp hemolysates. The carbon monoxide-binding reactions of these hemolysates were also separable into a fast and slow component with all species showing a rapid reaction on the short wave length side of the 425 nm isosbestic point and a slower reaction on the long wave length side. With the possible exception of big-eye tuna hemoglobin, all of the fish and shark hemoglobins appear to interact with organic phosphates with a stoichiometry of 1 mole bound per mole of hemoglobin tetramer. At neutral pH inositol hexaphosphate lowers the rate of CO binding to swordfish and bass hemoglobins by a factor of 10 to 20 but appears to affect only half of the heme sites. Although less dramatically, this organic phosphate also lowers the rate of CO binding to the shark hemoglobins. The oxygen equilibrium curves of porbeagle and big-eye tuna hemoglobins change shape with temperature, but the concentration of oxygen at 50% saturation for the former is independent of temperature and that of the latter varies only slightly in going from 35 to 5°. The basis of this unusually small temperature dependence lies in a differential temperature response of the two types of functional components which appear to be present within the same tetramer. For big-eye tuna hemoglobin, the rate of oxygen dissociation for one of the components is the same at 3° as it is at 20°, approximately 50 s-1. For porbeagle hemoglobin, the rate of ligand association to one of the components present in the deoxygenated hemolysate is 36 times smaller at 3° than at 20°. Both of these responses produce unusually low affinity species at 3°."

https://openalex.org/W1485203524,"Abstract The anthranilate synthase purified from Pseudomonas putida, is composed of 1 molecule each of two dissimilar protein components. With molecular weights of 63,400 (Component I, or AS I) and 18,000 (Component II, AS II), the pure protein components are free of chorismate mutase, and the enzymes responsible for converting anthranilate to tryptophan but retain trace l-glutaminase activities detectable only by radioisotope assay. Using the determined amino acid composition for each component, the millimolar extinction coefficients for AS I and AS II were calculated to be 5.6 and 0.9, respectively. The experimentally determined millimolar extinction coefficients were 4.4 (AS I) and 1.1 (AS II). AS I and AS II have respective specific activities of 4.7 and 17 in the conversion of chorismate to anthranilate with glutamine as nitrogen source. For this amidetransfer to occur AS II must bind AS I; high glutamine (10 mm) enhances the binding of AS I and II, as does magnesium ion, also required for the amidetransfer. The Km values for chorismate and glutamine in anthranilate synthesis at optimum pH 7.8 are 7 and 600 µm, respectively. At optimum pH 8.8, AS I by itself converts chorismate and ammonia to anthranilate at a rate greater than the maximum for the amidetransfer. The rate of this amination decreases sharply as pH is lowered to neutrality but is unaffected by the addition of AS II. With AS II present and at optimum pH the respective Km values for chorismate and ammonium ion are 0.09 and 26 mm. AS I and II play a joint role in the binding of l-glutamine since [14C]glutamine shows negligible binding to either component alone but does bind to an equimolar mixture of AS I and II with Kd = 14 µm. Additional evidence for this joint role derives from the requirement for the presence of AS I and glutamine for protection of AS II against inactivation by bromopyruvate. Glutamine analogs 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and azaserine inactivate amidetransfer but not amination. The inactivation is delayed but not prevented by higher levels of l-glutamine. Inactivation is markedly stimulated by the presence of chorismate. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the increased inactivation rates showed an apparent Km for chorismate of 10 µm. Although both AS I and AS II must be incubated with 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine to achieve full inactivation, resolution of 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine-inactivated anthranilate synthase into its two nonidentical components yields an active AS I and an inactive AS II. The inactivated AS II is reactivated by sulfhydryl compounds such as 2-mercaptoethanol.

In the presence of either l-cysteine sulfinate or l-aspartate, however, bromopyruvate rapidly inactivated both isozymes. Bromopyruvate also acted as a keto acid substrate in the conversion of the pyridoxamine form of both enzymes to their pyridoxal forms. This finding, together with the demonstration of the equimolar formation of oxalacetate, pyruvate, and ammonia from l-aspartate and bromopyruvate, supported the following reaction sequences: [see PDF for equation] [see PDF for equation] where Em is the pyridoxamine form and El the pyridoxal form of these enzymes. A kinetic study of these reactions revealed that inactivation occurs during Reaction I. Spectral and chemical analyses showed that the coenzyme in both inactivated enzymes is present as pyridoxamine phosphate and the carbon 3 moiety of bromopyruvate is covalently bound to the enzyme active sites. This finding indicates that bromopyruvate is an efficient affinity label for the pyridoxamine form of each isozyme. Kinetics of the incorporation of bromo[2-14C]pyruvate and chemical analyses of modified amino acid residues demonstrated that inactivation of each isozyme resulted from alkylation of an essential cysteinyl residue in the active region by bromopyruvate."
https://openalex.org/W1544360461,"Abstract An enzyme from Vibrio 01 catalyzing cis-trans isomerization of maleylacetone has been identified and purified. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 35,000 and appears to be a single unit. Its density is low compared to other proteins. Glutathione is specifically required as a coenzyme. Treatment of the enzyme with sodium borohydride in the presence of substrate and GSH leads to increased activity while in the absence of substrate, treatment with sodium borohydride leads to inhibition. Formation of a Schiff base intermediate between substrate and enzyme appears to be unlikely. N-Ethylmaleimide leads to inactivation of enzyme and suggests the importance of one or more thiol groups near the active site. Other inhibitors and potential inhibitors have been tested. The enzyme also isomerized maleylacetoacetate at a slightly faster rate."

https://openalex.org/W1544917770,"Abstract The first step in the decomposition of 3,5-diaminohexanoate by the aerobic Brevibacterium L5 was found to be a DPN-dependent oxidative deamination. The product was identified as 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate by its chemical properties and by comparison with previously characterized 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate prepared with a clostridial enzyme. Decarboxylation of the Brevibacterium product followed by hypoiodite oxidation yielded 3-aminobutyric acid which was shown to have the l(3 S) configuration. Consequently, 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate has the l(5 S) configuration. The dehydrogenase catalyzing the oxidative deamination was purified about 70-fold with a 60% yield. Its molecular weight, estimated by gel filtration, is about 71,000. The enzyme is highly specific for its substrates, l-erythro-3,5-diaminohexanoate and l-3-keto-5-aminohexanoate. Some kinetic properties of the enzyme are reported. The further degradation of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate by dialyzed extracts requires catalytic amounts of acetyl-CoA and is stimulated by coenzyme A under some conditions. The main products are acetate, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate, and smaller amounts of β-aminobutyrate and coenzyme A thioesters of some of these products. By means of tracer experiments, acetate and acetoacetate were shown to be derived mainly from carbon atoms 1 and 2 of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate, whereas β-hydroxybutyrate is derived mainly from carbon atoms 3 to 6. A possible pathway of 3-keto-5-aminohexanoate degradation is described."
https://openalex.org/W1596856156,"Abstract The oxidative conversion of 20α-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone by adrenal cortex mitochondria has been studied and correlated with the spectral change produced by this substrate in these particles. The difference spectrum produced by 20α-hydroxycholesterol in the absence of suitable electron donors is a characteristic type II spectrum. Under conditions allowing mixed function oxidation of its side chain, this spectrum loses its 420-nm peak concomitant with a marked acceleration of oxygen consumption and the appearance of pregnenolone and other products. Depletion of sterol substrate in these cases is accompanied by a return of the absorbance at 420 nm as well as a return in the rate of oxygen uptake to presterol levels. The conversion is found to be much less sensitive to metyrapone inhibition than is steroid 11β-hydroxylation. Pregnenolone and aminoglutethimide both inhibit side chain cleavage of 20α-hydroxycholesterol at moderately high concentrations. Like metyrapone, these substances interact with cytochrome P-450 in this tissue producing type II difference spectra with estimated dissociation constants smaller than the concentrations required to inhibit the oxidative side chain cleavage of 20α-hydroxycholesterol."

https://openalex.org/W1543476742,"Abstract A nuclease has been isolated from T4-infected Escherichia coli which attacks single- or double-stranded DNA from a variety of sources, including T4. The enzyme appears late during the T4 development, and its action is dependent on the presence of —SH reagents and Mg++ or Mn++ ions. The rate and extent of the reaction on single-stranded DNA is about 10-fold higher in the presence of Mn++ than in the presence of Mg++. Single and double-strand breakage of native DNA was observed in reaction mixtures containing Mn++ while no reaction with native DNA was detected in the presence of Mg++. The products of the enzymatic reaction include oligonucleotides which contain 3'-OH and 5'-phosphate ends. While all four nucleotides are found at the 5' end, a preference toward A and T was noted. T4 mutants in genes 49, 16, or 17 which lead to defects in phage maturation induce wild type levels of the nuclease. In contrast, T4 mutants in gene 43 (T4 DNA polymerase) do not induce late functions and for this reason do not induce the Mn++-activated nuclease."

It causes a decrease in size of the compound action potential of the nonmnyelinated fibers of the vagus nerve of the rabbit. This effect appears to be dose-related and chloride-dependent. Effects on other measurable parameters of nerve function seem to be minimal. Although the amounts required seem to be higher than those required to produce hallucinogenic effects in man, this effect is consistent with other work on Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and may ultimately account for a significant portion of the pharmacological activity of this drug."

The same type of inheritance has occurred in the mouse. Female mice heterozygous for the reciprocal translocation T(14;15)6Ca have produced a high frequency of translocation trisomic offspring. Male mice heterozygous for the same translocation have produced no translocation trisomic offspring. Thus, the laboratory mouse may provide a model for studying the cause of this phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W1540042724,"Abstract The time course of polyphenylalanine synthesis at 37° is characterized by an initial period (the lag period) of accelerating rate of phenylalanine incorporation that precedes the linear phase of synthesis. We show that during this lag period an initial complex must form by the binding of poly(U) and then phenylalanyl transfer ribonucleic acid to the monomeric ribosome. The rate of phenylalanyl-tRNA binding but not the binding of poly(U) is dependent on elongation factor 1 concentration. Moreover, the concentration of elongation factor 1 required to produce half-maximum rate of phenylalanyl-tRNA binding to the poly(U)-ribosome complex is much greater than that required to produce half-maximum rate of phenylalanyl tRNA binding to an elongating monosome. Therefore, the rate of phenylalanine incorporation is initially controlled by the rate of entry of monomeric ribosomes into the pool of elongating monosomes. We have also shown that aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), an inhibitor of natural factor-dependent initiation, also selectively inhibits synthesis of polyphenylalanine at 12 mm Mg2+ by preventing the binding of poly(U) and therefore of phenylalanyl-tRNA to the ribosome. ATA (10-5 m) dissociates the poly(U)-ribosome complex at 37°, but is without effect once phenylalanyl-tRNA has bound to this complex. ATA (10-4 m), but not 10-5 m ATA, inhibits elongation by disaggregating the 80 S ribosome."

He quoted the work of Mulholland and Evans4,5 which suggested that presence or absence of alpha rhythms was not determined by the presence or absence of relaxed wakefulness, but by oculomotor function. Many arguments have been presented against such a hypothesis6–9, Butler and Glass10 have presented findings inconsistent in a number of respects with the view of ocular tremor as a generator of alpha rhythm, and suggested that eye movements in their turn may be modulated by alpha rhythms when conscious control of fixation waned or was interrupted by eye closure. Chapman et al.11 repeated the basic experiments of Mulholland and Evans4,5, taking care to eliminate effects of differential visual input, and demonstrated that alpha activity was influenced by visual input and not by eye position."
