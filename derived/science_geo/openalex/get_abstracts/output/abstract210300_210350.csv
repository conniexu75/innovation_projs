https://openalex.org/W2078300312,"""Movement-detecting"" units that respond little or not at all to illumination without movement, respond to change in position under stroboscopic light even when relatively large jumps in the visual field occur during a dark pause between two flashes. The threshold angle and angular velocity are different for different classes of units. They are higher for the periphery of the receptive field and increase with decreasing contrast. An inhibitory effect of a large surrounding of the receptive field coluld be demonstrated in class-2 neurvons."

Renin appeared in much larger amounts in renal-vein blood than in renal lymph. Release of reruin appears to be mediated by a renal baroceptor rather than by ischemia."
https://openalex.org/W1978426637,"THE aqueous flare is a scattering phenomenon, which may be observed when a beam of light passes the anterior chamber of the eye. It is caused by the presence of substances with large molecules (proteins). Using a photographic apparatus1 for measuring the intensity of the flare, Anjou, Krakau and Stigmar2 observed that an injection of chromatographically pure preparations of ACTH may cause an increase, sometimes quite impressive, of the flare density in normal eyes of rabbits. The maximum density occurred about 3 h after the injection; then the flare intensity faded slowly. The flare effect was regularly accompanied by a reduction of the intraocular pressure. No effect could be seen after vasopressin."

Conversely, subtotal bilateral lesions of posterior cortex produced no significant deficit on the alternation habit but markedly impaired maze performance."

https://openalex.org/W1662150051,Ionene has been identified as a thermal degradation product of β-carotene. The 5-percent yield of ionene represents the largest amount of any compound thus far identified from the degradation. Experimental evidence has been obtained indicating the presence of ionene in a marine sediment ment subjected to the same temperature used to degrade β-carotene.

https://openalex.org/W2086189614,The effects of behavioral stress on mice during pregnancy on the behavior of offspring are mimicked by epinephrine injection of mice during pregnancy; hydrocortisone and norepinephrine injection also produce behaviroal changes in the offspring. Similar results were obtained in chicks hatched from injected eggs.

https://openalex.org/W2098319672,"Triiodothyronine administered to thyroidectomized rats preferentially increased the total capacity of the electron transport phosphorylation system when isolated mitochondria from the liver were tested with different substrates, but it caused little increase in the activity of the slowest dehydrogenases and no uncoupling. The increased activity appeared to be partly due to direct activation of some component of the electron transport system, although triiodothyronine injection also stimulated the incorporation of amino acids by isolated mitochondria."

https://openalex.org/W2061511956,"A chromatograph of normal rabbit serum shows three major peaks of amylase activity. Material associated with each peak differed in composition of serum protein, electrophoretic distribution of amylolytic activity, optimum pH for activity and Michaelis-Menten constants for starch hydrolysis. These data suggest but do not prove conclusively that normal rabbit serum contains at least three molecular forms of amylase."

https://openalex.org/W2075734719,"Deutsch's theory of intracranial self-stimulation generates experimental predictions regarding the effects of both free stimulation of the brain and the pre-extinction training procedure on extinction behavior after rewarding stimulation of the brain. The results of one experiment confirmed the prediction regarding free stimulation; the other experiment did not provide the expected result. We concluded that Deutsch's theory, in its present form, is of restricted enerality."

https://openalex.org/W1998998119,"Rats with mammillary body lesions produced with an angled approach do not show a ""scalloping"" in their behavioral records during fixed-interval reinforcement. Control experiments suggest that this effect was due to the electrode piercing the zona incerta, implicating the participation of extrapyramidal structures in timing behavior."

https://openalex.org/W2001315526,"A specific precipitate of ovalbumin and its rabbit-serum antibody, after fixing human serum complement, was digested with papain. The digest was analyzed immunochemically for complexes of antigen, antibody fragments, and components of complement. The results indicated that complement is not bound to Porter fragment III, but very likely is bound to fragments I and II."

https://openalex.org/W1971812505,"ALTHOUGH many extensive investigations in animals1–3 have demonstrated the existence of renal medullary hyperosmolality suggestive of a counter-current mechanism of urine concentration, direct evidence of medullary hyperosmolality in man has never been obtained hitherto. We have examined the tissue concentrations of sodium, potassium, urea and ammonia in human kidneys removed at operation or shortly after death, using standard techniques4."

https://openalex.org/W1998851721,"ANTIBODY production after immunization with particulate antigens is known to persist over long periods of time. By contrast, immunization with soluble antigens in the absence of adjuvants is generally thought to give responses of relatively brief duration. Recently, it has been reported that antibody production continued for several hundred days in rabbits given one or several intravenous injections of a number of soluble antigens1. Antibody produced late in the course of the response gave negative ring tests, failed to sensitize the guinea pig intestine, and could be detected only by a passive hæmagglutination technique. This communication is concerned with similar observations on the response of chickens to intravenous injections of bovine serum albumin (BSA). One major finding of this study is the persistence of precipitating antibody up to 313 days after injection."
https://openalex.org/W2003497350,"Two methods were used to develop tolerance in the host toward donor cells. In the first method chicken embryos were joined by the parabiotic union of the chorioallantoic membranes after 9 days of incubation. The second method consisted of the use of embryonic transplants of limb buds from donor embryo to host embryo. These transplants were made after 96 hours of incubation with chicken embryos. Other species used were incubated to comparable development. Both methods were successful in the development of tolerance. However, the degree of tolerance attained varied within each method."
https://openalex.org/W2045612242,"Assuming fear to be a variable of importance in the inhibition of aggressive behavior, we used acetophenazine to try to facilitate fighting in mature male C57BL mice. Drugged pairs did not differ significantly from controls in fighting latency; however, the time lapse from the first fight to submission and the actual fighting time to submission were significantly longer for drugged pairs. An attempt is made to relate what is known of the action of the drug with research on the neural correlates of aggressive behavior."

The ability to reject a first-set xenogeneic (heterologous) skin graft with normal vigor returned within 92 days; the first-set response to allogeneic (homologous) grafts was still impaired 350 days after irradiation.

There is urgent need for agreement on these two criteria and particularly on a common centring point."
