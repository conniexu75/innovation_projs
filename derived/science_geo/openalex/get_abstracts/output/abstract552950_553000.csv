https://openalex.org/W2257132471,"Mutations in DMD disrupt the reading frame, prevent dystrophin translation, and cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Here we describe a CRISPR/Cas9 platform applicable to 60% of DMD patient mutations. We applied the platform to DMD-derived hiPSCs where successful deletion and non-homologous end joining of up to 725 kb reframed the DMD gene. This is the largest CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion shown to date in DMD. Use of hiPSCs allowed evaluation of dystrophin in disease-relevant cell types. Cardiomyocytes and skeletal muscle myotubes derived from reframed hiPSC clonal lines had restored dystrophin protein. The internally deleted dystrophin was functional as demonstrated by improved membrane integrity and restoration of the dystrophin glycoprotein complex in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, miR31 was reduced upon reframing, similar to observations in Becker muscular dystrophy. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using a single CRISPR pair to correct the reading frame for the majority of DMD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2286410651,"This study demonstrates that fear memory expression is driven by 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal–amygdala circuits. During fear behavior, prefrontal 4-Hz oscillations lead amygdala and synchronize spiking activity between the two structures. Ultimately, this study identifies 4-Hz oscillations as a physiological signature of fear memories. Fear expression relies on the coordinated activity of prefrontal and amygdala circuits, yet the mechanisms allowing long-range network synchronization during fear remain unknown. Using a combination of extracellular recordings, pharmacological and optogenetic manipulations, we found that freezing, a behavioral expression of fear, temporally coincided with the development of sustained, internally generated 4-Hz oscillations in prefrontal–amygdala circuits. 4-Hz oscillations predict freezing onset and offset and synchronize prefrontal–amygdala circuits. Optogenetic induction of prefrontal 4-Hz oscillations coordinates prefrontal–amygdala activity and elicits fear behavior. These results unravel a sustained oscillatory mechanism mediating prefrontal–amygdala coupling during fear behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2275273192,"RAR-related orphan receptor-γt (ROR-γt) directs differentiation of proinflammatory T helper 17 (TH17) cells and is a potential therapeutic target in chronic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, ROR-γt-dependent group 3 innate lymphoid cells ILC3s provide essential immunity and tissue protection in the intestine, suggesting that targeting ROR-γt could also result in impaired host defense after infection or enhanced tissue damage. Here, we demonstrate that transient chemical inhibition of ROR-γt in mice selectively reduces cytokine production from TH17 but not ILCs in the context of intestinal infection with Citrobacter rodentium, resulting in preserved innate immunity. Temporal deletion of Rorc (encoding ROR-γt) in mature ILCs also did not impair cytokine response in the steady state or during infection. Finally, pharmacologic inhibition of ROR-γt provided therapeutic benefit in mouse models of intestinal inflammation and reduced the frequency of TH17 cells but not ILCs isolated from primary intestinal samples of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Collectively, these results reveal differential requirements for ROR-γt in the maintenance of TH17 cell and ILC3 responses and suggest that transient inhibition of ROR-γt is a safe and effective therapeutic approach during intestinal inflammation."

https://openalex.org/W2274764336,"Impaired erythropoiesis in the deletion 5q (del(5q)) subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) has been linked to heterozygous deletion of RPS14, which encodes the ribosomal protein small subunit 14. We generated mice with conditional inactivation of Rps14 and demonstrated an erythroid differentiation defect that is dependent on the tumor suppressor protein p53 (encoded by Trp53 in mice) and is characterized by apoptosis at the transition from polychromatic to orthochromatic erythroblasts. This defect resulted in age-dependent progressive anemia, megakaryocyte dysplasia and loss of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence. As assessed by quantitative proteomics, mutant erythroblasts expressed higher levels of proteins involved in innate immune signaling, notably the heterodimeric S100 calcium-binding proteins S100a8 and S100a9. S100a8--whose expression was increased in mutant erythroblasts, monocytes and macrophages--is functionally involved in the erythroid defect caused by the Rps14 deletion, as addition of recombinant S100a8 was sufficient to induce a differentiation defect in wild-type erythroid cells, and genetic inactivation of S100a8 expression rescued the erythroid differentiation defect of Rps14-haploinsufficient HSCs. Our data link Rps14 haploinsufficiency in del(5q) MDS to activation of the innate immune system and induction of S100A8-S100A9 expression, leading to a p53-dependent erythroid differentiation defect."
https://openalex.org/W2284978990,"Varun Aggarwala and Benjamin Voight analyze human polymorphism data and develop an expanded sequence context model that explains >81% of variability in substitution probabilities, highlighting mutation-promoting motifs. Using their model, they present substitution intolerance scores for genes and a new intolerance score for amino acids, and demonstrate clinical use of the model in neuropsychiatric diseases. The rate of single-nucleotide polymorphism varies substantially across the human genome and fundamentally influences evolution and incidence of genetic disease. Previous studies have only considered the immediately flanking nucleotides around a polymorphic site—the site's trinucleotide sequence context—to study polymorphism levels across the genome. Moreover, the impact of larger sequence contexts has not been fully clarified, even though context substantially influences rates of polymorphism. Using a new statistical framework and data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we demonstrate that a heptanucleotide context explains >81% of variability in substitution probabilities, highlighting new mutation-promoting motifs at ApT dinucleotide, CAAT and TACG sequences. Our approach also identifies previously undocumented variability in C-to-T substitutions at CpG sites, which is not immediately explained by differential methylation intensity. Using our model, we present informative substitution intolerance scores for genes and a new intolerance score for amino acids, and we demonstrate clinical use of the model in neuropsychiatric diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2262375366,"Several studies have reported reprogramming of fibroblasts into induced cardiomyocytes; however, reprogramming into proliferative induced cardiac progenitor cells (iCPCs) remains to be accomplished. Here we report that a combination of 11 or 5 cardiac factors along with canonical Wnt and JAK/STAT signaling reprogrammed adult mouse cardiac, lung, and tail tip fibroblasts into iCPCs. The iCPCs were cardiac mesoderm-restricted progenitors that could be expanded extensively while maintaining multipotency to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in vitro. Moreover, iCPCs injected into the cardiac crescent of mouse embryos differentiated into cardiomyocytes. iCPCs transplanted into the post-myocardial infarction mouse heart improved survival and differentiated into cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells. Lineage reprogramming of adult somatic cells into iCPCs provides a scalable cell source for drug discovery, disease modeling, and cardiac regenerative therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2278141069,"Nucleoporins are essential components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Only a few diseases have been attributed to NPC dysfunction. Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a frequent cause of chronic kidney disease, is caused by dysfunction of glomerular podocytes. Here we identify in eight families with SRNS mutations in NUP93, its interaction partner NUP205 or XPO5 (encoding exportin 5) as hitherto unrecognized monogenic causes of SRNS. NUP93 mutations caused disrupted NPC assembly. NUP93 knockdown reduced the presence of NUP205 in the NPC, and, reciprocally, a NUP205 alteration abrogated NUP93 interaction. We demonstrate that NUP93 and exportin 5 interact with the signaling protein SMAD4 and that NUP93 mutations abrogated interaction with SMAD4. Notably, NUP93 mutations interfered with BMP7-induced SMAD transcriptional reporter activity. We hereby demonstrate that mutations of NUP genes cause a distinct renal disease and identify aberrant SMAD signaling as a new disease mechanism of SRNS, opening a potential new avenue for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2259562706,"By coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity and tuning the spins to the cavity resonance, the rate of spin relaxation is increased by three orders of magnitude compared to that of detuned spins; in such a regime, spontaneous emission of radiation is the dominant mechanism of spin relaxation. The Purcell effect, in which the slow rate of spontaneous emission from a quantum system is accelerated in a resonant cavity, is central to quantum optics. Here, Patrice Bertet and colleagues demonstrate an analogue of the Purcell effect in a system of spins in solids. The spontaneous emission in this system affects spin relaxation, and the authors show how to modulate spin relaxation through three orders of magnitude. This could give researchers a means of controlling and tuning spin relaxation. Spins in solids, in this case donor spins in silicon, are promising platforms for quantum information processing, and this technique could have ramifications for new spin qubit architectures. Spontaneous emission of radiation is one of the fundamental mechanisms by which an excited quantum system returns to equilibrium. For spins, however, spontaneous emission is generally negligible compared to other non-radiative relaxation processes because of the weak coupling between the magnetic dipole and the electromagnetic field. In 1946, Purcell realized1 that the rate of spontaneous emission can be greatly enhanced by placing the quantum system in a resonant cavity. This effect has since been used extensively to control the lifetime of atoms and semiconducting heterostructures coupled to microwave2 or optical3,4 cavities, and is essential for the realization of high-efficiency single-photon sources5. Here we report the application of this idea to spins in solids. By coupling donor spins in silicon to a superconducting microwave cavity with a high quality factor and a small mode volume, we reach the regime in which spontaneous emission constitutes the dominant mechanism of spin relaxation. The relaxation rate is increased by three orders of magnitude as the spins are tuned to the cavity resonance, demonstrating that energy relaxation can be controlled on demand. Our results provide a general way to initialize spin systems into their ground state and therefore have applications in magnetic resonance and quantum information processing6. They also demonstrate that the coupling between the magnetic dipole of a spin and the electromagnetic field can be enhanced up to the point at which quantum fluctuations have a marked effect on the spin dynamics; as such, they represent an important step towards the coherent magnetic coupling of individual spins to microwave photons."
https://openalex.org/W2277108862,"In this paper we propose an exoskeleton control method for adaptive learning of assistive joint torque profiles in periodic tasks. We use human muscle activity as feedback to adapt the assistive joint torque behaviour in a way that the muscle activity is minimised. The user can then relax while the exoskeleton takes over the task execution. If the task is altered and the existing assistive behaviour becomes inadequate, the exoskeleton gradually adapts to the new task execution so that the increased muscle activity caused by the new desired task can be reduced. The advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require biomechanical or dynamical models. Our proposed learning system uses Dynamical Movement Primitives (DMPs) as a trajectory generator and parameters of DMPs are modulated using Locally Weighted Regression. Then, the learning system is combined with adaptive oscillators that determine the phase and frequency of motion according to measured Electromyography (EMG) signals. We tested the method with real robot experiments where subjects wearing an elbow exoskeleton had to move an object of an unknown mass according to a predefined reference motion. We further evaluated the proposed approach on a whole-arm exoskeleton to show that it is able to adaptively derive assistive torques even for multiple-joint motion."
https://openalex.org/W2280487064,"Copper and zinc form an important group of hydroxycarbonate minerals that include zincian malachite, aurichalcite, rosasite and the exceptionally rare and unstable--and hence little known and largely ignored--georgeite. The first three of these minerals are widely used as catalyst precursors for the industrially important methanol-synthesis and low-temperature water-gas shift (LTS) reactions, with the choice of precursor phase strongly influencing the activity of the final catalyst. The preferred phase is usually zincian malachite. This is prepared by a co-precipitation method that involves the transient formation of georgeite; with few exceptions it uses sodium carbonate as the carbonate source, but this also introduces sodium ions--a potential catalyst poison. Here we show that supercritical antisolvent (SAS) precipitation using carbon dioxide (refs 13, 14), a process that exploits the high diffusion rates and solvation power of supercritical carbon dioxide to rapidly expand and supersaturate solutions, can be used to prepare copper/zinc hydroxycarbonate precursors with low sodium content. These include stable georgeite, which we find to be a precursor to highly active methanol-synthesis and superior LTS catalysts. Our findings highlight the value of advanced synthesis methods in accessing unusual mineral phases, and show that there is room for exploring improvements to established industrial catalysts."

https://openalex.org/W2285474081,"Alterations in long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are associated with human carcinogenesis. One group of lncRNAs, which are antisense in orientation to coding mRNAs (ASs), have been recently described in cancers but are poorly understood. We sought to identify ASs involved in human gastric cancer (GC) and to elucidate their mechanisms of action in carcinogenesis. We performed massively parallel RNA sequencing in GCs and matched normal tissues, as well as in GC-derived and normal gastric epithelial cell lines. One AS, designated Homo sapiens keratin 7 (KRT7-AS), was selected due to its marked upregulation and concordant expression with its cognate sense counterpart, KRT7, in GC tissues and cell lines. KRT7-AS formed an RNA–RNA hybrid with KRT7 and controlled KRT7 expression at both the mRNA and the post-transcriptional levels. Moreover, forced overexpression of the KRT7-overlapping region (OL) of KRT7-AS (but not its non-KRT7-OL portions) increased keratin 7 protein levels in cells. Finally, forced overexpression of full-length KRT7-AS or OL KRT7-AS (but not its non-KRT7-OL regions) promoted GC cell proliferation and migration. We conclude that lncRNA KRT7-AS promotes GC, at least in part, by increasing KRT7 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2281489610,"Functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity that quantifies the difference in functional traits between organisms. However, FD studies are often limited by the availability of trait data and FD indices are sensitive to data gaps. The distribution of species abundance and trait data, and its transformation, may further affect the accuracy of indices when data is incomplete. Using an existing approach, we simulated the effects of missing trait data by gradually removing data from a plant, an ant and a bird community dataset (12, 59, and 8 plots containing 62, 297 and 238 species respectively). We ranked plots by FD values calculated from full datasets and then from our increasingly incomplete datasets and compared the ranking between the original and virtually reduced datasets to assess the accuracy of FD indices when used on datasets with increasingly missing data. Finally, we tested the accuracy of FD indices with and without data transformation, and the effect of missing trait data per plot or per the whole pool of species. FD indices became less accurate as the amount of missing data increased, with the loss of accuracy depending on the index. But, where transformation improved the normality of the trait data, FD values from incomplete datasets were more accurate than before transformation. The distribution of data and its transformation are therefore as important as data completeness and can even mitigate the effect of missing data. Since the effect of missing trait values pool-wise or plot-wise depends on the data distribution, the method should be decided case by case. Data distribution and data transformation should be given more careful consideration when designing, analysing and interpreting FD studies, especially where trait data are missing. To this end, we provide the R package ""traitor"" to facilitate assessments of missing trait data."
https://openalex.org/W2280407716,"The Wnt/β-catenin pathway has important roles in chemoresistance and multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression in some cancers, but its involvement in breast cancer and the underlying molecular mechanism are undefined. In this study, we demonstrated that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is activated in chemoresistant breast cancer cells. Using a Wnt pathway-specific PCR array screening assay, we detected that Pygo2, a newly identified Wnt/β-catenin pathway component, was the most upregulated gene in the resistant cells. Additional experiments indicated that Pygo2 activated MDR1 expression in the resistant cells via the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Moreover, the inhibition of Pygo2 expression restored the chemotherapeutic drug sensitivity of the resistant cells and reduced the breast cancer stem cell population in these cells in response to chemotherapy. Importantly, these activities induced by Pygo2 were mediated by MDR1. We also determined the effect of Pygo2 on the sensitivity of breast tumors resistant to doxorubicin in a mouse model. Finally, RNA samples from 64 paired patient tumors (before and after chemotherapy) highly and significantly overexpressed Pygo2 and/or MDR1 after treatment, thus underlining a pivotal role for the Pygo2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the clinical chemoresistance of breast cancer. Our data represent the first implication of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in breast cancer chemoresistance and identify potential new targets to treat the recurrence of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2263369639,"Neurons in visual cortex are connected not only locally, but also through networks of distal connectivity. These distal networks recruit both excitatory and inhibitory synapses and result in divisive normalization. Normalization is traditionally thought to result from increases in synaptic inhibition. By combining optogenetic stimulation and intracellular recordings in mouse visual cortex, we found that, on the contrary, normalization is a result of a decrease in synaptic excitation."

https://openalex.org/W2284405698,"Activating KRAS mutations are found in approximately 20% of human cancers but no RAS-directed therapies are currently available. Here we describe a novel, robust, KRAS synthetic lethal interaction with the cyclin dependent kinase, CDK1. This was discovered using parallel siRNA screens in KRAS mutant and wild type colorectal isogenic tumour cells and subsequently validated in a genetically diverse panel of 26 colorectal and pancreatic tumour cell models. This established that the KRAS/CDK1 synthetic lethality applies in tumour cells with either amino acid position 12 (p.G12V, pG12D, p.G12S) or amino acid position 13 (p.G13D) KRAS mutations and can also be replicated in vivo in a xenograft model using a small molecule CDK1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, CDK1 inhibition caused a reduction in the S-phase fraction of KRAS mutant cells, an effect also characterised by modulation of Rb, a master control of the G1/S checkpoint. Taken together, these observations suggest that the KRAS/CDK1 interaction is a robust synthetic lethal effect worthy of further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2285950721,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients have a poor prognosis, with invasion and metastasis as major causes of mortality. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway regulates a wide range of cellular processes crucial for tumorigenesis, and PIK3CA amplification and mutation are among the most common genetic alterations in human HNSCC. Compared with the well-documented roles of the PI3K pathway in cell growth and survival, the roles of the PI3K pathway in tumor invasion and metastasis have not been well delineated. We generated a PIK3CA genetically engineered mouse model (PIK3CA-GEMM) in which wild-type PIK3CA is overexpressed in head and neck epithelium. Although PIK3CA overexpression alone was not sufficient to initiate HNSCC formation, it significantly increased tumor susceptibility in an oral carcinogenesis mouse model. PIK3CA overexpression in mouse oral epithelium increased tumor invasiveness and metastasis by increasing epithelial-mesenchymal transition and by enriching a cancer stem cell phenotype in tumor epithelial cells. In addition to these epithelial alterations, we also observed marked inflammation in tumor stroma. AKT is a central signaling mediator of the PI3K pathway. However, molecular analysis suggested that progression of PIK3CA-driven HNSCC is facilitated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase (PDK1) and enhanced transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling rather than by AKT. Examination of human HNSCC clinical samples revealed that both PIK3CA and PDK1 protein levels correlated with tumor progression, highlighting the significance of this pathway. In summary, our results offer significant insight into how PIK3CA overexpression drives HNSCC invasion and metastasis, providing a rationale for targeting PI3K/PDK1 and TGFβ signaling in advanced HNSCC patients with PIK3CA amplification."
https://openalex.org/W2283277868,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients frequently results in tumor resistance to treatment. Autophagy is an emerging underlying resistance mechanism, however, the molecular autophagy machinery in HNSCC cells and potential biomarkers of patient response to EGFR-targeted therapy remain insufficiently characterized. Here we show that the EGFR blocking with cetuximab leads to varied autophagic responses, which modulate cancer cell susceptibility to EGFR inhibition. Inhibition of autophagy sensitizes HNSCC cells to EGFR blockade. Importantly, we identify a novel signaling hub centering on the NLRX1 (nucleotide-binding, lots of leucine-rich repeats-containing protein member X1)–TUFM (Tu translation elongation factor mitochondrial) protein complex, promoting autophagic flux. Defects in the expression of either NLRX1 or TUFM result in compromised autophagy when treated with EGFR inhibitors. As a previously undefined autophagy-promoting mechanism, we found that TUFM serves as a novel anchorage site, recruiting Beclin-1 to mitochondria, promoting its polyubiquitination, and interfering with its interaction with Rubicon. This protein complex is also essential for endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling induction, possibly as an additional mechanism to promote autophagy. Utilizing tumor specimens from a novel neoadjuvant clinical trial, we show that increased expression of the autophagy adaptor protein, SQSTM1/p62, is associated with poor response to cetuximab therapy. These findings expand our understanding of the components involved in HNSCC autophagy machinery that responds to EGFR inhibitors, and suggest potential combinatorial approaches to enhance its therapeutic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2288159573,YihQ hydrolyzes the glycosidic linkage in sulfoquinovosyl diacylglyceride (SQDG) to form sulfoquinovose (SQ). Crystal structure analysis reveals active site residues required for the specificity of YihQ for SQ and allows the identification of other YihQ homologs. Sulfoquinovose is produced by photosynthetic organisms at a rate of 1010 tons per annum and is degraded by bacteria as a source of carbon and sulfur. We have identified Escherichia coli YihQ as the first dedicated sulfoquinovosidase and the gateway enzyme to sulfoglycolytic pathways. Structural and mutagenesis studies unveiled the sequence signatures for binding the distinguishing sulfonate residue and revealed that sulfoquinovoside degradation is widespread across the tree of life.
https://openalex.org/W2258423024,"Lumican, an extracellular matrix proteoglycan overexpressed by pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDACs), drives the formation of a tumor-specific microenvironment. We recently showed that extracellular lumican inhibits pancreatic cancer cell growth and is associated with prolonged survival after surgery. Here we investigated the role of extracellular lumican in chemotherapy-mediated cancer therapy. Lumican secretion was increased by chemotherapeutic agents in PDAC, and especially in PSCs, and appeared to be linked to the extent of cells’ response to chemotherapy-induced growth inhibition. In multiple PDAC models, including cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and lumican knockout mice, lumican significantly increased antitumor effect of chemotherapy. This effect was associated with DNA damage, apoptosis and inhibition of cell viability, glucose consumption, lactate production and vascular endothelial growth factor secretion. In PDAC cells, chemotherapeutic agents triggered autophagosome formation and increased LC3 expression through the reactive oxygen species-mediated AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway. Inhibition of gemcitabine-induced autophagy in cancer cells by treatment with AMPK inhibitor compound C, lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine or autophagy inhibitor 3MA enhanced gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, suggesting that autophagy is a protective cellular response to gemcitabine treatment. Importantly, lumican dramatically decreased AMPK activity, inhibiting chemotherapy-induced autophagy in both in vitro and in vivo PDAC models. Co-treatment of PDAC cells with lumican and gemcitabine increased mitochondrial damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and cytochrome c release, indicating that lumican-induced disruption of mitochondrial function may be the mechanism of sensitization to gemcitabine. Together, our findings demonstrate that extracellular lumican augments cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in PDAC cells through inhibition of chemotherapeutic agent-induced autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2281236506,"Allostery provides a critical control over enzyme activity, biasing the catalytic site between inactive and active states. We found that the Ciona intestinalis voltage-sensing phosphatase (Ci-VSP), which modifies phosphoinositide signaling lipids (PIPs), has not one but two sequential active states with distinct substrate specificities, whose occupancy is allosterically controlled by sequential conformations of the voltage-sensing domain (VSD). Using fast fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) reporters of PIPs to monitor enzyme activity and voltage-clamp fluorometry to monitor conformational changes in the VSD, we found that Ci-VSP switches from inactive to a PIP3-preferring active state when the VSD undergoes an initial voltage-sensing motion and then into a second PIP2-preferring active state when the VSD activates fully. This two-step allosteric control over a dual-specificity enzyme enables voltage to shape PIP concentrations in time, and provides a mechanism for the complex modulation of PIP-regulated ion channels, transporters, cell motility, endocytosis and exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2281668612,"Cell invasion and migration significantly contribute to tumor metastasis. Microtubule-associated protein 4 (MAP4) protein is one member of microtubule-associate proteins family. It is responsible for stabilization of microtubules by modulation of microtubule dynamics. However, there is little information about the involvement of MAP4 in human cancer. Here we show that MAP4 serves as a regulator of invasion and migration in esophageal squamous cancer cells. By activating the ERK-c-Jun-vascular endothelial growth factor A signaling pathway, MAP4 promotes cell invasion and migration in vitro, tumor growth and metastasis in mouse models. Immunohistochemical staining of operative tissues indicated that MAP4 expression was associated with tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and shorter survival of the patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that MAP4 is an independent prognostic indicator. In the serial sections of ESCC tissues, there was a positive correlation between MAP4 and vascular endothelial growth factor A expression. Notably, an intratumoral injection of MAP4-small interfering RNA (siRNA) remarkably inhibited the growth of the tumors that formed by the MAP4-expressing ESCC cells in nude mice, and a combination of MAP4-siRNA and Bevacizumab significantly enhanced the inhibition effect. Our data suggest that MAP4 is probably a useful prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic target for the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2439808371,"Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/Met signaling has critical roles in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) development and progression and is considered a potential therapeutic target for this disease. However, the mechanism of aberrant activation of HGF/Met signaling and resistance to Met inhibition in PDA remains unclear. The mechanistic role of cross talk between Forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and HGF/Met signaling in promotion of PDA growth and resistance to Met inhibition was examined using cell culture, molecular biology and mouse models; and the relevance of our experimental and mechanistic findings were validated using human PDA tissues. Met was markedly overexpressed in both PDA cell lines and pancreatic tumor specimens, and the expression of Met correlated directly with that of FOXM1 in human tumor specimens. Mechanistically, FOXM1 bound to the promoter region of the Met gene and transcriptionally increased the expression of Met. Increased expression of FOXM1 enhanced the activation of HGF/Met signaling and its downstream pathways, including retrovirus-associated DNA sequences/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. Furthermore, activation of HGF/Met signaling increased the expression and transcriptional activity of FOXM1, and the cross talk between FOXM1 and HGF/Met signaling promoted PDA growth and resistance to Met inhibition. Collectively, our findings identified a positive feedback loop formed by FOXM1 and HGF/Met and revealed that this loop is a potentially effective therapeutic target for PDA."

To determine location-based differences in CVD risk factors in India we performed studies among women in rural, urban-poor and urban middle-class locations. Methods Population-based cross-sectional studies in rural, urban-poor, and urban-middle class women (35–70y) were performed at multiple sites. We evaluated 6853 women (rural 2616, 5 sites; urban-poor 2008, 4 sites; urban middle-class 2229, 11 sites) for socioeconomic, lifestyle, anthropometric and biochemical risk factors. Descriptive statistics are reported. Results Mean levels of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), systolic BP, fasting glucose and cholesterol in rural, urban-poor and urban-middle class women showed significantly increasing trends (ANOVAtrend, p <0.001). Age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes and risk factors among rural, urban-poor and urban-middle class women, respectively was, diabetes (2.2, 9.3, 17.7%), overweight BMI ≥25 kg/m2 (22.5, 45.6, 57.4%), waist >80 cm (28.3, 63.4, 61.9%), waist >90 cm (8.4, 31.4, 38.2%), waist hip ratio (WHR) >0.8 (60.4, 90.7, 88.5), WHR>0.9 (13.0, 44.3, 56.1%), hypertension (31.6, 48.2, 59.0%) and hypercholesterolemia (13.5, 27.7, 37.4%) (Mantel Haenszel X2 ptrend <0.01). Inverse trend was observed for tobacco use (41.6, 19.6, 9.4%). There was significant association of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes with overweight and obesity (adjusted R2 0.89–0.99). Conclusions There are significant location based differences in cardiometabolic risk factors in India. The urban-middle class women have the highest risk compared to urban-poor and rural."
https://openalex.org/W2418866554,"The SET protein is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Here, we report the oncogenic role of SET in hepatocarcinogenesis, clinical aggressiveness and anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapeutics. By analyzing samples obtained from 147 HCC patients, we found that SET overexpression was detected specifically in 30.6% HCC tumor samples, and was significantly associated with worse clinical features and high p-Akt expression in HCC tumors. Co-expression of SET and Akt predicted shorter post-operative recurrence-free survival in this cohort (P=0.045). Furthermore, SET was significantly associated with cell growth and hepatosphere formation. To elucidate the anti-HCC potential of targeting SET, we generated a novel SET antagonist, EMQA (N(4)-(3-ethynylphenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-N(2)-(4-phenoxyphenyl) quinazoline-2,4-diamine). EMQA enhanced PP2A activity via disrupting SET-PP2Ac (catalytic domain of PP2A) binding in HCC cells, which restored PP2A-mediated p-Akt downregulation and promoted HCC cell death. In HCC cells or recombinant proteins expressing the N- and C- truncated forms of SET, only the C-terminal SET was required for EMQA targeting. Furthermore, combining sorafenib and EMQA showed good synergism in inhibiting HCC survival. Our findings suggested the oncogenic role of SET and the adverse prognostic value of SET overexpression in HCC. This alteration defines a subgroup of HCC patients who could benefit from SET antagonists, such as EMQA."
https://openalex.org/W2281110192,"Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step in glycolysis and is allosterically regulated to control flux through the pathway. Two models are proposed to explain how Escherichia coli pyruvate kinase type 1 is allosterically regulated: the rotation suggests that both the domains within the monomer and the monomers within the tetramer reorient with respect to one another; the body reorientation proposes only a reorientation of the monomers within the tetramer causing rigidification of the active site. To test these hypotheses and elucidate the conformational and dynamic changes that drive allostery, we performed time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry coupled to hydrogen-deuterium exchange studies followed by mutagenic analysis to test the activation mechanism. Global exchange experiments, supported by thermostability studies, demonstrate that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate binding to the allosteric domain causes a shift toward a globally more dynamic ensemble of conformations. Mapping deuterium exchange to peptides within the enzyme highlight site-specific regions with altered conformational dynamics, many of which increase in conformational flexibility. Based upon these and mutagenic studies, we propose an allosteric mechanism whereby the binding of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate destabilizes an α-helix that bridges the allosteric and active site domains within the monomeric unit. This destabilizes the β-strands within the (β/α)8-barrel domain and the linked active site loops that are responsible for substrate binding. Our data are consistent with the domain rotation model but inconsistent with the rigid body reorientation model given the increased flexibility at the interdomain interface, and we can for the first time explain how fructose 1,6-bisphosphate affects the active site."
https://openalex.org/W2279882281,"Targeted therapies using small-molecule inhibitors (SMIs) are commonly used in metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) patients; patients often develop drug resistance and eventually succumb to disease. Currently, understanding of mechanisms leading to SMIs resistance and any identifiable predictive marker(s) are still lacking. We discovered that DAB2IP, a novel Ras-GTPase-activating protein, was frequently epigenetically silenced in RCC, and DAB2IP loss was correlated with the overall survival of RCC patients. Loss of DAB2IP in RCC cells enhances their sensitivities to growth factor stimulation and resistances to SMI (such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors). Mechanistically, loss of DAB2IP results in the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase/RSK1 and phosphoinositide-3 kinase/mTOR pathway, which synergizes the induction of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α expression. Consequently, elevated HIF-2α suppresses p21/WAF1 expression that is associated with resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Thus combinatorial targeting both pathways resulted in a synergistic tumor inhibition. DAB2IP appears to be a new prognostic/predictive marker for mRCC patients, and its function provides a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance to mTOR inhibitors, which also can be used to develop new strategies to overcome drug-resistant mRCC."

https://openalex.org/W2288108679,"External validation studies are essential to study the generalizability of prediction models. Recently a permutation test, focusing on discrimination as quantified by the c-statistic, was proposed to judge whether a prediction model is transportable to a new setting. We aimed to evaluate this test and compare it to previously proposed procedures to judge any changes in c-statistic from development to external validation setting.We compared the use of the permutation test to the use of benchmark values of the c-statistic following from a previously proposed framework to judge transportability of a prediction model. In a simulation study we developed a prediction model with logistic regression on a development set and validated them in the validation set. We concentrated on two scenarios: 1) the case-mix was more heterogeneous and predictor effects were weaker in the validation set compared to the development set, and 2) the case-mix was less heterogeneous in the validation set and predictor effects were identical in the validation and development set. Furthermore we illustrated the methods in a case study using 15 datasets of patients suffering from traumatic brain injury.The permutation test indicated that the validation and development set were homogenous in scenario 1 (in almost all simulated samples) and heterogeneous in scenario 2 (in 17%-39% of simulated samples). Previously proposed benchmark values of the c-statistic and the standard deviation of the linear predictors correctly pointed at the more heterogeneous case-mix in scenario 1 and the less heterogeneous case-mix in scenario 2.The recently proposed permutation test may provide misleading results when externally validating prediction models in the presence of case-mix differences between the development and validation population. To correctly interpret the c-statistic found at external validation it is crucial to disentangle case-mix differences from incorrect regression coefficients."
https://openalex.org/W2274026040,"Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) expression is downregulated in breast cancer, including invasive ductal carcinoma compared with ductal breast carcinoma in situ and metastatic breast tumors. However, little is known about how loss of MLCK expression contributes to tumor progression. MLCK is a component of the actin cytoskeleton and its known role is the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain of myosin II. To gain insights into the role of MLCK in breast cancer, we perturbed its function using small interfering RNA (siRNA) or pharmacological inhibition in untransformed breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). Loss of MLCK by siRNAs led to increased cell migration and invasion, disruption of cell-cell adhesions and enhanced formation of focal adhesions at the leading edge of migratory cells. In addition, downregulation of MLCK cooperated with HER2 in MCF10A cells to promote cell migration and invasion and low levels of MLCK is associated with a poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Associated with these altered migratory behaviors were increased expression of epidermal growth factor receptor and activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways in MLCK downregulated MCF10A cells. By contrast, inhibition of the kinase function of MLCK using pharmacological agents inhibited cell migration and invasion, and did not affect cellular adhesions. Our results show that loss of MLCK contributes to the migratory properties of epithelial cells resulting from changes in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions, and increased epidermal growth factor receptor signaling. These findings suggest that decreased expression of MLCK may have a critical role during tumor progression by facilitating the metastatic potential of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2282834606,"Intracranial hemorrhage remains the most feared complication in tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) thrombolysis for ischemic stroke. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly elucidated. In this study, we reported an important role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) s-nitrosylation in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and 9 secretion from tPA-treated ischemic endothelial cells. Brain vascular endothelial cells (bEND3) were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) for 2 h before adding recombinant human tPA for 6 h. This treatment induced a significant increase of MMP2 and 9 in the media of bEND3 cells and a simultaneous degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1, the two main components of extracellular matrix (ECM). Inhibition of MMP2 and 9 with SB-3CT completely blocked the degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1. ODG+tPA treatment led to Cav-1 shedding from bEND3 cells into the media. Notably, OGD triggered nitric oxide (NO) production and S-nitrosylationof Cav-1 (SNCav-1). Meanwhile tPA induced activation of ERK signal pathway and stimulates the secretion of SNCav-1. Pretreatment of bEND3 cells with C-PTIO (a NO scavenger) or U0126 (a specific ERK inhibitor) significantly reduced OGD-induced S-nitrosylation of Cav-1 in cells and blocked the secretion of Cav-1 and MMP2 and 9 into the media as well as the degradation of fibronectin and laminin β-1 in OGD and tPA-treated cells. These data indicate that OGD-triggered Cav-1 S-nitrosylation interacts with tPA-induced ERK activation to augment MMP2 and 9 secretion and subsequent ECM degradation, which may account for the exacerbation of ischemic blood brain barrier damage following tPA thrombolysis for ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2275085442,"Caregivers of HIV-positive children were interviewed in the Mbarara and Isingiro districts of Uganda to identify current trends in practices related to HIV testing and the disclosure of HIV status to the child. A total of 28 caregivers of at least one HIV-positive child participated in semi-structured interviews exploring when and why they tested the child for HIV, when the child was informed of their positive status, and what the caregiver did to prepare themselves and the child for status disclosure. For a majority (96%) of respondents, the decision to test the child for HIV was due to existing illness in either the child or a relative. Other common themes identified included the existence of stigma in the caregivers’ communities and doubt that the children truly understood what was being explained to them when their status was disclosed. Most (65%) children were informed of their HIV status between the ages of 5 and 9, with the mean age of disclosure occurring at the age of 7. General provision of HIV information typically began at the same age as disclosure, and as many as two thirds (64%) of the caregivers sought advice from an HIV counsellor prior to disclosure. How a caregiver chose to prepare themselves and the child did not affect the caregiver’s perception of whether the disclosure experience was beneficial or not. These findings suggest that the HIV disclosure experience in Mbarara and Isingiro districts differs from current guidelines, especially with respect to age of disclosure, how caregivers prepare themselves and the child, and approaching disclosure as an ongoing process. The doubts expressed by caregivers regarding the child’s level of HIV understanding following the disclosure experience suggest the children may be insufficiently prepared at the time of the initial disclosure event. The findings also suggest that examining the content of pre-disclosure counselling and HIV education, and how health care professionals are trained to facilitate the disclosure process as important avenues for further research."
https://openalex.org/W2275164090,"The Caatinga is a semi-arid biome in northeast Brazil. The Paraguaçú River is located in the Caatinga biome, and part of its course is protected by the National Park of Chapada Diamantina (PNCD). In this study we evaluated the effect of PNCD protection on the water quality and microbial community diversity of this river by analyzing water samples obtained from points located inside and outside the PNCD in both wet and dry seasons. Results of water quality analysis showed higher levels of silicate, ammonia, particulate organic carbon, and nitrite in samples from the unprotected area compared with those from protected areas. Pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA genes revealed that Burkholderiales was abundant in samples from all three sites during both seasons and was represented primarily by the genus Polynucleobacter and members of the Comamonadaceae family (e.g., genus Limnohabitans). During the dry season, the unprotected area showed a higher abundance of Flavobacterium sp. and Arthrobacter sp., which are frequently associated with the presence and/or degradation of arsenic and pesticide compounds. In addition, genes that appear to be related to agricultural impacts on the environment, as well as those involved in arsenic and cadmium resistance, copper homeostasis, and propanediol utilization, were detected in the unprotected areas by metagenomic sequencing. Although PNCD protection improves water quality, agricultural activities around the park may affect water quality within the park and may account for the presence of bacteria capable of pesticide degradation and assimilation, evidencing possible anthropogenic impacts on the Caatinga."
https://openalex.org/W2278604525,"The presence of invasion into the extra-hepatic portion of the portal vein or the development of distant metastases renders hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients ineligible for the only potential curative options for this malignancy-tumor resection or organ transplantation. Gene expression profiling of murine HCC cell lines identified KLF6 as a potential regulator of HCC cell migration. KLF6 knockdown increases cell migration, consistent with the correlation between decreased KLF6 mRNA levels and the presence of vascular invasion in human HCC. Concordantly, single-copy deletion of Klf6 in a HCC mouse model results in increased tumor formation, increased metastasis to the lungs and decreased survival, indicating that KLF6 suppresses both HCC development and metastasis. By combining gene expression profiling and chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to deep sequencing, we identified novel transcriptional targets of KLF6 in HCC cells including VAV3, a known activator of the RAC1 small GTPase. Indeed, RAC1 activity is increased in KLF6-knockdown cells in a VAV3-dependent manner, and knockdown of either RAC1 or VAV3 impairs HCC cell migration. Together, our data demonstrate a novel function for KLF6 in constraining HCC dissemination through the regulation of a VAV3-RAC1 signaling axis."
https://openalex.org/W2281495395,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome, has become one of the most common causes of chronic liver disease over the last decade in developed countries. NAFLD includes a spectrum of pathological hepatic changes, such as steatosis, steatohepatitis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) is polyphenolic compounds with a diarylheptanoid skeleton, curcumin close analogues, which is derived from the Curcumae Longae Rhizoma. While the rich bioavailability research of curcumin, BDMC is the poor studies. We investigated whether BDMC has the hepatoprotective effect and combinatory preventive effect with silymarin on methionine choline deficient (MCD)-diet-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups of normal (normal diet without any treatment), MCD diet (MCD diet only), MCD + silymarin (SIL) 100 mg/kg group, MCD + BDMC 100 mg/kg group, MCD + SIL 50 mg/kg + BDMC 50 mg/kg group. Body weight, liver weight, liver function tests, histological changes were assessed and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were conducted after 4 weeks. Mice lost body weight on the MCD-diet, but BDMC did not lose less than the MCD-diet group. Liver weights decreased from BDMC, but they increased significantly in the MCD-diet groups. All liver function test values decreased from the MCD-diet, whereas those from the BDMC increased significantly. The MCD- diet induced severe hepatic fatty accumulation, but the fatty change was reduced in the BDMC. The BDMC showed an inhibitory effect on liver lipogenesis by reducing associated gene expression caused by the MCD-diet. In all experiments, the combinations of BDMC with SIL had a synergistic effect against MCD-diet models. In conclusion, our findings indicate that BDMC has a potential suppressive effect on NAFLD. Therefore, our data suggest that BDMC may act as a novel and potent therapeutic agent against NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2273939311,"A chimeric protein vaccine composed of the cholera toxin B subunit fused to proinsulin (CTB-INS) was shown to suppress type 1 diabetes onset in NOD mice and upregulate biosynthesis of the tryptophan catabolic enzyme indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO1) in human dendritic cells (DCs). Here we demonstrate siRNA inhibition of the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) suppresses vaccine-induced IDO1 biosynthesis as well as IKKα phosphorylation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of CTB-INS inoculated DCs showed that RelB bound to NF-κB consensus sequences in the IDO1 promoter, suggesting vaccine stimulation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway activates IDO1 expression in vivo. The addition of Tumor Necrosis Factor Associated Factors (TRAF) TRAF 2, 3 and TRAF6 blocking peptides to vaccine inoculated DCs was shown to inhibit IDO1 biosynthesis. This experimental outcome suggests vaccine activation of the TNFR super-family receptor pathway leads to upregulation of IDO1 biosynthesis in CTB-INS inoculated dendritic cells. Together, our experimental data suggest the CTB-INS vaccine uses a TNFR-dependent signaling pathway of the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathway resulting in suppression of dendritic cell mediated type 1 diabetes autoimmunity."
https://openalex.org/W2288178577,"Considering the entire life history of a species is fundamental to developing effective conservation strategies. Decreasing populations of five-needle white pines may be leading to the decline of Clark’s nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana). These birds are important seed dispersers for at least ten conifer species in the western U.S., including whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), an obligate mutualist of Clark’s nutcrackers. For effective conservation of both Clark’s nutcrackers and whitebark pine, it is essential to ensure stability of Clark’s nutcracker populations. My objectives were to examine Clark’s nutcracker breeding season home range size, territoriality, habitat selection, and foraging behavior in the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a region where whitebark pine is declining. I radio-tracked Clark’s nutcrackers in 2011, a population-wide nonbreeding year following a low whitebark pine cone crop, and 2012, a breeding year following a high cone crop. Results suggest Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) communities are important habitat for Clark’s nutcrackers because they selected it for home ranges. In contrast, they did not select whitebark pine habitat. However, Clark’s nutcrackers did adjust their use of whitebark pine habitat between years, suggesting that, in some springs, whitebark pine habitat may be used more than previously expected. Newly extracted Douglas-fir seeds were an important food source both years. On the other hand, cached seeds made up a relatively lower proportion of the diet in 2011, suggesting cached seeds are not a reliable spring food source. Land managers focus on restoring whitebark pine habitat with the assumption that Clark’s nutcrackers will be available to continue seed dispersal. In the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Clark’s nutcracker populations may be more likely to be retained year-round when whitebark pine restoration efforts are located adjacent to Douglas-fir habitat. By extrapolation, whitebark pine restoration efforts in other regions may consider prioritizing restoration of whitebark pine stands near alternative seed sources."
https://openalex.org/W2278698827,"Rad54 and Mus81 mammalian proteins physically interact and are important for the homologous recombination DNA repair pathway; however, their functional interactions in vivo are poorly defined. Here, we show that combinatorial loss of Rad54 and Mus81 results in hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, defects on both the homologous recombination and non-homologous DNA end joining repair pathways and reduced fertility. We also observed that while Mus81 deficiency diminished the cleavage of common fragile sites, very strikingly, Rad54 loss impaired this cleavage to even a greater extent. The inefficient repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in Rad54−/−Mus81−/− cells was accompanied by elevated levels of chromosome missegregation and cell death. Perhaps as a consequence, tumor incidence in Rad54−/−Mus81−/− mice remained comparable to that in Mus81−/− mice. Our study highlights the importance of the cooperation between Rad54 and Mus81 for mediating DNA DSB repair and restraining chromosome missegregation."
https://openalex.org/W2287299626,"Previous studies indicate that, in addition to the blood glucose level, the lipid level in the blood may affect functions of pancreatic beta cells. In this study, we aimed to examine whether there was a relationship between the serum level of total cholesterol (TC) and the insulin secretory capacity in healthy subjects.In participants of health examinations conducted from 2006 to 2010, we analyzed data from a total of 2,499 subjects (1,057 men and 1,442 women) after exclusion of individuals with dyslipidemia, thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, HbA1c≥6.5%, or fasting blood glucose≥126 mg/dL. Homeostasis model assessment for beta cell function (HOMA-beta) was utilized as a model representing the pancreatic beta cell function.Although the serum TC level had a positive correlation with HOMA-beta in a univariate correlation analysis, after adjustment by confounding factors in a multiple regression analysis, HOMA-beta had a negative correlation with TC. This was further confirmed in a multiple logistic regression analysis, showing that higher TC was an independent risk factor for decreased insulin secretory capacity (defined as HOMA-beta≤30%) together with higher age, lower BMI, lower TG, male sex and regular alcohol intake. After the participants were stratified by BMI into three groups, the effect of TC on HOMA-beta increased along with the increase in BMI, and it was highly significant in the highest tertile.This cross-sectional study indicated that increased serum TC level might be related to the decrease of insulin secretory capacity in aged healthy population and that reduction of TC is more necessary in obese subjects to prevent diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2286840149,"The Developmental Eye Movement (DEM) test is commonly used as a clinical visual-verbal ocular motor assessment tool to screen and diagnose reading problems at the onset. No established norm exists for using the DEM test with Mandarin Chinese-speaking Chinese children. This study aims to establish the normative values of the DEM test for the Mandarin Chinese-speaking population in China; it also aims to compare the values with three other published norms for English-, Spanish-, and Cantonese-speaking Chinese children. A random stratified sampling method was used to recruit children from eight kindergartens and eight primary schools in the main urban and suburban areas of Nanjing. A total of 1,425 Mandarin Chinese-speaking children aged 5 to 12 years took the DEM test in Mandarin Chinese. A digital recorder was used to record the process. All of the subjects completed a symptomatology survey, and their DEM scores were determined by a trained tester. The scores were computed using the formula in the DEM manual, except that the “vertical scores” were adjusted by taking the vertical errors into consideration. The results were compared with the three other published norms. In our subjects, a general decrease with age was observed for the four eye movement indexes: vertical score, adjusted horizontal score, ratio, and total error. For both the vertical and adjusted horizontal scores, the Mandarin Chinese-speaking children completed the tests much more quickly than the norms for English- and Spanish-speaking children. However, the same group completed the test slightly more slowly than the norms for Cantonese-speaking children. The differences in the means were significant (P<0.001) in all age groups. For several ages, the scores obtained in this study were significantly different from the reported scores of Cantonese-speaking Chinese children (P<0.005). Compared with English-speaking children, only the vertical score of the 6-year-old group, the vertical-horizontal time ratio of the 8-year-old group and the errors of 9-year-old group had no significant difference (P>0.05); compared with Spanish-speaking children, the scores were statistically significant (P<0.001) for the total error scores of the age groups, except the 6-, 9-, 10-, and 11-year-old age groups (P>0.05). DEM norms may be affected by differences in language, cultural, and educational systems among various ethnicities. The norms of the DEM test are proposed for use with Mandarin Chinese-speaking children in Nanjing and will be proposed for children throughout China."
https://openalex.org/W2283472838,"Atherosclerosis is among the leading causes of death and disability. Combining information from multi-modal vascular images is an effective and efficient way to diagnose and monitor atherosclerosis, in which image registration is a key technique. In this paper a feature-based registration algorithm, Two-step Auto-labeling Conditional Iterative Closed Points (TACICP) algorithm, is proposed to align three-dimensional carotid image datasets from ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR). Based on 2D segmented contours, a coarse-to-fine strategy is employed with two steps: rigid initialization step and non-rigid refinement step. Conditional Iterative Closest Points (CICP) algorithm is given in rigid initialization step to obtain the robust rigid transformation and label configurations. Then the labels and CICP algorithm with non-rigid thin-plate-spline (TPS) transformation model is introduced to solve non-rigid carotid deformation between different body positions. The results demonstrate that proposed TACICP algorithm has achieved an average registration error of less than 0.2mm with no failure case, which is superior to the state-of-the-art feature-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W2278902294,"Regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential for T cell homeostasis and maintenance of peripheral tolerance. They prevent activation of auto-reactive T effector cells (Teff) in the context of autoimmunity and allergy. Otherwise, Treg also inhibit effective immune responses against tumors. Besides a number of Treg-associated molecules such as Foxp3, CTLA-4 or GARP, known to play critical roles in Treg differentiation, activation and function, the involvement of additional regulatory elements is suggested. Herein, kinase activities seem to play an important role in Treg fine tuning. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the complex intracellular signaling pathways controlling phenotype and function of Treg is still limited and based on single kinase cascades so far. To gain a more comprehensive insight into the pathways determining Treg function we performed kinome profiling using a phosphorylation-based kinome array in human Treg at different activation stages compared to Teff. Here we have determined intriguing quantitative differences in both populations. Resting and activated Treg showed an altered pattern of CD28-dependent kinases as well as of those involved in cell cycle progression. Additionally, significant up-regulation of distinct kinases such as EGFR or CK2 in activated Treg but not in Teff not only resemble data we obtained in previous studies in the murine system but also suggest that those specific molecular activation patterns can be used for definition of the activation and functional state of human Treg. Taken together, detailed investigation of kinome profiles opens the possibility to identify novel molecular mechanisms for a better understanding of Treg biology but also for development of effective immunotherapies against unwanted T cell responses in allergy, autoimmunity and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2282128026,"We edited, redrew, and evaluated four unpublished historical vegetation maps of the Western Pamirs (Tajikistan) by the Soviet geobotanist Okmir E. Agakhanjanz. These maps cover an area of 5,188 km2 and date from 1958 to 1960. The purpose of this article is to make the historic vegetation data available to the scientific community and thus preserve a hitherto non available and up to now neglected or forgotten data source with great potential for studies on vegetation and ecosystem response to global change. The original hand-drawn maps were scanned, georeferenced, and digitized and the corresponding land cover class was assigned to each polygon. The partly differing legends were harmonized and plant names updated. Furthermore, a digital elevation model and generalized additive models were used to calculate response curves of the land cover classes and to explore vegetation-topography relationships quantitatively. In total, 2,216 polygons belonging to 13 major land cover classes were included that are characterized by 252 different plant species. As such, the presented maps provide excellent comparison data for studies on vegetation and ecosystem change in an area that is deemed to be an important water tower in Central Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2275587848,"Refraction in the peripheral visual field is believed to play an important role in the development of myopia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in peripheral refraction among anisomyopia, isomyopia, and isoemmetropia for schoolchildren.Thirty-eight anisomyopic children were recruited and divided into two groups: (1) both eyes were myopic (anisomyopic group, AM group) and (2) one eye was myopic and the contralateral eye was emmetropic (emmetropic anisomyopic group, EAM group). As controls, 45 isomyopic and isoemmetropic children were also recruited with age and central spherical equivalent (SE) matched to those of the AM and EAM groups. The controls were divided into three groups: (1) intermediate myopia group (SE matched to the more myopic eye of AM group), (2) low myopia group (SE matched to the less myopic eye of AM group and the more myopic eye of EAM group), and (3) emmetropia group (SE matched to the less myopic eye of EAM group). Peripheral refraction at 7 points across the central ±30° on the horizontal visual field with a 10° interval was measured with an autorefractor. Axial length (AL), corneal curvature (CC), and anterior chamber depth (ACD) were also determined by using the Zeiss IOL-Master.The relative peripheral spherical equivalent [RPR(M)] and relative peripheral spherical value [RPR(S)] of the more myopic eye was shifted more hyperopically than the contralateral eye in both the AM and the EAM groups (both p<0.0001). The RPR(M, S) of the less myopic eyes in the AM and EAM groups showed a relatively flat trend across the visual field and were not significantly different from the emmetropia group. The RPR(M, S) of less myopic eyes in the AM group were shifted less hyperopically than in the isomyopic low myopia group and the more myopic eye of the EAM group [RPR(M), p = 0.007; RPR(S), p = 0.001], although the central SEs of the three groups were not significantly different from each other. However, RPR(M, S) of the more myopic eyes were not different from the corresponding isomyopic groups. There was also no significant difference in the relative peripheral astigmatism [RPR(J0, J45)] between the more and the less myopic eyes in either the AM or the EAM group.Refraction of anisomyopia differs between the two eyes not only at the central visual field but also at the off-axis periphery. The relative peripheral refraction of the more myopic eye of anisomyopia was shifted hyperopically, as occurs in isomyopia with similar central subjective SE values. Less myopic eyes were much less hyperopically shifted in relative peripheral refraction than the corresponding isomyopic eyes, but are comparable to emmetropic eyes. This emmetropia-like relative peripheral refraction in less myopic eyes might be a factor responsible for slowing down the progression of myopia."
https://openalex.org/W2275712225,"Branch roads, which are densely distributed in cities, allow for the flow of local traffic and provide connections between the city and outlying areas. Branch roads are typically narrow, and two-way traffic flows on branch roads are thus affected when vehicles traveling in opposite directions meet. This study investigates the changes in the velocities of vehicles when they meet on two-way branch roads. Various widths of branch roads were selected, and their influence on traffic flows was investigated via a video survey. The results show that, depending on the average vehicle velocity, branch roads require different widths to prevent a large decrease in velocity when vehicles meet. When the velocity on a branch road is not high (e.g., the average velocity without meeting is approximately 6 m/s), appropriately increasing the road width will notably increase the meeting velocity. However, when the velocity is high (e.g., the average velocity without meeting is greater than 10 m/s), there is a large decrease in velocity when meeting even if the road surface is wide (6.5 m). This study provides a basis for selecting the width of urban branch roads and the simulation of bidirectional traffic on such roads."
