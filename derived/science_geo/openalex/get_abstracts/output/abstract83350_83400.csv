https://openalex.org/W2061555550,"Direct microinjection of DNA by glass micropipettes was used to introduce the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene into cultured mammalian cells. When DNA was delivered directly into the nuclei of LMTK-, a mouse cell line deficient in thymidine kinase activity, 50--100% of the cells expressed TK enzymatic activity. In contrast, no TK activity could be detected when the DNA was injected into the cytoplasm. The number of injected LMTK- cells capable of indefinite growth in a TK+ selective medium (that is, transformants) depended on the nature of the plasmid DNA into which the HSV-TK gene was inserted. One cell in 500-1000 cells which received nuclear injections with pBR322/TK DNA gave rise to a viable colony when grown in HAT medium (that is, a TK+ selective medium). The transformation frequency increased to one in five injected cells when specific SV40 DNA sequences were also introduced into the HSV-TK plasmid. With the microinjection procedure transformation frequency was relatively insensitive to DNA concentration and did not depend on co-injecting with a carrier DNA. Most of the transformants were stable in nonselective medium as soon as they could be tested."

When intracellular electrophysiological recordings were obtained from the perfused retina-eyecup preparation of the mud-puppy (Necturus maculosus), the addition of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid to the bathing medium blocked all responses in the ON channel but left intact the OFF responses including OFF ganglion cell discharge. 2-Amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid blocks the light response of the ON bipolar cell by mimicking the endogenous photoreceptor transmitter."

https://openalex.org/W2081386962,"Nerve growth factor (NGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin, cholera toxin (CT) and cAMP all stimulate the phosphorylation of proteins in the PC12 nerve-like cell line. NGF, CT and cAMP enhance phosphorylation of the same set of proteins including tyrosine hydroxylase, ribosomal protein S6, histones H1 and H3, and the nonhistone chromosomal and cytoplasmic high mobility group (HMG) 17 protein, and reduce phosphorylation of H2A. EGF but not insulin enhances the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase. Insulin but not EGF enhances the phosphorylation of histone H3 and decreases the phosphorylation of H2A. EGFD and insulin each enhance phosphorylations of both ribosomal protein S6 and histone H1, but neither hormone induces phosphorylation of HMG 17. The extent of these effects depends upon the ligand concentration and is half-maximal at physiological concentrations of the hormones (beta-NGF, 2 ng/ml; EGF, 1 ng/ml. insulin, 0.5 microunits/ml). Maximal effects of NGF are seen within 15 min and persist even after 3 days of culture in the presence of NGF. When phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 is maximally stimulated by NGF, no further stimulation can be achieved by adding saturating quantities of either cAMP or CT. However, simultaneous addition of saturating quantities of NGF and either EGF or insulin results in an enhancement of phosphorylation that is equal to the sum of that achieved when the two ligands are added separately. These results suggest that the enhanced phosphorylation of S6 achieved by NGF or cAMP occurs through a common mechanism which differs from those which mediate EGF or insulin-enhanced phosphorylation. The data also provide strong evidence that the action of NGF included protein phosphorylation mediated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation of each of these proteins in response to NGF may play an important role in NGF action."
https://openalex.org/W2043198662,"Under physiological conditions the initial action of the RecBC enzyme (exonuclease V) on duplex DNA is unwinding of the DNA strands. We have examined by electron microscopy the initial products of this unwinding reaction. When such reactions are carried out in the presence of DNA binding protein, unwinding structures are seen both at the terminus of the duplex DNA and at locations remote from the ends of the DNA molecule. Both terminal and internal unwinding structures proceed along DNA at about 300 nucleotides per second, and the single-stranded loops in both types of structure enlarge at about 100 nucleotides per second. In the internal unwindings DNA must be rewound behind the enzyme at about 200 nucleotides per second. The structures do not occur on supercoiled or nicked circular DNA, indicating that free ends are needed for their formation. In the absence of DNA binding protein only internal unwinding structures are seen, suggesting that the internal structures are formed from the terminal unwindings by base-pairing of their unwound single-strand tails. We present a model which incorporates these structures and is consistent with previous observations on the unwinding and degradative actions of the enzyme. In this model the enzyme travels through duplex DNA by unwinding the DNA ahead of itself and rewinding it behind itself. The internal unwindings produced by the RecBC enzyme could be active in the initial synapsis step in genetic recombination."
https://openalex.org/W2037320704,"ROAM mutations cause overproduction in S. cerevisiae. Overproduction of ROAM mutant gene products is less in MATa/MAT alpha diploid strains which cannot conjugate than in haplolid strains which can. Overproduction occurs in diploid strains capable of mating whether or not they are capable of sporulating. Overproduction decreases when haploid ROAM mutants also contain the ste7 mutation which prevents conjugation; other ste mutations do not affect the expression of ROAM mutations. Cloning of the ROAM mutant gene CYC7-H2 shows that a 5.5 kb sequence homologous to a transposable and reiterated Ty1 element is inserted in the 5' noncoding region of the CYC7 structural locus. The similar genetic properties of other ROAM mutations suggest that they each contain an inserted Ty element. These results also suggest that ROAM mutations respond to signals normally directed toward genes controlling conjugation functions, and that sequences present in Ty elements may be adjacent to structural loci and are the normal receptors for these signals."

https://openalex.org/W2090385316,"The nucleotide sequences of the long terminal repeat (LTR) from six independently derived avian retrovirus recombinant DNA clones have been determined. The LTRs from three clones are approximately 350 bp in length and differ only in minor base insertions or substitutions. Three other clones have smaller LTRs, each with a large deletion which ranged from 89 to 161 bp. Sequence comparisons of the six LTRs indicate that there is conservation of sequences derived from the 5' terminus of viral RNA and extensive divergence of the 3'-specific sequences. The LTR sequences were obtained from clones of unintegrated viral DNA. Comparison of these LTRs with the sequence of an integrated Schmidt-Ruppin D provirus deduced previously reveals that two nucleotides present at the terminus of the LTR of the unintegrated DNA are absent in the integrated provirus. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the LTR from one clone, lambda RAV2-2, reveals several putative regulatory sites for the initiation and termination of transcription. There are also several structural features of the LTR which are analogous to procaryotic and eucaryotic transposable elements. These structural analogies include the presence of inverted complementary repeats at the termini of the LTR, deletions adjacent to LTR termini, and sequence homologies with transposable and other genetic elements. These observations suggest that the LTR of retroviruses function in the control of gene expression and integration."

https://openalex.org/W1640096102,"Arachidonic acid was co-oxidized by xanthine oxidase. Both superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide were required for oxidation, as shown by essentially complete inhibition caused by superoxide dismutase or by catalase. Pure arachidonate, free of lipid hydroperoxides, was susceptible to this co-oxidation, and the presence of lipid hydroperoxides did not accelerate the process. The role of trace metals was indicated by the stimulatory effect of EDTA-Fe and by the inhibitory effect of diethylenetriamine pentaacetate. Initiation of arachidonate co-oxidation was due to a potent oxidant generated by the interaction of H2O2 and O2- in the presence of Fe, rather than to either O2- or H2O2 per se. Hence, mannitol, a scavenger of OH ., but not of O2- or H2O2, also inhibited oxidation. Arachidonic acid autoxidation, a much slower process than xanthine oxidase co-oxidation, was barely detectable on the time scale of these observations. Unlike the co-oxidation, autoxidation was autocatalytic and therefore accelerated by hydroperoxide products. Marked quantitative differences in the distribution of isomeric hydroperoxide products of enzymic co-oxidation, as compared to the autoxidation, were noted and their significance was discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1983697215,"We have prepared a 2-pyridyl-dithiopropionate derivative of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and conjugated the derivative by disulfide interchange to the A chain of ricin (RTA) or to fragment A of diphtheria toxin (DTA). The EGF-RTA conjugate was toxic to 3T3 cells at concentrations (10−9–10−11 M) similar to those at which EGF exerts its biological activity and within an order of magnitude of the toxicity of ricin. Ricin A chain alone only exerted toxic effects at concentrations (10−6–10−7 M) three to four orders of magnitude higher than required for the activity of the EGF-RTA conjugate or ricin. An unconjugated mixture of RTA and EGF had no greater effect than RTA alone. Toxicity of the EGF-RTA conjugate on 3T3 cells was competed by EGF and was blocked by antibodies to RTA, but not by lactose or antibodies to the ricin B chain (RTB). In contrast to the EGF-RTA conjugate, the EGF-DTA conjugate proved virtually nontoxic at concentrations as high as 3 × 10−8 M. Control experiments showed that the EGF-DTA conjugate retained EGF receptor binding activity; the DTA moiety of the hybrid retained ADP-ribosyltransferase activity; and the disulfide bridge linking DTA to EGF was readily reducible."
https://openalex.org/W1481096871,"The MA-10 line is a clonal strain of Leydig tumor cells that has receptors for human choriogonadotropin (hCG) and mouse epidermal growth factor (mEGF). These cells respond to hCG, cholera toxin, and 8-Br-adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate with increased steroid production. It is reported herein that exposure of the MA-10 cells to mEGF results in a substantial (80 to 90%) reduction in the number of hCG receptors per cell. The loss of hCG receptors is accompanied by a corresponding reduction in the ability of hCG to stimulate steroidogenesis. The steroidogenic responses to cholera toxin and 8-Br-adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate, however, are not affected. Other results presented show that mEGF is not a mitogen for these cells."

https://openalex.org/W1587027743,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme was solubilized from bovine lung with detergent and purified over 2300-fold to physical homogeneity by a combination of ammonium sulfate fractionation, molecular sieve chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography. The purified enzyme had an apparent molecular weight of 126,000 in both the denatured, and reduced, denatured forms as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified enzyme had a specific activity of 13.6 units/mg. It was inhibited by EDTA and activated by chloride ion. Chloride functioned as a nonessential activator by raising the Vmax 4.26-fold and lowering the KM 5.99-fold under saturating conditions. Under these conditions, the Vmax was 1.2 mumol/min/unit and the KM was 1.3 mM. Three series of peptides having the general structures, Hip-His-X, Hip-X-Leu, and Hip-X-His-Leu were synthesized and used to examine the binding specificity and substrate specificity of the enzyme for amino acids in the COOH-terminal (P'2), penultimate COOH-terminal (P'1), and antepenultimate COOH terminal (P1) peptide positions. These studies indicated that in terms of binding specificity, the relative importance of these three positions was P'2 > P'1 > P1, while the reverse order P1 > P'1 > P'2 was observed for the relative contribution to substrate specificity. Three peptides, Hip-His-D-Leu, Hip-D-His-Leu, and Hip-D-Phe-His-Leu, were also synthesized and used to examine the stereochemical requirements of the enzyme in terms of both peptide binding and hydrolysis. Hydrolysis was found to require an L amino acid in all three positions. In contrast, all three peptides bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1488242159,"Ovarian granulosa cells obtained from hypophysectomized, diethylstilbestrol-treated rats were cultured in the presence of ovine follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). FSH stimulated the production and accumulation of both cAMP and cGMP, as well as progesterone, during a 48-h incubation period. Addition of GnRH or an agonist analog, [D-Ala6]des-Gly10-GnRH N-ethylamide (GnRHa), did not influence the cyclic nucleotide response to FSH in the first 6 h of incubation, but caused dose-dependent inhibition of the FSH-induced rise in cyclic nucleotide production from 24 to 48 h of incubation. Cellular production of both cyclic nucleotides and progesterone was decreased by GnRHa concentrations as low as 10(-12) M, with maximum inhibition at 10(-9) M GnRHa. These results suggest that the in vitro antigonadal actions of GnRH and related peptides are expressed through inhibition of cyclic nucleotide production."
https://openalex.org/W1550516180,"Human chylomicrons were isolated from plasma from a subject with familial hypertriglyceridemia and converted to chylomicron remnants by incubation with postheparin plasma. The interaction of these apolipoprotein E-containing, cholesterol-rich human chylomicron remnants with cultured skin fibroblasts was studied. Chylomicron remnants were internalized by skin fibroblasts as a unit, mainly via the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor pathway, resulting in increased cell cholesterol content. After entering the fibroblast, chylomicron remnants stimulated cholesterol esterification, suppressed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, and down-regulated LDL receptor activity similar to the action of LDL. As a function of increasing lipolysis, remnant particles were progressively more effectively taken up by skin fibroblasts, despite a decrease in the apolipoprotein E content per lipoprotein particle. Remnant particles produced after hydrolysis of 70 to 80% of chylomicron triglyceride increased cell cholesterol content to an amount nearly identical to that observed with LDL when the two lipoproteins were incubated at an equal cholesterol concentration. However, when incubated on the basis of equal particle number, chylomicron remnants were 2 to 3 times more effective than LDL in delivering cholesterol to the cells. These results suggest that chylomicron remnants play a role in the regulation of postabsorptive cholesterol homeostasis in nonhepatic cells, and possibly in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1551897021,"Extracts of HeLa cells containing RNA polymerase II and other factors recognize specific sites on linear simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA for initiation of transcription. The most prominent RNA products transcribed from the early region of SV40 and th E strand are initiated at sites 0.67 and 0.655 on the SV40 map. These two RNAs are synthesized by polymerase II. Their 5' termini were positioned by sizing transcripts that extend from the initiation site to the end of the template restriction endonuclease fragment, and by S1-nuclease mapping of unlabeled RNA using DNA probes labeled at their 5' termini. The limit of resolution of mapping of 5' termini is approximately 25 nucleotides. RNAs with 5' termini at similar positions have been found during characterization of mRNAs produced in infected cells. Thus, the whole cell extract is probably initiating transcription on linear SV40 DNA in vitro at the same sites as RNAs synthesized in vivo. Two other processes frequently involved in mammalian cell mRNA biosynthesis, creation of specific 3'-terminal polyadenine tracts and RNA splicing, were not detected during the course of these studies."

https://openalex.org/W1583571376,"Abstract A group of three mutants of Chinese hamster ovary cells (10260, 10265, and 10223) which are resistant to cyclic AMP (Gottesman, M. M., LeCam, A., Bukowski, M., and Pastan I. (1980) Somatic Cell Genet. 6, 45-61) have been characterized in this work. By genetic analysis, these mutants are all recessive and fall into two complementation groups. Cycl AMP-stimulated protein kinase activity in crude extracts of these mutants using histone as a substrate is decreased to 10 and 7% (complementation group I), and 31% (complementation group II), respectively, of the activity found in wild type extracts. The binding of cyclic [3H]AMP by extracts of all of these mutants is decreased to 30 to 50% of the binding found in wild type extracts. We have used the photoaffinity label 8-azidoadenosine 3':5'-[32P]monophosphate to label the regulatory subunits of type I and type II protein kinase in wild type and mutant extracts analyzed by DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex chromatography. We find that all three mutants lack type I cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and have reduced amounts of type II kinase activity. The regulatory subunits of type I and type II kinase are present in both complementation groups. We conclude that type I protein kinase is not needed for normal growth of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The defect in both classes of mutants appears to be in the failure of the catalytic subunit to associate normally with its regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1574231177,"The envelope glycoprotein, G, of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is initially glycosylated by the en bloc transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides to 2 specific asparagine residues in the nascent polypeptide chain. We carried out in vivo and in vitro studies to determine whether the size of the oligosaccharide chains on two related but different G proteins can affect their ability to fold correctly. For the in vivo studies we used a mutant lymphoma cell line, Thy-1-e, which transfers the truncated oligosaccharide, Glc3Man5GlcNAc2, to nascent polypeptides. The growth of VSV in these cells was temperature-sensitive compared to that in parental Thy-1+ cells, and VSV (San Juan) was more affected than VSV (Orsay). These results are congruous with our previous observation that in the absence of glycosylation virus assembly is temperature-sensitive and VSV (San Juan) is inhibited more than VSV (Orsay). To examine the effect of oligosaccharide size on the properties of the G protein in vitro we treated G proteins containing either Man8GlcNAc2 or Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide chains with guanidine hydrochloride and measured their ability to refold using an in vitro aggregation assay. The San Juan G protein with Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides aggregated at 40 degrees C but not at 30 degrees C. The Orsay G protein with Man5GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides and both proteins containing Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides did not aggregate at either temperature. We conclude that the size of the oligosaccharides present on the folding G protein can be crucial in attaining a proper conformation, and the extent of their effect depends on the primary structure of the polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W2010815371,"The restriction fragment patterns of the DNA of three white pock (mu) nonhost range mutants RPmu mutants) of rabbit poxvirus (RPV) show the presence of net insertions of DNA. Two of the mutants (RPmu21 and RPmu7) contain two molar quantities of 13 X 10(6) and 15 X 10(6) daltons, respectively, of the left-most viral DNA sequences. The extra copy of these sequences was inserted into the right-most region of the viral genome which in both cases had been modified by deletion of 10 X 10(6) daltons of the original extreme right-most DNA sequences. Hence two mutants with ""left-hand"" mirror image termini of 13 X 10(6) and 15 X 10(6) daltons of DNA were generated with an overall net increase in mass of 3 X 10(6) and 5 X 10(6) daltons of DNA to yield genome molecular weights of 121 X 10(6) and 123 X 10(6) for RPmu21 and 7, respectively. A third mutant (RPmu81g) contained 28 X 10(6) daltons of the right-most parental DNA sequences inserted into the left end of the genome, which had deleted 6 X 10(6) daltons of the extreme left-hand sequences. This variant contains ""right-hand"" mirror image termini of 28 X 10(6) daltons of DNA and a net increase in molecular weight of 22 X 10(6) daltons of DNA to yield a genome molecular weight of 140 X 10(6). The cross-linked end of the transposed sequences is retained in all cases. Our data suggest that the terminal DNA sequences at either end of the virus are not essential for a productive infection in certain host cells and that the pathogenicity of orthopoxviruses may be related in part to a series of varied and interchangeable DNA sequences located at both extremes of a high conserved genome core."
https://openalex.org/W1575325202,"A unique resonance in the 13C NMR spectrum of [13C]methylated ribonuclease A has been assigned to a N epsilon, N-dimethylated active site residue, lysine 41. The chemical shift of this resonance was studied over the pH range 3 to 11, and the titration curve showed two inflection points, at pH 5.7 and 9.0. The higher pKa, designated pKa1, was assigned to the ionization of the lysyl residue itself while the pKa of 5.7, designated pKa2, was assigned on the basis of its pKa to the ionization of a histidyl residue which is somehow coupled to lysine 41. Both pKa values are measurably perturbed by the binding of active site ligands including nucleotides, nucleosides, phosphate, and sulfate. In most cases, the alterations in pKa values induced by the ligands were larger for pKa2. The ligand-induced perturbations in pKa2 generally paralleled those reported for histidine 12, another active site residue (Griffin, J. H., Schechter, A. N., and Cohen, J. S. (1973) Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 222, 693-708). The sensitivity of the N epsilon, N-dimethylated lysine 41 resonance to the histidyl ionization may result from a conformational change in the active site region of ribonuclease which is coupled to the histidyl ionization. This coupling between lysine 41 and another ribonuclease residue, which has not been documented previously, offers new insight into the interrelationship between residues in the active site of this well characterized enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1585454041,"Abstract Binding of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH, pyro-Glu1-His2-Trp3-Ser4-Tyr5-Gly6-Leu7-Arg8-Pro9-Gly-NH210) to its plasma membrane receptor is the first step leading to the release of pituitary luteinizing hormone. As in the case of other plasma membrane receptors, patching, capping, and internalization of this hormone-receptor complex occurs rapidly following exposure of cultured pituitary cells to physiological levels of releasing hormone. In the present study we sought to determine whether gonadotropin release could occur under conditions which rigorously excluded internalization. A GnRH analog, D-Lys6-GnRH (to which a small quantity of [125I]iodoTyr5-D-Lys6-GnRH was added), was coupled by its epsilon-amino group with an N-hydroxysuccinimide ester then, through a 10-A spacer arm, to a cross-linked agarose matrix. Exposure of the product to proteases, soaps, detergents, solvents, chaotropic agents, or cell cultures resulted in dissociation of < 0.28% of biologically active releasing hormone. The apparent potency of the immobilized analog was one-fourth that of the free form and it was still capable of evoking a full luteinizing hormone secretory response. It can, therefore, be concluded that internalization of GnRH is not required for gonadotropin release."
https://openalex.org/W1659807941,"Although substantial evidence supports the conclusion that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the major regulatory enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, the molecular events involved in the in vivo regulation of this enzyme have remained obscure. In order to study this problem, rats received a single meal consisting of either rat chow or rat chow containing 2% cholesterol. The rats were killed 60 or 120 min after the beginning of feeding, and liver microsomes were prepared by ultracentrifugation. Two phases of inhibition of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase were observed. The first phase of inhibition, observed 60 min after the beginning of cholesterol feeding, was completely reversed by preincubation of the microsomes with purified phosphoprotein phosphatase. The second phase of inhibition, observed 120 min after the beginning of cholesterol feeding, was not reversed by phosphoprotein phosphatase. These results are consistent with the conclusion that phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase is the first step in a series of in vivo regulatory events which produce inactivation and ultimately degradation of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W2020957952,"Clones of SV40 tsA mutant-transformed mouse embryo cells with a temperature-independent transformed growth phenotype were derived from a parental line with a temperature-dependent growth phenotype, using the selective pressure of anchorage independent growth in agar at 40 degrees C. The parental J78 clone contained a complex tandem structure of integrated SV40 DNA within two cellular DNA fragments of 10 and 14 kb, generated by Bgl II digestion. The new clonal derivatives, in addition to an altered growth phenotype, displayed additional high molecular weight sites of SV40 DNA integration. A marked structural similarity among integration sites suggested that the new sites may have arisen by duplication and translocation of an original integration structure, or via an unequal crossover event. The rearrangement of viral DNA sequences appears to be specifically associated with the emergence of temperature-independent clones, since the isolation of new clones under nonselective conditions, that is, growth in semi-solid medium at 33 degrees C, was not accompanied by modification in cellular sequences containing SV40 DNA."

Labeling by intact cells of one component, identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and autoradiography, could be specifically inhibited by the presence of nonradioactive cAMP. The component, P45 (apparent molecular weight of 45,000), was not identified on vegetative cells but was labeled with increasing intensity as cells differentiated and increased their levels of surface cAMP binding sites. Developmental mutants, starved under conditions where they do not express significant levels of cAMP binding sites, did not incorporate radioactivity into this protein. These mutants did label P45 when starved under differentiation-inducing conditions such that their levels of surface cAMP binding sites increased. P45 co-purified with the plasma membrane fraction isolated from cells to which 8-N3-[32p]cAMP had been covalently bound. Down-regulated amoebae, which displayed approximately 25% of the binding activity of untreated cells, did not label P45. These cells did, however, label a new component with an apparent molecular weight of 47,000 (P47).l The appearance of this component represented the only discernible difference in labeling profile under these conditions.

https://openalex.org/W1498301441,"Crude microsomal preparations from hen oviduct catalyze the transfer of [32P]phosphate from [gamma-32P]CTP or [gamma-32P]dCTP to endogenous dolichol, forming dolichyl [32P]monophosphate. The oviduct kinase activity assayed with [gamma-32P]CTP is stimulated by divalent cations and exogenous dolichol. The enzymatic formation of dolichyl [32P]monophosphate is inhibited by dCDP and CDP, but not CMP, ADP, GDP, or UDP. The hen oviduct kinase is inhibited 50% by the addition of 38 microM CDP, but 101 microM dCDP is required for 50% inhibition. The amount of dolichol kinase activity in chick oviduct microsomes increases 3.7-fold within 10 days of estrogen administration. The hormone-induced increase in kinase activity is also observed when membranes from untreated and estrogen-treated chicks are assayed in the presence of saturating levels of exogenous dolichol. The microsomal preparations from oviducts of untreated chicks and fully induced birds both exhibit an apparent Km value of 7.1 microM for CTP. An apparent Km of 14 microM has been determined for dCTP. Thus, the developmental change in dolichol kinase activity does not appear to be the result of a difference in the amount of available endogenous dolichol or an alteration in the reactive site for the nucleoside triphosphate substrate, but is probably due to an increased level of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1597376955,"Cycl AMP concentrations were elevated and acrosome reactions were induced in intact sea urchin spermatozoa by Nigericin, A23187, and pH 9.0 seawater. To determine whether or not the metabolism of cyclic AMP was being altered in sperm heads, the heads were mechanically separated from the flagella, and the flagella-less heads were then isolated by differential centrifugation. The isolated heads contained 1 to 2 nmol of ATP and 1 to 2 pmol of cyclic AMP/mg wet weight and retained these concentrations for several hours if stored at 0 degrees C. The flagella-less heads also retained the mitochondria of the midpiece area. The heads retained their functional status and could be stimulated to undergo acrosome reactions (filament extension) in response to Nigericin, A23187, or pH 9.0 seawater. Furthermore, the isolated heads could activate sea urchin eggs after induction of an acrosome reaction by Nigericin or pH 9.0 seawater. The isolated heads contained appreciable adenylate cyclase, cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, guanylate cyclase, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, and calmodulin. Nigericin, pH 9.0 seawater, and A23187 caused not only the induction of an acrosome reaction but also elevations of cyclic AMP in the isolated heads, and extracellular Ca2+ was an absolute requirement for both responses. At 16 degrees C, Nigericin caused elevations of cyclic AMP within 5 s, but maximal elevations were not observed until 1 min; it induced a maximal percentage of acrosome reactions by 40 s. Incubation of cells at 0 degrees C resulted in a delay of maximal acrosome reactions until between 10 and 20 min after addition of Nigericin. Under these conditions, maximal elevations of cyclic AMP were observed by 5 min, demonstrating that cyclic AMP elevations precede the complete morphological change associated with an acrosome reaction. ATP concentrations within the sperm heads declined in response to Nigericin, pH 9.0 seawater, or A23187, and its decrease also required the presence of extracellular Ca2+. The decline in ATP concentrations was slightly more rapid in the presence of rotenone, suggestive of some ATP synthetic capabilities of the isolated head preparation. 45Ca2+ uptake was increased by Nigericin elevated pH, and A23187 but was not appreciably altered by monensin. Monensin also did not cause appreciable elevations of cyclic AMP concentrations, induction of an acrosome reaction, or decreases of ATP concentrations. Here, we describe for the first time that cyclic AMP concentrations can be increased in flagella-less heads of spermatozoa and show that these changes are associated with an acrosome reaction."

In this model, aldosterone is known to bind to two classes of binding sites: type I (mineralocorticoid) and type II (glucocorticoid). The study of the aldosterone binding in normal rat kidney requires the elimination of endogenous hormones bound to each type of receptor. Thus, a suitable technique was developed using in situ perfusion of the kidneys. The efficacy of this method was of about 85 to 90% at the level of both cytoplasm and nucleus. Aldosterone binding capacity was checked in normal rat kidney after in situ perfusion and was found to be 300 to 500% lower than in adrenalectomized rat kidney, both in cytoplasm and nuclei. Computer analysis of aldosterone binding parameters in the cytoplasm (30,000 X g supernatant) of rat kidney suggested that adrenalectomy might induce an important rise in the number of mineralocorticoid receptors (congruent to 260%). An increase in the number of glucocorticoid receptors was also observed but appeared to be lower. Aldosterone, when perfused during 24 h in adrenalectomized rats, lowered the number of type I sites to the same level as observed in normal rat kidney. This effect was fully reversible after interruption of aldosterone perfusion. These results suggested an aldosterone-induced down regulation of mineralocorticoid receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1656462841,"We have studied the relationship between adeno-associated virus (AAV) DNA replication and virus particle assembly. Formation of empty or full particles and accumulation of AAV capsid proteins was prevented in the presence of the arginine analogue, L-canavanine, or when a temperature-sensitive helper adenovirus was used at the nonpermissive temperature. In each case there was a concomitant inhibition of AAV single-stranded (progeny) DNA accumulation but little or no effect upon synthesis of AAV duplex, replicating form DNA. These results indicate that AAV protein, perhaps in the form of assembled capsids, is required for AAV single-stranded progeny DNA accumulation."

https://openalex.org/W1531617991,"Abstract The presence of 50 mM nicotinamide together with 100 milliunits/ml of TSH in the incubation medium prevented the decline in human thyroid cell cAMP from maximum, stimulated levels (15-30 min) that occurs when the cells are exposed to TSH alone. Nicotinamide in the absence of TSH did not increase thyroid cell cAMP content. TSH desensitization, and its prevention by nicotinamide, occurred in the presence or absence of 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine. 1-Methyl nicotinamide and N'-methyl nicotinamide similarly prevented TSH desensitization. Recovery from TSH desensitization was prolonged and incomplete after 72 h. The presence of 50 mM nicotinamide hastened recovery from desensitization. Desensitization of the cAMP response to 10(6) M prostaglandin E1 and 1 mM adenosine was unaffected by nicotinamide. Other inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity, 5-bromouridine, 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine, and thymidine (all at 50 mM) completely or partially prevented TSH desensitization. Pyridoxine (50 mM) similarly prevented this phenomenon. As with dog thyroid cells, 10(-4) M cycloheximide blocked TSH desensitization. The combination of 10(-4) M cycloheximide and 50 mM nicotinamide had a synergistic effect in augmenting the thyroid cell cAMP response to TSH stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1589856537,"Vitamin D3-3 beta-sulfate has been synthesized using pyridine sulfur trioxide as the sulfate donor. It has been shown to be pure by high performance liquid chromatography and spectral methods. Unlike previous reports, the product has been identified unambiguously as the 3 beta-sulfate ester of vitamin D3 by its ultraviolet, nuclear magnetic resonance, infrared, and mass spectra. The biological activity of vitamin D3-sulfate was then determined in vitamin D-deficient rats. Vitamin D3-sulfate has less than 5% of the activity of vitamin D3 to mobilize calcium from bone and approximately 1% of the ability of vitamin D3 to stimulate calcium transport, elevate serum phosphorus, or support bone calcification. These results disprove previous claims that vitamin D3-sulfate has potent biological activity, and they further do not support the contention that vitamin D-sulfate represents a potent water-soluble form of vitamin D in milk."
https://openalex.org/W1575337256,"The intrinsic factor receptor was isolated from Triton X-100 extract of hog ileal mucosa using affinity chromatography on intrinsic factor bound to cobalamin-Sepharose. We verified that the receptor contains two subunits, alpha and beta. The purified receptor located in the detergent micelle was radioiodinated. The alpha subunit was labeled and dissociated from the receptor. When the receptor was immobilized on intrinsic factor cobalamin-Sepharose, the part of the receptor which binds intrinsic factor evidently faces the gel and the rest faces outward. When such gel-bound pure receptor was iodinated, the beta subunit was labeled. Iodination of the micellar cobalamin-intrinsic factor receptor complex also caused labeling of the beta subunit. This was interpreted as being due to a conformational change in the receptor affected by the binding of the substrate cobalamin-intrinsic factor, exposing groups accessible to iodination. The beta subunit was found to be hydrophobic, but the alpha subunit was soluble in phosphate buffer without detergent. The receptor was liberated from intestinal mucosa by papain treatment. The enzyme seems to solubilize an intrinsic factor-binding part of the receptor, apparently a part of the alpha subunit. The liberated papain-alpha was purified by affinity chromatography. In gel filtration, it seemed to occur in dimeric form, but its true Mr = 45,000, according to findings in sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis. In the light of the findings, the topology of the receptor is suggested to be as follows: the alpha subunit binding intrinsic factor faces out and the hydrophobic beta subunit faces in."

https://openalex.org/W2011033870,"The rate of rat platelet shape change increases sigmoidally with respect to thrombin concentration under conditions where free Ca++ and ADP are limited to prevent platelet aggregation. In addition, the rate of shape change due to thrombin is considerably enhanced when the platelets are first treated with concanavalin A (Con A), an agent which itself produces shape change. In the presence of both agents the rate is considerably greater than the sum of the rates due to Con A and thrombin separately. This suggests that shape change itself may trigger increased platelet sensitivity to thrombin. One possible mechanism through which this might occur is that shape change promotes binding of thrombin to its surface receptors. If so, then Con A-induced shape change might facilitate binding of 125I-thrombin. Initial binding studies using previously described methods showed that nonspecific trapping of 125I-thrombin, which is bound specifically to platelets during shape change, prevents accurate measurements of thrombin binding. We found, however, that a portion of 125I-thrombin which is bound specifically to platelets forms a stable complex with a 40,000 dalton platelet protein. This complex cannot be disrupted by boiling in SDS buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol. Linkage of 125I-thrombin to this protein is specific for thrombin, since it can be competed for by an excess of unlabeled thrombin and because a similar complex does not form using 125I-trypsin. Concentrations of Con A that induce platelet shape change also markedly increase the amount of complex produced by a given thrombin concentration. In addition, colchicine, an inhibitor of Con A-induced platelet function, markedly inhibits formation of the 125I-thrombin-receptor complex. We suggest that the sigmoidal response to thrombin might be related to appearance of new thrombin receptors on the platelet surface."
https://openalex.org/W1538056767,"Detailed restriction enzyme maps have been determined for the three major rat casein and the fourth principal milk protein, alpha-lactalbumin, cDNA clones. Each of the milk protein genes exhibited unique and characteristic restriction enzyme sites. A comparison of the restriction enzyme maps of the three rat caseins revealed no apparent sequence homology among their gene sequences. The orientation of each cDNA gene sequence within the parent plasmid, pBR322, was determined by hybridization with a 3' specific cDNA probe synthesized from a partially hydrolyzed total poly(A) mRNA preparation following isolation by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose. This technique provided a rapid procedure for determining the 5'-3' orientation of the cloned DNA sequences. Three casein clones were selected, which were in the same orientation, and were employed for a heteroduplex analysis to determine whether minor regions of homology existed within the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-casein genes. No heteroduplex formation was observed among these genes even under the low stringency conditions of hybridization employed, suggesting that considerable sequence divergence has occurred within the rat casein gene family."
https://openalex.org/W1524700912,Phosphorylation of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen synthase by cyclic AMP-independent synthase kinase 1 results in the incorporation of 4 mol of PO4/subunit. Incubation of the phosphorylated synthase with rabbit muscle phosphoprotein phosphatase brings about the hydrolysis of phosphates from all four major tryptic peptides and an increase in the synthase activity ratio from 0.01 to 0.85. Incubation of the phosphorylated synthase with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase brings about the preferential hydrolysis of phosphates from three of the four major tryptic peptides and a slight increase in the four major tryptic peptides and a slight increase in the synthase activity ratio from 0.01 to 0.1. The phosphorylation site which is resistant to hydrolysis by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase can be dephosphorylated by subsequent incubation with rabbit muscle phosphoprotein phosphatase. This dephosphorylation is accompanied by an increase in the synthase activity ratio to approximately 0.9. Measurements of the changes in the kinetic properties of the synthase samples dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase reveal that the phosphorylation sites susceptible to hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase mainly affect the binding of glucose-6-P to the synthase. Comparison of the kinetic properties of the synthase samples dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase and by phosphoprotein phosphatase we find that the phosphorylation site resistant to hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase affects both the binding of UDP-glucose and glucose-6-P to the synthase.
https://openalex.org/W1497265592,"The kinetics of formation of noncovalently bound ferrous complexes derived from fragments of horse heart cytochrome c have been investigated. When the reactions are initiated by combining ferrous heme fragments with an appropriate apofragment, in the presence of 50 mM imidazole, second order rate processes are observed with rate constants essentially the same as those reported with ferric heme fragments (Parr, G. R., and Taniuchi, H. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 4836-4842). An additional, probably consecutive, kinetic process is also demonstrated. If imidazole is not present in the reaction buffer, the kinetic profiles are dramatically altered. While this is partially due to aggregation (dimerization) of the ferrous heme fragments, it can nevertheless be demonstrated that the complementation reactions with apofragments are much faster than those observed with the corresponding ferric heme fragments (in the absence of imidazole). These results reflect the effect of the oxidation state of the heme iron on the folding mechanism and, thus, the manifold nature of protein folding pathways. The rate of reduction of productive ferric complexes by sodium ascorbate was investigated and biphasic reactions were found in all cases. The data indicate an equilibrium between two forms of the ferric complexes. The results of an experiment in which the complementation of ferric (1-25)H and (23-104) was carried out in the presence of sodium ascorbate indicate that the intermediate complex (Parr, G. R., and Taniuchi, H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8914-8918) is not reducible by ascorbate. Thus, the increase in oxidation-reduction potential occurring on formation of the productive complex from the unbound heme fragment occurs at a late stage of the overall reaction, possibly coinciding with ligation of methionine 80 to the heme iron."
https://openalex.org/W1585137739,"Anaerobic reduction of cytochrome c oxidase by 5,10-dihydro-5-methylphenazine (reduced PMS) and by sodium dithionite were studied by rapid scanning stopped flow spectrophotometry. In both cases the decay of the Soret band of the oxidized oxidase is not uniform. With reduced PMS, the reduction involves two molecules of reductant (4 electrons)/oxidase molecule. The first stage of the reduction exhibits an isosbestic point in the Soret region at 437 nm. This shifts to 428 nm in later stages of the reaction. The reduction of the oxidase by sodium dithionite is also complete and apparently involves SO2 radical. In this case the spectra show an isosbestic point at approximately 420 nm which shifts to 432 nm as the reaction proceeds. For each of the reductants the reaction is best described by three phases: the first is a second order reaction between the oxidase and the reductant, followed by two first order processes which appear to describe the intramolecular electron redistribution within the oxidase molecule. The results agree with the assignment of the Soret band of the oxidase molecule to cytochrome a3 with an absorption maximum near 410 nm and to cytochrome a which has its maximum absorption hear 430 nm. If these assignments are correct, the present data show that reduced PMS, an uncharged molecule, reacts more rapidly with cytochrome a than it does with cytochrome a3, while the negatively charged radical anion, SO2, appears to have more direct access to cytochrome a3."
https://openalex.org/W1643915825,"The inhibition kinetic patterns obtained when ATP and pyridoxal analogues are used as inhibitors of the reaction catalyzed by pyridoxal kinase are consistent with a rapid equilibrium random Bi Bi, in which binary complexes, i.e. enzyme . ATP and enzyme . pyridoxal, are formed in kinetically significant amounts. Protein fluorescence quenching was used to determine the dissociation constant (Kd = 25 microM) of ATP . Zn bound to the nucleotide site of the kinase. The binding of ATP to the kinase induces a conformational change which is transmitted to other areas of the macromolecule. Pyridoxaloxime, a competitive inhibitor of pyridoxal, was used as a probe of the pyridoxal-binding site. It binds to the kinase with Ki = 2 microM and displays a fluorescent decay time of 7.8 ns. Time emission anisotropy measurements yield a rotational correlation time for bound pyridoxaloxime of approximately 2 ns, which is considerably shorter than the rotational correlation time of the protein (phi = 38 ns). The fast rotation of pyridoxaloxime remains unaffected by the binding of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1531566882,"Oxidation of cytochrome c peroxidase with hydrogen peroxide to form the initial oxidized intermediate, cytochrome c peroxidase compound I, drastically alters the proton hyperfine nmr spectrum. In contrast to studies of horseradish peroxidase, where the spectrum of horseradish peroxidase compound I is similar to that of the native protein, cytochrome c peroxidase compound I exhibits only broad resonances near 17 and 30 ppm from 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. No unique resonances attributable to cytochrome c peroxidase compound II could be identified. These results define the molecular conditions for which resolved hyperfine resonances of the iron(IV) states of heme proteins may be observed when the data presented here are compared with the data from horseradish peroxidase. Oxidation of cytochrome c peroxidase while it is complexed to ferricytochrome c reveals that the heme resonances of cytochrome c are not influenced by the oxidation state of cytochrome c peroxidase."
https://openalex.org/W2171137995,"The binding site topographies of the three thyroid hormone-transporting proteins in human serum–prealbumin, thyroxine binding globulin, human serum albumin–have been studied with the aid of five spin-labeled analogs of L-thyroxine in which the distance between the phenolic hydroxyl and the nitroxide nitrogen ranged from 17 to 23 A. In the presence of prealbumin, the electron spin resonance spectrum of 3-([alpha-carboxy-4-(4-hydroxy-3,5-diiodophenoxy)-3,5-diiodophenethyl]-carbamoyl)-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-3-pyrrolinl-yloxy-ethyl ester revealed the presence of a highly immobilized spin label. As the chain length between the thyroxyl moiety and the pyrroline ring was increased, the mobility of the nitroxide group in the prealbumin-bound labels increased. If the spin labels bind in an extended conformation, the thyroxine-binding site was estimated to be approximately 21 A in depth. This finding is consistent with the known crystal structure of prealbumin and suggests that the solution and crystal conformations of the protein are very similar. In contrast to prealbumin, the thyroxine-binding site on thyroxine-binding globulin was found to be more open and possibly deeper. Human serum albumin has two binding sites for thyroxine, one of which has a higher affinity and is deep enough to accommodate a molecule that is 23 A in length. The lower affinity site is somewhat shallower and probably wider, as thyroxine spin labels bound to this site exhibited greater mobility."
https://openalex.org/W2141500642,"Normal rat kidney cells (NRK) have been transformed with an avian sarcoma virus (ASV) mutant that induces a temperature-sensitive transformed phenotype. When compared in vitro different ASV-transformed clones showed different degrees of morphological transformation at the permissive temperature, while they all reverted to normal at 39 degrees C. Comparisons of the polypeptide patterns of the different cells showed two things. First, a group of about 30 polypeptides, amounting to 5% of all the polypeptides analyzed in normal cells, were affected in all ASV-transformed clones and also in two papovavirus-transformed clones and also in two papovavirus-transformed NRK clones. Second, the patterns were found to differ between the clones in that varying numbers of polypeptides were found to be affected depending on the clone; the number of polypeptide changes showed a good correlation with the degree of morphological transformation. At the nonpermissive temperature the polypeptide patterns of ts ASV-transformed cells were indistinguishable from that of the untransformed cells, which is in agreement with the morphological data."
https://openalex.org/W1524765179,"In order to define further the chemical features of the human placental lactogen (hPL) molecule responsible for its lactogenic activity, two derivatives of the hormone were prepared by treatment with BNPS-skatole (2-nitrophenylsulfenyl)-3-methyl-3'-bromoindolenine). At a molar ratio of reagent to hPL of 7:1, a derivative was produced in which the single tryptophan was completely oxidized. At higher ratios, a second derivative was formed in which the peptide chain was cleaved at the tryptophan residue and the two resulting fragments remained bound by the disulfide bond between Cys53 and Cys165. Oxidation of the single tryptophan resulted in reduced immunologic activity, reduced helical content as measured by circular dichroism below 240 nm, and changes in the near-UV circular dichroic spectrum, each indicating a change in the conformation of the hPL molecule. Nevertheless, this derivative retained 20% of its ability to bind to lactogenic receptors and 40 to 50% of its ability to stimulate N-acetyllactosamine synthetase in vitro. Cleavage at the tryptophan was not complete, but the loss of immunologic and biologic activity was equivalent to the degree of cleavage, indicating that the cleaved derivative was completely inactive. In addition, separation of the cleaved fragments from intact hormone followed by recombination did not generate any immunologic or biologic activity. We conclude that the single tryptophan of hPL is not essential for the biologic activity of hPL. It is likely that the reduced activity associated with modification or cleavage at the tryptophan residue is due to changes in the conformation of the molecule."
