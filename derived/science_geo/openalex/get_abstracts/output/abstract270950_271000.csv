https://openalex.org/W1967618364,"A two-fluid model of town traffic has been developed by extending ideas formulated in an earlier kinetic theory of multilane traffic. The-two fluids are taken to consist of moving cars and cars stopped as a result of traffic conditions. The average speed of the moving vehicles is assumed to be proportional to the fraction of the vehicles that are moving raised to a power that reflects the ""goodness"" of the traffic. It is then found that the trip time per unit distance is essentially linearly related to the stop time per unit distance, in general accord with data obtained in many cities. Relations are developed on this basis for flow, among other variables, versus average speed. These relations contain a new parameter that is identified with the quality of the traffic network system."
https://openalex.org/W2053568814,"Two 10,000-year periods of Northern Hemisphere continental ice-sheet growth stand out prominently within the last full interglacial-to-glacial cycle. During the first half of each rapid ice-growth phase, the subpolar North Atlantic from 40 degrees N to 60 degrees N maintained warm sea-surface temperatures comparable to those of today's ocean. The juxtaposition at latitudes 50 degrees N to 60 degrees N of an ""interglacial"" ocean along-side a ""glacial"" land mass, particularly along eastern North America, is regarded as an optimal configuration for delivering moisture to the growing ice sheets."
https://openalex.org/W2071721539,"A series of petroleum isoprenoid hydrocarbons possessing an unusual head-to-head linkage is present as an important component in petroleum. The entire series appears to be produced by diagenesis or catagenesis from precursors containing 40 carbon atoms. A suitable precursor compound has been reported in one type of living organism, thermoacidophile bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2054182354,"Application of a simple linear model to the earth's ice volume record of the past 730,000 years indicates that although forcing by variations in the earth's orbital parameters of tilt and precession is real, it is small (less than 25 percent of the variance in the record). No relationship with the eccentricity is observed. This indicates that the Pleistocene glacial variations are largely stochastic in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2062479063,S>Sponges from the floor of the Gulf of California were chemically treated to remove silica. Silicon-32 was determined by milking and by counting the P/sup 32/ daughter. The half life of Si/sup 32/ was determined to be 13 plus or minus 4 days. The average global production rate of Si/sup 32/ in the atmosphere was determined to be 1.0 x 10/sup -4/ atoms/cm/sup 2/ per sec. The distribution of Si/sup 32/ various depths in the oceans was calculated. (C.J.G.)

Honey deprivation decreases numbers surviving the winter; females that do survive without honey build smaller spring nests."
https://openalex.org/W2028817830,"The ion microscope was used to study potassium and calcium distributions in the main motor organ of Mimosa pudica L. The cortex of the motor organ has two cell types differing in location, structure, and ion distribution. Histochemical features portrayed in ion micrographs were plainly correlated with structures seen in the light and electron microscopes."

https://openalex.org/W2078635672,High electric fields have been used to extract organic cations from solutions of small organic molecules in polyphosphoric acid. The cations have been analyzed by mass spectrometry. Production of ions by this method is shown to be related to ease of protonation by acid rather than to ionization potential.
https://openalex.org/W2091393921,Tritiated thymidine enters readily into certain excised plant parts and into small aquatic plants. Attempts to introduce the radioisotope into shoot tips of seed plants via the roots have not proved satisfactory. The label readily enters the shoot if applied directly to immature leaves of a bud after the application of a wetting agent.
https://openalex.org/W2067862294,"Explicit integration of integrals of the type basic to comparison of observed and predicted values of the earth's mean total magnetic field reveals an error in the numerical integration recently employed by Raymond H. Wilson, Jr., in making such a comparison for the special case of Vanguard I. Correction of this error destroys the satisfactory agreement he found between the value implied by rotational damping and the theoretical value."
https://openalex.org/W1970602163,"The base of the continental slope, combined with the concepts of a boudary zone, a technical advisory boundary commission, and special treatment for restricted seas, offers a readily attainable, natural, practicable, and equitable boundary between national and international jurisdiction over the ocean floor. There is no point in bringing into the boundary formula the unnecessary added complication of thickness of sediments, as recently proposed. Review of the U.S. offshore brings out the critical importance with respect to energy resources of proper choice of boundary principles and proper determination of the base-of-continent line about our shores. The advice of the pertinent science and technology community should urgently be sought and contributed to decisions on offshore boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2098357689,"Although liquid-vapor explosions are widely observed, there is no established explanation for their initiation and propagation. Thermodynamics admits the possibility that superheated liquids can support detonations analogous to those that occur in chemical explosives. For liquid methane superheated 50 K above its boiling point at 1 atmosphere, the energy of explosion is 2 to 3 percent of that of TNT."

https://openalex.org/W2074941372,"Fraction 1 protein has been isolated from leaves of a male sterile Nicotiana tabacum plant containing an extra N. debneyichromosome. The extra chromosome induces appearance of a third polypeptide composing the small subunit of fraction 1 protein, which otherwise contains two polypeptides as is shown by analysis of numerous different cultivars of N. tabacum."
https://openalex.org/W2042492142,"Photoelectric measutements of the Hbeta intensity show that it continued to increase after a corona formed, and reached a maximum as the corona broke up into rays, decreasing rapidly to nearly zero within the next 10 minutes. The maximum flux of protons incident on the earth during the aurora, deduced from these measures, was at least 1.4 x 10(8) auroral protons per square centimeter, per second."
https://openalex.org/W1993289641,Excised barley roots in the presence of benzimidazole accumulate about twice as much potassium in 6 hours as those in a potassium source only. The enhanced rate of uptake is maintained steadily during this time. Sodium and calcium accumulation are similarly augmented but not at identical levels.

Little equipment is required, and the necessary materials are inexpensive. Satisfactory qualitative sampling is possible under varying conditions of relative humidity."
