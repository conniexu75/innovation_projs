https://openalex.org/W1495304774,"Following poliovirus infection of HeLa cells, the synthesis of cellular proteins is inhibited but translation of poliovirus mRNA proceeds. The defect in the recognition of host cell mRNA may be due to a change in a cap recognition complex which, when added to an infected cell lysate, restores the ability to translate capped mRNAs. We employed immunoblotting techniques to examine initiation factors in crude lysates from uninfected and poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Using an antiserum against eucaryotic initiation factor 3, we detected an antigen of approximate molecular weight 220,000 in uninfected cell lysates but not in infected cell lysates. Antigenically related polypeptides of 100,000 to 130,000 daltons, presumably degradation products, were detected in the infected cell lysate. The time course for degradation of the 220,000-dalton polypeptide correlates with that for inhibition of cellular protein synthesis in vivo. A portion of the population of 220,000-dalton polypeptides apparently associates with initiation factor eIF3 but is readily dissociated in buffers containing high salt. Affinity-purified antibodies against the polypeptide recognize a protein of the same size in a purified preparation of a cap binding protein complex obtained by cap-affinity chromatography. We postulate that the 220,000-dalton polypeptide is an essential component of the cap recognition complex and that its degradation in poliovirus-infected cells results in the inhibition of host cell translation. These results are in the first demonstration of a specific structural defect in an initiation factor resulting from poliovirus infection."

First, the formation of fluid droplets was visualized on the oil-covered mucosal surface directly over crypt duct openings when secretion was stimulated. Second, microelectrode impalement of individual surface and crypt cells revealed that only crypts cells produced a pattern of secretagogue induced alterations in membrane potential and resistance that was characteristic of secretory epithelia."

https://openalex.org/W1994051978,"The ethyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid has a high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. In the rhesus monkey this substance produces an acute behavioral syndrome characterized by dramatic elevations in heart rate, blood pressure, plasma cortisol, and catecholamines. The effects are blocked by benzodiazepines and the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. The benzodiazepine receptor may consist of several subsites or functional domains that independently recognize agonist, antagonists, or ""active"" antagonists such as beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester. These results suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor is involved in both the affective and physiological manifestations of anxiety, and that the administration of beta-carboxylic acid ethyl ester to monkeys may provide a reliable and reproducible animal model of human anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W1977939052,"Certain strains of streptococci have been shown to be capable of conjugatively transferring drug resistance determinants in the apparent absence of plasmid DNA1–6. The transferrable tetracycline resistance (Tcr) marker of Streptococcus faecalis DS16 has been located on a transposon, designated Tn 9162,4,7. We show here that when chromosomal Tn 916 is conjugatively transferred it inserts into a number of different sites on the recipient chromosome. Our studies also imply that transfer and transposition share a common step, which may be excision of the transposon from the donor chromosome."

https://openalex.org/W1530430739,"Bacteria are able to interact with a number of macromolecules which act as opsonins or tissue-adherence factors. Because soluble fibronectin may be important factors. Because soluble fibronectin may be important in the phagocytic removal of bacteria and insoluble fibronectin may serve as a bridge between bacteria and host tissues, we have characterized the binding of soluble plasma fibronectin to Staphylococcus aureus as a first step to understanding these interactions. The binding of 125I-fibronectin to clinical and laboratory strains of S. aureus was studied. Bound fibronectin was separated from free fibronectin by centrifugation. Specific binding was determined by subtracting the amount bound in the presence of excess fibronectin from the total amount bound. We found that (i) fibronectin bound saturably, irreversibly, and noncovalently to S. aureus when the binding reaction was carried out at pH 7.4 or greater; (ii) S. aureus harvested in logarithmic phase of growth from media buffered to pH 8.4, and from brain-heart infusion media which demonstrated the greatest number of fibronectin-binding sites; (iii) high molecular weight dextrans, fibrinogen, cyanogen bromide fragment 7 of collagen, cationic proteins, dibromide fragment 7 of collagen, cationic proteins, dithiothreitol, and protein A did not alt er fibronectin binding to S. aureus; (iv) nonsaturable binding occurred below pH 7.0 with peak binding occurring at pH 5.8; and (v) there were marked differences in the amounts of fibronectin that bind to different strains of S. aureus. S. aureus ATCC 25923, when harvested in logarithmic phase of growth from tryptic soy broth and tested for fibronectin binding in (2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid-buffered saline, pH 7.4, had 7500 binding sites/organism with an apparent association constant of 5.6 X 10(9) M-1."
https://openalex.org/W1548458004,"The crystal structure of cytochrome c3 from the sulfate-reducing bacteria Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Norway strain, has been determined through the fitting of the recently completed primary structure to a 2.5 A resolution electron density map. The phase calculations were based on three mercurial derivatives; anomalous scattering data were used to refine the four heme iron positions. A preliminary refinement of the molecular model has led to a conventional crystallographic R factor of 34%. Cytochrome c3 is folded in two structural domains with one heme in each, the two other heme moieties lying in a large groove dividing the molecule. The core of the protein is the compact four-heme cluster which presents a relatively high degree of solvent exposure. The structural pattern of redox centers suggests that electron transfer might occur through direct contacts between some of the heme groups, via the overlapping system of pi oribitals or via intervening amino acid side chains or both."
https://openalex.org/W1987208123,"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) analogs or agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP rapidly stimulate transcription of the prolactin gene in a line of cultured rat pituitary cells. This effect is correlated with the phosphorylation of a chromatin-associated basic protein designated BPR. These data are consistent with the postulate that increased intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations induce rapid transcriptional effects on specific genes in eukaryotes, mediated by direct or indirect phosphorylation of a specific chromatin-associated protein or proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1975922147,"Tumor induction in athymic nude mice can be used to detect dominant transforming genes in cellular DNA. Mouse NIH 3T3 cells freshly transfected with either cloned Moloney sarcoma proviral DNA or cellular DNA's derived from virally transformed cells induced tumors when injected into athymic nu/nu mice. Tumors were also induced by cells transfected with DNA from two tumor-derived and one chemically transformed human cell lines. The mouse tumors induced by human cell line DNA's contained human DNA sequences, and DNA derived from these tumors was capable of inducing both tumors and foci on subsequent transfection. Tumor induction in nude mice represents a useful new method for the detection and selection of cells transformed by cellular oncogenes."

https://openalex.org/W1567964079,"The pattern of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase isoenzyme response to acute hormonal activation has been studied in cultured cells derived from rat osteogenic sarcoma and osteoblast-rich cells grown from newborn rat calvaria. Using multiple small anion exchange columns and a batch elution technique, a rapid method of separating the isoenzymes of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was developed and the acute activation by parathyroid hormone and prostaglandin E2 of each isoenzyme was studied. Activation was rapid, being detectable at 5 s, maximal at 15-30 s, and persisting for up to 6 h. Both hormones showed a dose-dependent activation of each isoenzyme in both cell types, but the patterns of response differed. Parathyroid hormone predominantly stimulated isoenzyme I in the clonal osteogenic sarcoma cells but showed equivalent activation of each isoenzyme in calvarial cells. Prostaglandin E2 also predominantly stimulated isoenzyme I in the malignant cells, whereas in the calvarial strain there was a major effect on isoenzyme II with almost no stimulation of isoenzyme I. Half-maximal stimulation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in the malignant cell strain was achieved for both hormones at concentrations an order of magnitude lower than those in the normal strain. These studies demonstrate selective activation of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase isoenzymes by hormones. Furthermore, the nature of the response differs between the normal and the corresponding neoplastic cell types for the same hormone stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2071419747,"α-Factor, a tridecapeptide mating pheromone of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), has extensive sequence homology with the hypothalamic decapeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Both synthetic and natural preparations of α-mating factor were found to bind specifically to rat pituitary GnRH receptors and to stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone from cultured gonadotrophs. The ability of the yeast pheromone to reproduce the biological actions of GnRH in the mammalian pituitary gland indicates that the structural and functional properties of GnRH-related peptides may have been highly conserved during evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2086305581,"Simian sarcoma virus (SSV) deletion mutants were constructed from a molecular clone containing the entire infectious provirus. Transfection analysis of these mutants localized the SSV transforming gene to a small region of the viral genome encompassing its cell-derived sequence (v-sis). Antiserum to a peptide synthesized on the basis of the predicted amino acid sequence of the SSV transforming gene detected a 28,000-dalton protein that was specifically expressed in SSV transformed cells and that corresponded in size to that predicted from the v-sis coding sequence. The v-sis gene product designated p28sis was not a phosphoprotein, nor did it possess detectable protein kinase activity. These findings distinguish p28sis from a number of other retroviral onc proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1547101270,"Cathepsin G, an Mr = 26,000-29,000 cationic human neutrophil lysosomal serine protease, releases angiotensin II from angiotensinogen and was, therefore, examined for angiotensin I-converting activity. Cathepsin G-dependent angiotensin I conversion was detected by a high performance liquid chromatography assay which permitted independent quantitation of angiotensin I and angiotensin II and detection of angiotensin degradation products. 1.8-5.0 X 10(-9) M cathepsin G converted angiotensin I (3.3 X 10(-4) M) to angiotensin II without further degradation of angiotensin II. The pH optimum for cathepsin G-catalyzed angiotensin I conversion was pH 7.0-7.5, and the Km and Kcat were 2.2 X 10(-4) M and 3.4 s-1, respectively. In contrast to dipeptidyl hydrolase-converting enzyme, cathepsin G did not inactivate bradykinin, did not cleave hippuryl-His-Leu, and was not inhibited by 10(-4) M Captopril or SQ 20881. Purified human neutrophils stimulated with 2.5 X 10(-6) M-10(-10) M fMet-Leu-Phe released angiotensin-converting activity with a Km of 3.3 X 10(-4) M. That the angiotensin-converting activity released from neutrophils was attributable to cathepsin G was indicated by similar susceptibility to inhibitors and adsorption by goat antibody to cathepsin G. The granulocyte-angiotensin system provides a mechanism for the local generation of angiotensin II at sites of neutrophil accumulation and may be of significance in regulation of blood flow in tissue microvasculature."
https://openalex.org/W1488630911,"Hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans (ATCC No. 27774) grown in unenriched and in enriched 61Ni and 57Fe media has been purified to apparent homogeneity. Two fractions of enzymes with hydrogenase activity were separated and were termed hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II. they were shown to have similar molecular weights (77,600 for hydrogenase I and 75,500 for hydrogenase II), to be composed of two polypeptide chains, and to contain Ni and non-heme iron. Because of its higher specific activity (152 versus 97) hydrogenase II was selected for EPR and Mossbauer studies. As isolated, hydrogenase II exhibits an EPR signal at g = 2.02 and a rhombic EPR signal at g = 2.3, 2.2, and 2.0. Isotopic substitution of 61Ni proves that the rhombic signal is due to Ni. Combining the Mossbauer and EPR data, the isotropic g = 2.02 EPR signal was shown to originate from a 3Fe cluster which may have oxygenous or nitrogenous ligands. In addition, the Mossbauer data also revealed two [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters iun each molecule of hydrogenase II. The EPR and Mossbauer data of hydrogenase I were found to be identical to those of hydrogenase II, indicating that both enzymes have common metallic centers."

https://openalex.org/W1585674762,"A purified cytochrome b-c1 complex isolated from yeast mitochondria has been reconstituted into proteoliposomes. The reconstituted comp]lex catalyzed antimycin A-sensitive electron transfer from different analogues of coenzyme Q to cytochrome c. The reconstituted complex was also capable of energy conservation as indicated by uncoupler-stimulated rates of electron transfer, electrogenic proton ejection, and reversed electron flow from cytochrome b to coenzyme Q2 in the presence of antimycin A driven by a valinomycin-induced K+-diffusion potential (negative inside). Close to four protons were ejected per two electrons transported through the reconstituted b-c1 complex with ferricyanide as an artificial and impermeable electron acceptor.l The H+/2e- ratio decreased to two in the presence of the proton-conducting agent, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. The same processes were studied in parallel in energy-conserving site 2 of rat liver mitochondria with similar results. In the reconstituted b-c1 complex, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) blocked the function of the electrogenic proton translocating device in the forward direction of proton ejection as well as in the backwards direction, measured as reversed electron flow from cytochrome b to coenzyme Q2 driven by a K+-diffusion potential. The primary effect of DCCD is localized on the proton ejection process, as the low proton conductance of the proteoliposome membrane was totally preserved after DCCD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1541214688,"The phosphorylation of electrophoretically homogeneous preparations of the five major subcomponents of that thymus H1 histone by growth-associated histone kinase isolated from Ehrlich ascites tumor or Novikoff hepatoma cell chromatin results in the introduction of three to six phosphates/molecule into different subcomponents. Fully phosphorylated preparations of subcomponents 1 through 4 consist of H1 molecules containing a uniform number of phosphate groups, and run as single bands in long acid-urea gels. Fully phosphorylated preparations of subcomponent 5 consist of a mixture of molecules containing five and six phosphate groups. Phosphorylation of subcomponents 2, 4, and 5 occurs in both the NH2- and carboxyl-terminal regions of the molecules. Phosphorylation of subcomponents 1 and 3 occurs only in the carboxyl-terminal region. The central globular region of the histones is not phosphorylated. The major sites of phosphorylation in rat H1 histone subcomponents are similar to, but not entirely identical with, the major sites of phosphorylation previously characterized in total calf thymus H1, as determined by comparison of phosphopeptide maps. Highly phosphorylated rat H1 molecules, similar in phosphate content to those found in mitotic cells, have distinct chromatographic properties, compared to lightly phosphorylated molecules of the type found in interphase cells. This change in chromatographic properties appears to depend on the number of phosphate groups present in the histone rather than on the presence of phosphate in any specific sites."
https://openalex.org/W1563691568,"Fibrinogen binds to human platelets after specific receptor sites are exposed by thrombin, ADP, epinephrine, and other stimuli. Since prostaglandin I2 (PGI2), a potent activator of platelet adenylate cyclase, prevents mobilization of the fibrinogen receptor by aggregating agents, we investigated the relationship between platelet cAMP levels and fibrinogen receptor status in thrombin-stimulated human platelets. A dose-dependent rise in platelet cAMP in response to two adenylate cyclase agonists, PGI2 and forskolin, correlated with progressive inhibition of fibrinogen binding. Moreover, the receptor inhibition produced by either agonist was sustained up to 2 h and was associated with a persistent increase in cAMP levels. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, in the presence of a subthreshold concentration of PGI2 also raised cAMP and inhibited fibrinogen binding. In contrast, the effects of PGI2 on both cAMP and fibrinogen binding were markedly attenuated by 9-(tetrahydro-2-furyl) adenine, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor. These results indicate that the inhibition of fibrinogen binding by PgI2 is linked to its effect on cAMP levels and suggest that elevation of platelet cAMP levels from any cause prevents exposure of the fibrinogen receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1511407237,"We have studied the spatial relationship between cytochromes a and a3 by the enhancement of the spin relaxation of cytochrome a3-NO EPR signals by the paramagnetic a heme at 15 K. An Fe-Fe distance of 12-19A is estimated from the absence of dipolar broadening and from the observation of spin relaxation enhancement in the a3-NO complex. When this result is combined with resonance x-ray diffraction data reported by Blasie et al. (Blasie, J. K., Pachence, J. M., Tavormina, A., Dutton, P. L., Stamatoff, J., Eisenberger, P., and Brown, G. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 679, 188-197) and the contribution from the exchange interaction is considered, we can limit the iron-iron distance to 12-16 A and estimate the angle between the Fe-Fe vector and mitochondrial membrane normal as 30-60 degrees. We also consider the possible effects of CuA on cytochrome a3-NO."
https://openalex.org/W1583913027,"The effect of N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (Bt2cAMP) on the induction of the mRNA coding for the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was examined in H4-II-E cells. this mRNA comprised about 0.1% of total cellular poly(A)+RNA activity in uninduced cells and was increased 5- to 7-fold by the cyclic nucleotide. The maximal level was reached 3 h after addition of the nucleotide to the cell culture. This induction is attributed to cAMP since the nonmetabolizable analogs 8-bromocAMP and 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)cAMP produce inductions comparable to Bt2cAMP while sodium butyrate and dibutyryl cyclic GMP had little effect. The increased translational activity correlated well with a proportionate increase in the amount of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase) mRNA sequences which were hybridizable to a specific cDNA probe. Blot hybridization of total nuclear RNA isolated from uninduced H4-II-E cells revealed eight P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase RNA sequence species ranging in size from 1.8 to 6.9 kilobases. Treatment with Bt2cAMP increased the amount of all eight of these forms. This increase became maximal by 45-60 min and was maintained for at least 1 h. In contrast, analysis of cytoplasmic RNA showed a single 3.2-kilobase (23 S) band, which was still increasing in amount 2 h after Bt2cAMP treatment. Thus, Bt2cAMP resulted in a sequential induction of nuclear P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase RNA sequences followed by an increase in cytoplasmic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA. We conclude that cyclic AMP exerts its main effect on P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase induction at the nuclear level."
https://openalex.org/W1538972797,"Diacylglycerol was generated in vitro in rat lung microsomes by forming phosphatidic acid via sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase followed by the hydrolysis of the phosphatidic acid by phosphatidate phosphohydrolase. Diacylglycerol concentrations of 35 to 50 nmol/mg of microsomal protein were obtained. Cholinephosphotransferase activity was determined in microsomes by measuring the conversion of endogenously generated [14C]diacylglycerol to phosphatidylcholine. Reaction rates of 14 to 16 nmol/min/mg of protein were obtained with a 30-s reaction. Diacylglycerol which was primarily dipalmitoylglycerol was produced when palmitic acid was used in the sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase reactions. Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine was formed via cholinephosphotransferase from the dipalmitoylglycerol with an apparent maximal velocity of 20 nmol/min/mg of protein. When oleic acid was used instead of palmitic acid, the apparent maximal velocity for cholinephosphotransferase was 26 nmol/min/mg of protein. The apparent Km values for the two different diacylglycerol substrates were the same (28.5 nmol/mg of protein). Diacylglycerols, with different molecular species composition, were generated using a variety of fatty acids and fatty acid mixtures. The phosphatidylcholine formed from these diacylglycerols had the same molecular species profiles as the diacylglycerol used as the substrate. The relative reaction rates with the different diacylglycerols were essentially the same except when 20:4 and 22:6 fatty acids were used individually, in which case the rates were lower. We conclude that cholinephosphotransferase readily forms dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine from endogenously generated dipalmitoylglycerol and that the cholinephosphotransferase reaction is generally nonselective for the diacylglycerol substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1965212866,"A 311-base pair fragment containing the SV40 origin of replication was linked to the chicken thymidine kinase gene on a recombinant plasmid. This molecule was transfected into human 143 thymidine kinase-deficient (TK-) cells, and colonies positive for thymidine kinase were selected. When cell lines derived from these colonies were fused to permissive simian cells that produce SV40 T antigen, the recombinant plasmid excised itself from the human cellular genome and replicated with a high copy number per cell. These results show that this segment of the viral genome is the only sequence required in cis to mediate SV40 excision and replication upon fusion to permissive cells. In addition, we have shown that excised plasmids apparently identical to the input DNA can be efficiently rescued in Escherichia coli. SV40 excision and replication may therefore be useful for the recovery of cloned genes from eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533093430,"The influence of streptozotocin diabetes, glucose, and insulin on the metabolism of basement membrane collagen and proteoglycan was studied in the murine EHS tumor. No differences were found in the amino acid composition of tumors grown in diabetic and control mice, suggesting that the relative amount of collagen was not increased. Similarly, no significant differences were observed in any of the intracellular enzyme activities of collagen biosynthesis in the tumor tissue, but in diabetic mice, a significant increase was found in all four enzyme activities studied in the kidneys. High glucose concentrations increased total protein synthesis of the tumor tissue in vitro whereas insulin had no effect. Basement membrane collagen synthesis was also increased but to the same extent as protein synthesis in general. No qualitative changes were found in the pro-alpha 1(IV) and pro-alpha 2(IV) chains synthesized in vitro with or without insulin at different glucose concentrations. Hyperglycemia secondary to insulin deficiency may thus be responsible for the basement membrane thickening in diabetes but this cannot explain the relative increase in collagen content of these matrices. The incorporation of 35SO4 into proteoglycan in vitro was likewise increased at high glucose concentrations, indicating that the synthesis of this component may also be altered in diabetes."

https://openalex.org/W1525223486,"3T3-L1 preadipocytes, when treated with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin, differentiate into cells with the morphological and biochemical properties of adipocytes; the closely related 3T3-C2 cells, under identical conditions, exhibit a low frequency of adipocyte conversion. During differentiation, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes acquire an increased responsiveness to certain agonists (e.g. isoproterenol and adrenocorticotropic hormone) that influence lipolysis and lipogenesis through activation of adenylate cyclase, whereas 3T3-C2 cells do not. It has been suggested that changes in hormone responsiveness of 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation result from increased amounts of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein of adenylate cyclase, as demonstrated by choleragen-catalyzed [32P]ADP ribosylation of 42 and 49-50-kilodalton particulate peptides. Particulate fractions from nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells, like those from 3T3-L1 cells, contained choleragen substrates of 42 and 46-47 (doublet) kilodaltons. Incubation of intact 3T3-L1 or 3T3-C2 cells with choleragen prior to preparation of particulate fractions prevented the subsequent in vitro choleragen-dependent [32P]ADP ribosylation of only these peptides. Increased incorporation of radioactivity into both the 42 and 46-47-kilodalton peptides was observed during differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. However, a similar increase was also observed in nondifferentiating 3T3-C2 cells subjected to the differentiation protocol. Therefore, increased hormone responsiveness of 3T3-L1 adipocytes cannot be explained solely on the basis of increased labeling, and perhaps increased amounts, of the guanyl nucleotide-binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W90710844,"The stereochemical configuration of the Mn(II) . ADP complex at the active site of creatine kinase has been elucidated by EPR using chirally labeled [alpha-17O]ADP. Superhyperfine coupling between the 17O nucleus and Mn(II) produces a characteristic inhomogeneous broadening of the EPR signals for Mn(II) whenever the 17O is in the first coordination sphere of the metal ion. Previous experiments with ADP regio-specifically labeled with 17O in the phosphate groups had shown that Mn(II) was coordinated to the alpha and beta positions of ADP in transition state analog complexes with creatine kinase that involved enzyme, Mn(II), ADP, creatine, and anions such as formate and thiocyanate (Reed, G. H., and Leyh, T. S. (1980) Biochemistry 19, 5472-5480). The present experiments were initiated to determine the stereochemical configuration of the Mn(II) . ADP complex at the active site of the enzyme. EPR spectra for Mn(II) in transition state analog complexes with formate, thiocyanate, and nitrate as the stabilizing anions show inhomogeneous broadening from 17O in Sp [alpha-17O]ADP whereas the spectra obtained with Rp [alpha-17O]ADP are indistinguishable from those for matched samples with unlabeled ADP. The precision of the measurements indicates that the stereoselectivity of the enzyme for the delta configuration of the alpha, beta chelate of Mn(II) . ADP is greater than 15:1. The delta configuration is also preferred in fully active enzymic complexes involving the equilibrium mixture of substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1651809995,"Primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes incubated (24-72 h) in Waymouth's 752/1 medium, exhibited a marked decline (80-90%) in their ability to incorporate 0.5 mM [1,3-14C]glycerol and 1.0 mM palmitate into glycerolipids. The specific activities of glycerol kinase and sn-glycerol-3-P acyltransferase also showed a time-dependent reduction (30-80%). Phosphatidate phosphohydrolase, diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, and fatty acid-CoA ligase activities were unaffected. Insulin and/or glucagon (10(-8) to 10(-6) M) not only prevented these reductions in hepatocyte monolayer glycerolipid formation and enzyme activities but increased (2-5-fold) the level of these processes. Cycloheximide (1 microM) reduced the insulin- and glucagon-dependent increases in sn-glycerol-3-P acyltransferase and glycerol kinase activity and glycerolipid biosynthesis. There was an excellent correlation (r greater than 0.93) between changes in glycerol kinase and sn-glycerol-3-P acyltransferase activity and the capacity of hepatocyte monolayers to incorporate labeled glycerol into glycerolipids under all conditions studied. Therefore, insulin and glucagon may regulate hepatic glycerolipid biosynthesis in part by maintaining the liver cell's enzymatic rate of glycerolipid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1489152758,"A new vitamin D3 metabolite was isolated in pure form (18.2 micrograms) from the serum of rats given large doses (two doses of 26 mumol/rat) of vitamin D3.

The stereochemical configuration at the C-23 and c-25 positions of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26-23-peroxylactone was definitely determined to be the 23(S)25(R),25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-peroxylactone is suggested for this metabolite. The isolation involved chloroform-methanol extraction and four column chromatographic procedures. The metabolite purification and elution position on these columns were followed by UV measurement at 264 nm. This metabolite was ultimately resolved from the previously known 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Zorbax Sil column. The 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-peroxylactone was converted upon storage at room temperature or -20 degrees C into the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-lactone. Since under the conditions of this isolation only the 26,23-peroxylactone and no 26,23-lactone of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was present in the rat serum, this suggests that the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3-26,23-peroxylactone is the naturally occurring metabolite."

At gpD5 concentration below the saturation value in a low ionic strength buffer, DNA distribution is bimodal, indicating cooperative binding of gpD5 to DNA. However, in the presence of 10 mM MgCl2, the binding process becomes distributive, with the buoyant density increasing linearly with the amount of gpD5 added until the saturation. From these data, one molecule of gpD5 is calculated to cover 40 base pairs at saturation. The technique as described has general applicability to the study of any interaction between DNA and dNA-binding proteins that bind in sufficient amount to cause detectable changes in buoyant density."
