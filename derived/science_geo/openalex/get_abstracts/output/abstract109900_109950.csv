https://openalex.org/W2077425788,"Transgenic mice were created with cardiac-specific overexpression of the β2-adrenergic receptor. This resulted in increased basal myocardial adenylyl cyclase activity, enhanced atrial contractility, and increased left ventricular function in vivo; these parameters at baseline in the transgenic animals were equal to those observed in control animals maximally stimulated with isoproterenol. These results illustrate a useful approach for studying the effect of gene expression on cardiac contractility. Because chronic heart failure in humans is accompanied by a reduction in the number of myocardial β-adrenergic receptors and in inotropic responsiveness, these results suggest a potential gene therapy approach to this disease state."

https://openalex.org/W2094360518,"Using a polyclonal antibody against postnatal cerebellar cells, we have isolated a new, brain-specific member of the lipid-binding protein family (BLBP). Members of this family, such as cellular retinoic acid-binding protein, have been shown to carry small hydrophobic signaling molecules between cellular compartments. The expression of BLBP is spatially and temporally correlated with neuronal differentiation in many parts of the mouse CNS, including postnatal cerebellum, embryonic spinal cord, and cerebral cortex. In situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry show that BLBP is transiently expressed in radial glia in both the embryonic ventricular zone and the postnatal cerebellum. Subcellular localization studies by immunoelectron microscopy demonstrate that BLBP is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm. Affinity-purified anti-BLBP antibodies block glial and neuronal differentiation in primary cell cultures, but have no effect on cell proliferation or adhesion. Based on these results, we propose that BLBP is required for the establishment of the radial glial fiber system in developing brain, a system that is necessary for the migration of immature neurons to establish cortical layers."

https://openalex.org/W2091064926,"In mice with targeted disruption of the gene that encodes interleukin-6 (IL-6), greatly reduced numbers of immunoglobulin A (IgA)-producing cells were observed at mucosae and grossly deficient local antibody responses were recorded after mucosal challenge with either ovalbumin or vaccinia virus. The IgA response in the lungs was completely restored after intranasal infection with recombinant vaccinia viruses engineered to express IL-6. These findings demonstrate a critical role for IL-6 in vivo in the development of local IgA antibody responses and illustrate the effectiveness of vector-directed cytokine gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1536031017,"Prostanoids, produced by diverse cell types, modulate a variety of pathophysiological processes. The rate of prostanoid synthesis is determined, in part, by the levels of prostanoid-synthetic enzymes, such as cyclooxygenase (Cox), a rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostanoids. While two Cox genes have been identified, Cox-2 is unique because it is highly induced in response to cell activation processes including inflammation. We have studied the effect of interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), a proinflammatory cytokine that facilitates its actions in part by inducing the synthesis of prostanoids, on the expression of Cox-2 in a human cell line (ECV304) and demonstrated that IL-1 alpha induces a sustained increase in the expression of the Cox-2 mRNA as well as the functional enzyme. Three mechanistically distinct inhibitors of translation stimulated the expression of the Cox-2 mRNA and potentiated the effect of IL-1 alpha. Furthermore, IL-1 alpha induced rapid but transient activation of Cox-2 transcription and, in the absence of transcription, prolonged the half-life of the Cox-2 mRNA. Together, these data suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms are important in the sustained induction of the Cox-2 mRNA and that IL-1 alpha may increase the stability of the Cox-2 transcript."

https://openalex.org/W2077146968,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is an autosomal dominant condition with characteristic skin lesions, mental handicap, seizures and the development of hamartomas in the brain, heart, kidneys and other organs. Linkage studies have shown locus heterogeneity with a TSC gene mapped to chromosome 9q34 and a second, recently identified on 16p13.3. We have analysed DNA markers in eight hamartomas and one tumour from TSC patients and found allele loss on 16p13.3 in three angiomyolipomas, one cardiac rhabdomyoma, one cortical tuber and one giant cell astrocytoma. We suggest that the TSC gene on 16p13.3 functions like a tumour suppressor gene, in accordance with Knudsen's hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2080673872,"Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis begins with an asymmetric cell division, producing a smaller prespore and a larger mother cell, both of which contain intact copies of the chromosome. The spoIIIE gene is required for chromosome segregation into the prespore compartment. The effects of the spoIIIE36 mutation on sigma F-dependent transcription are an indirect consequence of the failure of certain genes to enter the cellular compartment in which their transcription factor has become active. SpoIIIE may also be required to prevent sigma F from becoming active in the mother cell."
https://openalex.org/W1972459374,"We studied the kinetics of recovery from inactivation of voltage-dependent Na+ channels in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons. Recovery proceeded exponentially after an initial delay and was accompanied by a tiny ionic current. Both the delay and the time constant of recovery became shorter with increasing hyperpolarization. Negative to -170 mV, the rate of recovery saturated at approximately 4 ms-1 (22 degrees C). Recovery from block by the anticonvulsant drug diphenylhydantoin was far slower, but the pattern of voltage dependence was very similar. Our results suggest that, analogous to the coupling between Na+ channel activation and the development of inactivation, recovery from inactivation is coupled to channel deactivation. Such coupling ensures very little ""leak"" Na+ current during recovery and a highly voltage-sensitive repriming of Na+ channels for the next impulse."
https://openalex.org/W2069538091,"The primate visual system is often divided into two channels, designated M and P, whose signals are relayed to the cerebral cortex by neurons in the magnocellular and parvicellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. We have identified a third population of geniculocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of macaques, which is immunoreactive for the α subunit of type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. This large third population occupies interlaminar regions (intercalated layers) ventral to each principal layer. Retrograde labeling of kinase-immunoreactive cells from the primary visual cortex shows that they provide the geniculocortical input to cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs in layers II and III."
https://openalex.org/W2050529989,"We have studied permeation at a cloned rat 5-HT transporter expressed in Xenopus oocytes. [3H]5-HT uptake and [125I]RTI-55 binding yield a turnover rate of approximately 1/s that does not depend on membrane potential. However, in voltage-clamp experiments, three distinct currents results from 5-HT transporter expression. First, a steady-state, voltage-dependent transport-associated current is induced by 5-HT application. Second, a transient inward current is activated by voltage jumps to high negative potentials in the absence of 5-HT and is blocked by 5-HT itself. Third, a small leakage current is observed in the absence of 5-HT. All the observed currents are blocked by inhibitors of 5-HT uptake but are differentially affected by Na+, Li+, K+, Ba2+, Cs+, Cl-, and amiloride. The conducting states of the 5-HT transporter may reflect the existence of a permeation pathway similar to that of ionic channels."

https://openalex.org/W1969909813,"Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (18-20 bases) to a cloned delta opioid receptor (DOR-1) lower delta binding in NG108-15 cells by 40%-50%. Changing 4 bases to generate a mismatch antisense oligodeoxynucleotide or mixing the corresponding sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides prior to treatment of the cells eliminates the inhibition of binding, confirming the specificity of the response. In vivo, an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to DOR-1 given intrathecally lowers delta, but not mu or kappa 1 spinal analgesia. The mismatch antisense oligodeoxynucleotide is inactive. Delta analgesic sensitivity gradually returns by 5 days after the last antisense treatment, indicating the lack of irreversible damage or toxicity. These studies demonstrate that DOR-1 mediates delta analgesia at the level of the spinal cord and confirm at the molecular level traditional pharmacological studies implying distinct receptor mechanisms for delta, mu, and kappa 1 analgesia. The use of antisense approaches may prove valuable in understanding the receptors mediating opioid pharmacology."

https://openalex.org/W1974022934,"Cloning of cDNAs that code for GABAA receptor subunits has revealed multiple receptor populations constructed from different subunit combinations. On native rat and cloned human GABAA receptors, the anticonvulsant compound loreclezole strongly potentiated GABA-mediated chloride currents. Using different combinations of human GABAA receptor subunits expressed in Xenopus oocytes and transfected 293 cells, loreclezole was highly selective for receptors containing the β2 or β3 subunit over those containing the β1 subunit. Loreclezole was demonstrated to act at a site distinct from the benzodiazepine, barbiturate, and steroid sites with a unique subunit dependence. These results describe a previously unidentified modulatory site on the GABAA receptor β subunit that allows pharmacological discrimination of different GABAA receptor subpopulations in the brain and provides a new target for putative anticonvulsant/anxiolytic drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2042603409,"Dynamic rearrangements of axon terminal arbors may be critical for establishing appropriate connections in the developing nervous system. Here, the changes in complex retinal axon arbors in the tecta of live Xenopus larvae were followed during the formation of the topographic retinotectal projection. Three-dimensional reconstructions of terminal arbors made with a confocal microscope at hourly intervals revealed rapid remodeling of arbor extensions. Shorter branches were extended and retracted very rapidly, suggesting that they probe the environment for the optimal sites to form stable branches. About 27% of longer branches were present throughout the entire observation period and may be sites of stabilized synaptic contacts. Treatment of the animals to block postsynaptic activity resulted in increased rates of arbor rearrangements, which may coincide with decreased synapse stability. These studies reveal the dynamic behavior of nerve arbors and provide estimates for the lifetimes of retinotectal branches."
https://openalex.org/W1596666097,"Retinoid-like receptors play a central role in hormonal responses by forming heterodimers with other nuclear hormone receptors. In this study we have identified the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) as a new thyroid hormone receptor (THR) auxiliary nuclear protein, heterodimerizing with THR in solution. Although these heterodimers do not recognize a classical thyroid hormone response element (TRE) characterized by direct repeat separated by four nucleotides (DR+4), PPAR behaves as a dominant negative regulator of thyroid hormone (TH) action. However, a TH-dependent positive effect is elicited by selective interaction of the THR beta-PPAR but not the THR alpha-PPAR heterodimer with a novel TRE (DR+2). The critical region of THR beta was mapped to 3 amino acids in the distal box of the DNA binding domain. Hence, PPAR can positively or negatively influence TH action depending on TRE structure and THR isotype."
https://openalex.org/W1517639918,"Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase comprise a redox system ubiquitous in all organisms. To better understand the thiol chemistry of the mammalian thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase redox system, mutants of human thioredoxin were produced by site-directed mutagenesis in which the two active site cysteines were replaced by serine residues, individually (C32S and C35S) and in combination (C32S/C35S). C35S and C32S/C35S were found to be competitive inhibitors of the reduction of human thioredoxin by human thioredoxin reductase with Ki values of 1.8 and 6.7 microM, respectively. C32S did not inhibit thioredoxin reductase, apparently due to aggregation of the oxidized C32S species. Examination of the three mutant forms of thioredoxin by circular dichroism spectroscopy indicated that there were significant differences in the secondary structures when compared with thioredoxin. There were detectable changes in the circular dichroism spectra when thioredoxin, C35S, and C32S/C35S were bound to thioredoxin reductase, whereas C32S with thioredoxin reductase underwent only a small spectral change. Recombinant human thioredoxin stimulated DNA synthesis and the proliferation of murine fibroblasts. The ability of thioredoxin to stimulate cell proliferation could not be duplicated by either dithiothreitol or glutathione. C32S, C35S, and C32S/C35S failed to stimulate cell proliferation, showing that the redox active form of thioredoxin is necessary for eliciting growth stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1997841263,"Two distinct physiological mechanisms underlying loudness sensation were inferred from electric stimulation of the human auditory nerve and brainstem. In contrast to a power function relating loudness and stimulus intensity in acoustic hearing, loudness in electric stimulation of the auditory nerve depends on stimulus frequency. Loudness is an exponential function of electric amplitude for high frequencies and is a power function for low frequencies. A frequency-dependent, two-stage model is suggested to explain the loudness function, in which the first stage of processing is performed by a mechanical mechanism in the cochlea for high-frequency stimuli and by a neural mechanism in the cochlear nucleus for low-frequency stimuli."

https://openalex.org/W2088682178,"Alternative splicing generates distinct forms of the NMDA receptor subunit NR1. NR1 subunits with an N-terminal insert (termed N1) form receptors in Xenopus oocytes with greatly reduced potentiation by spermine and Zn2+. Oocytes expressing NR1 receptors with N1 exhibited larger NMDA currents than oocytes expressing corresponding receptors without N1. In the present study, we used mutational analysis to investigate structural features of the N1 insert that control current amplitude and spermine and Zn2+ potentiation. Neutralization of positive charges in N1 rescued spermine and Zn2+ potentiation. Positive charges in N1 did not affect spermine or Zn2+ affinity. Neutralization of positive charges in N1 diminished the responses to the level of NR1 receptors lacking N1. The positively charged N1 may increase NMDA currents by causing a conformational change similar to that produced by spermine and Zn2+ in NR1 receptors lacking N1."
https://openalex.org/W1983704513,"Gating currents provide a direct record of the spatial rearrangement of charges occurring within the protein of voltage-sensitive ion channels. If the elementary charges move as very brief discrete pulses of current, they will produce fluctuations in the macroscopic gating current. The variance of such fluctuations in gating currents was measured in Shaker potassium channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes with a sufficiently high recording bandwidth to estimate the magnitude and time distribution of the elementary transition charge movements. Channel activation occurred in two sequential stages. The first stage consisted of numerous, fast transitions, each moving small amounts of charge that contributed little to the fluctuation in gating current, whereas the second stage, which contributed the bulk of the fluctuation, was represented by a number of discrete, correlated transitions, one or more of which carried a charge of at least 2.4 elementary charges across the membrane field."
https://openalex.org/W2072188162,"Gicerin is an integral membrane glycoprotein of about 82 kd that is transiently expressed in the developing CNS. Gicerin was first identified as a binding protein for neurite outgrowth factor (NOF), a member of the laminin family of extracellular matrix proteins. By isolating and sequencing a gicerin cDNA, we have found that this protein is a novel member of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The deduced protein (584 amino acids) consists of five immunoglobulin-like loop structures in an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane region, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Cells transfected stably with gicerin cDNA adhered to NOF and aggregated with each other, indicating that gicerin exhibits both heterophilic and homophilic adhesion activities."
https://openalex.org/W1977153665,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) density at the neuromuscular junction of frog cutaneous pectoris muscle was determined by electron microscope autoradiography and biochemistry to be approximately 600 sites micron-2 of postsynaptic area, approximately 4-fold lower than all previous reports (mouse), whereas the hydrolytic turnover number was 9,500 s-1, well within the range (2,000-16,000 s-1) for AChE from other species. Monte Carlo computer simulations of miniature endplate currents showed that for vertebrate neuromuscular junctions with different morphologies, an AChE density of only approximately 400 sites microns-2 and a turnover number of only approximately 1,000 s-1 are sufficient for normal quantal currents. Above these critical lower limits, miniature endplate currents were essentially insensitive to AChE density and turnover number values up to 5,000 sites microns-2 and 16,000 s-1, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1998493493,"To determine whether G proteins activate cardiac ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels by regulating intracellular ATP (ATPi)-dependent gating, currents were measured in inside-out patches. When ATPi closed KATP channels, activators of endogenous G proteins, GTP (plus adenosine or acetylcholine), GTP gamma S, or AlF-4 stimulated channels, an effect prevented by GDP beta S. In the absence of ATPi, G protein activators were ineffective. Intracellular nucleoside diphosphates restored KATP channel openings after the ""rundown"" of spontaneous activity. Only when ATPi suppressed nucleoside diphosphate-induced openings, GTP gamma S or AlF-4 enhanced KATP channel activity. Active forms of exogenous G protein subunits (G alpha i-1, G alpha i-2, or G alpha o) activated only KATP channels closed by ATPi. G proteins stimulate cardiac KATP channels apparently by antagonizing ATPi-dependent inhibitory gating. Regulation of ligand-dependent gating represents a distinct type of G protein modulation of ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W2090390636,"Alternative splicing results in production of four agrin proteins (agrin0, agrin8, agrin11, and agrin19) with different AChR aggregating activities. However, the cellular origin of mRNAs encoding each agrin isoform remains unknown. Using single-cell PCR, we demonstrate that in the chick ciliary ganglion, nonneuronal cells express only mRNA encoding agrin0, whereas neurons express one or any combination of agrin mRNAs. Moreover, significant differences were observed between the agrin mRNA profiles of ciliary and choroid neurons in the ganglion. The abundance of each agrin mRNA, the fraction of neurons expressing each transcript, and the combinations of transcripts expressed by neurons also change during development. Our results demonstrate that transcripts encoding agrin proteins with high AChR aggregating activity are expressed exclusively by neurons in the ciliary ganglion and that alternative splicing of agrin mRNA is regulated during development and in a cell-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2115597837,"Embryonic rat sympathetic neurons undergo programmed cell death upon NGF deprivation. We show that during postnatal development, these neurons acquire the ability to be supported in vitro by LIF and CNTF as well as NGF. LIF and CNTF do not promote the long-term survival of embryonic day 21 sympathetic neurons in vitro. However, after 5 days of culture in the presence of NGF, the majority of embryonic day 21 sympathetic neurons can be supported by either of these factors. Furthermore, postnatal day 6 sympathetic neurons can be immediately supported by LIF and CNTF, indicating that acquisition of survival responsiveness occurs in vivo as well as in vitro. During this period, neuronal expression of LIF and CNTF receptor mRNAs remains constant, suggesting that sympathetic neurons alter their responsiveness to LIF and CNTF by allowing additional intracellular signaling pathways to promote survival."

(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19819-19825), was purified to near homogeneity by three successive chromatographic runs with calmodulin-, concanavalin A-, and heparin-Sepharose columns from microsomes solubilized with Triton X-100. The purified protein was found to bind inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) in a specific, heparin-inhibitable manner with a Kd of 2.0 nM and Bmax of 450 pmol/mg protein (the binding of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate was much weaker). In sedimentation experiments on a linear sucrose density gradient the InsP3 binding activity was always with the 240-kDa protein. Protein kinase G phosphorylated the InsP3 receptor purified from the rat cerebellum as well as the 240-kDa protein. Sialic acid content of the protein measured with Limulus polyphemus agglutinin was not significantly different from that of the cerebellar InsP3 receptor. Thus, 240-kDa protein closely resembles InsP3 receptor and may be a type of InsP3 receptor. The only difference was the behavior on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 240-kDa protein presented itself as two polypeptides with similar but slightly differing M(r) values, both of which were phosphorylated by protein kinase G."
https://openalex.org/W1577761905,"The active state of the small subunit, protein R2, of ribonucleotide reductase is formed by the reaction of apoprotein with Fe2+ and O2, whereby the diferric site and a stable phenoxy free radical on a tyrosyl residue (Tyr122) is formed. The corresponding reaction was studied in the mutant Y122F R2. It leads to a normal iron site, but the reduction equivalent from Tyr122 now has to be supplied from elsewhere. EPR spectroscopy shows formation of several paramagnetic species on different time scales. Using apoprotein with deuterium-labeled tryptophan residues, at least two species could be assigned to tryptophan free radicals. This is the first EPR observation of relatively stable protein-linked tryptophan radicals at room temperature and at 77 K. These tryptophan radicals may be involved as redox intermediates in long range electron transfer within the protein structure."
https://openalex.org/W2042067315,"We have cloned four members of the family of subtilisin-like endoproteases expressed in the bag cell neurons of Aplysia and have demonstrated that two of these enzymes are capable of correctly cleaving the egg-laying hormone precursor. The egg-laying hormone precursor undergoes an ordered series of cleavages, such that different peptides are differentially sorted into distinct secretory vesicles. We have used electron microscopic chemistry to demonstrate that at least one processing enzyme is differentially segregated into a class of secretory vesicles containing the bag cell peptides. The segregation of specific endoproteases, along with specific neuropeptides within a given cell type, may ensure appropriate cleavage and prevent inappropriate cleavage of the polyprotein precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1602977832,"The rat D2 dopamine receptor gene is transcribed from a TATA-less promoter that has an initiator-like sequence and several putative Sp1 binding sites. The main activator of this gene is between nucleotides -75 and -29, and a strong negative modulator is located between bases -217 and -76 (Minowa, T., Minowa, M. T., and Mouradian, M. M. (1992) Biochemistry 31, 8389-8396). In the present investigation, a small deletion series within this negative modulator fused with the reporter gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was used to transfect the D2-expressing cells, NB41A3. Two cis-acting functional DNA sequences were identified: a 41-base pair segment between nucleotides -116 and -76 (D2Neg-B), which decreased transcription from the D2 promoter by about 45%, and a 26-base pair segment between nucleotides -160 and -135 (D2Neg-A), which, in the presence of the downstream negative modulator, reduced transcription down to the level of a promoterless vector. DNase I footprinting, gel mobility shift, and competitive cotransfection experiments suggested that D2Neg-A functions without trans-acting factors, whereas D2Neg-B interacts with nuclear factors at its Sp1 binding sequences. Gel supershift with anti-Sp1 antibody and UV cross-linking experiments revealed that a novel 130-kDa factor as well as Sp1 interact with D2Neg-B in NB41A3 cells. This novel protein recognizing Sp1 binding sequences in the D2 gene negative modulator is also found in nuclear extract from the rat striatum."
https://openalex.org/W1492297064,"The receptor for neuromedin B (NMB-R), a mammalian bombesin-related peptide, is widely distributed in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. While it is known that this receptor is coupled to phospholipase C, like many other phospholipase C-activating receptors, little is known about regulation of the NMB-R subsequent to agonist stimulation. We studied both native NMB-R on C-6 rat glioblastoma cells and wild type NMB-R cloned from rat esophageal muscle which was stably transfected into Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. Both cell types rapidly increased [3H]inositol phosphates and [Ca2+]i in response to 1 microM NMB, whereas preincubation with 3 nM NMB for 3 h markedly attenuated the ability of 1 microM NMB, but not 1 microM endothelin-1, to alter either cell type's biological activity. Prolonged exposure to 3 nM NMB caused a rapid decrease in the number of NMB-R, with the maximal receptor down-regulation seen at 24 h due to NMB-R internalization. After maximal down-regulation, removal of agonist resulted in a rapid restoration of NMB-R to the cell surface of both cell types. NMB-R recovery at 6 h was blocked by monensin, an inhibitor of receptor recycling, but was not affected by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor. Resensitization to agonist paralleled the recovery of NMB-R in both cell types, and resensitization likewise was blocked by monensin. Our data demonstrate that the NMB-R undergoes rapid homologous desensitization consequent to agonist stimulation, which is mediated by receptor down-regulation and which, in turn, is regulated by internalization. During resensitization, NMB-R reappearance on the cell surface membrane is independent of protein synthesis and is due to a recycling from an intracellular site."
https://openalex.org/W1517361341,"Recent studies have shown that the rat liver heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase is a glycoprotein encoded by a single polypeptide chain of 882 amino acids. Using radiation inactivation analyses, we have now determined that in rat liver Golgi vesicles the target size for the N-deacetylase is 88 +/- 14 kDa, whereas that of the N-sulfotransferase is 92 +/- 8 kDa. These results, together with previous biochemical and molecular cloning approaches, demonstrate that 1) in rat liver Golgi membranes there exists only on population of molecules expressing both activities, 2) the active protein in the Golgi membrane functions as a monomer, and 3) there is no evidence that a large independent protein acts as a regulator of either activity."
https://openalex.org/W1570524896,"The effects of amylin and insulin on the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase were investigated using rat diaphragms incubated with 32Pi. Muscles were incubated with insulin (200 nM) or amylin (200 nM) for 30 min before extracts were prepared. The 32P contents of the enzymes were determined after immunoprecipitation and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Amylin increased both the activity ratio (-AMP/+AMP) and the 32P content of phosphorylase by approximately 2-fold. Insulin alone was without significant effect on phosphorylase, but insulin blocked the effect of amylin on increasing the phosphorylation of phosphorylase. Insulin increased the glycogen synthase activity ratio (low glucose-6-P/high glucose-6-P) by approximately 80%. Amylin decreased this ratio from 0.14 to 0.08 and increased the phosphorylation of synthase by approximately 40%. To investigate changes in phosphorylation of different sites in the synthase, the enzyme was subjected to exhaustive proteolysis with trypsin, and 32P-labeled fragments were separated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Insulin decreased the 32P contents of sites 3(a+b+c) and 2(a+b), which appears to account for the increase in synthase activity. Amylin increased phosphorylation of sites 1a, 1b, and 3(a+b+c), but not sites 2(a+b). With insulin plus amylin, phosphorylation of none of the sites was significantly changed. The results indicate that the effects of amylin on glycogen synthase must involve more than activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, as this kinase phosphorylates site 2 and does not phosphorylate sites 3(a+b+c)."
https://openalex.org/W1536570090,"Recent studies have shown that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein, calnexin, associates with class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules early in their biosynthesis. It has been suggested that calnexin participates in the assembly of class I MHC molecules or in the retention within the ER of unassembled class I molecules. We have examined the role of phosphorylation of calnexin in its association with mouse class I MHC molecules. We show that phosphocalnexin associates with H-2Ld and H-2Db molecules but not with H-2Kb and H-2Dd molecules, although calnexin-H-2Kb association can be demonstrated. These observations are interesting in light of the fact that H-2Kb and H-2Dd molecules are transported out of the ER more rapidly than are H-2Ld and H-2Db molecules. H-2Ld and H-2Db molecules differ in amino acid sequence only in their membrane-distal alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains. Nevertheless, the affinity of phosphocalnexin for H-2Ld is greater than its affinity for H-2Db. Furthermore, H-2Db becomes endoglycosidase H-resistant more slowly in cells in which it associates with phosphocalnexin than in cells in which it does not. Ca2+ ionophore A23187 prevents association of phosphocalnexin with H-2Ld molecules in vivo but does not cause the disruption of phosphocalnexin-H-2Ld complexes after they have formed. A23187 does not prevent assembly of H-2Ld-beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-m) heterodimers. Furthermore, phosphocalnexin is found associated with H-2Ld molecules regardless of their state of assembly with beta 2-m and antigenic peptide. These results suggest that phosphocalnexin association with class I MHC molecules does not play a role in assembly of the class I MHC-beta 2-m-peptide complex nor in preventing release of unassembled class I molecules from the ER but may otherwise influence their rate of transport through the ER."
https://openalex.org/W1516415018,"This study investigates effects of ligands on thermal inactivation of the tryptophan synthase alpha and beta 2 subunits alone and in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex. Addition of pyridoxal phosphate to the apo-beta 2 subunit increases the temperature of one-half inactivation (Ti) from 52 to 77 degrees C. Ligands that promote association of the alpha and holo-beta 2 subunits markedly stabilize the more temperature-labile alpha subunit in the alpha 2 beta 2 complex from irreversible thermal denaturation. The combination of a beta 2 subunit ligand (L-serine) with an alpha subunit ligand (alpha-glycerol 3-phosphate) raises the inactivation temperature (Ti) of the alpha subunit in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex from 54 to 66 degrees C. In contrast, values of Ti for inactivation of the alpha and beta subunits in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex are more similar to respective values for the isolated alpha subunit (50 degrees C) and holo-beta 2 subunit (77 degrees C). Surprisingly, the addition of L-serine results in a larger decrease in the Ti of the beta 2 subunit in the holo-alpha 2 beta 2 complex (78 degrees C-->64 degrees C) than in Ti of the holo-beta 2 subunit alone (77 degrees C-->71 degrees C). The observation that ligands have different effects on the isolated and associated subunits provides evidence that the alpha and beta 2 subunits do not fully dissociate during thermal inactivation of the alpha 2 beta 2 complex at pH 7.8 and at approximately 0.1 ionic strength. Our results demonstrate that linkage between protein-ligand interactions and protein-protein interactions affects the conformational stability of the tryptophan synthase alpha 2 beta 2 complex."
