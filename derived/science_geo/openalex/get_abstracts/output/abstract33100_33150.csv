https://openalex.org/W2054549064,"THE p53 gene has been a constant source of fascination since its discovery nearly a decade ago1,2. Originally considered to be an oncogene, several convergent lines of research have indicated that the wild-type gene product actually functions as a tumour suppressor gene3–9. For example, expression of the neoplastic phenotype is inhibited, rather than promoted, when rat cells are transfected with the murine wild-type p53 gene together with mutant p53 genes and/or other oncogenes3,4. Moreover, in human tumours, the short arm of chromosome 17 is often deleted (reviewed in ref. 10). In colorectal cancers, the smallest common region of deletion is centred at 17pl3.1 (ref. 9); this region harbours the p53 gene, and in two tumours examined in detail, the remaining (non-deleted) p53 alleles were found to contain mutations9. This result was provocative because allelic deletion coupled with mutation of the remaining allele is a theoretical hallmark of tumour-suppressor genes11. In the present report, we have attempted to determine the generality of this observation; that is, whether tumours with allelic deletions of chromosome 17p contain mutant p53 genes in the allele that is retained. Our results suggest that (1) most tumours with such allelic deletions contain p53 point mutations resulting in amino-acid substitutions, (2) such mutations are not confined to tumours with allelic deletion, but also occur in at least some tumours that have retained both parental 17p alleles, and (3) p53 gene mutations are clustered in four 'hot-spots' which exactly coincide with the four most highly conserved regions of the gene. These results suggest that p53 mutations play a role in the development of many common human malignancies."

https://openalex.org/W2061530347,"A novel bacteriophage lambda vector system was used to express in Escherichia coli a combinatorial library of Fab fragments of the mouse antibody repertoire. The system allows rapid and easy identification of monoclonal Fab fragments in a form suitable for genetic manipulation. It was possible to generate, in 2 weeks, large numbers of monoclonal Fab fragments against a transition state analog hapten. The methods described may supersede present-day hybridoma technology and facilitate the production of catalytic and other antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2028644963,"Both C/EBP and GCN4 are sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that control gene expression. Recent evidence implicates C/EBP as a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. The C/EBP protein binds avidly to the dyad symmetric sequence 5′-ATTGCGCAAT-3′; GCN4 regulates the transcription of genes that control amino acid biosynthesis in yeast, and binds avidly to the dyad symmetric sequence 5′-ATGA(G/C)TCAT-3′. Both C/EBP and GCN4 bind DNA via the same structural motif. This motif has been predicted to be bipartite, consisting of a dimerization interface termed the ""leucine zipper"" and a DNA contact surface termed the ""basic region."" Specificity of DNA binding has been predicted to be imparted by the basic region. As a test of this hypothesis, recombinant proteins were created wherein the basic regions and leucine zippers of GCN4 and C/EBP were reciprocally exchanged. In both of the recombinant polypeptides, DNA binding specificity is shown to track with the basic region."
https://openalex.org/W2046276016,"Cyclosporin A, a cyclic fungal undecapeptide produced by Tolypocladium inflatum, is a potent immunosuppressive drug originally isolated as an antifungal antibiotic. Cyclosporin A (CsA) is widely used in humans to prevent rejection of transplanted organs such as kidney, heart, bone marrow and liver. The biochemical basis of CsA action is not known: its primary cellular target has been suggested to be calmodulin, the prolactin receptor or cyclophilin, a CsA-binding protein originally isolated from the cytosol of bovine thymocytes. Cyclophilin has been shown to be a highly conserved protein present in all eukaryotic cells tested and to be identical to peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, a novel type of enzyme that accelerates the slow refolding phase of certain proteins in vitro. We demonstrate that in the lower eukaryotes N. crassa and S. cerevisiae, cyclo philin mediates the cytotoxic CsA effect. In CsA-resistant mutants of both organisms, the cyclophilin protein is either lost completely or, if present, has lost its ability to bind CsA."

https://openalex.org/W2072523175,"Stable lymphoid cell lines expressing the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) nef gene product, p27, were established. The presence of p27 in the lymphoid cells suppressed replication of some strains of both HIV-1 and HIV-2. This observation indicates that nef could be important in the establishment of HIV latency. In contrast, fast replicating and highly cytopathic HIV-1 isolates recovered from patients with advanced disease states were not affected by the negative effect of nef present in these lymphoid cell lines. This lack of response to nef appears to constitute another viral feature that correlates with disease progression. Thus, manipulating expression of the nef gene in vivo might influence pathogenesis in the host."

https://openalex.org/W2082496555,"Granulocyte and natural killer (NK) cell Fc receptors for immunoglobulin G (CD16) differ in only a few amino acids, yet have phosphatidylinositol glycan (PIG) or polypeptide membrane anchors, respectively. Mutagenesis shows that anchoring is regulated by a serine residue near the PIG anchor attachment site in the extracellular domain. The NK cell isoform was not expressed on the surface of COS cells unless cotransfected with a subunit that was expressed in NK cells and that was identical to the gamma subunit of the high affinity IgE Fc receptor (Fc epsilon RI). However, the CD16 sequence and not expression of the gamma subunit is dominant in regulating PIG reanchoring."
https://openalex.org/W2138225904,"Dynein is a multisubunit ATPase that powers microtubule-based motility. We find that a dissociated dynein particle containing the beta heavy chain subunit translocates microtubules unidirectionally over a glass surface in the presence of ATP. However, after nucleotide hydrolysis is inhibited by vanadate, unidirectional translocation ceases, and microtubules instead undergo irregular back-and-forth motion along their longitudinal axes. Quantitative analysis reveals that this motion is due to thermal-driven diffusion, but, unlike a particle undergoing Brownian motion, the diffusion is restricted to one dimension. The properties of the diffusional movement indicate that dynein can interact with microtubules in a way that permits the latter to diffuse only along their longitudinal axes. This weak binding interaction may constitute an important intermediate state in dynein's force-generating cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1481361731,"Site-specific mutagenesis was used to investigate whether Pro160, Pro195, Pro308, Pro312, Pro803, and Pro812 play essential roles in the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase. All six prolines were substituted with alanine; and in addition, Pro308 was replaced by glycine and Pro312 by glycine as well as by leucine. Mutant cDNAs were expressed in COS-1 cells, and mutant Ca2(+)-ATPases located in the isolated microsomal fraction were examined with respect to Ca2+ uptake activity, Ca2+ dependence of phosphorylation from ATP, and the kinetic properties of the phosphoenzyme intermediates formed from both ATP and Pi. The enzymatic cycle was little affected by substitution of Pro160, Pro195, and Pro812, which are located in the cytoplasmic domain; but replacement of Pro308, Pro312, and Pro803, in the putative transmembrane helices, had a profound impact on the function of the enzyme. All mutations of Pro308 and Pro803 led to ATPases which were characterized by a reduced affinity for Ca2+. These prolines may therefore be involved in the structure of the high affinity Ca2(+)-binding sites in the enzyme. Substitution of Pro312 with alanine or glycine gave rise to mutants unable to transport Ca2+ even though their apparent affinities for Ca2+ in the phosphorylation reaction with ATP were increased. In these enzymes, the ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate was stable for at least 5 min at 0 degrees C, whereas the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate decay at a rate similar to that of the wild type. Thus, the inability to transport Ca2+ could be accounted for by a block of ADP-sensitive to ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate conformational transition. In contrast, substitution of Pro312 with leucine gave rise to a mutant enzyme that retained about 7% of the normal Ca2+ transport rate. Phosphoenzyme turnover in this mutant also occurred at a low but significant rate, suggesting that the leucine side chain can substitute to some extent for proline."
https://openalex.org/W1532750448,"Abstract Reactive disulfide compounds (RDSs) with a pyridyl ring adjacent to the S-S bond such as 2,2'-dithiodipyridine (2,2'-DTDP), 4,4'-dithiodipyridine, and N-succinimidyl 3(2-pyridyldithio)propionate (SPDP) trigger Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. They are known to specifically oxidize free SH sites via a thiol-disulfide exchange reaction with the stoichiometric production of thiopyridone. Thus, the formation of a mixed S-S bond between an accessible SH site on an SR protein and a RDS causes large increases in SR Ca2+ permeability. Reducing agents, glutathione (GSH) or dithiothreitol reverse the effect of RDSs and permit rapid re-uptake of Ca2+ by the Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. The RDSs, 2,2'-DTDP, 4,4'-dithiodipyridine and SPDP displaced [3H]ryanodine binding to the Ca2+-receptor complex at IC50 values of 7.5 +/- 0.2, 1.5 +/- 0.1, and 15.4 +/- 0.1 microM, respectively. RDSs did not alter the rapid initial phase of Ca2+ uptake by the pump, stimulated ATPase activity, and induced release from passively loaded vesicles with nonactivated pumps; thus they act at a Ca2+ release channel and not at the Ca2+, Mg2+-ATPase. Efflux rates increased in 0.25-1.0 mM [Mg2+]free then decreased in 2-5 mM [Mg2+]free. Adenine nucleotides inhibited the oxidation of SHs on SR protein by RDSs and thus reduced Ca2+ efflux rates. However, once RDSs oxidized these SH sites and opened the Ca2+ release pathway, subsequent additions of nucleotides stimulated Ca2+ efflux. In skinned fibers, 2,2'-dithiodipyridine elicited rapid twitches which were blocked by ruthenium red. These results indicate that RDSs trigger Ca2+ release from SR by oxidizing a critical SH group, and thus provide a method to covalently label the protein(s) involved in causing these changes in Ca2+ permeability."
https://openalex.org/W1924338526,"Ceruloplasmin (CP) was found to inhibit xanthine oxidase and ferritin-dependent peroxidation of phospholipid liposomes, as evidenced by decreased malondialdehyde formation. Ceruloplasmin was also shown to inhibit superoxide-mediated mobilization of iron from ferritin, in a concentration-dependent manner, as measured spectrophotometrically using the iron(II) chelator bathophenanthroline sulfonate. Ceruloplasmin failed to function as a peroxyl radical-scavenging antioxidant as evidenced by its inability to inhibit free radical-initiated peroxidation of linoleic acid, suggesting that CP inhibited lipid peroxidation by affecting the availability of ferritin-derived iron. In addition, CP scavenged xanthine oxidase-derived superoxide as measured spectrophotometrically via its effect on cytochrome c reduction. However, the extent of the superoxide scavenging of CP did not quantitatively account for its effects on iron release, suggesting that CP inhibits superoxide-dependent mobilization of ferritin iron independently of its ability to scavenge superoxide. The effects of CP and apoferritin on iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in systems containing exogenously added ferrous iron was also investigated. In the absence of apoferritin, CP exhibited a concentration-dependent prooxidant effect. However, CP-dependent, iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation was inhibited by the addition of apoferritin. Apoferritin did not function as a peroxyl radical-scavenging antioxidant but was shown to incorporate iron in the presence of CP. These data suggest that CP inhibits superoxide and ferritin-dependent lipid peroxidation largely via its ability to reincorporate reductively mobilized iron back into ferritin."
https://openalex.org/W8512482,"A fast protein liquid chromatography procedure for purification of the V-type H+-ATPase from higher plant vacuolar membrane to yield near-homogeneous enzyme with a specific activity of 20–25 µmol/mg•min is described. When precautions are taken to ensure the quantitative recovery of protein before sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the preparation is found to be constituted of seven major polypeptides of 100, 67, 55, 52, 44, 32, and 16 kDa, respectively, and two minor components of 42 and 29 kDa. The 52-, 44-, and 32-kDa polypeptides do not cross-react with antisera raised to the 67- and 55-kDa subunits of the enzyme, and two independent sample preparation procedures yield the same apparent subunit composition. The additional polypeptides are not breakdown products or aggregates of the previously identified subunits of the ATPase. The ATPase of tonoplast vesicles is subject to MgATP-dependent cold inactivation, and the conditions for inactivation are identical to those for the bovine chromaffin granule H+-ATPase (Moriyama, Y., and Nelson, N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3577–3582). Cold inactivation is accompanied by the detachment of five major polypeptides of 67, 55, 52, 44, and 32 kDa from the membrane, and all five components co-migrate with the corresponding polypeptides of the purified ATPase upon sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The 100- and 16-kDa polypeptides of the ATPase are not removed from the membrane during cold inactivation, but the latter can be purified to homogeneity by chloroform:methanol extraction of the fast protein liquid chromatographypurified enzyme. It is concluded that the tonoplast H+-ATPase is constituted of 6–7 major polypeptides organized into a peripheral sector comprising the 67-, 55-, 52-, 44-, and 32-kDa components and an integral sector consisting of the 100- and 16-kDa polypeptides. The V-type H+-ATPases from animal endomembranes and higher plant vacuolar membranes therefore have remarkably similar subunit compositions and gross topographies."
https://openalex.org/W2082768757,"Phototransduction in vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptor cells involves G protein-mediated light stimulation of cGMP hydrolysis. Enzymes of the cGMP hydrolysis cascades of rods and cones are products of different genes. Three different classes of cones in the human retina are maximally sensitive to either blue, green, or red light. Distinct opsin genes are expressed in each type of cone. The distribution of cone types in human retina was determined using anti-peptide antibodies that recognize specific amino acid sequences in green/red opsin and blue opsin. These antibodies together with an anti-peptide antibody against Tc alpha were used in double labeling experiments to demonstrate the presence of the Tc alpha peptide in all types of cones. cDNA clones corresponding to human rod and cone transducin alpha subunit (Tr alpha and Tc alpha) genes were isolated. Southern blot analyses of human genomic DNA suggest that there is only one rod T alpha gene but more than one cone T alpha gene. The multiple Tc alpha genes could be closely related genes or different Tc alpha alleles, or one could be a pseudogene."
https://openalex.org/W1591793880,"Abstract Kinetic studies of the phosphoenzyme intermediates of site-specific mutants were used to examine the role of Gly233 in the reaction mechanism of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase. When this glycine residue, which is highly conserved among cation-transporting ATPases, was replaced by valine, arginine, or glutamic acid, a complete loss of the ability to pump Ca2+ was observed. The mutant enzymes were able to form an ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate (E1P) by reaction with ATP in the presence of Ca2+, but this intermediate decayed to the ADP-insensitive form (E2P) very slowly, relative to the wild-type enzyme. The mutant phosphoenzyme intermediate remained ADP-sensitive, even when phosphorylation from ATP was performed under conditions which permitted accumulation of the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate in the wild type. The mutants were also defective in their ability to form the ADP-insensitive phosphoenzyme intermediate by phosphorylation from inorganic phosphate. In addition, they displayed a higher affinity for Ca2+ and a lower cooperativity in Ca2+ binding than did the wild-type enzyme, as measured through the phosphorylation reaction with ATP. These findings can be rationalized either in terms of a parallel shift of E1 to E2 and E1P to E2P conformational equilibria toward the E1 and E1P forms, respectively, or in terms of destabilization of the phosphoryl-protein interaction in the E2P form. The roles of 7 other residues located in the vicinity of Gly233 were also examined by mutation. Although the side chains of these residues are potential Ca2+ ligands, their replacement did not affect the Ca2+ affinity of the enzyme, suggesting the lack of a role of this region of the peptide in formation of Ca2(+)-binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W1572564124,"Fura-2 fluorescence in single rat basophilic leukemia cells was monitored to study the rise in intracellular free ionized calcium ([Ca2+]i) produced by aggregation of immunoglobulin E receptors. Repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]i were induced by antigen stimulation and were measured using digital video imaging microscopy at high time resolution. The [Ca2+]i oscillations were not dependent upon changes in the membrane potential of the cells and were observed in cells stimulated with antigen either with or without extracellular Ca2+. Transient oscillations in [Ca2+]i were also observed when calcium influx was blocked with La3+. These results suggested that during antigen stimulation of cells under normal physiological conditions, release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores makes an important contribution to the initial increase in [Ca2+]i. Oscillations in [Ca2+]i are not induced by elevating [Ca2+]i with the calcium ionophore ionomycin. Mitochondrial calcium buffering is not required for [Ca2+]i oscillations to occur. The results show that rat basophilic leukemia cells have significant stores of calcium and that release of calcium from these stores can participate in both the initial rise and the oscillations in [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2031584190,"We have analyzed the upstream promoter of the human 7SK RNA gene to determine which protein factors are involved in the transcription of this gene by RNA polymerase III. Using a reconstituted in vitro system, we show directly that octamer binding transcription factors (OTFs) are required for efficient transcription and that they interact with a series of nonconsensus OTF binding sites between positions -70 and -240. The same purified factors that stimulate RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription of the histone H2b gene (OTF-1) and an immunoglobulin light chain gene (OTF-2) also stimulate 7SK transcription by RNA polymerase III. Moreover, OTF-dependent stimulation requires a sequence between positions -48 and -65 that is homologous to the proximal sequence element of the class II snRNA genes. Our findings indicate that some transcription factors are utilized in the transcription of both class II and class III genes."
https://openalex.org/W2053949613,"Activation of spontaneously dividing T cell hybridomas induces interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, a cell cycle block, and programmed cell death. T cell hybridomas that express the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) ζ homodimer (ζ2), but not the TCR ζη heterodimer, were studied. The ζη- cells produced little or no inositol phosphates (IP) when stimulated with antigen. In most cases the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides was also impaired after stimulation with antibody to CD3, although one ζη- cell produced normal concentrations of IP. The ζη- cells slowed their growth and secreted IL-2 in response to both stimuli. However, the ζη- cells did not die after activation with antigen. Since activated thymocytes also undergo programmed cell death, these results may have important implications for the role of the ζη TCR in negative selection."
https://openalex.org/W1568473891,"Mutations of the gene encoding the α-subunit of the lysosomal enzyme, β-hexosaminidase, are the cause of Tay-Sachs disease. We previously showed that fibroblasts from one patient (WG1051) synthesized an unstable α-subunit that was smaller than normal and appeared to be trapped in an early biosynthetic compartment (Zokaeem, G., Bayleran, J., Kaplan, P., Hechtman, P., and Neufeld, E. F. (1987) Am. J. Hum. Genet. 40, 537–547). We now have identified the mutation as a deletion of cytosine at position 1510 of the coding sequence. We first determined that the structural abnormality was at the carboxyl terminus of the protein and then sequenced the corresponding regions of the cDNA and genomic DNA after amplification by the polymerase chain reaction. The frameshift mutation, which is present on both alleles, causes premature termination four codons downstream, and the loss of a very hydrophilic stretch of 22 amino acids. Expression of α-subunit cDNA with the cytosine deletion in Cos-1 cells reproduced the WG1051 phenotype, i.e. a truncated α-subunit that was retained and degraded in an early compartment, presumably the endoplasmic reticulum. Loss of the cysteine residue at position 522 was not the sole cause of instability and defective transport."
https://openalex.org/W1530840777,"Mutations in the plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase gene (PMA1) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that confer growth resistance to hygromycin B have been shown recently to cause a marked depolarization of whole cell membrane potential (Perlin, D. S., Brown, C. L., and Haber, J. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18118-18122). In this report, the biochemical and genetic properties of H+-ATPases from four prominent hygromycin B-resistant pma1 mutants, pma1-105, pma1-114, pma1-147, and pma1-155, are described. Single base pair changes were identified in pma1-105, pma1-114, and pma1-147 that resulted in amino acid substitutions of Ser-368----Phe, Gly-158----Asp, Pro-640----Leu, respectively. An A----G transition mutation at -39 in the 5'-untranslated region of the mRNA of pma1-155 was also found. This mutation creates an out-of-Frame upstream AUG initiation codon that apparently reduces normal translation of PMA1. DNA sequence analysis of PMA1 from strain Y55 identified 9 base pair substitutions that resulted in 6 amino acid changes in nonconserved regions when compared to the published sequence for strain S288C. Plasma membranes of three of the four pma1 mutants contained normal amounts of H(+)-ATPase; membranes from pma1-155 contained enzyme at 62% of the wild-type level. The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis were most strongly altered for enzymes from pma1-105 and pma1-147 which showed changes in both Km and Vmax. A striking pH dependence for these parameters was found for enzyme from pma1-105 which resulted in a precipitous decline in Km and Vmax below pH 6.5. ATP hydrolysis by enzymes from pma1-105 and pma1-147 was insensitive to inhibition by vanadate. These enzymes, in contrast to wild-type and vanadate-sensitive mutant enzymes, were poorly protected from trypsin-induced inactivation by MgATP and vanadate or Pi alone. These results are pertinent to the mechanism of vanadate-induced enzyme inhibition and suggest that Ser-368 and Pro-640 influence the affinity of the phosphate-binding site for Pi. All mutant enzymes catalyzed ATP-induced pH gradient formation following purification and reconstitution into liposomes. Finally, these results further demonstrate the usefulness of hygromycin B as a generalized screening tool for isolating diverse plasma membrane ATPase mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2075181467,"CD16 is a low-affinity immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptor that is expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, granulocytes, activated macrophages, and some T lymphocytes. Two similar genes, CD16-I and CD16-II, encode membrane glycoproteins that are anchored by phosphatidylinositol (PI)-glycan and transmembrane polypeptides, respectively. The primary structural requirements for PI-linkage were examined by constructing a series of hybrid cDNA molecules. Although both cDNA's have an identical COOH-terminal hydrophobic segment, CD16-I has Ser203 whereas CD16-II has Phe203. Conversion of Phe to Ser in CD16-II permits expression of a PI-glycan-anchored glycoprotein, whereas conversion of Ser to Phe in CD16-I prevents PI-glycan linkage."
https://openalex.org/W2093488327,"The isolated head fragment of myosin is a motor protein that is able to use energy liberated from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate to cause sliding movement of actin filaments. Expression of a myosin fragment nearly equivalent to the amino-terminal globular head domain, generally referred to as subfragment 1, has been achieved by transforming the eukaryotic organism Dictyostelium discoideum with a plasmid that carries a 2.6-kilobase fragment of the cloned Dictyostelium myosin heavy chain gene under the control of the Dictyostelium actin-15 promoter. The recombinant fragment of the myosin heavy chain was purified 2400-fold from one of the resulting cell lines and was found to be functional by the following criteria: the myosin head fragment copurified with the essential and regulatory myosin light chains, decorated actin filaments, and displayed actin-activated adenosine triphosphatase activity. In addition, motility assays in vitro showed that the recombinant myosin fragment is capable of supporting sliding movement of actin filaments."
https://openalex.org/W1536807303,"Abstract Fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to study oligomerization of the purified erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase. The energy transfer efficiency has been measured at different enzyme concentrations, from fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate attached on one enzyme molecule to eosin 5-maleimide or tetramethylrhodamine 5-isothiocyanate attached on another enzyme molecule. The energy transfer efficiency showed a sigmoid dependence on enzyme concentration and was half-maximal at 10-12 nM enzyme; this dependence on enzyme concentration closely resembled previously demonstrated dependence of Ca2+-ATPase activity and polarization of the fluorescein 5'-isothiocyanate enzyme (Kosk-Kosicka, D., and Bzdega, T. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18184-18189). Thus, the three independent methods establish that enzyme concentration-dependent oligomerization is a mechanism of activation of the erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase. Further energy transfer studies demonstrated that enzyme oligomerization required calcium. This calcium dependence was characterized by high affinity (half-maximal energy transfer at pCa 7.15) and cooperativity (Hill coefficient of 2.36), being very similar in both respects to the Ca2+ dependence of the Ca2+-ATPase activity. The data indicated that the oligomerization process produced a highly cooperative, Ca2+-regulated activation of the enzyme at physiologically relevant Ca2+ concentrations. These studies show that the Ca2+-ATPase can be fully activated by a Ca2+-dependent oligomerization mechanism, which is independent of the previously described activation by calmodulin. We propose two pathways for the activation of the Ca2+-ATPase, taking into account the interdependencies between the Ca2+, calmodulin, and enzyme concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W1551543540,"Abstract Polymorphonuclear leukocytes, PMNs, incubated in a chemoattractant undergo a time-dependent decrease in responsiveness to the chemoattractant; i.e. they desensitize or adapt. We have examined the role of ligand-induced changes at early steps in signal transduction for adaptation of PMNs to chemoattractants. The chemoattractant stimulation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTPase activity on PMN membranes was used as an assay of signal transduction. We find a decreased basal GTPase activity and a decrease in the ability of N-formylnorleucylleucylphenylalanine (FN-LLP) to stimulate this activity on membranes prepared from PMNs incubated with the chemotactic peptide FNLLP. The basal GTPase activity is decreased by up to 70% and the peptide-stimulated GTPase activity by up to 95% on membranes from PMNs incubated for 20 min at 37 degrees C in 10(-7) M FNLLP. The decrease in peptide-stimulated GTPase activity cannot be accounted for by the decreased number of FNLLP receptors on the membranes. Rather, receptors that remain available for binding stimulate the GTPase activity with a decreased efficiency. The ligand-induced change in GTPase activity is not stimulus specific. GTPase activity stimulated by both C5a and LTB4 was decreased on membranes from PMNs incubated in FNLLP. The decrease in chemoattractant-stimulated GTPase activity is partially reversed if cells are subsequently incubated at 37 degrees C in the absence of peptide prior to membrane preparation. We detected no quantitative or qualitative change in either pertussis toxin substrates or immunoreactive G proteins when membranes from control and FNLLP-treated cells were compared."
https://openalex.org/W2080789072,Diphtheria toxin (DTx) provokes extensive internucleosomal degradation of DNA before cell lysis. The possibility that DNA cleavage stems from direct chromosomal attack by intracellular toxin molecules was tested by in vitro assays for a DTx-associated nuclease activity. DTx incubated with DNA in solution or in a DNA-gel assay showed Ca2+- and Mg2+-stimulated nuclease activity. This activity proved susceptible to inhibition by specific antitoxin and migrated with fragment A of the toxin. Assays in which supercoiled double-stranded DNA was used revealed rapid endonucleolytic attack. Discovery of a DTx-associated nuclease activity lends support to the model that DTx-induced cell lysis is not a simple consequence of protein synthesis inhibition.
https://openalex.org/W1523812006,"A third isoform of myosin I has been isolated from Acanthamoeba and designated myosin IC. Peptide maps and immunoassays indicate that myosin IC is not a modified form of myosin IA, IB, or II. However, myosin IC has most of the distinctive properties of a myosin I. It is a globular protein of native Mr approximately 162,000, apparently composed of a single 130-kDa heavy chain and a pair of 14-kDa light chains. It is soluble in MgATP at low ionic strength, conditions favoring filament assembly by myosin II. Myosin IC has high Ca2+- and (K+,EDTA)-ATPase activities. Its low Mg2+-ATPase activity is stimulated to a maximum rate of 20 s-1 by the addition of F-actin if its heavy chain has been phosphorylated by myosin I heavy chain kinase. The dependence of the Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin IC on F-actin concentration is triphasic; and, at fixed concentrations of F-action, this activity increases cooperatively as the concentration of myosin IC is increased. These unusual kinetics were first demonstrated for myosins IA and IB and shown to be due to the presence of two actin-binding sites on each heavy chain which enable those myosins I to cross-link actin filaments. Myosin IC is also capable of cross-linking F-actin, which, together with the kinetics of its actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity, suggests that it, like myosins IA and IB, possesses two independent actin-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W1510568971,"Abstract Leukosialin (CD43) is a heavily O-glycosylated membrane glycoprotein present on all leukocytes and on platelets. We found that leukosialin is phosphorylated in erythroid, myeloid, and T-lymphoid cell lines, as well as in platelets and peripheral blood lymphocytes. Leukosialin phosphorylation was increased 2.5-15-fold following phorbol ester treatment. The phosphorylation could be inhibited with the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine but not with HA 1004 that inhibits cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinases. The phosphoamino acid analysis showed that serine residues were exclusively phosphorylated, either with or without phorbol ester treatment. Two-dimensional peptide maps of phosphorylated leukosialin from K562 and Jurkat cells gave almost identical patterns. The number of labeled peptides increased after treatment with phorbol ester, indicating that new sites were phosphorylated. The major phosphorylation site on leukosialin was identified as Ser-332 in a region of the cytoplasmic domain located 73 amino acids from the transmembrane portion."
https://openalex.org/W1584389037,"Abstract Pre-mRNA transcripts of the human beta-globin gene containing 5-fluoro-, 5-chloro-, and 5-bromouridine were tested for splicing in vitro. Pre-mRNA containing 5-fluorouridine was spliced accurately and efficiently in the nuclear extract from HeLa cells, whereas 5-chloro-, and 5-bromouridine containing transcripts were not spliced. Analysis of the splicing reactions by electrophoresis on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels showed that the latter two transcripts were unable to form active splicing complexes. Treatment of HeLa cell cultures with 5-fluorouridine decreased the splicing activity of the nuclear extracts in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The decrease in splicing activity of these extracts appears to be due in part to a decreased level of U-2 small nuclear RNA and the corresponding ribonucleoprotein particle, U2-snRNP."
https://openalex.org/W1555634993,"In order to study the relationship between assembly, surface expression, and signal transduction of the α/β T-cell antigen receptor-CD3 complex (TCR·CD3), a series of T-cell mutants with a partial block in assembly of the complex was generated. By chemical mutagenesis, we produced somatic cell variants of the human T-leukemia cell line, HPB-ALL, which expressed low amounts of TCR·CD3 complexes on their surface. RNA and protein analyses demonstrated that most variants synthesized normal amounts of the individual members of the complex, i.e. TCR-α, TCR-β, CD3-γ, -δ, -e, and -ζ. In these variants, less than 10% of the TCR.CD3 complexes inside the cell contained the CD3-ζ2 homodimer due to an intrinsic deficiency in the formation of the TCR-α/β heterodimer. The low level of assembly of CD3-ζ2 into the TCR.CD3 complex and an additional decrease in the rate of export of the TCR.CD3 complex from the endoplasmic reticulum explained the low level of expression of α/β receptors on the surface of these mutants. Only cells with the complete set of subunits of the TCR.CD3 complex on their surface were capable of transducing CD3-mediated signals. The results presented in this paper indicate that TCR-α/β heterodimer formation is an obligatory requirement for assemblage of CD3-ζ2 into a functionally competent TCR·CD3 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2079610205,"Using the Geodia cydonium system, we showed that after incubation of competent sponge cells in the presence of lectin, phospholipase A2 was released from the cells. The substrates for this enzyme, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine, were identified in the extracellular material of sponge tissue. In addition, the phospholipase A2 inhibitor calelectrin was identified by immunobiochemical techniques; this molecule was associated with the aggregation factor. Reconstitution experiments strongly suggested that phospholipase A2 catalyzed the release of arachidonic acid, which is then taken up by the cells. Intracellularly, arachidonic acid was metabolized primarily to prostaglandin E2. Inhibition studies revealed that prostaglandin E2 is involved in the ultimate increase of DNA synthesis. These findings suggest that the phospholipase A2-arachidonic acid system is involved in the matrix-initiated signal transduction pathway in sponges."

https://openalex.org/W1521618314,"Abstract Previously we reported that ATPase activity was recovered when the subunit alpha + beta + gamma or alpha + beta + delta of the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic bacterium PS3 were combined under appropriate conditions. Unlike that of holoenzyme (TF1) and the alpha + beta + gamma mixture, ATPase activity of the alpha + beta + delta mixture was heat labile and insensitive to azide inhibition (Yoshida, M., Sone, N., Hirata, H., and Kagawa, Y. (1977) J. Biol. Chem. 252, 3480-3485). Here, the properties of purified subunit complexes were compared in detail with those of native TF1. The subunit stoichiometries of the complexes were determined to be alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 1 and alpha 3 beta 3 delta 1. In general, the properties of the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complex are very similar to those of TF1, whereas those of the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex are significantly different. ATPase activity of the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex is cold labile. The alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex showed a less stringent specificity for substrate and divalent cation than TF1 and the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complex. Two Km values for ATP were exhibited by the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex with the lower one being in the range of 0.1 microM. Equilibrium dialysis experiments revealed that the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex cannot specifically bind ADP in the absence of Mg2+, while TF1 and the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complex bind about 1 and 3 mol of ADP/mol of enzyme, respectively. ADP-dependent inactivation of the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was not observed. The alpha 3 beta 3 gamma complex was readily formed when the gamma subunit was added to the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex, suggesting that the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex is not a dead-end complex. The cause of thermolability of the alpha 3 beta 3 delta complex appears to be the low stability of the complex itself at high temperature and not due to an unusually low thermostability of the delta subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1548995463,"Abstract Our previous studies have demonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) modulated cellular responses to interleukin-1 (IL-1). In this communication, we show that PDGF regulates expression of IL-1 receptor (IL-1 R) gene. Treatment of quiescent cultures of Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts with PDGF produced 20-30-fold stimulation of IL-1 R mRNA with a concomitant increase in cell surface 125I-binding. IL-1 R mRNA accumulation occurred after an initial lag period and with a time course preceding the increase in 125I-IL-1 binding to cells. Induction of IL-1 R mRNA was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, suggesting that a product of a gene expressed immediately after PDGF addition is required for IL-1 R gene expression. These latter data provide evidence for an ordered sequence of expression of PDGF-inducible immediate early gene(s) and IL-1 R gene. These results suggest that in connective tissues, PDGF may be an important determinant in initiating and maintaining cellular responses to IL-1. Such responses may have important consequences in the actions of IL-1 under normal and pathological conditions such as arthritis and atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2152522761,"Abstract Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a naturally occurring steroid secreted from the adrenal, has been reported to decrease the body weight gain in rodents without suppressing food intake and to stimulate malic enzyme activity in liver (Tepperman, H. M., de la Garza, S. A., and Tepperman, J. (1968) Am. J. Physiol. 214, 1126-1132). Herrin, we demonstrate that DHEA induces hepatic malic enzyme activity by increasing the rate of transcription of the malic enzyme gene. This transcriptional activation of the malic enzyme gene is dose dependent, i.e. the treatment of euthyroid male rats with daily doses of 17.5 and 35 mg of DHEA/100 g of body weight for 7 days elevated the rate of malic enzyme gene transcription in liver above the basal levels 4-5- and 8-9-fold, respectively. The levels of nuclear malic enzyme RNA, cytoplasmic malic enzyme mRNA, and enzyme activity were increased correspondingly. Malic enzyme stimulation by DHEA was liver specific, i.e. malic enzyme activity in brain, heart, kidney, and testis was unchanged. Thyroid hormone is required for the induction of hepatic malic enzyme activity by DHEA since in hypothyroid animals, DHEA was without effect. However, stimulatory effects of thyroid hormone and DHEA on malic enzyme expression are additive in euthyroid rat livers at both levels of gene transcription and enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1522694985,"Purified placental lipocortin I but not lipocortin II was proteolyzed during A431 cell membrane-catalyzed phosphorylation reactions. Proteolysis was Ca2+-dependent but was not prevented in the presence of a variety of inhibitors of Ca2+-dependent proteases, suggesting that the Ca2+ effect is a property of lipocortin I itself. Proteolysis was inhibited by Triton X-100 or dithiothreitol and was temperature-dependent, occurring at 30 ° C but not at 0 ° C. Tyrosine phosphorylation and proteolysis are distinct events as both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated lipocortins could be cleaved by the membrane protease, but prephosphorylation enhanced the rate of proteolysis 2-fold during the initial reaction and by 60 min almost half of the phosphorylated lipocortin was proteolyzed. Cleavage of the 38-kDa phosphotyrosyl lipocortin I generated a truncated 37-kDa form of lipocortin which retained the phosphate label, indicating that proteolysis occurred at a site N-terminal to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation, possibly at tryptophan 12. Ando, Y., Imamura, S., Hong, Y.-M., Owada, M.K., Kakunaga, T., and Kannagi, R. [1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 6948–6955) have recently reported that in vitro cleavage at sites in the N-terminal tail region of lipocortin I by exogenously added proteases dramatically enhanced the Ca2+ sensitivity of phospholipid binding by lipocortin. The demonstrated ability of an endogenous membrane protease to catalyze a similar and specific cleavage in a Ca2+-dependent manner indicates that this event may occur in the cell where it would have important effects on the functional properties of lipocortin I."
https://openalex.org/W1597218599,"The tailspike protein of Salmonella typhimurium phage P22 is a multifunctional homotrimer which is involved in the terminal reaction of phage assembly, the adsorption of the phage to susceptible cells, and the hydrolysis of the Salmonella O-antigen during the first steps of phage infection. The proteins made from 15 mutant tailspike structural genes carried on high level expression plasmids have been analyzed with respect to their in vivo stability, quaternary structure, capsid assembly activity, and enzymatic activity. Nine mutants synthesize tailspike proteins which fail to accumulate to any appreciable level in vivo, and thus these proteins are probably degraded. Four other altered proteins accumulate in vivo as soluble monomers. The remaining two altered proteins accumulate in vivo as stable trimers. Each of these two proteins is defective for at least one of the known functions of the tailspike protein. One is defective in the capsid assembly reaction and shows an unusual quaternary structural defect but is normal with respect to the enzymatic hydrolysis of O-antigen. The other is defective in the enzymatic hydrolysis of O-antigen but is normal with respect to its capsid assembly activity and quaternary structure. The known sequence changes which give rise to these altered proteins and those of previously identified mutants allow the description of possible functional and structural domains of this multifunctional protein."
https://openalex.org/W1670834718,"Abstract Ribosomal protein S6 is the principal phosphoprotein of the eucaryotic ribosome that becomes multiply phosphorylated on serine residues in response to a wide variety of mitogenic stimuli. In this paper the principal protein phosphatases able to dephosphorylate S6 were characterized in Xenopus laevis ovary and eggs. Two enzymes termed peak I and peak II were found to account for most S6 phosphatase activity in both oocytes and eggs. The peak I enzyme had an apparent Mr of 200,000 on gel filtration, dephosphorylated the beta subunit of phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase a, and was inhibited by inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2, suggesting it was similar to protein phosphatase 1. The peak II enzyme was purified over 12,000-fold and had an apparent Mr = 55,000 on glycerol gradient centrifugation. This phosphatase could dephosphorylate all sites in S6 but was unable to dephosphorylate phosphorylase a or phosphorylase kinase. However, it was inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2. These results indicate the peak II enzyme represents a new class of highly specific protein phosphatase and suggest that inhibition of dephosphorylation in cellular extracts by inhibitor 1 and inhibitor 2 is not a sufficient criterion for implicating protein phosphatase 1 in a cellular process."
https://openalex.org/W1486932504,"The effects of aromatic compounds in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase were investigated. The solubility of the drugs in various organic solvents and water was measured. The ratio between the solubility in organic solvents and that in water (distribution coefficient) was used as an index of their hydrophobicity. The order found was triphenylphosphine greater than diphenylamine greater than 3-nitrophenol greater than 4-nitrophenol greater than 1,3-dihydroxybenzene. The effects observed on the Ca2+-ATPase were correlated with hydrophobicity of the drugs, activation and inhibition being obtained at a lower concentration the greater the distribution coefficient of the drug into organic solvent. In leaky vesicles, the effects of each compound on the ATPase activity varied depending on the Ca2+ concentration in the medium: it inhibited in the presence of 5 microM Ca2+ and activated when the Ca2+ concentration was raised to 2 mM. In intact vesicles, 3- and 4-nitrophenol, diphenylamine, and triphenylphosphine enhanced both the rate of ATP hydrolysis and the amount of Ca2+ accumulated by the vesicles. These four drugs inhibited Ca2+ uptake when ITP was used as substrate. 1,3-Dihydroxybenzene enhanced the amount of Ca2+ accumulated by the vesicles regardless of whether ATP or ITP was the substrate. All five compounds inhibited the phosphorylation ofmore » the enzyme by Pi, the efflux of Ca2+, and the synthesis of ATP measured during the reversal of the Ca2+ pump. The results indicate that the hydrophobic character of various organic compounds determines their access to sensitive domains of the membrane-bound calcium pump. Additional specific effects are then produced, depending on the structure of each compound.« less"
https://openalex.org/W1520442665,"Abstract Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) content of atrial granules revealed the presence of at least 15 immunoreactive spots whose molecular mass distribution ranged from 16.8 to 35 kDa and their pI values from 5.12 to 5.98. About 90% of the immunoreactive ANF material was contained within four spots (spot 1: 34.8 kDa, pI 5.67; spot 5: 16.8 kDa, pI 5.50; spot 6: 16.8 kDa, pI 5.67; spot 7: 16.8 kDa, pI 5.98). Investigation of the molecular nature of spot 1 indicated that it is a dimer of pro-ANF since it possesses the same immunoreactivity, the same charge, double its mass, and can be converted with dithiothreitol into a 16.8-kDa pro-ANF form. Alkaline phosphatase and protein kinase A treatments indicated that spots 5, 6, and 7 are probably not phosphorylated forms of pro-ANF. Carboxypeptide A and B treatments in conjunction with amino acid analysis suggested that spot 7 is ANF-(1-128); spot 6, the major one, ANF-(1-126); and spot 5, ANF-(1-123) or ANF-(1-124). Water deprivation or morphine injection, two maneuvers which are known to influence ANF secretion and atrial ANF content, failed to affect the molecular heterogeneity of pro-ANF except for spot 1. The formation of the dimer appeared to be time-dependent. These results emphasize the heterogeneity of the pro-ANF molecule stored in atrial granules. We suggest that this heterogeneity may be due, in part, to the action of some proteases, such as carboxypeptidase E or a tripeptidyl carboxyhydrolase."
https://openalex.org/W1559693636,"The adenovirus E1A gene encodes a protein that transcriptionally activates viral early genes. We have reported that a 49-amino acid chemically synthesized adenovirus type 2 E1A region 3 peptide, PD3 (residues 140-188 of the 289-amino acid protein), can stimulate transcription in vitro from the adenovirus major late promoter. Here we describe reaction properties of E1A trans-activation in vitro with the major late promoter and the early gene 3 promoter and the structural requirements for activity. Stimulation of transcription by PD3 is highest with low levels of DNA template and nuclear extract, and the presence of PD3 eliminates the need to preincubate template with nuclear extract to achieve optimal transcription. These findings suggest that PD3 facilitates a rate-limiting step in the formation of a promoter complex. Analysis of deletion and cysteine substitution mutant PD3 peptides indicates that the C-terminal 70% of the peptide is sufficient for trans-activation in vitro and supports the hypothesis that PD3 contains two functional subregions. The function of one region (residues 140 to about 152) can be overridden under conditions used for in vitro transcription. The second region (residues 153-188) is essential and may function both as a promoter-binding region and as an activating region in vitro."
