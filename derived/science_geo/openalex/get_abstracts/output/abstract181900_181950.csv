https://openalex.org/W2035421462,"GPR41 and GPR43 are related members of a homologous family of orphan G protein-coupled receptors that are tandemly encoded at a single chromosomal locus in both humans and mice. We identified the acetate anion as an agonist of human GPR43 during routine ligand bank screening in yeast. This activity was confirmed after transient transfection of GPR43 into mammalian cells using Ca2+ mobilization and [35S]guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding assays and by coexpression with GIRK G protein-regulated potassium channels in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Other short chain carboxylic acid anions such as formate, propionate, butyrate, and pentanoate also had agonist activity. GPR41 is related to GPR43 (52% similarity; 43% identity) and was activated by similar ligands but with differing specificity for carbon chain length, with pentanoate being the most potent agonist. A third family member,GPR42, is most likely a recent gene duplication ofGPR41 and may be a pseudogene. GPR41 was expressed primarily in adipose tissue, whereas the highest levels of GPR43 were found in immune cells. The identity of the cognate physiological ligands for these receptors is not clear, although propionate is known to occur in vivo at high concentrations under certain pathophysiological conditions.

G protein-coupled receptor guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) fluorometric imaging plate reader pertussis toxin human GPR41 rat GPR41 reverse transcriptase propionic acidemia Within family A of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)1 gene superfamily (also classified as family 1), there is a phylogenetically related group of ∼90 receptors that respond to an unusually wide variety of ligand types, considering the relatively close similarity of their primary sequences (1Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar). The group includes receptors that respond to purinergic or pyrimidinergic nucleotides (P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, and P2Y13), modified nucleotides (UDP-glucose), lipids (platelet-activating factor receptor), leukotrienes (BLT1 and BLT2and CysLT1 and CysLT2), proteases (protease-activated receptor-1–4), chemoattractants (FPR1), and chemokines. To date, these receptors have no clear homologs in invertebrates, unlike the monoamine or neuropeptide receptors, suggesting a relatively recent evolutionary origin (2C. elegans Sequencing Consortium Science. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Google Scholar, 3Adams M.D. Celniker S.E. Holt R.A. Evans C.A. Gocayne J.D. Amanatides P.G. Scherer S.E. Li P.W. Hoskins R.A. Galle R.F. George R.A. Lewis S.E. Richards S. Ashburner M. Henderson S.N. Sutton G.G. Wortman J.R.

At least 50 GPCRs whose cognate ligands are unknown (orphans) (4Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Chambers J.K. Muir A.I. Fantom K.G.M. Ellis C. Murdock P. Herrity N.C. Stadel J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1387-1392Google Scholar) are categorized within this group on the basis of sequence homology. Often, these orphans fall into subsets, being more related to each other than to receptors with known ligands; and this, combined with the ligand diversity noted above, makes it difficult to predict the chemical nature of their ligands. One subset comprises GPR40–43, which were identified as tandemly encoded genes present on cosmids isolated from human chromosomal locus 19q13.1 (5Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar). GPR42 differs from GPR41 at only six amino acid positions; otherwise, the four members of this subfamily share ∼30% minimum identity. BLAST searches have identified the next most closely related receptors as the protease-activated receptors. However, the long N-terminal extracellular domains that serve as protease substrates and that are characteristic of protease-activated receptors are absent in the GPR40–43 group, suggesting that they are not activated by a similar mechanism. By adopting a ligand fishing strategy (4Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Chambers J.K. Muir A.I. Fantom K.G.M. Ellis C. Murdock P. Herrity N.C. Stadel J.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1387-1392Google Scholar) following heterologous expression of orphan GPCRs in yeast, we found that short chain carboxylic acid anions can activate GPR41 and GPR43 in a dose-dependent and -specific manner. These molecules represent a novel chemical class of GPCR ligand. The known pharmacological and pathological effects of these ligands and the tissue distribution of GPR43 suggest potential roles in immune cell function and hematopoiesis. The relevance of GPR41 is less clear. Furthermore, our data support the hypothesis (5Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar) thatGPR42 arose as a tandem duplication of GPR41 in the human lineage and has acquired mutations since duplication that abolish its ability to respond to carboxylate ions. Ligands for GPR40 are described in the accompanying article (6Briscoe C.P. Tadayyon M. Andrews J.L. Benson W.G. Chambers J.K. Eilert M.M. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N.A. Goetz A.S. Minnick D.T.

Carboxylates were obtained from Sigma as sodium salts or free acids and were prepared as 100 mm or 1m stock solutions of the sodium salt and adjusted to pH 7.0. Peptides for antibody generation were obtained from Severn Biotech Ltd. Yeast cells were derived from the dual-reporter gene strain MMY11 (MAT a fus1::FUS1-HIS3 LEU2::FUS1-lacZ far1Δ sst2Δ ste2Δ gpa1::ADE2 his3 ura3 trp1) (7Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2756-2763Google Scholar). To introduce Gα subunits into this strain, expression cassettes comprising theGPA1 promoter, Gα coding sequence, and the ADH1terminator (8Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar) were subcloned into pRS304 and integrated into thetrp1 locus of MMY11. Integrants were selected to have low basal levels of reporter gene activity. This produced an isogenic panel of yeast strains containing a range of functional Gα subunits as follows: MMY12, wild-type Gpa1p; MMY14, Gpa1p/Gαq; MMY15, Gpa1p/Gαs; MMY16 Gpa1p/Gα16; MMY19, Gpa1p/Gα12; MMY20, Gpa1p/Gα13; MMY21, Gpa1p/Gα14; MMY22, Gpa1p/Gαo; MMY23, Gpa1p/Gαi1; and MMY24, Gpa1p/Gαi3. MMY16 and MMY23 have been described previously (7Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2756-2763Google Scholar, 9Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Honda Y. Dyos S.L. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1025-1033Google Scholar). Mammalian GPCRs were expressed using the p426GPD vector (10Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in an in vivo bioassay during growth in liquid culture using the chromogenic substrate chlorophenolred-β-d-galactopyranoside (7Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2756-2763Google Scholar). A library of 80 known or candidate GPCR agonists, similar to those described previously (11Chambers J.K. Macdonald L.E. Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Freeman K. Foley J.J. Zhu Y. McLaughlin M.M. Murdock P. McMillan L. Trill J. Swift A. Aiyar N. Taylor P. Vawter L. Naheed S. Szekeres P.G. Hervieu G. Scott C. Watson J.M. Murphy A.J. Duzic E. Klein C. Bergsma D.J. Wilson S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10767-10771Google Scholar), was screened at final concentrations ranging from 0.2 μm to 2.5 mm. Xenopus laevis oocyte isolation and microinjection were performed as described previously (12Main M.J. Brown J. Brown S. Fraser N.J. Foord S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 6-10Google Scholar). Human GPR43 cRNA was produced using T7 polymerase (Promega) from linearized plasmid pJG3.6-hGPR43 and co-injected withGIRK1 and GIRK4 cRNAs into single oocytes in stage V or VI. Potassium current amplitude was measured using dual microelectrode voltage clamp electrophysiometry (12Main M.J. Brown J. Brown S. Fraser N.J. Foord S.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 6-10Google Scholar). Mammalian cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (pH 7.4) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine, except where otherwise indicated. HEK293T cells were grown to 60–80% confluency in 90-mm dishes, transfected with cDNA (total DNA = 9 μg) using LipofectAMINE reagent (30 μl; Invitrogen), and collected 48 h after transfection. Immunoblotting was performed by standard methods (13Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 79: 4350-4354Google Scholar). [35S]GTPγS binding assays were performed on plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions at room temperature in 96-well format as described previously (14Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Google Scholar). Bound [35S]GTPγS was determined by scintillation counting. Maintenance, transfection, and fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) (Molecular Devices) assay of internal Ca2+concentration in HEK293 cells were performed as described previously (15Szekeres P.G. Muir A.I. Spinage L.D. Miller J.E. Butler S.I. Smith A. Rennie G.I. Murdock P.R. Fitzgerald L.R. Wu H.-l. McMillan L.J. Guerrera S. Vawter L. Elshourbagy N.A. Mooney J.L. Bergsma D.J. Wilson S. Chambers J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20247-20250Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment was carried out by supplementation of the medium at 50 ng/ml for 18 h. Swiss 3T3-L1 and 3T3-L442A fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in medium supplemented with penicillin or streptomycin (100 units/ml or 100 μg/ml, respectively). Cells were differentiated 2 days after confluence by supplementation of the culture medium with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (500 mm), dexamethasone (0.25 μm), insulin (0.8 μm), and Myoclone for 2 days, followed by insulin (0.8 μm) and Myoclone only for an additional 2 days. RNA was extracted (RNeasy, QIAGEN Inc.) from differentiated cells within eight passages from original stocks. The antigen peptide CEQKGGEEQRADRPAERKTSEHSQGC (SB130) corresponds to an internal sequence shared by human GPR41 (hGPR41) and hGPR42 (amino acids 311–335) in the predicted C-terminal tail (5Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar). SB130 was conjugated to the carrier protein tuberculin PPD via the cysteine residues and used to immunize female New Zealand White rabbits. The immune response was monitored by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using plates coated with the free peptide, and immunoglobulins from high titer sera were purified using immobilized peptide (Sulfolink, Perbio). Purified antibodies were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Primers and probes for TaqMan analysis (PE Applied Biosystems) were designed using Primer Express software (PE Applied Biosystems) and compared with public databases by BLAST searches to confirm specificity (Table I). RNA concentrations were determined using RiboGreen (Molecular Probes, Inc.), and PCRs were performed in an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems). For the human tissue samples shown in Fig. 5 A, poly(A)+ RNA (1 μg) from 20 tissues of four different individuals (two males and two females except prostate) was prepared, reverse-transcribed using Superscript II and random 9-mer priming (Invitrogen), and diluted and plated using Biomek robotics (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) to produce 1000 replica plates with each well containing the cDNA from 1 ng of RNA. TaqMan quantitative PCR analysis of each sample was conducted as described previously (16Chapman C.G. Meadows H.J. Godden R.J. Campbell D.A. Duckworth M. Kelsell R.E. Murdock P.R. Randall A.D. Rennie G.I. Gloger I.S. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 82: 74-83Google Scholar). For the immune cell samples shown in Fig. 5 B, total RNA was extracted from samples derived from up to three individuals using the RNeasy maxiprep procedure (QIAGEN Inc.). Samples were treated with DNase I (Ambion Inc.) and normalized to levels of 18 S ribosomal RNA. Reactions were run in 50 μl containing 5.5 mmMgCl2, 1× TaqMan buffer A (PE Applied Biosystems), 300 μm dNTP mixture, 20 units of RNase inhibitor, 12.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, 900 nm each primer, 200 nm probe, 1.25 units of Amplitaq Gold (PE Applied Biosystems), and 50 ng of total RNA. Cycling conditions were as follows: 30 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 94 °C, followed by 1 min at 60 °C.Table IOligonucleotides used in TaqMan experimentsGeneOligonucleotide sequencehGPR41Forward primerACCTGCTGGCCCTGGTGReverse primerGGTCAGGTTGAGCAGGAGCAProbeCAAGCTGCAGCGCCGCCChGPR42Forward primerAs hGPR41Reverse primerAs hGPR41ProbeCAAGCTGCGGTGCCGCCChGPR43Forward primerGGCTTTCCCCGTGCAGTACReverse primerCCAGAGCTGCAATCACTCCATProbeAGCTCTCCCGCCGGCCTCTGMouseGpr41Forward primerTTCTTGCAGCCACACTGCTCReverse primerGCCCACCACATGGGACATATProbeTCTTCTTCGTCTGCTTCGGCCCCTATAdipsinForward primerTCGAAGGTGTGGTTACGTGGReverse primerGGGTATAGACGCCCGGCTTProbeTTGCCATTGCCACAGACGCGACEBPαaCEBPα, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Forward primerCGCAAGAGCCGAGATAAAGCReverse primerTGGTCAACTCCAGCACCTTCTProbeAAACAACGCAACGTGGAGACGCAAGAPDHaCEBPα, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.Forward primerCAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTGReverse primerGGGCCATCCACAGTCTTCTGProbeACCACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCATβ-ActinForward primerGAGCTATGAGCTGCCTGACGReverse primerAGTTTCATGGATGCCACAGGAProbeCATCACTATTGGCAACGAGCGGTTCCRL19Forward primerCAAGCGGATTCTCATGGAACAReverse primerTGGTCAGCCAGGAGCTTCTTProbeTCCACAAGCTGAAGGCAGACAAGGCa CEBPα, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Open table in a new tab Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated through graded alcohols. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using a Ventana Nexus automated stainer with Ventana reagents (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Antigen retrieval was carried out using protease-1 for 32 min at 37 °C. Rabbit anti-hGPR41 immunoglobulins were applied at 0.2 mg/ml for 32 min at 37 °C, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary IgG (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Enhanced diaminobenzidine kit was used for detection, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been established as a useful host for heterologous expression and functional analysis of GPCRs (17Pausch M.H. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 487-494Google Scholar). The system is engineered to allow mammalian GPCRs to couple to the endogenous yeast signal transduction pathway that responds to mating pheromone in wild-type cells. The yeast pheromone receptor Ste2p is deleted from the strains commonly used to provide a null background lacking endogenous host receptors. Another advantage, particularly in the analysis of orphan GPCRs for which no ligand is known, is that ligand-independent G protein activation (“constitutive activity”) can frequently be detected, thus confirming functional expression of the receptor (7Olesnicky N.S. Brown A.J. Dowell S.J. Casselton L.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2756-2763Google Scholar, 18Baranski T.J. Herzmark P. Lichtarge O. Gerber B.O. Trueheart J. Meng E.C. Iiri T. Sheikh S.P. Bourne H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15757-15765Google Scholar). We used a set of plasmid constructs encoding orphan GPCRs under the transcriptional control of strong yeast promoters. These were introduced into yeast containing dual reporter genes and a chimeric Gα subunit in which the five C-terminal amino acids of mammalian Gαi3 were fused to the remainder of the yeast Gα protein Gpa1p (8Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar). In the absence of any added ligand, the orphan hGPR43 caused significant activation of the FUS1-lacZ reporter gene, which is under the control of the pheromone response pathway in these cells, indicating that hGPR43 was functionally expressed (Fig. 1,A and B). Yeast cells expressing hGPR43 were then used to screen a collection of known GPCR ligands plus compounds with demonstrated biological activity, but no known mechanism of action. Several compounds, all formulated as salts containing acetate counterions (19Ueda H. Yoshihara Y. Misawa H. Fukushima N. Katada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3732-3741Google Scholar), activated hGPR43. Further experiments using sodium acetate or ammonium acetate buffered to pH 7.0 indicated that the acetate anion alone was sufficient to cause concentration-dependent reporter gene activation over and above that attributable to the constitutive activity of hGPR43. The median effective concentration (EC50) of this response was 137 ± 24 μm. Control cells expressing the human somatostatin SST2 receptor (8Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar) did not respond to acetate (Fig. 1 A). To investigate the G protein specificity of this response, hGPR43 was introduced into a series of similar yeast strains containing different yeast/mammalian Gα chimeras (8Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar). Elevated reporter levels in the absence of acetate (constitutive activity) and induction in the presence of acetate indicated the activation of the particular chimera. hGPR43 could activate Gpa1p/Gα chimeras containing the C termini of mammalian Gα12, Gα13, Gα14, Gαi1, and Gαi3 (Fig. 1 B). Because the G protein specificity for chimeras in yeast generally conforms to that observed in mammalian cells (8Brown A.J. Dyos S.L. Whiteway M.S. White J.H.M. Watson M.-A. Marzioch M. Clare J.J. Cousens D.J. Paddon C.J. Plumpton C. Romanos M.A. Dowell S.J. Yeast. 2000; 16: 11-22Google Scholar), this suggests that GPR43 may activate the Gi, Gq, and G12 families of G proteins. We next determined whether acetate could activate hGPR43 expressed in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with hGPR43 and loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye Fluo-4. Intracellular calcium ion concentrations ([Ca2+]i) were measured using the FLIPR. Acetate provoked transient increases in [Ca2+]i(EC50 = 52 ± 10 μm). Control cells, transiently transfected with hGPR40 or the μ-opioid receptor, showed no change in [Ca2+]i in response to acetate (Fig. 2 A). To determine which class of G protein was involved in this response, we used the specific inhibitor of Gi/o family proteins, PTX. Treatment with PTX had no significant effect on either the magnitude or EC50 of the [Ca2+]i response to acetate in HEK293 cells expressing GPR43 compared with vehicle-treated cells. In contrast, PTX treatment completely abolished the [Ca2+]i response of control cells stably expressing the APJ receptor (20Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X. Kawamata Y. Fukusumi S. Hinuma S. Kitada C. Kurokawa T. Onda H. Fujino M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 471-476Google Scholar) to apelin-13 (Fig.2 B). In a separate experiment, we introduced hGPR43 into HEK293T cells by cotransfection in combination with the Gi/o family protein Gαo1. Acetate provoked dose-dependent increases in [35S]GTPγS binding in membranes prepared from these cells (Fig. 3). Acetate responses mediated by hGPR43 could also be detected in X. laevis oocytes upon coexpression with GIRK G protein-regulated potassium channels. In vitro synthesized RNA encoding hGPR43 and the inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits GIRK1 and GIRK4 (Kir3.1/Kir3.4) were co-microinjected into oocytes, and transmembrane conductance was measured in the presence of a buffer containing a high concentration (90 mm) of potassium ions. Application of acetate resulted in inward shifts in holding current (EC50 = 202 ± 68 μm) (Fig.2 C). No such shifts occurred in control oocytes injected with GIRK1/GIRK4 alone (n = 5) (data not shown). Together, these results confirm the original observation in yeast that hGPR43 is activated by acetate.Figure 3Short chain carboxylic acids activate hGPR43 and hGPR41. Stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding by formate (○), acetate (▴), propionate (▪), butyrate (■), or pentanoate (♦) was determined in HEK293T membranes prepared from cells transiently transfected with hGPR43 (A) or hGPR41 (B) in combination with Gαo1. Data from single representative experiments are presented as the means of assays performed in triplicate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we determined whether other carboxylate anions could also activate hGPR43. The C3 carboxylate propionate stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding in HEK293T cell membranes containing hGPR43 and Gαo1 with a potency similar to that of acetate. Longer chain acid anions were also active. Relative potencies were as follows: acetate (C2) = propionate (C3) = butyrate (C4) > pentanoate (C5) > hexanoate (C6) = formate (C1) (Fig. 3 A and Table II). A similar rank order of potency for these ligands was found using the FLIPR assay (Table II). Another member of the GPR40–43 receptor subfamily, GPR41, is closely related to GPR43 (43% amino acid identity in human) and is encoded adjacent toGPR43 at human chromosomal locus 19p13.1 (5Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar). hGPR41 was cotransfected into HEK293T cells with Gαo1, and ligand-stimulated [35S]GTPγS binding was assessed in membranes prepared from these cells. As expected from the close sequence similarity, hGPR41 was activated by the same carboxylate ligands, although with a different rank order of potency: propionate = pentanoate = butyrate > acetate > formate (Fig. 3 B). Thus, hGPR41 and hGPR43 are both activated by carboxylate anions, but have differing specificities for carbon chain length, with pentanoate (C5) activating hGPR41 more potently than acetate, but with acetate activating hGPR43 more potently than pentanoate. Formate and several of the longer chain carboxylates were lower efficacy agonists of both receptors relative to propionate. A range of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids containing nine or more carbon atoms were also tested, but no activation was observed for either GPR41 or GPR43 (data not shown). A third member of this family, GPR40, is more distantly related to GPR41 and GPR43 (33% amino acid identity between GPR40 and GPR43 in human). GPR40 is activated by carboxylate anions of longer chain length (i.e. fatty acids), but does not appear to respond to carboxylate anions of six carbons or less (6Briscoe C.P. Tadayyon M. Andrews J.L.

Open table in a new tab hGPR42 is also located at 19p13.1 and differs from hGPR41 by only six amino acids (5Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar). We performed similarity searches of public sequence databases to find mammalian orthologs of this pair. Two partially sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbersAC079472 and AC087143) from the mouse locus that is syntenic with human 19p13.1 contained GPR40–43 orthologs. In mouse, only one ortholog of the hGPR41/hGPR42 pair was detected (72% amino acid similarity to hGPR41). From the mouse sequence, we designed oligonucleotide primers and amplified a rat hGPR41/hGPR42 ortholog (accession numberAX224758). We also identified a Bos taurus ortholog from overlapping expressed sequence tags (accession numbers AW632495,AW660795, BE755048, and BI541693). The amino acid sequences of the orthologs were intermediate between hGPR41 and hGPR42, but more similar to hGPR41. Four of the six amino acid positions that differ between hGPR41 and hGPR42 are also conserved among the orthologs. The orthologs match hGPR41 at two or three of these positions, but match hGPR42 at only one (Table III). This suggests that hGPR42 occurred as the result of a gene duplication of hGPR41 that occurred after the human lineage diverged from the rodent and bovine lineages. Furthermore, we found that the rat ortholog is activated by carboxylate anions with similar potencies as hGPR41 (Table II). Because hGPR42 is also reported to occur infrequently in human populations as a polymorphic insert, the mouse, rat, and bovine genes have been namedGpr41. 2The rat orphan GPCR termed GPR41 and described previously by Kimura et al. (32Kimura M. Mizukami Y. Miura T. Fujimoto K. Kobayashi S. Matsuzaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26453-26460Google Scholar) is homologous to hGPR30 and is distinct from the rat ortholog of hGPR41 described here.Table IIIAmino acid positions differing between hGPR41 and hGPR42Position in hGPR41Amino acidMutant in rGPR41Phenotype in yeasthGPR41hGPR42RatMouseBovine44GlnArgArgArgArgR40QFunctional45ArgCysArgArgArgR41CFunctional174ArgTrpArgArgArgR170WInactive227LeuValLeuLeuAlaL223VConstitutive activity256AlaValTWSerThrT252VReduced activity346SerAsnThe residue in each position is shown along with the residue at the equivalent position in the rat, mouse, and bovine orthologs and the phenotypes of mutations introduced into rGPR41 (from Fig.4 A).

Open table in a new tab The residue in each position is shown along with the residue at the equivalent position in the rat, mouse, and bovine orthologs and the phenotypes of mutations introduced into rGPR41 (from Fig.4 A). Position 346 in hGPR41 is the extreme C-terminal residue and is outside the region conserved in the orthologs. To determine the functional relevance of hGPR42, we prepared membranes from HEK293T cells transiently cotransfected with hGPR42 and Gαo1. No stimulation of [35S]GTPγS binding could be detected in response to carboxylate ligands (Fig.4 B). Immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-SB130 serum, which was raised against a conserved region of the predicted C-terminal tail and which cross-reacts with both hGPR41 and hGPR42, confirmed that hGPR42 was present in the transfected cell membranes at levels equal to or greater than hGPR41 levels in control membranes (data not shown). This suggests that hGPR42 is not activated by carboxylate ligands. We introduced mutations into rat GPR41 (rGPR41) to investigate which of the residues differing between hGPR41 and hGPR42 allow carboxylate responses (Table III). These mutations had various effects on the response to propionate (Fig. 4 A), but the most profound phenotype was observed with rGPR41(R170W), which failed to respond. The equivalent position 174 in extracellular loop 2 is positively charged Arg174 in hGPR41, which could potentially form a salt bridge with the carboxylate ligand, whereas Trp174 in hGPR42 could not. As expected, this residue is conserved between hGPR41 and mammalian orthologs. We also demonstrated that the single ami"

However, the mechanism is still elusive. Because reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in apoptosis and inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I by rotenone was thought to be able to elevate mitochondrial ROS production, we investigated the relationship between rotenone-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Rotenone was able to induce mitochondrial complex I substrate-supported mitochondrial ROS production both in isolated mitochondria from HL-60 cells as well as in cultured cells. Rotenone-induced apoptosis was confirmed by DNA fragmentation, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activity. A quantitative correlation between rotenone-induced apoptosis and rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production was identified. Rotenone-induced apoptosis was inhibited by treatment with antioxidants (glutathione, N-acetylcysteine, and vitamin C). The role of rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS in apoptosis was also confirmed by the finding that HT1080 cells overexpressing magnesium superoxide dismutase were more resistant to rotenone-induced apoptosis than control cells. These results suggest that rotenone is able to induce apoptosis via enhancing the amount of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production.

Recently it was recognized that this organelle not only generates ATP, but also plays an important role in apoptosis (for reviews see Refs. 1Green D.R. Reed J.C.

It is now clear that upon apoptotic stimulation mitochondria can release several proapoptotic regulators, including cytochromec (4Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X.

The release of proapoptotic regulators is further regulated by the translocation of Bcl-2 family proteins (9Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Google Scholar,10Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 773-776Google Scholar). Although this evidence places mitochondria in the center of the apoptotic signaling pathway, the role of mitochondrial respiratory chain activity in apoptosis is still elusive. Inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain by rotenone has been widely used to study the role of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in apoptosis (11Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Google Scholar, 12Isenberg J.S. Klaunig J.E. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 340-351Google Scholar, 13Chauvin C. De Oliveira F. Ronot X. Mousseau M. Leverve X. Fontaine E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41394-41398Google Scholar). Some recent evidence showed that rotenone, a mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor, could induce cell death in a variety of cells (11Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol.

The importance of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I inhibitor-induced apoptosis was further recognized with the finding that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α could inhibit the mitochondrial respiratory chain at the mitochondrial complex I site (14Higuchi M. Proske R.J. Yeh E.T. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2515-2524Google Scholar). However, contradictory reports showed that rotenone could inhibit apoptosis in other systems (17Vrablic A.S. Albright C.D. Craciunescu C.N. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1739-1744Google Scholar, 18Torres-Roca J.F. Tung J.W. Greenwald D.R. Brown J.M. Herzenberg L.A. Herzenberg L.A. Katsikis P.D. J.

It has been suggested that ROS1 play an important role in apoptosis, and several groups have shown that molecules that stimulate formation of ROS can result in apoptosis (20Heussler V.T. Fernandez P.C. Botteron C. Dobbelaere D.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 342-350Google Scholar, 21Kelso G.F. Porteous C.M. Coulter C.V. Hughes G. Porteous W.K. Ledgerwood E.C. Smith R.A. Murphy M.P. J.

Others reported production of ROS by a wide range of apoptotic stimuli, including TNF, ceramide, staurosporine, and UV radiation (24Gottlieb E. Vander Heiden M.G. Thompson C.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5680-5689Google Scholar, 25Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Google Scholar, 26Cai J. Jones D.P. J. Biol.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain is one of the most important sites of ROS production under physiological conditions (28Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Google Scholar, 29Martinou J.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 411-412Google Scholar, 30Tan S. Sagara Y. Liu Y. Maher P. Schubert D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1423-1432Google Scholar), and it has been long suspected that mitochondrial ROS play an important role in apoptosis. The mitochondrial-derived ROS are vital not only because mitochondrial respiratory chain components are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, but also because the ROS produced in mitochondria can readily influence mitochondrial function without having to cope with long diffusion times from the cytosol. Two sites in the respiratory chain, complex I and complex III, have been suggested to be the major ROS source (31Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Google Scholar, 32Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Google Scholar, 33Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Google Scholar). Based on stoichiometrical calculation, superoxide was suggested as the primary product, with hydrogen peroxide as the secondary product (34Cadenas E. Boveris A. Ragan C.I. Stoppani A.O. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 180: 248-257Google Scholar). Mitochondrial-derived ROS could be modified when the mitochondrial respiratory chain was interrupted under pathological conditions or by respiratory chain inhibitors (31Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Google Scholar, 33Turrens J.F. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 3-8Google Scholar). Early reports showed that the complex I inhibitor rotenone and the complex b-c1 inhibitor antimycin could stimulate superoxide and hydrogen peroxide formation on submitochondrial particles (31Turrens J.F. Boveris A. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 421-427Google Scholar, 35Turrens J.F. Freeman B.A. Levitt J.G. Crapo J.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 217: 401-410Google Scholar). However, results of rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production measured at the cellular level appeared inconsistent with conflicting results reporting that rotenone could elevate cellular ROS production in some cases (11Barrientos A. Moraes C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16188-16197Google Scholar, 36Nakamura K. Bindokas V.P. Kowlessur D. Elas M. Milstien S. Marks J.D. Halpern H.J. Kang U.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34402-34407Google Scholar) while inhibiting cellular ROS production in others (17Vrablic A.S. Albright C.D. Craciunescu C.N. Salganik R.I. Zeisel S.H. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1739-1744Google Scholar, 37Schuchmann S. Heinemann U. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 235-250Google Scholar, 38Li Y. Trush M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our data show that rotenone can induce mitochondrial ROS production and that rotenone-induced mitochondrial ROS production is closely related to rotenone-induced apoptosis. Hoechst 33342, propidium iodide (PI), and anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit VI antibody were obtained from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR. Hydroethidine was obtained from Polysciences, Warrington, PA. Anti-human caspase 3 antibody and anti-human cytochrome c antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. All other reagents, unless otherwise stated, were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. The human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. HL-60 cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ°) were generated by growing HL-60 cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplied with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mmpyruvate, 50 μg/ml uridine, 25 mm glucose, and 50 ng/ml ethidium bromide for 8 weeks as previously described (39Gomez-Diaz C. Villalba J.M. Perez-Vicente R. Crane F.L. Navas P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 79-81Google Scholar). After selection, the cells were grown in the same medium without ethidium bromide. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark-type oxygen electrode, and no oxygen uptake was observed for ρ° HL-60 cells. The human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080 was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Construction of a stable HT1080 cell line overexpressing magnesium superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) was previously described in detail (40Melendez J.A. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18898-18903Google Scholar). HT1080 cells stably transfected with Mn-SOD were maintained in medium that included 1 mg/ml G418 in addition to the above-mentioned supplements. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Oxygen consumption was measured with a Clark oxygen electrode (model 5300: Yellow Spring Instrument Co., Yellow Spring, OH) as described before (41Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gerard B. Rotig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 × 107 HL-60 cells were treated with various concentrations of rotenone for 30 min. Cells were then collected and resuspended in a medium containing 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mmpotassium HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), and 1 mm MgCl2. The cells were injected into a respiration chamber that was then sealed. The total volume of the respiration chamber was 1.6 ml. Respiration was then measured and calculated as the rate of change in the oxygen concentration, assuming the initial oxygen concentration to be 6.8 mg/liter. Cell respiration was converted to percentage of control. For ATP measurement, a commercially available luciferin-luciferase assay kit was used. Briefly, HL-60 cells were treated with various concentrations of rotenone for 24 h and then collected in 1-ml Eppendorf tubes. After a single wash with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed with the somatic cell ATP-releasing reagent provided by the kit. Luciferin substrate and luciferase enzyme were added and bioluminescence was assessed on a Perkin Elmer 3B spectroflurometer. Whole-cell ATP content was determined by running an internal standard. The cellular ATP level was converted to percentage of untreated cells (control). Intact mitochondria were isolated from cultured HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells (1 × 109 cells) were collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. After one wash with ice-cold Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS at 250 × g, the cells were resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were homogenized in an ice-cold Dounce homogenizer with 20 strokes. Cell disruption was confirmed by trypan blue staining. The disrupted cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 600 × g at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 15,000 ×g, 4 °C, for 10 min, and the resulting pellet was considered as crude mitochondria. The crude mitochondria were further washed twice with the same isolation buffer as described above. The resulting mitochondria pellet was resuspended in isolation buffer without EDTA. Mitochondria suspensions were kept on ice, and all experiments were performed within 5 h. Mitochondrial protein concentration was determined by the biuret method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was measured from the increase of oxidized p-hydroxyphenylacetate (PHPA) fluorescence by horseradish peroxidase (41Rustin P. Chretien D. Bourgeron T. Gerard B. Rotig A. Saudubray J.M. Munnich A. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 228: 35-51Google Scholar, 43Sohal R.S. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1991; 60: 189-198Google Scholar). Fluorescence of oxidized PHPA (excitation 320 nm, emission 400 nm) was measured by a Perkin Elmer 3B spectrofluorimeter. Mitochondria (0.5 mg of protein) were added to 4 ml of medium containing 0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm potassium HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml PHPA, 10 units of horseradish peroxidase, and the substrates for various mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes. Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production was determined by interpolation from the standard curve generated by reagent hydrogen peroxide. Measurement of cellular superoxide production was performed as described previously, with some modifications (44Carter W.O. Narayanan P.K. Robinson J.P. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 55: 253-258Google Scholar). For HL-60 cells, cells were treated with various concentrations of rotenone for 30 min. Cells were then collected and washed in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) at 250 × g. Cells were resuspended in HBSS containing 10 μm hydroethidine (HE) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. For HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, cells were treated with rotenone for 30 min, the medium was then removed, and cells were washed once with HBSS. Cells were then incubated HBSS containing 0.25% trypsin for 5 min. Cells were then resuspended in HBSS containing 10 μm hydroethidine (HE), and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. All cell suspensions were placed into 12 × 75-mm tubes for assay. Flow cytometry studies were carried out on a Beckman-Coulter XL flow cytometer. Ethidium fluorescence was collected using a 610-nm long-pass filter. The DNA fragmentation assay was performed according to the method described previously with some modifications (45Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Google Scholar). HL-60 cells were treated with various concentrations of rotenone in the presence or absence of antioxidants. Cells (2 × 107) were washed once with PBS (4 °C, pH 7.4) and collected by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min. The pellet was then treated with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (10 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate) for 10 min on ice. After treatment with RNase A (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, the cells were incubated at 50 °C for 4 h in the presence of 100 μg/ml proteinase K. DNA was precipitated by addition of 50 μl of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1 ml of cold (4 °C) 100% ethanol to the solution. DNA was then collected and dissolved in TE buffer (10 mm Tris pH 8.0, EDTA 1 mm). For analysis, 10–20 μl of DNA was loaded on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Electrophoresis was performed in 0.5 × Tris borate-EDTA buffer (18 mm Tris-base (pH 8.0), 18 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 70 V for 2 h. DNA was visualized under ultraviolet light and photographed. For HL-60 cells, 2 × 106 were collected by centrifugation at 250 ×g for 5 min. For HT1080 cells, cells were collected by trypsinization and then centrifuged (250 × g) for 5 min. All cells were then resuspended in buffer containing 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES, and 1 mmEDTA, pH 7.4, 4 °C. Digitonin (400 ng/ml) was then added to the cell suspension and lysis of cells confirmed by examining the entry of trypan blue into the cytosol. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 s at 4 °C to pellet the unbroken cells. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The final supernatant was considered as the cytosol fraction, and the final pellet was used as the mitochondrial fraction. For HL-60 cells, ∼1 × 107 cells were harvested and washed once with ice-cold PBS, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, cell lysates were transferred to fresh tubes and stored at −80 °C. For HT1080 cells, cells at 80–90% confluence in 100-mm culture dishes were washed once with HBSS and placed on ice. In each culture dish, 400 μl of lysis buffer was added. After 10 min of incubation, the solubilized proteins were centrifuged at 12,000 × g in a microcentrifuge (4 °C) for 10 min, and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. Cell homogenates (50 μg of protein) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 15% acrylamide gel. Bands of proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad). The PVDF membrane was blocked by PBS containing 5% milk overnight at 4 °C and then incubated with antibodies against either cytochrome c, caspase 3, β-actin, or cytochrome oxidase subunit VI for 3 h at room temperature. After an additional 1-hour incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the binding of antibodies to the PVDF membrane was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting analysis (AmershamBiosciences). Degradation of DNA was measured by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. For flow cytometry analysis, PI was used to detect DNA breakdown as described previously (46Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 15-38Google Scholar). Cells were collected and fixed in suspension in 70% ethanol on ice, and then stored at −20 °C for at least 4 h. Cells were washed with 5 ml of HBSS, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 1 ml of HBSS. After addition of 0.2 ml of phosphate citrate buffer (0.2 mNa2HPO4, 4 mm citric acid, pH 7.8), cells were incubated at room temperature for 5 min before being washed again and resuspended in HBSS containing 20 μg/ml PI and 10 μg/ml RNase A. Cells were incubation in the dark at room temperature for 30 min. PI fluorescence was analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was also measured by observing morphological changes in the nuclear chromatin of cells detected by staining with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 at room temperature for 15 min, followed by examination on a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope. Rotenone-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was investigated by both respiration measurement and determination of cellular ATP level. Fig. 1 Ashows the dose-dependent response of rotenone-inhibited HL-60 cell respiration. Inhibition of cell respiration was detectable at rotenone levels as low as 10 nm. Below 100 nm, increasing concentrations of rotenone produced a rapid decrease in the respiration of the cells. Above 100 nm, the inhibition of respiration continued, but at a lower rate. Rotenone at 500 nm inhibited cell respiration by over 96%. The curve of ATP inhibition by rotenone was similar to the respiration curve (Fig. 1 B). Increasing concentrations of rotenone below 100 nm result in a sharp decrease of cellular ATP level. Above 100 nm, cellular ATP level still decreased, but at a much slower rate. Rotenone at 500 nm decreased cellular ATP level to 64% of control. Higher concentrations of rotenone did not further decrease the ATP level. By comparison, 10 μmoligomycin inhibited cellular ATP level to 55% of control (data not shown). Production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species by HL-60 cells was estimated for both isolated mitochondria and cultured cells. For mitochondrial ROS measurement, a classical horseradish peroxidase-based PHPA oxidation method was used to detect hydrogen peroxide leaked from intact mitochondria when mitochondria were incubated with various respiratory chain substrates and inhibitors. As reported by Hansford et al. (42Hansford R.G. Hogue B.A. Mildaziene V. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 89-95Google Scholar), an inhibition of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation was observed in our system when a higher concentration of PHPA was used. However, the concentration at which we observed inhibition was much lower than that reported by Hansford et al. (20 μg/ml versus 50 μg/ml). Below 20 μg/ml, inhibition of hydrogen peroxide formation by PHPA was not observed (data not shown). Therefore, a final concentration of 10 μg/ml PHPA was selected to be used in the current study. Mitochondria from HL-60 cells were able to generate a low level of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2 A and Table I) in the presence of mitochondrial respiratory chain substrates, glutamate/malate for complex I and succinate for complex II. The mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone increased glutamate/malate-supported hydrogen peroxide formation. The concentration of rotenone capable of inducing mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation was closely related to the concentration that inhibited cell respiration. At low concentrations, cell respiration levels were highly sensitive to rotenone treatment. The respiration inhibition curve was very rapid with a nearly 80% decrease of cell respiration in the presence of 100 nm rotenone. Similarly, mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation increased quickly within the same rotenone concentration range. Respiration in cells treated with 0.5 μm rotenone was reduced to 4% of control levels. Higher concentrations of rotenone produced greater inhibition but a much slower decrease in cell respiration. Correspondingly, 0.5 μm rotenone stimulated the maximum rate of mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide production. Higher concentrations of rotenone did not further elevate this rate.Table IRotenone-induced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide productionSubstrateInhibitorRate of H2O2 productionnmol/min/mg proteinGlutamate (5 mm) + malate (5 mm)0.129 ± 0.049Glutamate (5 mm) + malate (5 mm)Rotenone (1 μm)5.524 ± 0.321Glutamate (5 mm) + malate (5 mm)Antimycin (1 μm)5.563 ± 0.314Succinate (5 mm)0.204 ± 0.052Succinate (5 mm)Rotenone (1 μm)0.105 ± 0.057Succinate (5 mm)Antimycin (1 μm)14.54 ± 1.213Mitochondria were isolated from HL-60 cells and incubated with various respiratory chain substrates and inhibitors.

Hydrogen peroxide produced by mitochondria was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” Mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide was converted to mnol of hydrogen peroxide produced per min per mg of mitochondrial protein. Values are means ± S.E., n = 3. Another mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitor, antimycin, was also able to stimulate mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation (Table I). However, antimycin could elevate both glutamate/malate- and succinate-supported mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation, while rotenone was shown to increase only glutamate/malate-supported hydrogen peroxide formation. To confirm that rotenone was able to induce mitochondrial ROS production, conversion of the ROS-sensitive dye hydroethidine to ethidium was used to measure cellular ROS level by flow cytometry (Fig.2 B). Using this technique, rotenone-induced ROS production was detected in single cells at the wholecell level. Rotenone was shown to elevate cellular ROS levels in HL-60 cells. In comparison with the dose-response curve of rotenone-induced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide formation, at the cellular level low concentrations of rotenone (<100 nm) could merely elevate the cellular ROS level. However, at high concentrations (≥500 nm) rotenone could significantly increase the cellular ROS level. To further investigate whether rotenone-induced cellular superoxide production was from mitochondria, HL-60 cells that lack mitochondrial DNA (ρ0) were treated with various concentrations of rotenone and then loaded with hydroethidine. Rotenone could not elevate ethidium fluorescence in ρ0 HL-60 cells after treatment for 1 h (Fig. 2 C), although ethidium fluorescence increased when normal HL-60 cells were treated with rotenone for the same length of time (Fig. 2 C). Using HL-60 cells as a model, we studied the effect of rotenone on cell death. After treatment with 1 μm rotenone for 36 h, ∼50% of the HL-60 cells showed chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation under confocal microscopy using Hoechst 33342 as DNA stain (Fig. 3). Cell cycle analysis based on flow cytometry was used to quantitatively estimate rotenone-induced apoptotic cell death. Gating of the subdiploid cell population on a linear scale excluded cells with extensive DNA degradation (typical of necrosis) to distinguish apoptotic cells from necrotic cells (45Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grunke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Google Scholar). Consistent with confocal microscope results, flow cytometry analysis revealed an increase in the subdiploid population after treatment with 1 μm rotenone for 36 h (55.3% compared with 6.7% of control). Agarose gel electrophoresis studies showed that 0.5–1 μm rotenone treatment resulted in a typical apoptotic-style DNA fragmentation with 30/50 kbp and 200/1000 bp oligonucleosomal fragments (Fig.4 A). In addition, the number of subdiploid cells increased in a concentration-dependent manner (Table II). Rotenone (0.5 μm) for 36 h induced ∼50% of cells to be subdiploid. Higher concentrations of rotenone did not produce more subdiploid cells than were induced by 0.5 μm rotenone (Table II).Figure 4Rotenone-induced DNA laddering and effect of caspase inhibitors on rotenone-induced apoptosis.

G protein coupling of GPR40 was examined in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the Gαq/i-responsive Gal4-Elk1 reporter system. Expression of human GPR40 led to a constitutive induction of luciferase activity, which was further increased by exposure of the cells to eicosatriynoic acid. Neither the constitutive nor ligand-mediated luciferase induction was inhibited by pertussis toxin treatment, suggesting that GPR40 was coupled to Gαq/11. Expression analysis by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR showed that GPR40 was specifically expressed in brain and pancreas, with expression in rodent pancreas being localized to insulin-producing β-cells. These data suggest that some of the physiological effects of fatty acids in pancreatic islets and brain may be mediated through a cell-surface receptor.

In the last decade, an increasing number of unliganded receptors, so-called orphan receptors, with unknown function have been identified, warranting much research into their biological role. GPR40 was cloned along with GPR41–43downstream of CD22 on human chromosomal locus 19q13.1 (1Sawzdargo M. George S.R. Nguyen T. Xu S.J. Kolakowski L.F. Odowd B.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 543-547Google Scholar). GPR40–43 belong to a subset of orphan receptors, which are more related to each other than to other liganded receptors, with GPR40 being 30% identical to GPR41 and GPR43. The group of GPCRs of which GPR40–43are members is thought to have evolved relatively recently and contains several gene duplications, of which GPR41 andGPR42 are examples (2Brown J.A. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M. Tcheang L. Daniels D. Muir A.I. Wigglesworth M.J. Kinghorn I. Fraser N.J. Pike N.B. Strum J.C. Steplewski K.M. Murdock P.R. Holder J.C. Marshall F.H. Szekeres P.G. Wilson S. Ignar D.M. Foord M.S. Wise A. Dowell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11312-11319Google Scholar). Fatty acids play an important physiological role in many tissues. Many effects attributable to fatty acids, such as impairment of insulin-mediated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in muscle (3Thompson A.L. Lim-Fraser M.Y.C. Kraegen E.W. Cooney G.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: E577-E584Google Scholar) and potentiation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic islets (4Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Google Scholar), have been attributed to their intracellular metabolism to long chain acyl-CoA esters. However, it is also conceivable that fatty acids may act at a cell-surface receptor because receptors for fatty acid derivatives such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been identified (5Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229Google Scholar, 6Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Halsey W. Sathe G. Muir A.I. Nuthulaganti P. Dytko G.M. Buckley P.T. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Hay D.W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 657-663Google Scholar). Moreover, there is significant homology between the GPR40–43 receptor family and the leukotriene receptor family. However, to date, no extracellular receptor for the fatty acids most prevalent in plasma (palmitate, oleate, stearate, linoleate, and linolenate) has been reported. Using a ligand fishing strategy, previously successful in identifying ligands for other orphan GPCRs (7Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Google Scholar), we demonstrate that medium and long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids can activate GPR40 in a dose-dependent manner. However, short chain fatty acids, shown to activate other family member receptors (GPR41 and GPR43), are inactive in cells expressing GPR40 (2Brown J.A. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M. Tcheang L. Daniels D. Muir A.I. Wigglesworth M.J. Kinghorn I. Fraser N.J. Pike N.B. Strum J.C. Steplewski K.M. Murdock P.R. Holder J.C. Marshall F.H. Szekeres P.G. Wilson S. Ignar D.M. Foord M.S. Wise A. Dowell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11312-11319Google Scholar). Pharmacological analysis of GPR40 and its tissue distribution suggests that the receptor may play a role in pancreatic β-cell and neurological function. We have therefore identified a potential novel mechanism by which fatty acids may elicit cellular responses in certain tissues. The human GPR40(hGPR40) receptor (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF024687) was cloned by PCR from human genomic DNA using nested oligonucleotide sense primers (5′-GATCTGAGGACAGGGAGCCAGGTTGCA-3′ and 5′-GGAGCCGTGCAGGCC AGGACG-3′) and antisense primers (5′-CCCTGCAGTTCCTCCGAAGCAGC-3′ and 5′-CATGCTCCTTCCCCCGAGCAG-3′) designed based on the genomic sequence of the hGPR40gene. Mouse Gpr40 was cloned by hybridization of the32P-radiolabeled human coding region to a mouse genomic phage library (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) under low stringency conditions as previously described (8Bergsma D.J. Eder C. Gross M. Kersten H. Sylvester D. Appelbaum E. Cusimano D. Livi G.P. McLaughlin M.M. Kasyan K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23204-23214Google Scholar). Positive clones were plaque-purified, digested with BamHI, and size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Southern blot analysis with the hGPR40 probe was used to identify a BamHI fragment that was subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). The subclones were sequenced (PerkinElmer Life Sciences); and one clone, designated mouse Gpr40g, contained an open reading frame of 300 amino acids with 83% identity to hGPR40. Oligonucleotides were designed to clone mouse Gpr40 from brain cDNA usingPfu Turbo (Stratagene). A sequence confirming the cDNA clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF539809) was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCDN (9Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M. Trill J.J. Ellis C. Bergsma D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 75-86Google Scholar). Rat Gpr40 was cloned using oligonucleotides designed in the regions of high homology between the human and mouse genes. A partial fragment of 435 bp was cloned from rat pancreatic and brain cDNAs and sequenced (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following confirmation that the clone was the rat ortholog to human and mouse genes, 5′- and 3′-RACE oligonucleotides were designed, and a full-length ratGpr40 cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAF539810) was cloned using Pfu Turbo. A sequence confirming the cDNA clone was subcloned into pCDN (9Aiyar N. Baker E. Wu H.L. Nambi P. Edwards R.M. Trill J.J. Ellis C. Bergsma D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 131: 75-86Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (v/v) and 2 mm glutamine. MIN6 cells (a gift from Professor J. Miyazaki (University of Tokyo, Japan) through Professor Kevin Docherty (University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK)) (10Miyazaki J. Araki K. Yamato E. Ikegami H. Asano T. Shibasaki Y. Oka Y. Yamamura K. Endocrinology. 1990; 127: 126-132Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 15% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. hGPR40 in pCDN was stably expressed in HEK293 cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clonal cell lines were generated by serial dilution into growth medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Stable CHO cells expressing hGPR40, a chimeric Gal4-Elk1 transcription factor, and a five-Gal4 promoter upstream of a luciferase reporter gene (hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells) were generated as follows. hGPR40 was expressed in stable Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+-expressing CHO cells (host cells) essentially as described (11Goetz A.S. Andrews J.L. Littleton T.R. Ignar D.M. J. Biomol. Screening. 2000; 5: 377-384Google Scholar) using a Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+puromycin vector (a gift from Erik Whitehorn, Affymax Corp., San Francisco, CA). Clones were selected in medium containing puromycin. After fluorescence-activated cell sorting and plating individual cells into 96-well plates, clones were chosen by response to thrombin (Sigma). 12 μg of hGPR40 vector was subsequently transfected into the Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ host cells essentially as described (11Goetz A.S. Andrews J.L. Littleton T.R. Ignar D.M. J. Biomol. Screening. 2000; 5: 377-384Google Scholar), except that clones were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 and chosen by response to 5,8,11-eicosatriynoic acid (ETA) (Sigma). HEK293 cells transiently or stably expressing GPR40 were seeded (50,000 cells/well) into poly-d-lysine-coated 96-well black-view, clear-bottom microtiter plates (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) 24 h prior to assay. Cells were loaded for 1 h with 1 μmFluo-4/AM fluorescent indicator dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Leiden, Netherlands) in assay buffer (Hanks' balanced salt solution, 10 mm HEPES, 200 μm Ca2+, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 2.5 mm probenecid), washed three times with assay buffer, and then returned to the incubator for 10 min before assay on a fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) (Molecular Devices, Wokingham, UK). Maximum change in fluorescence over the base line was used to determine agonist response. Cells were screened against a large library of >1500 known and putative GPCR agonists, including all known mammalian neuropeptides (tachykinins, neuromedins, etc.), bioactive lipids (leukotrienes, prostaglandins, etc.), steroids (aldosterone, testosterone, etc.), amines (catacholamines, etc.), cannabinoids (anandamide, etc.), nucleotides (ATP, ADP, UTP, etc.), and sugar nucleotides (UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, etc.). Peptides were tested at a final concentration of >100 nm and other ligands at >1 μm. Free fatty acids were purchased from Sigma. Concentration-response curve data were fitted to a four-parameter logistic equation using GraFit (Erithacus Software Ltd.). The reporter assay for the stable hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+-expressing CHO cells was carried out as follows. Forty-eight hours prior to assay, hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells were plated at a concentration of 10,000 cells/well in a 96-well black-view plate (Costar Corp.) in complete medium. Eighteen hours prior to the assay, the medium was replaced with 90 μl/well serum-free complete medium with or without 1 μg/ml pertussis toxin (PTX) (Calbiochem). ETA was made at 20 mm in 100% ethanol with subsequent dilutions accompanied by sonication. Oleoyllysophosphatidic acid (Sigma) was made in water. At the time of the assay, the medium was replaced with 90 μl of serum-free medium; 10 μl of ligand was added; and plates were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the medium was removed and replaced with 50 μl of a 1:1 mixture of LucPlusTM (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. Plates were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 10 min before luciferase activity was determined using a TopCountTM microplate scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using a count time of 3 s/well. Rat islets were prepared by a collagenase method (12Rorsman P. Trube G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 374: 531-550Google Scholar) from the pancreases of Wistar rats. Batches of human islets were isolated from heart-beating adult cadaver organ donors with informed consent and supplied by the Human Islet Facility at the University of Leicester (Leicester, UK). TaqMan quantitative PCR was performed on 1 ng of cDNA prepared from human tissues (Promega, Madison, WI) essentially as described previously (6Sarau H.M. Ames R.S. Chambers J. Ellis C. Elshourbagy N. Foley J.J. Schmidt D.B. Muccitelli R.M. Jenkins O. Murdock P.R. Herrity N.C. Halsey W. Sathe G. Muir A.I. Nuthulaganti P. Dytko G.M. Buckley P.T. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Hay D.W.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 657-663Google Scholar), using forward and reverse hGPR40-specific primers and probes (BIOSOURCE, International, Camarillo, CA). Primers and probes were designed using Primer Express software (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and are shown in Table I. Copy number was calculated from a standard curve, generated using sheared genomic DNA, assuming that 1 μg/μl sheared genomic DNA is equivalent to 6 × 105 “single-strand copies.” The data are presented as mRNA copies detected per ng of poly(A)+ RNA from four individuals (means ± S.E., n = 4). For the immune cell samples, TaqMan analysis was performed on 50 ng of total RNA extracted from samples from up to three individuals as described (2Brown J.A. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M. Tcheang L. Daniels D. Muir A.I. Wigglesworth M.J. Kinghorn I. Fraser N.J. Pike N.B. Strum J.C. Steplewski K.M. Murdock P.R. Holder J.C. Marshall F.H. Szekeres P.G. Wilson S. Ignar D.M. Foord M.S. Wise A. Dowell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11312-11319Google Scholar). Relative abundance in these samples is expressed as 2ΔCt to reflect the exponential nature of PCR. The ΔCt = 40 cycles − the threshold cycle (Ct). The Ct value is the cycle number at which the reporter fluorescence, generated by cleavage of the probe, passes a fixed threshold above the base line. The Ct occurs in the exponential phase of PCR when none of the reaction components are limiting. We used an arbitrary cutoff of 40 cycles as a reference. In other words, each cycle represents an ∼2-fold difference in mRNA abundance.Table IpEC50 values of fatty acids tested in HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR40Fatty acidpEC50Fatty acidpEC50Fatty acidpEC50mean ± S.E.mean ± S.E.mean ± S.E.A.n-Caproic acid (C6H12O2)4.33Lauric acid (dodecanoic acid (C12H24O2)4.92 ± 0.09Stearic acid (C18H36O2)4.78 ± 0.04Heptanoic acid (C7H14O2)4.28Tridecanoic acid (C13H26O2)4.93 ± 0.07Nonadecanoic acid (C19H38O2)4.52Caprylic acid (C8H16O2)4.42Myristic acid (C14H28O2)4.84 ± 0.16Arachidic acid (C20H40O2)4.21Nonanoic acid (C9H18O2)4.40Pentadeconoic acid (C15H30O2)5.18 ± 0.11Heneicosanoic acid (C21H42O2)4.49Capric acid (C10H20O2)4.85 ± 0.06Palmitic acid (C16H32O2)5.30 ± 0.12Behenic acid (docosanoic acid (C22H44O2)4.30Undecanoic acid (C11H22O2)4.70 ± 0.07Heptadecanoic acid (C17H34O2)4.99 ± 0.07Tricosanoic acid (C23H46O2)4.31B.Mead acid (10:3n-9)5.6 ± 0.10All-trans-retinal (vitamin A aldehyde (C20H28O)4.16Eicosa-11Z,14Z-dienoic acid (20:2n-6)4.97 ± 0.189Z-Palmitoleic acid (C16H30O2)4.86 ± 0.05All-trans-Retinoic acid (vitamin A acid, tretinoin C20H28O2)5.58 ± 0.04Eicosa-11Z,14Z,17Z-trienoic acid (20:3n-3)4.95 ± 0.039Z, 12Z, 15Z-Linolenic acid (C18H30O2)4.90 ± 0.139-cis-Retinoic acid (9-cis-tretinoin C20H28O2)4.40Eicosa-5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z-pentaenoic acid (20:5n-3)5.17 ± 0.08γ-Linolenic acid (18:3n-6)5.05 ± 0.125Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-Arachidonic acid (C20H32O2)4.92 ± 0.12Dihomo-γ linolenic acid (20:3 n-6)5.14 ± 0.129Z,12Z-Linoleic acid (C18H32O2)5.02 ± 0.16(14R,15S)-DiHETE4.63Docosa-13Z,16Z,19Z-trienoic acid (22:3n-3)5.17 ± 0.059E-Elaidic acid (C18H34O2)5.16 ± 0.0717-Octadecynoic acid (C18H32O2)5.12 ± 0.34Docosa-7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-pentaenoic acid (22:5n-3)5.33 ± 0.179Z-Oleic acid (C18H34O2)4.395,8,11-Eicosatriynoic acid (C20H28O2)5.71 ± 0.11cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-Docosahexaenoic acid (C22H32O2)5.37 ± 0.106Z-Petroselinic acid (C18H34O2)5.00 ± 0.02Eicosa-5Z,8Z-dienoic acid (20:2n-12)5.11 ± 0.04Adrenic acid (22:4n-6)4.87 ± 0.22Receptor activation was measured from dose-dependent changes in [Ca2+]i using FLIPR. pEC50 values of active saturated (Part A) and unsaturated (Part B) fatty acids are listed.

Pancreatic RNA was extracted from 20-week-old ob/ob and lean mice by acid guanidine/thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction, with expression of GPR40 in pancreas performed using TaqMan primers and probes (PE Applied Biosystems) designed across mouse and rat Gpr40genes (Table I). A 587-base probe was generated by reverse transcription-PCR from the full-length clone of rat Gpr40 and subcloned into the transcription vector pGEM-T (Promega). After cloning, the vector was linearized with the restriction enzyme SpeI, followed by the generation of radiolabeled antisense transcripts using T7 RNA polymerase and [33P]ribonucleotideUTP (800 Ci/mol; Amersham Biosciences). Sense control probes were generated by linearization withNcoI, followed by transcription with SP6 polymerase. Whole rat pancreas was obtained by rapid necropsy, fixed in neutral buffered 10% Formalin for 24 h, and embedded in paraffin. The tissues were sectioned at 6 μm, mounted on plus slides, deparaffinized, rehydrated, and then pretreated with 0.2 mHCl for 10 min, followed by digestion with 10 μg/ml proteinase K for 20 min. After dehydrating and drying, the sections were prehybridized for 2 h in 50% prehybridization mixture (600 mm NaCl, 40 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 2× Denhardt's solution, 0.4% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 μg/ml tRNA) and 50% formamide at 55 °C. The probes (2 × 106 cpm/section) were mixed with hybridization solution (2× hybridization mixture and 20% dextran sulfate in formamide, 1:1 (v/v)) and hybridized overnight at 55 °C. The following morning, the sections were then washed at 55 °C with 5× SSC for 1 h and with 0.1× SSC for 30 min, digested with RNase A (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min, washed again with 0.1× SSC at 55 °C for 30 min, and dehydrated. After drying, the slides were dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion, exposed for 4 weeks, developed with Kodakd-19 developer, counterstained with hematoxylin, and examined by both dark-field and light-field microscopy. Immunohistochemical staining for insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin was performed using a Ventana Nexus automated stainer with all Ventana reagents (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ). An enhanced 3,3′-diaminobenzidine kit was used for detection, and sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For each concentration of ligand used in reporter assays, one-way analysis of variance was performed. Comparison of pEC50 values was performed using Student'st test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. We transiently transfected HEK293 cells with hGPR40 and screened these cells for their ability to increase intracellular calcium using a FLIPK against a large library of >1500 known and putative natural GPCR agonists. Elaidic acid (C18H34O2) was the only ligand found in the library to specifically activate the receptor compared with cells transiently expressing other GPCRs (Fig.1 A). Further testing of other fatty acids in HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR40 demonstrated that a range of medium to long chain saturated and unsaturated fatty acids,e.g. elaidic acid, palmitic acid, and ETA, were able to increase intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas short chain fatty acids with carbon chain lengths greater than six, e.g. succinic acid and formic acid, produced no response (Fig. 1 B). pEC50 values for both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids for the elevation of intracellular calcium in HEK293 cells are shown in Table I. The most potent saturated fatty acids were those with carbon chain lengths of 15 and 16, whereas of all the fatty acids tested, ETA was the most potent, with a pEC50 of 5.71. We stably transfected hGPR40 into a stable CHO cell line containing a Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ reporter. Following activation of MAPK, the chimeric Gal4-Elk1 transcription factor is phosphorylated and activated and binds to the Gal4 upstream activating sequence, resulting in induction of luciferase expression (14Ignar D.M. Rees S. Kenokin J. Angus J.A. Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 148. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2000Google Scholar). MAPK activation can occur downstream of signaling pathways initiated by receptors coupled to either Gαi/o or Gαq/11. The signaling pathways involved can, however, be inferred through the use of PTX, which ADP-ribosylates Gαi/o, preventing its interaction with receptors while having no effect on Gαq/11 (15Bokoch G.M. Katada T. Northup J.K. Hewlett E.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2072-2075Google Scholar). The hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells exhibited a significantly higher basal luciferase activity compared with host cells lacking hGPR40 (p < 0.01) (Fig.2 A). Pretreatment with PTX decreased basal luciferase activity in both host cells and cells expressing GPR40 to a similar extent (luciferase activity in PTX-treated cells as percent of untreated cells (means ± S.E.,n = three experiments): host cells, 52.9 ± 9; and GPR40-expressing cells, 44.2 ± 1.2). These data suggest that some of the basal luciferase activity present in both host cells and hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells was due to the constitutive activity of endogenous Gαi/o-coupled receptors. Luciferase activity remained significantly higher in hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells compared with host cells even after PTX treatment. This residual activity may be due to the constitutive activity of GPR40 resulting from coupling to Gαq/11. Similar results in melanophores, showing the constitutive activity of GPR40 resulting from coupling to Gαq/11, support this finding (data not shown). To investigate the G protein coupling of GPR40 following ligand binding and activation, hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells were treated with the fatty acid ETA, the most potent ligand for hGPR40 from the initial ligand pairing screen performed in HEK293 cells (Table I). As a positive control, cells were also treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which binds to an endogenous Gαi-coupled receptor (16Hordijk P.L. Verlaan I. Vancorven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 645-651Google Scholar). All treatments were performed following an overnight treatment of PTX or vehicle. ETA (3 μm) produced a maximum 3.3-fold response over the control in hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ cells (Fig.2 B). Responses to 3 μm ETA in four other hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ clones characterized ranged from 3.3- to 7.4-fold (data not shown). No significant induction of luciferase activity was observed in host cells at any concentration of ETA tested (Fig. 2 B). LPA in the host cells had a pEC50 of 5.51 ± 0.01 and produced a 13.5-fold response over basal levels at 2.5 μm (Fig.2 C). The response to LPA was essentially abolished by PTX treatment. However, PTX did not inhibit the induction of luciferase activity by ETA in hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+cells at any concentration tested, nor did PTX treatment significantly change the pEC50 (without PTX, 5.92 ± 0.05; with PTX, 5.99 ± 0.01). Furthermore, there was a trend for an increase in ETA-stimulated luciferase activity following PTX treatment, suggesting that the Gαq/11-mediated activation of the luciferase reporter was dampened by a Gαi/0 component. Similar potentiation of the response to ETA was observed in three of four other hGPR40-Gal4-Elk1/5xGal4-luc+ clones, whereas in the fourth clone, PTX had no effect (neither inhibitory nor stimulatory) on ETA-stimulated luciferase activity (data not shown). To evaluate the physiological role of GPR40, we performed real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR using TaqMan in a variety of human tissues from one to four individuals. Specific expression was observed in pancreas and brain (Fig. 3). Further analysis of expression of hGPR40 in brain regions revealed ubiquitous expression in the areas examined, with the highest expression in the substantia nigra and medulla oblongata. Analysis of GPR40 expression in immune cells from one to three individuals showed that, in contrast to hGPR43, no expression of GPR40 was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, B-lymphocytes, or neutrophils (2Brown J.A. Goldsworthy S.M. Barnes A.A. Eilert M.M. Tcheang L. Daniels D. Muir A.I. Wigglesworth M.J. Kinghorn I. Fraser N.J. Pike N.B. Strum J.C. Steplewski K.M. Murdock P.R. Holder J.C. Marshall F.H. Szekeres P.G. Wilson S. Ignar D.M. Foord M.S. Wise A. Dowell S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11312-11319Google Scholar). Expression ofGPR40 was detected in monocytes, although at relatively low levels compared with that of GPR43. Because the analysis ofGPR40 and GPR43 expression was performed in the same immune cell samples, the data show that there is clear differential expression between these two receptors in immune cells. As the pancreas is composed of exocrine cells and endocrine islet cells, with the islets making up only 2% of the pancreas, the level of hGPR40 expression in the pancreas was compared with that in human islets. In four independent islet samples, there was a 2–100-fold higher expression of GPR40 than in total pancreas for an equivalent RNA input, with a mean -fold increase in expression of 36.8 ± 25.4 compared with that in total pancreas. These data suggest that pancreatic expression of GPR40 may be localized to human pancreatic islets. Islets contain four cell types (α, β, δ, and PP), of which the insulin-secreting β-cells make up >80% of the islet. To further investigate the localization of Gpr40 in islets, rat and mouseGpr40 were cloned. At the DNA level, rat and mouseGpr40 are 94% identical to each other and 75 and 76% identical to hGPR40, respectively. At the protein level, rat and mouse GPR40 are 95% identical to each other and 82 and 83% identical to the human receptor, respectively. To investigate how expression of Gpr40 changes in a rodent model of obesity and insulin resistance, expression in whole pancreases ofob/ob mice was examined.ob/ob mice are obese, hyperglycemic, and insulin-resistant and exhibit β-cell hyperplasia due to the increased demand on the cells for insulin (17Coleman D.L. Diabetologia. 1978; 14: 141-148Google Scholar). Using TaqMan primers specific to rat and mouse Gpr40 (Table II), significant increases in expression of Gpr40 mRNA were detected in whole pancreases of ob/ob mice compared with control lean mice. Although the increases in Gpr40 mRNA expression were less than those of insulin (-fold change relative to lean controls (n = two experiments, 5–10 animals/group): Gpr40, 6.5 ± 1.3; and insulin, 10.2 ± 0.9), these data suggest that the increased expression ofGpr40 may be due in part to the increased β-cell number manifest in the pancreas of this animal model. To verify the islet localization of Gpr40, TaqMan RT-PCR was performed in rat and mouse islets and in a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6) using species-specific primers. Table IIIshows that Gpr40 was expressed in both rat and mouse islets and in MIN6 cells. In sit"

The molecular mechanisms that control nano-sized magnetite crystal formation and the generation of diverse morphologies are not well understood. From the analysis of magnetite crystal-associated proteins, several low molecular mass proteins tightly bound to bacterial magnetite were obtained from Magnetospirillum magneticumstrain AMB-1. These proteins showed common features in their amino acid sequences, which contain hydrophobic N-terminal and hydrophilic C-terminal regions. The C-terminal regions in Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13 contain dense carboxyl and hydroxyl groups that bind iron ions. Nano-sized magnetic particles similar to those in magnetic bacteria were prepared by chemical synthesis of magnetite in the presence of the acidic protein Mms6.

Blakemore R.P. Wolfe R.S. Science. 1979; 203: 1355-1356Google Scholar, 2Sakaguchi T. Burgess J.G. Matsunaga T. Nature. 1993; 365: 47-49Google Scholar, 3Mann S. Sparks N.H.C. Frankel R.B. Bazylinski D.A. Jannasch H.W. Nature. 1990; 343: 258-261Google Scholar). These particles are individually covered with a stable lipid bilayer membrane that mainly consists of lipid and protein (4Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Google Scholar). The mineral size, type, and morphology of bacterial magnetic particles (BMPs)1 are highly controlled within bacterial species or strains (5Spring S. Schleifer K.H. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 147-153Google Scholar). The species-specific control of BMP formation has focused attention on the possible roles of the surrounding membrane structures. The molecular mechanism of BMP synthesis is a multistep process, including vesicle formation, iron transport, and magnetite crystallization (5Spring S. Schleifer K.H. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 147-153Google Scholar, 6Schüler D. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 79-86Google Scholar). Recent molecular studies have postulated the steps of BMP synthesis (7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar, 8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar, 9Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-28396Google Scholar). Several proteins located on or in the BMP membrane have been isolated and analyzed in Magnetospirillum magneticum strain AMB-1. The first event of BMP synthesis is the formation of vesicles. Invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane is primed by a BMP membrane-specific GTPase (Mms16) to form the intracellular vesicle (7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar). MpsA, a homolog of an acetyltransferase containing a CoA-binding motif, is also considered to be involved in this process (8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar). The second process in BMP synthesis is iron transport into the BMP vesicles. It appears that ferric iron is reduced on the cell surface, taken into the cytoplasm, transported into the BMP vesicle, and finally oxidized to produce magnetite. The magAgene was isolated through transposon mutagenesis in strain AMB-1 (9Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-28396Google Scholar). This gene encodes an integral membrane protein that is involved in the transport of iron into the BMP vesicles. The last process is crystallization of magnetite within the vesicle, but the process remains unclear. Other proteins associated with the BMP membrane have been partially characterized in magnetic bacteria to date. Gorby et al. (4Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Google Scholar) observed two specific proteins in the BMP membrane fromMagnetospirillum magnetotacticum MS-1. Okuda et al. (10Okuda Y. Denda K. Fukumori Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 99-102Google Scholar) identified three additional specific proteins and determined the nucleotide/amino acid sequence of a 22-kDa protein. From motif analysis, this is considered to function as a receptor interacting with associated cytoplasmic proteins (11Okuda Y. Fukumori Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 169-173Google Scholar). Recently, Grünberg et al. (12Grünberg K. Wawer C. Tebo B.M. Schüler D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4573-4582Google Scholar) cloned and sequenced four genes that were assigned to two different genomic regions coding for BMP membrane-specific proteins in Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense MSR-1. To understand the molecular mechanism of magnetite crystallization inM. magneticum AMB-1, several proteins tightly bound to the bacterial magnetite crystals were isolated and characterized. A new class of mineral-associated proteins that may have important roles in the initiation of nucleation and magnetite crystal growth is described. Escherichia colistrains DH5α and BL21 were used for gene cloning and protein expression, respectively. E. coli cells were cultured in Luria broth at 37 °C after adding appropriate antibiotics. M. magneticum AMB-1 (ATCC700264) was grown anaerobically in an 8-liter fermentor as described previously (13Yang C.D. Takeyama H. Tanaka T. Matsunaga T. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2001; 29: 13-19Google Scholar). BMPs were extracted from 8 liters of fed-batch culture and washed 20 times with HEPES (pH 7.0). The other cell fractions were also prepared as described previously (8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar). The purified BMPs were treated three times with 800 μl of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, and 40 mm Tris base solution with weak sonication to remove membrane-associated proteins and washed with HEPES several times. To isolate the tightly bound proteins, BMPs were treated three times with 800 μl of 1% (w/v) SDS in a 100 °C water bath for 30 min. During this process, the sample was treated briefly in an ultrasonic bath. After several washings, BMPs were treated with 20 ml of 2 m hydrofluoric acid plus 8 m ammonium hydrofluoride solution (pH 5.0). The dissolved material was dialyzed several times against 4 liters of fresh HEPES. The sample was precipitated by the same volume of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 400 μl of 0.1% SDS solution. The amount of protein on BMPs was evaluated using a modified Lowry method (14Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Google Scholar). One-hundred microliters of 1 n NaOH and 0.02% (w/v) SDS solution was added to 1 mg of BMPs and incubated in a 100 °C water bath for 10 min. After the BMPs were removed by centrifugation, the supernatant was used to measure the protein amount using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein concentrations in solution were measured using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and adjusted before electrophoresis. Each fraction was mixed in the same volume of 2× sample buffer (0.125 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% mercaptoethanol, 4% SDS, 10% sucrose, and 0.004% bromphenol blue) and denatured by boiling. A 3% stacking gel and a 15% resolving gel were used according to the method of Laemmli (15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Tricine/SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Schägger and von Jagow (16Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or SYPRO Ruby (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The molecular mass was calculated from a standard linear regression curve using a low molecular mass calibration kit (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and polypeptide SDS-PAGE molecular mass standards (Bio-Rad). Western analysis was performed by electroblotting polyacrylamide gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM-P, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The membranes were immunostained with mouse anti-His monoclonal antibody (cat no. 34670, QIAGEN GmbH) at a 1:5000 dilution and developed with alkaline phosphatase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (cat no. 59296, ICN Biomedicals Inc., Aurora, OH). Two-dimensional PAGE was carried out by the method of O'Farrel (17O'Farrel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar). The first dimension was carried out with immobilized dry strip gels (pH 3–10; 130 mm) using the electrophoresis apparatus immobilized pH gradients Phor II (Amersham Biosciences). The strips were rehydrated with buffer containing of 7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 40 mm Tris base, 19.4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% (v/v) carrier ampholytes (Amersham Biosciences), and traces of bromphenol blue at 20 °C for 12 h. The strips were run with the following program: step 1, 500 V for 2 h; step 2, 1000 V for 2 h; step 3, 8000 V (gradient) for 4 h; and step 4, 8000 V (hold) for 2 h. The second dimension was carried out with Tricine/SDS gels as described above. The two-dimensional gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. CarbamylyteTM calibration markers (Amersham Biosciences) were used to estimate the pI of the proteins. After gel electrophoresis, gels were electroblotted onto ImmobilonTM-PSQ (Millipore Corp.). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, and identified protein spots were excised. Amino acid sequencing of the proteins/peptides was performed by automated Edman degradation using a Shimadzu PPSQ-1 amino acid sequencing system. Oligonucleotide primers were designed using the N-terminal amino acid sequence. The codon usage pattern of previously reported proteins in strain AMB-1 was used (7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar, 8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar, 9Nakamura C. Burgess J.G. Sode K. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28392-28396Google Scholar). Gene walking was performed to obtain the entire gene encoding the Mms5 and Mms6 proteins. Primer S1 (CAGGCCCTTGCCGGTCCAGATGGT) and primer S2 (ATCATCCTGGGCGTTGTTGGCGCC) were used to amplify the mms6 region. Primer S3 (GTGCTGCTGGGCGTGGTCGGCGTG) and primer S4 (CACGCCGACCACGCCCAGCAGCAC) were designed for the mms5 region. To sequence themms7–13 region, primer mms7–13F (GCCTAACCAAATCCAGATGAG) and primer mms7–13R (CCGTAAGGAAAGACAGACACG) were designed from the genome sequence data of M. magneticumAMB-1. 2T. Matsunaga, Y. Okamura, A. T. Wahyudi, Y. Fukuda, and H. Takeyama, manuscript in preparation. The other primers for sequencing the region containing mam7,mam13, and mms6 were designed from the same data base. The preliminary sequence data of M. magnetotacticumMS-1 obtained from the DOE Joint Genome Institute 3Available at www.jgi.doe.gowv/tempweb/JGI_microbial/html/index.html. was used for comparison. The amplified PCR fragment was cloned into the pGEM-T-easy vector (pGEM-T-easy vector system, Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced using ABI PRISM 377 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The computer software package LASERGENE (DNASTAR, Inc. Madison, WI) was used for DNA and protein sequence analyses. The sequence was further analyzed by performing homology searches using the programs FASTA and BLAST against the GenBankTM/EBI DNA Data Bank. The recombinant plasmid pET15b-mms6, containing the sequence coding the mature Mms6 protein, was constructed by cloning PCR products into the expression vector pET15b. The primer set 5′-GGGGGACATATGGTCGGTGGAACCATCTGGACCGGTAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGGATCCAAATCAGGCCAGCGCGTCGCGCAGTTCGAC-3′ was used for amplification of the mms6 gene from AMB-1 genomic DNA.E. coli BL21 cells were cultured in 200 ml of Luria broth at 37 °C under isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction. The recombinant protein was purified under denaturing conditions using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN). The eluted protein was diluted in the same volume of refolding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 m l-arginine, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.8 mm oxidized glutathione (pH 8.0)). The purified protein was renatured by dialysis in 0.5 liter of buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, and 0.01 mEDTA (pH 8.0)) containing 4 and 2 m urea for 3 h each. Final dialysis was performed overnight in 1 liter without urea. The protein was further dialyzed for 3 h several times against 1 liter of fresh Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). All dialysis steps were performed at 4 °C. The His tag of the recombinant protein was digested with thrombin (QIAGEN) and then removed by filtration using a miniprep Microcon YM-3 membrane (Millipore Corp.). The blotting technique for detecting the iron-binding ability of Mms6 was performed according to Chen and Drysdale (18Chen Y. Drysdale J. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 47-49Google Scholar). 55FeCl3 was used instead of59FeCl3 in the same procedure. After blotting 0.3 nmol of proteins, the nitrocellulose membrane was rinsed with metal-binding buffer (0.02 m Tris-HCl and 0.15m NaCl (pH 7.0)) for 30 min. The membrane was then immersed in 5 ml of the same buffer containing 0.05 mCi/ml55FeCl3 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The total iron concentration in the solution was adjusted to 8.16 μg/ml by adding FeCl3. Unbound iron ion was removed by washing the membrane with metal-binding buffer three times for 30 min. The membrane was wrapped and exposed to x-ray film. Equine spleen apoferritin (Calbiochem) and bovine serum albumin were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Competitive iron binding was performed using 0.1 nmol of proteins. The membrane was immersed in 2 ml of metal-binding buffer with 0.05 mCi/ml 55FeCl3in the absence or presence of competing ions, including 1 mm FeCl3, 10 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmCuCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NiCl2, and 10 mmZnCl2. Autoradiography was done for 3 h. Purified recombinant Mms6 was used for magnetite formation by coprecipitation (19Kitayama M. Bull. Inst. Chem. Res. Kyoto Univ. 1969; 47: 607-612Google Scholar). Recombinant Mms6 (2 μg) was added to 100 μl of solution containing 33 mm ferrous sulfate and 33 mm ferric chloride. The solution was titrated very slowly using 0.1 n NaOH solution with sparging argon gas. A transmission electron microscope (H700-H, Hitachi, Tokyo) was used to observe the particle size and morphology. The sample was applied to carbon-coated 150-mesh copper grids (Nisshin EM Co., Ltd., Tokyo), dried overnight at room temperature, and stored with silica gel desiccant. The magnetic particles were visualized at 150 keV. Electron diffraction was performed using an analytical microscope (JEM-2000FX, Jeol Ltd., Tokyo). After extraction and purification, ∼200 mg of BMPs was obtained from an 8-liter fermentor. The presence of membranes encapsulating the BMPs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig.1 A). Results from the protein assay showed that the membrane proteins constituted 3% of the total mass weight of BMPs. By treating BMPs with a solution containing 7m urea, 2 m thiourea, and 4% CHAPS with weak sonication, 60% of the proteins were extracted. As previously reported, Mms24 (identical to MAM22) (20Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2000; 84–86: 441-446Google Scholar), MpsA (8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar), and Mms16 (7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar) were observed in this fraction (Fig.2 A, lane 1). The residual 40% of the proteins associated with BMPs could not be extracted using the same solution. To strip these tightly associated proteins, BMPs were immersed three times in boiling 1% SDS solution. Over 95% of the proteins were removed, and aggregations of naked BMPs were observed (Fig. 1 B). The protein profile of the 1% SDS fraction showed that it consisted mainly of low molecular mass proteins (<15 kDa) (Fig. 2 A, lane 4). For amino acid sequencing, the same protein sample was subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Four prominent spots were identified in the gel (Fig. 2 B). The residual magnetite was dissolved in 2m hydrofluoric acid plus 8 m ammonium hydrofluoride solution (pH 5.0) to identify any embedded proteins in the bacterial magnetite after protein removal with boiling 1% SDS solution. The magnetite was dissolved completely, and some compounds were observed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1 D). No protein bands were observed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 A,lane 5), suggesting that proteins exist on or near the surface of the crystals, but not within the magnetites. The proteins tightly bound to BMPs were further characterized to understand their roles in magnetite crystallization.Figure 2Identification of proteins tightly bound to BMPs by SDS-PAGE.

From the obtained sequences, a spot with an approximate molecular mass of 13 kDa (pI 7.2) was determined as a homolog of MamC in M. gryphiswaldense (12Grünberg K. Wawer C. Tebo B.M. Schüler D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4573-4582Google Scholar). The molecular size visualized by Tricine/SDS matched the reported size of MamC. The protein was designated as Mms13. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the spots at 5 kDa (pI 6.1), 6 kDa (pI 4.5), and 7 kDa (pI 5.9) showed high degrees of homology to each other and were designated as Mms5, Mms6, and Mms7, respectively. These proteins have the common sequence LGLGLGLGAWGPXXLGXXGXAGA. However, from several sequencing trials, we concluded that these are different proteins. Mms7 is homologous to the C-terminal part of MamD in M. gryphiswaldense. It was reported that the apparent mass of MamD on the SDS gel and the molecular mass calculated from the predictedmamD gene are different (12Grünberg K. Wawer C. Tebo B.M. Schüler D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4573-4582Google Scholar). These results suggest the existence of proteolytic cleavage of MamD. The obtained sequence most probably is the remnant of MamD after proteolytic digestion.Table IN-terminal amino acid sequences of tightly bound BMP proteinsProteinN-terminal amino acid sequenceMms13 (MamC)PFHLAPXLAKSVPGVGVLGALVGGAAALXKNVRLLKEKRITMms7 (MamD)AKGLGLGLGLGLGAWGPFLLGAAGLMms6GGTIWTGKGLGLGLGLGLGAWGPIILGVVGAGAVYAMms5SLGLGLGLGAWGPVLLGVVGVAGAI Open table in a new tab Based on the obtained amino acid sequences, primers were designed for the gene sequencing of Mms5 and Mms6. Complete DNA fragments coding open reading frames were obtained from the AMB-1 genome. Putative sequence for the ribosome-binding site and several promoter regions were found upstream of the start codon. FASTA and BLAST searches showed that the obtained nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Mms5 and Mms6 have no significant similarity, except to MamD. Interestingly, mms6, mms7, andmms13 are located closely (within a 3.2-kilobase pair region) in the AMB-1 genome (Fig. 3). The gene homolog of mms6 was also found in the genome sequence of MS-1 obtained from the data base. The amino acid sequence alignment of Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13 between M. magneticum AMB-1 andM. magnetotacticum MS-1 revealed 100, 81, and 80% similarities, respectively. No motifs were identified in all four proteins. The gene encoding Mms5 was not found in the genome sequence of MS-1 obtained from the data base. The amino acid sequence of Mms6 deduced from the full-length 399-bp gene is shown in Fig. 4. The sequence encodes a 12.5-kDa premature polypeptide. The N-terminal sequence obtained directly from the purified protein is completely contained within this deduced sequence. A predicted signal peptide presumed to mediate secretion, followed by a propeptide, was found using the SOSUI program (21Hirokawa T. Chieng S.B. Mitaku S. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 378-379Google Scholar). However, there was a gap between the signal peptidase cleavage site and the N-terminal sequence obtained by Edman degradation. This may be due to digestion by some specific proteases after protein secretion. The N-terminal region contains hydrophobic amino acids, and computer analysis suggests that this is a transmembrane region. However, the C-terminal region of Mms6 is highly acidic, consistent with a pI of 4.5. Amino acids containing hydroxyl groups were also observed. Furthermore, the region between the middle and C-terminal regions contains basic amino acids such as Lys, Tyr, and Arg. These structural features were also observed in Mms5, Mms7, and Mms13. The consensus sequences among these proteins are shown in Fig.5. The hydrophilic domains in mineral-associated proteins capture metal ions (22Hattan S.J. Laue T.M. Chasteen N.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4461-4468Google Scholar, 23Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Google Scholar), as previously reported.Figure 5Sequence alignment and comparison of Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mam13. A, hydrophobic region;B, hydrophilic region. Conserved residues are boxed. Thenumbers represent amino acid positions in the mature proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Recombinant Mms6 was produced in E. coli BL21. The gene encoding the mature peptide of Mms6 (6 kDa) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pET15b vector. The pET15b-mms6 plasmid was then transformed intoE. coli and overexpressed. The His-tagged protein was purified from the cell lysate using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column. The N-terminal amino acid of the purified protein was sequenced and confirmed that the desired protein was expressed in E. coli. The protein was reconstituted, and the His tag was removed by thrombin digestion. The protein sample after each step was checked by gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using anti-His antibody (Fig. 6). The expected sizes of His-tagged (7.5 kDa) and thrombin-digested (6 kDa) proteins were determined. The iron-binding ability of Mms6 was found both in the presence and absence of the His tag (Fig. 7 A). This indicates that the observed iron binding is mainly derived from Mms6, not from the His tag. In contrast, bovine serum albumin did not show iron-binding capability. Addition of 10 mm nonradioactive Fe3+ blocked the binding of radioactive Fe3+ to both Mms6 and ferritin (Fig. 7 B). Inhibition of binding of radioactive Fe3+ to Mms6 (but not to ferritin) was also observed in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. This binding inhibition was scarcely observed in the presence of Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+. To determine the effect of Mms6 on crystal formation, artificial magnetite was synthesized. At the beginning of titration, we observed a yellow-to-white precipitate, which changed to dark green and finally to black at neutral pH. The magnetic iron precipitates produced in the presence of Mms6 showed cuboidal morphology, with sizes ranging from 20 to 30 nm (Fig. 8 A). The results of electron diffraction analysis indicated that the black particles were composed mainly of magnetites (data not shown). The shape of the crystalline magnetites was similar to that of BMPs synthesized in M. magneticum AMB-1. Furthermore, the magnetic particles produced in the absence of Mms6 were non-homogeneous in size (1–100 nm) and shape (Fig. 8 B). The observed needle-shaped crystals are similar to α-FeOOH. Organic molecules acting as templates that facilitate crystal formation have been isolated from demineralized materials (25Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Direct evidence of biomineral formations by proteins has been reported in calcium carbonate (26Murayama E. Takagi Y. Ohira T. Davis J.G. Greene M.I. Nagasawa H. Eur. J.

Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Google Scholar). Although extraction of the proteins associated with BMPs has been examined using SDS (4Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Google Scholar, 10Okuda Y. Denda K. Fukumori Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 99-102Google Scholar, 12Grünberg K. Wawer C. Tebo B.M. Schüler D. Appl.

Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2000; 84–86: 441-446Google Scholar) solutions, no direct evidence of magnetite crystal formation by the proteins has been shown. In this study, several different protein fractions were separated by sequential treatment with urea, boiling SDS, and hydrofluoric acid. Peripheral proteins such as Mms24 (MAM22) (10Okuda Y. Denda K. Fukumori Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 171: 99-102Google Scholar, 20Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. Appl. Biochem. Biotechnol. 2000; 84–86: 441-446Google Scholar), MpsA (8Matsunaga T. Tsujimura N. Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 932-937Google Scholar), and Mms16 (7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar) and transmembrane proteins were removed by treatment with a urea-based solution. Four proteins (Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13) were observed in the same fraction as minor components upon two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The four protein spots were dominant in the fraction obtained by boiling SDS treatment. The protein solution showed a yellowish color, and the presence of iron was confirmed. Transmission electron microscopy showed no differences in the size and shape of BMPs before and after this treatment, indicating that only the surfaces of the particles were degraded. The presence of some specific interaction is suggested between these proteins and BMP surfaces. Furthermore, because protein was not observed in the BMP crystal core, the proteins bound to the surface play important roles in crystal formation. The four proteins (Mms5, Mms6, Mms7, and Mms13) showed no sequence similarities to known functional proteins. The only observed similarity was to the BMP membrane proteins MamC and MamD, reported in M. gryphiswaldense (12Grünberg K. Wawer C. Tebo B.M. Schüler D. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4573-4582Google Scholar). Common features observed within their sequences may describe a structural property. The proteins are mainly composed of two domains, hydrophobic N-terminal and hydrophilic C-terminal regions. The organic matrix surrounding the BMP crystal consists of a lipid bilayer membrane (4Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Google Scholar, 7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar). The hydrophobic peptide of the N-terminal transmembrane region may be integrated into the lipid bilayer. The dense carboxyl and hydroxyl groups in the C-terminal regions may interact directly with the mineral surface. For the proteins that directly interact with biominerals, two plausible functions are suggested: (i) initiation of crystal nucleation (25Shimizu K. Cha J. Stucky G.D. Morse D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6234-6238Google Scholar, 27Mann K. Weiss I.M. Andre S. Gabius H.-J. Fritz M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5257-5264Google Scholar,30Kröger N. Deutzmann R. Sumper M. Science. 1999; 286: 1129-1132Google Scholar) and (ii) inhibition and regulation of crystal growth (24Raj P.A. Johnsson M. Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Google Scholar, 31Lakshminarayanan R. Kini R.M. Valiyaveettil S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5155-5159Google Scholar) and determination of morphology (32Wheeler A.P. Suga S. Watanabe N. Hard Tissue Mineralization and Demineralization. Springer-Verlag Tokyo, Tokyo1992: 171-187Google Scholar, 33Kröger N. Lorenz S. Brunner E. Sumper M. Science. 2002; 298: 584-586Google Scholar). The initiation starts from the interaction and accumulation of metal ions on or in the organic molecules. The acidic groups (carboxylate derived from aspartate and glutamate) are known to have strong affinity with metal ions and to act as bridging ligands. The hydroxyl groups in serine, threonine, and tyrosine also possess metal-binding capability. These side chains of amino acids preferentially bind to metal ions such as Fe3+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ (23Lippard S.J. Berg J.M. Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1994: 43-46Google Scholar). The binding of these groups to Cu2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+ is unlikely. The competitive iron binding assay supports that the observed iron binding is derived from the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the hydrophilic C-terminal region in Mms6 is considered to initiate crystal nucleation in magnetite formation. It has been reported that a small acidic protein called statherin possesses dense negative charges in the N-terminal region that are responsible for the mineral-adsorbing ability, inhibiting crystal growth (24Raj P.A. Johnsson M. Levine M.J. Nancollas G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5968-5976Google Scholar). Although the interaction between organic molecules and solid phases is dependent upon the mineral (34Brown S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8651-8655Google Scholar), the observed iron-binding ability of Mms6 is also thought to inhibit iron mineralization, controlling morphology. However, a control mechanism of morphology is still unknown. In magnetic bacteria, the origin of BMP membrane vesicles has been suggested to arise through invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane (4Gorby Y.A. Beveridge T.J. Blakemore R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 834-841Google Scholar,7Okamura Y. Takeyama H. Matsunaga T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48183-48188Google Scholar). The biological compartmentalization through the formation of enclosed vesicles enables the chemical process of magnetite formation to be optimized and regulated. On the basis of the high resolution transmission electron microscopy and Mössbauer spectroscopy results, mineral transformation through BMP synthesis was hypothesized (35Frankel R.B. Papaefthymiou G.C. Blakemore R.B. O'Brien W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 147-159Google Scholar). The first step involves the accumulation of iron, followed by the precipitation of hydrated iron oxide and, finally, phase transformation of amorphous iron to magnetite during the nucleation stage and surface-controlled growth similar to the formation of magnetoferritin cores (36Meldrum F.C. Heywood B.R. Mann S. Science. 1992; 257: 522-523Google Scholar). Magnetite films have been synthesized using –OH groups of arrayed lipid layers as molecular templates for crystal synthesis by controlling gas-phase oxygen concentrations at room temperature (37Abe M. Ishihara T. Kitamoto Y. J. Appl. Physiol. 1999; 85: 5705-5707Google Scholar). The densely arrayed –OH groups derived from carboxylate adsorb iron ions and stimulate magnetite growth. Similarly, magnetite has been synthesized in iron solutions by adding recombinant Mms6. The observed precipitate color change suggests the phase transformation of iron oxides, Fe(OH)2 and γ-FeOOH, through magnetite. Significant shape similarity was observed between BMP and the crystals obtained from in vitro mineralization using Mms6. The –OH-rich C-terminal parts of the proteins tightly bound to BMPs might act as templates for magnetite crystal formation and direct the shape of magnetite crystals formed. In this study, the existence of proteins tightly associated with BMP crystals and their iron-binding ability have been shown. Mms6 provides nucleation sites for precipitation of iron oxide in the BMP vesicle. We thank S. Kamiya (Tokyo Denkikagaku Kogyo Akita Laboratory Corp.) and S.

In addition, it also produces a number of long chain and complex alcohols including isoamyl alcohol, isobutanol, active amyl alcohol, 2-phenylethanol, and tryptophol (1Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Google Scholar). These are all important flavor and aroma compounds in yeast-fermented products and have interesting organoleptic properties in their own right, many of which are both concentration- and context-dependent. These long chain and complex alcohols are the end products of amino acid catabolism. In this respect the pathways used by S. cerevisiae are very different from those in other eukaryotes that have been well understood for many years (2Bender D.A. Amino Acid Metabolism. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). We have sought to discover the genes and enzymes used by S. cerevisiae in the catabolism of leucine to isoamyl alcohol (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar), valine to isobutanol (4Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Google Scholar), and isoleucine to active amyl alcohol (5Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Dickinson J.A. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10937-10942Google Scholar). In all cases, the general sequence of biochemical reactions is similar, but the details for the formation of the individual alcohols are surprisingly different. The branched-chain amino acids are first deaminated to the corresponding α-ketoacids (α-ketoisocaproic acid from leucine, α-ketoisovaleric acid from valine, and α-keto-β-methylvaleric acid from isoleucine). There are significant differences in the way each α-ketoacid is subsequently decarboxylated. In the leucine degradation pathway the major decarboxylase is encoded by YDL080c. Consequently, we refer to this open reading frame as KID1 for ketoisocaproate decarboxylase 1 (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar). In valine degradation any one of the three isozymes of pyruvate decarboxylase encoded by PDC1, PDC5, andPDC6 will decarboxylate α-ketoisovalerate (4Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Google Scholar), and in isoleucine catabolism any one of the family of decarboxylases encoded by PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, YDL080c, or YDR380w is sufficient for the conversion of isoleucine to active amyl alcohol (5Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Dickinson J.A. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10937-10942Google Scholar). There are three important questions that remain unanswered. First, our earlier work had shown that the YDL080c-encoded decarboxylase was the major route of decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproate but that there was at least one other unidentified decarboxylase involved in leucine catabolism. This enzyme should be identified, and its metabolic contribution should be quantified. Second, other than the fact that tryptophan is the precursor of tryptophol, and phenylalanine is the precursor of 2-phenylethanol (1Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Google Scholar), little else is known about the genes and enzyme-catalyzed steps involved in the catabolism of these two aromatic amino acids in S. cerevisiae except that Ydr380wp has been suggested as a potential indolepyruvate decarboxylase (the enzyme that would be required for the conversion of indolepyruvate to indole acetaldehyde if tryptophan is catabolized in an analogous way to the branched-chain amino acids) (6Iraqui I. Vissers S. Andre B. Urrestarazu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3360-3371Google Scholar). Third, the final stage of long chain and complex alcohol formation has always been assumed to be an alcohol dehydrogenase-catalyzed step (1Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Google Scholar), but this has never been rigorously examined. Because yeast has 20 genes that could potentially encode this activity, seven putative aryl alcohol dehydrogenase genes (7Delneri D. Gardner D.C.J. Oliver S.G. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1591-1600Google Scholar, 8Delneri D. Gardner D.C.J. Bruschi C.V. Oliver S.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1681-1689Google Scholar) and 13 other alcohol dehydrogenase genes, ADH1,ADH2, ADH3, ADH4, ADH5,SFA1, BDH1, putative BDH2 (YAL061w),SOR1, putative SOR2 (YDL246c), XDH1, the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase CDH1 (YCR105w), and the recently proposed ADH6 (YMR318c) (9Larroy C. Fernández M.R. González E. Parés X. Biosca J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 361: 163-172Google Scholar), it is also necessary to discover which of these gene products are required for long chain and complex alcohol formation. This paper addresses all three questions. The strains used are shown in Table I. IWD72 is the wild-type strain that we have used for all studies of amino acid catabolism. Strain YPH499 is the wild-type parent of strain AAD7x. Standard genetic techniques were used in all cases (11Sherman F. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 189-199Google Scholar, 12Mortimer R.K. Hawthorn D.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 221-233Google Scholar). Strain 59.2.1 was produced by crossing strain Y04623 (MAT a his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 adh4::kanMX4 from EUROSCARF) with strain 58.3.4 (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1Δ63 his3Δ200 leu2Δ1). Strain 58.3.4 had been produced in an earlier cross between IWD72 and YPH499. Strain 60.3.3 was produced by mating strain 900–17-101a to strain 59.2.1 and sporulation of the resultant diploid. Strain 61.1.1 was produced by sporulating strain Y26236 (MATa/MATα his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/LYS2 MET15/met15Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0 adh1::kanMX4/ADH1 from EUROSCARF) and then dissection of the ascospores. Strain ESH380w was produced by a cross between strain Y14216 (MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 ydr380w::kanMX4 from EUROSCARF) and YSH5.127.17C. In all cases haploid progeny carrying a single gene disrupted with the kanMX4 cassette were identified by their ability to grow in the presence of G418 (Geneticin) at 200 μg/ml. Strain 62.3.17 was produced by crossing strain 60.3.3 and strain Y13284(MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 adh5::kanMX4 from EUROSCARF). Strain 66.1.3 was produced by crossing strain 60.3.3 and strain 63.2.1 (MATα his3Δ1 sfa1::kanMX4), the latter having been produced earlier by crossing IWD72 and Y03866. In progeny containing two alleles that were both disrupted with kanMX4, the presence of the adh4::kanMX4 andadh5::kanMX4 alleles or theadh4::kanMX4 andsfa1::kanMX4 alleles were confirmed by diagnostic polymerase chain reactions using specific primers that yielded products that were unique to each disruption allele.Table IYeast strains usedStrainGenotypeSource or reference51.1.3MATα ura3 ydl080c∷kanMX4(5Dickinson J.R.

Open table in a new tab Starter cultures were grown in a medium comprising 1% yeast extract, 2% Bactopeptone (Difco), and 2% carbon source. For studies of amino acid catabolism cells were grown in minimal medium containing (per liter) 1.67 g of yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 20 g of a single l-amino acid, and either 20 ml of ethanol or 20 g of glucose for the carbon source. Experiments involving13C labeling used [2-13C]phenylalanine (99 atom %) or [U-13C11-U-15N2]tryptophan (98 atom % 13C, 96–99 atom % 15N, 95% pure). Both labeled amino acids were obtained from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Auxotrophic requirements were supplied as required at 20 μg/ml. Liquid cultures were grown in conical flasks filled to 40% nominal capacity in a gyrorotatary shaker. Agar (2%) was used to solidify media. All cell cultures were at 30 °C. 13C NMR spectra were recorded, and signals were identified exactly as described previously (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar). Chemical shifts (δ, ppm) are reported relative to external tetramethylsilane in C2HCl3; addition of sodium trimethylsilylpropanesulfonate gave a methyl signal at −2.6 ppm under the conditions used here. The concentrations of the various alcohol end products of yeast amino acid catabolism were determined in culture filtrates using GC-MS as described before (5Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Dickinson J.A. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10937-10942Google Scholar). Standard solutions gave linear calibrations over the range from 0 to 1000 μg/ml. Strain 56.9.2 (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c ydr380w) was precultured in yeast extract-peptone-ethanol medium for 48 h when its A 600 nm had reached 8.0. An aliquot (1 ml) of this culture was inoculated into ethanol minimal medium in which leucine (2%) (w/v) was the sole source of nitrogen, and the cells were then cultured for 407 h by which time the A 600 nm was 12.2, corresponding to stationary phase for this strain in this medium. The concentration of isoamyl alcohol remained zero throughout the experiment. When strain JRD815–1.2 (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c) was cultured in the same medium for a similar time the concentration of isoamyl alcohol fell to ∼6% of that produced by its parent YSH5.127.-17C (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6) (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar). Thus, the ydl080c mutation had caused a 94% reduction in isoamyl alcohol levels (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar). This indicates that the YDL080c gene product is responsible for 94% of the decarboxylation of α-ketoisocaproic acid and that YDR380wp is the minor decarboxylase being responsible for only 6% of the flux in leucine degradation. Fig.1 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of wild-type strain IWD72 that had been cultured for 24 h in a minimal medium in which glucose was the carbon source and [2-13C]phenylalanine was the sole nitrogen source. The largest signal was C-2 of phenylalanine (the13C-labeled substrate). A number of resonances were observed because of natural abundance in the phenylalanine substrate: C-1 (at 174 ppm appearing as a doublet J = 54 Hz because of the adjacent labeled C-2), C-1 of the phenyl ring (135.1 ppm), C-2, C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 of the phenyl ring (129.3 ppm, 129.1 ppm, 128.6 ppm, 127.6 ppm and 126.4 ppm), and C-3 (at 36.4 ppm appearing as a doublet J = 34 Hz because of the adjacent labeled C-2). There were no natural abundance signals because of glucose indicating that it had all been consumed, but the resonances at 57.5 ppm and 16.8 ppm were because of C-1 and C-2 (respectively) of ethanol, which had been produced from the glucose. Another resonance that was observed because of natural abundance was C-1 of the phenyl ring of 2-phenylethanol at 139.1 ppm, which, along with the large resonance at 62.6 ppm, because of C-1 of 2-phenylethanol, and the smaller doublet at 37.8 ppm (J = 37 Hz), the C-2 of 2-phenyl ethanol, indicates that large quantities of this compound were produced from the [2-13C]phenylalanine substrate. Other important resonances identified were C-2 of 3-phenylpyruvate (204.2 ppm) and C-2 of 3-phenyllactate (73.4 ppm). A very small resonance at 214.7 ppm and a larger one at 64.1 ppm remain unidentified. The former is very likely a ketone. The latter is characteristic of a CH2 group adjacent to oxygen in an ester. Likely candidates were thought to include ethyl acetate, the ethyl ester of phenylalanine, and 2-phenylethyl acetate, but this was found not to be the case. The metabolites identified and the positions that were labeled with13C indicate that in yeast the pathway of phenylalanine catabolism is as shown in Fig. 2 in which phenylalanine is first deaminated to 3-phenylpyruvate. The 3-phenylpyruvate is then decarboxylated to 2-phenylacetaldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to 2-phenylethanol. The presence of13C label in C-2 of 3-phenyllactate can be explained by the reduction of 3-phenylpyruvate to 3-phenyllactate in an analogous fashion to the conversion of α-ketoisocaproate to α-hydroxyisocaproate and α-ketoisovalerate to α-hydroxyisovalerate, which were observed during the catabolism of leucine and valine (respectively) (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar, 4Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Google Scholar). To confirm the metabolic pathway of phenylalanine catabolism indicated by the13C NMR study and to ascertain which of the α-ketoacid decarboxylases are involved, a number of mutants were analyzed for their ability to grow and produce 2-phenylethanol in minimal medium in which phenylalanine was the sole nitrogen source. All of the strains were capable of using phenylalanine as the sole source of nitrogen (Fig. 3), and all had reached stationary phase by 100 h. Strain 53.1.4 (lpd1) grew conspicuously less well than all of the other strains. As noted previously, strains carrying lpd1 mutations have reduced energy production and, consequently, reduced growth on glucose minimal media compared with the wild-type (4Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Google Scholar, 15Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 103-107Google Scholar). Because the various strains grew to different extents, comparisons of the amount of 2-phenylethanol produced are better on a per cell basis rather than on the basis of absolute concentration in the growth medium. TableII shows that a significant reduction in 2-phenylethanol occurred in the pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydr380wstrain (ESH380w). The pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutant (YSH5.127.17C) and the ydr380w single mutant (55.2.1) did not show similar reductions in the amount of 2-phenylethanol synthesized. This indicates that the decarboxylation of 3-phenylpyruvate can proceed if any one of the four genes,PDC1, PDC5, PDC6, or YDR380w, is functional. A mutation in YDL080c either singly or in combination with any of the other mutations did not result in a lowering of 2-phenylethanol levels indicating that this open reading frame has no role in the decarboxylation of 3-phenylpyruvate. The lpd1mutant 53.1.4 that is defective in lipoamide dehydrogenase produced wild-type levels of 2-phenylethanol. Lipoamide dehydrogenase is an essential component of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and glycine decarboxylase (13Lanterman M.M. Dickinson J.R. Danner D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 1643-1648Google Scholar, 14Repetto B. Tzagoloff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3931-3939Google Scholar, 15Dickinson J.R. Roy D.J. Dawes I.W. Mol.

Hence, because strain 53.1.4 lacks branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, it can be concluded that this activity is not involved in the formation of 2-phenylethanol from phenylalanine.Table IIThe amount of 2-phenylethanol produced by various yeast strains growing in a minimal medium with phenylalanine as sole source of nitrogenStrainCarbon sourceRelevant genotype2-Phenylethanol2-Phenylethanolμg/mlμg/106cells51.1.3Ethanolydl080c194215.355.2.1Ethanolydr380w179617.957.2.13Ethanolydl080c ydr380w185619.6YSH5.127.17CEthanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6160914.5JRD815–1.2Ethanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c146011.7ESH380wEthanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydr380w100.256.9.2Ethanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c ydr380w90.153.1.4Glucoselpd138017.3IWD72EthanolWild-type331521.3IWD72GlucoseWild-type341621.9All pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutants cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (2%) as carbon source.

A lpd1 mutant cannot use ethanol; this strain had glucose (2%) as carbon source. 2-Phenylethanol was determined by GC-MS when each strain had reached stationary phase. The values are the means of two separate experiments. Differences between samples were <5%. Fig.4 shows the 13C NMR spectrum of a culture supernatant of wild-type strain IWD72 that had been cultured for 24 h in a minimal medium in which glucose was the carbon source and [U-13C11-U-15N2]tryptophan was the sole nitrogen source. The two 15N atoms showed negligible coupling to 13C atoms, and the NMR spectrum was effectively the same as if the tryptophan was labeled only with13C atoms. All of the C atoms of tryptophan were observed: C-1 (at 174.5 ppm appearing as a doublet J = 54 Hz), C-7′ of the indole ring (a triplet at 136 ppm), the C-6′, C-5′, C-4′, C-3α′, C-2α′, C-3′, and C-2′ atoms in the indole ring (multiplets at 126.6, 125.2, 122.0, 119.4, 118.4, 112.0, and 107.5 ppm), C-2 (a double doublet at 55.2 ppm), and C-3 (a double doublet at 26.4 ppm). As in the phenylalanine experiment, there were no natural abundance signals because of glucose indicating that it had all been consumed, but the resonances at 57.5 and 16.8 ppm (C-1 and C-2, respectively, of ethanol, produced from the glucose) were evident. Also evident were the C-1 (a doublet J = 37 Hz at 61.8 ppm) and C-2 (a double doublet at 27.3 ppm) of tryptophol, which had been produced from the tryptophan. The small resonance at 22.5 ppm could not be identified. The most likely candidate was thought to be the ethyl ester of tryptophan. S. cerevisiae forms a wide variety of esters, the quantities formed being largely determined by the concentrations of acids and alcohols present (17Calderbank J. Hammond J.R.M. J. Am. Soc. Brew. Chem. 1994; 52: 84-90Google Scholar). With the high concentrations of tryptophan and ethanol observed in this experiment, the formation of tryptophan ethyl ester would not have been a surprise. However, examination of the spectrum of the bona fide compound showed that it was not tryptophan ethyl ester. The resonance at 62.6 ppm is attributed to C-1 of 2-phenylethanol and is a singlet indicating that it was observed because of natural abundance and thus was not derived directly from tryptophan. The significance of this is further considered below. From the metabolites identified it is clear that tryptophan catabolism to tryptophol must proceed as shown in Fig.5. The fact that no signals were observed because of 3-indolepyruvate indicates that the pool size of this compound must be extremely low, and/or its subsequent decarboxylation is very rapid. This is consistent with the fact that no 3-indolelactate was observed although the absence of this compound may be because there is no enzyme in yeast that is capable of reducing 3-indolepyruvate to 3-indolelactate. The same set of mutants used to study phenylalanine catabolism were also analyzed for their ability to grow and produce tryptophol in minimal medium in which tryptophan was the sole nitrogen source. All of the strains were capable of using tryptophan as the sole source of nitrogen (Fig. 6), and all except ESH380w had reached stationary phase by 144 h. Strain ESH380w (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydr380w) had a very prolonged deceleration phase and did not reach stationary phase until 550 h. Upon inspecting the final cell density, it can be seen that there were two groups of strains. The majority, including the wild-type, reachedA 600 nm in the range from 6 to 7, whereas four strains (ESH380w, 55.2.1, 57.2.13, and 53.1.4) only reached half that density. As before, to allow for the fact that the various strains grew to different extents, comparisons of the amount of tryptophol produced are better made on a per cell basis rather than simply on the concentration in the growth medium. TableIII shows that most of the strains produced roughly similar amounts of tryptophol to the wild-type, but strains ESH380w (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydr380w) and 56.9.2 (pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c ydr380w) did not produce this compound. Because the pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 mutant YSH5.127.17C and the ydr380w single mutant 55.2.1 did not produce lowered levels of tryptophol, and ydl080c mutations (singly or in combination with other mutations) did not result in a lowering of tryptophol levels, it is apparent that tryptophan can be catabolized to tryptophol if any one of the four genes, PDC1,PDC5, PDC6, or YDR380w, is functional and that, as with phenylalanine catabolism in this yeast, YDL080c has no role.Table IIIThe amount of tryptophol and 2-phenylethanol produced by various yeast strains growing in a minimal medium with tryptophan as sole source of nitrogenStrainCarbon sourceRelevant genotypeTryptopholTryptophol2-Phenylethanol2-Phenylethanolμg/mlμg/106cellsμg/mlμg/106 cells51.1.3Ethanolydl080c1642.71051.755.2.1Ethanolydr380w1103.0571.657.2.13Ethanolydl080c ydr380w1493.61072.5YSH5.127.17CEthanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc63764.92052.7JRD815–1.2Ethanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c2893.91692.3ESH380wEthanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydr380w00.020.156.9.2Ethanolpdc1 pdc5 pdc6 ydl080c ydr380w10.010.053.1.4Glucoselpd1591.6441.2IWD72EthanolWild-type4787.11592.4IWD72GlucoseWild-type3095.1991.7All pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutants cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (2%) as carbon source.

Open table in a new tab All pdc1 pdc5 pdc6 triple mutants cannot utilize glucose; these had ethanol (2%) as carbon source. A lpd1 mutant cannot use ethanol; this strain had glucose (2%) as carbon source. Tryptophol and 2-phenylethanol were determined by GC-MS when each strain had reached stationary phase. The values are the means of two separate experiments. Differences between samples were <4%. Tryptophol levels were also reduced in the lpd1 mutant 53.1.4. This could be interpreted to mean that lipoamide dehydrogenase is required for tryptophan catabolism to tryptophol and that there is an alternative metabolic route involving one or more of branched-chain α-ketoacid dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, or glycine decarboxylase. However, we do not believe this to be the case for three reasons. First, the NMR and GC-MS analyses of the wild-type strain provide no evidence of alternative intermediates or end products. Second, the lpd1 mutant does not accumulate any intermediates that could be considered to be derived from tryptophan. Third, the tryptophol level produced by strain 53.1.4 is not reduced as drastically as in strains ESH380w and 56.9.2. On a per cell basis it is still 31% of the level produced by the wild-type in the same (glucose minimal) medium. We suspect that the reduced tryptophol formation in strain 53.1.4 is an indirect consequence of both its impaired energy metabolism and the fact that the absence of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketogluratarate dehydrogenase activities will result in shortages of α-ketogluratarate, which is required in the initial deamination of tryptophan. The lpd1 mutant uniquely did not consume all of the tryptophan by the end of the experiment. The NMR analysis of the catabolism of 13C-labeled tryptophan indicated the presence of unlabeled 2-phenylethanol. The results in Table III that were obtained using GC-MS confirm the presence of 2-phenylethanol at concentrations that were between one-third and one-half of the concentrations of tryptophol. The levels of 2-phenylethanol produced by cells grown on tryptophan as the sole nitrogen source were about one-tenth of the levels produced when the cells were grown on phenylalanine as the sole nitrogen source. This indicates wasteful catabolism of phenylalanine when yeast is growing on tryptophan as the sole nitrogen source. S. cerevisiae has 20 enzymes that potentially could be involved in the formation of long chain and complex alcohols. This includes the putative aryl alcohol dehydrogenases encoded by the seven-member family of AADgenes, all of which are of unknown function (7Delneri D. Gardner D.C.J. Oliver S.G. Genetics. 1999; 153: 1591-1600Google Scholar, 8Delneri D. Gardner D.C.J. Bruschi C.V. Oliver S.G. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1681-1689Google Scholar), and 13 other alcohol dehydrogenases. Seven of these can be eliminated after a consideration of their properties. For example, BDH1 (YAL060w) has been shown recently (18González E. Fernádez M.R. Larroy C. Solà L. Pericàs M.A. Parés X. Biosca J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35876-35885Google Scholar) to be involved in the formation of 2,3-butanediol. On the basis of similarity it is safe to assume that YAL061W can be called BDH2 and that it has a similar activity.SOR1 (YJR159W), SOR2 (YDL246C), andXDH1 (YLR070C) encode sugar alcohol dehydrogenases (19Sarthy A.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 135-138Google Scholar), which are not the type of enzyme activities sought in this investigation. CDH1 (YCR105W) and ADH6 (YMR318C) encode NADPH-dependent enzymes (9Larroy C. Fernández M.R. González E. Parés X. Biosca J.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 361: 163-172Google Scholar) and thus are also unlikely to be the type of enzyme activities involved here. This leaves six other alcohol dehydrogenases, of which perhaps the first four (Adh1p-Adh4p) are the best known. Adh1p is the main cytosolic enzyme involved in the formation of ethanol during glycolysis. Adh2p, which is also cytosolic, is the glucose-repressed enzyme that is needed for growth on ethanol. Adh3p is mitochondrial, it is induced on glucose, and its role is not really understood. Recent work from Pronk and co-workers (21Bakker B. Bro C. Kotter P. Luttik M.A.H. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4730-4737Google Scholar) suggest it is involved in a redox shuttle. Adh4p is present at only very low levels in most laboratory strains, but is plentiful in brewing strains (22Dickinson J.R. Dickinson J.R. Schweizer M. The Metabolism and Molecular Physiology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Taylor and Francis, London, United Kingdom1999: 23-55Google Scholar). Adh5p was discovered by genome sequencing, and its role is unexplained. Sfa1p is part of a bifunctional enzyme that has both glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase activity (the gene name comes fromsensitive to formaldehyde, which is the phenotype of mutants affected in this gene); it is also described as being capable of catalyzing the breakdown of long chain alcohols (23Wehner E.P. Rao E. Brendel M. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 351-358Google Scholar). Hence, each of Adh1p-Adhp5 and Sfa1p has at least one feature suggesting that it could be responsible for the synthesis of long chain alcohols. For example, Adh1p, Adh2p, and Adh3p all require zinc, and brewers have known for years that the concentration of zinc in the wort affects the concentrations of long chain alcohols that are formed. Alternatively, Adh3p and Adh4p appear to be good candidates as no certain role has yet been ascribed to them. Finally, because it has been shown that Sfa1p can degrade long chain alcohols in vitro, perhaps its true role in vivo is the formation of these compounds. To determine which alcohol dehydrogenase is/are required for the formation of fusel alcohols we used a strain mutated in all seven of its AAD genes and constructed other strains containing all possible combinations of single and multiple mutations affecting the six alcohol dehydrogenases. These strains were then grown in glucose minimal medium containing a single amino acid as the sole nitrogen source and analyzed for the ability to form the alcohol end product corresponding to the amino acid supplied. TableIV shows the amount of isoamyl alcohol produced when a selection of these strains were grown on leucine as the sole nitrogen source. All of the strains produced isoamyl alcohol. Equivalent results were obtained using other combinations of mutations and different single amino acid nitrogen sources. It appears that the AAD genes have no role in long chain or complex alcohol formation. Using both conventional crosses and by trying to transform strains carrying five alcohol dehydrogenase mutations, it proved impossible to construct a haploid that had mutations in all six alcohol dehydrogenase genes. From this we conclude that as long as yeast has one enzyme out of Adh1p-Adh5p or Sfa1p that is functional, it is viable and able to form long chain and complex alcohols.Table IVThe amount of isoamyl alcohol produced by various yeast strains growing in glucose minimal medium with leucine as sole source of nitrogenStrainRelevant genotypeIsoamyl alcoholIsoamyl alcoholμg/mlμg/106cells61.1.1adh11624.9Y00891adh23846.0Y06217adh33086.459.2.1adh42469.4Y03284adh54516.8301.10aadh1 adh2876.7900–17-101aadh1 adh2 adh31012.360.3.3adh1 adh2 adh3 adh45006.162.3.17adh1 adh2 adh3 adh4 adh54919.0Y03866sfa15347.766.1.3adh1 adh2 adh3 adh4 sfa14797.0AAD7xaad3 aad4 aad6 aad10 aad14 aad15 aad163085.8IWD72Wild-type7165.4Isoamyl alcohol was determined by GC-MS when each strain had reached stationary phase. The values are the means of two separate experiments. Differences between samples were <5%. Open table in a new tab Isoamyl alcohol was determined by GC-MS when each strain had reached stationary phase. The values are the means of two separate experiments. Differences between samples were <5%. Our previous study of leucine catabolism had identified Ydl080cp as the major decarboxylase, because mutation of this open reading frame alone led to an almost total (94%) abolition of the formation of isoamyl alcohol (3Dickinson J.R. Lanterman M.M. Danner D.J. Pearson B.M. Sanz P. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26871-26878Google Scholar). The current study has identified Ydr380wp as the minor decarboxylase accounting for only 6% of the flux. When both YDL080c and YDR380w are mutated a haploid strain of S. cerevisiae growing in minimal medium with leucine as the sole nitrogen source makes no isoamyl alcohol indicating that no other pathway exists for the synthesis of this compound. This study has shown that in S. cerevisiae the catabolism of phenylalanine to 2-phenylethanol and of tryptophan to tryptophol are both accomplished in a similar way corresponding to what has been called the Ehrlich pathway (1Webb A.D. Ingraham J.L. Adv. Appl. Microbiol. 1963; 5: 317-353Google Scholar). Based on piecemeal evidence derived from studies in different yeast species, it is often asserted (24Large P.J. Yeast. 1986; 2: 1-34Google Scholar) that yeasts catabolize phenylalanine via trans-cinnamate to benzoate and protocatechuate and that the benzene ring is subsequently opened to give maleylacetate, which is then supposedly reduced to 3-ketoadipate. The same authors state that tryptophan degradation involves ring opening by a dioxygenase to yieldN-formyl-l-kynurenine. Deformylation is said to yield l-kynurenine, which then has an alanine moiety removed to produce anthranilate. The pathway subsequently envisages 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate, catechol, cis,cis-muconate, and finally 3-ketoadipate. Evidence for both pathways comes mainly fromTrichosporon cutaneum (25Sparnins V.L. Burbee D.G. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 138: 425-430Google Scholar, 26Anderson J.J. Dagley S. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 291-297Google Scholar). Our NMR study showed no evidence of any of the intermediates of either of these pathways. Furthermore, 3-ketoadipate, the supposed end product of both phenylalanine and tryptophan catabolism, would give a clear signal in the region 200–210 ppm because of the C=O group. There was no such resonance in either spectrum. The only conclusion possible is that inS. cerevisiae phenylalanine and tryptophan are catabolized according to the Ehrlich pathway. In both phenylalanine and tryptophan catabolism the decarboxylation step is carried out by any one of the gene products of PDC1,PDC5, PDC6, or YDR380w. YDL080c has no part in the catabolism of either of these amino acids. Thus, it is apparent that in each of the amino acid catabolic pathways that we have studied, the crucial decarboxylation step is accomplished in subtly different ways. In leucine catabolism Ydl080cp is the major decarboxylase, and Ydr380wp is the minor decarboxylase. In valine catabolism any one of the pyruvate decarboxylase isozymes (Pdc1p, Pdc5p, or Pdc6p) can perform the decarboxylation of α-ketoisovaleric acid (4Dickinson J.R. Harrison S.J. Hewlins M.J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25751-25756Google Scholar), whereas in isoleucine catabolism any one of the five-membered family of decarboxylases (Pdc1p, Pdc5p, Pdc6p, Ydl080cp, or Ydr380wp) is sufficient. In complete contrast, for catabolism of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine and tryptophan Ydl080c is irrelevant; it is not needed for these two pathways. This study showed that any one of six alcohol dehydrogenases (encoded by ADH1, ADH2, ADH3, ADH4,ADH5, or SFA1) is sufficient for the final stage of long chain or complex alcohol formation in S. cerevisiae. Of course, this does not mean that every 5-fold alcohol dehydrogenase mutant will proliferate and produce fusel alcohols under all conditions. For example, an adh1 adh3 adh4 adh5 sfa1 mutant will not grow in high concentrations of glucose, because the remaining alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh2p) is repressed by glucose. More than 40 years ago, well before the genome and proteome of this yeast were fully characterized, it had been concluded that the final step in fusel alcohol formation was catalyzed by either of the enzymes that are now known as Adh1p or Adh2p (27SentheShanmuganathan S. Biochem. J. 1960; 77: 619-625Google Scholar). This correct but incomplete conclusion was made without a knowledge of all of the alcohol dehydrogenases that yeast has. The functions of the seven AAD genes remain unknown. In S. cerevisiae catabolism of the three branched-chain amino acids (leucine, valine, and isoleucine) and the two aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tryptophan) proceeds essentially as Ehrlich proposed nearly 100 years ago (28Ehrlich F. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. 1907; 40: 1027-1047Google Scholar). However, it is much more complex than Ehrlich ever imagined, because yeast uses at least three aminotransferases, five decarboxylases, and six alcohol dehydrogenases. The precise combination of enzymes used at a particular time depends upon the amino acid, the carbon source, and the stage of growth of the culture. In our experience, the major specificity resides with the decarboxylases. It is the regulation of these decarboxylases that is the current focus of our interest."

Unraveling the structural mechanism for cross-talk between receptors in a dimeric complex must start with the identification of the presently unknown dimer interface. Two hypotheses have been proposed for GPCR dimerization: domain swapping and contact dimerization (17Gouldson P.R. Higgs C. Smith R.E. Dean M.K. Gkoutos G.V. Reynolds C.A. Neuropsychopharmacology. 2000; 23: S60-S77Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Gouldson P.R. Snell C.R. Bywater R.P. Higgs C. Reynolds C.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 1181-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), although recent experimental results seem inconsistent with domain swapping being the dominant form of dimerization (19Schulz A.

Bloodworth L.M. Wess J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7647-7658Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Synthetic peptides of TM6 block dimerization and activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (21Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the GXXXG motif in TM6 may be involved in dimerization of this receptor, although this motif is not highly conserved in other family A GPCRs. Synthetic peptides of TM6 and of TM7 also blocked dimerization of the D2 receptor (D2R) (12Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Although these findings were specific to these particular synthetic peptides, the data do not necessarily establish TM6 and/or TM7 as the dimer interface, as the peptide-receptor interactions might modulate the ability of the receptor to form dimers at a different interface. In addition, if the receptors form higher order oligomers, multiple interfaces must exist. Computational studies have proposed a number of different potential interfaces (22Gouldson P.R. Dean M.K.

Biopolymers (Peptide Science). 2002; 66: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), but these have not yet been experimentally verified. By using cysteine cross-linking, we have now explored the possibility that the D2R exists as a dimer or higher order oligomer in the plasma membrane. We show that the D2R is at least a homodimer, with the extracellular end of TM4 at a symmetrical dimer interface. Residues are numbered according to their positions in the human dopamine D2short receptor sequence. We also index residues relative to the most conserved residue in the TM in which it is located (32Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The most conserved residue is assigned the position index “50,” e.g. Trp-1604.50, and therefore Val-1594.49 and Val-1614.51. Mutations were generated as described previously (30Javitch J.A. Shi L.

Mutants are named as (wild-type residue)-(residue number)position index (mutant residue), where the residues are given in the single-letter code. The cDNA encoding the dopamine D2short receptor or the appropriate cysteine mutant was epitope-tagged at the amino terminus with the cleavable influenza-hemagglutinin signal sequence followed by the FLAG epitope (DYKDDDK) and inserted into the bicistronic expression vector pcin4 (30Javitch J.A.

Double stable cells were created by transfecting stable cells expressing SFD2-pcin4 with the SMD2-pcihyg construct and selecting with 250 μg/ml hygromycin. EM4 cells, an adherent clonal line of HEK 293 cells, were maintained as described (33Saunders C. Ferrer J.V. Shi L. Chen J. Merrill G. Lamb M.E. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Carvelli L. Javitch J.A. Galli A.

BioTechniques. 1998; 25: 240-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells or EM4 cells stably transfected with the appropriate D2R construct were washed and then reacted for 10 min at room temperature with the stated concentrations of copper sulfate and 1,10-phenanthroline (CuP) as described previously (35Hastrup H. Karlin A. Javitch J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Phenanthroline was used at a 4-fold molar excess over copper. After removal of the CuP solution, the cells were washed twice with 4 ml of PBS and reacted for 20 min at room temperature with 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) in PBS++ buffer (11 mmNa2HPO4, 154 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2) to block free sulfhydryl groups. The cells were scraped into PBS++/PI buffer (PBS++ supplemented with 2 μg/ml Pefabloc, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 mm NEM) and pelleted at 800 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended and incubated in 0.5% dodecyl maltoside (DM) for 60 min at 4 °C. The mixture was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Twenty μl of extract was mixed with an equal volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent. HEK 293 cells, stably transfected with SFD2 or SMD2 or both were reacted with CuP and solubilized in DM as above. To 0.3 ml of DM extracts was added 1.5 μl anti-FLAG M1 mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), and the mixture was incubated for 1 h on ice. Thirty μl of prewashed rec-protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added, and the mixture was incubated 1 h at 4 °C, washed four times in 1 ml of lysis buffer, and eluted at room temperature for 30 min in 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer without reducing agent. Samples were applied to 1.5-mm, 10-well 7.5% acrylamide gels prepared and run according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The bands were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), which was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). To detect FLAG-D2R, we typically incubated the blot with an anti-FLAG rabbit polyclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:10,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. For Myc-D2R we incubated with an anti-Myc rabbit polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:400 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were washed three times for 10 min in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit-antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), diluted 1:15,000 in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 10 min with TBS containing 0.1% Tween, and reacted with ECL-Plus reagent (AmershamBiosciences). Luminescence was detected and quantitated on a FluorChem 8000 (Alpha Innotech Corporation). Intact cells were harvested for binding and [3H]N-methylspiperone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) binding was performed as described previously (30Javitch J.A. Shi L. Simpson M.M. Chen J. Chiappa V.

EM4 cells stably expressing the D2R mutants were used for assay of cAMP accumulation as described previously (37Liapakis G. Ballesteros J.A. Papachristou S. Chan W.C. Chen X. Javitch J.A. J. Biol.

Our strategy to identify residues forming the dimer interface in the D2R was to use cysteine cross-linking. Thus, it was essential to develop a system that would allow non-cross-linked receptor to run as a monomer on non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In preliminary experiments using transient transfection of D2R, we found, consistent with previous reports (12Ng G.Y. O'Dowd B.F. Lee S.P. Chung H.T. Brann M.R. Seeman P. George S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 227: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), that a substantial amount of receptor migrated as dimer or higher-order oligomer (data not shown). Stably expressed D2R produced substantially less of higher-order species on SDS-PAGE. Moreover, we found that mutation to Ser of Cys-3716.61 and Cys-3736.63 in the third extracellular loop, between TM6 and TM7, which leaves only two extracellular cysteines (the highly conserved disulfide-bonded Cys-1073.25 and Cys-182E2) further decreased oligomeric SDS-resistant species (data not shown). The resulting background construct (C1183.36S/C3716.61S/C3736.63S) ran almost exclusively as a heterogeneously glycosylated monomer of ∼65 kDa on non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). (As shown below, this background construct, subsequently referred to as D2R, was fully functional and bound multiple ligands normally.) Thus, if the D2R is oligomeric, the oligomer dissociates in SDS. In addition, the D2R is not an obligatory disulfide-linked dimer in the plasma membrane, unlike some class C receptors (2Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 6Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol.

After solubilization with DM we detected no or only trace coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-D2R under these conditions (Fig. 1 C), although the FLAG-D2R was immunoprecipitated as expected (data not shown). Thus, if the D2R is oligomeric in the membrane, the oligomer does not survive DM solubilization. As a control before introducing engineered cysteines into FLAG-D2R for disulfide cross-linking experiments we reacted FLAG-D2R in intact cells with copper phenanthroline (CuP), an oxidizing reagent that promotes the formation of disulfide bonds directly between cysteines (25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 26Wu J. Kaback H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14498-14502Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Reaction with CuP produced a new band of ∼133 kDa (Fig. 1 A), approximately twice that of monomer. The fraction of total density that was present in the ∼133 kDa band was plotted against increasing CuP (Fig. 1, A and B), giving half-maximal cross-linking at 60 ± 10 μm CuP and maximal cross-linking of 80 ± 14% (n = 3). The cross-linked species size was consistent with it being a homodimer of D2R, but it was possible that it might represent D2R cross-linked to another protein of similar size. The partners in the cross-linked species were definitively identified by coimmunoprecipitation of Myc-D2R stably coexpressed with FLAG-D2R. After reaction with CuP, immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody produced an ∼133-kDa band that was recognized by anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 C). In contrast when FLAG-D2R and Myc-D2R were expressed separately and then cross-linked, precipitation with anti-FLAG antibody did not produce a ∼133-kDa species recognized by anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1 C), demonstrating the specificity of the antibodies. These results establish that the ∼133-kDa band is a D2R homodimer that is disulfide cross-linked via one of the remaining endogenous cysteines. Mutation of Cys-1684.58 in the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) to Ser (as well as to Ala or Phe, data not shown), but not mutation of Cys-561.54, Cys-1263.44, or Cys-3566.47, completely prevented CuP-induced cross-linking (Fig. 2 A), demonstrating that this Cys at the extracellular end of TM4 forms the disulfide cross-link at a symmetrical homodimer interface. To assess ligand binding effects on the dimerization state of the receptor, we treated cells expressing the background construct with the agonists, quinpirole or bromocriptine, or the antagonists, sulpiride or butaclamol. Neither acute nor 24-h treatment with these ligands significantly impacted cross-linking under conditions in which nearly all the receptor was cross-linked (Fig. 2 B). This suggests that the receptor is a constitutive dimer (or possibly a higher order oligomer) in the plasma membrane and that ligand interaction does not lead to dissociation of the dimer. To study the effects of cross-linking Cys-1684.58 on ligand binding, we oxidized with 1 mm/4 mm CuP to ensure that essentially all D2R was cross-linked (see Fig. 1). We observed no change in the K D or Bmax for the antagonist [3H]N-methylspiperone (Fig. 3 C), or in theK I for sulpiride or dopamine (Fig. 3, Aand B). We also assessed the effects of cross-linking Cys-1684.58 on dopamine-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by the D2R. In the absence of D2R, treatment with 1 mm/4 mm CuP significantly inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase through a direct effect on adenylyl cyclase (data not shown). This resulted in an apparent decrease in the potency and efficacy of dopamine in both the Cys-1684.58 and C1684.58S constructs after treatment with CuP (Fig. 3 D). Nonetheless, after treatment with CuP, dopamine was equally efficacious at inhibiting cyclase in a Cys-1684.58 construct that was highly cross-linked and in a C1684.58S construct that did not cross-link. We observed no dopamine-mediated inhibition of cAMP levels in untransfected EM4 cells. This argues that the dopamine-mediated inhibition of cyclase occurred only via the stably expressed D2R. Because cross-linking requires that only one of the two cysteines involved is modified initially by the reagent, and the derivatized cysteine then reacts by collision with the second unmodified cysteine, the rate of collision must be much faster than the rate of initial modification. This is consistent with the cysteines being very close initially. The very high fraction of receptor that can be cross-linked, the apparent specificity of the cross-linking, based on the appearance of a single homodimer band, and the lack of cross-linking of Cys-561.54, which based on the bovine rhodopsin structure has a similar lipid accessibility as Cys-1684.58, all argue for the proximity of the TM4 cysteines in the native state. Thus, it is likely that in the membrane, untreated with CuP, D2R exists as a homodimer but that this dimer does not survive detergent solubilization. Cross-linking does not impair the ability of dopamine to inhibit cyclase via the D2R (Fig. 3), demonstrating that the receptor can bind dopamine and activate Gi with a disulfide between Cys-1684.58 in each “subunit” of the dimer. Thus, significant movement of the dimer interface at the Cys-1684.58 position is not necessary for function. Moreover, ligand recognition was unaltered by cross-linking, and the extent of cross-linking was unaltered by treatment with agonists or antagonists, suggesting that the receptor is a constitutive dimer. These results are consistent with the recent findings of Mercieret al. (27Mercier J.F. Salahpour A. Angers S. Breit A. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44925-44931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Using quantitative bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), they showed that more than 82% of β2-adrenergic receptor in the plasma membrane exists as a constitutive dimer (or higher order oligomer) over a broad range of expression levels. They also failed to observe a change in BRET upon addition of ligand and suggested that the dimer does not form or dissociate upon activation. Bovine rhodopsin was crystallized in detergent as a non-physiological dimer in which the cytoplasmic face of one molecule is in the same plane as the extracellular face of the second molecule (28Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that the native oligomeric structure of rhodopsin is disrupted in detergent and is therefore not seen in the crystal structure. Indeed, our findings that the dopamine receptor is a dimer in the plasma membrane but cannot be immunoprecipitated from a DM extract argues that the D2 receptor native quaternary structure is not preserved in this detergent. Interestingly, squid rhodopsin in detergent forms two-dimensional crystals that show a TM4 dimer interface (29Davies A. Gowen B.E. Krebs A.M. Schertler G.F. Saibil H.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A). These results suggest that the TM4 dimer interface may be common to other GPCRs as well as the D2R. Using the substituted cysteine accessibility method in the D2R, we found that cysteines in TM4 substituted for the highly conserved Trp-1604.50 as well as for Phe-1644.54 and Leu-1714.61 were accessible to charged sulfhydryl reagents and that this reaction was protected by the antagonist sulpiride (30Javitch J.A. Shi L. Simpson M.M. Chen J. Chiappa V. Visiers I. Weinstein H. Ballesteros J.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12190-12199Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We originally inferred that these residues in TM4 faced the binding site crevice. Surprisingly, in the bovine rhodopsin structure, the aligned residues Trp-1614.50, Leu-1654.54, and Leu-1724.61 face outward and not into the binding site crevice (28Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (4971) Google Scholar). Our observations regarding the anomalous conservation and accessibility of this “back face” of TM4 suggested to us the possibility that this surface might be at the interface between two D2R subunits (31Ballesteros J.A. Shi L. Javitch J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Our finding that the site of cross-linking in D2R is Cys-1684.58 at the extracellular end of TM4 directly adjacent to these accessible residues (Fig. 4 B) is consistent with this hypothesis that TM4 forms a symmetrical dimer interface. We are currently extending these studies to include other residues in TM4 in an attempt to map the entire interface and to assess whether conformational changes occur at this interface in different functional states of the receptor. Given that cysteines substituted for Trp-1604.50, Phe-1644.54, and Leu-1714.61 were protected from reaction by sulpiride, we think it likely that such conformational changes do occur and may mediate cross-talk between receptor subunits.

https://openalex.org/W1985491687,"Cancer vaccines targeting 'self' antigens that are expressed at consistently high levels by tumor cells are potentially useful in immunotherapy, but immunological tolerance may block their function. Here, we describe a novel, naked DNA vaccine encoding an alphavirus replicon (self-replicating mRNA) and the self/tumor antigen tyrosinase-related protein-1. Unlike conventional DNA vaccines, this vaccine can break tolerance and provide immunity to melanoma. The vaccine mediates production of double-stranded RNA, as evidenced by the autophosphorylation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR). Double-stranded RNA is critical to vaccine function because both the immunogenicity and the anti-tumor activity of the vaccine are blocked in mice deficient for the RNase L enzyme, a key component of the 2',5'-linked oligoadenylate synthetase antiviral pathway involved in double-stranded RNA recognition. This study shows for the first time that alphaviral replicon-encoding DNA vaccines activate innate immune pathways known to drive antiviral immune responses, and points the way to strategies for improving the efficacy of immunization with naked DNA."

The physiological changes sperm undergo in the female reproductive tract that render sperm able to fertilize constitute the phenomenon of “sperm capacitation.” We have demonstrated that capacitation is associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins and that these events are regulated by an HCO 3−/cAMP-dependent pathway involving protein kinase A. Capacitation is also accompanied by hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane. Here we present evidence that, in addition to its role in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase, HCO 3− has a role in the regulation of plasma membrane potential in mouse sperm. Addition of HCO 3−but not Cl− induces a hyperpolarizing current in mouse sperm plasma membranes. This HCO 3−-dependent hyperpolarization was not observed when Na+ was replaced by the non-permeant cation choline+. Replacement of Na+ by choline+ also inhibited the capacitation-associated increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction. The lack of an increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation was overcome by the presence of cAMP agonists in the incubation medium. The lack of a hyperpolarizing HCO 3− current and the inhibition of the capacitation-dependent increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of Na+ suggest that a Na+/HCO 3− cotransporter is present in mouse sperm and is coupled to events regulating capacitation.

Knobil E. Neill J.D. The Physiology of Reproduction. 1. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 189-317Google Scholar). The molecular, biochemical, and physiological changes that occur in sperm while in the female tract are collectively referred to as capacitation. During capacitation, changes in membrane dynamics and properties, enzyme activities, and motility render spermatozoa responsive to stimuli that induce the acrosome reaction and prepare these cells for penetration of the egg vestments prior to fertilization. These changes are facilitated by the activation of sperm cell signaling cascades during residence of these cells in the female reproductive tract in vivo or in defined media in vitro. Molecular events implicated in the initiation of capacitation have been partially defined and include the removal of cholesterol by cholesterol acceptors such as bovine serum albumin (BSA)1 from the sperm plasma membrane, modifications in plasma membrane phospholipids, fluxes of HCO 3− and other intracellular ions, and increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins. These events are likely involved in the induction of hyperactivation and the acrosome reaction (for review see Visconti et al. (2Visconti P.E. Westbrook V.A. Chertihin O. Demarco I. Sleight S. Diekman A.B. J. Reprod. Immunol. 2002; 53: 133-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)). Mammalian sperm capacitation is also accompanied by the hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane (3Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Hyperpolarization is observed as an increase in the intracellular negative charges when compared with the extracellular environment. Although it is not clear how sperm plasma membrane potential is regulated during capacitation, it appears that membrane hyperpolarization may be partially because of an enhanced K+ permeability as a result of a decrease in inhibitory modulation of K+ channels (3Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, Muñoz-Garay et al. (4Muñoz-Garay C. De la Vega-Beltran J.L. Delgado R. Labarca P. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) demonstrated with patch clamp techniques that inward rectifying K+ channels are expressed in mouse spermatogenic cells and proposed that these channels may be responsible for the capacitation-associated membrane hyperpolarization. Interestingly, Ba2+ blocks these K+ channels with an IC50 similar to that shown to inhibit the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization and the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction (4Muñoz-Garay C. De la Vega-Beltran J.L. Delgado R. Labarca P. Felix R. Darszon A. Dev. Biol. 2001; 234: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The functional role of sperm plasma membrane hyperpolarization during capacitation is at present not well understood. However, one may speculate that because capacitation prepares the sperm for the acrosome reaction, capacitation-associated membrane hyperpolarization may regulate the ability of sperm to generate transient Ca2+ elevations during acrosome reaction by physiological agonists (e.g. zona pellucida of the egg or progesterone) (5Florman H.M. Arnoult C. Kazam I.G. Li C. O'Toole C.M. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 12-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is consistent with the presence of low voltage-activated (LVA) Ca2+ T channels in spermatogenic cells (6Lievano A. Santi C.M. Serrano C.J. Trevino C.L. Bellve A.R. Hernandez-Cruz A.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that capacitation is an HCO 3−-dependent process (8Lee M.A. Storey B.T. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 349-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 9Neill J.M.

However, little is known about the mechanisms of HCO 3−transport in sperm. The ability of 4,4′-diiodothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS), a well known inhibitor of anion transporters, to inhibit the actions of HCO 3− on various sperm functions suggests that sperm contain functional anion transporters (13Okamura N.

In the present work, we have investigated the role of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and HCO 3− in plasma membrane hyperpolarization of mouse sperm during capacitation. We have demonstrated that both BSA and HCO 3− in the incubation media are necessary for the capacitation-associated membrane hyperpolarization. In addition, we have shown that HCO 3− directly induced hyperpolarization of the mouse sperm plasma membrane. This HCO 3−-induced hyperpolarization is Na+-dependent, results in an increase in pHi, and is inhibited by DIDS. Altogether these data demonstrate the presence of a Na+/HCO 3− cotransporter in mouse sperm and suggest its involvement in the regulation of sperm plasma membrane hyperpolarization and additional events leading to the capacitation state. Chemicals were obtained from the following sources: dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2-cAMP), (R p)-cAMPS, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), cholesterol 3-sulfate (cholesterol SO 4−), 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (2-OH-p-β-CD), carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), valinomycin, nigericin, ouabain, H89, DIDS, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS), choline chloride (choline+Cl−), choline bicarbonate (choline+HCO 3−), trimethylamine hydrochloride, and water used to make Whitten's media (water for embryo transfer) were purchased from Sigma; the fluorescent dyes 3,3′-dipropylthiadicarbocyanine iodide (DiSC3-(5)), bis-(1,3-diethylthiobarbituric acid trimethine oxonol (DiSBAC2-(3)), and 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) were purchased from Molecular Probes. Procedures for preparing stock solutions varied according to solubility and the desired final concentrations. The following were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at the stock concentrations noted in parentheses and stored at −20 °C except when otherwise stated: cholesterol SO 4− (100 and 10 mm), H89 (10 mm), IBMX (200 mm made fresh the day of the experiment), DiSC3-(5), DiSBAC2-(3), BCECF-AM, and CCCP (all 1 mm), valinomycin (2 mm), ouabain (1, 5, and 10 mm), and DIDS and SITS (both 100 mm). (R p)-cAMPS (100 mm) and Bt2-cAMP (100 mm made fresh the day of the experiment) were prepared in stock solutions with Whitten's medium. 2-OH-p-β-CD was added directly to Whitten's medium for a final concentration of 1 mm. Solutions of 800 mm trimethylamine hydrochloride, choline+Cl−, choline+HCO 3−, and NaHCO3 were made the day of the experiment in deionized water and buffered with 50 mm HEPES. Nigericin was dissolved in ethanol to a stock concentration of 5 mm. In most experiments, cauda epididymal mouse sperm were collected from CD1 retired male breeders by placing minced cauda epididymis in a modified Krebs-Ringer medium (Whitten's/HEPES-buffered) (25Moore G.D. Ayabe T. Visconti P.E. Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Development. 1994; 120: 3313-3323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This medium, which does not support capacitation, was first prepared in the absence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and NaHCO3 and contains 1 mmpolyvinylpyrrolidone (average M r, 40,000). After 5 min, sperm in suspension were washed in 10 ml of the same medium by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min at room temperature (24 °C). Sperm were then resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml and diluted 10 times in the appropriate medium depending on the experiment performed. In experiments where capacitation was investigated, 5 mg/ml BSA and 24 mm NaHCO3 were added; to compensate for the addition of NaHCO3, 24 mm NaCl was added to the control medium. In all cases pH was maintained at 7.2. To study the role of Na+ in capacitation and in the regulation of the membrane potential, NaCl was replaced by choline+Cl− up to the concentration indicated in the respective experiment. Other Na+ salts present in Whitten's/HEPES were replaced with their respective K+salts, and the total K+ concentration was maintained at 5.9 mm. Because β-cyclodextrins are able to replace BSA as a cholesterol sink and capacitate mouse sperm (26Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol.

After incubation under different experimental conditions, the sperm were concentrated by centrifugation, washed in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, resuspended in sample buffer (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) without 2-mercaptoethanol, and boiled for 5 min. After centrifuging, the supernatants were saved, and 2-mercaptoethanol was added to a final concentration of 5%. The samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic transfer of proteins to Immobilon P (Bio-Rad) and immunodetection of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and hexokinase type 1 were carried out using anti-phosphotyrosine (αPY) monoclonal antibodies (Clone 4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and a polyclonal anti-hexokinase type 1 (α ΗΚ1) as described previously (28Kalab P. Visconti P. Leclerc P. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3810-3817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) and an ECL kit (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A number of fluorescent indicator dyes have been commonly used by several laboratories to evaluate membrane potential. DiSBAC2-(3) and DiSC3-(5) have been successfully used in mammalian sperm (3Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 29Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These fluorescent dyes are charged and distribute across cellular membranes in response to electrochemical gradients. As a result of binding to intracellular proteins, the dyes undergo quenching of the fluorescent emission and exhibit a slight shift in their spectrum (30Plasek J. Hrouda V. Eur. Biophys.

Because DiSBAC2-(3) is an anionic oxonol and DiSC3-(5) is a cationic carbocyanine dye, they distribute in opposite directions across the cell membrane at equivalent membrane potentials. Neither dye has toxic effects on sperm function at the concentrations used (<5 μm) (3Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). When constant concentrations of sperm and probe are used, these dyes provide reproducible estimates of plasma membrane potential. Both fluorescent dyes possess advantages and disadvantages in sperm. For the most part, we have used DiSC3-(5) due to its greater signal and the convenience of calibration using valinomycin. One problem with the use of DiSC3-(5) is that this cationic dye binds to mitochondria in their normal energized state; this can contribute up to 20–30% of the fluorescence signal (3Zeng Y. Clark E.N. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 171: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To alleviate this problem, recordings were initiated after dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential with 1 μm CCCP. Under these conditions, the plasma membrane potential of valinomycin-treated mouse sperm responds to the extracellular K+ concentration following the Nernst equation. In selected experiments, a set of parallel membrane potential determinations were carried out using DiSBAC2-(3), which is negatively charged, distributes across the membrane in the opposite direction, and does not bind to mitochondria; these experiments were performed as controls to the determinations performed with the cationic DiSC3-(5). DiSBAC2-(3) has the disadvantage that it forms an insoluble complex with valinomycin, thus complicating calibration of plasma membrane potential. Sperm were collected as described above and, after dilution in the appropriate medium, capacitated for different times. Eight min before the measurement, 1 μm DiSC3-(5) (final concentration) was added to the sperm suspension and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, and when used, 1 μm CCCP (final concentration) was added, and the sperm were incubated for 2 additional min. After this period, 1.5 ml of the suspension was transferred to a gently stirred cuvette at 37 °C, and the fluorescence (620/670 nm excitation/emission) was recorded continuously. After reaching a steady fluorescence (usually after 1–2 min), calibration was performed by adding 1 μm valinomycin and sequential additions of KCl (29Espinosa F. Darszon A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 372: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The initial suspension contains 5.9 mm KCl; additional KCl was added to the final concentrations of 8, 12, 20, and 36 mm KCl, corresponding to plasma membrane potentials of −80, −72, −61, −47, and −32 mV, respectively. These values were obtained using the Nernst equation, assuming an intracellular K+ concentration of 120 mm (31Babcock D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6380-6389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and considering that the membrane potential corresponds to the K+equilibrium in the presence of CCCP and valinomycin. The sperm membrane potential in each case was linearly interpolated using these data as plasma membrane potential versus arbitrary units of fluorescence (Fig. 1). The fluorescence emission of DiSC3-(5) depends on variables such as sperm number, dye concentration, sperm viability, fluorimeter cuvette dimensions, and the presence of compounds that interact with DiSC3-(5). The internal calibration of each single determination compensates for variables that influence the absolute fluorescence values. As mentioned before, in some cases membrane potential was measured using DiSBAC2-(3). In these cases, sperm were incubated as described above, except that 0.5 μm DiSBAC2-(3) was added 5 min before the fluorescence measurements, and fluorescence (535/560 nm excitation/emission wavelength pair) was recorded. For this purpose, the pH-sensitive dye BCECF was used (32Garcia M.A. Meizel S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Sperm (1 × 106) in Whitten's medium were incubated for 5 min in 4 μmBCECF-AM, the permeant non-fluorescent precursor of BCECF. Once within the cell, non-specific esterases hydrolyze the acetoxymethyl ester (AM), yielding the non-permeant fluorescent indicator. The low leakage rate of BCECF and the small intracellular volume result in the final intracellular concentration being much higher than the external incubation concentration. After incubation, cells were washed in fresh medium once (400 × g for 5 min), and 1.5 ml of this suspension was placed in a gentle-stirring cuvette for fluorescence measurements. The pH-dependent spectral shift exhibited by BCECF allows calibration of the pH response in terms of the ratio of fluorescence intensities measured at two different excitation wavelengths (510/450 nm, fixed emission at 540 nm). Calibration was performed by the null point determination as described by Babcock (31Babcock D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6380-6389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In those experiments in which the effect of the Na+concentration was assayed, the sperm were collected and washed in Na+-free medium (Whitten's/choline+). On the premise that only capacitated sperm will undergo exocytosis in response to zonae pellucidae, the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction in sperm was analyzed as end point of capacitation. Zona pellucidae were prepared from homogenized ovaries of virgin female 22-day-old outbred CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories) as described (33Ward C.R. Storey B.T. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14061-14067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and solubilized for all experiments by the procedures outlined previously (11Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The percentage of acrosome reaction was measured using Coomassie Blue G-250 as described (34Visconti P.E. Ning X. Fornes M.W. Alvarez J.G. Stein P. Connors S.A. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Briefly, sperm were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min followed by the addition of 5 zona pellucida equivalents/μl. After an additional 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of 2× fixative solution (10% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each tube. Following fixation, 10-μl aliquots of suspension were spread onto glass slides and air-dried. The slides were then stained with 0.22% Coomassie Blue G-250 in 50% methanol and 10% glacial acetic acid for 3–5 min, gently rinsed with deionized H2O, air-dried, and mounted with 50% (v/v) glycerol in phosphate-buffered saline. To calculate the percentage of acrosome reaction, at least 100 sperm were assayed per experimental condition for the presence or absence of the characteristic dark blue acrosomal crescent. As mentioned above, HCO 3− and BSA are necessary for capacitation. BSA has been hypothesized to function as a cholesterol acceptor for release of this sterol from the sperm plasma membrane, and HCO 3− has a role in the regulation of sperm pHi and cAMP metabolism. Hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane has also been associated with capacitation. However, it is not established whether hyperpolarization is upstream, downstream, or independent of the other signaling pathways involved in capacitation. β-Cyclodextrins are cyclic heptasaccharides known for their ability to bind cholesterol; we have demonstrated previously (26Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) that in the presence of these compounds cholesterol is released from the sperm plasma membrane. This cholesterol-efflux initiates signaling events leading to capacitation (26Visconti P.E. Galantino-Homer H. Ning X. Moore G.D. Valenzuela J.P. Jorgez C.J. Alvarez J.G. Kopf G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3235-3242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). When BSA is replaced by 1 mm 2-OH-p-β-CD in complete medium, cauda epididymal mouse sperm are hyperpolarized after 45 min of incubation, similarly to the control using 5 mg/ml BSA (Fig.2 and data not shown). In contrast, in media lacking BSA or β-cyclodextrin the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization did not occur (Fig. 2). In addition, when the cholesterol-binding sites of BSA were saturated with 5 μmcholesterol SO 4−, the capacitation-associated hyperpolarization of the sperm plasma membrane was inhibited (Fig.3). This concentration of cholesterol SO 4− has already been demonstrated to inhibit other capacitation-dependent processes such as the increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and the zona pellucida-induced acrosome reaction (34Visconti P.E. Ning X. Fornes M.W. Alvarez J.G. Stein P. Connors S.A. Kopf G.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 214: 429-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). This experiment further suggests that cholesterol efflux is involved in the regulation of the sperm plasma membrane potential.Figure 3Saturation of cholesterol-binding sites by cholesterol SO 4− inhibits the capacitation-associated membrane hyperpolarization. A–D, mouse caudal epididymal sperm were incubated in Whitten's media containing 5 mg/ml BSA for 5 (A and C) or 60 (B andD) min at 37 °C in the presence (C andD) or absence (A and B) of 5 μm cholesterol SO 4−. Sperm plasma membrane potential determination in each case was performed as described in Fig. 1. E, the data in this graph represent the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments including the experiment depicted in A–D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To evaluate the role of HCO 3− in the sperm plasma membrane hyperpolarization, cauda mouse sperm were incubated in HCO 3−-free medium in the presence of 1 mm2-OH-p-β-CD or 5 mg/ml BSA, and the plasma membrane potential was measured at different periods. In the absence of HCO 3−, the sperm plasma membrane potential remained constant in both cases (+2-OH-p-β-CD-HCO 3− (Fig. 2, Aand D); +BSA-HCO 3− (data not shown)). Altogether, these results suggest that similarly to other capacitation-related processes, cholesterol acceptors and HCO 3− play a role in the regulation of the sperm plasma membrane potential. Because HCO 3− is negatively charged, we evaluated whether the addition of HCO 3− to the sperm was able to modulate directly the membrane potential. As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, addition of HCO 3− to a final concentration of 5 mm induced a hyperpolarization of 15 ± 3 mV in a sperm population. Other anions such as Cl− (Fig. 4, A and B), I−, Br−, NO 3− (data not shown) did not elicit hyperpolarization at the same concentration. The possibility of non-specific interactions between HCO 3−and the positive carbocyanine dye was discarded because this anion did not change the fluorescence measurement in the absence of sperm. In addition, the HCO 3−-elicited hyperpolarization was also observed using the oxonol DiSBAC2-(3), a negatively charged dye (Fig. 4 C). In contrast to carbocyanines, when hyperpolarization occurs, oxonol dyes are released, and a decreased fluorescence is observed (Molecular Probes Manual). These data suggest that an HCO 3− electrogenic permeability is present in mouse sperm. Several hypotheses that can account for this HCO 3−hyperpolarizing current are summarized in Fig.5 A. First, the possibility of non-specific anion channels (model 1) can be discarded because other anions are not able to hyperpolarize the sperm membrane (see above). It is possible that an HCO 3−/Cl− antiporter (model 2) is present in sperm as suggested previously (15Visconti P.E. Muschietti J.P. Flawia M.M. Tezon J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Visconti P.E. Stewart-Savage J. Blasco A. Battaglia L. Miranda P. Kopf G.S. Tezon J.G. Biol.

Because HCO 3−/Cl− exchanger is electroneutral, HCO 3−–elicited hyperpolarization could be produced indirectly by an HCO 3−-dependent increas"

Channel function was evident even in receptors that were truncated at position 380 indicating that only a small portion of the cytosolic region is required for channel activity. Surprisingly, truncations in the region between residues 551 and 581 resulted in non-functional receptors with no detectable cell surface expression in HEK-293 cells.

P2X7 receptor 3′-o-(4-benzoyl)benzoyl ATP enhanced green fluorescent protein fetal bovine serum fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline analysis of variance fluorescence-activated cell sorting lipopolysaccharide The P2X7R1 is a ligand-gated ion channel and the seventh member of the P2X family (1Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Google Scholar). Exposure to ATP or the more potent agonist BzATP to the P2X7R renders the P2X7R permeant to Na+, K+, and Ca2+ (2Virginio C. MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Google Scholar). Repeated or prolonged application of either agonist induces the formation of a cytolytic pore that is permeable to larger cations such as positively charged ethidium orN-methyl-d-glucamine (3Nuttle L.C. Dubyak G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13988-13996Google Scholar, 4Hibell A.D. Thompson K.M. Simon J. Xing M. Humphrey P.P. Michel A.D. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 639-648Google Scholar). The ability of the P2X7R to form pores is dependent on experimental conditions. Factors such as the duration of the agonist application, the presence of divalent cations, extracellular pH, receptor density, and receptor species influence pore formation (1Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Google Scholar, 4Hibell A.D. Thompson K.M. Simon J. Xing M. Humphrey P.P. Michel A.D. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch.

Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C943-C953Google Scholar). The conversion from channel to pore state may reflect either a conformational change within the receptor's selectivity filter (7Khakh B.S. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1999; 23: 653-658Google Scholar) or the successive oligomerization of additional P2X7R subunits (8Cockcroft S. Gomperts B.D. Nature. 1979; 279: 541-542Google Scholar). We recently examined whether the P2X7R formed clusters (9Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Google Scholar) upon agonist activation, as a prelude to density-dependent pore formation. We found that, unlike the P2X2R, which clusters upon agonist activation (1–2 μm in size) (10Khakh B.S. Smith W.B. Chiu C.S. Ju D. Davidson N. Lester H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5288-5293Google Scholar), the P2X7R does not exist in clusters in the basal state or upon receptor activation (9Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Google Scholar). Although receptor density regulates pore formation in cells that endogenously express the P2X7R (6Gudipaty L. Humphreys B.D. Buell G. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: C943-C953Google Scholar), a localized increase in receptor density or clusters is not associated with P2X7 pore formation. The P2X7R shows structural homology with other P2X family members, consisting of two transmembrane domains connected by a large extracellular loop. The extracellular loop contains conserved cysteine, lysine, and glycine residues along with a number of potentialN-linked glycosylation sites, all of which contribute to the structural constraints required for ATP binding (11Newbolt A.

The C terminus of the P2X7R is 120 amino acids longer than any of the other P2X members. This long C-terminal domain (∼240 amino acids) appears to modulate the function of the P2X7R, because the removal of this region tempers the receptor's response to ATP. In particular, the removal of the last 177 amino acids (to yield P2X7-(1–418)) abolishes pore formation without affecting channel properties (1Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Google Scholar, 14Klapperstuck M. Buttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 25-35Google Scholar). Investigation of a 1–439 truncated human P2X7 receptor inXenopus oocytes revealed an altered kinetic response to ATP applications, thought to be related to a difference in the agonist binding site of the truncated receptor compared with the full-length P2X7R (14Klapperstuck M. Buttner C. Schmalzing G. Markwardt F. J. Physiol. 2001; 534: 25-35Google Scholar). Furthermore, when the human P2X7R is truncated at residue 415, it does not exhibit cell surface expression (15Worthington R.A. Smart M.L. Gu B.J. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Wiley J.S. Barden J.A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 43-46Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the cytosolic C-terminal of the P2X7R has supported the idea that the C-terminal region is important for receptor function. Denlinger and colleagues (16Denlinger L.C. Fisette P.L. Sommer J.A. Watters J.J. Prabhu U. Dubyak G.R. Proctor R.A. Bertics P.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1871-1876Google Scholar) identified a putative lipopolysaccharide binding domain and went on to corroborate this sequence analysis with biochemical evidence that this putative domain actually binds lipopolysaccharide. In a large scale proteomic analysis, Kim and co-workers (17Kim M. Jiang L.H. Wilson H.L. North R.A. Surprenant A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6347-6358Google Scholar) identified numerous putative protein partners, many of which are thought to interact with the C-terminal region. In particular, epithelial membrane proteins were found to interact with the C-terminal tail of the P2X7R and are involved in cell blebbing (18Wilson H.L. Wilson S.A. Surprenant A. North R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34017-34023Google Scholar). Clinical investigations have shed further light on the role of the C-terminal region and have demonstrated that an E496A polymorphism seen in the human P2X7R is associated with a loss of function and the appearance of CLL in patients harboring this amino acid change (19Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Google Scholar). Further evidence for a role of the C-terminal in regulating pore formation comes from studies of rat, human, and mouse P2X7 receptors. There are differences in the ability of these receptors to form pores, with the rat P2X7R considered as the “best” (4Hibell A.D. Thompson K.M. Simon J. Xing M. Humphrey P.P. Michel A.D. Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 2001; 363: 639-648Google Scholar). Augmented pore-forming ability can be conferred to the human receptor by substitution of the human intracellular C-terminal region with the corresponding region of the rat P2X7R (20Rassendren F. Buell G.N. Virginio C. Collo G. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5482-5486Google Scholar), suggesting that residues within this domain participate in pore formation. Thus, our accumulated knowledge is consistent with the idea that the C terminus is an important modulator of receptor function and dysfunction with significant clinical manifestations. Yet, little is known about the identity of functional domains of the C terminus that presumably underlie these important functions. In the present study we sought to define such functional domains of the C-terminal region by a systematic study of a series of P2X7 truncations and point mutants. Pore formation was determined by ethidium ion uptake in HEK-293 cells, and channel conductance was measured in Xenopus oocytes with the two-electrode voltage clamp method. We present experimental evidence that P2X7R pore formation is dependent upon a distal region of the C terminus, and this region modulates the surface expression of the pore- forming P2X7R. The wild type clone of rat P2X7R (accession number X95882, a kind gift from Dr. Gary Buell) was used in these studies. Truncated P2X7 receptors were created using standard PCR protocols. AHindIII and EcoRI restriction site was incorporated at the 5′ and 3′ ends of each PCR product. All PCR products were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia) and amplified using competent DH5α cells. The 1-Pro582Gly construct was created as above, but a point mutation was introduced at the appropriate position within the reverse primer (reverse: 5′-GCG GAA TTC TCA GCCGAA CTC CTT CCG GAT CTT CC). A total of seven separate sites were targeted for glycine substitution. The following residues were chosen for our studies: Cys548, Cys572, Arg574, Lys576, Glu580, Phe581, and Pro582 with each residue (in the full-length P2X7R) mutated to glycine. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Stratagene's QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Integrated Sciences, Willoughby, New South Wales, Australia) as per the manufacturer's instructions, and the forward and reverse primers for each mutant were designed as recommended. The forward and reverse primers for each mutant are listed as follows: C548G forward: 5′-C AGC AAG CTG CGA CACGGT GCG TAC AGG AGC TAT GCC; C548G reverse: 5′-GGC ATA GCT CCT GTA CGC ACC GTG TCG CAG CTT GCT G; C572G forward: 5′-GCC ATT CTG CCC AGC GGC TGC CGC TGG AAG ATC CGG; C572G reverse: 5′-CCG GAT CTT CCA GCG GCA GCC GCT GGG CAG AAT GGC; R574G forward: 5′-CTG CCC AGC TGC TGC GGC TGG AAG ATC CGG AAG; R574G reverse: 5′-CTT CCG GAT CTT CCA GCC GCA GCA GCT GGG CAG; K576G forward: 5′-CC AGC TGC TGC CGC TGGGGG ATC CGG AAG GAG TTC CC; K576G reverse: 5′-GG GAA CTC CTT CCG GAT CCC CCA GCG GCA GCA GCT GG; E580G forward: 5′-GG AAG ATC CGG AAG GGG TTC CCC AAG ACC CAG; E580G reverse: 5′-CTG GGT CTT GGG GAA CCC CTT CCG GAT CTT CC; F581G forward: 5′-GG AAG ATC CGG AAG GAG GGC GGG AAG ACC CAG GGG; F581G reverse: 5′-CCC CTG GGT CTT GGG GCC CTC CTT CCG GAT CTT CC; P582G forward: 5′- G ATC CGG AAG GAG TTCGGC AAG ACC CAG GGG CAG; P582G reverse: 5′-CTG CCC CTG GGT CTT GCC GAA CTC CTT CCG GAT C. Base changes introducing the mutations are in boldface type and underlined. Three mutants, Cys572 → Gly, Glu580→ Gly, and Phe581 → Gly, and the wild type rat P2X7R were subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) to create four EGFP fusion proteins. A single set of forward and reverse primers was used to subclone all mutants and the wild type rat P2X7R into the pEGFP-N1 vector, with an XhoI and aKpnI site introduced at the 5′ and 3′ ends, and the stop codon was deleted. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing (Australian Genome Research Facility, St. Lucia, Queensland, Australia). For electrophysiological studies, the truncated receptor constructs were linearized with XbaI in preparation for transcription run-off. In vitro transcription was performed using Ambion's T7 mMessage mMachine mRNA kit (GeneWorks, Thebarton, South Australia, Australia) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The full-length, capped cRNAs were purified using diethyl-pyrocarbonate H2O-equilibrated Clontech Chroma Spin-100 columns (Progen Industries, Brisbane, Australia). cRNA samples were electrophoresed on a denaturing agarose gel to determine the quantity, quality, and size of the transcript. HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml). For ethidium ion uptake experiments HEK-293 cells were dislodged using Trypsin-EDTA and seeded into 96-well plates, then transfected 24 h later (or when confluency had reached ∼75%). 30 μl of Effectene buffer, 0.8 μl of enhancer, 2.5 μl of Effectene reagent (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Victoria, Australia) were assembled with 0.8 μg of sample DNA. This mixture was used to transfect eight wells. Following a 12-h period the transfection reagent was replaced with fresh medium. For imaging studies, the HEK-293 and COS-7 cells were seeded onto poly-l-lysine-treated coverslips. Cells were transfected with the wild type rat P2X7-EGFP, Cys572 → Gly-EGFP, Glu580 → Gly-EGFP, or Phe581 → Gly-EGFP using the Effectene transfection reagents as described previously (9Smart M.L. Panchal R.G. Bowser D.N. Williams D.A. Petrou S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C77-C84Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were also transfected with the truncated P2X7 receptors and C-terminal mutants in preparation for calcium influx studies. Pore formation was examined in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the wild type rat P2X7R, truncated P2X7 receptors, and C-terminal mutants. A plate reader (Wallac 1420, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used to determine ethidium ion uptake in these cells. Three days post-transfection the cells were washed once with low divalent HEPES buffer (in millimolar; NaCl 147, KCl 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10, CaCl2 0.1, pH 7.4). Basal ethidium ion fluorescence was assessed once the wash buffer was replaced with low divalent HEPES supplemented with ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml). Fluorescence signals from ethidium ion were excited with the 485 ± 15-nm band of a 75-watt tungsten-halogen lamp, and emission greater then 615 ± 8.5 nm was collected. Once background ethidium ion fluorescence was measured, this “ethidium only” solution was replaced with low divalent HEPES supplemented with BzATP (100 μm) and ethidium bromide (10 μg/ml). Ethidium ion fluorescence was measured at four separate locations within each well, and an entire plate was read ten times within a 30-min period. All ethidium ion uptake experiments were carried out at 37 °C. HEK-293 cells were loaded with fluo-4 AM for 20 min at 37 °C then washed twice before experiments. Cells were illuminated with the 488-nm line of a 100-milliwatt argon ion laser and viewed on an MRC-1024 (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, New South Wales, Australia) confocal microscope. Data was collected using the single-green fluorophore emission filter set. Fluorescence signals from fluo-4 were sampled every 3 s and collected using a software module (Laser Sharp Timecourse, version 3.1) for a period of 5 min. Recordings were made in high divalent HEPES buffer (in millimolar; NaCl 147, KCl 2, HEPES 10, glucose 10, CaCl2 1, pH 7.4), supplemented with BzATP (50 μm). The fluo-4 fluorescence intensity recorded over a 5-min period was integrated to give an index of channel activity. This provided an estimation of the amount of calcium entry through the P2X channel versus the calcium release from internal stores by P2Y activation. Transfected cells were illuminated with the 488-nm line of a 100-milliwatt argon ion laser and viewed on a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope. Fluorescence signals from EGFP were viewed while cells were perfused with a low divalent HEPES buffer. Oocytes from adult female Xenopus laeviswere surgically removed and prepared as outlined previously (21Petrou S. Ugur M. Drummond R.M. Singer J.J. Walsh J.V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 339-345Google Scholar). Stage 5 or 6 oocytes were injected with cRNA-encoding wild type rat P2X7R, truncated P2X7 receptors, or the C-terminal mutants and were stored at 18 °C for 3 days prior to experimentation. For two electrode voltage clamp recordings, oocytes were impaled with two glass electrodes containing 3 m KCl and held at a membrane potential of −70mV with an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Oocytes were perfused (at 2 ml/min) with a low divalent ND96 solution (in millimolar; NaCl 96, KCl 2, BaCl2 0.1, HEPES 5, pH 7.5) administered with a gravity-fed manifold perfusion system. 1 mm ATP was added for a period of 20 s and washed, and the inward current trace was monitored until full recovery was observed. HEK-293 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.02 mg/ml gentamicin. 75-cm2 flasks of HEK-293 cells (∼90% confluency) were transfected with 15 μg of the wild type rat P2X7R, truncated P2X7 receptors, or the C-terminal mutants, using the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent protocol (Invitrogen). After 40–44 h, cells were collected by mechanical scraping. Cell suspensions (90 μl of 5 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640, 10% FBS) were then incubated with human group AB serum (10 μl), 7-aminoactinomycin D (20 μg/ml), and FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human P2X7 monoclonal antibody (clone L4, 60 μg/ml) (22Buell G. Chessell I.P. Michel A.D. Collo G. Salazzo M. Herren S. Gretener D. Grahames C. Kaur R. Kosco-Vilbois M.H. Humphrey P.P. Blood. 1998; 92: 3521-3528Google Scholar) at room temperature (∼22 °C) for 20 min, before washing with PBS (pH 7.2). Labeled cells were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS and analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer (San Jose, CA), as previously described (19Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Google Scholar). The isotype control was a murine FITC-conjugated IgG2b (DAKO-Cytomation, Glostrup, Denmark). Values were normalized to the absolute value of expression of the wild type P2X7R surface expression and corrected for the vector alone control. Electrophysiological analysis of two electrode voltage clamp results was performed using CLAMPFIT module of P-Clamp 8.1 (Axon Instruments, Forster City, CA) and ORIGIN 6.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA). Data in the text and graphs are shown as means ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed using a one-way ANOVA (Tukey, family error rate of 0.05). The number of wells, cells, or oocytes examined for each experimental protocol is presented in parentheses. A series of truncated P2X7 receptors was constructed and subjected to functional analysis so that the functional domains of the intracellular C-terminal domain could be identified (Fig. 1). Truncated P2X7 receptors were tested for their ability to form ethidium ion permeant pores using a plate reader assay designed for rapid screening of transfected HEK-293 cells. Cells transfected with the wild type P2X7R or vector alone were also assayed for ethidium ion uptake following addition of 100 μm BzATP (Fig.2 A). The wild type receptor gave a robust and highly reproducible increase in ethidium ion fluorescence that developed over a period of 30 min. The relative fluorescence intensity at this time point was chosen for all subsequent analyses of ethidium ion uptake. Plate reader analysis of ethidium ion uptake of truncated receptors revealed a strong relationship between the truncation position and ethidium ion uptake (Fig. 2 B). Under no circumstances could we detect ethidium ion fluorescence for any receptor that was truncated upstream of residue 582. By contrast, all constructs that were 582 residues or longer in length displayed ethidium ion fluorescence levels identical to that of the full-length receptor. Thus, removal of one residue, proline 582, resulted in a switch from wild type ethidium ion uptake to complete absence of uptake. To examine this further we substituted this proline with glycine, and ethidium ion uptake was re-assessed (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, this 1-Pro582Gly truncation mutant displayed a level of ethidium ion uptake that fell almost halfway between the levels measured with the 1–582 truncation mutant and the full-length receptor.Figure 2Pore and channel activity measured in HEK-293 cells transfected with truncated P2X7 receptors.

Thearrow indicates the time at which BzATP (50 μm) was applied.

MacKenzie A. North R.A. Surprenant A. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 335-346Google Scholar). Calcium influx was determined by the change in fluo-4 fluorescence upon the addition of 50 μm BzATP (Fig.2 C). The application of BzATP to HEK-293 cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1(+) vector caused an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, presumably by the release of calcium from intracellular stores via activation of endogenously expressed P2Y receptors (Fig. 2 C). This increase in calcium by P2Y receptors upon BzATP application has been previously reported for native HEK-293 cells (23Qi Z. Murase K. Obata S. Sokabe M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 131: 370-374Google Scholar). The addition of 50 μm BzATP to HEK-293 cells transfected with the full-length rat P2X7R caused a sustained increase in fluo-4 fluorescence, which was interpreted as an influx of calcium through the P2X7 channel (Fig. 2 C). Reduction of this type of data by mathematical integration of the Ca2+ levels over time was a good discriminator of the difference between a sustained influx and the transient, P2Y-elicited store release of Ca2+. Furthermore, it correlated well with some whole cell current recordings made by patch clamp (data not shown) validating this approach as a rapid method for analysis of P2X7R channel properties. Analysis of truncated receptors showed that a sustained increase in Ca2+ was observed in transfected HEK-293 cells with the constructs, 1–380, 1–400, 1–418, 1–460, 1–500, 1–540, 1–550, 1–582, and 1-Pro582Gly (Fig. 2 D), whereas the following constructs failed to produce a sustained increase in Ca2+ influx: 1–360, 1–560, 1–570, 1–580, and 1–581 (Fig. 2 D). In contrast to pore function, channel function was clearly evident in many of the shorter truncation constructs. We next investigated whether the loss of P2X7R channel function seen in certain truncated receptors may be associated with a decrease in plasmalemma expression. Cell surface expression was determined using flow cytometry with the L4 human P2X7 antibody (19Gu B.J. Zhang W. Worthington R.A. Sluyter R. Dao-Ung P. Petrou S. Barden J.A. Wiley J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11135-11142Google Scholar). This FITC-conjugated antibody recognizes an extracellular epitope on the human P2X7R. HEK-293 cells were transfected with each of the truncated P2X7 receptors. Two days post transfection, cells were suspended in PBS and P2X7R surface expression was quantified using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Clear differences in cell surface expression were observed, with expression levels varying from undetectable to twice that of wild type receptor. For the most part cell surface expression correlated well with channel function seen in Fig. 2 D with two notable exceptions, the 1–540 and 1–550 truncations, which displayed significant channel function but had negligible surface expression. Clearly, function requires cell surface expression, and this may represent a limitation of the FACS technique in studying mutant receptors where differences in epitope presentation and the consequent reduced antibody binding may be incorrectly interpreted as a lack of surface expression. The other noteworthy result is that the 1–582 truncation displayed almost twice the level of cell surface expression compared with that of control. Interestingly, activation of this truncation gave a robust Ca2+ response (Fig.2 D). In all cases, truncated receptors that displayed a loss of both channel and pore function could not be detected at the cell surface (Fig. 2 D). As a further check for cell surface expression N- and C-terminal GFP-tagged 1–418, 1–570, and 1–580 truncation constructs were made and examined using confocal microscopy (data not shown). Although neither of the N- and C-terminal-tagged GFP truncations displayed surface expression, a fluorescence signal was detected in the cytoplasm, indicating that these receptors were being translated and expressed. The channel properties of the truncated receptors were also examined inXenopus oocytes. In most cases, the application of 1 mm ATP caused a rapid current (I1) followed by a delayed current (I2; Fig.3 A) and again correlated quite well with the Ca2+ influx data shown in Fig. 2 D. As would be expected from the data, in HEK-293 cells negligible current responses were observed with the 1–360, 1–570, and 1–580 truncations (Fig. 3 B). Two interesting exceptions are truncations 1–560 and 1–581, which showed no significant channel activity in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 2 D) but gave robust current responses inXenopus oocytes (Fig. 3 B). The I1 and I2 components of current development were affected differently by the same truncation, suggesting the mechanisms responsible for these two distinct functional phases may also be structurally distinct. Fig. 3 B summarizes the findings above and presents in a clear fashion several key observations: 1) Truncation between residues 551 and 581 results in a complete abolition of ethidium ion uptake, channel function, and absence of cell surface expression. 2) Truncation upstream results in restoration of cell surface expression and channel function to varying degrees but significantly above control. 3) The ability of the receptor to accumulate ethidium ions is not similarly restored. 4) Truncation at residue 380 results in a receptor that can still function as an ion channel. Thus, the region between 551 and 581 appears to regulate cell surface expression in conjunction with pore formation, defined by the ability to rapidly accumulate ethidium ions upon application of BzATP. To further elucidate the role of the 551–581 region, single residues within this domain were targeted for glycine mutagenesis. We also targeted a cysteine residue at position 548, close to the extremity of the region to examine its role in receptor function. A phenylalanine at position 581 was replaced with glycine"

Recently, both α1β1 and α2β1integrins have been shown to recognize triple-helical GFOGER (where single letter amino acid nomenclature is used, O = hydroxyproline) or GFOGER-like motifs found in collagens, despite their distinct binding specificity for various collagen subtypes. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism whereby the latest member in the integrin family, α11β1, recognizes collagens using C2C12 cells transfected with α11 cDNA and the bacterially expressed recombinant α11 I domain. The ligand binding properties of α11β1 were compared with those of α2β1. Mg2+-dependent α11β1 binding to type I collagen required micromolar Ca2+ but was inhibited by 1 mmCa2+, whereas α2β1-mediated binding was refractory to millimolar concentrations of Ca2+. The bacterially expressed recombinant α11 I domain preference for fibrillar collagens over collagens IV and VI was the same as the α2 I domain. Despite the difference in Ca2+ sensitivity, α11β1-expressing cells and the α11 I domain bound to helical GFOGER sequences in a manner similar to α2β1-expressing cells and the α2 I domain. Modeling of the α I domain-collagen peptide complexes could partially explain the observed preference of different I domains for certain GFOGER sequence variations. In summary, our data indicate that the GFOGER sequence in fibrillar collagens is a common recognition motif used by α1β1, α2β1, and also α11β1 integrins. Although α10and α11 chains show the highest sequence identity, α2 and α11 are more similar with regard to collagen specificity. Future studies will reveal whether α2β1 and α11β1integrins also show overlapping biological functions.

However, this interaction most likely involves RGD motifs in denatured or partially unfolded collagen chains.Studies of collagen-binding integrins in various in vitroassays show that they take part in cell adhesion, cell migration, control of collagen synthesis, matrix metalloproteinase synthesis, remodeling of collagen matrices, and influence such complex processes as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, angiogenesis, platelet adhesion/aggregation, and epithelial tubulogenesis (10Bouvard D.

Biochem. 1994; 225: 975-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In accordance with this, when the α1 integrin chain is expressed in K562 cells, α1β1 will bind type IV collagen, but it requires activation to bind laminin-1 (18Wong L.D. Sondheim A.B. Zachow K.R.

Early studies using antibodies showed that α2β1 on some cells (melanoma LOX cells), but not others (fibroblasts, platelets), mediated the binding to laminin-1 (26Elices M.J. Hemler M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The rather restricted expression of α10β1 to cartilage indicates that the ligands are to be found in the cartilage extracellular matrix. Intriguingly, using recombinant protein, the collagen binding preference of the α10 I domain is most similar to that of the α1 I domain, so that the α10 I domain prefers the basement membrane collagen IV and the beaded filament-forming collagen VI over the interstitial collagens I and II (27Tulla M.

In the same study, mutational analysis of the I domains showed that the amino acid residues Arg-218 in α1 and α10 and Asp-219 in α2 are involved in determining this collagen preference.α11 was initially detected in differentiating human fetal muscle cells (28Gullberg D. Velling T. Sjöberg G. Sejersen T. Dev. Dyn. 1995; 204: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). α11 protein and mRNA expression analysis in human embryos, however, revealed that expression is localized to mesenchymal non-muscle cells in areas of highly organized interstitial collagen networks. No expression was seen in muscle cellsin vivo (29Tiger C.-F. Fougerousse F. Grundström G. Velling T. Gullberg D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the developing skeletal system, α10β1 and α11β1thus show nonoverlapping, complementary expression patterns (11Gullberg D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Prog. Histochem.

The α1 I and α2 I integrin binding site located within triple-helical α1 I CB3 has been identified as GFOGER (31Knight C.G. Morton L.F. Onley D.J. Peachey A.R. Messent A.J. Smethurst P.A.

Two related sequences, GLOGER 2Where single letter amino acid nomenclature is used, O = hydroxyproline. 2Where single letter amino acid nomenclature is used, O = hydroxyproline.and GASGER, were identified elsewhere in collagen I (33Xu Y.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38981-38989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and other GER-containing sequences in the collagen chains can also mediate cell adhesion through α2β1. 3R. W. Farndale, P. R.-M. Siljander, and C. G. Knight, in preparation. 3R. W. Farndale, P. R.-M. Siljander, and C. G. Knight, in preparation.The GER motif thus appears to be a major cell adhesion motif used by collagen-binding integrins.Examination of the crystal structure of an α2 I domain-GFOGER complex suggested that other hydrophobic residues might replace phenylalanine, which together with the glutamate and arginine residues provided the main side chain interactions between the collagen-like peptide and the integrin (34Emsley J. Knight C.G. Farndale R.W. Barnes M.J. Liddington R.C. Cell. 2000; 101: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Interactions also occurred with the main chain carbonyl group of the hydroxyproline residue, suggesting that hydroxyproline itself may not be required specifically for collagen-integrin interaction.Arginine interacts with negatively charged Asp-219 on the surface of the α2 I domain, and although this appears a relatively nonspecific interaction, GEK will not substitute fully in human platelets. The ligand binding groove of the α2 I domain is relatively deep compared with that of α1. Thus, the coordination of Mg2+ in the metal ion dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) may only be achieved by glutamate residues from the GER motif, aspartate being too short for this purpose. This may not be the case for other integrins, and the abundance of GDR triplets within the collagens suggests the possibility that GDR motifs might serve as well. The present study was designed in part to test the possibility that α11, which lacks an acidic residue equivalent to Asp-219, and whose structure is not yet defined, might recognize GEK and GDR triplets, both of which occur frequently in human collagens.Other modes of collagen binding also exist, and α1β1 binds to collagen type IV using the amino acids arginine and aspartate contributed from different collagen α chains (35Eble J.A. Golbik R. Mann K. Kuhn K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4795-4802Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 36Golbik R. Eble J.A. Ries A. Kuhn K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The residues recognized by α1β1 in collagen XIII, lacking a GFOGER sequence, have not been identified. Studies with fragments of laminins have shown that the I domain integrin binding sites are present in the short arm of the α chain, but the exact region(s) has not yet been mapped (13Colognato-Pyke H.

First, the GER glutamate residue binds directly to a Mg2+ ion coordinated within the I domain MIDAS. Other divalent cations will serve this purpose, notably Mn2+ and Co2+, but in nature such ions are unlikely to be sufficiently abundant to contribute significantly to the adhesion process. Integrins possess several other divalent cation binding sites, three or four within the blades of the α subunit β propeller, and perhaps two within the β subunit I-like domain. Some of these sites likely bind Ca2+ and account for the biphasic role of Ca2+ in the competence of the integrins. Adhesion of collagen to α2β1in human platelets, in common with the binding of ligand by other integrins, has recently been shown to require micromolar Ca2+ (37Onley D.J. Knight C.G. Tuckwell D.S. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24560-24564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and to be inhibited by millimolar Ca2+. Conceivably the latter effect reflects competition for Ser-123 lying between Mg2+ in the MIDAS and Ca2+ in the ADMIDAS sites of the β subunit I-like domain, such that high levels of Ca2+ render the integrin β subunit incapable of regulating α subunit function properly. The requirement for Ca2+ appears to differ even for the same integrin when expressed in different cells. Thus, although a biphasic effect of Ca2+ on α2β1competence in platelets can clearly be shown, the sensitivity of α2β1 to either high or low levels of Ca2+ in HT1080 cells is much less obvious. 4R. W. Farndale, P. R.-M. Siljander, and C. G. Knight, unpublished observation. 4R. W. Farndale, P. R.-M. Siljander, and C. G. Knight, unpublished observation.In the present study we set out to study further the mechanism whereby α2β1 and α11β1integrins bind collagens. Our data suggest that the approximatedKd of the α11 I domain for type I collagen is higher than that of the α2 I domain and that in C2C12 cells the α11β1-mediated binding to collagen I, but not that of α2β1, is sensitive to the presence of Ca2+. However, both integrins display a similar collagen specificity, and both recognize the helical GFOGER sequence. Modeling of α2 I and α11 I domain-ligand complexes could in part explain the observed differences in α2 I and α11 I domain binding to different collagen peptides. The results are potentially promising for future attempts to generate reagents effective in blocking multiple collagen-binding integrins simultaneously.MATERIALS AND METHODSProduction of Human Recombinant Integrin α1 I, α2 I, and α11 I Domains as Fusion ProteinscDNAs encoding α1 I and α2 I domains were generated by PCR as described earlier (27Tulla M. Pentikäinen O.T. Viitasalo T. Käpylä J. Impola U. Nykvist P. Nissinen L. Johnson M.S. Heino J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48206-48212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) using human integrin α1 and α2 cDNAs as templates. Vectors pGEX-4T-3 and pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences) were used to generate recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of human α1 I and α2 I domains, respectively. Human integrin α11 cDNA (4Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) was used as a template when the α11 I domain was generated by PCR. The PCR product having BamHI and EcoRI sites was cloned to pGEX-KT, and the DNA sequence was checked by sequencing the whole insert. The same vector was used for expression of recombinant GST fusion proteins of the human α11 I domain. CompetentEscherichia coli BL21 cells were transformed with the plasmids for protein production. 500 ml of LB medium (Biokar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was innoculated with a 50-ml overnight culture of BL21/pα1 I, BL21/pα2I, or BL21/pα11 I, and the cultures were grown at 37 °C until the A 600 of the suspension reached 0.6–1.0. Cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for an additional 4–6 h before harvesting by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in PBS (pH 7.4) and then lysed by sonication followed by the addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 2%. After incubation for 30 min on ice, suspensions were centrifuged, and supernatants were pooled. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the lysate, which was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with gentle agitation. The lysate was then centrifuged, the supernatant was removed, and glutathione-Sepharose with bound fusion protein was transferred into disposable chromatography columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with PBS, and fusion proteins were eluted using 30 mm glutathione. Purified recombinant and glutathione-tagged α1 I, α2I, and α11 I domains were analyzed by SDS and native PAGE. The recombinant α1 I domain produced was 227 amino acids in length, corresponding to amino acids 123–338 of the whole α1 integrin, whereas the α2 I domain was 223 amino acids long, which corresponded to amino acids 124–339 of the whole α2 integrin. The carboxyl termini of the α1 I and α2 I domains contained 10 and 6 non-integrin amino acids, respectively. Recombinant α11 I domain contains a total of 204 amino acids: at the amino terminus there are 2 extra residues (GS) before the α11 I domain, which starts from CQTY and ends with SLEG (residues 159–354); at the carboxyl terminus there are 6 extra amino acids (EFIVTD). The recombinant α11 I domain contains some GST as an impurity caused by endogenous protease activity during expression and purification. Recombinant I domains were used as GST fusion proteins for collagen binding experiments.Synthesis of PeptidesPeptides were synthesized as carboxyl-terminal amides on TentaGel R RAM resin in a PerSeptive Biosystems 9050 Plus PepSynthesizer exactly as described in our earlier studies (30Gullberg D.

Peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a column of Vydac 219TP101522 using a linear gradient of 5–45% acetonitrile in water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions containing homogeneous product were identified by analytical HPLC on a column of Vydac 219TP54, pooled, and freeze dried. All peptides were found to be of the correct theoretical mass by mass spectrometry. The triple-helical stability of each peptide was assessed by polarimetry as described previously.Solid Phase Binding Assay for α1 I, α2 I, and α11 I DomainsThe coating of a 96-well high binding microtiter plate (Nunc) was done by exposure to 0.1 ml of PBS containing 5 μg/cm2(15 μg/ml) collagens or 20 μg/ml synthetic triple-helical collagen peptides overnight at 4 °C. Type I rat (rat tail) collagen, type IV mouse (basement membrane of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma) collagen, and type IV human “cut” (human placenta) collagen were purchased from Sigma. Type IV human collagen and type II bovine collagen were purchased from Biodesign International and Chemicon, respectively. Type I bovine (bovine dermal) collagen was from Cellon S. A. Blank wells were coated with a 1:1 solution of 0.1 ml Delfia® Diluent II (Wallac) and PBS. Residual protein absorption sites on all wells were blocked with a 1:1 solution of 0.1 ml of Delfia® Diluent II and PBS. Recombinant proteins α1 I-GST, α2 I-GST, and α11 I-GST were added to the coated wells at the desired concentration in Delfia® assay buffer and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Europium-labeled anti-GST antibody (Wallac) was then added (typically 1:1,000), and the mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. All incubations mentioned above were done in the presence of 2 mmMgCl2. Delfia® enhancement solution (Wallac) was added to each well, and the europium signal was measured by time-resolved fluorometry (Victor2 multilabel counter, Wallac). In every case, at least three parallel wells were analyzed.CellsMurine C2C12 myoblast cells from the American Type Culture Collection were provided by A. Starzinski-Powitz. The generation of C2C12 cells stably transfected with integrin α2 cDNA or integrin α11 cDNA has been described previously(29). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Statens veterinärmedicinska anstalt, Uppsala). The cells were grown to subconfluence and passaged every 2–3 days.AntibodiesRabbit antibodies to the cytoplasmic tail of α11integrin have been described previously (4Velling T. Kusche-Gullberg M. Sejersen T. Gullberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25735-25742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To immunoprecipitate β1 integrins, a polyclonal antibody to rat integrin β1 chain was used (38Gullberg D. Terracio L. Borg T.K. Rubin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12686-12694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation and ElectrophoresisCell cultures were washed three times in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium devoid of cysteine and methionine and metabolically labeled overnight in the presence of 25 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine (pro-Mix 35S cell labeling mix; Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were extracted from the tissue culture dishes by the addition of 1 ml of solubilization buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2) containing protease inhibitors (1 mmPefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Diagnostics), 1% aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Solubilized proteins were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g. The centrifuged supernatant was precleared by incubating with 100 μg/ml preimmune IgG and protein A-Sepharose CL4B (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h. After centrifugation, immune IgG was incubated with the extract for 2 h. Specifically bound proteins were recovered with protein A-Sepharose. The precipitate was washed three times with buffer A (1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) and three times with buffer B (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.15 mNaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2) prior to solubilization in electrophoresis sample buffer. Proteins were separated on 6% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and processed for fluorography.Cell Attachment AssayGeneral SetupLigands and metal ions are described separately for the two experiments. 24-well cell culture plates (Nunc) were coated with ligands (500 μl to a 2-cm2 well) diluted in PBS overnight at 4 °C, followed by blocking with 2% BSA in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and then washed in Puck's saline (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 4 mmNa2CO3, 5.5 mm d-glucose, pH 7.0). Transfected cells were trypsinized, washed four times in Puck's saline, deeded into the wells at a concentration of 250,000 cells/well, and were allowed to attach for 45 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Wells were washed three times in Puck's saline, and plates were rapidly frozen at −20 °C for later assay using the hexoseaminidase test as described previously (29Tiger C.-F. Fougerousse F. Grundström G. Velling T. Gullberg D. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For each cell line used, a cell number standard was made. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. To minimize errors from unequal trypsinization stress between cell lines and handling of plates, for example, data were normalized as follows. For each plate the adhesion to 10 μg/ml fibronectin (provided by S. Johansson, Uppsala University) was used as the 100% reference level, and the background found on BSA-only coated wells was used as the base-line (0%) reference level.Ca2+ Inhibition SetupWells were coated with 10 μg/ml bovine collagen type I (Vitrogen®100, Cohesion) or 10 μg/ml human plasma fibronectin. Wells were filled with Puck's saline, and MgCl2 + EGTA was added to obtain a final concentration (after addition of cells) of 2 mm MgCl2 and 0.01 mm EGTA. CaCl2 was added according to Fig.1.Cell Attachment to Synthetic Peptides24-well plates were coated with 10 μg/ml synthetic triple-helical collagen peptides at 4 °C overnight according to Fig. 4, or 10 μg/ml bovine collagen type I (Vitrogen®100), or 10 μg/ml fibronectin.

In this work, we used asCP mutants to investigate the mechanism underlying kindling. Using site-directed mutagenesis we showed that amino acids spatially surrounding Tyr66 in the chromophore are crucial for kindling. We propose a model of the kindling mechanism, in which the key event is chromophore turning or cis-trans isomerization. Using site-directed mutagenesis we also managed to transfer the kindling property to the two other coral chromoproteins. Remarkably, most kindling mutants were capable of both reversible and irreversible kindling. Also, we obtained novel variants that kindled upon blue light irradiation.

Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol.

This protein, named asCP, absorbs light effectively, with a maximum at 568 nm, and causes purple coloration of anemone tentacle tips. Initially nonfluorescent, asCP becomes fluorescent (kindles) in response to intense green light irradiation, with an excitation maximum at 575 nm and an emission maximum at 595 nm. The protein then relaxes back to its initial nonfluorescent state, or it can be quenched instantly by short blue light irradiation. Both kindling in green light and quenching in blue light are reversible processes for the wild-type protein. The nature of these striking changes remains unclear; here we propose an explanation based on the wild-type and mutant asCP properties. For heterologous expression of proteins, full-length coding regions were cloned into the pQE30 vector (Qiagen). Proteins fused to an N-terminal 6xHis tag were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using the Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by overlap extension PCR with primers containing the appropriate target substitutions (2Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Screening of E. coli colonies expressing mutant proteins was performed using a Nikon Optiphot fluorescent microscope and an Olympus US SZX12 fluorescent stereo microscope. Photographs were made using an Olympus DP50 camera. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Beckman DU520 UV/VIS spectrophotometer. A Varian Cary eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer was used to measure excitation-emission spectra and as a light source to determine the action spectrum for the quenching of asCP-A148G mutant. The following external light sources were used: 458 nm (Ar-ion laser line), 430–490 nm (fluorescent microscope filter), 460–490 nm (fluorescent microscope filter), 514 nm (Ar-ion laser line), 532 nm (Nd laser line), 543 nm (HeNe laser line), and 546 (±14 nm, fluorescent microscope filter) as the light sources for estimating asCP kindling and quenching optima; 430–490 nm (fluorescent microscope filter) and 460–490 nm (fluorescent microscope filter) as the quenching light sources for asCP and its mutants and as the kindling light sources for hcCP-N165A,G mutants; 532 nm (Nd laser line) and 546 (±14) nm (fluorescent microscope filter) as the kindling light sources for the asCP, its mutants and for those cgCP and hcCP mutants that kindle in green light. asCP kindles in response to green light and quenches in blue light. As the kindling light intensity is relatively high, it was difficult to measure the optimum kindling wavelength precisely. We roughly estimated kindling and quenching wavelength optima using different light sources. asCP irradiation at 532, 543, or 546 nm caused bright kindling (hereinafter referred to as kindling green light). However, the 514 nm light caused only low level kindling, but it quenched previously kindled asCP considerably, indicating a probable intersection with a blue quenching light. The blue light irradiation at 458, 430–490, or 460–490 nm caused no kindling and quenched previously kindled asCP. It is likely that the kindling optimum corresponds to the absorption peak at 568 nm (Fig.1 A). (Extinction coefficient = ∼120,000 m−1cm−1 according to our refined data. Previous studies showed a lower extinction coefficient, probably due to the incomplete protein maturation (1Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F. Gurskaya N.G. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Savitsky A.P. Markelov M.L. Zaraisky A.G. Zhao X. Fang Y. Tan W. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25879-25882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar)). The action spectrum for the quenching was determined precisely using an asCP mutant (see “asCP-A148G Mutant Study”). The intensity and duration of the green light illumination needed for kindling depend on several parameters: the protein sample thickness and transparency, protein concentration, and wavelength used. In the protein sample, kindling is observed when kindling speed (which depends both on irradiation power and duration) is higher than the kindled asCP relaxation speed. For example, irradiation of asCP expressing E. coli colony in fluorescent microscope through 10× objective (TRITC filter set, 100-W lamp) causes quick kindling, which reaches its maximum in ∼10–20 s. Irradiation through a 5× objective causes very slow kindling, which reaches its maximum in about 10 min. A quarter of 5× objective intensity causes no visible kindling. We also measured the relaxation kinetics of the kindled asCP at room temperature, which was shown to have a 7-s half-life. However, kindled asCP stayed fluorescent for a much longer period of time, for more than 24 h, upon immediate cooling with liquid nitrogen and subsequent placement at −70 °C. Currently, the x-ray structures for two GFP-like proteins are known, i.e.GFP itself and coral DsRed protein (3Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N. Nat.

These data can be used as three-dimensional models and are suitable for the analysis of asCP and other GFP-like fluorescent proteins (FPs) and nonfluorescent chromoproteins (CPs). According to the x-ray structure, Tyr66 of the GFP chromophore is oriented to Thr203 and His148, forming a hydrogen bond with the latter (3Yang F. Moss L.G. Phillips G.N. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1246-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 4Ormö M. Cubitt A.B. Kallio K. Gross L.A. Tsien R.Y. Remington S.J.

Our previous studies also showed the importance of the amino acids at positions 148, 203, and, interestingly, 165 for the fluorescent properties of coral GFP-like proteins (1Lukyanov K.A.

BMC Biochem. 2002; 3: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (to facilitate comparisons, we have denoted all amino acids according to their alignment with GFP). Remarkably, position 148 is clearly different between coral FPs and CPs cloned to date. The known coral FPs (about 20) contain Ser148 (Table I). Similar to GFP, the DsRed crystal structure shows that the chromophore is stabilized through position 148 (5Wall M.A. Socolich M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct.

In CPs (except asCP), position 148 is Cis or Asn (Table I), whereas asCP contains the uncommon Ala148. At the same time, asCP is an exceptional protein, capable of being in both the nonfluorescent or “chromo” state and the fluorescent state. (The chromo state indicates that the protein has a high extinction coefficient but a low quantum yield, whereas in the fluorescent state the protein is characterized by a high quantum yield.) Noticeably, a single X148S mutation makes coral CPs (including asCP) fluorescent, with the excitation/emission characteristics corresponding to their absorption peaks (1Lukyanov K.A. Fradkov A.F.

It is likely that in coral CP X148S mutants, the chromophore state is similar to that in FPs.Table IAmino acids in positions 148, 165, and 203 in Aequorea victoria GFP and Anthozoa chromoproteins and fluoroproteinsProteinChromophore148165203A. victoriaGFPSYGHFTAnthozoaChromoproteinscpasCPAYGCNLcgCPAYGCNLhcCPEYGCNIaaspCPQYGNNRgtenCPQYGNNRKindling fluorescent proteinasCPMYGASHFluorescent proteinshcriGFPRYGSDLasulGFPQYGSDLcgigGFPQYGSRLdstrGFPQYGSITDsRedQYGSISdis2RFPQYGSISrfloGFPQYGSIHdis3GFPQYGSIHclavGFPQYGSIHdendGFPHYGSIHmcavRFPHYGSIHrfloRFPHYGSVHrmueGFPQYGSVHptilGFPQYGSVHscubGFPQYGSVHscubGFPQYGSVHamajGFPKYGSVHzoanYFPKYGSVHzoanGFPNYGSVHmcavGFPDYGSVHData on fluoroproteins were derived from Labas et al.

S. A. 2002; 2: 4256-4261Crossref Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Like Ala148, Ser165 in asCP is also exceptional. Typically this position is occupied by Val or Ile in FPs or by Asn in CPs (Table I). Position 203 does not differ so definitely between coral FPs and CPs, although most FPs contain His203. We examined the kindling properties of asCP with mutations at amino acid position 148, in combination with wild-type Ser165 and mutated S165V. His203 was also mutated. TableII lists the properties of the mutant proteins. Random mutagenesis of Ala148 in asCP gave mutants with Gly, Ser, Cys, Asn and Thr148, which folded in E. coli at 37 °C. All of these mutants were intensely colored except for the poorly folded A148T. Mutants A148C and A148N lost the kindling property and stayed nonfluorescent, the A148G kept the wild-type protein properties in general (see detailed study below), and mutants A148S and A148T became fluorescent and kept the kindling property (although A148T lost the quenching property). It is reasonable to assume that changes to essential position 148 affected asCP fluorescent and kindling properties because this position is important for FPs chromophore stabilization. However, interestingly, our results demonstrated that changes in position 148 caused no significant alteration in protein coloration.Table IIasCP mutant properties Open table in a new tab It is noteworthy that the asCP-S165V mutant was fluorescent and completely lost all its kindling/quenching properties. Moreover, this mutation made asCP fluorescent independently of position 148. Thus, asCP mutant S165V with mutation at position 148 (A148G, A148S, A148C, or A148N) were fluorescent and incapable of quenching or additional kindling (A148T/S165V mutant folding was poor). At the same time, all S165V mutants were relatively weakly colored compared with wild-type asCP and A148X mutants. Mutation of His203 also influenced asCP kindling. The asCP-A148S/H203S mutant was fluorescent with an emission maximum at 590 nm and, in contrast to the A148S mutant, was incapable of kindling or quenching. Two plausible explanations can be proposed for a protein switching from a chromo to fluorescent form: either a change in chromophore charge or a change in chromophore environment. Neutral and anionic forms of the GFP chromophore have clearly different excitation spectra, peaking at 396 and 476 nm, respectively, but have close emission maxima at 508 and 503 nm (9Heim R. Prasher D.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 20: 12501-12504Crossref Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). A simultaneous decrease of the 396 nm and increase of the 476 nm excitation peaks was observed in the course of irreversible GFP photoactivation (10Yokoe H. Meyer T. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1252-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 11Patterson G.H. Lippincott-Schwartz J.A. Science. 2002; 13: 1873-1877Crossref Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). However, the excitation maximum wavelength of the kindled asCP was very close to its absorption maximum before kindling (Fig. 1 A). This argues for the same chromophore charge of both initial nonfluorescent and kindled fluorescent asCP, suggesting that some other changes put the chromophore into a new state. The influence of temperature on kindled asCP relaxation time (see above) indicates that protein conformation changes are involved. On the basis of our findings, we propose a model whereby kindling is related to cis-trans isomerization (or turning) of the excited chromophore from a chromo to a fluorescent state. As Ser148, characteristic of coral FPs, makes asCP fluorescent, we presume that the asCP chromophore fluorescent (kindled) state is similar to the fluorescent state of coral FPs and GFP. Therefore, if kindling is tied with the chromophore cis-trans isomerization, asCP Tyr66 should contact Ser165before kindling. (The latter follows from the DsRed crystal map. In DsRed, Ile165 spatially blocks this conformation (Fig.2 A).) Therefore, we suggest that the exceptional wild-type Ser165 in asCP stabilizes the chromophore in the chromo state. However, the excited chromophore has a chance to isomerize to the fluorescent state, close to that of GFP and DsRed (Fig. 2, B and C). Notably, the S165V change makes asCP fluorescent. This mutant loses all of the kindling/quenching properties of the wild-type protein, suggesting that the chromo state is blocked by Val165. As in GFP Thr203 is known to take part in chromophore stabilization, and asCP contains His203, which is present in most coral FPs, it is possible that His203 takes part in the temporary asCP chromophore stabilization in the kindled state. The proposed model correlates well with asCP mutants properties (see TableII). For example, previously mentioned asCP-A148S mutant is fluorescent and is capable of additional kindling in green light and quenching in blue light. Within several minutes after kindling or quenching irradiation is stopped, the protein is restored to its initial fluorescent brightness. Within the proposed model, these properties of the A148S mutant may be explained as such; Ser148 functions to stabilize the chromophore in the fluorescent state as it does in coral FPs. Nevertheless, some portion of the chromophore rests stabilized by Ser165 in the chromo state, making the protein capable of additional kindling. In turn, the fluorescent chromophore fraction may be quenched, as the chromo state is not prohibited. Mutants asCP-A148C and A148N (both variants are typical for coral CPs) lose kindling ability and stay nonfluorescent, although intensely colored, with an absorption maximum close to wild-type asCP. The A148C or A148N mutation probably makes the fluorescent state noncompetitive, so that no fluorescence or kindling is observed. However, mutants asCP-A148C/S165V and asCP-A148N/S165V were fluorescent and incapable of kindling or quenching, indicating that all chromophores were in the fluorescent state, which was noncompetitive in the presence of Ser165. Remarkably, cis-trans chromophore photoisomerization was proposed earlier to explain GFP switching from the fluorescent to the long-lived “dark” state. Quantum chemical calculations showed a high probability of excited GFP chromophore cis-trans isomerization (12Weber W. Helms V. McCammon J.A. Langhoff P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 25: 6177-6182Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Extending our model, we may also surmise that two chromophore conformations are common for the chromo, fluorescent, and kindling GFP-like proteins. We have summarized this hypothesis in TableIII, taking the initial GFP chromophore state as cis and the dark state as trans.Table IIIPossible chromophore conformations in GFP-like proteinsProtein(s)Chromophore positioning “cis”Chromophore positioning “trans”GFPInitial state, fluorescentDark state, nonfluorescentKnown coral FPsInitial state, fluorescentKnown coral CPsInitial state, chromo, nonfluorescentasCPKindled state, fluorescentInitial state, chromo, nonfluorescent Open table in a new tab The A148G mutant behaved similar to wild-type asCP, with very low initial fluorescence and an ability to kindle in green light and quench in blue light. However, the kindled state half-life of the A148G mutant was 50 s, which is severalfold longer than the wild-type protein. We used the A148G mutant, the closest to wild-type asCP, as a model because its prolonged kindled state half-life allowed us to measure and compare the absorption spectra before and after reversible kindling. We found that absorption at 568 nm fell considerably in the course of A148G kindling (Fig. 3 A), and simultaneous absorption growth at 445 nm was observed (Fig.1 B). (We observed the same effect on the wild-type protein, but the fast relaxation hampered accurate measurement.) The fluorescence excitation maximum of kindled A148G and asCP was 575 nm, making it evident that the kindled chromophore still absorbs at this wavelength. Therefore, we suggest that there are at least two equilibrium forms of the kindled chromophore. The first is fluorescent, with the excitation peaked at 575 nm, whereas the second absorbs at 445 nm and is nonfluorescent. It is likely that Tyr66 is protonated in this second state, as a close absorption maximum (430 nm) was registered for acid-denatured asCP (13Martynov V.I. Savitsky A.P. Martynova N.Y. Savitsky P.A. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21012-21016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is also very likely that this equilibrium state is responsible for kindled protein quenching, which happens upon blue light irradiation. We determined the action spectrum for the quenching using asCP-A148G mutant by measuring the decrease of its weak initial fluorescence upon different wavelength light irradiation (Fig. 1 C). The quenching wavelength optimum was shown to be close to the absorption peak, which appears after asCP-A148G kindling. To confirm the crucial role of positions 165, 148, and 203 in kindling and to obtain novel kindling variants, we made several point mutations in two other coral chromoproteins, hcCP (fromHeteractis crispa (7Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 19: 16-20Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar)) and cgCP (from Condilactis gigantea (7Gurskaya N.G. Fradkov A.F. Terskikh A. Matz M.V. Labas Y.A. Martynov V.I. Yanushevich Y.G. Lukyanov K.A. Lukyanov S.A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 19: 16-20Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar)). As a result, we managed to transfer the kindling property to both proteins and also identified a novel type of kindling upon blue light irradiation. Wild-type cgCP contains Cys148, Asn165, and Leu203. A single C148S mutation made this protein fluorescent with an emission maximum at 620 nm, also making it capable of additional kindling in green light. The cgCP-C148S plus N165S mutant was weakly fluorescent and could be brightly kindled in green light, similar to asCP. For hcCP we started with a mutant containing a number of folding substitutions (A5S, T39A, L181H, P208L, K211E), because wild-type protein folding is very poor in E. coli at 37 °C. We made several changes of Cys148, Asn165, and Ile203. Among the mutants obtained, hcCP-C148S/N165S/I203H and hcCP-C148A/N165G/I203H clearly showed the kindling property. Both of these proteins were weakly fluorescent and could be brightly kindled in green light. The only mutant protein obtained on the basis of hcCP and cgCP that demonstrated quenching under blue light was the cgCP and hcCP hybrid protein: cgCP-C148S before Ser165 and hcCP after Ser165. This mutant protein was fluorescent and could be additionally kindled in green light and considerably quenched in blue light, similar to the asCP-A148S mutant. A novel type of kindling was found in two hcCP mutants containing a single change at position 165, N165A and N165G (with no additional random mutations). These nonfluorescent proteins kindled quickly upon blue light irradiation. In the kindled form they were fluorescent with an emission peak at 620 nm and excitation at 590 nm. The hcCP-N165A mutant fluorescence was observed for about 1 min after kindling, whereas the N165G mutant was fluorescent for 10 s. In contrast to other kindling variants, the kindling wavelength of these mutants was different than the fluorescent excitation wavelength, giving advantages for biotechnology applications, as there is no background kindling in the course of object tracking. Also, dual red fluorescent labeling becomes possible (Fig. 3 B). Surprisingly, for most mutant kindling proteins (but not for wild-type asCP) the irradiation with kindling light of greater intensity caused irreversible kindling. For example, irreversibly kindled A148G mutant gave stable red fluorescence with an intensity up to 40 times brighter than the unkindled protein, reaching about 50% of reversibly kindled protein brightness. The fluorescence of the irreversibly kindled A148G mutant protein did not fade for at least a year after kindling. Further studies are needed to understand the nature of this irreversible effect. The kindling effect was relatively easy to transfer to nonkindling, nonfluorescent, GFP-like Anthozoa chromoproteins. This was achieved by performing amino acid substitutions at positions 148, 165, and 203 around chromophore Tyr66, confirming the key role of these positions in kindling. asCP Ala148 and Ser165 positions mutagenesis gave proteins with essentially modified or blocked kindling and quenching. The properties of these mutants enabled us to propose a model that implies that asCP kindling is linked to chromophore cis-trans isomerization. Although Ser165 takes part in chromophore stabilization in the initial chromo state, His203 takes part in kindled chromophore temporary stabilization in the fluorescent (kindled) state, which is similar to the fluorescent chromophore state in GFP and DsRed."

This study provides evidence for the feasibility of altering substrate specificity in a metal/H+ antiporter, an important family of transporters found in a variety of organisms. The differential partitioning of cations is crucial for life processes, and transporters play a critical role in maintaining the proper concentrations of these ions in various cellular compartments (1Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33388-33394Google Scholar). The inability of plants to actively avoid toxic concentrations of particular cations in the environment places a particular importance on cation transporters. One mechanism employed by plants and fungi to avoid cation toxicity is the sequestration of cations into large vacuoles (2Marty F. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 587-599Google Scholar). A fundamental question that arises is whether there are separate vacuolar transporters for each cation, and if not, what is the metal specificity of a given transporter? Several types of active transport mechanisms exist in plants to drive cations out of the cytosol against a steep concentration gradient (3Williams L.E. Pittman J.K. Hall J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 104-126Google Scholar,4Hall J.L. J. Exp. Bot. 2002; 53: 1-11Google Scholar). One important class of transporters is the H+-coupled cation antiporters, which have been identified at the vacuolar (tonoplast) membrane and are driven by a proton electrochemical gradient (5Schumaker K.S. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 6Salt D.E. Wagner G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12297-12302Google Scholar, 7Amalou Z. Gibrat R. Trouslot P. Dauzac J.

These transporters have numerous functions including resetting cytosolic levels of Ca2+ post signaling, vacuolar sequestration of potentially toxic concentrations of Cd2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ and other metals, and vacuolar storage of essential micronutrients such as Zn2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+. Despite numerous descriptive reports in whole plants (6Salt D.E. Wagner G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12297-12302Google Scholar, 9Gonzalez A. Koren'kov V. Wagner G.J. Physiol.

Plant Physiol. 1985; 79: 1111-1117Google Scholar, 15Blumwald E. Poole R.J. Plant Physiol. 1986; 80: 727-731Google Scholar). In similar experiments in yeast, CAX2 appears to have a higher K m for Ca2+ than CAX1 and a lower capacity for Ca2+ transport (11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar). CAX2 localizes to the plant vacuole, and when expressed at high levels in transgenic plants, increases vacuolar metal transport and causes the plants to accumulate more Ca2+, Mn2+ and Cd2+(16Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-133Google Scholar). Furthermore these transgenic plants were more tolerant to Mn2+ in the growth media. These transport properties of CAX2 suggest the potential for broad substrate specificity among the 11 CAX-like transporters found in the Arabidopsis genome (17Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.-L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 126: 1646-1667Google Scholar). Two domains have been described that modulate CAX1 activity (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar, 18Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar,19Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). The first domain has been termed the Ca2+ domain (CaD), located between amino acids 87 and 95 in CAX1 (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). This domain appears to be necessary for Ca2+ transport by CAX1. Exchanging this 9-amino acid region of CAX1 into CAX2 (giving the construct CAX2–9) greatly increases its Ca2+ transport activity but does not appear to alter transport of other metals (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). The second domain that regulates CAX function has been termed the regulatory or autoinhibitory domain (18Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Google Scholar, 19Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Hirschi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26452-26459Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that an N-terminal regulatory domain may be present in all plant CAX-like transporters (20Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Google Scholar). The CAX1 and CAX2 open reading frames contain additional amino acids at the N terminus that were not found in the original “shorter” N-terminally truncated CAX (sCAX) clones (sCAX1 and sCAX2) identified by suppression of yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport mutants (20Pittman J.K.

Plant Biol. 2002; 4: 612-618Google Scholar). These findings suggest structural features involved in regulation and Ca2+transport but do not identify domains that may confer metal specificity among these CAX transporters. The manipulation of CAX transporters, through alteration in expression and substrate specificity, is an essential component in developing plants with increased tolerance to metals or removing toxic levels of metals from soil (phytoremediation) (22Salt D.E. Smith R.D. Raskin I. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 643-668Google Scholar). For a successful phytoremediation strategy, it is important to understand what determines the specificity of broad range metal transporters such as CAX2. In this report, we have characterized the transport properties of the CAX2 transporter. We identify specific domains within CAX2 that mediate Mn2+ substrate specificity and alter these domains to abolish the Mn2+ transport capabilities of CAX2, thus increasing its metal specificity. These findings serve as a framework for engineering metal specificity among the various H+/cation exchangers found in bacteria, fungi, and plants. K667 (cnb1::LEU2 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ (23Cunningham K.W.

Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). All of the CAX1 and CAX2 clones used in this study were identical to the N-terminally truncated clones originally identified (11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar). Thus the proteins encoded by sCAX1 andsCAX2 lacked the first 36 and 42 amino acids, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by a Class IIS restriction enzyme-mediated method (27Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 118-120Google Scholar), usingsCAX2 in pBluescript as the template DNA. BsmBI was the Class IIS restriction enzyme used throughout this study.CAX2–9 was constructed previously (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar).

The bold letters in the primer sequences indicate introduced mutations. All constructs were sequenced completely and then subcloned into the yeast expression vector piHGpd. CAX1-c-Myc was constructed in a previous study (20Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Google Scholar). Five tandem copies of the c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL) were used to produce in-frame fusions of c-Myc to the C-terminal end of CAX2 constructs. The c-mycsequence was amplified by PCR from plasmid pT7–5Xmyc using the primers 5′-GAA TTC GGA TCC GGT CGA CGG TAT CG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAA TTC GAG CTC TTA TCC ACC AAC CCG GGG TAC CGA ATT C-3′ (reverse). A BamHI site (underlined) was included in the forward primer to ligate the tag to the engineered BamHI site at the 3′-end of the CAX2 constructs. Total protein was isolated from yeast expressing c-Myc-tagged constructs using the glass bead method (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley Interscience, New York1998Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Richmond, CA) as described (20Pittman J.K. Sreevidya C.S. Shigaki T. Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 130: 1054-1062Google Scholar). The assay for Ca2+tolerance on solid agar media was performed as previously described (11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar). K667 cultures expressing various constructs were grown in a selective liquid medium for 16 h, and 4 μl were spotted onto yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) agar media containing appropriate concentrations of CaCl2 or MnCl2. The cultures were then allowed to grow for 48 h at 30 °C. Yeast membrane microsomes were prepared as described previously (28Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Cunningham K.W. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3090-3098Google Scholar). For the measurement of Ca2+ and Mn2+ uptake, membrane vesicles (30–40 μg/ml) were incubated in buffer containing 0.3 msorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES (pH 7.6), 25 mm KCl, 0.1 mm sodium azide, and 0.2 mm sodium orthovanadate. Vacuolar H+-translocating ATPase-catalyzed H+ translocation was initiated by the addition of 1 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm ATP. The vesicles were allowed to reach steady state with respect to pH gradient for 5 min at 25 °C before the addition of 45Ca2+(6 mCi/ml; American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) or54Mn2+ (6.5 mCi/ml; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The final concentration of Ca2+ and Mn2+ in the reaction mixture was 10 μm and 1 mm, respectively. At the indicated times, aliquots (70 μl) of the reaction mix were removed and filtered through premoistened 0.45-μm pore size cellulose acetate GS-type filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After a 1-ml wash with ice-cold wash buffer (0.3 msorbitol, 5 mm Tris-MES, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm CaCl2 or MnCl2 as appropriate), the filters were air-dried, and radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. For metal competition experiments, ΔpH-dependent 10 μm45Ca2+ uptake was measured at a 10-min time point in the presence of 100 μm or 1 mm nonradioactive metals. Yeast strains lacking functional calcineurin (for example cnb strains) display increased Mn2+ sensitivity due, in part, to decreased activity of the Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase PMR1 (23Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar, 29Farcasanu I.C. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Nishiyama F. Miyakawa T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 712-717Google Scholar, 30Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Google Scholar). Furthermore, the additional lack of the vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporter VCX1 (cnb vcx1strains) slightly exacerbates the Mn2+ sensitivity of calcineurin mutants (30Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Google Scholar), indicating that VCX1 may transport Mn2+ in addition to Ca2+. Yeast mutants deleted in VCX1 and the vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase PMC1 are sensitive to high concentrations of Ca2+ in the media (23Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Google Scholar). Expression of VCX1 and N-terminally truncated CAX2 can suppress both the Mn2+ and Ca2+ sensitivity of a yeast mutant (K667, pmc1 vcx1 cnb1) defective in calcineurin and the vacuolar Ca2+ transporters (16Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-133Google Scholar). As shown previously, N-terminal truncations of CAX1 can strongly suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of these strains, whereas N-terminal truncations of CAX4 only weakly suppress the Ca2+phenotype, and N-terminal truncations of CAX3 are unable to suppress the Ca2+ phenotype (11Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Google Scholar, 31Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Google Scholar, 32Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Google Scholar). We were interested in testing whether these characterized CAX transporters could suppress the Mn2+ sensitivity of this yeast strain. As shown in Fig.1, these CAX transporters cannot suppress the Mn2+ sensitivity phenotype of the yeast mutant. Additionally, the mung bean Ca2+/H+ antiporter, VCAX1 (28Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Tsuchiya T. Sasaki M. Nakanishi Y. Cunningham K.W. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3090-3098Google Scholar), could not suppress Mn2+ sensitivity (data not shown). Only N-terminally truncated CAX2-expressing yeast mutants were capable of growing on plates containing 10 mmMnCl2 (Fig. 1). Utilizing chimeric CAX constructs in which parts of the CAX1 and CAX3 transporters were exchanged, a 9-amino acid region between putative transmembrane domains (TMD) 1 and 2 of CAX1 has been identified as important in mediating Ca2+/H+ transport (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). We have termed this domain the CaD. Swapping of the equivalent 9 amino acids of CAX3 into CAX1 abolished CAX1-mediated Ca2+/H+ transport. Alternatively, swapping of the CAX1 CaD into CAX3 allowed this chimeric CAX transporter to transport Ca2+ (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). As CAX2 is the only plant CAX transporter characterized to date with the ability to suppress the Mn2+ sensitivity of calcineurin-deficient yeast mutants (Fig. 1), a similar series of chimeric CAX constructs utilizing CAX2 should delineate the Mn2+ specificity domain(s) of this transporter. We chose to make chimeric constructs between CAX1 and CAX2 because each construct should maintain the ability to transport Ca2+. Thus, the fidelity of each construct could be rapidly assessed through suppression of Ca2+ sensitivity, and we could then test for alterations in Mn2+ suppression. Initially we planned a systematic approach to identify CAX2 Mn2+ specificity domains, similar to that used to identify the CaD of CAX1 (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). We chose to divide CAX1 and CAX2 into four segments of approximately equal size and exchange each segment to create eight different chimeric constructs (33Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 736-740Google Scholar). Although the construction of the chimeric clones was successful, Ca2+antiport activity was abolished for some of the constructs, indicating that protein stability was affected (data not shown). Therefore, an alternative approach was used. At the amino acid level, CAX2 is 43% identical (56% similar) to the CAX1 open reading frame. A sequence comparison among CAX1, CAX2, CAX3, and CAX4 identified five short domains, each consisting of 9–15 amino acids, which had very low sequence similarity between CAX1 and CAX2 (Fig. 2). We have designated these domains A to E. The A domain (amino acids 65–73 of CAX1) is present at the start of TMD 1, the B domain (amino acids 150–160 of CAX1) is present between TMD 3 and 4, the C domain (amino acids 175–184 of CAX1) is present in TMD 4, the D domain (amino acids 219–233 of CAX1) is present between TMD 5 and 6, and the E domain (amino acids 257–265 of CAX1) is present between TMD 6 and the acidic motif. There is very little variation among CAX1, CAX3, CAX4, and the mung bean VCAX1 in domains A, B, C, and E, whereas domain D and the region corresponding to the CAX1 9-amino acid CaD is very divergent among all CAX sequences (Fig. 2). We created five mutants in CAX2 that contain the corresponding CAX1 A, B, C, D, or E domain. These mutants were designated CAX2-A, CAX2-B, CAX2-C, CAX2-D, and CAX2-E, respectively. For these studies we have also used the previously constructed CAX2–9 construct, which contains the CAX1 9-amino acid CaD (14Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Google Scholar). All of the mutants were N-terminally truncated, i.e. constructed without the first 42 amino acids of CAX2. Because we had previously found that some CAX1/CAX2 chimeric clones had altered protein stability, it was very important to verify that each construct was expressed at approximately equal levels in yeast, and so we tagged each chimeric construct with a C-terminal c-Myc epitope and analyzed protein expression (Fig. 3). Each chimera was expressed similarly to CAX1 and CAX2.Figure 3Expression levels of CAX1, CAX2, and CAX2 chimeric constructs. Western blot showing relative expression levels of various constructs with C-terminal c-Myc tags used in the tolerance assay. Equal amounts of total protein isolated from yeast strains expressing each c-Myc-tagged construct as indicated were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and then subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As we anticipated, each of these constructs could suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the yeast mutants relatively equally when grown on 200 mmCaCl2 (Fig. 4). However, when the yeast strains expressing these constructs were grown on higher levels of Ca2+ (250 mm CaCl2), we observed growth differences. Although the CAX2-C-, CAX2-D-, CAX2-E-, and CAX2–9-expressing strains grew in a manner similar to CAX2 strains, the CAX2-A- and CAX2-B-expressing strains were significantly reduced in their growth under these media conditions (Fig. 4). In media containing 10 mm MnCl2, yeast strains harboring the CAX2, CAX2–9, CAX2-D, and CAX2-E constructs all grew (Fig.5). Like strains expressing CAX1, those expressing CAX2-A, CAX2-B, and CAX2-C completely failed to suppress Mn2+ sensitivity. Even at lower MnCl2concentrations (5 mm), the CAX2-A, CAX2-B, and CAX2-C strains were unable to grow (Fig. 5).Figure 5Identification of domains in CAX2 that are necessary for conferring Mn2+ tolerance in yeast. Suppression of Mn2+ sensitivity of thepmc1 vcx1 cnb yeast mutant, K667, by various CAX constructs. The same assay conditions were used as described in the legend for Fig.1, except yeast growth is shown on YPD containing 5 mm and 10 mm MnCl2. A representative experiment is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the Ca2+ transport properties of these three Mn2+-negative mutants directly, ΔpH-dependent 10 μm45Ca2+ uptake into yeast membrane vesicles was measured (Fig.6 A). Ca2+ antiport activity mediated by CAX2-A and CAX2-B was significantly lower than for CAX2 (57.4 and 33.4% of CAX2 activity, respectively), whereas Ca2+ antiport activity mediated by CAX2-C was not significantly different from CAX2. The ability to suppress the Mn2+ sensitivity of the yeast mutants infers Mn2+ transport capability. However, it is important to demonstrate directly that these CAX2 constructs mediate Mn2+/H+ antiport activity in yeast. Therefore, we measured ΔpH-dependent 1 mm54MnCl2 uptake into microsomal vesicles isolated from K667 yeast strains expressing various CAX transporters. Mn2+/H+ transport activity was observed in membrane vesicles from CAX2- and CAX2-E-expressing strains (Fig.6 B), but no Mn2+/H+ antiport activity was detectable in vesicles from CAX1- or CAX2-C-expressing yeast (data not shown). The Mn2+/H+ antiport activity measured from CAX2-E vesicles was modestly greater than the activity of CAX2 (Fig. 6 B), confirming the slight increase in yeast growth of CAX2-E strains compared with CAX2 strains on high Mn2+ media (Fig. 5). The CAX2-C-expressing strains have a specific defect in Mn2+ tolerance, as the growth of these strains is largely indistinguishable from CAX2- on Ca2+-containing media (Fig. 4) despite the lack of growth on Mn2+-containing media (Fig. 5). The inability of the CAX2-A- and CAX2-B-expressing strains to suppress Mn2+sensitivity also implicates these domains as being involved in Mn2+ transport (Fig. 5). However, CAX2-A- and CAX2-B-expressing strains also exhibited diminished growth on Ca2+-containing media and decreased Ca2+/H+ antiport activity (Figs. 4 and6 A), suggesting a nonspecific reduction in transport capabilities. To examine which amino acids were involved in determining the Mn2+ specificity of CAX2-C, we divided the CAX2 C domain into two regions, each containing 3 different amino acids than those present in the CAX1 C domain. The CAX2-C1 chimera contains the 3 amino acids TSL from CAX1, replacing amino acids CAF of CAX2, and the CAX2-C2 construct contains the 3 amino acids IAN from CAX1, replacing the amino acids LVF of CAX2 (Fig. 2). Yeast strains expressing the CAX2-C2 construct were indistinguishable from CAX2, as these strains could suppress both the Ca2+ and Mn2+sensitivity of K667 yeast (Fig.7 A). Yeast strains expressing CAX2-C1 were able to strongly suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity phenotype, but there was no growth of these strains on Mn2+-containing media. When the transport properties of CAX2-C1 were determined by direct ΔpH-dependent45Ca2+ and 54Mn2+uptake measurements into membrane vesicles prepared from CAX2-C1-expressing yeast, CAX2-C1 was found to have significant Ca2+/H+ antiport activity, which was indistinguishable from that of CAX2, but no Mn2+/H+ antiport activity (Fig.7 B). To further analyze the altered transport properties of the CAX2 mutants, competition experiments were performed. This approach allowed us to determine the effect of the domain swapping between CAX1 and CAX2 on cation selectivity. ΔpH-dependent 10 μm45Ca2+ uptake was measured at a single 10-min time point into yeast microsomal vesicles isolated from strains expressing CAX1, CAX2, and the six CAX2 mutants. Ca2+ uptake determined in the absence of excess nonradioactive metal (control) was compared with Ca2+uptake determined in the presence of two concentrations (10× and 100×) of various nonradioactive metals (Fig.8). Inhibition of Ca2+ uptake by nonradioactive Ca2+ was used as an internal control, and as expected, Ca2+ uptake by each CAX transporter was strongly inhibited by excess Ca2+. Nonradioactive Ca2+, particularly the 10× concentrations, did not completely inhibit Ca2+ uptake, further highlighting the low Ca2+ affinity of the CAX transporters. We have previously demonstrated that tobacco plants ectopically expressing CAX2 have significantly increased vacuolar transport of Cd2+(16Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-133Google Scholar). Ca2+ uptake by CAX1 and CAX2 were both strongly inhibited by Cd2+, and this Cd2+ inhibition was consistently observed in all of the six CAX2 mutants.

https://openalex.org/W1975584470,"BAR is a nuclear bile acid receptor (BAR) (FXR) receptor that regulates gene networks involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis. We have identified two classes of synthetic compounds that differentially modulate BAR activity. The first class activates BAR target genes in the predicted fashion and is 25-fold more potent than endogenous bile acids. The second class, represented by AGN34, antagonizes BAR in transient reporter assays. Surprisingly, this compound acts in a gene-selective manner in vivo: it is an agonist on CYP7A1, an antagonist on IBABP , and is neutral on SHP. These findings indicate that synthetic BAR modulators can be developed to regulate transcription in a gene-specific fashion. Given the ability of BAR to regulate several lipid homeostatic pathways, the identification of gene-selective BAR modulators have important implications for the development of improved cholesterol lowering agents.

It is also as an essential precursor in the synthesis of transcriptionally active lipids including the steroid hormones and oxysterols (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3002) Google Scholar). Although essential, cholesterol is highly insoluble and can form deposits that contribute to a variety of diseases including gallstones and heart disease (2Dowling R.H. Aliment Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14 Suppl. 2: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 3Jones P.H. Am. J. Manag. Care. 2001; 7: S289-S298PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, excess circulating cholesterol is a major risk for atherosclerotic heart disease (3Jones P.H. Am. J. Manag. Care. 2001; 7: S289-S298PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kaul D. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2001; 219: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This disease is responsible for nearly 500,000 deaths each year in the United States (42American Heart Association 1999 Heart and Stroke Statistical Update. The American Heart Association, Dallas, TX1999Google Scholar) and is the single largest cause of mortality in industrialized nations. It has been estimated that 10% of the U.S. population would benefit from cholesterol-lowering therapies (5Fedder D.O. Koro C.E. L'Italien G.J. Circulation. 2002; 105: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This has prompted an intense search for therapeutic agents that specifically modulate cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol levels are controlled at a variety of levels including intestinal uptake, endogenous biosynthesis, transport, and elimination. The major pathway for cholesterol elimination is via hepatic conversion of cholesterol into water-soluble bile acids (6Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-D193Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) and their subsequent secretion into the gastrointestinal tract. Approximately 95% of the secreted bile acids are recycled via intestinal uptake and are returned to the liver through the portal blood. The remaining 5% of bile acids are eliminated from the gut thereby forcing the liver to replenish these losses by converting as much as 0.5 g of cholesterol to bile acids each day (7Russell D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 539-542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The liver therefore has an enormous capacity to metabolize cholesterol and therapies that target this process have the potential to eliminate cholesterol derived from a variety of sources including diet, synthesis, and atherosclerotic lesions (via the reverse cholesterol transport pathway). Two metabolic pathways have been identified that convert cholesterol to bile acids (6Chiang J.Y.L. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D176-D193Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In humans, the classic pathway is responsible for at least 90% of all bile acid synthesis. The first and rate-limiting step in this pathway is catalyzed by CYP7A1,1 a liver-specific cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. CYP7A1 transcription is strongly repressed by its bile acid end products (8Myant N.B. Mitropoulos K.A. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 135-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An important advance in understanding this feedback loop came with the identification of a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (FXR, NR1H4, hereafter referred to as BAR) that suppresses CYP7A1transcription in response to endogenous bile acids (9Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 10Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M.

Lambert G. Gonzalez F.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). Two bile acid response elements (BAREs) have been identified in theCYP7A1 promoter. However, BAR is unable to bind directly to either element, suggesting an indirect role for BAR in the regulation of CYP7A1 (13Chiang J.Y. Kimmel R. Weinberger C. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10918-10924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). A mechanism has been proposed whereby BAR induces the negative transcriptional regulator SHP (small heterodimer partner), which in turn represses transcription factors that bind to the CYP7A1 BAREs (14Lu T.T.

Although the mechanisms underlying transrepression by BAR is unclear, it is well known that BAR activates transcription by binding to specific response elements (19Forman B.M. Goode E. Chen J.

Several genes have been identified whose transcription is activated by BAR including SHP, the ileal bile acid-binding protein (IBABP), and the hepatic bile salt export pump (BSEP, ABCB11) (21Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These genes are critical for bile acid homeostasis. IBABP is an intracellular protein expressed in the distal ileum where the majority of bile acids are reabsorbed. It has been proposed that IBABP plays a role in transcellular shuttling and/or buffering the high and otherwise toxic levels of bile acids that pass through this tissue. BSEP is a canalicular ATP binding cassette transporter that is responsible for biliary secretion of bile acids. Indeed, inactivating mutations of this gene result in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (type 2) and hepatic cirrhosis (22Strautnieks S.S. Bull L.N. Knisely A.S. Kocoshis S.A. Dahl N. Arnell H. Sokal E. Dahan K. Childs S. Ling V. Tanner M.S. Kagalwalla A.F. Nemeth A. Pawlowska J. Baker A. Mieli-Vergani G. Freimer N.B. Gardiner R.M. Thompson R.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to regulating cholesterol degradation, BAR plays a more general role in coordinately regulating bile acid physiology. BAR also controls other aspects of lipid homeostasis. For example, BAR agonists reduce triglyceride levels (23Iser J.H. Sali A. Drugs. 1981; 21: 90-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 24Maloney P.R. Parks D.J. Haffner C.D. Fivush A.M.

Cell. 2000; 102: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). This is potentially related to BAR-mediated regulation of apolipoprotein CII and/or phospholipid transfer protein (reviewed in Ref. 21Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, it appears that BAR activation promotes reciprocal effects on cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Given its critical role in repressing CYP7A1-mediated cholesterol degradation, BAR provides an attractive target for the development of novel cholesterol lowering agents. However, the effects of BAR on other target genes implies that a generalized antagonist would produce undesirable effects including elevations in triglycerides, a lowering of biliary bile acid transport, and/or cholestasis. Therefore, the most desirable therapeutic agents would be gene-selective modulators that selectively regulate a subset of BAR-specific genes. In a search for such compounds we have identified two classes of BAR modulators. The first class include agonists that are ∼25-fold more potent than naturally occurring bile acids. These compounds activate BAR and produce the expected regulation pattern on endogenous target genes. Second, we have identified AGN34 as a gene-selective BARmodulator (BARM): it acts as an agonist on CYP7A1, an antagonist on IBABP , and is neutral on SHP. These data demonstrate thatSHP induction is not required to repress CYP7A1. More significantly, we provide evidence for gene-selective BARMs, a finding with important implications for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease.

The data presented were obtained with mouse BAR but human and rat BAR exhibited qualitatively similar results. HepG2 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mmsodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and nonessential amino acids. Caco-2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum. Caco-2 cells were maintained for 20 days post-confluence to allow differentiation. One day prior to treatment, confluent HepG2 and differentiated Caco-2 cells were switched to phenol red-free media containing resin-charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and treated for an additional 24 h with the indicated compounds. Northern blots were prepared from poly(A)+ RNA and analyzed with the following probes: human CYP7A1 nucleotides 1617–2576 (accession number M93133), human SHP nucleotides 888–1355 (accession number L76571), human IBABP coding sequence (accession number AI311734), and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) nucleotides 105–331 (accession number NM_002046). The RNA levels were quantitated using a GS-800 calibrated densitometer and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). This assay was performed as previously described (9Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C.

An optimized DR-1 was used for RXR homodimers and the mouse IBABP IR-1 response element (10Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar) was used for BAR·RXR heterodimers. The data presented were obtained with rat BAR. RXRα proteins were produced using a baculovirus expression system and binding assays were performed as described previously (28Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A.

To begin to identify BAR-specific modulators, we noted that the synthetic retinoid TTNPB ((E)-4-(2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)propen-1-yl)benzoic acid) (Fig. 1 A) binds to and activates BAR (11Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M.

A. 1997; 94: 7909-7914Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A major limitation in the use of TTNPB as a BAR agonist is that TTNPB is a 1000-fold higher affinity ligand for the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (30Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Badea B.A. White S.K. Mais D.E. Berger E. Suto C.M. Goldman M.E. Heyman R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2930-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to identify TTNPB derivatives that lack activity on RAR. Analysis of the crystal structure of retinoid-bound RAR indicates that the methyl group in the central isoprene unit (Fig. 1 A,TTNPB, shaded area) interacts with critical residues in helix 5 of the RAR ligand binding domain (31Klaholz B.P. Mitschler A. Belema M. Zusi C. Moras D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that placement of bulky residues in this position would create a steric hindrance to RAR binding. At the same time, compounds with a bulky moiety in this location might retain activity on BAR as this structure would more closely approximate the cyclohexane ring at the corresponding position of the BAR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (Fig. 1 A). To test this hypothesis, AGN29 and AGN31 were synthesized with trimethylsilyl and n-butyl groups in place of the methyl moiety on the central isoprene unit of TTNPB (Fig.1 A, shaded area). At concentrations of 5 μm, AGN29 (91-fold) and AGN31 (85-fold) were potent and efficacious activators of the BAR·RXR heterodimer (Fig.1 B). By comparison, TTNPB was less efficacious in activating BAR (65-fold) and CDCA, an endogenous BAR ligand, required 20-fold higher concentrations (100 μm) for optimal activity (Fig.1 B). As predicted, AGN29 and AGN31 were both dramatically less effective than TTNPB in activating RAR (Fig. 1 C) and had no effect on other nuclear receptors including AR, mouse, and human PXR, ERα, CAR, LXRα, PPARα, PPARγ, PPARδ, VDR, and T3Rβ (data not shown). Thus, unlike the parent ligand TTNPB, AGN29 and AGN31 exhibit significant selectivity for BAR. RXR-specific ligands such as LG268 are known to activate the BAR·RXR heterodimer (Fig. 1 B), however, we have previously established that this occurs via the RXR subunit and not via BAR (9Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). Because TTNPB derivatives were originally used to identify RXR-specific ligands (30Boehm M.F. Zhang L. Badea B.A. White S.K. Mais D.E. Berger E. Suto C.M. Goldman M.E. Heyman R.A. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 2930-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of AGN29 and AGN31 to activate RXR. Both compounds activated RXR at the same concentrations required to activate BAR·RXR heterodimers (5 μm) and were inactive at lower doses (data not shown). Although AGN29 and AGN31 activate RXR, their action is distinct from that of LG268. For example, when compared with LG268, AGN29 and AGN31 preferentially activate BAR·RXR heterodimers whereas LG268 preferentially activates RXR (compare Fig.1, B and D). To further explore the molecular properties of AGN29 and AGN31 we examined their effects on coactivator recruitment in vitro. The primary function of nuclear receptor ligands is to induce a conformation change that facilitates recruitment of transcriptional coactivator proteins via the AF2 transactivation domain (32Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36865-36868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Previous coactivator recruitment assays have demonstrated that bile acids and TTNPB bind directly to BAR (9Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar, 11Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Bledsoe R.K. Chandra G. Consler T.G. Kliewer S.A. Stimmel J.B. Willson T.M. Zavacki A.M. Moore D.D. Lehmann J.M. Science. 1999; 284: 1365-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). We used an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (9Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar) to determine whether AGN29 and AGN31 also serve as BAR ligands. Thus, BAR·RXR heterodimers were formed on a32P-labeled BAR response element and incubated with a peptide containing the receptor interaction domains of the coactivator GRIP1. As expected, both AGN29 and AGN31 effectively recruited coactivator (Fig. 2 A,lanes 1–3). LG268 also recruited coactivator (Fig.2 A, lane 4) but was less effective than AGN29 and AGN31, a finding that parallels the transactivation data (Fig. 1,B and D). To explore the subunit requirements of these compounds, we asked whether the BAR or RXR AF2 was required for these interactions. Mutation of the BAR AF2 resulted in loss of activity for both AGN29 and AGN31 whereas mutation of RXR AF2 had no effect (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–7 and9–11). In contrast, recruitment by LG268 required the AF2 domain of RXR as well as BAR (Fig. 2 A, lanes 8and 12). Thus, whereas AGN29 and AGN31 can activate an isolated RXR subunit (Fig. 1 D), the results of Fig.2 A demonstrate that BAR is essential for the activity of AGN29 and AGN31 in the context of the BAR·RXR heterodimer. To determine the relative potency of AGN29 and AGN31, transfected cells were treated with increasing doses of AGN29 and AGN31 (Fig.2 B). The half-maximal effective concentrations (EC50) for AGN29 and AGN31 are ∼2 μmcompared with >50 μm for CDCA. Similarly, using the coactivator recruitment assay, AGN29 and AGN31 produced a dose-dependent increase in the GRIP1-containing complex (Fig. 2 C). The concentration of AGN29 and AGN31 that promoted GRIP recruitment closely paralleled the potency of these compounds in transfection assays (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that AGN29 and AGN31 are not only BAR ligands but are >25-fold more potent than their endogenous counterparts. BAR regulates transcription of specific target genes in the liver (CYP7A1,SHP) and intestine (IBABP, SHP) (reviewed in Ref. 21Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This prompted us to test the effect of AGN29 and AGN31 on gene expression in HepG2 hepatoma cells and in differentiated intestinal Caco-2 cells. Both cell lines were treated for 24 h with optimal concentrations of AGN29, AGN31 (10 μm), or CDCA (100 μm). Like CDCA, AGN29 and AGN31 strongly induced SHP and IBABP expression in Caco-2 cells (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, these compounds acted as agonists in HepG2 cells and produced the expected induction of SHP and repression of CYP7A1 (Fig.3 B). AGN29 and AGN31 had no effect on expression ofBAR (data not shown) or the GAPDH internal control (Fig. 3). These results demonstrate that AGN29 and AGN31 are agonists on endogenous target genes. We next explored the possibility that retinoid derivatives might serve as BAR antagonists. Indeed, using the transfection assay described above, AGN34 (Fig.4 A, 1 μm) was identified as a compound that effectively blocked transcriptional activation by the endogenous CDCA ligand (50 μm) (Fig.4 B). AGN34 had no effect on basal reporter activity (Fig.4 B). AGN34 also failed to antagonize the nuclear receptors AR, HNF4α CAR, LXR, mouse and human PXR, PPARα, PPARγ, PPARδ, and VDR and exhibited only minimal activity on ERα, T3Rβ, and RAR (Fig. 4 C). These data demonstrate that AGN34 is a selective antagonist of BAR activity. Because AGN34 possesses a partial retinoid-like structure, we examined the effect of this compound on the retinoid receptors RAR and RXR. AGN34 was a weak antagonist of RAR and other receptors that utilize RXR as an obligate heterodimeric partner (Fig. 4 C). However, AGN34 was an effective antagonist of RXR homodimers (Fig. 4 C). This prompted us to compare the activity of AGN34 on BAR·RXR and RXR complexes. Dose-response analysis demonstrated that AGN34 antagonized both receptor complexes with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of <10 nm (Fig.5, A and C). Thus, the ability to antagonize RXR and BAR at similar doses suggest that AGN34 acts to trans-antagonize bile acid-activated BAR·RXR by binding to the RXR subunit. We used an in vitro radioligand displacement assay to confirm that AGN34 acts directly on the RXR subunit. RXR was incubated with [20-methyl-3H]9-cis-retinoic acid and binding was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled AGN34. We found that AGN34 associates with RXR with a binding constant of ∼2 nm (Fig.5 B). The high in vitro affinity of AGN34 for RXR closely matches its IC50 for both RXR and BAR·RXR heterodimers. These findings confirm that AGN34 can trans-antagonize BAR·RXR via the RXR subunit. While AGN34 can function via the RXR subunit, this does not exclude the possibility that it could have additional activities via the BAR subunit. Indeed, examination of the dose-response curve for BAR·RXR (Fig. 5 A) indicates that AGN34-mediated antagonism is somewhat biphasic. Antagonism is first seen at low doses corresponding to those associated with RXR binding (≤10 nm). A plateau is seen at intermediate doses (100–1000 nm) and then a second phase of antagonism is observed at high doses (>1 μm). This pattern implies that AGN34 acts via the RXR subunit at low doses and via the BAR subunit at higher doses. To further explore the activity of AGN34 on the BAR subunit, we examined the effect of low and high dose AGN34 on agonist-induced coactivator recruitment. Whereas agonist ligands recruit coactivators to nuclear receptors, antagonists occupy the ligand binding pocket but fail to recruit coactivators (33Bourguet W. Germain P. Gronemeyer H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). When agonists and antagonists are mixed, the antagonist competes with the agonist for binding and promotes an apparent displacement of coactivator. As expected, the RXR-specific ligand LG268 induced coactivator recruitment to RXR homodimers (Fig. 5 C, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Addition of AGN34 resulted in a displacement of coactivator from RXR homodimers with an IC50 of ∼30 nm (Fig. 5 C, top panel, lanes 3–10). In contrast, low doses of AGN34 (<30 nm) resulted in only a partial displacement of coactivator from BAR (Fig.5 C, bottom panel, lanes 1–5). Full coactivator displacement and reappearance of the coactivator-free heterodimer required concentrations greater than 300 nm(Fig. 5 C, bottom panel, lanes 6–10). Similar results were seen using a mutated RXR with decreased ligand binding affinity (data not shown) suggesting that AGN34 functions via BAR at these high doses. This biphasic pattern of coactivator displacement in vitro further demonstrates that AGN34 antagonizes BAR·RXR via both subunits. The ability to trans-antagonize BAR·RXR with RXR antagonists raises the possibility that previously characterized RXR antagonists such as LG754 (34Lala D.S. Mukherjee R. Schulman I.G. Koch S.S. Dardashti L.J. Nadzan A.M. Croston G.E. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 450-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) might generally serve as BAR·RXR antagonists. However, LG754 did not effectively antagonize BAR in transfection assays (Fig.5 D) and only displaced coactivator from agonist-occupied BAR·RXR heterodimers at very high concentrations (3 μm) (Fig. 5 E). Thus unlike previous RXR antagonists, AGN34 is distinct in its ability to trans-antagonize BAR·RXR. The above data demonstrate that AGN34 is a potent and selective antagonist of BAR that functions via a unique form of trans-antagonism. This prompted us to explore the effect of this compound on a variety of endogenous BAR target genes. Differentiated Caco-2 and HepG2 cells were treated with 100 μm CDCA alone or in combination with 1 μm AGN34. In Caco-2 cells AGN34 dramatically inhibited bile acid-induced expression of IBABP (Fig.6 A), an effect that was observed with doses of AGN34 as low as 30 nm (data not shown). These results demonstrate that AGN34 is a potent antagonist of endogenous BAR target genes. To further examine the activity of AGN34, we tested its effect onSHP expression. Although SHP is induced by BAR agonists in both cell lines, the antagonist AGN34 failed"

We also describe the ligand specificity and tissue expression of GPI-HBP1. High density lipoprotein (HDL)1 plays a key role in the transportation of cholesterol to extrahepatic tissues including steroidogenic tissues and in the reverse transportation of cholesterol from extrahepatic tissues to the liver (1Krieger M.

Unlike the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway, the delivery of cholesterol from HDL to cells is mediated by selective lipid uptake from HDL particles and is independent of internalization of HDL. Reverse cholesterol transportation requires the extraction of cholesterol from extrahepatic cells by HDL and the subsequent delivery of cholesterol to hepatocytes.

We have now characterized four additional splice isoforms, two of which are novel. The six isoforms can be divided into skeletal or cardiac specific classes, based on the inclusion of skeletal or cardiac specific domains. Short and long isoforms share an N-terminal PDZ domain, but the three C-terminal LIM domains are unique to long isoforms. By RNA and protein analysis, we have demonstrated that Cypher isoforms are developmentally regulated in both skeletal and cardiac muscle. We have previously shown that knockout of Cypher is neonatal lethal. To investigate the function of splice variants in vivo, we have performed a rescue experiment of the Cypher null mutant by replacing the endogenous Cypher gene with cDNAs encoding either a short or long skeletal muscle isoform. In contrast to Cypher null mice, a percentage of mice that express only a short or a long skeletal muscle-specific isoform can survive to at least 1 year of age. Although surviving mice exhibit muscle pathology, these results suggest that either isoform is sufficient to rescue the lethality associated with the absence of Cypher.

This relative paucity of genes may be compensated for by alternative splicing to yield more protein products per gene as substantiated by bioinformatics screening, which suggests that 35–60% of human genes have at least one alternative splice form (3Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that to understand the functions of an alternatively spliced gene, it will be important to characterize and understand the diverse biological roles of its specific protein isoforms. To date, only several hundred alternatively spliced genes have been identified by molecular biological approaches. Very few of them have been characterized at a functional level (3Modrek B. Lee C.

During our previous studies of a striated muscle-specific PDZ-LIM domain protein, Cypher, we reported two splice variants that were expressed to significant levels, designated Cypher1 and Cypher2 (5Zhou Q.

The longer isoform, Cypher1, contains an amino-terminal PDZ and three C-terminal LIM domains. The shorter, Cypher2, shares only the PDZ domain (5Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol.

Cypher1 and Cypher2 interact with α-actinin 2 through their PDZ domain, whereas Cypher1 interacts with distinct protein kinase C isoforms through its LIM domains (5Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The relatively high levels of expression of each isoform and their distinct biochemical functions suggest that each may have distinct as well as overlapping biological roles. To investigate this issue further, we have undertaken a detailed characterization of Cypher isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In these studies, we have characterized four additional Cypher splice isoforms, two of them novel, to bring the total of Cypher splice isoforms in mouse to six. The six isoforms can be divided into two classes based on the inclusion of a domain that is specific to either skeletal or cardiac muscle. We have also found that these isoforms are exquisitely regulated both at RNA and protein levels during successive stages of embryonic and postnatal development. Our previous studies demonstrated that Cypher plays an essential role in striated muscle structure and function (6Zhou Q. Chu P.H. Huang C. Cheng C.F. Martone M.E. Knoll G. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mice which are homozygous null for Cypher die within 1–5 days after birth from multiple striated muscle failure with symptoms that include decreased milk intake, limb muscle weakness, and cyanosis. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that skeletal and cardiac muscle from mutant mice is severely disorganized with discontinuous/punctuate Z-discs (6Zhou Q. Chu P.H. Huang C. Cheng C.F. Martone M.E. Knoll G. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To understand the requirement for short or long Cypher isoforms in striated muscle function, we have performed a rescue experiment for Cypher null mice by genetically engineering mice that express only a short or a long skeletal muscle-specific isoform rather than the six isoforms normally expressed by the endogenous gene. Results of this analysis suggest that either isoform can partially rescue the lethality associated with the absence of Cypher. Total RNA was isolated from mouse cardiac ventricle and gastrocnemius muscle using RNAzol B (Tel-Test). 10 μg of RNA was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized with α-32P-labeled probe in QuickHyb solution as described by suggested protocols. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)1 was performed using the SuperScript kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cardiac specific probe (encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1c) was generated via PCR with primers P1 (5′-GACCCTGCTCTGGACACGAACG-3′ and P2 (5′-CCTCCTAGGAGTCCAGCACCTG-3′). The skeletal specific probe (encoding amino acids 108–187 of Cypher2s) was generated via PCR with primers P3 (5′-GTGGTAGCCAATTCTCCAGCCA-3′) and P4 (5′-GCCAGCGGAGACGCCCCACTGA-3′). The Cypher1-specific probe (encoding amino acids 296–357 of Cypher1c) was generated via PCR with P5 (5′-AGCACCCCTATTGAGCATGCTC-3′) and P6 (5′-CGGATTCTCCACGGGACTTGCG-3′). Primers P7 (5′-GGAAGATGAGGCTGATGAGTG-3′) and P8 (5′-CTGAGAGAAGCAGTCATCGGT-3′) were used to distinguish Cypher1 from Cypher3. Primers P9 (5′-TCTTACAGTGTGACTCTGACTG-3′) and P10 (5′-CACGTTGATGGCATGTGCG-3′) were used to distinguish Cypher1c from Cypher1s. Primers P11 (5′-TCAGCACCAGTAATGTCTTACA-3′) and P12 (5′-CACGTTGATGGCATGTGCTTGT-3′) were used to distinguish Cypher2c from Cypher2s. Rabbit anti-mouse Cypher polyclonal antibodies were raised against cardiac specific domain (amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1c) or the skeletal muscle-specific domain (amino acids 108–187 of Cypher1s). The domains were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Antibodies were affinity-purified on the fusion proteins linked to Hi-TrapN-hydroxysuccinimide-activated columns (AmershamBiosciences). Protein analysis was performed as previously described (5Zhou Q. Ruiz-Lozano P. Martone M.E. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19807-19813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Fresh specimens from individual muscles were snap-frozen in isopentane, precooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until further processing. Frozen sections (8 μm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and modified Gomori trichrome stains and reacted for localization of myofibrillar ATPase at pH 9.8 and 4.3 and cytochrome C oxidase activity by standard methods (10Dubowitz V. Dubowitz V. Muscle Biopsy: A Practical Approach. Bailliere Tindale, London1985: 19-40Google Scholar). A genomic cypher fragment was isolated from a mouse 129svj genomic DNA library (Stratagene) as described previously (6Zhou Q. Chu P.H. Huang C. Cheng C.F. Martone M.E. Knoll G. Shelton G.D. Evans S.

PCR-based mutagenesis was used to delete and replace a 1-kb fragment between 3 bp 5′ of the ATG start and aHindIII site within intron 1 with an XhoI site (see Fig. 5 and Ref. 6Zhou Q. Chu P.H.

Full-length cypher2s orcypher3s cDNA and a pGKneo-tk cassette were inserted into the XhoI site. The linearized construct was electroporated into R1 ES cells. G418- resistant ES clones were selected and screened for homologous recombination by Southern blotting with the probe as indicated in Fig. 4.

The 5- and 7-kb bands for Cypher2sKI (B) as well as the 5- and 8-kb bands for Cypher3sKI (C) represent wild type and targeted alleles, respectively. Detection of Cypher protein in Cypher2sKI (D) and Cypher3sKI (E) mice was analyzed by protein blot analysis. Protein was extracted from 1-month-old gestrocenomius skeletal muscle from wild type (left) and Cypher2sKI and Cypher3sKI homozygous mice (right) and analyzed with skeletal muscle-specific Cypher antibodies as well as chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We had shown previously that Cypher has two distinct splice variants, Cypher1 and Cypher2. Western blot analysis of proteins from skeletal and cardiac muscle utilizing antibody specific for Cypher1 revealed that Cypher1 in cardiac muscle was ∼6 kDa larger than Cypher1 in skeletal muscle (data not shown). Our original cypher1 cDNA clone had been obtained from a heart library. To investigate the observed size difference between cardiac and skeletal Cypher1 proteins, RT-PCR was performed with RNAs from skeletal and cardiac muscle utilizing a set of primers that would amplify the coding region of Cypher1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resulting PCR products were subcloned, and 10 clones from each striated mRNA source were sequenced. 8 of 10 clones from heart were identical to Cypher1. The other two clones were identical to Cypher1 with the exception that DNA sequences encoding amino acids 296–357 of Cypher1 were missing (see Fig.1, Cypher1c and -3c). On the other hand, 10 out of 10 clones from skeletal muscle differed from Cypher1 by the absence of DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1. In nine cases, this region of Cypher1 was replaced by DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–187 of Cypher2 (see Fig. 1, Cypher 3s), and in one case, it was replaced by DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–182 (see Fig. 1, Cypher1s). 9 of these 10 were also missing DNA sequences encoding amino acids 296–357 of Cypher1 (see Fig. 1, Cypher3s). This finding suggested that DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1 and 108–187 of Cypher2 represented cardiac and skeletal specific coding regions, respectively. To determine whether cardiac and skeletal specific domains were also present in short isoforms, we performed RT-PCR with RNAs from skeletal and cardiac muscle utilizing a set of primers that spanned the coding region of Cypher2. The PCR products were subcloned, and 10 clones from each group were sequenced. All 10 clones from skeletal muscle were identical to Cypher2. The 10 clones from heart were identical to Cypher2 except that, as for the case with the cardiac specific long isoforms, DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–187 of Cypher2 were replaced by DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1 (see Fig. 1, Cypher2c). These data confirmed that DNA sequences encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1 and DNA sequences encoding 108–187 of Cypher2 were cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific domains, respectively. We then performed Northern blot analyses utilizing cDNA probes encoding cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific domains. In concert with the RT-PCR results, the probe encoding amino acids 108–226 of Cypher1, gave a positive signal only in cardiac tissue (Fig.2 A). Conversely, the probe encoding amino acids 108–187 of Cypher2 gave a positive signal only in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 B). Following these results, we have designated Cypher isoforms as either c (cardiac) or s (skeletal muscle) (Fig. 1). We have renamed the original Cypher1 and Cypher2 as Cypher1c and Cypher2s, respectively. The isoform that is the cardiac counterpart of Cypher2s is Cypher2c. The isoform that is the skeletal muscle counterpart of Cypher1c is Cypher1s. The cardiac isoform lacking amino acids 296–357 of Cypher1c is Cypher3c. Its skeletal counterpart is Cypher3s (Fig. 1). 9 of 10 clones from skeletal muscle were Cypher3s, whereas 8 of 10 clones from cardiac tissue were Cypher1c, suggesting preferential expression of each of these in the respective striated muscle tissue. To confirm this result, Northern blot analysis was performed with a probe specific for Cypher1 isoforms. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the probe gave a strong signal in the heart, consistent with previous RT-PCR results. After prolonged exposure, a faint band for Cypher1 was detected in skeletal muscle (data not shown). We next performed Western blot analyses with antibodies raised against the cardiac specific domain or the skeletal muscle-specific domain (Fig. 1). The cardiac specific antibody detected protein in heart extracts but not skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 D). The reverse was true for the skeletal muscle-specific antibody (Fig. 2 E). These results were consistent with our RNA data. A blastp search of the NCBI data base (12Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cypher1c is equivalent to Oracle1 (13Passier R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and an ortholog of human KIAA0613; Cypher3c is equivalent to Oracle2; and Cypher2s and Cypher3s sequences correspond to ZASP and ZASP variant 3, respectively, with the exception that the mouse isoforms include a 5-amino acid exon at the C terminus of the skeletal muscle-specific domain that is missing in their human counterparts (see below and Fig. 1 for exon structure). Cypher1s and Cypher2c are novel isoforms. To understand how distinct Cypher splice isoforms are generated from the cypher gene, we obtained cypher genomic DNA by screening a BAC genomic DNA library (Resgen, Huntsville, AL), utilizing cyphercDNA as a probe. The exon-intron junctions of cypherwere determined by PCR analyses of the BAC clones with primers localized at distinct regions of cypher followed by sequencing analyses. The result is shown in Fig. 1. Cypher contains a total of 17 coding exons. Interestingly, the cardiac specific region is encoded by a single exon, exon 4, whereas the skeletal muscle-specific region of cypher is encoded by three exons, exons 5–7. However, in the skeletal isoforms, exon 7 is only included in Cypher2s and -3s and is differentially spliced out in Cypher1s. Exon 10 is the last exon of both cypher2 isoforms. Exon 11 is differentially spliced to generate Cypher1 (included) or Cypher3 (excluded) isoforms. Splice isoforms of other striated muscle genes are developmentally regulated (14Gomes A.V. Guzman G.

To investigate whether Cypher isoforms are also developmentally regulated, we performed both Northern and Western blot analyses. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from heart and skeletal muscle demonstrated that expression ofcypher2 mRNAs is dramatically up-regulated postnatally (Fig. 3, A and B). To assess mRNA expression of the longer isoforms cypher1and -3 in heart and skeletal muscle, RT-PCR analysis was carried out, utilizing a set of primers within exons 8 and 13, bracketing exon 11, which is specific to cypher1 isoforms (Fig. 1). In cardiac muscle, although expression of cypher3cis up-regulated developmentally, cypher1c is the predominant long isoform expressed throughout development into adulthood (Fig.3 C). However, in skeletal muscle, expression ofcypher1s is gradually replaced by expression ofcypher3s postnatally. Western blot analysis utilizing Cypher antibodies specific to cardiac and skeletal muscle isoforms was consistent with RNA analyses (Fig. 3, E andF). To investigate the function of short versuslong Cypher isoforms, we performed a rescue experiment by creating two mouse lines in which cDNAs encoding either Cypher2s (Cypher2sKI) or Cypher3s (Cypher3sKI) were knocked in to replace the endogenouscypher gene. Previously, to generate our Cypher knockout, we had knocked lacZ cDNA into the endogenouscypher locus. This knock-in disrupted expression of all Cypher isoforms. Additionally, expression of lacZrecapitulated expression of the endogenous cipher gene. Therefore, cypher2s or cypher3s cDNAs were inserted where the lacZ cDNA had been inserted, disrupting the endogenous cypher gene (Fig.4) (6Zhou Q. Chu P.H. Huang C. Cheng C.F. Martone M.E. Knoll G. Shelton G.D. Evans S. Chen J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Mice that were heterozygous for Cypher2sKI or Cypher3sKI had no apparent phenotype and were crossed to generate mice that were homozygous for Cypher2sKI or Cypher3sKI. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Cypher2s or Cypher3s were the only Cypher isoforms expressed in mice that were homozygous for Cypher2sKI or Cypher3sKI, respectively (Fig. 4, D and E). Genotyping of 294 mice from 35 independent Cypher2sKI heterozygous crosses at weaning (4 weeks) indicated that ∼49% of the expected number were homozygous for Cypher2sKI (TableI). Analysis of 230 mice from 32 independent Cypher3sKI heterozygous crosses at weaning indicated that ∼19% of the expected number were homozygous for Cypher3sKI. Genotyping of 58 newborns from seven independent Cypher2sKI heterozygous crosses and 66 newborns from nine independent Cypher3sKI heterozygous crosses revealed that homozygous Cypher2sKI or homozygous Cypher3sKI occurred at the expected frequency of 25%. These data indicated that ∼50% of Cypher2sKI and 80% of Cypher3sKI homozygous mice die between birth and 4 weeks of age. Since no dead animals were found after 1 week, labile homozygotes were dying within the first week following birth. Cypher null mice also die within the first week of birth, and homozygous knock-in mice that die during this time period exhibited muscle phenotypes comparable with those previously seen with Cypher null mice (data not shown).Table IViability of Cypher2sKI and Cypher3sKI homozygous miceGenotypea+/+, wild type; +/KI, heterozygous; KI/KI, homozygous.Type of CrossesNo. of CrossesAge at genotyping+/++/KIKI/KIObserved no.Expected no.Observed no.Expected no.Observed no.Expected no.Cypher2sKI354 weeks88741701473674Cypher3sKI324 weeks7657.51431151157.5Cypher2sKI7Newborn1214.530291614.5Cypher3sKI8Newborn1916.529331816.5a +/+, wild type; +/KI, heterozygous; KI/KI, homozygous. Open table in a new tab Surviving homozygous knock-in mice were growth-retarded and their weight was ∼60% that of littermate controls. Some surviving homozygous knock-in mice have been allowed to age and are now 1 year old. Histopathological and histochemical analyses were performed on fresh frozen muscle specimens from mutant and wild-type littermates from 1 month to 10 months of age. No significant age-dependent differences were observed. Representative results for skeletal muscle are shown in Fig.5. Skeletal muscle from homozygous knock-in mutants displayed cytoarchitectural abnormalities that were more marked in Cypher3sKI relative to that obtained from Cypher2sKI. Compared with wild type muscle, mutant muscle fibers exhibited a marked variation in myofiber size with numerous atrophic fibers (Fig. 5, A–C). Several mutant fibers had a lobulated appearance with subsarcolemmal invaginations highlighted by the modified Gomori trichrome stain (Fig.5, D–F). Several fibers also showed multifocal loss of the normal sarcoplasmic pattern with a clear, hyaline appearance. Reaction for myofibrillar ATPase localization at pH 4.3 demonstrated that atrophic fibers were of both fiber types (Fig. 5,G–I) with no difference in the fiber type composition compared with wild type muscle. Lobulations were also present in both fiber types. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase staining demonstrated that enzyme activity was prominent in the sarcolemmal invaginations and reduced or absent in the multifocal areas having the clear, hyaline appearance with the modified Gomori trichrome stain. This pattern of reactivity confirmed the presence of mitochondrial accumulations in subsarcolemmal areas and loss in clear areas. In cardiac muscle, fibrosis was detected in tissue from both Cypher3sKI and Cypher2sKi homozygous mutants, again with greater severity for Cypher3sKI (data not shown). We have discovered two novel isoforms of Cypher, Cypher1s, and Cypher2c. The human orthologue of Cypher has been designated as ZASP, and four splice variants have been described (17Faulkner G. Pallavicini A. Formentin E. Comelli A. Ievolella C. Trevisan S. Bortoletto G. Scannapieco P. Salamon M. Mouly V. Valle G. Lanfranchi G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Three of the human isoforms, KIAA0613, ZASP, and ZASP variant 3, are the counterparts of Cypher1c, Cypher2s, and Cypher3s, respectively. The fourth human splice isoform, ZASP variant 2, has not yet been described in mice. Cypher has also been referred to as Oracle (13Passier R. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Mech. Dev. 2000; 92: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and two splice forms have been described. Oracle 1 and Oracle 2 correspond to Cypher1c and Cypher3c, respectively. It is possible that there are more novel isoforms of Cypher to be discovered. Our analysis of the six isoforms of Cypher expressed in striated muscle has revealed for the first time the existence of two classes of splice variants that are skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that splicing of Cypher mRNA is developmentally regulated both in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In both cardiac and skeletal muscle, Cypher2, the short isoform, is expressed to barely detectable levels during embryogenesis, with expression increasing postnatally, suggesting an important role for this isoform in mature muscle. In cardiac muscle, the predominant long isoform throughout development is Cypher1c. However, in skeletal muscle, the predominant long isoform switches from Cypher1s during embryogenesis and in neonatal muscle to Cypher3s with progressive aging. The discovery of cardiac and skeletal muscle-specific domains in Cypher suggests that mutations in the humancypher gene could result in human disease with symptoms restricted to either heart or skeletal muscle or present in both, depending on which exons are affected by mutation. Mutations affecting exons specific to short Cypher2 isoforms or long Cypher1/3 isoforms or all isoforms might be expected to have varying severity. To investigate the ability of either short or long Cypher isoforms to rescue Cypher function in the null mutant, we substituted cDNAs encoding cypher2s or cypher3s for the endogenouscypher gene. These two skeletal isoforms have in common their N-terminal 255 amino acids containing the PDZ domain yet differ in their C-terminal sequences, with that of Cypher3s containing three LIM domains. No Cypher null mice can survive past 5 days postnatally. In contrast, a percentage of Cypher2sKI and Cypher3sKI homozygous mice can survive to adulthood, indicating that, in some contexts, the first 255 amino acids can provide sufficient Cypher function to ensure survival and that in this respect the remainder of the protein sequence, including the three LIM domains, is dispensable. However, only 50% of Cypher2KI mice and 20% of Cypher3SKI mice survive, and survivors all display growth retardation and pathological striated muscle phenotypes, suggesting that each isoform has distinct functional roles that are required for normal muscle structure and function. Pathological changes within the mutant muscle were of a myopathic, noninflammatory nature and could fit into a dystrophic phenotype. RNA and protein analyses demonstrated that both Cypher2s and Cypher3s are up-regulated during the course of development and are the two predominant isoforms in adult skeletal muscle (Fig. 3, B,D, and F). However, at postnatal day 1, Cypher1s and Cypher2s are the predominant isoforms in skeletal muscle, with Cypher3s being expressed at very low levels, suggesting that Cypher1s and/or Cypher2s are required for muscle function at this period of time. This may explain why ∼80% of Cypher3sKI and only 50% of Cypher2sKI homozygous mice die within the first week after birth. The fibrotic phenotype we observe in cardiac muscle could reflect the absence of cardiac muscle-specific isoforms or the requirement for both long and short isoforms. The knock-in approach utilized here does not allow us to discriminate between these two possibilities. To address this issue, we are currently knocking out cardiac or skeletal muscle-specific cypher exons. We thank Dr. Jim Lin for tropomyosin antibody and Norma Prades for technical assistance."

Vesicular synaptotagmin 1 is essential for fast synchronous SNARE-mediated exocytosis and interacts with the SNAREs in brain material. To uncover the step at which synaptotagmin becomes linked to the three SNAREs, we purified all four proteins from brain membranes and analyzed their interactions. Our study reveals that, in the absence of calcium, native synaptotagmin 1 binds the t-SNARE heterodimer, formed from syntaxin and SNAP-25. This interaction is both stoichiometric and of high affinity. Synaptotagmin contains two divergent but conserved C2 domains that can act independently in calcium-triggered phospholipid binding. We now show that both C2 domains are strictly required for the calcium-independent interaction with the t-SNARE heterodimer, indicating that the double C2 domain structure of synaptotagmin may have evolved to acquire a function beyond calcium/phospholipid binding.

Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). Whereas most intracellular membrane fusion reactions are constitutive, neurotransmission relies on the coupling of neurotransmitter release to calcium influx into the nerve terminal (4Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). On calcium entry, a proportion of synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitter with a delay of less than 1 ms (5Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Google Scholar). The synchronization of neuronal exocytosis to calcium entry has been attributed to synaptotagmin, a major synaptic vesicle protein (6Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Google Scholar, 7Yoshihara M. Littleton J.T. Neuron. 2002; 36: 897-908Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin contains two calcium-binding C2 domains and is proposed to be a calcium sensor in neuronal exocytosis (8Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Google Scholar,9Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Google Scholar).Despite identification of the major players involved in neurotransmitter release, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the tight coupling between calcium influx and synaptic vesicle exocytosis are still under debate (10Augustine G.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 320-326Google Scholar, 11Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Google Scholar). Previous biochemical studies implicated calcium-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to either syntaxin or SNAP-25 in vesicular exocytosis (12Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Google Scholar). However, the short delay between calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptotagmin is linked to the fusion machinery prior to calcium influx into the nerve terminal. Indeed, synaptotagmin, in the absence of calcium, co-purifies with the SNARE complexes from brain material as demonstrated using anti-syntaxin immunoprecipitation and α-SNAP affinity chromatography (15McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Google Scholar, 16Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar).The calcium-independent molecular link between the calcium sensor and the SNARE fusion machinery is not well understood, and the previous studies using recombinant protein fragments yielded conflicting results (reviewed in Refs. 10Augustine G.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 320-326Google Scholar and 11Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated this link using, for the first time, highly purified brain synaptotagmin and SNARE proteins as a starting point. We now demonstrate that brain-purified t-SNAREs, syntaxin and SNAP-25, form a stable heterodimer that can bind native synaptotagmin in the absence of calcium. Since this interaction can be reproduced using the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin 1, we were able to address the requirement for C2 domains in this binding. Our results show that the calcium-independent binding of synaptotagmin to the t-SNARE heterodimer requires the double C2 domain structure.RESULTSWe used a preparative anti-SNAP-25 immunoaffinity chromatography to test an interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs in the absence of calcium in native material, namely bovine brain membranes. The brain membrane extract was incubated with an anti-SNAP-25 antibody covalently attached to Sepharose beads in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, a calcium-chelating agent. Following a two-step elution, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining (Fig.1, left panel). For identification of protein bands both Western immunoblotting and mass spectrometry were used (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The 0.6m NaCl eluate contained synaptotagmin 1, whereas the pH 2.5 eluate contained the three SNAREs and complexin. To determine the specificity of protein isolation on the anti-SNAP-25 column, we performed a chromatography of the brain extract using control beads with covalently attached bovine serum albumin. Myelin basic protein, but not synaptotagmin nor complexin, bound to the control beads (Fig.1, right panel). Thus, synaptotagmin and complexin are the major proteins that specifically co-purify with the SNARE complexes, in the absence of divalent cations.Several scenarios can account for the co-purification of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs on the anti-SNAP-25 column. Synaptotagmin may interact with monomeric SNAP-25 as suggested previously (20Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Google Scholar). Alternatively, it may interact with SNARE complexes containing SNAP-25. Thus, we investigated whether SNAP-25 can form stable complexes with syntaxin and synaptobrevin. Fig. 2 Ashows that SNAP-25, prebound to anti-SNAP-25-Sepharose beads, was able to bind syntaxin and could only bind synaptobrevin when syntaxin was present. Therefore, co-purification of synaptotagmin 1 during anti-SNAP-25 chromatography may be due to its interaction with either SNAP-25 alone and/or the t-SNARE heterodimer and/or the full ternary SNARE complex. To distinguish between these possibilities, we prepared anti-SNAP-25-Sepharose beads carrying either SNAP-25 alone, the t-SNARE heterodimer, or the full SNARE complex and incubated them with brain-purified synaptotagmin 1. After washing, bound protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 2 B). The native synaptotagmin, in the absence of calcium, was able to interact with the t-SNARE heterodimer and the ternary SNARE complex, but not with SNAP-25 alone. We conclude that, in the case of brain-purified proteins, the interaction of synaptotagmin with the native or re-assembled SNARE complexes does not require calcium.Figure 2Brain-purified synaptotagmin 1 binds the t-SNARE heterodimer in the absence of calcium. A, beads with immobilized SNAP-25 were mixed with input material composed of syntaxin and synaptobrevin individually or together. After extensive washing, proteins bound to the beads were eluted into sample buffer. Boiled samples of input (left panel) and bound (right panel) material were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. SNAP-25 binds syntaxin alone and synaptobrevin only in the presence of syntaxin. B, anti-SNAP-25 beads with prebound ternary SNARE complex, SNAP-25 alone, or the t-SNARE heterodimer were then incubated with brain purified synaptotagmin 1 for 30 min at room temperature in 2 mm EDTA. After washing, boiled samples of the input and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. Synaptotagmin 1 binds the ternary SNARE complex and the t-SNARE heterodimer in the absence of calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Since in the SNARE assembly pathway the stable t-SNARE heterodimer exists in brain (21Chen D. Minger S.L. Honer W.G. Whiteheart S.W. Brain Res. 1999; 831: 11-24Google Scholar) and precedes the ternary SNARE complex (22Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Google Scholar), we analyzed in more detail the calcium-independent interaction of synaptotagmin with syntaxin and SNAP-25. First, we tested whether the recombinant cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin 1 (C2AB, amino acids 96–421) has the ability to bind monomeric SNAREs and/or the t-SNARE heterodimer. In the absence of calcium, the cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin bound the t-SNARE heterodimer, but none of the monomeric SNAREs (Fig. 3 A). To determine the binding efficiency we analyzed the stoichiometry of interaction using fluorescent Sypro Orange staining, which labels proteins quantitatively (23Steinberg T.H. Jones L.J. Haugland R.P. Singer V.L. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 223-237Google Scholar). The two t-SNAREs were incubated with the immobilized cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin and, after washing, the bound protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Sypro Orange staining. Quantification of bound dye in relation to the molecular masses of the bound proteins yielded a molar ratio of 1:1.28:1.2 for synaptotagmin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25, respectively (Fig.3 B). We conclude that the binding of GST-C2AB to the t-SNAREs is approximately equimolar. We next investigated the dependence for binding of SNAP-25 to synaptotagmin as a function of syntaxin concentration. Syntaxin at concentrations ranging from 27 nm to 1.7 μm was added to GST-C2AB beads in the presence of a constant concentration of SNAP-25. Syntaxin promoted binding of SNAP-25 to synaptotagmin at concentrations above 100 nm with the half-maximal binding measured at 290 nm (Fig. 3 C).Figure 3The cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin 1 binds stoichiometrically and with high affinity to the t-SNARE heterodimer. A, input consisting of either monomeric SNAREs or the t-SNARE heterodimer (left panel) was incubated for 30 min with immobilized GST-C2AB in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. After extensive washing the bound proteins (right panel) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin (GST-C2AB) binds the t-SNARE heterodimer in the absence of calcium.B, GST-C2AB immobilized on beads was incubated with syntaxin and SNAP-25 in the presence of 2 mm EDTA. After washing, the bound material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Sypro Orange staining. Staining density was converted to molar ratios, demonstrating stoichiometric binding of the t-SNARE heterodimer to the cytoplasmic part of synaptotagmin. C, binding of SNAP-25 to GST-C2AB beads as a function of syntaxin concentration. SNAP-25 (2 μm) was incubated with GST-C2AB (50 ng) immobilized on beads in the presence of varying concentrations of syntaxin (0–1.7 μm). Bound SNAP-25 was analyzed by Western immunoblotting and densitometric analysis. Fitting a dose-response relationship yielded an EC50 for syntaxin-dependent SNAP-25 binding of 290 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Two versions of the synaptotagmin cytoplasmic domain were cloned, one with a mutation of glycine to aspartic acid at residue 374 in the second C2 domain (C2B) (19Schiavo G.

Nature. 1990; 345: 260-263Google Scholar). This mutation has been shown to adversely effect folding of the C2B β-strand barrel structure (25Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Neuron. 2001; 32: 1057-1069Google Scholar). Fig. 4 B shows that the t-SNARE heterodimer bound the wild-type cytoplasmic part, but not its mutated version, suggesting that either both C2 domains or the C2B domain alone are required for this interaction. We therefore analyzed whether, in the absence of calcium, individual C2 domains from the wild-type cytoplasmic part can be the t-SNARE heterodimer. Neither of the individual C2 domains was able to bind the t-SNARE heterodimer, but when linked together they exhibited efficient binding (Fig.4 C).Figure 4A requirement for both C2 domains of synaptotagmin for interaction with the t-SNARE heterodimer.

The asterisk indicates a breakdown product of the mutated GST-C2AB present on both the original beads (left panel) and after incubation with syntaxin and SNAP-25 (right panel). Input and bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.

Only the cytoplasmic part containing both C2 domains (C2AB) was able to bind the t-SNARE heterodimer.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONSynaptotagmin, the proposed calcium sensor, is essential for coupling the calcium signal to the synaptic vesicle exocytosis (6Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Google Scholar, 7Yoshihara M. Littleton J.T. Neuron. 2002; 36: 897-908Google Scholar). In this study we addressed whether such coupling could be due to a physical link between the calcium sensor and the SNARE fusion machinery. We demonstrated by an anti-SNAP-25 immunoaffinity approach that synaptotagmin, in the absence of calcium, can specifically co-purify with the SNAREs from bovine brain detergent extract (Fig. 1). This is in agreement with the previously observed calcium-independent association of synaptotagmin with the SNARE complexes by anti-syntaxin immunoprecipitation from rat brain (15McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Google Scholar) and by α-SNAP affinity chromatography from bovine brain (16Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). Moreover, syntaxin itself was originally identified as a protein that co-purifies in the absence of calcium with synaptotagmin by anti-synaptotagmin immunoisolation (26Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Google Scholar). It is notable that further studies, using recombinant syntaxin, questioned an efficient calcium-independent link between synaptotagmin and syntaxin (12Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Google Scholar), suggesting that either syntaxin may require other proteins for this interaction or the bacterially expressed SNARE fragments are deficient in some of their properties (11Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Google Scholar).To address the molecular basis for the calcium-independent association between the SNAREs and synaptotagmin, we used for the first time brain-purified SNARE proteins and native synaptotagmin in parallel with its truncated versions. Three SNARE proteins, when mixed, formed the ternary complex that can bind synaptotagmin (Fig. 2). We further analyzed the possible calcium-independent association of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs in the stages preceding the ternary SNARE complex. Syntaxin and SNAP-25 can form a stable intermediate on the pathway from the three monomeric SNAREs to their ternary complex, consistent with a central role for the t-SNARE heterodimer in SNARE complex formation (Fig. 2 A) (21Chen D. Minger S.L. Honer W.G. Whiteheart S.W. Brain Res. 1999; 831: 11-24Google Scholar, 22Fasshauer D. Antonin W. Subramaniam V. Jahn R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 144-151Google Scholar). Remarkably, the t-SNARE heterodimer, but not monomeric SNAREs, was able to bind synaptotagmin with high affinity and stoichiometrically in the absence of calcium (Fig. 3). Association of syntaxin with SNAP-25 at the release sites in the presynaptic membrane, therefore, may be an important step for further engagement of both vesicular synaptotagmin and synaptobrevin. As synaptobrevin is potently inhibited on synaptic vesicle membrane (27Hu K. Carroll J. Fedorovich S. Rickman C. Sukhodub A. Davletov B. Nature. 2002; 415: 646-650Google Scholar), synaptotagmin interaction with the t-SNARE heterodimer may precede and facilitate further engagement of synaptobrevin into the fusion-competent SNARE complex.A quantitive electron microscopy study of synapse morphology in the absence of synaptotagmin revealed that synaptic vesicles are no longer maintained in close proximity to the presynaptic membrane (28Reist N.E. Buchanan J. Li J. DiAntonio A. Buxton E.M. Schwarz T.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7662-7673Google Scholar). One attractive mechanism for this phenomenon was put forward, whereby synaptotagmin interacts in the absence of calcium with monomeric SNAP-25 to position the vesicles at the release sites (20Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis is inconsistent with the observation that SNAP-25 is found throughout the plasma membrane (21Chen D. Minger S.L. Honer W.G. Whiteheart S.W.

In addition, further studies could only detect binding of synaptotagmin to SNAP-25 by Western immunoblotting (14Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Google Scholar, 30Gerona R.R. Larsen E.C. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6328-6336Google Scholar), suggesting a low affinity interaction. In our study monomeric SNAP-25 did not interact with synaptotagmin (Figs. 2 and 3) probably because we used brain-purified protein that may differ in its properties compared with SNAP-25 expressed in bacteria. Importantly, genetic manipulations of both syntaxin and SNAP-25 result in the uncoupling of calcium entry and exocytosis (14Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Google Scholar,31Wu M.N. Fergestad T. Lloyd T.E. He Y. Broadie K. Bellen H.J. Neuron. 1999; 23: 593-605Google Scholar), indicating that both t-SNAREs participate in linking synaptotagmin to the fusion machinery.Finally, our data shows that both C2A and C2B domains of synaptotagmin 1 are required for the calcium-independent interaction with the t-SNARE heterodimer (Fig. 4). Phospholipases, protein kinases, and other enzymes contain a single copy of the C2 domain that is known to drive their calcium-dependent translocation to cellular membranes (32Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2375-2390Google Scholar). A number of trafficking proteins, on the other hand,e.g. DOC2, Munc13, rabphilin, the large family of synaptotagmins and others, have a closely aligned double C2 domain structure (33Duncan R.R. Shipston M.J. Chow R.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 421-426Google Scholar, 34Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Google Scholar). One remarkable property of these C2 domains is that they often lack calcium binding aspartate residues and are not able to bind phospholipid membranes in response to calcium (12Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Google Scholar, 34Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Google Scholar). Intriguingly, knock-in studies of synaptotagmin 1 itself demonstrated that calcium binding is dispensable for the C2A but not the C2B domain (35Mackler J.M. Drummond J.A. Loewen C.A. Robinson I.M. Reist N.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 340-344Google Scholar, 36Robinson I.M. Ranjan R. Schwarz T.L. Nature. 2002; 418: 336-340Google Scholar, 37Fernandez-Chacon R. Shin O.H. Konigstorfer A. Matos M.F. Meyer A.C. Garcia J. Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Rosenmund C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8438-8446Google Scholar). These observations point to a functional importance of the double C2 domain structure that cannot solely be explained on the basis of the calcium-dependent properties of each domain (37Fernandez-Chacon R. Shin O.H. Konigstorfer A. Matos M.F. Meyer A.C. Garcia J. Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Rosenmund C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8438-8446Google Scholar). Indeed, our study provides a novel explanation for the functional importance of the double C2 domain structure: two C2 domains of synaptotagmin act together to bind, with high affinity and in the absence of calcium, t-SNARE heterodimers in the target membranes. Syntaxin, SNAP-25, 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa; SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa; SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight and synaptobrevin, also known as VAMP, are members of a large family of SNARE proteins that likely execute fusion in all intracellular compartments (1Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar, 2Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Google Scholar, 3Sollner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Google Scholar). Whereas most intracellular membrane fusion reactions are constitutive, neurotransmission relies on the coupling of neurotransmitter release to calcium influx into the nerve terminal (4Katz B. The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances. Liverpool University Press, Liverpool, UK1969Google Scholar). On calcium entry, a proportion of synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release neurotransmitter with a delay of less than 1 ms (5Augustine G.J. Charlton M.P. Smith S.J. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1987; 10: 633-693Google Scholar). The synchronization of neuronal exocytosis to calcium entry has been attributed to synaptotagmin, a major synaptic vesicle protein (6Geppert M. Goda Y. Hammer R.E. Li C. Rosahl T.W. Stevens C.F. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 717-727Google Scholar, 7Yoshihara M. Littleton J.T. Neuron. 2002; 36: 897-908Google Scholar). Synaptotagmin contains two calcium-binding C2 domains and is proposed to be a calcium sensor in neuronal exocytosis (8Perin M.S. Brose N. Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 623-629Google Scholar,9Brose N. Petrenko A.G. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Science. 1992; 256: 1021-1025Google Scholar). Despite identification of the major players involved in neurotransmitter release, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the tight coupling between calcium influx and synaptic vesicle exocytosis are still under debate (10Augustine G.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 320-326Google Scholar, 11Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Google Scholar). Previous biochemical studies implicated calcium-dependent binding of synaptotagmin to either syntaxin or SNAP-25 in vesicular exocytosis (12Li C. Ullrich B. Zhang J.Z. Anderson R.G. Brose N. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 594-599Google Scholar, 13Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Google Scholar, 14Zhang X. Kim-Miller M.J. Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Martin T.F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 599-611Google Scholar). However, the short delay between calcium influx and the fusion of synaptic vesicles suggests that synaptotagmin is linked to the fusion machinery prior to calcium influx into the nerve terminal. Indeed, synaptotagmin, in the absence of calcium, co-purifies with the SNARE complexes from brain material as demonstrated using anti-syntaxin immunoprecipitation and α-SNAP affinity chromatography (15McMahon H.T. Missler M. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 1995; 83: 111-119Google Scholar, 16Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Google Scholar). The calcium-independent molecular link between the calcium sensor and the SNARE fusion machinery is not well understood, and the previous studies using recombinant protein fragments yielded conflicting results (reviewed in Refs. 10Augustine G.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 320-326Google Scholar and 11Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 1-13Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated this link using, for the first time, highly purified brain synaptotagmin and SNARE proteins as a starting point. We now demonstrate that brain-purified t-SNAREs, syntaxin and SNAP-25, form a stable heterodimer that can bind native synaptotagmin in the absence of calcium. Since this interaction can be reproduced using the recombinant cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin 1, we were able to address the requirement for C2 domains in this binding. Our results show that the calcium-independent binding of synaptotagmin to the t-SNARE heterodimer requires the double C2 domain structure. RESULTSWe used a preparative anti-SNAP-25 immunoaffinity chromatography to test an interaction of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs in the absence of calcium in native material, namely bovine brain membranes. The brain membrane extract was incubated with an anti-SNAP-25 antibody covalently attached to Sepharose beads in the presence of 2 mm EDTA, a calcium-chelating agent. Following a two-step elution, bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining (Fig.1, left panel). For identification of protein bands both Western immunoblotting and mass spectrometry were used (Fig. 1 and data not shown). The 0.6m NaCl eluate contained synaptotagmin 1, whereas the pH 2.5 eluate contained the three SNAREs and complexin. To determine the specificity of protein isolation on the anti-SNAP-25 column, we performed a chromatography of the brain extract using control beads with covalently attached bovine serum albumin. Myelin basic protein, but not synaptotagmin nor complexin, bound to the control beads (Fig.1, right panel). Thus, synaptotagmin and complexin are the major proteins that specifically co-purify with the SNARE complexes, in the absence of divalent cations.Several scenarios can account for the co-purification of synaptotagmin with the SNAREs on the anti-SNAP-25 column. Synaptotagmin may interact with monomeric SNAP-25 as suggested previously (20Schiavo G. Stenbeck G. Rothman J.E. Sollner T.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 997-1001Google Scholar).

Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar); in an ATP-dependent reaction, the C terminus of ubiquitin is linked via a thioester bond to a cysteine residue in the active site of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1).1 The ubiquitin thioester is then transferred to the active site cysteine of an E2, which mediates the attachment of the ubiquitin C terminus to a lysine residue of the target protein, resulting in an isopeptide bond. This last step is most often catalyzed by another enzyme, termed ubiquitin-protein ligase or E3. Repeated rounds of ubiquitylation result in the formation of long multiubiquitin chains in which each ubiquitin moiety is linked to an internal lysine residue, usually Lys48, of the preceding one (6Chau V.

All of the eukaryotic genomes encode multiple E2s and an even larger number of E3s, the latter being responsible for substrate recognition (5Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev.

One prominent class of ubiquitin protein ligases is characterized by the presence of a RING domain, a specialized type of zinc finger in which two Zn2+ ions are coordinated by a group of cysteine or histidine residues in a characteristic arrangement (9Borden K.L.

Modification by ubiquitin generally marks a protein for degradation by the 26 S proteasome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6902) Google Scholar). However, ubiquitylation can also convey nonproteolytic signals (2Conaway R.C. Brower C.S. Conaway J.W.

In particular, nonstandard multiubiquitin chains in which one ubiquitin moiety is linked to the next via Lys63 have been implicated in such diverse processes as DNA damage repair (22Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), endocytosis (23Galan J. Haguenauer-Tsapis R.

Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar). In yeast and mammals, the only enzymatic activity demonstrated so far to catalyze the assembly of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains resides in the heterodimeric complex of UBC13 and MMS2, a genuine UBC and a structurally related ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant (27Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The function of Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in DNA damage repair has been attributed to a participation of UBC13 and MMS2 in the postreplication repair pathway (27Hofmann R.M. Pickart C.M. Cell. 1999; 96: 645-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 28Broomfield S. Chow B.L. Xiao W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5678-5683Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), which confers damage tolerance and ensures the completion of genome duplication in situations where lesions in the template strand cause a stalling of the replication machinery (21Ulrich H.D. Eukaryotic Cell. 2002; 1: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 30Friedberg E.C.

BioEssays. 1994; 16: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The principal mediator of postreplication repair is RAD6 (32Reynolds P. Weber S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which encodes another UBC (33Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). It is believed to be targeted to sites of damage by the DNA-binding RING finger protein RAD18 (34Bailly V. Lauder S. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23360-23365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An error-free subpathway within the RAD6 system is mediated by another chromatin-associated RING finger protein, the SWI/SNF homolog RAD5 (35Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28259-28262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). I have previously shown that the function of UBC13 and MMS2 in the RAD6 pathway in yeast is mediated by RAD5, which contacts UBC13 through its RING domain and recruits the E2 heterodimer to the chromatin in response to DNA damage (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Through its association with the RAD6-RAD18 dimer, RAD5 thus coordinates the assembly of two different E2s on damaged chromatin, suggesting a cooperation of RAD6 and the UBC13-MMS2 complex with the RING finger proteins RAD18 and RAD5 in ubiquitin conjugation (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In confirmation of this model it was recently shown that proliferating cell nuclear antigen, a processivity factor for a number of DNA polymerases dedicated to replication as well as repair, is modified by Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in response to DNA damage (37Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). This modification depends on the presence of RAD5, UBC13 and MMS2, whereas RAD6 and RAD18 in the absence of the former afford only mono-ubiquitylation (37Hoege C. Pfander B. Moldovan G.L. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nature. 2002; 419: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the UBC13-MMS2-RAD5 assembly indeed functions as a genuine E2-E3 complex for the assembly of Lys63-linked multiubiquitin chains. Support for this notion is presented here by a genetic and biochemical analysis of the protein-protein interactions within this E2-RING finger complex and their consequences for cooperation between RAD5 and the UBC13-MMS2 dimer in DNA damage repair. The wt yeast strain used in this study as well as the isogenic mutantsubc13::HIS3,rad5::HIS3, andubc13::HIS3 rad5::HIS3 have been described previously (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Strain PJ69-4A (38James P. Halladay J. Craig E.A. Genetics. 1996; 144: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for two-hybrid assays. Standard protocols were followed for the preparation of yeast media and transformations (39Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar). SC medium was a modification from that described by Guthrie and Fink (39Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991Google Scholar) and contained 100 mg/liter of each amino acid except for leucine, which was present at 200 mg/liter. This corresponds to a cysteine concentration of 0.67 mm. Yeast strains harboring integrative plasmids were propagated in YPD medium following the initial selection on solid and in liquid medium after transformation; strains with centromeric plasmids were maintained in selective SC medium at all times. Two-hybrid constructs bearing the ORFs of RAD5, UBC13, and MMS2 have been described (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and recloned into the two-hybrid vectors, and the amplified regions were fully sequenced. The intron was removed during construction of the UBC13 mutants; however, its presence or absence did not affect protein levels. 2H. D. Ulrich, unpublished observation. For expression under the control of the native promoter, the RAD5 ORF and the RING finger mutants were recloned from the two-hybrid vectors asBamHI/PstI fragments into a derivative of the integrative vector YIplac211 (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar) carrying anEcoRI/BamHI fragment encompassing 245 bp of theRAD5 upstream region and a PstI/SphI fragment derived from pGBT9 (Clontech) as a transcriptional terminator (YIp211-PRAD5-RAD5).UBC13 and its mutants were expressed under the control of the native promoter in a similar vector in which 996 bp of theUBC13 upstream regions were inserted as anEcoRI/BamHI fragment upstream of the ORF (YIp211-PUBC13-UBC13). Regulatable expression levels were achieved by placing the UBC13 wt or mutant ORFs under the control of the MET3 promoter into the centromeric vector YCplac111 (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2521) Google Scholar), again in combination with the pGBT9-derived transcriptional terminator (YCp111-PMET3-UBC13). For the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, UBC13 and MMS2 as well as the respective mutants were recloned into expression vectors, allowing the production of different fusion proteins. pGEX-4T-1 (AmershamBiosciences) was used to produce N-terminal GST fusions of UBC13 and its mutants, MMS2, and GST alone. pQE-30 (Qiagen) served as an expression vector for His6-tagged UBC13. The MMS2 ORF as well as the mutant F8A were inserted into the vector pTYB12 (New England Biolabs). This vector affords expression of MMS2 as an N-terminal fusion to a chitin-binding domain, linked by the self-cleavable VMA1 intein sequence, which allows single-step purification of MMS2 bearing three additional amino acids (AGH) at its N terminus. For simplicity, this construct will be referred to as MMS2 in the following text. Sequence maps of all the constructs used in this study are available on request. Analysis of the interactions between RAD5, UBC13, and MMS2 in the two-hybrid system was performed as described previously, using growth on histidine-selective medium as an indication for a positive interaction (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). UV sensitivities were determined by means of survival curves or gradient plate assays as described previously (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 41Ulrich H.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3487-3494Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All of the irradiations were performed at 1.67 J m−2 s−1. Selective medium was used before and after irradiation for strains bearing centromeric vectors. Yeast cultures were grown at 28 °C to exponential phase. Samples of 108cells were lysed by NaOH/β-mercaptoethanol treatment, and the total protein was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid as described (42Silver P.A. Chiang A. Sadler I. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Aliquots were analyzed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, followed by Western blots using an affinity-purified anti-UBC13 antibody (see below). Recombinant proteins were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring the respective expression constructs by induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 6 h at 28 °C. Purifications were achieved in a single step by affinity chromatography on the appropriate columns (glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Novagen or Qiagen), or chitin beads (New England Biolabs) for GST, His6, or chitin-binding domain-intein fusions, respectively) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA and stored frozen at −80 °C in the presence of 10% (v/v) glycerol. The protein concentrations were determined by absorbance at 280 nm based on calculated extinction coefficients. Polyclonal antibodies against the His6-UBC13 protein were raised in rabbit and purified by affinity chromatography on CH Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) covalently derivatized with GST-UBC13. Interaction between UBC13 and MMS2 was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore X instrument. The proteins were dialyzed against HBS buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mmEDTA, 0.05% P-20 detergent). A CM5 chip was derivatized with 15,000 RU of an anti-GST antibody (Biacore) by amine coupling according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Subsequently, ∼850 RU of the GST fusion protein (ligand) were immobilized in one of the flow cells. A reference surface was generated by loading of ∼500 RU of underivatized GST in the other flow cell. The signal in this reference cell was subtracted online during all measurements. The soluble binding partner (analyte) was injected at a range of concentrations in 2-min pulses at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. Because of the fast dissociation rates, no regeneration of the chip surface was necessary between individual injections. After analysis of one particular set of proteins, the ligand was removed from the surface by a 2-min pulse of 10 mm glycine, pH 2.2, followed by immobilization of the next GST fusion protein to be analyzed. The signal at equilibrium (RU eq) was plotted against the analyte concentration C, and the steady state affinity K Aand dissociation constant K D were determined by a fit of this plot according to the model RU eq =K A·C·RU max/(1 + K A·C), whereRU max is the theoretical binding capacity at infinite analyte concentration and K D = 1/K A. Following the BiaEvaluationTMprogram, the fits were considered acceptable if the χ2values were below 10 and the residuals did not exceed a few RU. Ubiquitin chain synthesis was assayed at 30 °C in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Yeast E1 (Affiniti Research) was used at a concentration of 70 nm. Bovine ubiquitin (Sigma) was present at 0.5 mg/ml (58 μm). The reactions were set up with equimolar amounts of GST-UBC13 and MMS2 (0.5 or 5.0 μm each). The samples were withdrawn after 0, 1, 2, and 4 h, and the aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blots, using an anti-ubiquitin antiserum (Sigma). Site-directed mutagenesis of UBC13 and the RAD5 RING domain was guided by structural information on the UBC13-MMS2 dimer (43VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) as well as two mammalian RING finger ubiquitin-protein ligases in complex with their cognate E2s, c-Cbl with UbcH7 (15Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) and CNOT4 with UbcH5 (16Albert T.K. Hanzawa H. Legtenberg Y.I. de Ruwe M.J. van den Heuvel F.A. Collart M.A. Boelens R. Timmers H.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 355-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment of the RAD5 RING finger with the corresponding domains of c-Cbl and CNOT4 (Fig.1 A) revealed sufficient homology to allow the design of RAD5 mutations predicted to influence the contact with UBC13. Mutation C914S, which affects one of the cysteines involved in Zn2+ coordination, had previously been shown to disrupt interaction with the E2 (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Because this change is likely to disturb the integrity of the entire domain, additional more subtle mutations were designed by changing predicted surface residues to alanine. Residue Ile916 is conserved in many RING domains, and the corresponding amino acids in both c-Cbl and CNOT4 contact the respective E2. Positions Glu943 and Tyr944 could be aligned with the interface residues Ser407 and Trp408 in c-Cbl, and Asn959 again corresponds to a position involved in E2 contacts in both c-Cbl and CNOT4. In addition, D923A was designed as a control mutation representing a hydrophilic, thus likely surface-exposed residue distant to the putative E2 interface. In the c-Cbl-UbcH7 complex the E2 contacts the RING finger and adjacent regions by means of charged amino acids within its N-terminal α-helix (H1) as well as residues in the loops between β-sheets S3 and S4 as well as α-helices H2 and H3 (Ref. 15Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffrey P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B). The same structural elements are used in the binding of UbcH7 to a HECT type E3 (44Huang L. Kinnucan E. Wang G. Beaudenon S. Howley P.M. Huibregtse J.M. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1999; 286: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of the yeast and the human UBC13-MMS2 dimers revealed that the corresponding residues in UBC13 are accessible, and the presence of MMS2 would permit simultaneous contacts to the RAD5 RING finger (43VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 45Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Therefore, mutations in UBC13 were designed at the following positions: K6E and K10E in helix H1 and M64A and S96A in the loops. Mutation of Pro97, although more closely representative of the respective contact site in UbcH7 than Ser96, was avoided to exclude a perturbation of the overall protein structure. Mutation E55A was introduced as a control, because this residue had previously been shown to reside in the interface to MMS2 (43VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C. Pickart C.M. Wolberger C. Cell. 2001; 105: 711-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 45Moraes T.F. Edwards R.A. McKenna S. Pastushok L. Xiao W. Glover J.N. Ellison M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 669-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and should therefore have no effect on interaction with the RAD5 RING finger. The mutants designed within the RAD5 RING finger were analyzed with respect to their interactions with UBC13 in the two-hybrid system. This method has been used previously to demonstrate the interaction between the two proteins and correlates well with results obtained by co-immunoprecipitation (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that a negative result might be due to improper folding or expression of the mutant protein in the two-hybrid system, dimerization with RAD5 itself, which is independent of the RAD5-UBC13 contact, was assayed in parallel. Fig. 2 Ashows that all of the mutants retained association with RAD5 itself; however, they varied considerably in their ability to interact with UBC13. Mutation C914S, an exchange likely to disrupt the structural integrity of the entire RING domain, had previously been shown to prevent the interaction with UBC13 (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Mutation D923A had no effect on association with UBC13, which was expected because this residue should occupy a position in the RING finger facing away from the putative E2 contact site. Mutations I916A, Y944A, and N959A, all predicted to reside on the surface of the RING domain facing the E2, indeed abolished interaction with UBC13 in the two-hybrid system. In contrast, mutation of Glu943, also predicted to contribute to the E2 interface, to alanine did not prevent interaction with UBC13. Thus, the interaction of the RAD5 RING finger with UBC13 involves a surface similar but not identical to that within other RING domains, including several highly conserved residues but also showing variations that are likely to affect the respective E2 specificity. In the reciprocal approach, the ability of the putative contact site mutants of UBC13 to interact with RAD5 was examined. Interaction with MMS2, which is independent of the UBC13-RAD5 association (36Ulrich H.D. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3388-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), was examined in parallel to ensure proper function of the mutants in the two-hybrid system. UBC13(E55A) served as a control for a protein that should only be affected in its association with MMS2 but not with RAD5. The results of the two-hybrid analysis are shown in Fig. 2 B. As expected, mutant UBC13(E55A) was found to associate with RAD5, but interaction with MMS2 was abolished. In contrast, all other mutants were capable of association with MMS2 but had lost their ability to interact with RAD5. These results indicate that amino acids critical for UBC13-RAD5 contacts reside within the N-terminal helix of UBC13 (Lys6 and Lys10) as well as the loops L1 (Met64) and L2 (Ser96) (Fig. 1 B). Thus, the UBC13 interface to the RAD5 RING finger closely resembles the corresponding interfaces of other E2 enzymes with their respective ubiquitin-protein ligases. To examine the effects of the different contact site mutations on the ability of RAD5 and UBC13 to cooperate in DNA damage repair in vivo, the mutant genes were integrated into the genome and expressed under the control of their own promoters in the respective deletion strains. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of the UV sensitivities of representative mutants. Mutant C914S, in which one of the Zn2+-coordinating cysteines is replaced by serine, showed by far the largest effect on cell survival; in fact, its UV sensitivity was more severe than that of theubc13 deletion, indicating that a structural perturbation of the RING domain affects more aspects of RAD5 function than solely its cooperation with UBC13 (Fig. 3 A). Nevertheless, C914S was epistatic to ubc13, because deletion of the E2 in this mutant had no additional effect on UV sensitivity, suggesting that UBC13 function in DNA repair entirely depends on the integrity of the RAD5 RING domain. Yet, this mutant was less sensitive to UV irradiation than a rad5 deletion; thus, RAD5 must have an additional role in DNA repair that is independent of its RING finger. Mutant I916A displayed a UV sensitivity very similar to that of the ubc13deletion (Fig. 3 A). The fact that the double mutantubc13 rad5(I916A) showed no further increase in UV sensitivity indicates that mutation of this residue apparently eliminates all aspects of RAD5 functions that involve a cooperation with UBC13 but leave all of its UBC13-independent functions intact. Mutation D923A had no influence on the UV sensitivity of the respective strain, again confirming that this residue i"

In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that control Fas-mediated signaling in glioma cells. Fas agonistic antibody, CH-11, induced apoptosis in sensitive glioma cells through caspase-8 recruitment to the Fas-mediated death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) where caspase-8 was cleaved to initiate apoptosis through a systematic cleavage of downstream substrates. In contrast, CH-11 stimulated cell growth in resistant glioma cells through recruitment of c-FLIP (cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin-1β-converting enzyme (FLICE)-inhibitory protein) to the Fas-mediated DISC. Three isoforms of long form c-FLIP were detected in glioma cells, but only the phosphorylated isoform was recruited to and cleaved into a p43 intermediate form in the Fas-mediated DISC in resistant cells. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) activity was up-regulated in resistant cells. Treatment of resistant cells with the CaMK II inhibitor KN-93 inhibited CaMK II activity, reduced c-FLIP expression, inhibited c-FLIP phosphorylation, and rescued CH-11 sensitivity. Transfection of CaMK II cDNA in sensitive cells rendered them resistant to CH-11. These results indicated that CaMK II regulates c-FLIP expression and phosphorylation, thus modulating Fas-mediated signaling in glioma cells.

The c-FLIP gene is composed of 13 exons that are clustered within ∼200 kilobases within the caspase-8 and caspase-10 genes on human chromosome 2q33 to 34 (25, 28). c-FLIP is expressed as four main mRNA splice variants but only two forms of protein in human tissues (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

The short form protein (c-FLIPS,M r ∼28) contains two DEDs and is structurally related to v-FLIP; the longer form (c-FLIPL,M r ∼55) is structurally similar to caspase-8 and contains two DEDs and a caspase-like domain that lacks catalytic activity (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.-L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2227) Google Scholar). c-FLIPL is expressed in many tissues, but c-FLIPS is found mainly in lymphatic tissue (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M.

Expression of c-FLIP mRNA and proteins is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase in T lymphocytes (29Yeh J.H. Hsu S.C. Han S.H. Lai M.Z. J. Exp.

Chem. 2001; 276: 6893-6896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here we show calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) regulates c-FLIP expression and phosphorylation in malignant glioma cells. Many tumor cells express Fas yet are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (31Weller M. Frei K. Groscurth P. Krammer P.H. Yonekawa Y. Fontana A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 32Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Gibson A.A. Tillman D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2205-2209PubMed Google Scholar). An earlier observation, that c-FLIP is overexpressed in human melanomas, suggests that c-FLIP may inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis in these tumors (33Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies in vivo have shown that high c-FLIP expression in transfected tumor cells promotes tumor growth and facilitates tumor immune escape (34Djerbi M. Screpanti V. Catrina A.I. Bogen B. Biberfeld P. Grandien A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1025-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar,35Medema J.P. de Jong J. van Hall T. Melief C.J.M. Offringa R. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), which further strengthens the concept that c-FLIP up-regulation is implicated in tumor pathogenesis. To investigate the molecular mechanisms in c-FLIP-mediated regulation of Fas signaling, we examined Fas-mediated DISC and its modulation in glioma cells and showed that c-FLIP regulates Fas signaling through its recruitment to the Fas-mediated DISC. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CaMK II regulates c-FLIP expression and phosphorylation, thus modulating Fas-medicated signaling in malignant glioma cells. The human malignant glioma cell lines LN-18, LN-215, LN-464, and LN-443 (gifts from N. De Tribolet, Lausanne, Switzerland) and U343MG and T98G (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Primary monoclonal antibodies used in the study included anti-human Fas clone 13, FADD, and CaMK II (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), Fas CH-11, caspase-8, and caspase-10 (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan), DFF45 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada), and c-FLIP NF6 clone (26Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Primary polyclonal rabbit antibodies included anti-human caspase-3, c-FLIP, and ERK1/2 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada), phosphothreonine (Research Diagnostics, Inc. Flanders, NJ), and PED serum (36Condorelli G. Vigliotta G. Iavarone C. Caruso M. Tocchetti C.G. Andreozzi F. Cafieri A. Tecce M.F. Formisano P. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3858-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Secondary antibodies included HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2b and IgG1 antibodies (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). [32P]Orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences), phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen), the CaMK II activity assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were purchased from the commercial sources. Goat anti-mouse IgM-agarose, KN-93, acid phosphatase, complete protease inhibitor mixture, Triton X-100, CHAPS, and all other chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma. For cell death, cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 2×104 cells/well and treated at 37 °C for 24 h with 1 μg/ml anti-Fas CH-11 or 100 μm KN-93 alone or in combination. Cell death was determined by crystal violet assay (37Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). For cleavage of caspases, DFF45, and c-FLIP, subconfluent cells were treated with 1 μg/ml CH-11 either in the presence or absence of 100 μm KN-93 at 37 °C for the times indicated. At each time point, cells were lysed in lysis buffer (1%Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were subjected to Western blotting. Immunoprecipitation for DISC analysis was performed according to a modified protocol as we previously reported (38Xiao C. Yang B.F. Asadi N. Beguinot F. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25020-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). 5 ×107 cells were stimulated with 1 μg/ml CH-11 (mouse IgM) for 30 min at 37 °C and then lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer. In unstimulated controls, the cells were lysed, and 1 μg of CH-11 was added to 1 ml of cell lysates to immunoprecipitate non-stimulated Fas receptors. The soluble fraction was immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of goat anti-mouse IgM-agarose overnight at 4 °C and analyzed by Western blotting and two-dimensional PAGE immunoblotting. For each sample, 107 cells were either treated with 100 μm KN-93 for 24 h at 37 °C or left untreated and lysed in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 65 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture. After centrifugation, the supernatants were precipitated with acetone. The pellets were dissolved in 9.8m urea, 2% CHAPS, 0.5% pH 3–10 non-linear IPG buffer (Amersham Biosciences) 65 mm dithiothreitol, applied by rehydration in 13-cm DryStrips (pH 3–10 non-linear), and electrofocused with IPGphorTM System following the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). The strips were equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 murea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and immunoblotting. For labeling of cellular phosphoproteins, cells were incubated for 1 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) and then labeled for 4 h in phosphate-free DMEM supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml 32P. Cells were lysed, and cell extracts were subjected to two-dimensional-PAGE followed by autoradiography and immunoblotting, as described above. For dephosphorylation of cellular phosphoproteins, cell lysates obtained from cells were treated with 0.2 units/ml acid phosphatase for 3 h at 37 °C and subsequently subjected to two-dimensional PAGE immunoblotting. For Western blot, cell extracts and immunoprecipitated DISC samples were separated through SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with blocking buffer (5% nonfat dry milk (for phosphoprotein detection, dry milk was substituted with 3% bovine serum albumin), Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl), 0.5% Tween 20)) for 2 h at room temperature and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: anti-caspase-8, anti-DFF45 and anti-c-FLIP (1:1000), anti-caspase-3 and anti-PED (1:5000), anti-caspase-10, anti-Fas clone 13, anti-CaMK II, and anti-ERK1/2 (1:500), anti-phosphothreonine (1:300), anti-FADD (1:250), and anti-c-FLIP NF6 (1:10). The membranes were washed in Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20 and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies diluted in Tris-buffered saline, 1% Tween 20: anti-mouse IgG2b-HRP, anti-mouse IgG1-HRP (1:20,000), and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (1:5000). The blots were washed and developed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). CaMK II activity was assayed in cell lysates using CaMK II assay kits following the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology). For transfection, CaMK II cDNA (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 expression vector usingEcoR I and HindIII restriction sites. Transfection of the pcDNA3.1 expression vector containing CaMK II cDNA into glioma cells was accomplished using the LipofectAMINE method following the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After transfected for 48 h, the cells were subjected to cell death assay and Western blot analysis for cleavage of caspases and DFF45. Malignant glioma cells express cell surface Fas and are susceptible to agonistic Fas antibody-induced apoptosis (31Weller M. Frei K. Groscurth P. Krammer P.H. Yonekawa Y. Fontana A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). To illustrate the signal events in Fas-mediated apoptosis, we first analyzed the Fas-mediated DISC in sensitive glioma cells. Three glioma cell lines (U343MG, LN-18, T98G) were selected in the study for their expression of cell surface Fas, as shown by flow cytometry, and sensitivity to agonistic Fas antibody CH-11, as determined by crystal violet assay (data not shown). We stimulated these cells with 1 μg/ml CH-11 (mouse IgM) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the Fas-mediated DISC was immunoprecipitated using goat anti-mouse IgM-agarose and examined by Western blotting to identify the proteins that are incorporated into the Fas-mediated DISC. In unstimulated controls, cells were lysed, and CH-11 was then added to the lysates to immunoprecipitate unstimulated Fas. Total cell protein extracts from unstimulated cells were also included in the Western blot analysis to examine endogenous expression of the proteins. Western blots detected one p45 protein band of Fas, one p25 protein band of FADD, four protein bands of caspase-8, and four protein bands of caspase-10 in the Fas-mediated DISC in CH-11 stimulated cells (Fig.1 A). Two caspase-8 precursor proteins (p55 and p53) were detected in both the cell extracts and the DISC, but two caspase-8 first-step cleavage products (p43 and p41) were detected only in the DISC. Similarly, two caspase-10 precursor proteins (p59 and p54) and two caspase-10 first-step cleavage products (p47 and p43) were detected in the DISC. Next we examined the Fas-medicated DISC to look for the other two DED-containing proteins; c-FLIP and phosphoprotein enriched in diabetes/phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes-M r 15 (PED/PEA-15) (36Condorelli G. Vigliotta G. Iavarone C. Caruso M. Tocchetti C.G. Andreozzi F. Cafieri A. Tecce M.F. Formisano P. Beguinot L. Beguinot F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3858-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The long form p55 c-FLIPL and the short form p25 c-FLIPSwere endogenously expressed in the cells as shown by Western blot analysis of the cell extracts (Fig. 1 A), but they were not detected in the Fas-mediated DISC in these CH-11-sensitive cells (Fig.1 A). PED/PEA-15 was reported to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis (39Condorelli G. Vigliotta G. Cafieri A. Trencia A. Andalò P. Oriente F. Miele C. Caruso M. Formisano P. Beguinot F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4409-4415Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 40Estellés A. Charlton D.A. Blau H.M. Dev. Biol. 1999; 216: 16-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Western blots failed to detect PED/PEA-15 in the Fas-mediated DISC in these sensitive glioma cells (Fig.1 A). Caspase-8 cleavage occurs in two consecutive steps in Fas-mediated DISC, first-step cleavage to produce p12, p43, and p41 subunits and second-step cleavage to generate prodomain and active p18 and p10 subunits (41Medema J.P. Scaffidi C. Kischkel F.C. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar) to cleave downstream caspase-3 p32 precursors into large p20 and p17 and small p10 subunits (42Samali A. Cai J. Zhivotovsky B. Jones D.P. Orrenius S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2040-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To examine this caspase-8-initiated cascade, we analyzed cell extracts collected from the cells exposed to 1 μg/ml CH-11 to look for cleavage products. Western blots detected caspase-8 first-step cleavage p43 and p41 products within 30 min and second-step cleavage p18 proteins within 60 min after CH-11 stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Western blots also detected caspase-3 cleavage p20 and p17 subunits after CH-11 stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Finally, we examined the cell extracts for cleavage products of DFF45, a caspase-3 downstream substrate (15Liu X. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 89: 175-184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar, 43Gu J. Dong R.-P. Zhang C. McLaughlin D.F. We M.X. Schlossman S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20759-20762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Two forms of DFF45, the long form DFF45 and the short form DFF35, were endogenously expressed in the glioma cells and proteolytically cleaved upon CH-11 stimulation (Fig.1 B). Many glioma cell lines express cell surface Fas yet are resistant to CH-11 and soluble FasL (31Weller M. Frei K. Groscurth P. Krammer P.H. Yonekawa Y. Fontana A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 954-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 37Hao C. Beguinot F. Condorelli G. Trencia A. Van Meir E.G. Yong V.W. Parney I.F. Roa W.H. Petruk K.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1162-1170PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate molecular mechanisms of this resistance, we analyzed Fas-mediated DISC in three glioma cell lines (LN-215, LN-443, LN-464) that express Fas but are resistant to CH-11 (data not shown). In the cells stimulated with 1 μg/ml CH-11, Western blots detected one p45 Fas band, one p25 FADD band, and four caspase-8 bands, p55 and p53 caspase-8 precursors and p43 and p41 caspase-8 first-step cleavage products (Fig. 2 A). These findings indicated that FADD and caspase-8 are recruited to the Fas-medicated DISC, where caspase-8 completes its first-step cleavage. However, Western blot analysis failed to show caspase-8 second-step cleavage products in these resistant cells treated with CH-11 (Fig.2 B), indicating that caspase-8 second-step cleavage is inhibited in the DISC. Western blots also failed to detect caspase-3 and DFF45 cleavage products (Fig. 2 B), which indicated that caspase-8-initiated cascade is inhibited as well in the resistant cells. Neither caspase-10 precursors nor its cleavage products was detected in the Fas-mediated DISC (data not shown) due to the lower levels of caspase-10 expression in these cells, as we previously reported (38Xiao C. Yang B.F. Asadi N. Beguinot F. Hao C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25020-25025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We further examined the Fas-medicated DISC to look for c-FLIP and PED/PEA-15. The long form p55 c-FLIPL and the short form p25 c-FLIPS were endogenously expressed in these glioma cells (Fig. 2 A). However, Western blot analysis of the DISC revealed three forms of c-FLIP proteins, a very weak band of p55 c-FLIPL, a new band of p43 c-FLIP, and a band of p25 c-FLIPS (Fig. 2 A). These findings indicated that c-FLIPL is recruited to the DISC and cleaved into an intermediate p43 form, as previously reported in c-FLIP transfectants (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P.

Caspase-8 first-step cleavage occurred in both CH-11-sensitive and -resistant glioma cells (Figs. 1 A and2 A), but it appeared that only resistant cells showed simultaneous recruitment of caspase-8 and c-FLIPL to the DISC, resulting in c-FLIPL cleavage into a p43 intermediate form (Fig. 2 A). To further confirm this, we examined c-FLIPL cleavage in the sensitive and resistant cell lines. Indeed, Western blots detected p43 intermediate products in the resistant cells (LN-215, LN-443, LN-464) but not in the sensitive cells (U343MG, LN-18, T98G) after exposure to 1 μg/ml CH-11 (Fig.2 C).

N-Acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) is the first committed intermediate in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway; thus, the mechanisms that control intracellular ManNAc levels are important regulators of sialic acid production. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase and GlcNAc 2-epimerase are two enzymes capable of generating ManNAc from UDP-GlcNAc and GlcNAc, respectively. Whereas the former enzyme has been shown to direct metabolic flux toward sialic acid in vivo, the function of the latter enzyme is unclear.

A key tool we developed for this study is a cell-permeable, small molecule inhibitor of GlcNAc 2-epimerase designed based on mechanistic principles. Our results indicate that, unlike UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, which promotes biosynthesis of sialic acid, GlcNAc 2-epimerase can serve a catabolic role, diverting metabolic flux away from the sialic acid pathway.

Of the nine monosaccharides that constitute mammalian polysaccharides, the common terminal residue sialic acid stands out as a major determinant of cell-cell interactions. Sialic acid is a component of sialyl Lewis x, a tetrasaccharide that binds the selectin family of adhesion molecules and initiates inflammatory leukocyte adhesion (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Google Scholar). Sialic acid is also the major binding determinant of Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamilylectins), a family of sialic acid-binding lectins that are involved in many processes including B-cell signaling and activation (6Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunol. 2001; 103: 137-145Google Scholar).Because of the prominent role of sialic acid in cell surface recognition, there is considerable interest in the regulatory mechanisms that control its biosynthesis and presentation on the cell surface (Fig. 1) (7Keppler O.T. Horstkorte R. Pawlita M. Schmidt C. Reutter W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 11R-18RGoogle Scholar). The first committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of sialic acid is N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc),1 which is phosphorylated by ManNAc 6-kinase (8Stäsche R. Hinderlich S. Weise C. Effertz K.

After transport into the Golgi compartment, the sialyltransferases utilize this substrate to sialylate the terminal position of oligosaccharide chains. Transcriptional regulation of sialyltransferases is one mechanism for controlling the production of certain sialylated epitopes such as polysialic acid (13Troy II, F.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Google Scholar), sialyl Lewis x (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Google Scholar), and α-2,6-linked sialyllactosamine (6Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunol. 2001; 103: 137-145Google Scholar).The overall production of sialic acid in mammalian cells appears to be regulated by the availability of ManNAc, which, in principle, can be synthesized through two possible routes. UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2-epimerase (Fig.1) catalyzes the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and has been implicated as a major source of ManNAc in mammalian cells (14Kikuchi K.

Shindo S. Kobayashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 348-353Google Scholar). However, GlcNAc is thermodynamically favored with an equilibrium ratio of 3.9:1 (21Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 261-277Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that GlcNAc 2-epimerase functions to divert ManNAc away from sialic acid biosynthesis and into other glycosylation or glycolytic pathways. Additionally, human GlcNAc 2-epimerase binds the protease renin (22Takahashi S. Inoue H. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13007-13013Google Scholar), but as of yet no functional significance for this interaction has been demonstrated (23Schmitz C. Gotthardt M. Hinderlich S. Leheste J.R. Gross V. Vorum H. Christensen E.I. Luft F.C. Takahashi S. Willnow T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15357-15362Google Scholar). In summary, the role of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase in the biosynthesis of sialic acid has been clearly established, but the cellular role of GlcNAc 2-epimerase remains unclear.Northern analysis of the mRNAs encoding these epimerases has revealed some differences in their tissue distribution in mice. UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase is highly expressed in the liver (9Lucka L. Krause M. Danker K. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 341-344Google Scholar, 24Horstkorte R. Nöhring S. Wiechens N. Schwarzkopf M. Danker K. Reutter W. Lucka L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 923-927Google Scholar), whereas GlcNAc 2-epimerase is highly expressed in the kidney (23Schmitz C. Gotthardt M. Hinderlich S. Leheste J.R. Gross V. Vorum H. Christensen E.I. Luft F.C. Takahashi S. Willnow T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15357-15362Google Scholar). The enzymes do appear to have some overlapping tissue distribution, however, suggesting either that one enzyme is redundant or the functions they perform are distinct.To investigate the function of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in cells, we identified a cell line lacking the enzyme, introduced the gene into these cells, and studied the effects of GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression on sialic acid biosynthetic flux. We found that GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression suppressed sialic acid production in response to the exogenous addition of ManNAc or ManNAc analogs. Furthermore, guided by a proposed chemical mechanism (21Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 261-277Google Scholar), we prepared two novel substrate-based inhibitors of GlcNAc 2-epimerase and demonstrated that one of these inhibitors functions within cells to block the action of the enzyme. Using the inhibitor as a tool, we confirmed that the phenotype resulting from GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression was indeed due to direct action of the enzyme. Based on these data, we propose that GlcNAc 2-epimerase plays a catabolic role in sialic acid metabolism.DISCUSSIONTo investigate the effect of GlcNAc 2-epimerase on intracellular metabolic flux within the sialic acid pathway, we initially analyzed cell surface sialic acid expression. Sialic acid-binding lectins revealed little about the changes in sialic acid metabolism resulting from GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression in Jurkat cells. However, we were able to observe an effect on sialic acid biosynthesis by using unnatural metabolic substrates and by measurements of intracellular sialic acid levels.G2E* cells, which express GlcNAc 2-epimerase, were unable to convert two unnatural ManNAc analogs (Ac4ManLev and Ac4ManNAz) to the corresponding sialosides (SiaLev and SiaNAz) at levels comparable with wt* cells. This observation is consistent with epimerization of the ManNAc analogs to the corresponding GlcNAc analogs and, consequently, diversion from the sialic acid pathway. GlcNAc derivatives that are produced in this fashion could be utilized in other metabolic pathways that do not contribute to cell surface fluorescence, or they may be dead end biosynthetic intermediates. This model for the effect of GlcNAc 2-epimerase on sialic acid biosynthesis is summarized in Fig.10 A.Figure 10Possible mechanisms for reduced sialic acid biosynthetic flux in G2E* compared with wt* cells. A, GlcNAc 2-epimerase converts ManNAc (and ManNAc analogs) into GlcNAc (and GlcNAc analogs), decreasing the production of natural and unnatural sialic acids. B, GlcNAc 2-epimerase increases ManNAc production, which competes with unnatural ManNAc in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Alternatively, it may be possible that G2E* cells produce higher levels of ManNAc than wt* cells due to epimerization of GlcNAc, a model summarized in Fig. 10 B. Indeed, ManLev was previously used by our laboratory as a tool to select a Jurkat cell line containing mutations in the UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase gene that make the protein resistant to inhibition by CMP-sialic acid (28Yarema K.J. Goon S. Bertozzi C.R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 553-558Google Scholar). Lacking that regulatory mechanism, these cells overproduced ManNAc, which suppressed unnatural sialic acid expression by direct competition with ManLev. The models shown in Fig. 10 are not mutually exclusive; GlcNAc 2-epimerase may perform either of these functions depending on the relative availabilities of GlcNAc and ManNAc in the cell.GlcNAc 2-epimerase is clearly capable of converting ManNAz and ManLev to their gluco counterparts in vitro. The superior efficiency of ManNAz epimerization in vitro is consistent with the dramatic effect of epimerase expression on SiaNAz biosynthesis in cells. Furthermore, intracellular sialic acid levels are reduced in cells expressing GlcNAc 2-epimerase, an effect that cannot be reversed by the addition of exogenous GlcNAc. Collectively, these data support the first model (Fig. 10 A), in which GlcNAc 2-epimerase converts ManNAc and its analogs to the respectivegluco isomers. In the case of the second model (Fig.10 B), epimerase expression would be expected to boost intracellular sialic acid levels in the presence of excess GlcNAc. Furthermore, the conversion of ManNAz to SiaNAz would be suppressed to a lesser extent than the conversion of ManLev to SiaLev, since ManNAz is a more capable competitor with ManNAc in the sialic acid pathway (30Saxon E. Luchansky S.J. Hang H.C. Yu C. Lee S.C. Bertozzi C.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14893-14902Google Scholar). The data presented show the opposite effects, arguing against the second model.To confirm that GlcNAc 2-epimerase was the causative agent of the observed changes in sialic acid biosynthesis in G2E* cells, we designed a family of inhibitors (compounds 1–3) based on a proposed chemical mechanism of the enzyme (21Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 261-277Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). TheK I values of compounds 1 and 2(90 and 109 μm, respectively) were ∼40-fold lower than the measured K m value for ManNAc (4.3 mm) and 200-fold lower than the reportedK m value for GlcNAc (21.3 mm) (20Takahashi S. Takahashi K. Kaneko T. Ogasawara H. Shindo S. Kobayashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 348-353Google Scholar). Since the inhibitors were designed to mimic the ring-opened form of GlcNAc, this lends support to the proposed mechanism in Fig.6 A. The hydrophilicity of compounds 1 and2 would probably frustrate their activity in cell culture experiments. However, compound 3, a peracetylated analog of2, demonstrated inhibitory activity in cells at micromolar concentrations.Introduction of compound 3 into G2E* cells in the presence of Ac4ManLev resulted in a reversal of the phenotype attributed to GlcNAc 2-epimerase, indicating that the action of the enzyme was indeed responsible for the low cell surface expression of unnatural sialic acids (Fig. 8). Additionally, unnatural sialic acid expression in wt* cells was essentially unaltered in the presence of compound 3, indicating that the inhibitor does not cross-react with other proteins in the cell that affect sialic acid biosynthesis. The low intracellular sialic acid level maintained by G2E* cells was increased by compound 3, suggesting again that the inhibitor can reverse the phenotype associated with GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression.It is possible that the primary function of GlcNAc 2-epimerase is to divert metabolic flux from sialic acid biosynthesis into other pathways reliant on GlcNAc or UDP-GlcNAc. Numerous glycoproteins and proteoglycans include GlcNAc as a component, and several cytosolic and nuclear proteins are modified with β-O-GlcNAc in a possible regulatory fashion (47Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Google Scholar, 48Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Google Scholar). Increases in cellular GlcNAc may affect the flux in these pathways. Alternatively, phosphorylation of GlcNAc followed by deacetylation of GlcNAc 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate generates a substrate for glycolysis (38$$Google Scholar). It is possible that GlcNAc 2-epimerase serves to increase glycolytic flux at the expense of protein glycosylation.We conclude that GlcNAc 2-epimerase catalyzes the conversion of ManNAc (and ManNAc analogs) to GlcNAc (and GlcNAc analogs) in human cells, but the reverse process is unobservable, even in the presence of added GlcNAc. Furthermore, analogs of the ring-opened form of GlcNAc are effective inhibitors of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in vitro, lending support to a proposed chemical mechanism. One of these inhibitors reversed the sialic acid suppression induced by GlcNAc 2-epimerase, confirming that the phenotype observed was directly attributable to activity of the enzyme and demonstrating the utility of the inhibitor in human cells. Based on the results presented here, we propose that GlcNAc 2-epimerase is not an alternate route to ManNAc production in cells. Rather, the enzyme diverts metabolic flux away from sialic acid biosynthesis, performing a function distinct from that of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase. Carbohydrate-receptor interactions participate in numerous cell-cell recognition events in eukaryotes (1Brockhausen I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 67-95Google Scholar, 2Blackhall F.H. Merry C.L.R. Davies E.J. Jayson G.C. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 1094-1098Google Scholar, 3Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Google Scholar, 4Varki A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 97-130Google Scholar). Of the nine monosaccharides that constitute mammalian polysaccharides, the common terminal residue sialic acid stands out as a major determinant of cell-cell interactions. Sialic acid is a component of sialyl Lewis x, a tetrasaccharide that binds the selectin family of adhesion molecules and initiates inflammatory leukocyte adhesion (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Google Scholar). Sialic acid is also the major binding determinant of Siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin superfamilylectins), a family of sialic acid-binding lectins that are involved in many processes including B-cell signaling and activation (6Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunol. 2001; 103: 137-145Google Scholar). Because of the prominent role of sialic acid in cell surface recognition, there is considerable interest in the regulatory mechanisms that control its biosynthesis and presentation on the cell surface (Fig. 1) (7Keppler O.T. Horstkorte R. Pawlita M. Schmidt C. Reutter W. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 11R-18RGoogle Scholar). The first committed intermediate in the biosynthesis of sialic acid is N-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc),1 which is phosphorylated by ManNAc 6-kinase (8Stäsche R. Hinderlich S. Weise C. Effertz K. Lucka L. Moormann P. Reutter W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24319-24324Google Scholar, 9Lucka L. Krause M. Danker K. Reutter W. Horstkorte R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 341-344Google Scholar) to initiate sialic acid biosynthesis in the cytosol. The subsequent action of sialic acid synthase (10Lawrence S.M. Huddleston K.A. Pitts L.R. Nguyen N. Lee Y.C. Vann W.F. Coleman T.A. Betenbaugh M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17869-17877Google Scholar), followed by an unknown phosphatase, yields sialic acid, which is then transformed into CMP-sialic acid by CMP-sialic acid synthetase in the nucleus (11Münster A.K. Eckhardt M. Potvin B. Mühlenhoff M. Stanley P. Gerardy-Schahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9140-9145Google Scholar, 12Lawrence S.M. Huddleston K.A. Tomiya N. Nguyen N. Lee Y.C. Vann W.F. Coleman T.A. Betenbaugh M.J. Glycoconj. J. 2001; 18: 205-213Google Scholar). After transport into the Golgi compartment, the sialyltransferases utilize this substrate to sialylate the terminal position of oligosaccharide chains. Transcriptional regulation of sialyltransferases is one mechanism for controlling the production of certain sialylated epitopes such as polysialic acid (13Troy II, F.A. Glycobiology. 1992; 2: 5-23Google Scholar), sialyl Lewis x (5Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Google Scholar), and α-2,6-linked sialyllactosamine (6Crocker P.R. Varki A. Immunol. 2001; 103: 137-145Google Scholar). The overall production of sialic acid in mammalian cells appears to be regulated by the availability of ManNAc, which, in principle, can be synthesized through two possible routes. UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) 2-epimerase (Fig.1) catalyzes the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc to ManNAc and has been implicated as a major source of ManNAc in mammalian cells (14Kikuchi K. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 327: 193-206Google Scholar, 15Keppler O.T. Hinderlich S. Langner J. Schwartz-Albiez R. Reutter W. Pawlita M.

A. 2002; 99: 5267-5270Google Scholar). High levels of CMP-sialic acid inhibit UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase, thereby reducing flux in the sialic acid biosynthetic pathway (17Sommar K.M. Ellis D.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 268: 581-589Google Scholar). A second enzyme, GlcNAc 2-epimerase, can also produce ManNAc by catalyzing the reversible epimerization of GlcNAc to ManNAc (18Ghosh S. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 1531-1536Google Scholar, 19Maru I. Ohta Y. Murata K. Tsukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16294-16299Google Scholar, 20Takahashi S. Takahashi K. Kaneko T. Ogasawara H. Shindo S. Kobayashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 348-353Google Scholar). However, GlcNAc is thermodynamically favored with an equilibrium ratio of 3.9:1 (21Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 261-277Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that GlcNAc 2-epimerase functions to divert ManNAc away from sialic acid biosynthesis and into other glycosylation or glycolytic pathways. Additionally, human GlcNAc 2-epimerase binds the protease renin (22Takahashi S. Inoue H. Miyake Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13007-13013Google Scholar), but as of yet no functional significance for this interaction has been demonstrated (23Schmitz C. Gotthardt M. Hinderlich S. Leheste J.R. Gross V.

To confirm that GlcNAc 2-epimerase was the causative agent of the observed changes in sialic acid biosynthesis in G2E* cells, we designed a family of inhibitors (compounds 1–3) based on a proposed chemical mechanism of the enzyme (21Samuel J. Tanner M.E. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 261-277Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). TheK I values of compounds 1 and 2(90 and 109 μm, respectively) were ∼40-fold lower than the measured K m value for ManNAc (4.3 mm) and 200-fold lower than the reportedK m value for GlcNAc (21.3 mm) (20Takahashi S. Takahashi K. Kaneko T. Ogasawara H. Shindo S. Kobayashi M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 348-353Google Scholar). Since the inhibitors were designed to mimic the ring-opened form of GlcNAc, this lends support to the proposed mechanism in Fig.6 A. The hydrophilicity of compounds 1 and2 would probably frustrate their activity in cell culture experiments. However, compound 3, a peracetylated analog of2, demonstrated inhibitory activity in cells at micromolar concentrations. Introduction of compound 3 into G2E* cells in the presence of Ac4ManLev resulted in a reversal of the phenotype attributed to GlcNAc 2-epimerase, indicating that the action of the enzyme was indeed responsible for the low cell surface expression of unnatural sialic acids (Fig. 8). Additionally, unnatural sialic acid expression in wt* cells was essentially unaltered in the presence of compound 3, indicating that the inhibitor does not cross-react with other proteins in the cell that affect sialic acid biosynthesis. The low intracellular sialic acid level maintained by G2E* cells was increased by compound 3, suggesting again that the inhibitor can reverse the phenotype associated with GlcNAc 2-epimerase expression. It is possible that the primary function of GlcNAc 2-epimerase is to divert metabolic flux from sialic acid biosynthesis into other pathways reliant on GlcNAc or UDP-GlcNAc. Numerous glycoproteins and proteoglycans include GlcNAc as a component, and several cytosolic and nuclear proteins are modified with β-O-GlcNAc in a possible regulatory fashion (47Torres C.R. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3308-3317Google Scholar, 48Wells L. Vosseller K. Hart G.W. Science. 2001; 291: 2376-2378Google Scholar). Increases in cellular GlcNAc may affect the flux in these pathways. Alternatively, phosphorylation of GlcNAc followed by deacetylation of GlcNAc 6-phosphate to glucosamine 6-phosphate generates a substrate for glycolysis (38$$Google Scholar). It is possible that GlcNAc 2-epimerase serves to increase glycolytic flux at the expense of protein glycosylation. We conclude that GlcNAc 2-epimerase catalyzes the conversion of ManNAc (and ManNAc analogs) to GlcNAc (and GlcNAc analogs) in human cells, but the reverse process is unobservable, even in the presence of added GlcNAc. Furthermore, analogs of the ring-opened form of GlcNAc are effective inhibitors of GlcNAc 2-epimerase in vitro, lending support to a proposed chemical mechanism. One of these inhibitors reversed the sialic acid suppression induced by GlcNAc 2-epimerase, confirming that the phenotype observed was directly attributable to activity of the enzyme and demonstrating the utility of the inhibitor in human cells. Based on the results presented here, we propose that GlcNAc 2-epimerase is not an alternate route to ManNAc production in cells. Rather, the enzyme diverts metabolic flux away from sialic acid biosynthesis, performing a function distinct from that of UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase.

Previous work suggested that molecular size and ionization could be important parameters. In this study, we compared the relative sensitivity of isogenic PDR5 and pdr5 strains toward putative substrates that are similar in chemical structure. Three series were used: imidazole-containing compounds, trialkyltin chlorides, and tetraalkyltin compounds. We demonstrate that the Pdr5p transporter is capable of mediating transport of substrates that neither ionize nor have electron pair donors and that are much simpler in structure than those transported by the human MDR1-encoded P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, the size of the substrate is critical and independent of any requirement for hydrophobicity. Substrates have surface volumes greater than 90 Å3 with an optimum response at ∼200–225 Å3 as determined by molecular modeling. Assays measuring the efflux from cells of [3H]chloramphenicol and [3H]tritylimidazole were used. A concentration-dependent inhibition of chloramphenicol transport was observed with imidazole derivatives but not with either the organotin compounds or the antitumor agent doxorubicin. In contrast, several of the organotin compounds were potent inhibitors of tritylimidazole efflux, but the Pdr5p substrate tetrapropyltin was ineffective in both assays. This argues for the existence of at least three substrate-binding sites on Pdr5p that differ in behavior from those of the mammalian P-glycoprotein. Evidence also indicates that some substrates are capable of interacting at more than one site. The surprising observation that Pdr5p mediates resistance to tetraalkyltins suggests that one of the sites might use only hydrophobic interactions to bind substrates.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, broad spectrum resistance to structurally and mechanistically diverse inhibitors is mediated by several members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; P-gp, P-glycoprotein; ClogP, calculated log P; MIC, minimum inhibitory concentration; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, dextrose medium; YPG, yeast extract, peptone, glycerol medium; tritylimidazole, 1-(triphenylmethylimidazole); bifonazole, diphenylbenzylimidazole; clotrimazole, 1[(2-chlorphenyl)diphenylmethyl]imidazole superfamily of transporters, including Pdr5p, a 160-kDa ABC transporter found in the plasma membrane. Pdr5p is essential for basal levels of resistance to a broad array of substrates, including antifungal and antitumor agents, hormones, and ionophores (1Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Google Scholar, 2Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Google Scholar, 3Kolaczkowski M. Vanderest M.

Cell. 1998; 9: 523-543Google Scholar). Compared with isogenic wild-type strains, pdr5 loss-of-function mutants exhibit hypersensitivity because of their inability to efflux inhibitors (3Kolaczkowski M. Vanderest M. Cybularz-Kolaczkowski A. Soumilluion J. Konings W. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31543-31548Google Scholar,5Leonard P. Rathod P. Golin J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2492-2494Google Scholar). Although an important study (3Kolaczkowski M. Vanderest M. Cybularz-Kolaczkowski A. Soumilluion J. Konings W. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31543-31548Google Scholar) provided strong indirect evidence for the existence of more than one substrate-binding site, the chemical basis of Pdr5p substrate specificity is unclear. One reason is that many of the compounds analyzed to date are complex in chemical structure. As an alternative approach, we searched for a series of relatively simple compounds that were systematically related to each other in structure but varied in their ability to serve as Pdr5p substrates. By comparing several series, we hoped to identify shared properties that are used in the Pdr5p-substrate interaction. In the initial study, we compared the relative resistance of isogenicPDR5 (wild-type) and pdr5 (loss-of-function mutant) strains toward a series of tri-n-alkyltin chlorides of increasing alkyl chain length. These compounds are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial ATPases and are not substrates for at least two other major ABC yeast transporters, YOR1 and SNQ2 (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). Initial results suggested that size and ionization might be important factors in Pdr5p-substrate interaction (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). We tested these parameters further by comparing the ability of Pdr5p to mediate resistance to two new series of substrates: nonionizable tetraalkytins and aromatic derivatives of imidazole, a chemical constituent of a number of clinically significant antifungal agents. The backbone structures of these compounds are shown in Fig.1. The simple aromatic imidazole derivatives used in this study differ dramatically in structure from the organotin compounds, but they overlap in size and calculated log P (ClogP) values. Our results show that although ionization is not required for Pdr5p action, molecular size is an important component of Pdr5p-substrate interaction for the three distinct series. Furthermore, some of the features that appear necessary for mammalian P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-substrate interaction, such as multiple electron pair donors (7Seelig A. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 36: 50-54Google Scholar, 8Seelig A. Landwojtowicz E. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 1: 31-40Google Scholar), do not seem to be required for all Pdr5p substrates. Assays using radiolabeled chloramphenicol and tritylimidazole indicate that Pdr5p uses several sites for transporting substrates. Tripropyltin chloride was obtained from Alfa Division (Danvers, MA). Tripentyltin chloride was purchased from Organometallics, Inc. (E. Hampstead, NH). Tetrapropyl, tetrabutyl, and tetrapentyltin chloride were purchased from Gelest (Talleytown, PA). Doxorubicin was purchased from Calbiochem. [3H]Tritylimidazole (25 mCi/mmol) was custom-synthesized by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. (St. Louis, MO) by reduction of clotrimazole (the purity of this compound was 99%). [3H]Chloramphenicol (50 mCi/mmol) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The preparation of yeast extract, peptone, dextrose medium (YPD) and yeast extract, peptone, glycerol medium (YPG) are described elsewhere (1Leppert G. McDevitt R. Falco S.C. Van Dyk T.K. Ficke M.B. Golin J. Genetics. 1990; 125: 13-20Google Scholar). Synthetic dextrose medium containing all of the necessary growth supplements was purchased from Bio 101 (Carlsbad, CA). Tritylimidazole and phenylethylimidazole were synthesized with the procedure of Aldabbagh and Bowman (9Aldabbagh F. Bowman W.R. Tetrahedron. 1999; 55: 4109-4122Google Scholar). The structure of both compounds was verified by using mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. After most of our results were collected, tritylimidazole became commercially available through Sigma-Aldrich. The commercial preparation was compared with our synthesized one in the transport assay described below and gave indistinguishable results. The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I.

Tests of cycloheximide, doxorubicin, and various imidazole derivatives were carried out on YPD plates to which a specific concentration of inhibitor was added after the medium was sterilized. Chloramphenicol and organotin compounds were tested in YPG medium. To determine the MIC of a particular compound for the strains used in this analysis, cells were grown in YPD medium. They were washed in sterile water, and the concentration was adjusted by dilution so that 5 × 104 cells were deposited on plates with a micropipettor in a volume of 10 μl. As the concentration increases and the MIC of a particular compound is approached, cell growth on plates is sometimes diminished, although it remains confluent. The MIC is reported as a range of values. The lower value is the highest concentration tested that allows confluent growth after 72-h incubation at 30 °C on YPD or 96-h incubation on YPG. The higher value is the lowest concentration tested on which no growth is observed under the same conditions. The calculation of ClogP was carried out with a BioByte program (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). Molecular surface volume was calculated with CAChe 4.4 (Fujitsum SBA Tokyo, Beaverton, OR), a computer-aided molecular modeling tool that uses a force field calculation to determine the energy and geometry of a molecule and arrive at its lowest energy confirmation, which is then used to calculate volume. Because of the relatively poor loading of chloramphenicol and its rapid efflux (5Leonard P. Rathod P. Golin J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2492-2494Google Scholar), transport was measured under steady state conditions. Cells were grown overnight in synthetic dextrose medium. They were washed twice with sterile double-deionized water and once with 0.05 m Hepes buffer (pH 7.0) before concentrating to ∼2 × 107cells/100 μl in 0.05 m Hepes (pH 7.0). Aliquots of 125 μl were prepared containing 1.25 × 106 cpm [3H]chloramphenicol made up to 5 μm with cold chloramphenicol. Inhibitors or 100 mm 2-deoxyglucose were introduced, and the samples were incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. We collected 90-μl samples by vacuum filtration on GF/C filters (Whatman International, Maidstone, UK). The filters were washed twice with 10 ml of 0.05 m Hepes buffer before drying and counting in a Beckman LS3801 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman-Coulter, Columbia, MD). [3H]tritylimidazole efflux was analyzed directly by measuring the efflux rather than by using steady state conditions. The cells were loaded for 3 h with the same general protocol described for [3H]chloramphenicol. Following this, samples were chilled on ice for 5 min, centrifuged at 4 °C, and washed once in 1 ml of cold 0.05 m Hepes buffer before resuspension in 250 μl of this buffer containing 1 mm glucose in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Samples were incubated for various times at 30 °C. Following this, 600 μl of cold buffer (pH 7.0) was added, and the samples were placed on ice for 5 min. Because tritylimidazole adheres to filters, the samples were centrifuged at 4 °C and washed once in cold 0.05 m Hepes buffer before resuspension in 125 μl for counting. Under these conditions, background counts averaging ∼2400 cpm were observed. This value was subtracted from the total to calculate the amount of retained tritylimidazole. The trialkyltin chlorides and many substrates mediated by Pdr5p are capable of ionization to varying degrees. Nevertheless, Kolaczkowski et al. (3Kolaczkowski M. Vanderest M. Cybularz-Kolaczkowski A. Soumilluion J. Konings W. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31543-31548Google Scholar) showed that progesterone, with no ionizable groups, is also a Pdr5p substrate. We confirmed the ability of Pdr5p to confer resistance to nonionizing compounds by analyzing three tetraalkyltins: propyl, butyl, and pentyl (the methyl and ethyl derivatives are not toxic in yeast at the highest concentrations that we were able to use). These results are shown in TableII. All three are strong Pdr5p substrates. This was observed by comparing the MICs derived on solid media for isogenic PDR5 and pdr5 strains. The MICs for tetraalkyltins using the PDR5 strain were 10–50-fold higher than the pdr5-null mutant strain JG436. The tetraalkyltins are simple structures without electron pair donors and in this respect are unlike other Pdr5p substrates described to date. Thus, the possibility that the hypersensitivity was caused by a coincidental mutation in another gene rather than in PDR5had to be considered and was investigated by genetic analysis. Theura3, PDR5 (wild-type) strain RW2802 was mated to DYK2.1 (10Katzmann D. Burnett P.E. Golin J. Mahe Y. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4653-4661Google Scholar), which carries a URA3-marked deletion ofPDR5. The resulting diploid was sporulated and subjected to tetrad analysis to determine whether hypersensitivity to tetrabutyltin cosegregated with the URA3 allele. There was complete cosegregation in 17 tetrads scored for these phenotypes. Five petite segregants (mitochondria deficient and unable to grow on glycerol) were not scored. Of the remaining 55 segregants, 29 Ura+ (pdr5) spores were all hypersensitive and failed to grow on plates with 10 mm tetrabutyltin, and the 26 Ura− (PDR5) spores all grew by 96 h of incubation. Therefore, the drug hypersensitivity observed in DYK2.1 is caused by the absence of Pdr5p. This result is further supported by our subsequent observation that the four independent pdr5knockout mutations in our collection are hypersensitive to tetraalkyltin compounds compared with their isogenic controls (data not shown).Table IIRelative resistance of PDR5 and pdr5 strains to substrates: tetraalkyltins, imidazoles, organotin chlorides, and other compoundsCompoundMICaValues are μmexcept for the tetralkyltins, dibutyltin dichloride, phenyl, and benzylimidazole, where concentrations are mm.

Open table in a new tab Table II also includes an analysis of imidazole derivatives and lists the MICs for JG436 and RW2802. To verify that the phenotypic differences observed with JG436 and RW2802 are caused by differences at PDR5, another pair of isogenic strains, SC 4741 (PDR5) and SC2909 (pdr5::gentr), were included in this study (data not shown). With two exceptions noted below, the results with the latter pair of strains were similar or identical to those obtained with JG436 and RW2802. In both pairs of strains, significant differences were observed with some of the aromatic imidazole compounds. Phenyl- and benzylimidazole are weak substrates at best (MIC ratios in both sets of strains are 1–2), but large differences are found with bifonazole, tritylimidazole, and clotrimazole (Table II). MICs were also derived for organotin compounds (Table II), some of which were used in our previous analysis (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). No differences between these strains were observed for trimethyltin chloride, an observation in accord with our initial study (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). The large difference between PDR5 and pdr5strains observed with tripentyltin chloride of ∼200–300-fold was in marked contrast to our initial report of no difference (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). There was no obvious explanation for this other than the fact that the compound used in this study was purchased from a new source and was probably purer than the previous sample. Thin layer chromatography indicated that the new material was ∼97–98% pure, as advertised. 2J. Sczepanski and L. May, unpublished observations. There was a significant difference between the two sets of strains with regard to their relative bifonazole and tricyclohexyltin chloride resistance. With regard to the former, the JG436/RW2802 set gave a difference of ∼80-fold, whereas the difference between SC4741 and SC2909 was only ∼8-fold. Similarly, with tricyclohexyltin chloride, the RW2802/JG436 pair gave an MIC ratio of 50-fold. The SC4741/SC2909 set yielded a ratio of 2. It remains to be determined whether this disparity reflects differences at PDR5 or at some other gene. The effect of single-deletion mutations in SNQ2 andYOR1 on imidazole resistance was investigated in strains that are isogenic to SC4741. We showed previously that the proteins encoded by these genes do not mediate resistance to trialkyltin chlorides (6Golin J. Barkatt A. Cronin S. Eng G. May L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 134-138Google Scholar). We observed no differences in the MICs for any of the imidazoles. Thus, the values obtained for SC4741 are the MICs forsnq2 and yor1 mutants as well. For comparison, data are shown (Table II) for compounds that are either used extensively in the analysis of yeast multidrug resistance (cycloheximide, chloramphenicol) or that are related in structure to members of the organotin series (dibutyltin dichloride and triphenyltin chloride). The data relating substrate efficacy and surface volume are listed in Table III and are illustrated as relative toxicity versus volume plots in Fig.2 for the isogenic RW2802 and JG436 strains. Relative toxicity is represented as a ratio of the MICs for wild type (numerator) and mutant (denominator). There is a strong relationship between substrate efficacy and size as calculated with CAChe 4.4. Compounds smaller than ∼100 Å3 are always poor substrates. As size increases, so does the efficacy, reaching a maximum at ∼200 Å3, although the ratio for tributyltin chloride is unexpectedly low and causes the plot to have a noticeable leveling and perhaps even a dip between ∼145 and 200 Å3. Studies with a reporter plasmid demonstrate that the observed differences are not due to differential induction of PDR5transcription by substrates (data not shown).Table IIIMolecular size, hydrophobicity (ClogP), and substrate efficacyCompoundSurface volumeClogPMIC ratioaThe ratio of wild-type to mutant MIC is listed as the MIC ratio.

Values are obtained from RW2802 (PDR5) and JG436 (pdr5) as described in Table II. Open table in a new tab Inhibitors are listed in ascending order of molecular size. The ClogP and surface volume are calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Evidence strongly indicates that hydrophobicity, as measured by ClogP, is an important property in the interaction between substrates and the mammalian multidrug resistance transporters such as P-gp (7Seelig A. Int. J. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 1998; 36: 50-54Google Scholar, 8Seelig A. Landwojtowicz E. Eur. J. Pharm. Sci. 2000; 1: 31-40Google Scholar). Because hydrophobicity often increases with substrate size, the relationship of these two properties in a series of structurally related compounds is difficult to ascertain. The organotin compounds, however, offered such an opportunity, because it was possible to find examples of similar size and structure but different degrees of hydrophobicity. Thus, tripropyltin chloride and dibutyltin dichloride have surface volumes within 3 Å3 of each other, but their ClogP values differ by an order of magnitude (Table III). The latter is considerably more hydrophilic, because it has an additional polar chlorine group. Nevertheless, the two compounds gave very similar MIC ratios (∼10-fold) between PDR5 and pdr5 strains, suggesting that substrate size is of critical importance and is independent of any hydrophobicity requirement in the interaction of Pdr5p and its substrates. This supposition is reinforced by the observation that the optimal substrates from each of the series (tetraalkyltins, imidazoles, and trialkyltin chlorides) are all in the range of 200–225 Å3, although their ClogP values vary from 4.34 to 10 (Table III). Classic multidrug resistance is often associated with overexpression of ABC transporters. AD124567, a strain that has deletions of five important drug transporters but overproduces Pdr5p because of a PDR1–3 mutation (2Meyers S. Schauer W. Balzi E. Wagner M. Goffeau A. Golin J. Curr. Genet. 1992; 21: 431-436Google Scholar) and is not isogenic to RW2802 was used in our transport assays. Therefore, it was important to determine whether its substrate specificity was different. MICs were derived from AD124567 and the isogenic AD1-7 control stock, which also contains a pdr5deletion. These data are found in TableIV. Efficacy is expressed as in Table II. Not surprisingly, moderate to strong inhibitors (bifonazole, tritylimidazole, clotrimazole, tetrapropyltin, tripropyltin, tributyltin, and tripentyltin chlorides) yielded MICs that were considerably higher in the overproducing strain than in wild-type strains. In contrast, the compounds that gave little or no difference (2-fold or less) in MIC between wild-type and mutant strains also yielded similar MICs when AD1-7 and AD124567 were compared. These observations mean that the conclusions reached with the overexpressing strain should be generally applicable to strains with wild-type levels of Pdr5p. Examination of the MIC ratios for the tri-n-alkyltin chlorides was also instructive. Unlike the case for the wild-type strains, RW2802 and SC4741, the ratio increased steadily as the number of carbons increased. The data also indicated that the MICs derived for the organotin chlorides in the multiple ABC transporter deletion strain AD1-7 were similar to singlepdr5-null mutants. Therefore, other ABC loci are not major mediators of resistance to these compounds.Table IVSpecificity of PDR5-overexpressing strain AD124567CompoundMICaAll of the compounds have MICs expressed as μm concentrations except for phenyl- and benzylimidazole, whose MICs are given in mmconcentrations.A/BAD124567 (A)AD1–7 (B)Aromatic imidazoles1-Phenylimidazole0.60–0.800.20–0.4021-Benzylimidazole2.5–5.01.25–2.521-Phenylethylimidazole>121.9–2.9>4Bifonazole1900–3800<12>316Tritylimidazole>80<0.08>1000Clotrimazole>240.02–0.03>800Organotin compoundsTetrapropyltin3.4–6.80.04–0.07100Trimethyltin chloride0.16–0.320.16–0.321Tripropyltin chloride4.8–9.60.24–0.4820Tributyltin chloride6.4–12.80.04–0.08160Tripentyltin chloride>20001.0>2000Dibutyltin dichloride>20.10–0.15>13a All of the compounds have MICs expressed as μm concentrations except for phenyl- and benzylimidazole, whose MICs are given in mmconcentrations. Open table in a new tab In a previous study (5Leonard P. Rathod P. Golin J. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 2492-2494Google Scholar), we used a pulse-chase experiment to demonstrate that apdr5::URA3 strain has reduced [3H]chloramphenicol efflux compared with an isogenic wild-type control. Most efflux occurs within 5 min. The null mutant strain also accumulates more [3H]chloramphenicol under steady state conditions. Because the hyperresistant strain AD124567 effluxes drug at an even faster rate than the wild-type strain used in the original study, 3J. Golin, unpublished observations. we decided to employ steady state conditions. The assumption that the steady state difference between the strains in chloramphenicol accumulation reflects Pdr5p efflux was confirmed in the experiment illustrated in Fig 3 A, where accumulation is plotted as a function of substrate concentration in both the PDR5 overproducer and its isogenic pdr5counterpart, AD1-7. Although the former accumulated 2–3-fold less substrate, both strains exhibit uptake that is linear and unsaturable. This indicated that influx is not carrier-dependent. Furthermore, the addition of 100 mm 2-deoxyglucose to assays with the overproducing strain resulted in kinetics that were indistinguishable from those obtained with the pdr5 mutant. The addition of this inhibitor to pdr5 mutant cultures, however, did not change the retention kinetics. Thus, the observed difference between the two strains was the result of energy-driven Pdr5p-mediated efflux. To determine whether the imidazole derivatives and the organotin compounds are competitive inhibitors of Pdr5p-mediated chloramphenicol efflux, the transport assay described under “Experimental Procedures” was performed in the presence of clotrimazole, tritylimidazole, tripentyltin chloride, tributyltin chloride, tricyclo"

In humans this protein protects the integrity of the genome, but it also contributes to the resistance of tumors to DNA-alkylating chemotherapeutic agents. Here we report properties of the interaction between AGT and short DNA oligonucleotides. We show that although AGT sediments as a monomer in the absence of DNA, it binds cooperatively to both single-stranded and double-stranded deoxyribonucleotides. This strong cooperative interaction is only slightly perturbed by active site mutation of AGT or by alkylation of either AGT or DNA. The stoichiometry of complex formation with 16-mer oligonucleotides, assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, is 4:1 on single-stranded and duplex DNA and is unchanged by several active site mutations or by protein or DNA alkylation. These results have significant implications for the mechanisms by which AGT locates and interacts with repairable alkyl lesions to effect DNA repair.

These results have significant implications for the mechanisms by which AGT locates and interacts with repairable alkyl lesions to effect DNA repair. human AGT O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase dithiothreitol O 6-Alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase is a ubiquitous repair protein that plays a vital role in minimizing the mutagenic effects of alkylating agents (1Samson L. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 825-831Google Scholar, 2Sekiguchi M. Nakabeppu Y. Sakumi K. Tuzuki T. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1996; 122: 199-206Google Scholar, 3Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Google Scholar, 4Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 462: 83-100Google Scholar). It catalyzes the stoichiometric transfer of a variety of alkyl substituents from theO 6-position of guanine to an active site cysteine, preventing incorrect base pairing caused by these adducts. More than 100 alkyltransferases are now known, and the crystal structures are available for three family members: the Ada-C protein from Escherichia coli (5Moore M.H. Gulbus J.M. Dodson E.J. Demple B. Moody P.C.E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1495-1501Google Scholar), the human alkyltransferase (hAGT)1 (6Daniels D.S. Tainer J.A. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 151-163Google Scholar), and the protein from the thermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus kodakaraensis (7Hashimoto H. Inoue T. Nishioka M. Fujiwara S. Takagi M. Imanaka T. Kai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 707-716Google Scholar). All of the known alkyltransferases lack the ability to dealkylate themselves, and no dealkylation activity has been found in cell extracts to date. On this basis, it is widely thought that alkyltransferase participates in a single reaction and is then irreversibly inactivated. Given the apparently nonenzymatic nature of the protein, the protection afforded by alkyltransferase is likely to depend on the regulation of its synthesis and degradation and on its ability to efficiently locate repairable lesions throughout the genome. The mechanisms by which AGT interacts with adduct-containing and adduct-free DNAs are poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed to date. In the first, single AGT proteins bind normal and lesion-containing DNA, and the distribution of AGT between normal and lesion sites depends on a difference in binding affinity. This model is consistent with the observation that a single AGT monomer is necessary and sufficient to dealkylate a singleO 6-alkyl guanine adduct within a DNA duplex (3Pegg A.E. Dolan M.E. Moschel R.C. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 51: 167-223Google Scholar). It is supported by the observation that single AGT-DNA complexes are detected by gel shift assay when AGT binds short DNA molecules. These complexes have been interpreted as having a 1:1 AGT:DNA stoichiometry, and the binding affinities have been calculated based on that assumption (8Bender K.B. Federwisch M. Loggen U. Nehls P. Rajewsky M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2087-2094Google Scholar). The second mechanism was proposed when it was found that some AGT-DNA complexes have stoichiometries greater than 1:1 and form without the accumulation of detectable binding intermediates (9Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Google Scholar). This pattern strongly suggests a cooperative binding mechanism for AGT. Here we more thoroughly characterize the cooperative binding mechanism. We show that it functions on both single-stranded and duplex 16-mer DNAs and with unmodified and alkylated hAGTs. In all cases the stoichiometries of hAGT:16-mer complexes were 4:1. In this binding mode, hAGT discriminates poorly between lesion-containing and lesion-free DNA. Together these results support a novel model of binding site search and recognition that involves the cooperative formation and processive movement of multi-protein complexes. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from New England Biolabs, and [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Acrylamide andN,N′-methylene bisacrylamide were purchased from Aldrich. O 6-Methylguanine andO 6-benzylguanine were generously provided by Dr. R. C. Moschel (ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Frederick, MD). Recombinant human AGT (wild type and C145A mutant proteins) were prepared as previously described (10Pegg A.E. Boosalis M. Samson L. Moschel R.C. Byers T.L. Swenn K. Dolan M.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11998-12006Google Scholar). Both of the proteins were homogeneous as judged by electrophoresis (not shown). The wild type protein was 100% active in debenzoylatingO 6-benzylguanine. The C145A mutant lacks the active site cysteine and is not active against alkyl-DNA or alkyl-guanine substrates (11Crone T.M. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4750-4753Google Scholar). The construction of modified pQE-30 vectors encoding C-terminally His6-tagged wild type and C145A and C145S mutant AGT proteins for expression in E. coli was accomplished as described (12Liu H. Xu-Welliver M. Pegg A.E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 452: 1-10Google Scholar). His-tagged proteins were purified from cell lysates using TALON® affinity resin (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) containing 5 mm DTT and stored frozen at −80 °C until needed. Wild type hAGT proteins were alkylated at the active site cysteine by incubation (at 37 °C for 30 min) with either 1 mm O 6-methylguanine or 1 mm O 6-benzylguanine according to Kanugula et al. (13Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 545-550Google Scholar). Alkylation was detected by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometric analysis of trypsin-digested protein, in which the conversion of the fragment containing the active site cysteine (Gly136–Arg147,M predicted = 1314.72,m/z obs = 1315.82) to its methylated derivative (M predicted = 1328.73,m/z obs = 1328.81) or benzoylated derivative (M predicted = 1391.80,m/z obs = 1393.66) was observed. Complete conversion of hAGT to the alkyl form (as monitored by mass spectrometry) eliminated detectable alkyl transferase activity assayed with [3H]methyl calf thymus DNA as substrate (results not shown) (14Xu-Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1936-1945Google Scholar). Human AGT undergoes a conformational change upon alkylation that reduces its in vivo and in vitrohalf-life (13Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Pegg A.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 545-550Google Scholar). Accordingly, the samples were used immediately following alkylation to avoid problems of instability. Human AGT concentrations were measured both with the BCA dye binding assay (15Walker J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 32: 5-8Google Scholar) and spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient, ε280 = 3.93 × 104m−1 cm−1, calculated from data of Roy et al. (16Roy R. Shiota S. Kennel S.J. Raha R. von Wronski M. Brent T.P. Mitra S. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 405-411Google Scholar). The values of ε215/ε280 = 8.2 and ε260/ε280 = 0.63 were obtained from UV spectra of the purified protein dissolved in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.6) at 21 °C. A 16-residue oligodeoxyribonucleotide (sequence 5′-GAC TGA CTG ACT GAC T-3′) and its complement were purchased from Invitrogen. A substrate oligonucleotide with the same sequence and a methyl substitution at theO 6-position of the 3′-most guanine (shown above in bold type) was purchased from Synthegen LLC (Houston, TX). When duplex DNA was required, the oligonucleotide samples were combined and annealed as described (17Kanugula S. Goodtzova K. Edara S. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 7113-7119Google Scholar). The DNA samples were labeled at the 5′ termini with 32P as described by Maxam and Gilbert (18Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 560-565Google Scholar) and transferred into 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0 at 21 °C) using Sephadex G-25 centrifuge columns (Amersham Biosciences). Stock DNA concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically, using ε260 = 1.3 × 104m−1 cm−1 (per base pair) for duplex samples and ε260 = 1.04 × 104m−1 cm−1 (per base) for single-stranded samples. The binding reactions were carried out at 20 ± 1 °C in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, supplemented with NaCl as indicated. Protein-DNA complexes were formed by adding appropriate amounts of hAGT to solutions containing 32P-labeled oligodeoxyribonucleotides. The mixtures were equilibrated at 20 ± 1 °C for 30 min. Duplicate samples incubated for longer periods gave identical results, indicating that equilibrium had been attained. Electrophoresis was performed using 10% polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:N,N′-methylene bisacrylamide = 75:1), cast, and run at 8 V/cm in buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.6) supplemented with NaCl to match the conductivity of the protein-DNA samples. Autoradiograms were obtained with Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film exposed at 4 °C. Gel segments containing individual electrophoretic species were excised using the developed film as a guide and counted in a scintillation counter by the Cerenkov method (20van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985: 51-92Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using scanning densitometry. The serial dilution method (19Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Google Scholar) was used to obtain self-consistent estimates of the binding stoichiometry (n) and the association constant (K a). For a binding mechanism of the type nP + D ⇄P n D, the association constant isK n = [PnD]/[P]n[D]. Separating variables and taking logarithms gives the following equation.ln[PnD][D]=nln[P]+lnKnEquation 1 Dilution of an AGT-DNA mixture changes the binding ratio [PnD]/[D] by mass action. A recursive method (14Xu-Welliver M. Kanugula S. Pegg A.E. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1936-1945Google Scholar) was used to evaluate n and K a, starting with an initial value of n = 4 deduced from the value ofM r (complex) measured by sedimentation equilibrium. In many cases the association constant was also evaluated by direct titration. hAGT protein was directly added to 32P-DNA solutions (typically ∼5 × 10−7m), and the samples were analyzed by native gel electrophoresis. The free protein concentration [P] was estimated using the conservation relation [P] = [P]o − n[PnD] in which [P]o is the total hAGT concentration in the reaction mixture, and an initial value of n = 4 was assumed on the basis of our sedimentation equilibrium results (see Fig.1). For the highly cooperative formation of a 4:1 complex under conditions of large protein excess, the fractional saturationY is given by (20van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ1985: 51-92Google Scholar) the following.Y=[P4D][D]+[P4D]=[P]41/Ka+[P]4Equation 2 Estimates of K a were obtained by fitting Equation 2 to the experimentally determined dependence of Yon [P]. hAGT protein and oligodeoxyribonucleotides were dialyzed against 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl. Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed at 20 ± 0.1 °C in a Beckman XL-A centrifuge using an AN 60 Ti rotor. Scans were obtained at 260 and 280 nm with a step size of 0.001 cm. Equilibrium was considered to be attained when scans made 6 h apart were indistinguishable. Typically, equilibration times ≥24 h met this criterion for AGT-DNA mixtures. Five scans were averaged for each sample at each wavelength and rotor speed. For analysis of hAGT protein alone, models incorporating different assembly stoichiometries were based on the following general equation. A(r)=∑nαnexp[σn(r2−ro2)]+εEquation 3 Here A(r) is the absorbance at radial positionr, and αn is the absorbance of the nth species at the reference radius (r o). The parameter ςn is the reduced molecular weight [ςn =M n(1 −v̄ρ)ω2/(2RT)],M n is the molecular weight of the nth species, v̄ its partial specific volume, ρ is the solvent density, ω is the rotor angular velocity, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and ε is the base-line offset. Solvent density (1.004 g/ml) was measured using a Mettler density meter. The partial specific volume of hAGT (0.744 ml/g) was calculated by the method of Cohn and Edsall (21Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 140-154Google Scholar), using partial specific volumes of amino acids tabulated by Laue et al.(22Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Harding J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). For a system in which hAGT protein is in binding equilibrium with DNA according to the mechanism nP + D ⇄P n D, Equation 3 becomesA(r)=αPexp[σP(r2−ro2)]+αDexp[σD(r2−ro3)]+ αPnDexp[σPnD(r2−ro2)]+εEquation 4 Here, most terms are defined as for Equation 3; αDand αPnD are absorbances of DNA and protein-DNA complex at r o, the reduced molecular weights of DNA and protein-DNA complex are given by ςD =M D(1 −v̄ Dρ)ω2/(2RT) and ςPnD = (nM P +M D)(1 −v̄ PnDρ)ω2/(2RT), and n is the protein:DNA ratio of the complex. In this analysis, the known molecular weights of recombinant hAGT proteins (21,614 ≤ M r ≤ 21,876) and DNA (M r = 4,881 for single-stranded DNA andM r = 9,762 for double-stranded DNA) were used as constants. The partial specific volume of NaDNA at 0.1 mNaCl (0.502 ml/g) was estimated by interpolation of the data of Cohen and Eisenberg (23Cohen G. Eisenberg H. Biopolymers. 1968; 6: 1077-1100Google Scholar). Partial specific volumes of each of protein-DNA complexes were estimated using Equationv¯PnD=(nMPu¯P+MDu¯D)(nMP+MD)Equation 5 Here n is the stoichiometric ratio of protein to DNA in the complex. Equation 5 is based on the assumption that there is no significant change in partial specific volumes of the components upon association. Although we do not know whether such a volume change occurs, it seems reasonable that values ofv̄ PnD for complexes containing a large mass proportion of protein (like those analyzed here) should reflect that proportion. Equation 4 was used in global analysis of multiple data sets obtained at different macromolecular concentrations and/or rotor speeds (24Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Google Scholar). In this method, the values of αP, αD, αPnD, and ε are unique to each sample, but the value of n must be common to all of the data sets. Nonideality was not considered, because there was no evidence of nonideal effects. Solutions containing hAGT protein at two nominal concentrations (3.6 and 13.7 μm) were brought to sedimentation equilibrium at three different centrifuge speeds (22,000, 31,000, and 43,000 rpm). A representative data set for a 13.7 μm sample of His6-tagged C145S hAGT taken at 43,000 rpm and 20 °C is shown in Fig.1 (curve A). The solid line is the result of fitting the single-species version of Equation 3 (n = 1) to the data. This fit returned a value of M r = 21,800 ± 400, which is in excellent agreement with the monomer molecular weight derived from the protein sequence (M r = 21,860). The small, uniformly distributed residuals indicate that the monomer model is consistent with the data over the entire concentration range present in the centrifuge cell. Extension of the model to include oligomers of hAGT (Equation 3 with n > 1 and M n= nM1) did not improve the quality of the fit as judged by the correlation coefficient or by the magnitude of the residuals (result not shown). Similar results were obtained for wild type hAGT (M r = 21,500 ± 200), C145A hAGT (M r = 21,400 ± 200), His6-tagged wild type hAGT (M r = 22,000 ± 500), and His6-tagged C145A hAGT (M r = 21,800 ± 200). These molecular weights agree well with values predicted from protein sequence, consistent with the interpretation that all of the preparations were monomeric within the concentration range tested. Importantly, neither the His6 tag nor the active site mutation C145A changed the monomeric state of free hAGT. As discussed below, hAGT forms oligomeric complexes with DNA. The absence of detectable hAGT oligomers in the absence of DNA demonstrated here argues against models in which protein association precedes DNA binding. Mixtures containing hAGT and single-stranded DNA were brought to sedimentation equilibrium at four different centrifuge speeds (11,000, 15,000, 20,500, and 27,000 rpm). Representative data are shown in Fig. 1(curve B); the solid curve represents the global fit of Equation 4 to the data ensemble. The small, uniformly distributed residuals indicate that the simple mechanism nP+ D ⇄ P n D, withn = 3.98 ± 0.07 is consistent with the data. Sedimentation models with additional species did not fit the data significantly better than Equation 4 (results not shown). This outcome is intriguing because it suggests that then = 4 complex forms without significant accumulation of intermediates of lower stoichiometry. This interpretation is supported by the gel mobility shift experiments described below.

Open table in a new tab Similar experiments were carried out with hAGT and a 16-bp duplex DNA. Samples were brought to sedimentation equilibrium at 11,000, 15,000, 20,500, and 27,000 rpm. Representative data are shown in Fig. 1(curve C); the solid curve represents the global fit of Equation 4 to the data ensemble. As before, the high quality of the fit indicates that the simple mechanism nP +D ⇄ P n D, withn = 3.94 ± 0.08 is consistent with the data. Inclusion of additional species in the sedimentation model did not improve the quality of the fit (results not shown), suggesting that, as with single-stranded DNA, stoichiometric intermediates are not present in significant concentrations. This suggestion is supported by gel shift results (discussed below). The fact that the hAGT stoichiometry is the same, within error, for both single-stranded and duplex 16-mers is intriguing, because it suggests that factors determining stoichiometry may not be sensitive to the association state of the DNA. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (25Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Google Scholar) were performed to explore a range of hAGT and DNA concentrations below those accessible in the analytical ultracentrifuge. The binding of hAGT to DNA produced a single mobility-shifted complex at all protein and DNA concentrations that gave detectable binding (Fig.2 A). This binding pattern is consistent with a mechanism of the type nP + D⇄ P n D in which the maximum stoichiometry (n) is reached without accumulation of significant concentrations of intermediates (19Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Google Scholar). The dependence of ln([PD]/[D]) on ln[P] is shown in Fig. 2 B. The values of stoichiometry and K a were calculated from these data as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The stoichiometry values most consistent with the data for His6-tagged C145S hAGT binding to 16-mer are 3.84 ± 0.2 for single-stranded DNA and 3.99 ± 0.1 for double-stranded DNA. These stoichiometry values (summarized in Table I) agree well with ones obtained by analytical ultracentrifugation, despite a difference in the salt concentration of the buffers used in the two techniques (serial dilution assays, ∼10 mm; sedimentation equilibrium assays, ∼110 mm). Closely similar stoichiometry values were obtained by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay method for the active site mutant C145A hAGT as well as His6-wild type hAGT and His6-C145A hAGT (TableI), supporting the conclusion that neither the C145A modification of the active site nor the presence of a C-terminal His6 tag has a significant effect on the stoichiometry of these interactions. Binding stoichiometries were also measured by the continuous variation (Job plot) method (26Huang C.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 509-525Google Scholar). With the input concentrations of protein and DNA ([P]o + [D]o) held constant, the ratio of [P]o:[D]o that yields the greatest concentration of complex (the optimal combining ratio) is a measure of the association stoichiometry. As shown in Fig.3 and summarized in Table I, this method returns hAGT-DNA stoichiometries close to 4:1, in good agreement with values obtained by the serial dilution and analytical ultracentrifuge methods. Taken with the fact that higher stoichiometry complexes are readily observed with larger DNAs (9Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Google Scholar), 2J. J. Rasimas, unpublished results. the absence of detectable complexes with stoichiometries greater than 4:1, even at high [hAGT], suggests that this stoichiometry represents protein saturation for both single-stranded and duplex 16-mer DNAs. Together, the presence of free DNA in equilibrium with the 4:1 complex and the absence of complexes with protein:DNA ratios <4:1, suggest that hAGT binds cooperatively to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNAs. Because free hAGT is monomeric (Fig. 1), this pattern suggests that the protein assembly forms on DNA and not in free solution prior to DNA binding. Association constants for the interaction of wild type and C145A, His6-wild type, His6 C145A, and His6-C145S hAGTs with single-stranded and duplex 16-mer DNAs were calculated from serial dilution data as described above and were also determined by direct titration of DNA by hAGT (Fig. 4; data summarized in Table I). Measured in these ways, the formation constant (K a) for the complex of wild type protein with single-stranded 16-mer is ∼1.5 × 1023m−4. Assuming equipartition of the binding free energies among the four hAGT monomers, this corresponds to a monomer association constant of ∼6.2 × 105m−1, which is in reasonable agreement with values reported for small (9Fried M.G. Kanugula S. Bromberg J.L. Pegg A.E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15295-15301Google Scholar) and large (27Chan C.Z.W. Ciardelli T. Eastman A. Bresnick E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 300: 193-200Google Scholar) DNA molecules. The very narrow range of association constants for wild type, active site mutant, and His6-tagged hAGT proteins (best seen by comparison of the effective monomer association constants given in Table II) is an especially interesting result. It indicates that neither the C145A mutation of the active site nor the presence of a C-terminal His6 affinity tag signi"

Nab2p is an essential Saccharomyces cerevisiaehnRNP protein that interacts with poly(A) RNA and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Functional Nab2p is required for export of poly(A) RNA from the nucleus. The Nab2 protein consists of the following four domains: a unique N-terminal domain, a glutamine-rich domain, an arginine-glycine (RGG) domain, and a zinc finger domain. We generated Nab2p deletion mutants to analyze the contribution of each domain to the in vivo function of Nab2p. We first tested whether the deletion mutants could replace the essentialNAB2 gene. We then examined the impact of these mutations on Nab2p localization, poly(A) RNA localization, and association of Nab2p with poly(A) RNA. Our analyses revealed that the N-terminal domain is required for nuclear export of both poly(A) RNA and Nab2p. We confirm that the RGG domain is important for Nab2p import in vivo. Finally, the zinc finger domain is critical for the interaction between Nab2p and poly(A) RNA in vivo. Our data support a model where Nab2p associates with poly(A) RNA in the nucleus through the zinc finger domain and facilitates the export of the poly(A) RNA through protein interactions mediated by the N-terminal domain.

This compartmentalization prevents cross-talk between these cellular processes in an inappropriate or unregulated manner. For example, the membrane-bound nucleus serves at least two critical purposes: to sequester and protect the genetic material and to separate the nuclear processes of transcription and pre-mRNA processing from protein translation in the cytoplasm. As a result of this sequestration, the eukaryotic cell has evolved highly regulated mechanisms to actively transport macromolecules into and out of the nucleus (1Quimby B.B. Corbett A.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 2Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 570-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Proteins that function within the nucleus are imported through large proteinaceous nuclear pore complexes that are embedded within the nuclear envelope (3Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16593-16596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Similarly, macromolecules, including mRNP1 complexes, consisting of mRNA and hnRNP proteins, are exported from the nucleus through nuclear pores (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Mature, fully processed mRNAs are selectively exported from the nucleus (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Reed R. Hurt E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Thus, nuclear export of poly(A) RNA is extremely complex because it depends on numerous pre-mRNA processing events that must be completed within the nucleus prior to export (6Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Strahm Y. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nascent transcripts are co-transcriptionally modified by proteins that mediate 5′-capping (7Cramer P. Srebrow A. Kadener S. Werbajh S. de la Mata M. Melen G. Nogues G. Kornblihtt A.R. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), 3′-cleavage, polyadenylation (7Cramer P. Srebrow A. Kadener S. Werbajh S. de la Mata M. Melen G. Nogues G. Kornblihtt A.R.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). During pre-mRNA processing, the maturing mRNAs associate with many heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which may serve as markers for the completion of pre-mRNA processing events (5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Successful completion of these processing steps results in a mature mRNA species that is ready to be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated into protein. Over the course of pre-mRNA processing, some of the hnRNP proteins dissociate from the maturing transcript in the nucleus, whereas others that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) remain associated with the transcript to form an mRNP complex that is exported to the cytoplasm (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 5Reed R. Hurt E.

Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Many transport events, such as classical nuclear protein import, are mediated by a family of conserved transport receptors, known as karyopherins (10Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), that recognize targeting signals within the transport cargo (11Marelli M. Dilworth D.J. Wozniak R.W. Aitchison J.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, mRNA export does not appear to use members from this family of transport receptors (4Lei E.P. Silver P.A. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 261-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Instead, proteins such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mex67p/Mtr2p (TAP/p15 in mammalian cells) specifically associate with mature mRNA and act as poly(A) RNA export factors (5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Strahm Y. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore, the association of mRNA with a combination of hnRNPs and mRNA export factors culminates in the export of mature mRNA transcripts (5Reed R. Hurt E. Cell. 2002; 108: 523-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Zenklusen D. Vinciguerra P. Strahm Y. Stutz F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4219-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The volume, complexity, and timing of proteins that associate with and dissociate from the maturing transcript during the pre-mRNA processing stages make it difficult to simply map the route that mRNA must travel in order to be exported from the nucleus. Unraveling this complexity requires detailed analyses of the proteins within the poly(A) RNA-hnRNP complexes. To this end, we have analyzed the S. cerevisiae hnRNP protein, Nab2p. Nab2p,nuclear abundant poly(A) RNAbinding protein 2, is an essential protein that was identified as a poly(A) RNA-binding protein (12Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As with other shuttling hnRNP proteins (13Kessler M.M. Henry M.F. Shen E. Zhao J. Gross S. Silver P.A. Moore C.L.

Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) but shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (17Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B.

Nab2p is imported into the nucleus by a transport receptor from the karyopherin family, Kap104p (20Aitchison J.D. Blobel G. Rout M.P. Science. 1996; 274: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of Nab2p export is unknown, it relies on ongoing synthesis of poly(A) RNA and the arginine methyltransferase, Hmt1p (17Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Importantly, in the absence of a functional Nab2 protein, poly(A) RNA accumulates within the nucleus (17Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and cells lacking Nab2p accumulate poly(A) RNA with hyperadenylated poly(A) tails suggesting a role for Nab2p in polyadenylation termination (21Hector R.E. Nykamp K.R. Dheur S. Anderson J.T. Non P.J. Urbinati C.R. Wilson S.M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Swanson M.S. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1800-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings support a model where Nab2p plays a role in ensuring proper export of mature mRNA from the nucleus. In support of this model, the Nab2 protein contains domains similar to those found in other proteins that function in RNA metabolism. Nab2p can be divided into four distinct domains: a unique N-terminal domain, a glutamine-rich domain, an RGG (arginine-glycine-glycine) domain, and a seven repeat zinc finger domain encompassing the entire C-terminal half of the protein (see Fig. 1) (12Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The RGG domain is found in many proteins involved in RNA metabolism, including the yeast hnRNPs, Npl3p and Hrp1p, and the mammalian hnRNP A1 protein (12Anderson J.T. Wilson S.M. Datar K.V. Swanson M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2730-2741Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 16Shen E.C. Henry M.F. Weiss V.H. Valentini S.R. Silver P.A. Lee M.S.

This domain also overlaps with the nuclear localization signal/Kap104p-binding site in Nab2p (19Lee D.C. Aitchison J.D. J. Biol.

For this study, we have generated a series of NAB2 mutants, and analyzed these variant proteins to provide insight into the function of each domain. We find that the N-terminal domain is important for efficient export of both Nab2p and poly(A) RNA from the nucleus. The RGG domain of Nab2p is important, but not absolutely required, for import of Nab2p into the nucleus. Finally, the zinc finger domain is essential for Nab2p function, and our results suggest that the last three zinc finger repeats are critical for the interaction with poly(A) RNA in vivo. DNA manipulations were performed according to standard methods (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed.

Proper construction of all mutants was confirmed by sequencing of the resulting clones. The function of each mutant was assessed through a plasmid shuffle technique using 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (33Boeke J.D. Truehart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar). NAB2deletion cells (ACY429) maintained by a wild-typeURA3-NAB2 plasmid (pAC636) and also containing aLEU2 plasmid carrying the mutant allele of NAB2to be tested were grown to saturation, counted, and serially diluted in distilled H2O to obtain 10,000, 1000, 100, 10, or 1 cell per 3 μl. These dilutions were spotted onto URA− glucose and 5-FOA plates and incubated at 37, 30, and 18 °C. Cells expressing wild-type NAB2 or vector alone served as controls. Cultures were grown to saturation (or as indicated) and then harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 3 min. Cell pellets were washed twice with distilled H2O and once in PBSMT (PBS, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5% Triton X-100). Cells were then resuspended in 500 μl of PBSMT supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 3 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin). One volume of glass beads was added to each sample, and cells were lysed with 60-s pulses in a bead beater (Biospec Products). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm and assayed for total protein concentration using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (34Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar). Nab2 protein was detected with a polyclonal anti-Nab2p antibody (1:50,000) (17Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X. Corbett A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7752-7760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); GFP-tagged proteins were detected using a polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (1:5000) (35Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell.

Randazzo P.A. Terui T. Cavenagh M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All microscopy was carried out using filters from Chroma Technology and an Olympus BX60 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a photometrics Quantix digital camera. For direct fluorescence, cells expressing GFP-tagged proteins were grown to 1 × 107 cells per ml, and live cells were then examined for the GFP signal through a GFP optimized filter. All images were captured using IP Lab Spectrum software. Nuclear export of Nab2p was examined as described previously (37Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The wild-type and mutant Nab2-GFP fusion proteins were expressed in nup49-313(ACY480) yeast (38Doye V. Wepf R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6062-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to mid-log phase at 25 °C in minimal media lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% glucose. To inhibit protein synthesis, cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) was added to each sample for 1 h at 25 °C. Cultures were then either maintained at 25 °C or shifted to 37 °C for 5 h. The GFP signal was examined in live cells by direct fluorescence microscopy as described above. The FISH protocol was adapted from Wong and co-workers (39Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 40Amberg D.C. Goldstein A.L. Cole C.N. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1173-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Cells expressing wild-type Nab2p (pAC717), ΔN (pAC1152), ΔQQQP (pAC1115), or ΔRGG (pAC957) as their only copy of NAB2 were grown to log phase at 18, 25, 30, and 37 °C. Cells were fixed in 5.2% formaldehyde (J. T. Baker Inc.) for 90 min, washed twice with 0.1 mpotassium phosphate, and washed once and resuspended in P-solution (0.1m potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 1.2 msorbitol). Samples were then incubated with 25 μmdithiothreitol and digested with 1 mg/ml zymolyase. Cells were applied to Teflon-coated slides (Cell Point) treated with 0.1% polylysine. Cells were subsequently permeabilized for 5 min with 0.5% igepal, equilibrated for 2 min with 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, and incubated for 10 min with 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 8.0, with 0.25% acetic anhydride to block polar groups. The slide was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in prehybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 4× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 125 μg/μl tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 0.5 mg/ml boiled single-stranded DNA). The digoxigenin-labeled oligo(dT)50probe was applied to the wells for overnight incubation at 37 °C. Wells were washed several times with dilutions of SSC (2, 1, and 0.5×) before incubation in antibody blocking buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted 1:200 in antibody blocking buffer and applied to the wells for overnight incubation at room temperature. The wells were washed several times with salt washes (antibody wash 1: 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.0, and 0.15 m NaCl; antibody wash 2: 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2). DAPI was added at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for 1 min. The slides were washed, dried, treated with antifade, and sealed with clear nail polish. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed according to Wong et al. (39Wong D.H. Corbett A.H. Kent H.M. Stewart M. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3755-3767Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to log phase and cells were prepared for immunofluorescence and adhered to slides as described for FISH. Cells were then fixed onto slides by methanol/acetone treatment, blocked with PBS/BSA (1× PBS, 0.5% BSA), and then incubated with an anti-GFP antibody (1:1000) (35Seedorf M. Damelin M. Kahana J. Taura T. Silver P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1547-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) overnight. Samples were subsequently washed with PBS/BSA and incubated with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:1000) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h at room temperature. Samples were washed and stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml). Finally, sample wells were washed several times with PBS, dried, treated with antifade, and sealed. The protocol for UV cross-linking was adapted from Krebber et al. (41Krebber H. Taura T. Lee M.S. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1994-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown to mid-log phase and shifted to 18 °C until cultures reached early saturation. Cell pellets were washed once and resuspended in PBS. Proteins and RNA were cross-linked by UV (λ = 365 nm) irradiating the cells four times for 2.5 min each time using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). Cells were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm LiCl, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, and protease and RNase inhibitors) with glass beads. Samples were vortexed for 20 min at 4 °C to lyse the cells and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. Lysates were incubated with LiCl, oligo(dT) binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.5 mm LiCl), 0.2 g of oligo(dT)25-cellulose (New England Biolabs), and RNase inhibitor (Promega) for 30 min at room temperature. The complexes bound to the oligo(dT)25-cellulose were washed, resuspended in oligo(dT) binding buffer, and poured into a polyprep column (Bio-Rad). Complexes were eluted from the oligo(dT)25-cellulose with elution buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% SDS). The eluate was heated at 65 °C for 10 min, cooled on ice for 10 min, supplemented with 0.5 m LiCl, and loaded back onto the cellulose column. The column was washed with oligo(dT) binding buffer, and complexes were eluted with elution buffer. The eluate was subsequently concentrated by extraction with butanol. The RNA-protein complexes were precipitated with 0.2 m LiCl and 100% ethanol overnight at −80 °C and resuspended in RSB (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors). Units of RNA in each sample were measured atA 260. Samples were treated with RNase and micrococcal nuclease at 30 °C for 30 min. For each sample, 35 units of RNA in gel loading dye was resolved on a SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-Nab2p antibody (1:50,000) (17Green D.M. Marfatia K.A. Crafton E.B. Zhang X. Cheng X.

The amount of protein bound to poly(A) RNA was quantified by fluoroimaging using Labworks software from UVP BioImaging Systems. The amount of protein in the bound and lysate lanes of each immunoblot was quantified using non-linear equations. The background density was subtracted from each lane resulting in a value corresponding to density of total Nab2 protein in each lane. The amount of bound protein was calculated by setting each lysate value to 1. The fold difference in the amount of bound protein for the mutan"

CCK exerts its growth modulatory effects through Gq-coupled receptors (CCKA and CCKB) and activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2). In the present study, we investigated the different mechanisms participating in CCK-induced activation of ERK1/2 in pancreatic AR42J cells expressing both CCKA and CCKB. CCK activated ERK1/2 and Raf-1 to a similar extent as epidermal growth factor (EGF). Inhibition of EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase or expression of dominant-negative Ras reduced CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation, indicating participation of the EGFR and Ras in CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation. However, compared with EGF, CCK caused only small increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and Shc, Shc-Grb2 complex formation, and Ras activation. Signal amplification between Ras and Raf in a CCK-induced ERK cascade appears to be mediated by activation of protein kinase Cε (PKCε), because 1) down-modulation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs inhibited CCK-induced activation of Ras, Raf, and ERK1/2 without influencing Shc-Grb2 complex formation; 2) PKCε, but not PKCα or PKCδ, was detectable in Raf-1 immunoprecipitates, although CCK activated all three PKC isoenzymes. In addition, the present study provides evidence that the Src family tyrosine kinase Yes is activated by CCK and mediates CCK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. Furthermore, we show that CCK-induced activation of the EGFR and Yes is achieved through the CCKB receptor. Together, our data show that different signals emanating from the CCK receptors mediate ERK1/2 activation; activation of Yes and the EGFR mediate Shc-Grb2 recruitment, and activation of PKC, most likely PKCε, augments CCK-stimulated ERK1/2 activation at the Ras/Raf level.

However, down-modulation of PKC by long term treatment with phorbol ester only partially inhibits CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation (28Piiper A. Gebhardt R. Kronenberger B. Giannini C.D. Elez R.

In CCKB-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, the CCKB receptor agonist gastrin activates ERK1/2 by a Shc- and Src-dependent mechanism (32Daulhac L. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Pradayrol L. Vaysse N.

In CCKBreceptor-transfected gastric epithelial cells, gastrin induces EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (33Miyazaki Y. Shinomura Y. Tsutsui S. Zushi S. Higashimoto Y. Kanayama S. Higashiyama S.

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase may represent an additional signaling intermediate in gastrin-induced ERK1/2 activation (34Seva C. Kowalski-Chauvel A. Daulhac L. Barthez C. Vaysse N. Pradayrol L.

Thus, a number of possible signaling intermediates of the Ras-dependent pathway have been assigned to CCK receptor-induced ERK1/2 activation, but it is unclear whether these signaling pathways operate within one cell type and whether cross-talk exists to mediate CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation. In the present study, we sought to delineate the contribution of the EGFR, Src family tyrosine kinases, and PKC as well as their cross-talk in CCK-induced activation of the ERK1/2 pathway in the pancreatic acinar carcinoma cell line AR42J. Our data show that different signals emanating from the CCK receptor cooperate to mediate stimulation of ERK1/2; activation of Yes and the EGFR mediate Shc-Grb2 recruitment and Ras activation, and activation of PKC, most likely PKCε, potentiates ERK1/2 activation at the Ras/Raf level. CCK octapeptide, human recombinant EGF, [Glu52]diphtheria toxin (CRM197), and pertussis toxin were obtained from Sigma. pUSEamp expression vector containing dominant negative Ras (N17Ras), agarose-conjugated Ras-binding domain, and glutathione S-transferase-MEK1 were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum, LipofectAMINE 2000, and penicillin/streptomycin were from Invitrogen. The EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor 4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (AG1478), the PKC inhibitors bisindoylmaleimide (GF109203X), Gö6976 and rottlerin, the Src family kinase inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-methylphenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo-d-3,4-pyrimidine (PP1), 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)etheneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), all dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and gastrin were obtained from Calbiochem. The ERK1/2 activity assay was from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). pEGFP-C1 was from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). The CCKAreceptor antagonist L364,717 and the CCKB receptor antagonist L365,260 were kind gifts of ML Laboratories PLC (Liverpool, UK). Monoclonal anti-β-actin, affinity-purified horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, and anti-sheep IgG were obtained from Sigma. Sheep anti-EGFR used for immunoblotting and polyclonal anti-Shc IgG used for immunoprecipitation, anti-pan-Ras IgG, and agarose-conjugated Ras-binding domain were from Upstate Biotechnology. The antibody against Tyr(P)418-Src was fromBIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). The monoclonal anti-Grb2, anti-Fyn, anti-Yes, anti-PKCα, anti-PKCδ, and anti-PKCε as well as monoclonal anti-Shc IgGs were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The anti-c-Src IgG (clone 327) was obtained from Calbiochem. The antibody raised against dually phosphorylated activated ERK1/2 was from Cell Signaling. Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine, polyclonal goat anti-EGFR and anti-Raf-1 used for immunoprecipitation, rabbit anti-Raf-1 IgG used for reprobing of the immunoblots, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG were from Santa Cruz. Neutralizing and anti-HB-EGF was from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). AR42J cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (36Piiper A. Leser J. Lutz M.P. Beil M. Zeuzem S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 746-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). For transient transfection, cells were cultured in 8-cm2 dishes and transfected with 3 μg of Csk (C-terminalSrc kinase) in pSG5 or pUSEamp containing dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) using LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The efficiency of transfection was monitored by transfecting the cells with a plasmid coding for the green fluorescent protein (pEGFR-C1). Pertussis toxin treatment was carried out by incubating the cells with 200 ng/ml pertussis toxin for 12 h prior to the experiments (28Piiper A. Gebhardt R. Kronenberger B. Giannini C.D. Elez R. Zeuzem S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). AR42J cells were incubated with appropriate agents at 37 °C. At specified times, the incubation was stopped by the addition of lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation and incubated sequentially (2 h for each incubation at 4 °C) with antibodies as indicated and protein A/G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) with gentle agitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled for 3 min in 4× Laemmli sample buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (16Piiper A. Stryjek-Kaminska D. Klengel R. Zeuzem S. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1747-1755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 28Piiper A. Gebhardt R. Kronenberger B. Giannini C.D. Elez R. Zeuzem S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgGs and the enhanced chemiluminescence system. Where appropriate, a 50-μl aliquot of clarified whole-cell lysate was mixed with an equal volume of 4× Laemmli sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE for confirmation of identity of proteins after immunoprecipitation. For reprobing, blots were incubated in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 50 °C for 30 min, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, reblocked as described (28Piiper A. Gebhardt R. Kronenberger B. Giannini C.D. Elez R. Zeuzem S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and reprobed with appropriate antibodies. To determine Src family kinase activity, cell lysates were either subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Src, anti-Yes, or anti-Fyn or directly analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing Tyr(P)418-Src. Tyr418 is an autophosphorylation site and thus reflects activation of Src family kinases (37Kmiecik T.E. Shalloway D. Cell. 1987; 49: 65-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Blots were stripped and reprobed with appropriate antibodies to verify the amount of immunoprecipitated protein. Ras activation was determined by affinity precipitation of activated Ras from cell lysates using agarose-conjugated Ras-binding domain. Cells were stimulated, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in a buffer (Ras lysis buffer) containing 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2% glycerol, and 8 μl of agarose-conjugated Ras-binding domain. After a 30-min incubation at 4 °C, immune complexes were washed three times with Ras lysis buffer, followed by analysis of the immune complexes by anti-Ras immunoblotting. The Raf-1 assay was carried out similarly as described previously (28Piiper A. Gebhardt R. Kronenberger B. Giannini C.D. Elez R. Zeuzem S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 608-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Cells were stimulated and lysed, and Raf-1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Raf-1 antibody as described above in the immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting protocol. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer and once in assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm 2-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The immune complexes were incubated with inactive fusion proteins glutathione S-transferase-MEK1 (0.4 μg) in a buffer containing 15 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 20 mm2-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 μm ATP, and 25 μm MgCl2 in a final volume of 45 μl for 30 min at 30 °C with gentle agitation. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 15 μl of 4× sample buffer, followed by boiling of the samples and SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of MEK1 by immunoprecipitated Raf-1 was determined by immunoblotting with an antibody specific for the phosphorylated form of MEK. The PKC translocation assay was carried out as described recently (38Huwiler A. Fabbro D. Pfeilschifter J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14556-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2 days in serum-free DMEM and stimulated as indicated. Thereafter, cells were washed and scraped into 1 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. Supernatants were used as a source of cytosolic protein. Pellets were resonicated in 1 ml of homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, yielding the solubilized particulate fractions. Protein concentration was determined, and the fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. Results are representative of at least three experiments on different occasions giving similar results. The pancreatic cell line AR42J is a well established model for CCK-induced signaling and expresses both CCKA and CCKB receptors, both of which are activated by CCK and stimulate ERK1/2 by a PKC-dependent mechanism (27Dabrowski A.

CCK activated ERK1/2 with a maximum after 3 min as determined by immunoblotting of cell lysates with an antibody recognizing specifically the dually phosphorylated activated form of ERK1/2 (Fig.1 A). To determine whether the EGFR is involved in CCK-induced activation of ERK1/2, we tested the effect of AG1478, a well established inhibitor of the EGFR tyrosine kinase, on CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation. As shown in Fig. 1,B and C, AG1478 strongly inhibited CCK-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation. AG1478 had no effect on ERK1/2 activation in response to HGF, which activates the c-Met/HGF receptor tyrosine kinase, showing the specificity of this compound for the EGFR tyrosine kinase (Fig. 1 B). AG1478 had only a small if any effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to TPA (Fig.1 D), an activator of PKC. These data indicate that maximal ERK1/2 activation in response to CCK requires EGFR tyrosine kinase, whereas TPA-induced ERK1/2 activation is mainly EGFR-independent in AR42J cells. To differentiate which CCK receptor subtype mediates EGFR tyrosine kinase-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we investigated the effect of AG1478 on ERK1/2 phosphorylation in response to gastrin, which activates only the CCKB receptor. As shown in Fig.1 E, AG1478 strongly inhibited gastrin-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, indicating that ERK1/2 activation in response to CCKB receptor stimulation is EGFR-dependent. Certain GPCRs have been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the EGFR (24Leserer M. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. IUBMB Life. 2000; 49: 405-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 40Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). To investigate if CCK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR, cells were stimulated with CCK or EGF followed by immunoprecipitation of the EGFR and analysis of the immunoprecipitates by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 2, incubation of the cells with CCK caused rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR. CCK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR was, however, considerably smaller than the effect of EGF. The EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 abolished CCK-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating that the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mediates CCK-induced EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. EGFR activation involves complex formation of the EGFR with the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc and tyrosine phosphorylation of Src homology 2 domain-containing substrates such as Shc (17Gutkind J.S. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/40/re1)PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Grb2 immunoreactivity in EGFR immunoprecipitates showed that CCK increased complex formation between the EGFR and Grb2 (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of Shc immunoprecipitates by anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-Grb2, and anti-EGFR immunoblotting revealed that CCK induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p47Shc and p52Shc as well as complex formation of Shc with Grb2 and the EGFR (Fig. 2 C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that CCK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and Shc as well as formation of a complex between Shc, Grb2, and the EGFR, events closely related to EGFR activation. AG1478 abolished CCK-induced complex formation with Grb2 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR (Fig. 2 B), indicating the involvement of the EGFR tyrosine kinase activation in this process. In contrast, AG1478 had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its complex formation with Grb2 in response to HGF (data not shown), which activates the c-Met/HGF receptor tyrosine kinase, thus confirming that AG1478 specifically antagonized the effect of the EGFR tyrosine kinase in our system. The addition of GF109203X, a chemical inhibitor of PKC, or loading of the cells with the intracellular calcium chelator 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)etheneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid acetoxymethyl ester did not prevent CCK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR (data not shown), indicating that an increase in intracellular calcium or activation of PKC is not essential for CCK-induced EGFR transactivation. Moreover, since cleavage of pro-HB-EGF by metalloproteinases has been shown to mediate EGFR transactivation by Gi- and Gq-coupled receptors in several different cell lines (41Prenzel N. Zwick E. Daub H. Leserer M. Abraham R. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1999; 402: 884-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar), we investigated the effect of neutralizing anti-HB-EGF antibody and of the HB-EGF inhibitor [Glu52]diphtheria toxin (CRM197) on CCK-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and ERK1/2 activation. Anti-HB-EGF or CRM197 had no effect on CCK responses (data not shown), indicating that HB-EGF is not involved in CCK-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation in AR42J cells. Whereas there is agreement concerning the requirement of Ras in EGF- and Gi-coupled receptor-induced ERK1/2 activation, Gq-coupled receptor-induced ERK1/2 activation has been reported to be mediated by both Ras-dependent or -independent pathways (17Gutkind J.S. Science's STKE. 2000; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2000/40/re1)PubMed Google Scholar, 23Della Rocca G.J. van Biesen T. Daaka Y. Luttrell D.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J.

Adenoviral expression of dominant negative Ras was found to have no effect on CCK-induced activation of ERK1/2 in cultured primary pancreatic acinar cells (29Nicke B. Tseng M.J. Fenrich M. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G499-G506PubMed Google Scholar), and CCK appears to have no significant effect on the amount of activated GTP-bound Ras in freshly prepared pancreatic acinar cells (39Duan R.D. Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: G1060-G1065PubMed Google Scholar, 45Dabrowski A. Groblewski G.E. Schäfer C. Guan K.L. Williams J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1472-C1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that Ras may not be involved in CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation in native pancreatic acinar cells. If CCK-induced activation of ERK1/2 is mediated by EGFR transactivation in pancreatic AR42J cells, CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation should depend on Ras activation. Involvement of Ras in CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation was determined in AR42J cells transiently transfected with dominant-negative Ras (N17Ras) or empty vector. As shown in Fig. 3 A, N17Ras inhibited CCK-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The findings that dominant-negative Ras and AG1478 inhibited CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation suggest involvement of both the EGFR and Ras in CCK-induced ERK1/2 activation. Therefore, we studied the effect of CCK, EGF, and AG1478 on Ras activity. Both CCK and EGF increased the amount of GTP-bound Ras in an AG1478-sensitive fashion (Fig.3 B)"

Here, we show that recombinant Apoptin protein spontaneously forms non-covalent globular aggregates comprising 30 to 40 subunits in vitro. This multimerization is robust and virtually irreversible, and the globular aggregates are also stable in cell extracts, suggesting that they remain intact within the cell. Furthermore, studies of Apoptin expressed in living cells confirm that Apoptin indeed exists in large complexes in vivo. We map the structural motifs responsible for multimerization in vitro and aggregation in vivo to the N-terminal half of the protein. Moreover, we show that covalently fixing the Apoptin monomers within the recombinant protein multimer by internal cross-linking does not affect the biological activity of Apoptin, as these fixed aggregates exhibit similar tumor-specific localization and apoptosis-inducing properties as non-cross-linked Apoptin. Taken together, our results imply that recombinant Apoptin protein is a multimer when inducing apoptosis, and we propose that this multimeric state is an essential feature of its ability to do so. Finally, we determine that Apoptin adopts little, if any, regular secondary structure within the aggregates. This surprising result would classify Apoptin as the first protein for which, rather than the formation of a well defined tertiary and quaternary structure, semi-random aggregation is sufficient for activity.

However, non-transformed, normal human primary cell types are not killed. Transformed and non-transformed cells differ markedly in the subcellular localization of expressed Apoptin.

Two clusters of basic residues (Lys82-Arg89, Arg111-Arg120) near the C terminus of Apoptin have been implicated as a nuclear localization signal. To correlate Apoptin's biological activity with its structure and biophysical properties, we studied several bacterially expressed, tagged recombinant Apoptin proteins. First, because maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion constructs can be effective in solubilizing aggregation-prone recombinant proteins, we constructed N-terminally MBP-tagged Apoptin (4Kapust R. Waugh D. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1668-1674Google Scholar, 5Wang C. Castro A. Wilkes D. Altenberg G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 77-81Google Scholar). Second, because histidine tagging can allow efficient refolding of protein immobilized on Ni2+-chelating resin (6Stempfer G. Holl-Neugebauer B. Rudolph R. Nature Biotechnol. 1995; 14: 329-334Google Scholar), we also constructed C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged Apoptin. MBP-Apoptin fusion constructs were shown to be biologically active and retain their distinct behavior in normal and tumor cells upon microinjection. 3Y.-H. Zhang, S. R. Leliveld, K. Kooistra, C.

Noteborn, submitted manuscript. Here, we addressed Apoptin's biophysical and structural properties and how these relate to its biological function and found it to be biologically active as a higher order multimer. However, no evidence was found for an established regular structure. The Apoptin open reading frame (ORF) was amplified by PCR from pET-11aVp3, which contains the Apoptin coding sequence (nucleotides 427–868 in the CAV genome). The purified PCR fragment was cloned at NdeI and NotI in pET-22b (Novagen), in which a T7lac promoter, inducible with isopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG), controls expression. The N-terminal domain of Apoptin (ORF nucleotides 1–207) was amplified by PCR and cloned in pET-22b atNdeI and AvaI. The Apoptin ORF was cloned at 5′ BamHI and 3′ SalI in pMalTB, downstream of theEscherichia coli MalE ORF, which codes for MBP. pMalTB is derived from pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs), and the peptide linker between MBP and its fusion partner contains a thrombin consensus site (-LVPR↓GS-). Expression is controlled by an IPTG-inducible Ptac promoter. The truncated Apoptin(1–69) ORF was amplified from pET-22bVp3(1–69)H6, including the downstream T7 terminator of pET-22b, and cloned into pMalTB atBamHI and SalI. The truncated Apoptin(66–121) ORF, including the stop codon, was cloned in pMalTB at BamHI and SalI. The full MBP-Apoptin ORF, including the stop codon, was amplified by PCR from pMalTBVp3 and cloned at NheI and KpnI in pcDNA3.1mychis(−) type B (Invitrogen). Expression is controlled by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter. pcDNA3.1mychis(−)-MVp3 was digested with BamHI and KpnI, removing the full Apoptin ORF. Subsequently, the truncated Apoptin(80–121) ORF was amplified by PCR and cloned into the linearized vector atBamHI and KpnI. All clones were confirmed by automated fluorescent sequencing. Table I summarizes the protein constructs we generated. Medium to large scale expression was performed in either of two set-ups as follows: 1) 500 ml of expression medium in a 2-liter three-baffled flask (Bellco Glass Inc.) (250 rpm, 37 °C); or 2) a 1.8-liter bench-top fermentor (Biospec Products Inc.) (maximum agitation and aeration, 37 °C). In both cases, a few drops of anti-foam A (Sigma) were added directly prior to inoculation. For expression of MBP fusion proteins, the LB medium was supplemented with 0.2% glucose to suppress the expression of endogenous E. coli α-amylases, which might interfere with affinity purification of the fusion protein. E. coliBL21(λDE3) CaCl2-competent cells were transformed with one of the Apoptin constructs described above. A single transformant colony was grown overnight in LB (+0.2% glucose), supplemented with 200 μg/ml carbenicillin (Duchefa) and if necessary with 0.1 mm ZnSO4. After resuspending the cells in fresh medium, a volume of expression culture (LB + 0.2% glucose, +100 μg/ml carbenicillin, ±0.1 mm ZnSO4) was inoculated 1 in 50. Upon reaching an A 600 of ∼0.8 (2 to 3 h), expression was induced by adding 1 mm IPTG. After 3 to 4 h (finalA 600 = 3 to 5), the cells were harvested and lysed using a BeadBeater (Biospec Products Inc.). Lysis buffers were as follows: 1) for MBP, MBP-Apoptin, MBP-Apoptin(1–69)-H6, and MBP-Apoptin(66–121): 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm reduced glutathione (GSH) (Sigma), 2 mm MgCl2, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (EDTA-free) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), DNase I (10 to 50 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals); 2) for Apoptin-H6: 1× PBS, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Invitrogen), DNase I; 3) Apoptin(1–69)H6, 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm imidazole (Fluka), 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, DNase I, protease inhibitor mixture, 2.5 mm GSH. The glass bead/lysate slurry was filtered (Whatmann 3MM) and centrifuged at 29,000 × g for 15 min. Finally, lysates were fully cleared by filtering over a 0.22-μm filter. The cleared lysate of a 1-liter expression culture was passed twice over an amylose column (2.5 × 20 cm), equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4, under gravity flow at 4 °C. The column was washed with 5 column volumes (CV) of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4 followed by 5 CVs of 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4. The column was then eluted with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4, 10 mmmaltose (Fluka). For all MBP fusion proteins, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) was directly added to the eluate to prevent degradation by traces of E. coli proteases. After filtering, the eluate was loaded on an analytical cation exchange column (UNO-S12) (Bio-Rad), equilibrated at 3 ml/min in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4. After extensive washing, the column was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient (50–1000 mm NaCl, 5-ml fractions). Appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed against PBS (CelluSep T1 membranes, molecular mass cut-off 3.5 kDa; Membrane Filtration Products Inc.). MBP-Apoptin and MBP-Apoptin(66–121) were concentrated on a Biomax 5K or 10K Ultrafree spin filter (Millipore) to 40 and 10 mg/ml, respectively. As a rule, solutions of MBP-Apoptin fusion proteins were never subjected to freeze/thawing and stored at 4 °C for up to one month. We noticed that MBP-Apoptin, but not MBP alone, formed insoluble aggregates when incubated at ∼1 mg/ml in PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (32 mm) N-octylthioglucoside (OG) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 1 h at 30 °C (data not shown). Only a small amount of MBP-Apoptin remained in solution under these conditions, as tested by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). We did not observe such an effect when OG was replaced by CHAPSO (0.5%; Sigma) or Triton X-100 (1%; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Starting with a 1.8-liter expression, the pellet after lysis was resuspended in PBS, 0.5% Triton X-100 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The suspension was then centrifuged at 29,000 ×g for 20 min, after which the inclusion bodies were washed once with PBS. They were then resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm glycine, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mmdl-dithiothreitol, 8 m urea (molecular biology grade) (Invitrogen) and stirred overnight at 4 °C. The cleared supernatant was then loaded on a UNO-S12 column, equilibrated at 3 ml/min in 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm imidazole, 2 mm GSH, 6 murea. After washing, the column was eluted with a 160-ml linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl, 5-ml fractions). Appropriate fractions were pooled and stored at −80 °C if not used immediately afterward. UNO-S12-cleaned Apoptin-H6 was mixed with a suspension of 10 to 15 ml of Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose (Qiagen), equilibrated in 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm GSH, 6 m urea, and stirred at 4 °C for 2 h. The resin was packed into a column, which was subsequently washed with 5 CVs of 20 mmKPO4, pH 7.4, 20 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm GSH, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride (Invitrogen). The denaturant was then removed, in one step, by washing with 5 CVs of 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 5 mm imidazole, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm GSH, 2 mm MgCl2. The protein was eluted with the same buffer, supplemented with 500 mmimidazole. All Ni2+ traces were removed completely by adding 5 mm EDTA to the eluted protein and dialyzing it against 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 400 mmNaCl, 2 mm MgCl2. Refolded Apoptin-H6 was concentrated on a Centricon YM3 filter (Amicon) to 10 mg/ml. Solutions of refolded Apoptin-H6 were never subjected to freeze/thawing and were stored for up to one month at 4 °C. The cleared lysate of a 1-liter expression was applied to an amylose column, as described above. After washing, the fusion protein was eluted in 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm maltose. The eluate was filtered and loaded on a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column (1.5 × 5 cm), which was washed with 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 30 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 300 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl and dialyzed against PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA. Non-fused MBP was purified from IPTG-inducedE. coli BL21(λDE3) transformed with pMalTB. After binding to amylose, the column was washed with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. MBP was then eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm maltose and loaded on an analytical anion exchange column (UNO-Q1; Bio-Rad). The column was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl, 1-ml fractions). MBP-containing fractions (1 to 5 mg/ml) were dialyzed against PBS and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −20 °C. The cleared lysate of a 1-liter culture was loaded on a 5-ml Ni2+-NTA-agarose (1.5 × 3 cm) column. The column was washed with lysis buffer, supplemented with 100 mm imidazole, and then eluted with 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.4, 500 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl. After adding EDTA, the eluate was dialyzed to 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2. Apoptin(1–69)-H6 was concentrated on a Centricon YM3 filter (Amicon) to 10 mg/ml. All protein concentrations were determined fromA 280. The extinction coefficient of MBP-Apoptin and Apoptin-H6 at 280 nm (mg/ml/cm) was 1.0 ± 0.1 and 0.10 ± 0.01, respectively. The molecular mass of MBP-Apoptin and Apoptin-H6 was taken as 55.8 and 14.5 kDa per monomer, respectively. Samples were run as follows: 1) Sephacryl S100 HR (1.0 × 48 cm; Amersham Biosciences), which was calibrated with blue dextran (>2 MDa; Sigma) and Ponceau S (0.76 kDa; Sigma) at a flow rate of 11.5 cm/h in a sample load of 500 μl; or 2) Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Biosciences), which was calibrated with a size exclusion chromatography calibration kit (Bio-Rad) (670, 158, 44, 17, and 1.35 kDa) at a flow rate of 0.2 to 0.4 ml/min in a sample load of 100 μl. For the second set of conditions (Superose 6 HR), linear regression analysis of the elution profile of the calibration run yielded log[molecular mass (kDa)] = 7.773 − (0.365)[ml eluens]. All dynamic light scattering measurements were recorded on a DynaPro-MS/X (Protein Solutions Inc.) at room temperature. Bovine serum albumin was used as a control (0.5 mg/ml in PBS, 0.5 mmEDTA). MBP-Apoptin was measured at 10 μm (monomer concentration) in PBS, 0.5 mm EDTA, and refolded Apoptin-H6 at 35 μm (monomers) in 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2. Per experiment, between 20 and 40 measurements (10-s intervals) were collected. The hydrodynamic radius of the particle (RH) was determined by averaging the results of at least three separate experiments. Protein molecular mass was estimated from the RH by the equation, MM (kDa) = [1.68 × RH]2.34. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectrometer. Spectrometer settings were as follows: wavelength range, 190–260 nm; cell width, 1 mm; scan speed, 50 nm/min; response time, 1.0 s; bandwidth, 1.0 nm; pitch, 0.1 nm. Spectra were averaged over eight acquisitions. Throughout the measurements, the spectrometer was flushed with O2-free N2 at 10 liters/min. Cell temperature was maintained at 20 °C by a Jasco PTC-348WI Peltier element. MBP-Apoptin was dialyzed to 10 mmKPO4, pH 6.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, or 0.1 mm ZnSO4, and refolded Apoptin-H6was dialyzed to 20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 1 mm MgSO4, or 0.1 mmZnSO4. All samples and buffers were filtered and degassed directly prior to measurement. Fluorescence emission and excitation spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50B. Fluorimeter settings were as follows: slit width, 6 nm; scan speed, 120 nm/min; excitation wavelength, 280 nm. Final spectra were obtained by averaging three separate spectra. Background emission and excitation spectra were recorded of the respective filtered buffers. The concentration of refolded Apoptin-H6 was 55 μm (monomer concentration) in refolding buffer (20 mm KPO4, pH 6.5, 400 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). The concentration of free tyrosine (l-Tyr) was 7.5 μm in Apoptin-H6 dialysis buffer, pH 6.5, and 500 μm in 50 mmNa3PO4, pH 12, 1 mm EDTA. Fresh MBP-Apoptin (20 mg/ml, 0.1m NaHCO3, pH 8.3) was incubated with 5 mm sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Molecular Probes, Inc.) at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 mm ethanolamine. To remove unincorporated label, the labeled protein was passed over a PD-10 desalting column (AmershamBiosciences), equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA. Both labeled and unlabeled MBP-Apoptin (30 mg/ml, in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA) were filtered over 0.22-μm spinfilters (Ultrafree-MC; Millipore) and adsorbed to a carbon-coated polioform layer grid. Both samples were incubated with concentrated streptavidin-gold conjugate (gold particle diameter, 5 nm) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc.) and stained with 3% uranyl acetate. Electron microscopy was performed on a Philips TEM 410 transmission electron microscope. 90 ng of purified MBP-Apoptin (in 10 μl of 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 3 mm KCl, 5.5 mm MgCl2) was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min and then deposited on a disc of freshly cleaved mica (Ted Pella Inc.). After 20 s, the mica was gently rinsed with high pressure liquid chromatography water. Excess water was removed, and the disc was dried with a steady flow of 0.22 μm of filtered air. Images were acquired on a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments Inc.), operating in tapping mode in air with a type E scanner. Silicon tips were obtained from Digital Instruments. Protein samples were run on 7.5–15% SDS-PAGE gels, either under reducing or non-reducing conditions, i.e.with or without β-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer. 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Bio-Rad). Samples were run on SDS-PAGE and blotted onto Immunoblot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) or dot blotted directly onto polyvinylidene difluoride after denaturation in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (95 °C for 5 min). Blots were probed with the anti-Apoptin monoclonal antibody 111.3 (epitope, residues 18 to 23) (2Danen-van Oorschot A.A. Fischer D. Grimbergen J. Klein B. Zhuang S.-M. Falkenburg J. Backendorf C. Quax P. van der Eb A. Noteborn M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5843-5847Google Scholar) or with the polyclonal anti-Apoptin antibody αVP3-C, which has an epitope range comprising residues 79 to 90 (9). Blots were subsequently incubated with an appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence. A concentration range of ZnSO4 (1 to 20 μm) (Fluka) was prepared in assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.2% SDS), to which 200 nm FluoZin-1 (Molecular Probes) was added to from a 2 mm stock solution in water. Fluorescence spectra were recorded after 15 min of equilibration at room temperature. Spectra were adjusted for background fluorescence, which was determined from a sample of FluoZin-1, to which 5 mm EDTA had been added. Fluorimeter settings were as follows: slit width, 4 nm; scan speed, 120 nm/min; excitation wavelength, 495 nm. Protein samples were as follows. 1) MBP-Apoptin was expressed in the presence of 0.1 mmZnSO4 and purified without using EDTA. 2) MBP-Apoptin, expressed without additional Zn2+ and treated with EDTA, was incubated with a 10-fold molar excess of ZnSO4overnight at 4 °C (in PBS). Both samples were desalted on a PD-10 column, equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and then denatured in 0.5% SDS (95 °C for 5 min). After cooling to room temperature, the samples were diluted in assay buffer to 10 μm final protein concentration (monomers) and 0.2% final SDS concentration. Fluorescence spectra were recorded after addition of FluoZin-1. The number of solvent-exposed Cys residues per MBP-Apoptin monomer was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Sigma) (10Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 49-60Google Scholar). Fresh MBP-Apoptin (5 mg/ml, PBS) was incubated with 2 mm of fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes), diluted from a freshly prepared 20 mm stock solution in 50 mmNa3PO4, pH 12, and incubated overnight at 4 °C in the dark. The labeling reaction was stopped by adding 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, after which unincorporated label was removed by passing the protein over a PD-10 column (AmershamBiosciences), equilibrated in PBS. The level of label incorporation was determined from the equation, [A/EC] × [MM/C], where A is the absorbance of the label, C is the concentration of labeled protein (in mg/ml), EC is the molar extinction coefficient of the label (cm/M), and MM is the molecular mass of the protein (in Da). Following labeling with fluorescein-5-maleimide, the protein (3 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.05% glutaraldehyde, diluted from a 8% stock solution in water (grade I; Sigma), for 3 min at 30 °C (in the dark). The reaction was stopped by adding 50 mm β-alanine (Fluka). After 20 min, the protein was passed over a PD-10 column, equilibrated in PBS. Saos-2 cells, which are human tumor cells derived from osteosarcoma, and VH10 cells, which are normal human fibroblasts, were grown to around 50% confluency. The cells were washed with cold PBS and harvested in ice-cold 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride (Sigma), 0.25% CHAPSO (Sigma). The suspensions were sonicated on ice, after which insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 29,000 × g for 20 min. After determining the respective protein concentrations, MBP-Apoptin was added to 5% (w/w), which was estimated to be the average ratio of MBP-Apoptin to cytoplasmic protein in microinjected cells (7Lee G. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 94: 443-447Google Scholar, 8Minascheck G. Bereiter-Hahn J. Bertholdt G. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 183: 434-442Google Scholar, 9Danen-van Oorschot A. van der Eb A. Noteborn M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 7072-7078Google Scholar). Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 20 mm MgCl2, and for 2 and 24 h at 4 °C, without additives. Following incubation, samples were fractionated on Superose 6 HR 10/30. Prior to fractionation, any precipitated material was pelleted by centrifugation at 29,000 × g for 20 min, after which the pellets were washed with lysis buffer. All pellets and fractions were dot blotted, using 10 μl per sample, as described above. Dot blots were probed with mAb 111.3. Saos-2 and VH10 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were seeded in 35-mm tissue glass-bottomed culture dishes and grown to 30 to 40% confluency prior to microinjection. During microinjection, cells were incubated in RPMI 1640 medium (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin) at 37 °C. Cells were returned to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium directly after microinjection. Microinjection was performed with 0.5-μm microneedles (sterile femtotips II; Eppendorf) under an inverted microscope (Axiovert 135 TV; Zeiss), equipped with a programmable microinjector (IM 300; Narishige Co.) and a joystick hydraulic micromanipulator (MMO-202; Narishige Co.). Fluorescein-labeled, cross-linked MBP-Apoptin (3 mg/ml, in PBS) was combined with lysine-fixable rhodamine-dextran (Molecular Probes) to mark injected cells. Directly prior to injection, protein samples were filtered over 0.22 μm or centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min. An injection pressure of 0.5 to 1.0 pounds/square inch, and an injection time of 0.2 to 0.5 s was used. For analysis of apoptotic activity, 100 cells were injected per dish. Saos-2 cells were seeded in 9-cm plates at 20% confluency and transfected with 7 μg of DNA using FuGENE 6.0 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol, pcDNA3.1mychis(−)-MVp3, pcDNA3.1mychis(−)-MVp3 (80–121) (3:1 μl/μg FuGENE:DNA ratio), or mock-transfected. For analysis of protein solubility, cells were trypsinized and washed with 1× PBS 2 days after transfection. Cells were pooled from two dishes per construct and resuspended in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm GSH, 2× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and left on ice for 30 min. Cell debris and the bulk of the insoluble protein fraction were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After separating supernatant (S10) and pellet (P10), we centrifuged the supernatant at 30,000 × g for 20 min, yielding S30 and P30. Protein samples were Western blotted, as described above, and blots were stained with αVP3-C. 2 and 24 h after injection, cells were fixed sequentially with PBS, 1% freshly prepared formaldehyde (10 min) and then 100% cold MeOH (5 min) and 80% cold acetone (2 min). Fluorescein-labeled, cross-linked MBP-Apoptin was detected by direct fluorescence. The apoptotic condition of individual cells was deduced from their nuclear morphology after staining with 2,4-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). In a parallel experiment, Saos-2 cells were grown on coverslips in 9-cm plates and transfected as described above, fixed using fresh 1:1 methanol:acetone for 5 min, and stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody that recognized MBP (clone R29.6; Abcam). An appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody was added, and the cells were mounted in DAPI/DABCO(1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane)/glycerol. Again, apoptotic cells were scored on the basis of their nuclear morphology. Detection of MBP-Apoptin with αVP3-C produced comparable results. In E. coli, soluble MBP-Apoptin was expressed with a yield of up to 100 mg per liter of culture. After affinity chromatography on amylose resin and cation exchange chromatography, MBP-Apoptin migrated as a stable multimeric complex, with a molecular mass of 2.5 ± 0.3 MDa, on an analytical size exclusion chromatography column (Superose 6 HR 10/30) (Fig.1, A and B). The molecular mass of the MBP-Apoptin monomer is 56 kDa; see Table I. Analysis of purified MBP-Apoptin by scanning force microscopy and electron microscopy showed a uniform population of globular particles with a radius of ∼40 nm (Fig. 2,A and B). Dynamic light scattering (DLS1) confirmed that the MBP-Apoptin complex is present as a single solute species with an average RH of 17.9 ± 2.0 nm, which corresponds to a diameter of 36 ± 4.0 nm and an estimated molecular mass of 2.9 ± 0.6 MDa. The variation in the average RH of the MBP-Apoptin particle among four separate protein batches remained within experimental error (16 to 20 nm). The multimerization of MBP-Apoptin was independent of the protein concentration (0.5 to 25 mg/ml), ionic strength (up to 0.4m NaCl), and the presence of detergent (0.5% CHAPSO or 1% Triton X-100). Despite the high stability of the complex, there were no covalent bonds between individual MBP-Apoptin monomers, because only monomers could be"

In several bacteria, the gene in the position occupied by TM1643 encodes an aspartate oxidase (NadB), which synthesizes iminoaspartate as a substrate for NadA, the next enzyme in the pathway. The amino acid sequence of TM1643 does not share any recognizable homology with aspartate oxidase or with other proteins of known functions or structures. To help define the biological functions of TM1643, we determined its crystal structure at 2.6Å resolution and performed a series of screens for enzymatic function. The structure reveals the presence of an N-terminal Rossmann fold domain with a bound NAD+ cofactor and a C-terminal α+β domain. The structural information suggests that TM1643 may be a dehydrogenase and the active site of the enzyme is located at the interface between the two domains. The enzymatic characterization of TM1643 revealed that it possesses NAD or NADP-dependent dehydrogenase activity toward l-aspartate but no aspartate oxidase activity. The product of the aspartate dehydrogenase activity is also iminoaspartate. Therefore, our studies demonstrate that two different enzymes, an oxidase and a dehydrogenase, may have evolved to catalyze the first step of NAD biosynthesis in prokaryotes.

TM1643 establishes a new class of amino acid dehydrogenases. open reading frame aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase The open reading frame (ORF)1 TM1643 was identified in the genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (1Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M.

This ORF encodes a soluble, 241-residue protein that is conserved among a large number of organisms, includingCaenorhabditis elegans and humans (Fig.1). Currently, there are more than 15 homologs of this protein in the data base, suggesting it may have an important, conserved function in these living systems. However, the function of this protein cannot be deduced from its sequence, because it does not share any recognizable similarity to other proteins of known function or structure. TM1643 is predicted to be the first gene in a three-gene operon in T. maritima (1Nelson K.E. Clayton R.A. Gill S.R. Gwinn M.L. Dodson R.J. Haft D.H. Hickey E.K. Peterson J.D. Nelson W.C. Ketchum K.A. McDonald L. Utterback T.R. Malek J.A. Linher K.D. Garrett M.M. Stewart A.M. Cotton M.D. Pratt M.S. Phillips C.A. Richardson D. Heidelberg J. Sutton G.G. Fleischmann R.D. Eisen J.A. Fraser C.M. et al.Nature. 1999; 399: 323-329Google Scholar). The second and third genes of this operon have sequence homology to NadA and NadC in Escherichia coli, respectively, which encode proteins that catalyze thede novo biosynthesis of NAD from l-aspartate. In prokaryotes, the first reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by the FAD-containing l-aspartate oxidase (NadB), which oxidizesl-aspartate to iminoaspartate using oxygen or fumarate as electron acceptors (2Nasu S. Wicks F.D. Gholson R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 626-632Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Iminoaspartate is then condensed with dihydroxyacetone phosphate to produce quinolinate, a reaction catalyzed by NadA (quinolinate synthetase A). The third reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by NadC (quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase). These three genes,nadB-nadA-nadC, make an operon in thermophilic bacteria (Pyrococcus, Sulfolobus) and inBacillus. Although the TM1643 gene occupies the equivalent position of NadB in the operon, it does not share any recognizable sequence similarity to NadB. To help define the functional role of this ORF, we have determined its crystal structure at 2.6 Å resolution as part of our structural genomics effort. The structure revealed that TM1643 may be an NAD(P)+-dependent oxidoreductase. Based on the structural information, our enzymatic characterization of this protein showed that it is a dehydrogenase strictly specific forl-aspartate. Our structural and functional studies, together with the position of TM1643 in the Nad operon, therefore suggest that TM1643 and its homologues are aspartate dehydrogenases that catalyze the first step in NAD biosynthesis from aspartate. These results establish a new class of amino acid dehydrogenases. Both aspartate oxidase and aspartate dehydrogenase produce iminoaspartate from the oxidation of l-aspartate (Fig. 2). The difference between them is that the former catalyzes the reduction of FAD (and ultimately oxygen or fumarate), whereas the latter catalyzes the reduction of NAD(P). Recombinant protein was expressed with a hexa-histidine fusion tag at the N terminus inE. coli BL21 (DE3). The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mm benzamidine. The soluble recombinant protein was bound to Ni+2 affinity resin and eluted in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 250 mmimidazole. The purified protein was dialyzed extensively against a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes and 500 mm NaCl, concentrated to 20 mg/ml, and stored at 4 °C. Crystals were grown at room temperature using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. The reservoir solution contained 0.2 m KH2PO4, 22% polyethylene glycol 1500, and 1 mm EDTA. Crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 25% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen for data collection at 100 K. A single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) data set to 2.6 Å resolution was collected at the National Synchrotron Light Source beam lines X4A. The crystal belongs to space groupP41212, with cell parameters ofa = b = 63.2 Å and c = 125.1 Å. The diffraction images were processed with the HKL package (Table I) (3Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar), and the structure refinement was carried out with the program CNS (7Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P.

The crystallographic information is summarized in Table I. Dehydrogenase activity against pools of different substrates (20 amino acids, 9 organic acids, or 8 alcohols) was measured spectrophotometrically by following the increase of absorbance at 340 nm. General assays were performed at 70 °C in a reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tricine buffer (pH 8.5), 0.5 mm NADP+, 0.5 mmNAD+, and 5 mm of the substrate mixture. Dehydrogenase activity with individual amino acids as substrates was measured in a reaction mixture containing 50 mmdiethanolamine buffer (pH 9.8), 1 mm NADP+ (or NAD+), and 5 mm of the amino acid. Asp dehydrogenase activity in the direction of reductive amination (NADPH or NADH oxidation) was monitored at 70 °C as the decrease at 340 nm in a 1-ml mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.15 mm NADPH (or NADH), 5 mm oxaloacetate, and appropriate amount of enzyme. The products of the reaction with l-aspartic acid were detected using enzymatic assays. NH4+ was measured with glutamate dehydrogenase (8Bergmeyer H.U. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 8: 454-461Google Scholar). Pyruvate was measured with lactate dehydrogenase (9Bergmeyer H.U. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 6: 570-577Google Scholar) and with alanine dehydrogenase (10Yoshida A. Freese E. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 176-181Google Scholar). The spectrophotometric assay for l-Asp oxidase activity was carried out using the horseradish peroxidase-coupled method by following the oxidation of o-dianisidine at 460 nm (11Tedeschi G. Negri A. Mortarino M. Ceciliani F. Simonic T. Faotto L. Ronchi S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 427-433Google Scholar). The aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (ASA-DH) activity in the biosynthetic direction (the synthesis ofl-aspartate-β-semialdehyde) was examined by using the previously described aspartate kinase-coupled method (12Angeles T.S. Viola R.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 283: 96-101Google Scholar). The ASA-DH activity in the phosphorylating direction was assayed at 70 °C with aspartate semialdehyde as a substrate (a kind gift from Dr. Wright) by following the increase in the absorbance at 340 nm as described previously (13Karsten W.E. Viola R.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1077: 209-219Google Scholar). The inositol-1-phosphate synthase activity was examined as previously described (14Wong Y.H. Mauck L.A. Sherman W.R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 309-314Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the TM1643 ORF of T. maritima in complex with NAD+has been determined at 2.6 Å resolution by the seleno-methionyl SAD method (15Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Google Scholar). The current R factor of the model is 22.6%. The crystallographic information is summarized in TableI. The atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank with the accession code 1H2H. While our structure determination was in progress, another research group deposited the structure of this protein in the PDB (entry 1J5P). The rms distance for all the equivalent Cα atoms of the two structures is 0.3 Å. The structure of TM1643 contains two domains. The backbone fold of the N-terminal domain (residues 1–105) is essentially the same as that of the canonical Rossmann fold, with a central six-stranded parallel β-sheet (Fig. 3 A). The NAD+ molecule is associated with this domain at a position that is equivalent to the binding site in other Rossmann folds. This structural observation immediately suggests that TM1643 may be an oxidoreductase. The C-terminal domain (residues 113–241) has an open-faced sandwich structure with a five-stranded mixed β-sheet with three helices on one side (Fig. 3 A). The nicotinamide ring of NAD+ is located at the interface between the two domains, indicating that this likely is the location of the active site of this enzyme (Fig. 3 A). The C-terminal domain also helps to mediate the dimerization of the protein. The β-sheets in the C-terminal domains of the two monomers are arranged in a side-by-side fashion, and this creates a ten-stranded β-sheet in the dimer (Fig. 3 B). In addition, the C-terminal residues of one monomer form a short β-strand, and it extends the six-stranded β-sheet in the N-terminal domain of the other monomer (Fig. 3 B). Our structural observation suggests that TM1643 is likely to exist as dimers in solution. Searches with the program Dali against the data base of known protein structures (16Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Google Scholar) revealed that TM1643 has weak structural homology to several other NAD(P)+–dependent oxidoreductases, including inositol 1-phosphate synthase (17Norman R.A. McAlister M.S.B. Murray-Rust J. Movahedzadeh F. Stoker N.G. McDonald N.Q. Structure. 2002; 10: 393-402Google Scholar), dihydrodipicolinate reductase (18Scapin G. Blanchard J.S. Sacchettini J.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3502-3512Google Scholar), and ASA-DH (19Hadfield A. Shammas C. Kryger G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Ouyang J. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14475-14483Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence identity among the structurally equivalent residues is below 15%, underscoring the lack of sequence homology between TM1643 and other proteins. As could be expected, this structural homology is stronger in the N-terminal Rossmann fold domain. The core of the C-terminal β-sheet is similar among these structures, although there are also significant variations such as the presence of additional strand(s) in the sheet. Overall, the structural homology strongly supports the notion that TM1643 is also an oxidoreductase (dehydrogenase). In addition, open and closed forms of the structures have been observed from studies on these other enzymes, with changes in the relative positioning of the two domains. Our structure of TM1643 appears to be in an open form. The active site of TM1643 is located at the interface between the N- and C-terminal domains of the monomer. Residues in this active site come from strands β7 and β10, helices αA, αF, and αG, the β5-αC loop and the αE-αF loop, and finally the linker between the two domains (residues 106–112) (Fig. 4 A). They are generally well conserved among this family of proteins (Fig. 1). There is a clear depression on the surface of the protein, delineating the region for substrate binding and catalysis (Fig. 4 B). This active site region is open to the solvent in the current structure (Fig. 4 B). It is expected that the active site will be shielded from the solvent in the closed form of the enzyme when the substrate is bound. Our structural analysis showed that the His-193 residue may function as the general acid/base in the catalysis by these enzymes. This residue is strictly conserved among all family members and may be located near the C4 position of the nicotinamide ring in the closed form of the enzyme. In support of this observation, the His-193 residue is structurally equivalent to the catalytic His residue in ASA-DH (19Hadfield A. Shammas C. Kryger G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Ouyang J. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14475-14483Google Scholar). A short loop of the enzyme, residues 212–219 (just prior to helix αG, Figs. 2 A and 3 A), is disordered in our current structure. These residues may be located in the active site, helping form a flap over the active site when the substrate is bound. Although TM1643 is located in the position corresponding to the aspartate oxidase gene (nadB) of the Nad operons, it does not share any sequence or structural homology with l-aspartate oxidases. Furthermore, purified TM1643 showed no evidence for the presence of an FAD cofactor, and the enzyme has no l-aspartate oxidase activity (data not shown). It is therefore highly unlikely that TM1643 is an aspartate oxidase. TM1643 shows structural homology to ASA-DH. However, it is unlikely to be an ASA-DH because its active site lacks the Cys residue required for the catalysis by ASA-DH (19Hadfield A. Shammas C. Kryger G. Ringe D. Petsko G.A. Ouyang J. Viola R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14475-14483Google Scholar). Our enzymatic studies with purified TM1643 showed no ASA-DH activity in either the forward or the reverse reaction. In addition, purified TM1643 has no homoserine dehydrogenase or inositol-1-phosphate synthase activity, the latter enzyme being a structural homolog of TM1643. With the information obtained from the structural studies, and from the analysis of the operon sequence conservation, we next performed enzymatic screens to explore various compounds as potential substrates for the presumed TM1643 dehydrogenase activity. The structural information suggested that TM1643 would likely possess dehydrogenase activity. To identify substrate(s) for TM1643, we designed general dehydrogenase screens using a mixture of NAD and NADP as the electron acceptors and three mixtures of substrates (amino acids, organic acids, or alcohols) as electron donors. Significant dehydrogenase activity was observed only with the pool of amino acids. When tested individually as electron donors, TM1643 showed robust dehydrogenase activity towardl-aspartate. No activity was found withd-aspartate; the enzyme is strictly specific forl-aspartate. l-glutamate and asparagine are not substrates of this enzyme. Purified TM1643 showed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and linear double-reciprocal plots were obtained with all three substrates tested,l-aspartate, NADP, and NAD (Fig.5, A and B). The TM1643 kinetic parameters are presented in TableII. Interestingly, theK m for l-Asp was ∼20 times lower in the presence of NAD than in the presence of NADP (Fig. 5 Band Table II). Noting the lower K m for NAD andl-aspartate, it is likely that the TM1643 dehydrogenase uses NAD as the cofactor for the oxidation of aspartate in vivo. This is also consistent with our observation that NAD was co-purified and co-crystallized with TM1643 (Fig. 3 A).Table IISteady-state kinetic parameters for TM1643 and E. coli aspartate oxidaseVariable substrateSaturated substrateK mk catk cat/K mmMs −1M −1 s −1TM1643l-AspNADP1.20 ± 0.054.9 ± 0.094.1 × 103l-AspNAD0.067 ± 0.0080.78 ± 0.0211.6 × 103NADPl-Asp0.72 ± 0.047.2 ± 0.1710.0 × 103NADl-Asp0.25 ± 0.021.2 ± 0.044.7 × 103E. coli aspartate oxidaseaKinetic parameters for E. coli aspartate oxidase with O2 or fumarate as electron acceptors (11).l-Asp (O2)5.22.60.5 × 103l-Asp (fumarate)2.75.62.1 × 103a Kinetic parameters for E. coli aspartate oxidase with O2 or fumarate as electron acceptors (11Tedeschi G.

Open table in a new tab The l-aspartate dehydrogenase activity of TM1643 was not affected by the addition of l-glutamate, succinate, fumarate, pyruvate, tartrate, or d-malate, whereasl-malate and NH4+ were competitive inhibitors with K i = 4.02 ± 0.48 mm and 32.5 ± 4.9 mm, respectively. Like the reaction catalyzed by aspartate oxidase, aspartate dehydrogenase is also expected to produce iminoaspartate from the oxidation of l-aspartate (Fig. 2). In aqueous solution, however, the iminoaspartate product is not stable, and its hydrolysis will produce ammonia and oxaloacetate (Fig. 2). We examined the products formed by the reaction ofl-aspartate dehydrogenase (besides NADPH and NADH). Ammonium was detected in almost equimolar quantities to the NADH produced (data not shown). We were unable to detect oxaloacetate, however, presumably because it is very unstable under the experimental conditions that we used (pH 9.8 and 70 °C). Oxaloacetate is likely to quickly decarboxylate to pyruvate, and we were able to identify the production of pyruvate by using two enzymatic assays (data not shown). We could also demonstrate the reverse reaction, reductive amination of oxaloacetate by purified TM1643 at 70 °C and pH 8.0, using reaction conditions previously described for glutamate dehydrogenase (8Bergmeyer H.U. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 8: 454-461Google Scholar). In this reverse reaction, NADPH and NADH were equally effective as electron donors. Our structural and enzymatic studies demonstrate that TM1643 is a novel amino acid dehydrogenase that is strictly specific for l-aspartate. This raises a question concerning its functional role in T. maritima. T. maritima contains a well characterized glutamate dehydrogenase that plays a key role in linking the carbon and nitrogen metabolism in all organisms. Therefore, it is unlikely that the TM1643 aspartate dehydrogenase plays the same role in T. maritima. TM1643 does not share direct structural similarity to the superfamily of leucine, valine, glutamate, and phenylalanine dehydrogenases (20Turnbull A.P. Baker P.J. Rice D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25105-25111Google Scholar) and thereby establishes a new class of amino acid dehydrogenases. These other enzymes catalyze the oxidative deamination of the amino acid substrates (21Rife J.E. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2328-2333Google Scholar, 22Tally J.F. Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11284-11293Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). In contrast, TM1643 is part of the Nad operon in T. maritima, and our BLAST analysis did not reveal the presence of an l-aspartate oxidase homolog inT. maritime. We propose therefore that in this organism TM1643 catalyzes the first reaction of de novo biosynthesis of NAD from aspartate, and it produces iminoaspartate required for this pathway. The formation of an enzyme complex between TM1643 and NadA, the next enzyme of the pathway, may allow the channeling of this unstable product directly to the NadA active site.

Activation kinetics of WT-II, rMZ-II, and rP2-II indicated that the catalytic efficiency of cleavage at Arg320 was increased by 30,000-fold by the cofactor factor Va, as was the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. However, factor Va increased cleavage at Arg271 only by 34-fold. Although WT-II competitively inhibited cleavage of WT-II-F*, rMZ-II or rP2-II did not inhibit completely even at saturating concentrations. However, rMZ-II and rP2-II together inhibited WT-II-F* cleavage competitively. Both WT-II and rMZ-II competitively inhibited rMZ-II-F* cleavage, whereas rP2-II did not. A model of prothrombin activation that includes two equilibrating forms of prothrombinase, each recognizing one of the cleavage sites, is quantitatively consistent with all of the experimental observations.

Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two bond cleavages are required for thrombin formation, one at Arg271 and one at Arg320. Therefore, two activation pathways are possible during prothrombin activation, yielding the intermediates fragment 1.2:prethrombin-2 (F1.2:Pre2)1 and meizothrombin. Cleavage at Arg271 first produces the intermediate F1.2:Pre2, whereas cleavage at Arg320 first produces the intermediate meizothrombin. In the absence of factor Va, the accumulation of the intermediate F1.2:Pre2 is observed (6Heldebrant C.M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3642-3652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Heldebrant C.M. Butkowski R.J. Bajaj S.P. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

In the presence of fully assembled prothrombinase, however, accumulation of the intermediate meizothrombin is observed (9Krishnaswamy S. Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that factor Va directs the reaction toward the meizothrombin pathway. The first objective of this study was to determine the effects of factor Va on cleavage at Arg271 and Arg320 in prothrombin. Three recombinant prothrombin derivatives were prepared for this purpose (see Fig. 1). These were WT-II, which can be cleaved at both Arg271 and Arg320 to produce thrombin (10Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the derivative rMZ-II, which can be cleaved only at Arg320 to produce the intermediate meizothrombin (10Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the derivative rP2-II, which can be cleaved only at Arg271to produce the intermediate F1.2:Pre2. These mutants, in addition to meizothrombin and F1.2:Pre2, allowed us to isolate each individual step of the overall reaction and to determine the catalytic efficiency of all bond cleavages involved in prothrombin activation. Two additional recombinant prothrombin derivatives were used to carry out competition assays between each of the three recombinant prothrombin derivatives (see Fig. 1). The derivative WT-II-F* is an active-site mutant of prothrombin in which the active-site serine was mutated to cysteine, which was subsequently labeled with fluorescein (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The derivative rMZ-II-F* is the rMZ-II derivative with the active-site serine-to-cysteine mutation labeled with fluorescein. Both of these mutants displayed an increase in fluorescence intensity upon activation and therefore allowed us to monitor their activation specifically in the presence of WT-II, rMZ-II, and rP2-II as competitors. As will be shown, the competition studies suggest that prothrombinase exists in two equilibrating forms, one catalyzing cleavage at Arg271 and the other at Arg320. DNA restriction and modification enzymes were obtained from New England Biolabs Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) or Invitrogen (Burlington, Ontario). Recombinant DNA polymerase fromPyrococcus sp.

Purified ecarin was prepared from the venom by a modification of the procedure described previously (13Bell R. Spectral and Functional Properties of Single Tryptophan-to-Phenylalanine Mutants of Prothrombin and Thrombin.M.Sc. Thesis. Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada2000Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼70 mg of lyophilized venom was dissolved in 20 ml of 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The solution was clarified by centrifugation and treated with 2 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 5 μmPhe-Phe-Arg-chloromethyl ketone for 1 h at room temperature. The sample was then applied to a 20-ml DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The column was washed with the equilibration buffer until the absorbance of the eluent was zero at 280 nm. Ecarin was eluted with a NaCl gradient (0.05 mTris-HCl and 0 m NaCl to 0.05 m Tris and 0.25m NaCl). Fractions were assayed for ecarin activity (13Bell R. Spectral and Functional Properties of Single Tryptophan-to-Phenylalanine Mutants of Prothrombin and Thrombin.M.Sc. Thesis. Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada2000Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of calcium ion. Fractions containing ecarin-like activity (both calcium ion-dependent and -independent) were pooled and loaded onto a 2-ml Cibacron blue-Sepharose Column. The column was washed with 0.05 mTris-HCl and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 8.0) until the absorbance of the eluent was zero at 280 nm. Calcium ion-dependent ecarin-like activity was found in the flow-through fractions. Calcium ion-independent ecarin was eluted with 0.05 m Tris-HCl and 0.25 m NaCl (pH 8.0). Ecarin-containing fractions were assayed for activity in the presence and absence of calcium ion. Calcium ion-dependent and -independent fractions were pooled separately and ammonium sulfate-precipitated (80% saturation). Ecarin was stored in 0.05 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.02% sodium azide at 4 °C. The fluorescent inhibitor dansylarginine-N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA) was prepared as described previously (14Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Phospholipid vesicles (75% PC and 25% PS (PCPS)) were prepared as described by Bloom et al. (15Bloom J.W. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 4419-4425Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Human prothrombin (16Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5201-5212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), factor Xa (16Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and factor Va (18Nesheim M.E. Katzmann J.A. Tracy P.B. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 249-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were prepared as described previously. F1.2:Pre2 was made by incubating human prothrombin (10 μm) with an equal volume of factor Xa-Sepharose in the presence of 10 μm DAPA at room temperature for 3 h. The sample was filtered through 0.2-μm filters and subsequently incubated with 0.1 volume of benzamidine-Sepharose at room temperature for 10 min to remove traces of thrombin and factor Xa, followed by 0.2-μm filtration. Meizothrombin was formed by treating prothrombin with purified Ca2+-independent ecarin in 0.02 mTris, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2in the presence of 5 μm DAPA. F1.2:Pre2 and meizothrombin were freshly prepared for each experiment and were used within 10 min. Factor Xa-Sepharose and 125I-labeled human prothrombin were prepared as described previously (19Boskovic D.S. Bajzar L.S. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28686-28693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for rMZ-II (10Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and for WT-II-F* (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) had been prepared previously in our laboratory. The cDNA for rMZ-II-F* was prepared as described previously for WT-II-F*, except that the starting template was that for rMZ-II instead of WT-II, and the DNA polymerase used wasPfx. For the production of the rP2-II cDNA, pBluescript SK+ containing full-length rMZ-II cDNA was digested with HindIII, SacI, and PstI. TheHindIII/SacI fragment spanned nucleotides 307–1076 and was excised to facilitate the amino acid substitution of Ala271 with Arg271 and the insertion of aBsiWI restriction site. The primers used were 5′-GAAGGGCGTACGGCCACA-3′ with the T7 promoter primer (Stratagene) and 5′-TGTGGCCGTACGCCCTTC-3′ with the T3 promoter primer (Stratagene). TheSacI/PstI fragment spanned nucleotides 1076–1583 and was excised to facilitate the amino acid substitution of Arg320 with Ala320 and the insertion of aNarI restriction site. The primers used were 5′-ATCGACGGCGCCATTGTG-3′ with the T7 promoter primer and 5′-CACAATGGCGCCGTCGAT-3′ with the T3 promoter primer. Each PCR product was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK+ and then cut with the appropriate restriction endonuclease along with that for the newly introduced site. Digested fragments were ligated at their new restriction sites and subcloned into pBluescript SK+. The presence of mutations and correct PCR amplifications were verified by DNA sequence analysis using the T3 and T7 promoter primers. The mutated fragments were ligated into the cDNA for rMZ-II. The resulting cDNA was subcloned into the pNUT vector and prepared for expression as described previously (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Cell culture, transfection, and selection was carried out as described previously (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant prothrombins were purified as described previously (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, stored media were thawed at 4 °C and loaded onto XAD-2 (2.5 × 15 cm) and Q-Sepharose (1.4 × 8 cm) columns in tandem at either 4 or 21 °C. The XAD-2 column was used to remove indicator dye in the medium. Adsorbed prothrombin was eluted from the Q-Sepharose with 0.02m Tris-HCl and 0.5 m NaCl (pH 7.4). Protein-containing fractions were identified using a Bio-Rad assay and pooled. Fluorescent labeling of mutants containing free cysteine residues was performed directly on this pooled fraction by adding a 30-fold molar excess of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein from a 20 mm stock solution of 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein inN,N-dimethylformamide and incubating the sample for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. Prothrombin pools were subjected to barium citrate adsorption by the addition of sodium citrate to a final concentration of 0.025 m, followed by the addition of 1.0 m BaCl2 solution, with stirring, to a final concentration of 0.08 m. The solution was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was washed and solubilized as described previously (11Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17663-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sample was then dialyzed against 0.02 m Tris-HCl and 0.15m NaCl (pH 7.4) and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C. The protein was eluted with a 0–30 mm CaCl2 gradient in 0.02 mTris-HCl and 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4) (total volume of 30 ml; flow rate of 0.5 ml/min). This was performed to separate protein that was fully γ-carboxylated (10Cote H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E. MacGillivray R.T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11374-11380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first peak was pooled, and protein concentrations and labeling efficiencies (where applicable) were determined by absorbance readings at 280 and 495 nm, respectively. Substrates were activated at various concentrations in the presence of 50 μm PCPS and 5 μm DAPA in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 80. Reactions were started at room temperature by the addition of 20 nm factor Xa. In the cases of WT-II, rMZ-II, and F1.2:Pre2, reactions were allowed to proceed for 10 min, at which time an aliquot was removed and diluted into a 96-well plate that had been pretreated with 0.02 mTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Tween 80. Wells contained a sufficient volume of S2238 (H-d-phenylalanyl-l-pipecolyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline dihydrochloride) so that the final concentration was 400 μm. Absorbance at 405 nm was read over time in a Spectromax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) at room temperature. Initial rates of S2238 hydrolysis were determined and compared with a thrombin standard curve. In the case of rP2-II, aliquots were removed from activation reactions and diluted into 2 volumes 0.2 m acetic acid. Aliquots were concentrated, and reduced samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5–15% polyacrylamide minigels according to Neville (20Neville D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 6328-6334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometry was carried out to determine the amount of prethrombin-2 produced at each time point. In the case of meizothrombin activation, reactions were carried out in a 96-well plate that had been pretreated with 0.02 mTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Tween 80 and monitored in a Spectra Max Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 545 nm, respectively, with a 515-nm emission cutoff filter in the emission beam. Initial rates of activation for all substrates were calculated and plottedversus the substrate concentration. The data are plotted as the means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. TheK m and k cat values were determined by nonlinear regression of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using the NONLIN module of SYSTAT (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Substrates were activated at various concentrations in the presence of 50 μm PCPS, 20 nm factor Va, and 5 μm DAPA in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 80. In the case of WT-II, rMZ-II, F1.2:Pre2, and meizothrombin, reactions were carried out in 96-well plates that had been pretreated with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 1% Tween 80. Reactions were started at room temperature by the addition of 0.02 nm factor Xa and monitored in the Spectra Max Gemini fluorescence plate reader at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 545 nm, respectively, with a 515-nm emission cutoff filter in the emission beam. In the case of rP2-II, aliquots were removed from activation reactions and diluted into 2 volumes of 0.2 macetic acid. Aliquots were concentrated, and reduced samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 5–15% polyacrylamide minigels. Densitometry was carried out to determine the amount of prethrombin-2 produced at each point. Initial rates of activation for all substrates were calculated and plotted versus the concentration of substrate. The data are plotted as the means ± S.D. of at least three experiments. The K m andk cat values were determined by nonlinear regression. Unlabeled prothrombin (1 μm) was activated in the presence of a trace amount of125I-prothrombin (150,000 cpm) with 50 μm PCPS, 20 nm factor Va, 0.035 nm factor Xa, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.01% Tween 80. The reaction was started at room temperature by the addition of factor Xa. Aliquots were removed from the reaction, diluted into 2 volumes of 0.2 m acetic acid, and concentrated. Reduced samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were fixed in 50% methanol, 20% ethanol, and 6% trichloroacetic acid for 2 h and then stained with Coomassie Blue and destained. Bands were excised and counted in an Amersham Biosciences Minigamma 1275 γ-counter. The experiment was performed twice, and three gels were analyzed. The data are plotted as the means ± S.D. of three results. Studies of prothrombin activation indicated that the substrates rMZ-II and rP2-II only partially inhibited prothrombin activation (see below). This phenomenon could not be rationalized by any conceivable equilibrium model that involved only one form of prothrombinase because, in such a model, competing substrate at a sufficiently high concentration would occupy all of the enzyme, thereby completely inhibiting prothrombin activation. Therefore, the following model was constructed to account for partial inhibition by rMZ-II and rP2-II. The model includes two equilibrating forms of prothrombinase, designated E and E′, as indicated in Equation 1. One of these forms (E) catalyzes cleavage at Arg320. Thus, it catalyzes conversion of prothrombin (P) to meizothrombin (M), F1.2:Pre2 (P2) to thrombin (T), and rMZ-II (rMZ) to rMZ-IIa(rMZa). The other form (E′) catalyzes cleavage at Arg271 and thereby catalyzes conversion of prothrombin to F1.2:Pre2, meizothrombin to thrombin, and rP2-II (rP2) to rP2-IIa(rP2a). In this model, once a particular form of the enzyme catalyzes its corresponding bond cleavage, it releases the product and reverts to the other form of the enzyme. In this sense, the model is similar to the classical “ping-pong” mechanism of enzyme kinetics. The proposition that E and E′ can equilibrate is included in the model to account for the fact that rMZ-II, rP2-II, meizothrombin, and F1.2:Pre2 can be completely activated. This could not happen if the two forms of the enzyme could not interconvert spontaneously. Each form of the enzyme is presumed to interact with its substrate (S) in an equilibrium binding interaction such that [E][S] =K[ES] and [E′][S] =K[E′S]. The enzyme-substrate complexes then turn over to product at rate r, where r =k[ES] or r =k[E′S]. The term k is the turnover number. Each reaction rate can therefore be expressed in terms of the free enzyme forms according to r = (k/K)[E][S] or r = (k/K)[E′][S]. Each specific reaction is allowed its own k and Kvalues. These are shown in Equations 2 and 3. View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The rate of thrombin formation (r) is the sum of the rates of conversion of the intermediates meizothrombin and F1.2:Pre2 to thrombin (Equation 4). r=(k3/K3)[E][P2]+(k6/K6)[E′][M]Equation 4 To express the rate of the reaction in terms of the prothrombin concentration, steady states with respect to the levels of the intermediates are assumed, such that their rates of formation from prothrombin and subsequent conversion to thrombin are equal. Thus, for meizothrombin, (k 2/K 2)[P][E] = (k 6/K 6)[E′][M]; and for prethrombin-2, (k 5/K 5)[E′][P] = (k 3/K 3)[E][P2]. The rate of prothrombin activation then can be expressed in terms of the prothrombin concentration according to Equation 5. r=((k2/K2)[E]+(k5/K5)[E′])[P]Equation 5 To further develop the rate equation, the conservation of enzyme is considered. Because some experiments were carried out in the presence of rMZ-II and rP2-II as competing substrates, the interactions of E and E′ with them are also accounted for in the conservation equation. The total concentration of the enzyme ([E]T) is given in Equation 6 and again in Equation 7, where all [ES] or [E′S] forms have been expressed in terms of [E], [E′], [S], and the appropriate K values. rMZ-II and rP2-II are assumed to interact with E and E′ with dissociation constants K 4 andK 7. [E]T=[E]+[EP]+[E′M]+[ErMZ]+[E′]+[E′P]Equation 6 +[EP2]+[E′rP2] [E]T=[E]+[E][P]/K2+[E′][M]/K6+[E][rMZ]/K4+[E′]Equation 7 +[E′][P]/K5+[E][P2]/K3+[E′][rP2]/K7 The steady states in meizothrombin and F1.2:Pre2 are again invoked to eliminate terms containing them from the conservation equation. Thus, [E′][M]/K 6 = (k 2/k 6)[E][P]/K 2and [E][P2]/K 3 = (k 5/k 3)[E′][P]/K 5. The conservation of enzyme is then given according to Equation 8. [E]T=[E](1+(1+k2/k6)[P]/K2+[rMZ]/K4)+[E′](1Equation 8 +(1+k5/k3)[P]/K5+[rP2]/K7)Division of Equation 5 by Equation 8 and then division of the numerator and denominator of the resulting equation by [E] yield Equation 9, which gives the rate per totalconcentration of enzyme. r/[E]T=((k2/K2)+(k5/K5)[E′]/[E])[P]1+(1+k2/k6)[P]/K2+[rMZ]/K4+(1+(1+k5/k3)[P]/K5+[rP2]/K7)[E′]/[E]Equation 9 The ratio [E′][E] in Equation 8 can be eliminated by assuming a steady state in [E] (and therefore [E′]). Thus, the rates of formation and removal ofE are presumed equal. This is expressed in Equation 10. k2K2[E][P]+k3K3[E][P2]+k4K4[E][rMZ]+k1[E]=k5K5[E′][P]Equation 10 +k6K6[E′][M]+k7K7[E′][rP2]+k−1[E′]Invoking steady states in the levels of the intermediates allows for simplification of Equation 10 to give Equation 11. (k4/K4)[rMZ]+k1)[E]=((k7/K7)[rP2]+k−1)[E′]Equation 11 Equation 11 is then solved for the ratio [E′]/[E], which is given in Equation 12. [E′]/[E]=((k4/K4)[rMZ]+k1)/((k7/K7)[rP2]+k−1)Equation 12 The right-hand side of Equation 12 is substituted for [E′]/[E] in Equation 9. When this is done, Equation 13 is the result, with the terms k cat,K m, a 1,a 2, a 3,b 1, b 2,b 3, c, and β given in EquationsEquation 14, Equation 15, Equation 16, Equation 17, Equation 18, Equation 19, Equation 20, Equation 21, Equation 22, Equation 23. r/[E]T=kcat[P]+a1[P][rMZ]+b1[P][rP2]Km+[P]+(a2+a3[P])[rMZ]+(b2+b3[P])[rP2]+c[rMZ][rP2]Equation 13 kcat=(k−1k2K5+k1k5K2)/βEquation 14 Km=((k1+k−1)K2K5)/βEquation 15 a1=k4k5K2/K4/βEquation 16 a2=K2K5(k−1+k4)/K4/βEquation 17 a3=k4K2(1+k5/k3)/K4/βEquation 18 b1=k2k7K5/K7/βEquation 19 b2=K2K5(k1+k7)/K7/βEquation 20 b3=k7K5(1+k2/k6)/K7/βEquation 21 c=K2K5(k4+k7)/K4/K7/βEquation 22 β=k−1K5(1+k2/k6)+k1K2(1+k5/k3)Equation 23 Equation 13 predicts that, in the absence of competing substrates ([rMZ-II] = 0, [rP2-II] = 0), prothrombin activation kinetics will conform to the Michaelis-Menten equationr/[E]T =k cat[P]/(K m + [P]), withk cat and K m defined in Equations 14, 15, and 23. It also predicts that the competing substrates rMZ-II and rP2-II will inhibit prothrombin only partially. With rMZ-II, for example, as [rMZ-II] is raised without bounds (in the absence of rP2-II), Equation 13 predicts that prothrombin activation will occur at a non-zero rate, r∞ =a 1[P]/(a 2 +a 3[P]). Thus, at saturation with respect to [rMZ-II], a finite rate of prothrombin activation will be expected. Furthermore, its value will depend on the prothrombin concentration. The same behavior is predicted with rP2-II, with r∞ =b 1[P]/(b 2 +b 3[P]). By analogous reasoning, the rate of rMZ-II activation in the presence of rP2-II is given in Equation 24, with k cat,K m, g 1,g 2, and g 3 given in Equations Equation 25, Equation 26, Equation 27, Equation 28, Equation 29. r[E]T=kcat[rMZ]+g1[rMZ][rP2]Km+[rMZ]+(g2+g3[rMZ])[rP2]Equation 24 kcat=k−1k4/(k−1+k4)Equation 25 Km=K4(k−1+k1)/(k−1+k4)Equation 26 g1=k4k7/K7/(k−1+k4)Equation 27 g2=(K4/K7)(k1+k7)/(k−1+k4)Equation 28 g3=(k4+k7)/K7/(k−1+k4)Equation 29 Similarly, the rate of activation of rP2-II with rMZ-II as a competing substrate is given in Equation 30, withk cat, K m,h 1, h 2, andh 3 given in Equations Equation 31, Equation 32, Equation 33, Equation 34, Equation 35. r[E]T=kcat[rP2]+h1[rP2][rMZ]Km+[rP2]+(h2+h3[rP2])[rMZ]Equation 30 kcat=k1k7/(k1+k7)Equation 31 Km=K7(k1+k−1)/(k1+k7)Equation 32 h1=k4k7/K4/(k1+k7)Equation 33 h2=(K7/K4)(k−1+k4)/(k1+k7)Equation 34 h3=(k4+k7)/K4/(k1+k7)Equation 35 Equations 24 and 30 show that the activation kinetics of rMZ-II and rP2-II, each in the absence of the other, will conform to the Michaelis-Menten equation r/[E]T =k cat[S]/(K m + [S]), withk cat and K m values given in Equations 25, 26, 31, and 32. The forms of Equations 24 and 30 also predict that rMZ-II and rP2-II will only partially inhibit the activation of each other, just as they only partially inhibit the activation of prothrombin.

A new perspective is opened for the understanding of the functional role of metal ions in biological processes. Many enzymatic reactions involving nucleic acids are known to critically rely on the cooperative action of divalent metal cofactors, such as magnesium, that are incorporated into the protein as positively charged ions (1Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Although quite well established, their functional role has not yet received a satisfactory explanation and is still a matter of debate and speculation. Among these reactions, the ones more often investigated experimentally pertain to the family of enzymes called type II restriction endonucleases. These enzymes are highly site-specific; their biological function is that of cleaving DNA at both strands (2Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), and they all require metal cofactors. This is a process of primary biochemical importance. For example, this process provides protection to bacterial cells against bacteriophage infection, occurs naturally during programmed cell death (apoptosis), and has been exploited in genetic engineering. The experimental information accumulated over the years (seee.g. Refs. 1Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 2Pingoud A. Jeltsch A. Eur. J.

More is needed to unravel the precise mechanism driving the cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the DNA strands (11Galburt E.A. Stoddard B.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13851-13860Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although there is little doubt that the reaction takes place via a concerted nucleophilic substitution, it is still unclear whether the attacking nucleophile is a water molecule or a hydroxide ion. More importantly the activity of these enzymes crucially depends on the presence and identity of the metal ions, 1Between one and three metal binding sites have been observed in the crystallographic structures of different restriction endonucleases, but the correlation between number of ions and activity is unclear. but simple features, such as ionic size, electronegativity, or average coordination number, do not simply correlate with it. Other issues concern the extent to which the characteristics of the initial state of the reaction or the presence of water molecules can affect its development. Here we make definitive progress toward answering all these questions with the aid of accurate computer simulations that provide the so far missing insight into the mechanism of the catalytic reaction and a reliable evaluation of its energetics. The validity of any computational approach to enzymatic processes critically relies on a quantum mechanical description of the active site, but the modeling often suffers from the size limitation typical of ab initio calculations. To overcome this restriction, combined quantum-classical approaches have been proposed for a long time (12Warshel A. Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 227-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (3695) Google Scholar, 13Singh U.C. Kollman P.A. J. Comput. Chem. 1986; 7: 718-730Crossref Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 14Field M.J. Bash P.A. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 700-733Crossref Scopus (2185) Google Scholar) that partition the system into two subsystems: the close environment of the reaction site, treated quantum mechanically (QM), 2The abbreviations used are: QM, quantum mechanics; MM, molecular mechanics; DFT, density functional theory; GROMOS, Groningen molecular simulation and the outer region described with a molecular mechanics model (MM). However, only recently has this method started to provide the required level of accuracy (15Gao J. Lipkowitz K.B. Boyd D.B. Reviews in Computational Chemistry. 7. VCH Publishers, New York1996: 119-185Google Scholar, 16Monard G. Merz K.M. Acc. Chem. Res. 1999; 32: 904-911Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 17Laio A. Vande Vondele J. Röthlisberger U. J. Chem. Phys. 2002; 116: 6941-6947Crossref Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Our QM/MM approach combines two well established methodologies, namely density functional theory (DFT) (18Parr R.G. Yang W. Density-Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar) and the GROMOS force field (19van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hünenberger P.H. Krüger P. Mark A.E. Scott W.R.P. Tironi I.G. Biomolecular Simulation: The GROMOS96 Manual and User Guide.

ChemBioChem. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). We apply this method to the study of the restriction endonucleaseBamHI (1Cowan J.A. Chem.

Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and focus on the comparison of the activities of magnesium and calcium, which are experimentally known to act as cocatalyst and inhibitor, respectively, of the DNA cleavage reaction. This drastically different behavior of magnesium and calcium is quite common, and the reasons for it are largely unknown. The advantage that this specific system provides for a thorough investigation consists in the availability of x-ray structures that could be used as reference for our simulations: these structures refer to the complexes obtained by cocrystallizing the protein-DNA complex with calcium and with manganese 3The use of manganese is often meant to provide information on the analog case of magnesium, which is essentially invisible in x-ray measurements but is the natural, and thus most interesting, cocatalyst. and can be considered as representative of the pre- and postreactive states, respectively. In particular, by comparing the two states, the structure of the protein appeared to be largely insensitive to the reaction as evidenced by the overall root mean square displacement of only 0.33 Å between the Cα positions of the pre- and postreactive states. Two metal atoms (A and B) were observed at the active site, corroborating earlier proposals for a two-metal mechanism (4Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Science. 1995; 269: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), the nature of which will emerge clearly from our results. The QM subsystem was treated in the framework of DFT (18Parr R.G. Yang W. Density-Functional Theory of Atoms and Molecules. Oxford University Press, New York1989Google Scholar) using Becke's approximation (21Becke A.D. Phys. Rev. A. 1988; 38: 3098-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (45699) Google Scholar) for the exchange energy functional and the Lee-Yang-Parr approximation (22Lee C. Yang W. Parr R.G. Phys. Rev. B. 1988; 37: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (87769) Google Scholar) for the correlation energy functional. The QM calculations were performed with the Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) code 4CPMD: copyright IBM Corp. 1990, 1997, 2001 and Max-Planck-Institut für Festkörperforschung, Stuttgart, Germany, 1997; see www.cpmd.org. using a plane-wave basis set for the description of the valence electron wave functions (energy cut-off 70 Rydberg) and norm-conserving angular momentum-dependent pseudopotentials for the description of the core-valence interaction. The MM subsystem was treated within the GROMOS force field (19van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hünenberger P.H. Krüger P. Mark A.E. Scott W.R.P. Tironi I.G. Biomolecular Simulation: The GROMOS96 Manual and User Guide. VdF Hochschulverlag AG der ETH Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland1996Google Scholar), which is well established (see e.g.Ref. 23Daura X. Gademann K. Schäfer H. Jaun B. Seebach D. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2393-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) for the determination of both the structure and the dynamics of proteins in aqueous solutions (24Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar). The parametrization used corresponds to the 43A1 version of the force field. The interface between the two subsystems was modeled using the link-atom method (14Field M.J. Bash P.A. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1990; 11: 700-733Crossref Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The QM subsystem was enclosed in a box (of edges 43.36, 48.55, and 39.21 atomic units) and treated as an “embedded cluster” namely using the Hockney method (25Barnett R.N. Landman U. Phys. Rev. B. 1993; 48: 2081-2097Crossref Scopus (517) Google Scholar) and accounting for the influence of the MM subsystem via explicit calculations of van der Waals and electrostatic interactions. The electrostatic potential of the MM atoms was calculated in the QM region exactly within a cut-off radius of 15 Å and including a Poisson-Boltzmann reaction field correction (26Tironi I. Sperb R. Smith P.E. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 102: 5451-5459Crossref Scopus (1178) Google Scholar) outside. The influence of the QM atoms on the MM atoms was accounted for via the electrostatic interaction. The QM region was represented by a distribution of effective charges, which we obtained from fitting to the ab initio electrostatic potential using a novel and suitable procedure that avoids common errors due to inconsistency between quantum mechanically derived parameters and the rest of the force field (20Mordasini T. Curioni A. Bursi R. Andreoni W. ChemBioChem. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The initial structure is taken from the x-ray structure of the calcium complex (6Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entry 2BAM), and hydrogen atoms are added as required by the force field (19van Gunsteren W.F. Billeter S.R. Eising A.A. Hünenberger P.H. Krüger P. Mark A.E. Scott W.R.P. Tironi I.G. Biomolecular Simulation: The GROMOS96 Manual and User Guide. VdF Hochschulverlag AG der ETH Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland1996Google Scholar). The system was solvated in a rectangular box of 14,819 simple point charge water molecules (24Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar). Sodium ions were added in proximity of the DNA chain to provide charge neutralization. The optimization procedure (of the electronic and geometric variables) consisted of three consecutive steps. First the structure of the QM system was optimized keeping the positions of the MM atoms fixed, consistent with the experimental observation of a minor difference between pre- and postreactive states. Next the MM geometry was relaxed with molecular dynamics runs and optimized. The interaction with the QM system (fixed) was modeled as discussed above. Finally the structure of the QM subsystem was optimized again. Only minor changes were observed in these last two steps. In our simulations, the system is immersed in water to provide a realistic model (see Fig. 1) for the study of the enzymatic reaction. As the starting configuration, we used the crystallographic structure of the BamHI-DNA complex with calcium and optimized its structure (Fig. 2 b) in water; we then repeated this procedure after replacing calcium with magnesium (Fig. 2 a). As attacking agent, we considered a hydroxide generated either by a water molecule (4Newman M. Strzelecka T. Dorner L.F. Schildkraut I. Aggarwal A.K. Science. 1995; 269: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 6Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) deprotonated in situ (intrinsic mechanism) or by an external source (extrinsic mechanism) (27Fuxreiter M. Osman R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15017-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 refers only to the modeling of the latter reaction. In this case, only minor geometrical differences emerged in the initial states of the two enzymes apart from the expected decrease of the metal-oxygen distances (on average from 2.6 to 2.2 Å) on passing from calcium to magnesium. Water molecules are part of the metal coordination shell and are crucial to guarantee the preferred coordination number for both the A and B ions. If the hydroxide is replaced by a water molecule as attacking species, more significant differences between the A and B ion environments in the initial state as well as between those of calcium and magnesium are observed. For example, the magnesium B ion loses the phosphate O-2 oxygen as binding partner in a 5-fold coordination. However, the structural discrepancies we have detected in the prereactive states of the two metal-requiring proteins are minor and do not reflect a significantly different propensity of calcium and magnesium to donate electrons or polarize the surrounding bonding pattern. This is best illustrated by the spatial distribution of the charges obtained from the topological analysis of the electron density along the lines of Bader's theory (28Bader R.F.W. Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The atomic charges associated with the A and B ions are the same, and only a small difference is found between calcium and magnesium. Both A and B ions help stabilize a cluster distribution of negative charges localized at the active site. This is in agreement with the experimental observation of an enhancement of the stability of the protein-DNA complex in the presence of divalent ions (5Jen-Jacobson L. Biopolymers. 1997; 44: 153-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In the two-metal atom mechanism suggested in Ref.6Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, the role of the A ion is that of stabilizing hydroxyl ions generated by the Glu-113-driven deprotonation of water, and the failure of Ca2+ to act as cocatalyst was interpreted as failure to provide the concentration of metal-hydroxyl ions necessary for the nucleophilic attack because of an acidity lower than that of either Mg2+ or Mn2+. The stabilizing role of the A ion is confirmed by our calculations for magnesium, but the same is true for calcium. From our analysis, it has become clear that the active site does not contain any relevant feature in the initial state of the binding that could provide a simple explanation for the dramatically different behavior of magnesium and calcium.Figure 2Schematic representation of the optimized geometries in the close neighborhood of the scissile phosphate in the initial and transition states of the magnesium (a andc) and calcium (b andd) complexes. All distances are in Å.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Prereactive states of both magnesium (a) and calcium (b) complexes.The atomic charges obtained using Bader's approach (28Bader R.F.W. Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. Oxford University Press, New York1994Google Scholar) are shown in the range −2.0 (deep blue) to +2.0 (deep red). Values outside this range were condensed in the extremes for sake of clarity, and aliphatic hydrogen atoms were omitted. Also displayed is the charge distribution projected onto a plane containing the scissile bond. Note the strong similarity all over the region of the active site. Bader's atomic charges may differ only slightly from the nominal ionic charges, e.g. they are +2.0 for magnesium and +1.9 for calcium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We proceeded to investigate the reaction mechanisms and evaluate the energy profiles. For the phosphodiester cleavage by the hydroxide, be it extrinsic or intrinsic, we chose its approach distance to the phosphate as reaction coordinate. For the deprotonation of the water molecule, we selected its distance from the protonating amino acid (Glu-113 in Fig. 2). In the case of magnesium, the mere bond breaking induced by the hydroxide costs 14 kcal/mol in the extrinsic and 29 kcal/mol in the intrinsic process. Substantially higher energy barriers are obtained when magnesium is replaced by calcium, namely 31 and 52 kcal/mol, respectively. The presence of calcium instead of magnesium also increases, although to a lesser extent, the energy barrier relative to deprotonation of water in situ, namely from 20 to 26 kcal/mol. On the other hand, the cost to transfer a hydroxide from the bulk solution to the metal coordination shell, which is not explicitly calculated here, is expected to be only slightly different in the two cases. An estimate of the free energy change involved in this process can be obtained (29Fothergill M. Goodman M.F. Petruska J. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 29: 11619-11627Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar) from the difference between the pKa of the metal ion-bound water and the experimental external pH (30Engler L.E. Sapienza P. Dorner L.F. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Jen-Jacobson L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This amounts to about 5 kcal/mol for magnesium and 7 kcal/mol for calcium. In conclusion, our results unambiguously show that the kinetics of the reaction is decisive for the dramatically different behavior of the two divalent ions. Our calculations also show that the extrinsic mechanism is the most plausible one, which is consistent with recent model calculations of the free energy gain in the presence of the enzyme for the formation of the hydroxide in the two cases (27Fuxreiter M. Osman R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15017-15023Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). An activation free energy of ∼18 kcal/mol was derived from the measured value of the rate constant of the phosphodiester bond cleavage reaction (30Engler L.E. Sapienza P. Dorner L.F. Kucera R. Schildkraut I. Jen-Jacobson L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 619-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) catalyzed by the magnesium enzyme. If we subtract the amount due to the inclusion of the hydroxide in the system from it, we obtain a value of ∼13 kcal/mol. Comparison with our calculated value of ∼14 kcal/mol for the energy barrier indicates that the entropy contribution is minor. A complete understanding of the difference in the calculated energy barriers can be obtained by investigating the active site in the region of the “transition state” (Fig. 2, c andd). These structures show the presence of a trigonal bipyramid for the reacting moiety with both the attacking and leaving groups in axial positions. This is consistent with the geometry of the transition state involved in the hydrolysis of phosphate esters (31Dennis E.A. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1966; 88: 3432-3433Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Here the structural differences between the calcium and magnesium environments are much more pronounced than in the initial state, and their role in increasing the barrier for the transition to happen can now be detected. From our simulations of the active magnesium enzyme, it becomes clear that the role of the B ion is crucial in stabilizing the pentacoordinated transition state of the phosphate. In doing this, the B ion reduces its coordination with oxygen from six to four. This is what allows a water molecule to exit the coordination sphere of the metal and position itself to stabilize, via hydrogen bonding, another water molecule, which drives the final step of the reaction, i.e. the protonation of the O-3′ leaving group of the phosphate. An oxygen coordination shell of four is not so uncommon for magnesium. This is not the case for calcium, which tends to overcoordinate (with respect to a 6-fold coordination) rather than undercoordinate. In fact, when the system is forced to accommodate the pentacoordinated phosphate, resulting in a loosening of the bonding between the phosphate and the metal ion, the calcium B ion does not readjust its coordination but responds to keep all possible oxygen partners. Calcium thus fails to stabilize a situation that would be favorable for the transition to happen. As Fig. 2 d shows, the A ion also tends to increase its coordination, resulting in a strained rearrangement of the atoms around it in contrast to the case of the magnesium enzyme in which the A ion keeps a quasisymmetric octahedral structure during the entire reaction (see Fig. 2,a and c). All this explains the much higher energy required by the calcium complex with respect to the magnesium complex in allowing the final reaction to take place. These simulations have elucidated the mechanism by which magnesium ions coadjuvate the BamHI enzyme in cleaving the phosphodiester bond in DNA strands and finally unraveled why calcium ions inhibit the catalytic reaction. These findings have confirmed earlier suggestions (6Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) that a crucial role in the reaction is played by water molecules as well as by a second metal ion, beyond the one binding the attacking agent, and elucidated their concerted mode of action. This leads to a transition state with a configuration that perturbs the coordination shell of the metal ions in a way that is compatible with the binding mode of magnesium but not with that of calcium. On this basis, barriers lower than those for the calcium complex can reasonably be expected for complexes incorporating manganese, cobalt, zinc, and cadmium, which are more similar to magnesium and also act as cocatalysts (6Viadiu H. Aggarwal A.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Calculations from first principles were necessary to account for the nontrivial difference of the electronic structure of the two enzymes that drastically affects the kinetics of the reaction rather than the static properties of the prereactive states. The success of this investigation is largely due to our computational method, which relies on a careful description of all relevant interactions and on a sufficiently large size of the QM subsystem. In fact, as we have verified, reducing the size of the QM subsystem (50–100 atoms) drastically changes the nature of the frontier orbitals and thus the chemical behavior of the system, and ignoring dominant interactions with the MM region makes it unstable. The large discrepancy found in the values of the energy barriers of the enzyme with the two different metals (∼20 kcal/mol) is such that future enhancements of the accuracy of these calculations (e.g. an improvement of the DFT functional or a dynamic search for the transition state) will not alter the explanation we have provided here for their different chemical behavior. These results also reveal a new perspective on the large variety of enzymatic reactions relying on metal ion cofactors (1Cowan J.A. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1067-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and offer an efficient and accurate method that can now be confidently extended to verify several mechanistic hypotheses and to calculate specific physical quantities such as reaction activities. We are grateful to Andrea Califano and Ajay K. Royyuru for encouraging us to investigate this problem."

The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of bikunin-dependent signal transduction involved in the expression of a plasminogen activator (PA) system and invasion. We report here the following. 1) The human ovarian cancer cell line HRA produced secreted and cell-associated urokinase-type PA (uPA) and PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The plasma membrane of the cells showed enzymatically active uPA even in the presence of high level of PAI-1, as measured by zymography, Western blot, chromogenic assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Northern blot. 2) HRA cells leading to invasion are induced through up-regulation of uPA expression. 3) HRA cells specifically released transforming growth factor-β type 1 (TGF-β1) participating in an autocrine/paracrine regulation of cell invasion. 4) Elimination of endogenous TGF-β1 could induce change in uPA/PAI-1 expression, which could in turn modify the invasive behavior of the cells. 5) The constitutive expression of TGF-β1 as well as up-regulation of the PA system observed in HRA cells was inhibited by preinoculation of the cells with bikunin or calcium channel blocker SK&F 96365 but not with nifedipine or verapamil, with an IC50 of ∼100 nm for bikunin or ∼30 μm for SK&F 96365, respectively, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bikunin showed no additive effect on SK&F 96365-mediated suppression of TGF-β1 expression. 6) The ability of TGF-β1 to elevate free intracellular Ca2+, followed by activation of Src and ERK, was reduced by preincubation of the cells with bikunin. In conclusion, bikunin could inhibit the constitutive expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β1-mediated, Src- and ERK-dependent, PA system signaling cascade, at least in part, through inhibition of a non-voltage-sensitive calcium channel.

We report here the following. 1) The human ovarian cancer cell line HRA produced secreted and cell-associated urokinase-type PA (uPA) and PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1). The plasma membrane of the cells showed enzymatically active uPA even in the presence of high level of PAI-1, as measured by zymography, Western blot, chromogenic assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Northern blot. 2) HRA cells leading to invasion are induced through up-regulation of uPA expression. 3) HRA cells specifically released transforming growth factor-β type 1 (TGF-β1) participating in an autocrine/paracrine regulation of cell invasion. 4) Elimination of endogenous TGF-β1 could induce change in uPA/PAI-1 expression, which could in turn modify the invasive behavior of the cells. 5) The constitutive expression of TGF-β1 as well as up-regulation of the PA system observed in HRA cells was inhibited by preinoculation of the cells with bikunin or calcium channel blocker SK&F 96365 but not with nifedipine or verapamil, with an IC50 of ∼100 nm for bikunin or ∼30 μm for SK&F 96365, respectively, as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Bikunin showed no additive effect on SK&F 96365-mediated suppression of TGF-β1 expression. 6) The ability of TGF-β1 to elevate free intracellular Ca2+, followed by activation of Src and ERK, was reduced by preincubation of the cells with bikunin. In conclusion, bikunin could inhibit the constitutive expression of TGF-β1 and TGF-β1-mediated, Src- and ERK-dependent, PA system signaling cascade, at least in part, through inhibition of a non-voltage-sensitive calcium channel. plasminogen activator(s) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay extracellular signal-regulated kinase interleukin-1 c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase matrix metalloproteinase 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 4- amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine transforming growth factor-β tumor necrosis factor-α tissue-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor Tumor cell invasion is dependent on finely regulated extracellular proteolytic activity, which allows tumor cells to invade the extracellular matrix (1Fazioli F. Blasi F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 25-29Google Scholar). Among the proteolytic enzymes involved in this process are PAs,1 whose expression in cultured cells is regulated by several types of growth factors and cytokines (2Vlodavsky I. Korner G. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Bar-Shavit R. Fuks Z. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 203-226Google Scholar). Invasive tumor cells not only express cell-associated proteases but also secrete anti-proteases, preventing the overdigestion of the extracellular matrix, which leads to a loss of cell attachment. The balance between proteolytic activity and inhibition is crucial in the invasive and metastatic event (3Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906Google Scholar). Indeed, the increment of a specific PA inhibitor, PAI-1, could have an important regulatory role on the extracellular proteolysis and might explain the decrease of net PA and gelatinolytic activities measured in the medium (3Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906Google Scholar, 4Festuccia C. Angelucci A. Gravina G.L. Villanova I. Teti A. Albini A. Bologna M. Abini A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 407-415Google Scholar). Even in the high levels of PAI-1 in the medium, however, several growth factors, including TGF-β1, induced the increase of net PA and gelatinolytic activities on the plasma membrane, which results in strong proteolytic activity in some specific sites, such as areas of cell-to-cell or cell-to-extracellular matrix contacts. For this reason, drugs that manipulate or suppress signal transduction on the PA system in malignant cells offer a potentially new approach to anti-cancer therapy. One prototype signal transduction therapy agent is bikunin, which is a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor with tumor-suppressive potential in several malignant cell types, acting at the level of tumor invasion and metastasis (5Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Fujishiro S. Terao T. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar, 7Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Google Scholar). It was subsequently demonstrated that bikunin inhibits tumor invasion, at least in part, by a direct inhibition of plasmin activity as well as by inhibiting uPA (5Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Fujishiro S. Terao T. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar) and uPAR (7Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Google Scholar) expression at the gene and protein levels. Interestingly, in cell-free solutions, bikunin does not inhibit uPA activity effectively. Mechanistic studies in several cell types demonstrated that bikunin interferes with an upstream target(s) of selected MAP kinase signaling processes such as phosphorylation of MEK and ERK, leading to overexpression of uPA (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar). A recent study in our laboratory demonstrated that bikunin could interfere with selected calcium-sensitive signaling processes such as agonist-induced cytokine expression in several types of cells, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells, uterine myometrial cells, vascular endothelial cells, neutrophils, HL60 leukemia cells, and tumor cells (8Maehara K. Kanayama N. Halim A. el Maradny E. Oda T. Fujita M. Terao T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 927-934Google Scholar, 9Kanayama N. Maehara K. She L. Belayet H.M. Khatun S. Tokunaga N. Terao T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1381: 139-146Google Scholar). It has been established that calcium mobilization is a common signaling response in malignant and nonmalignant cells treated with a variety of growth factors, including TGF-β and TNF-α, which are associated with tumor progression (10Berridge M.J. Cancer Surv. 1986; 5: 413-430Google Scholar). These findings underscore the importance of calcium in the biology of malignant cells. We have been reported that in preclinical studies with several types of rodent and human malignant cells, bikunin has proven effective as an anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent (5Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Fujishiro S. Terao T. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar, 7Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Google Scholar). In recently completed clinical studies, bikunin has shown promise at stabilizing disease progression in patients with advanced ovarian cancer (11Kobayashi H. Nippon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi. 1996; 48 (in Japanese): 623-632Google Scholar). Despite the recent biochemical evidence that bikunin specifically inhibits expression of uPA and uPAR mRNA and proteins, the molecular mechanism underlying the tumor-suppressive effect of bikunin remains elusive. A growing body of evidence has recently implicated that members of TGF-β family are potent regulators of multiple cellular functions, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, organization, and death (4Festuccia C. Angelucci A. Gravina G.L. Villanova I. Teti A. Albini A. Bologna M. Abini A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 407-415Google Scholar, 12Arnoletti J.P. Albo D. Granick M.S. Solomon M.P. Castiglioni A. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Cancer. 1995; 76: 998-1005Google Scholar, 13Albo D. Berger D.H. Wang T.N. Hu X. Rothman V. Tuszynski G.P. Surgery. 1997; 122: 493-500Google Scholar). TGF-β1 is produced by host cells and/or tumor cells in a latent form and is activated by proteases in a cell-dependent manner. TGF-β1 produced by tumor cells including prostate cancer (4Festuccia C. Angelucci A. Gravina G.L. Villanova I. Teti A. Albini A. Bologna M. Abini A. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 407-415Google Scholar) and breast cancer (12Arnoletti J.P. Albo D. Granick M.S. Solomon M.P. Castiglioni A. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Cancer. 1995; 76: 998-1005Google Scholar, 13Albo D. Berger D.H. Wang T.N. Hu X. Rothman V. Tuszynski G.P. Surgery. 1997; 122: 493-500Google Scholar, 14Dong-Le Bourhis X. Lambrecht V. Boilly B. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-403Google Scholar) is a candidate responsible for the induction of PA system expression. Thus, TGF-β1 had a positive effect on cell proliferation and increased uPA or uPAR expression (15Shetty S. Kumar A. Johnson A. Pueblitz S. Idell S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L972-L982Google Scholar). The previous results (14Dong-Le Bourhis X. Lambrecht V. Boilly B. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 396-403Google Scholar) also indicated that the effects of TGF-β1 on cell growth can be dissociated from its effects on the uPA system and that TGF-β1 may promote invasion of tumor cells by increasing uPA activity and PAI-1 levels. In contrast, the TGF-β signaling pathway is considered to be one of the most important mechanisms for tumor suppression (16Schwarte-Waldhoff I. Klein S. Blass-Kampmann S. Hintelmann A. Eilert C. Dreschers S. Kalthoff H. Hahn S.A. Schmiegel W. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3152-3158Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of TGF-β1 on tumor cell invasion is controversial. In our experimental system, we chose the human ovarian cancer cell line HRA because these cells mediate plasminogen activation primarily by uPA but produce low amounts of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), and the cell invasion is a uPA-dependent. We examined whether bikunin can reduce cell invasion by modulating cell surface expression of PA system through suppression of tumor-associated production of cytokines, including TGF-β1. We also investigated whether bikunin can inhibit tumor-associated production of TGF-β1 and the TGF-β1-stimulated PA system through suppression of the calcium-dependent signaling. The human ovarian cancer cell line HRA was grown and cultured as described previously (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar). The HRA cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a cell culture incubator (constantly set at 37 °C with 5% CO2). Bikunin was purified from human urine as described previously (5Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Gotoh J. Fujie M. Fujishiro S. Terao T. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 72: 1131-1137Google Scholar, 6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar, 7Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Kanayama N. Nishida T. Takigawa M. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3945-3957Google Scholar). Reagents of molecular biology grade for protein gel electrophoresis, protein staining, and protein concentration analysis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Proteolytic enzymes, protease substrates, and specific protease inhibitors were obtained from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT) and include recombinant single-chain tPA, high molecular weight recombinant uPA, synthetic chromogenic substrate of uPA (Spectrozyme UK), synthetic chromogenic substrate of tPA (Spectrozyme TPA), Glu-type plasminogen, purified plasmin, chromogenic plasmin substrate (Spectrozyme PL), purified tPA-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (374B), purified uPA-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (394), and anti-PAI-1 antibody (379). Monoclonal antibodies against MMP-2 and MMP-9 were from Oncogene Science (Cambridge, MA) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the total and phosphorylated ERK were from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA) andCalbiochem, respectively. Polyclonal antibodies that recognize the total and phosphorylated (activated) forms of JNK and p38 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Ultrapure natural human TGF-β1 was from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA) and R & D Systems. Neutralizing antibody against TGF-β1 was purchased from R & D Systems and Sigma. Neutralizing mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies to TNF-α or IL-1 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). MEK inhibitor PD98059 was from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Matrigel was purchased from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). PP2 (Calbiochem), genistein, nifedipine, sodium vanadate, and verapamil were from Sigma. SK&F 96365 was obtained from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. The final dimethyl sulfoxide concentration was held constant throughout each experiment at either 0.5% or 1%. Control experiments indicated that neither of these dimethyl sulfoxide concentrations affected gene expression or cell viability. Unless otherwise specified, all other chemicals and reagents were of the highest purity and obtained from Sigma. Cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and basically 24 h later washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then treated with several reagents, including bikunin or TGF-β1 in serum-free medium. The conditioned medium was produced by incubating the cells (∼90% confluent) for 24 h in a serum-free medium. All conditioned medium thus obtained was concentrated ∼10-fold in Centricon-10 units (Amicon). The cell monolayers were extracted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 (v/v) in the presence of inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) at 4 °C for 15 min and scraped with a rubber policeman. Cell extracts were then centrifuged at 3,000 ×g to remove cell debris. All samples were stored at −20 °C until use. In parallel, cells treated in the same condition in different dishes were harvested and counted using a hemocytometer. The amount of uPA was measured in the cell-conditioned medium and in the cell lysate using an Imubind uPA ELISA kit from American Diagnostica. PAI-1 levels in the cell-conditioned medium were determined using an Imubind PAI-1 ELISA kit from the same vendor. Lower detection levels were set at 10 pg/ml for the uPA kit and below 1 ng/ml for the PAI-1 kit. The active and total (active plus latent) TGF-β1 were assayed with a human TGF-β1 ELISA kit (BIOSOURCE International Company, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure total TGF-β1, samples were acidified with acetic acid and then neutralized as described previously (17Zhang H. Morisaki T. Matsunaga H. Sato N. Uchiyama A. Hashizume K. Nagumo F. Tadano J. Katano M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 2000; 18: 343-352Google Scholar). HRA cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well in 96-well plates in the maintenance medium and allowed to reach ∼90% confluence. The cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed in a reaction buffer (100 μl/well) containing 0.8 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin. The reactions were initiated by the addition of the chromogenic amidolytic substrate specific for either uPA (Spectrozyme UK) or tPA (Spectrozyme TPA) to a final concentration of 0.2 mm in the absence or presence of 1 mm amiloride or neutralizing antibodies to 10 μg/ml uPA or 10 μg/ml tPA. No amidolytic substrate was added in the blank reactions. The photometric absorbance of the reaction mixtures at 405 nm was monitored at 37 °C over the next 30 min. The trypan blue cell staining procedure was performed as described by Broman et al. (18Broman T. Grontoft O. Steinwall O. Acta Neurol. Scand. 1965; 41: 527-538Google Scholar). Plasmin activities in cell-conditioned medium and cell lysate were determined spectrophotometrically using a Spectrozyme PL as described (12Arnoletti J.P. Albo D. Granick M.S. Solomon M.P. Castiglioni A. Rothman V.L. Tuszynski G.P. Cancer. 1995; 76: 998-1005Google Scholar). Cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning Costar Corp.). After 2 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with the indicated concentrations of TGF-β1 for 24 h in serum-free medium. Four h before the end of culture, cells were incubated with 2 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (ICN, specific activity 2 Ci/mm). Cells were then washed with 10% trichloroacetic acid at 4 °C followed by four washes with water and solubilized with 0.5 m sodium hydroxide; the radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter (LKB). HRA cells were grown on a flat bottomed 96-well plate at 10,000 cells/well containing the complete medium including 10% fetal bovine serum. 24 h later, cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium with or without several reagents. After 1, 3, and 5 days of culture, cell proliferation was assayed by the addition of 20 μg of the vital dye MTT (1 mg/ml; Sigma). The blue dye taken up by cells during a 4-h culture was dissolved in 100 μl/well dimethyl sulfoxide, and its A 490 nm was read on an automated microplate reader. A preliminary study by MTT assay showed that absorbance was directly proportional to the number of cells. Confluent monolayers of HRA cells in 35-mm tissue culture dishes were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated for 12 h in the presence of serum-free medium, the indicated concentrations of TGF-β1, neutralizing antibodies to TGF-β1, TNF-α, IL-1β, or preimmune IgG. At the end of the incubation, cell extracts and supernatants were analyzed by zymography as described (19Festuccia C. Guerra F. D'Ascenzo S. Giunciuglio D. Albini A. Bologna M. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 75: 418-431Google Scholar). Conditioned medium (10 μl of 10 × concentrated) and 20 μg of cell lysate were electrophoresed in nonreducing SDS-PAGE conditions in gel copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin for gelatinase activities and with 0.1% casein plus 15 μg/ml Glu-plasminogen for PA activities. Plasminogen-dependent gelatinolytic zymogram was performed as described previously (20Heussen C. Dowdle E.B. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 196-202Google Scholar). HRA cells were cultured and serum starved. Treatment was achieved by adding 0.5–50 μm SK&F 96365 to the medium for 20 h. In addition, cells were incubated for 12 h with one of the following agents: 50 μm MEK inhibitor PD98059, 50 μm l-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine or verapamil, 25 μm general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein, or 10 μm selective Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2. Control cells received just vehicle (0.1–0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide for PD98059, SK&F 96365, genistein, and PP2; 0.1% ethanol for nifedipine and verapamil). The HRA cells were plated at a density of 106 cells/100-mm dish. When cells grown in monolayer reached an early phase of confluence, total cellular RNA samples were isolated from cells using a Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analysis, 20 μg of cytoplasmic RNA was electrophoresed onto a formaldehyde and 1.0% agarose gel and blotted onto a nylon filter. After transfer, RNA was cross-linked onto the membranes by UV irradiation. The nylon filter was hybridized with a32P-labeled cDNA probe in 50% formamide, 5 × saline-sodium phosphate, EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 5 × Denhardt's solution, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C for 20 h. Quantitative analysis was performed with a Bio-Rad model 620 video densitometer with a one-dimensional Analyst software package for Macintosh. The uPA cDNA probe was prepared as described previously (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar). The β-actin probe was an XhoI-XhoI fragment of pHFβA-1 for (ATCC, Rockville, MD). For pSP64-hPAI-1, a 1.4-kbpEcoRI-BglII fragment (position 54–1480 (Ref.21Pannekoek H. Veerman H. Lambers H. Diergaarde P. Verweij C.L. van Zonneveld A.J. van Mourik J.A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2539-2544Google Scholar)) isolated from pPAI1-C1, a plasmid containing a 2.2-kbp human PAI-1 cDNA insert (22Andreasen P.A. Riccio A. Welinder K.G. Douglas R. Sartorio R. Nielsen L.S. Oppenheimer C. Blasi F. Dano K. FEBS Lett. 1986; 209: 213-218Google Scholar), was subcloned between the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pSP64 (23Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Google Scholar). For pSP65-hTA, a 614-bpBglII-EcoRI fragment (position 188–801) isolated from pW349F, a plasmid containing a 2.6-kbp human tPA cDNA insert (24Fisher R. Waller E.K. Grossi G. Thompson D. Tizard R. Schleuning W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11223-11230Google Scholar), was subcloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pSP65 (23Melton D.A. Krieg P.A. Rebagliati M.R. Maniatis T. Zinn K. Green M.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7035-7056Google Scholar). The SmaI-NcoI fragment pf a PCR product, which encompasses 634–886 bp of MMP-2 cDNA, was subcloned into the pGem5 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). A PCR fragment, which encompasses 151–442 bp of MMP-9 cDNA, was subcloned into the pGem-T vector (Promega). Confirmation of the presence of uPA, PAI-1, and MMP expression was obtained by Western blot using each monoclonal antibody. Briefly, samples were electrophoresed under nonreducing (for uPA and PAI-1) and reducing (for MMPs) conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semidry transfer system. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.6, containing 2% bovine serum albumin. Blots were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml primary antibody for 1 h and with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG diluted 1: 5,000 in blocking solution) for 1 h. After several washes, reactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The ability of cells to migrate across a Matrigel barrier (invasion) was determined by the modified Boyden chamber method (25Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245Google Scholar). Briefly, HRA cells (105/chamber) were added to polyvinylpyrrolidone-free, 8-μm polycarbonate filters coated with 50 μl of 50 μg/ml Matrigel and incubated with complete medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 36 h at 37 °C. NIH3T3 fibroblast-conditioned medium was used as a chemoattractant, and serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin was used as a negative control. Filters were removed from the chambers and stained with hematoxylin. Cells were counted at a 100× magnification, and the mean numbers of cells/field in five random fields were recorded. Duplicate filters were used, and the experiments were repeated three times. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent triplicate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Student'st test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The human ovarian cancer cell line HRA was chosen for our study because we have shown previously that HRA cells exhibited a uPA-dependent invasion and metastasis (6Kobayashi H. Suzuki M. Tanaka Y. Hirashima Y. Terao T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2015-2022Google Scholar). In this study, HRA cells were evaluated for their capability to secrete and activate PAs and MMPs in great detail. Fig. 1,A and B, shows the zymographic profiles of the plasminogen-dependent (for PA (A)) and plasminogen-independent (for MMP (B)) gelatinolytic activities of both the cell lysate and the conditioned medium (10× concentrated) of HRA cells. Compared with the purified tPA, uPA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 standards, both the lysate and the conditioned medium of HRA cells contained primarily uPA, although a trace amount of tPA was also detected (Fig. 1 A). Gelatin zymography (Fig. 1 B) and Western blotting (not shown) indicate that HRA cells basally secreted detectable but low amounts of 92- and 65-kDa gelatinases whose positions identify the produced molecules as pro-MMP-9 and pro-MMP-2 (Fig. 1 B). As shown in Fig. 1, C andD, analysis of the uPA and PAI-1 levels using Western blotting showed a band of 33 kDa (for low molecular mass uPA), 50 kDa (for high molecular mass uPA), 60 kDa (for PAI-1), 110 kDa (for uPA·PAI-1 complex), and 130 kDa (for tPA·PAI-1 complex) in the conditioned medium and the cell lysate. Moreover, HRA cells produced extremely low amounts of PAI-2 as revealed by ELISA (data not shown). ELISA data showed that the basal cell-associated uPA protein level measured in HRA cells was 14.8 ± 2.1 ng/mg cell lysate protein (mean ± S.D.), whereas the basal level of uPA released in the medium by the cells during a 24-h period was 12.0 ± 3.8 ng/ml/106 cells/24 h. Furthermore, the cells also produced cell-associated PAI-1 and secreted PAI-1 (5.2 ± 1.7 ng/mg protein for cell-associated PAI-1; 30.2 ± 8.7 ng/ml/106cells/24 h for secreted PAI-1). The conditioned medium of HRA cells was not very active in converting Glu-plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn did not lead to the cleavage of Spectrozyme PL. In contrast, when Spectrozyme UK or Spectrozyme TPA was added to the monolayer of HRA cells, the Spectrozyme UK was specifically cleaved (Fig. 1 E). 1 mm amiloride (a catalytic inhibitor of uPA) and 10 μg/ml uPA-neutralizing antibody, but not 10 μg/ml tPA-neutralizing antibody, blocked the cleavage of Spectrozyme UK on the plasma membrane of the HRA cells. It is worth noting that throughout this biochemical assay, cells remained intact, showing little or no plasma membrane permeability by trypan blue and a full recovery of proliferation in the subsequent cell growth assay (data not shown). Effects of bikunin at concentrations from 1 to 1,000 nm on the cell proliferation were tested in dose-response and time course experiments over a 14-day period. Bikunin concentrations varying from 1 to 1,000 nm did not show any significant effect on growth (data not shown). Thus, the invasion assay could be performed at a time (36 h) when there was no growth inhibition. To test whether the HRA cells had an ability to invade by a PA system-dependent manner, cells were preincubated with E64 and amiloride as well as specific neutralizing antibodies to uPA, tPA, MMP-2, or MMP-9 and analyzed using a chemoinvasion assay. As shown in Fig. 2, the uPA-neutralizing antibody specifically inhibited HRA cell invasion in a dose-dependent manner. Antibody against uPA A-chain 3471 (containing the domain interacting with uPA receptor) also strongly blocked the invasion. We have shown previously that bikunin inhibits the in vitro invasion of several types of cancer cells, including HRA cells. Cells preincubated with the uPA-neutralizing antibody were not inhibited further by bikunin in the Matrigel invasion assay. Neutralizing antibodies to tPA, MMP-2, and MMP-9 neither inhibited cell invasion nor altered the invasion-inhibitory effect of bikunin (data not shown). In addition, enhanced invasion of HRA cells was inhibited markedly by the uPA-specific inhibitor, amiloride. E64, which totally inhibits soluble cathepsins and uPA, had a weak inhibitory effect. We next examined whether the uPA level is modulated by bikunin in the medium collected from the upper chamber during the invasion experiment. The presence of bikunin caused a dramatic reduction of the uPA level (107 ± 21.5 [+bikunin] versus 283 ± 43.6 pg/ml/105 cells/36 h [−bikunin]). At a concentration of 1 μm, the uPA level is inhibited by 62%. These data support that the HRA cells leading to invasion are induced through up-regulation of uPA expression and a specific inhibitory activ"

Through yeast two-hybrid screening we have cloned and characterized a new signaling molecule, Unc119, that associates with IL-5Rα and Src family tyrosine kinases. Unc119 induces the catalytic activity of these kinases through interaction with Src homology 2 and 3 domains. IL-5 stimulation of eosinophils increases Unc119 association with Lyn and induces its catalytic activity. Lyn is important for eosinophil survival. Eosinophils that are transduced with Unc119 have increased Lyn activity and demonstrate prolonged survival in the absence of IL-5. Inhibition of Unc119 down-regulates eosinophil survival. To our knowledge Unc119 is the first receptor-associated activator of Src family tyrosine kinases. Lyn, an Src-type tyrosine kinase, is associated with the interleukin (IL)-5 receptor in eosinophils.

Many receptors rely upon kinases, especially tyrosine kinases, for receptor phosphorylation and activation of signaling cascades. The Src family tyrosine kinases (SrcTKs)1 frequently serve as the trigger mechanism for cytosolic signals (1Sefton B.M. Taddie J.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 372-379Google Scholar). Receptor-associated SrcTKs exist in a non-active conformation and become transiently activated following ligand binding and receptor oligomerization (2DeFranco A.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 163-175Google Scholar). How receptor oligomerization leads to the activation of SrcTKs is unknown.Two intramolecular interactions tightly regulate structural conformation and enzymatic activity of SrcTKs. One is through Src homology 2 (SH2) and the other is through the SH3 domain. All cellular SrcTKs have a C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr527 for Src). Phosphorylated Tyr527forms an intramolecular interaction with the SH2 domain of the kinase (3Liu X. Brodeur S.R. Gish G. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Laudano A.P. Pawson T. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1119-1126Google Scholar). This interaction decreases the kinase activity. Dephosphorylation of this tyrosine residue by phosphatases such as CD45 is required but is not sufficient for kinase activation (4McFarland E.D. Hurley T.R. Pingel J.T. Sefton B.M. Shaw A. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1402-1406Google Scholar). Receptor-bound SrcTKs are frequently found to be dephosphorylated under basal conditions, yet lack appreciable catalytic activity (5Hurley T.R. Hyman R. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1651-1656Google Scholar). CD45-negative cells have variable effects on SrcTKs. CD45 negatively regulates Lyn by dephosphorylating both its negative and positive regulatory tyrosine residues (6Katagiri T. Ogimoto M. Hasegawa K. Arimura Y. Mitomo K. Okada M. Clark M.R. Mizuno K. Yakura H. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1321-1326Google Scholar). The activity of Lyn and Hck is increased in macrophages (7Yanagi S. Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Sabe H. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30487-30492Google Scholar) and B cells (8Roach T. Slater S. Koval M. White L. Cahir McFarland E.D. Okumura M. Thomas M. Brown E. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 408-417Google Scholar) lacking CD45.Regulation of SrcTK activity through other intramolecular interactions was realized after the crystal structures of Src (9Xu W. Doshi A. Lei M. Eck M.J. Harrison S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 629-638Google Scholar) and Hck (10Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Google Scholar) were solved. The linker region that is located between the SH2 and the kinase domains binds to the SH3 domain of the kinase rendering a non-active conformation. Furthermore, a short amino acid stretch connecting the SH2 and SH3 domains has recently been identified as an additional negative regulator of Hck and Src activation (11Young M.A. Gonfloni S. Superti-Furga G. Roux B. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2001; 105: 115-126Google Scholar). The SH3 domain of SrcTKs prefers to bind to the RXXPXXP motif (a motif is defined as a short stretch of amino acid residues that binds to a signaling domain) (12Alexandropoulos K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3110-3114Google Scholar, 13Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Google Scholar). Although the linkers of SrcTK bind to the SH3 domain, they do not have an optimal SH3-binding motif. Src and Fyn do not even have the second proline residue in the motif (13Rickles R.J. Botfield M.C. Weng Z. Taylor J.A. Green O.M. Brugge J.S. Zoller M.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5598-5604Google Scholar). Although Lyn has the canonical PXXP motif (amino acids 230–233) like all other SrcTKs, it lacks the flanking arginine residue. This “imperfect” SH3 motif with low affinity binding can be easily displaced by a high affinity SH3 ligand. Accordingly, the exogenous SH3 ligand Nef (a human immunodeficiency virus protein) activates Hck, a member of SrcTKs, in an SH3 motif-dependent manner (14Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. et al.Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Google Scholar). However, the identity of endogenous SH3 ligands that activate SrcTKs is largely unknown.Our laboratory has been interested in the signal transduction mechanism of IL-5R, which is composed of a unique α and a common β subunit (15Tavernier J. Devos R. Cornelis S. Tuypens T. Van der Heyden J. Fiers W. Plaetinck G. Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Google Scholar). The earliest event of IL-5R signaling in eosinophils is the activation of SrcTKs and Janus kinases (16Coffer P.J. Schweizer R.C. Dubois G.R. Maikoe T. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Blood. 1998; 91: 2547-2557Google Scholar, 17Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Google Scholar, 18Pazdrak K. Stafford S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 397-402Google Scholar). One of the SrcTKs that plays a dominant role in eosinophils is Lyn kinase. We and others (19Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Google Scholar, 21Stafford S. Lowell C. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1978-1983Google Scholar) have shown that Lyn is important for eosinophil survival and differentiation. The molecular mechanism of activation of Lyn kinase by IL-5 receptor is unknown.DISCUSSIONLyn, a member of SrcTKs, plays an important role in many hematopoietic cells, especially in B cells (33Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Google Scholar), mast cells (34Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Google Scholar), and eosinophils (17Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Google Scholar). The activation of eosinophils through the IL-5 receptor is critically dependent upon Lyn kinase (19Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Google Scholar, 21Stafford S. Lowell C. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1978-1983Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of Lyn following receptor stimulation is unknown. We have cloned Unc119 using the IL-5Rα subunit as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. Unc119 has SH2- and SH3-binding motifs. It associates with IL-5Rα and Lyn kinase in eosinophils. More importantly, it activates Lyn kinase in an SH2- and SH3-dependent manner. Unc119 also binds to Hck but not to Itk or PI3K p110γ. Furthermore, it does not interact with the SH2 or SH3 domains of Grb2 and Shc, respectively. The SH3 motif peptide of Unc119 activates both Lyn and Hck suggesting that a common principle is applicable to Unc119 interaction with SrcTKs. Interestingly Itk, which has both SH2 and SH3 domains, does not bind to nor is activated by Unc119. The results suggest the existence of microspecificity of SH3 interaction with their ligands.Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that only a small fraction of Unc119 is associated with Lyn in vivo (Fig. 3 A). The result may suggest that this association is physiologically not important. However, because the binding of Unc119 leads to the activation of Lyn, it is likely that Unc119 associates with Lyn only transiently. Indeed, the association of Unc119 with Lyn increases after IL-5 stimulation (Fig. 5 A). The Unc119-associated Lyn shows increased kinase activity. More importantly, the entire activable and detergent-soluble Lyn fraction is associated with Unc119 following IL-5 stimulation.Unc119 (also known as HRG4 for human retinal gene protein 4) was originally cloned as a retina-specific gene (25Higashide T. Inana G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 446-450Google Scholar). It had been localized in ribbon synapses of retina (35Higashide T. McLaren M.J. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 690-698Google Scholar). It has 57% homology to theunc-119 gene from Caenorhabditis elegans, which is expressed in the neural tissue and is involved in feeding, locomotion, and chemosensation of the nematode (36Maduro M. Genetics. 1995; 141: 977-988Google Scholar). Recently, a single patient with cone-rod dystrophy who expressed a truncated form of HRG4 has been identified (37Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277Google Scholar). This patient is heterozygous, and it is not clear from the report whether this patient displays any other abnormalities. Rhodopsin promoter-driven overexpression of this truncated HRG4 in the retina causes its degeneration in mice (37Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277Google Scholar). The foregoing observation is exciting and clearly indicates an important role for HRG4/Unc119 in retina. However, the exact function of HRG4/Unc119 in retina and other organs remains unknown.Crystallographic studies predict that the binding of the SH3 domain to an external SH3 ligand would release the linker region leading to a conformational change in the kinase domain and its activation. Indeed, studies using human immunodeficiency virus Nef, an exogenous SH3 ligand, have demonstrated robust activation of SrcTKs in vitro (14Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. et al.Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Google Scholar). Nef is not the only SH3 ligand that activates SrcTKs. Two cell surface receptors, CD28 and CD2, have proline-rich sequences that conform to the SH3-binding motif. In support of our findings both CD28 and CD2 activate Lck and Fyn, respectively, in an SH3 motif-dependent manner (31Holdorf A.D. Green J.M. Levin S.D. Denny M.F. Straus D.B. Link V. Changelian P.S. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 375-384Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) can directly activate Src and Hck (38Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Google Scholar). Unc119 is not the first molecule that binds an Src-type kinase at two sites and regulates its function. It has been shown that p130Cas (Csk-associated substrate) binds Src kinase through its SH2 and SH3 domains (39Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Google Scholar). The binding through the SH3 domain activates Src. A mutation in the SH3-binding motif of p130Cas causes significant reduction in Src kinase activity (39Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Google Scholar). We have seen activation of Lyn by both SH2 and SH3 peptides. However, higher concentrations of the SH2 peptide are needed to activate Lyn. We speculate that the SH3-binding motif may be physiologically more relevant than the SH2-binding motif for Lyn activation.Unc119 and Unc119-derived motif peptides induce autophosphorylation of Lyn as well as kinase activity for the substrate. However, we have observed that autophosphorylation occurs at a concentration of Unc119 that is frequently lower than required for the induction of kinase activity. The discrepancy between autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation has been noted previously by other investigators (40Singh R.A. Zang Y.C. Shrivastava A. Hong J. Wang G.T. Li S. Tejada-Simon M.V. Kozovska M. Rivera V.M. Zhang J.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6393-6402Google Scholar). The interplay between autophosphorylation and kinase activity of SrcTKs is very complex and is dependent upon multiple factors including divalent cation and ATP concentrations and affinity for substrates and activators. This complex process was recently investigated by Sunet al. (41Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Google Scholar), who demonstrated that autophosphorylation of Src is inhibited during the peak of substrate phosphorylation.One of the important functions of IL-5 and other growth factors is to delay eosinophil apoptosis and prolong eosinophil survival. Lyn kinase has been shown previously (19Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Google Scholar) to play a non-redundant role in this process. Inhibition of Lyn blocks eosinophil survival. When transduced into eosinophils Unc119 activated Lyn kinase and inhibited eosinophil apoptosis in the absence of growth factors. The anti-Unc119 antibody blocks eosinophil survival suggesting that Unc119 is important for Lyn activation in vivo. In other work2 we have demonstrated that overexpression of Unc119 induces activation of Lck and Fyn in T cells. Unc119-deficient cells are unable to activate Lck and Fyn following T cell stimulation. As a consequence these cells are unable to produce IL-2 and proliferate poorly. Thus, Unc119 appears to be a receptor-associated activator of SrcTKs. We believe that in eosinophils Unc119 and Lyn form an inactive complex with IL-5Rα under basal conditions, and Unc119 is inaccessible to the Lyn SH3 domain. Receptor activation changes the conformation allowing the association of Unc119 with the Lyn SH3 domain and leading to kinase activation. The association through the SH2 domain may have an additive effect. By activating SrcTKs Unc119 may provide a novel signal-generating mechanism for receptors and, therefore, may have broad biological relevance. One of the fundamental goals of cell biology is to understand the mechanism of signal generation by receptors. Many receptors rely upon kinases, especially tyrosine kinases, for receptor phosphorylation and activation of signaling cascades. The Src family tyrosine kinases (SrcTKs)1 frequently serve as the trigger mechanism for cytosolic signals (1Sefton B.M. Taddie J.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 372-379Google Scholar).

Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277Google Scholar). This patient is heterozygous, and it is not clear from the report whether this patient displays any other abnormalities. Rhodopsin promoter-driven overexpression of this truncated HRG4 in the retina causes its degeneration in mice (37Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D. Kubota S. Sakuma H. An W. Fujimaki T. McLaren M.J. Weleber R.G. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 3268-3277Google Scholar). The foregoing observation is exciting and clearly indicates an important role for HRG4/Unc119 in retina. However, the exact function of HRG4/Unc119 in retina and other organs remains unknown.Crystallographic studies predict that the binding of the SH3 domain to an external SH3 ligand would release the linker region leading to a conformational change in the kinase domain and its activation. Indeed, studies using human immunodeficiency virus Nef, an exogenous SH3 ligand, have demonstrated robust activation of SrcTKs in vitro (14Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. et al.Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Google Scholar). Nef is not the only SH3 ligand that activates SrcTKs. Two cell surface receptors, CD28 and CD2, have proline-rich sequences that conform to the SH3-binding motif. In support of our findings both CD28 and CD2 activate Lck and Fyn, respectively, in an SH3 motif-dependent manner (31Holdorf A.D. Green J.M. Levin S.D. Denny M.F. Straus D.B. Link V. Changelian P.S. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 375-384Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein) can directly activate Src and Hck (38Ma Y.C. Huang J. Ali S. Lowry W. Huang X.Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 635-646Google Scholar). Unc119 is not the first molecule that binds an Src-type kinase at two sites and regulates its function. It has been shown that p130Cas (Csk-associated substrate) binds Src kinase through its SH2 and SH3 domains (39Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Google Scholar). The binding through the SH3 domain activates Src. A mutation in the SH3-binding motif of p130Cas causes significant reduction in Src kinase activity (39Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Google Scholar). We have seen activation of Lyn by both SH2 and SH3 peptides. However, higher concentrations of the SH2 peptide are needed to activate Lyn. We speculate that the SH3-binding motif may be physiologically more relevant than the SH2-binding motif for Lyn activation.Unc119 and Unc119-derived motif peptides induce autophosphorylation of Lyn as well as kinase activity for the substrate. However, we have observed that autophosphorylation occurs at a concentration of Unc119 that is frequently lower than required for the induction of kinase activity. The discrepancy between autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation has been noted previously by other investigators (40Singh R.A. Zang Y.C. Shrivastava A. Hong J. Wang G.T. Li S. Tejada-Simon M.V. Kozovska M. Rivera V.M. Zhang J.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6393-6402Google Scholar). The interplay between autophosphorylation and kinase activity of SrcTKs is very complex and is dependent upon multiple factors including divalent cation and ATP concentrations and affinity for substrates and activators. This complex process was recently investigated by Sunet al. (41Sun G. Ramdas L. Wang W. Vinci J. McMurray J. Budde R.J. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 397: 11-17Google Scholar), who demonstrated that autophosphorylation of Src is inhibited during the peak of substrate phosphorylation.One of the important functions of IL-5 and other growth factors is to delay eosinophil apoptosis and prolong eosinophil survival. Lyn kinase has been shown previously (19Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Google Scholar) to play a non-redundant role in this process. Inhibition of Lyn blocks eosinophil survival. When transduced into eosinophils Unc119 activated Lyn kinase and inhibited eosinophil apoptosis in the absence of growth factors. The anti-Unc119 antibody blocks eosinophil survival suggesting that Unc119 is important for Lyn activation in vivo. In other work2 we have demonstrated that overexpression of Unc119 induces activation of Lck and Fyn in T cells. Unc119-deficient cells are unable to activate Lck and Fyn following T cell stimulation. As a consequence these cells are unable to produce IL-2 and proliferate poorly. Thus, Unc119 appears to be a receptor-associated activator of SrcTKs. We believe that in eosinophils Unc119 and Lyn form an inactive complex with IL-5Rα under basal conditions, and Unc119 is inaccessible to the Lyn SH3 domain. Receptor activation changes the conformation allowing the association of Unc119 with the Lyn SH3 domain and leading to kinase activation. The association through the SH2 domain may have an additive effect. By activating SrcTKs Unc119 may provide a novel signal-generating mechanism for receptors and, therefore, may have broad biological relevance. Lyn, a member of SrcTKs, plays an important role in many hematopoietic cells, especially in B cells (33Burg D.L. Furlong M.T. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28136-28142Google Scholar), mast cells (34Yamashita T. Mao S.Y. Metzger H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11251-11255Google Scholar), and eosinophils (17Pazdrak K. Schreiber D. Forsythe P. Justement L. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1827-1834Google Scholar). The activation of eosinophils through the IL-5 receptor is critically dependent upon Lyn kinase (19Pazdrak K. Olszewska-Pazdrak B. Stafford S. Garofalo R.P. Alam R. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 421-429Google Scholar, 20Yousefi S. Hoessli D.C. Blaser K. Mills G.B. Simon H.U. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1407-1414Google Scholar, 21Stafford S. Lowell C. Sur S. Alam R. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1978-1983Google Scholar). The mechanism of activation of Lyn following receptor stimulation is unknown. We have cloned Unc119 using the IL-5Rα subunit as the bait in the yeast two-hybrid screening. Unc119 has SH2- and SH3-binding motifs. It associates with IL-5Rα and Lyn kinase in eosinophils. More importantly, it activates Lyn kinase in an SH2- and SH3-dependent manner. Unc119 also binds to Hck but not to Itk or PI3K p110γ. Furthermore, it does not interact with the SH2 or SH3 domains of Grb2 and Shc, respectively. The SH3 motif peptide of Unc119 activates both Lyn and Hck suggesting that a common principle is applicable to Unc119 interaction with SrcTKs. Interestingly Itk, which has both SH2 and SH3 domains, does not bind to nor is activated by Unc119. The results suggest the existence of microspecificity of SH3 interaction with their ligands. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that only a small fraction of Unc119 is associated with Lyn in vivo (Fig. 3 A). The result may suggest that this association is physiologically not important. However, because the binding of Unc119 leads to the activation of Lyn, it is likely that Unc119 associates with Lyn only transiently. Indeed, the association of Unc119 with Lyn increases after IL-5 stimulation (Fig. 5 A). The Unc119-associated Lyn shows increased kinase activity. More importantly, the entire activable and detergent-soluble Lyn fraction is associated with Unc119 following IL-5 stimulation. Unc119 (also known as HRG4 for human retinal gene protein 4) was originally cloned as a retina-specific gene (25Higashide T. Inana G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 446-450Google Scholar). It had been localized in ribbon synapses of retina (35Higashide T. McLaren M.J. Inana G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1998; 39: 690-698Google Scholar). It has 57% homology to theunc-119 gene from Caenorhabditis elegans, which is expressed in the neural tissue and is involved in feeding, locomotion, and chemosensation of the nematode (36Maduro M. Genetics. 1995; 141: 977-988Google Scholar). Recently, a single patient with cone-rod dystrophy who expressed a truncated form of HRG4 has been identified (37Kobayashi A. Higashide T. Hamasaki D.

The development of high throughput assays for these genomic pseudotargets may be a challenging but important step for not limiting drug discovery to the “relatively easy” targets such as G-protein-coupled receptors or particular enzymes. An alternative or complementary effort is the construction of high quality chemical libraries that generate bioactive molecules at higher rates. The small size of the focused libraries would lower the cost of screening processes and enable unique low throughput screens, extending the scope of assays for the genomic targets and for a given therapeutic effect. Our approach to constructing a focused chemical library is based on the logic of genetics. In genetic screens, clear morphological phenotypes are often used just as a sensitive tool for discovering and analyzing genes whose primary functions are seemingly unrelated to the morphological phenotype. A good example is the use of eye morphology in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a genetic tool for the analysis of genes in disease-linked signaling pathways (1Thomas B.J. Wassarman D.A. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 184-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Although human diseases associated with these pathways, such as cancer and neurodegenerative diseases, are seemingly unrelated to eye development, the use of eye morphology as a sensitive indicator enabled a systematic understanding of the disease-linked signaling events (2Wassarman D.A. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 3Luo H. Dearolf C.R.

We envisioned that clear morphological phenotypes of cells could similarly be used as a sensitive indicator of the drug effects that are not associated directly with the morphological phenotypes. The morphological alteration we used is the differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts into adipocytes, one of the most drastic and sensitive morphological alterations in cultured mammalian cells (7Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In the presence of insulin, 3T3-L1 cells undergo differentiation into adipocytes, which are visually distinct from the original cells because of the presence of oil droplets in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1). The insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells involves a number of disease-linked proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Ras, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, p38, or phosphodiesterases, and known drugs for a range of diseases have been reported to have phenotypic effects on the adipogenesis (7Rosen E.D.

A morphology-based adipogenesis screen of a chemical library could identify a pool of biologically active compounds with many distinct pharmacological effects. Here we report a proof-of-principle study using a library of 10,000 divergent compounds. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to reach maximal confluence. The confluent cells were treated individually with 20 ng/μl of a chemical for 3 days in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing of insulin (5 μg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).1 After the removal of insulin and the chemical, the cells were further maintained typically for 8 days with the replacement of media every 3 days. The effects of chemicals on the adipogenesis were evaluated under microscope. The control wells with 1% (v/v) Me2SO had ∼5% adipocytes. The compounds that enhanced the adipogenesis >5-folds were scored to be adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals, and the ones that completely inhibited adipogenesis without detectable toxicity were scored to be adipogenesis-blocking chemicals. The effects of these chemicals were confirmed multiple times by multiple laboratory members. Cell viability was monitored by trypan blue exclusion and by counting cell numbers. Total RNA was isolated with TRI-reagent (Molecular Research Center) at day 7 (aP2) or day 3 (osteocalcin). 5 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using oligo(dT) primer with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase for 60 min at 42 °C. The cDNA was then amplified by using ExTaq (Takara) with following primer pairs: 5′-AACACCGAGATTTCCTTCAA-3′ and 5′-TCACGCCTTTCATAACACAT-3′ for aP2; 5′-TCTGACAAACCTTCATGTCC-3′ and 5′-AAATAGTGATACCGTAGATGCG-3′ for osteocalcin. The amplification conditions are as follows: 95 °C (30 s), 60 °C (30 s), 72 °C (30 s) for 23 cycles (aP2) or 30 cycles (osteocalcin). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were induced to differentiate into adipocytes by incubation in a medium containing 10% FBS, 1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mmmethylisobutylxanthine, and 1.7 μm insulin. After 2 days, the medium was switched to the one containing 10% FBS and 1.7 μm insulin for 2 days and then to a normal 10% FBS medium for 3 days. After the total of 7 days, almost 100% 3T3-L1 cells were differentiated into adipocytes. These fully differentiated cells were treated on 24-well plates with varied concentrations of chemicals (0.1% Me2SO) for 24 h and then incubated with 100 nm insulin and 2-[3H]deoxyglucose. The cells were extensively washed, and their radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. All of the samples were tested in duplicate. For the analysis of IL-6 and TNF-α, the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was used. Cells were seeded onto 96-well plates, and the cytokine production was induced by adding 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide. Upon stimulation, each one of the adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals was also added to the culture at varied concentrations. After incubating for 48 h at 37 °C, the cytokine concentrations in the culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. For the analysis of IL-2, the mouse thymoma cell line EL-4 was used, and the IL-2 production was induced by adding phorbol ester and ionophore. The effects of chemicals on the IL-2 production were similarly examined by ELISA. All of the samples were tested in triplicate. The clonal osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1, clone 14, was grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS until confluent in 96-well plates. For induction of mineralization, the cells were further incubated with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate in the presence or absence of chemicals. On day 14, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 10% formalin, and washed with distilled water. Bonelike mineral formation was evaluated by examining the area stained by 2% (w/v) Alizarin Red S (pH 4.2). The adipogenesis-blocking chemicals were assayed for their ability to inhibit the growth of IGF-activated cancer cells. For the discovery of inhibitors of IGF2, we used five distinct human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, Hep-G2, SK-Hep-1, and three lines that we recently characterized. 2K. Murakami and M. Uesugi, unpublished data. Three of them produce IGF2 at high levels, whereas two express ∼10 times less amounts of IGF2 as measured by ELISA, RT-PCR, and DNA microarray experiments. Treatment with a neutralizing antibody against IGF2 selectively inhibited the growth of the IGF2-overexpressing cell lines but had little effects on that of the cell lines with low levels of IGF2. Thus, these cell lines served as an excellent system for discovering the chemicals that selectively impair the growth of IGF2-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma cells. For cell viability assays, IGF2-expressing cells were plated at a density of 4 × 103 onto 96-well plates. After a 24-h incubation, the cells were treated with varied amounts of chemicals for 72 h. The effects of chemicals were evaluated by microscopic observation and MTT assay. All of the samples were tested at least three times. For reporter gene assays, IGF2-expressing cells were transfected with a reporter construct in which a gene encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) is controlled by the IGF2 promoter, AP-1 sites, NFkB sites, or the SV40 promoter. After 24 h, the transfected cells were treated with 94G6 (0.1 μm) for 8 h. SEAP activity was measured through fluorescence change of methylumbelliferyl phosphate. The experiments were repeated six times. For the discovery of inhibitors of IGF1, we used DU-145, a human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell whose growth can be stimulated by IGF1 in a non-serum medium (13Iwamura M. Sluss P.M. Casamento J.B. Cockett A.T. Prostate. 1993; 22: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Chemicals that inhibit the IGF1-induced growth of DU-145 but not its serum-dependent growth were searched in the focused library of adipogenesis-blocking chemicals. DU-145 cells were seeded onto 96-well plates at a density of 2,000 cells/well in the presence of 1 μg/ml IGF1 or 2% FBS. After 24 h, chemicals were added to the culture at varied concentrations. Cell proliferation was estimated by MTT assays after 3 days. The experiments were performed in triplicate. The divergent chemical library used for our case study was a Prime Collection 2000 Format Q (ChemBridge). In this format, 10,000 druglike molecules are rationally preselected to form a library that covers the maximum pharmacore diversity with the minimum number of compounds. Two academic groups (14Komarov P.G. Komarova E.A. Kondratov R.V. Christov-Tselkov K. Coon J.S. Chernov M.V. Gudkov A.V. Science. 1999; 285: 1733-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 15Mayer T.U. Kapoor T.M. Haggarty S.J. King R.W. Schreiber S.L. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1999; 286: 971-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (1615) Google Scholar) have reported successful isolations of unique compounds from a similar chemical library, indicating that this type of chemical library contains a diverse set of compounds that are suited for a proof-of-principle study. Our cell morphology profiling of the 10,000-compound library identified 188 chemicals that clearly modulated the insulin-induced differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells at 20 ng/μl (Fig. 1): 81 compounds potentiated the adipogenesis; 87 compounds completely blocked the differentiation; and 13 compounds induced other morphological phenotypes such as adipocyte-like cells without oil droplets. Thus, the screen reduced a pool of chemicals by 53-fold. The adipogenesis-modulating activity of selected compounds was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of aP2, an adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (an example is shown in Fig. 1 E). The 188 adipogenesis-modulating chemicals that we found are apparently non-toxic for confluent 3T3-L1 cells and almost certainly modulate particular biologic responses in mammalian cells. The chemical structures of adipogenesis-enhancing and -blocking compounds are disclosed in supplementary Figs. 1 and 2. We first focused on the 81 chemicals that potentiated the insulin-induced adipogenesis. Their insulin-sensitizing activity in the adipocyte differentiation suggests that some of them enhance the insulin-induced glucose uptake with anti-diabetic properties. This prediction was supported by the fact that the thiazolidinedione family of anti-diabetic drugs enhances the adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells through the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, a nuclear receptor that plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation (16Lehmann J.M. Moore L.B. Smith-Oliver T.A. Wilkison W.O. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3461) Google Scholar). In fact, among the adipogenesis-enhancing compounds, nine had a structural element chemically equivalent to thiazolidinedione. These known chemicals were eliminated, and the remaining 72 chemicals were assayed for their ability to potentiate insulin-induced glucose uptake in cultured adipocytes. The 72 compounds contained as many as 11 molecules that enhanced the glucose uptake at comparable levels with that of pioglitazone, a clinically used anti-diabetic drug, demonstrating the validness of our approach. Four of them exhibited insulin-sensitizing activity stronger than pioglitazone at 10 μm, and the most potent one was 124D8 (Fig. 2). Its kinase-inhibitor-like structure is novel as an insulin sensitizer and appears to modulate the function of insulin independently from the major insulin pathways because 124D8 had no effects on the phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK in 3T3-L1 cells. Adipogenesis profiling of a larger chemical library is likely to generate a number of glucose-uptaking compounds with a novel mechanism of action. Recent studies (7Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 12Engelman J.A. Berg A.H. Lewis R.Y. Lin A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35630-35638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) suggest a cross-talk between insulin-induced adipogenesis and inflammatory responses. Anti-inflammatory drugs including glucocorticoid, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, and salicylates stimulate insulin-induced adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells, and molecular targets for anti-inflammatory drugs such as p38, TNF-α, and IL-1 are involved in adipogenesis or insulin resistance of somatic cells (11Engelman J.A. Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32111-32120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 17Ohsumi J. Sakakibara S. Yamaguchi J. Miyadai K. Yoshioka S.

Although the molecular mechanism of the cross-talk remains unclear, these lines of evidence implicate the presence of anti-inflammatory compounds in the pool of the adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals. We assayed the 72 adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals for their ability to reduce the production of three inflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-2, and TNF-α. Eighteen compounds inhibited the production of a cytokine >50% at 10 μm without notable cytotoxicity, suggesting a high density of cytokine production inhibitors in the adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals. Among those, the compound that we call 69A10 inhibited the TNF-α production in macrophage RAW cells with a IC50 of 0.3 μm (Fig.3). A focused library of adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals may be useful for identifying anti-TNF-α compounds, and their mechanistic studies would clarify the interesting cross-talk between adipogenesis and inflammatory responses. Insulin shares sequence homology and biological activity with IGFs. Deficiency in IGF1, a prominent member of IGFs, is suggested to be a cause of decrease in bone density with aging (20Rosen C.J. Donahue L.R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 219: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 21Baker J. Liu J.P. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 73-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2062) Google Scholar), and administration of IGF1 prevents the decrease of bone density in osteoporosis patients in part by stimulating osteogenesis (22Bianda T. Hussain M.A. Glatz Y. Bouillon R. Froesch E.R. Schmid C. J. Intern. Med. 1997; 241: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Ebeling P.R. Jones J.D. O'Fallon W.M. Janes C.H. Riggs B.L. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1993; 77: 1384-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 24Grinspoon S. Baum H. Lee K. Anderson E. Herzog D. Klibanski A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 81: 3864-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). The high homology between IGF1 and insulin suggested that the osteogenesis-enhancing activity of IGF1 may be mimicked by the chemicals that potentiated the insulin-induced adipogenesis. As a quick test, the adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals were assayed for their ability to stimulate the formation of bonelike mineral deposition in MC3T3-E1 cells. We found three compounds that increased the mineralization at 5 μm as much as IGF1 or ipriflavone, a clinically used anti-osteoporosis drug (Fig.4 A). Their osteogenesis-stimulating activity was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of osteocalcin, a marker gene of osteoblastic differentiation. The three compounds exhibited an increased induction of osteocalcin after 3 days of incubation (Fig. 4 B). These compounds may serve as a small molecule tool for the mechanistic analysis of osteogenesis, and such studies could lead to the development of pharmaceuticals for osteoporosis, one of the most underdiagnosed and undertreated disorders in medicine. We next turned our attention to the 87 compounds that blocked the insulin-induced adipogenesis. Both insulin and IGFs stimulate oncogenic signaling pathways including those of Ras-MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt, and overexpression of IGFs is often associated with cancer malignancy (25Yu H. Rohan T. J. Natl. Cancer. Inst. 2000; 92: 1472-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Patients with IGF-overexpressing tumors tend to have severe hypoglycemia despite low levels of serum insulin (known as non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia) (26Daughaday W.H. Diabetes Rev. 1995; 3: 62-72Google Scholar), demonstrating a functional overlap between oncogenic IGFs and insulin in vivo. These considerations led to the hypothesis that the pool of the adipogenesis-blocking chemicals contains anti-cancer compounds that suppress the IGF-stimulated survival and proliferation of malignant tumor cells. We first examined whether the adipogenesis-blocking chemicals impair the viability of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells that overexpress IGF2, a member of IGFs that is often produced at high levels in liver tumors (27Scharf J.G. Dombrowski F. Ramadori G. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 54: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We identified three chemically analogous compounds that killed IGF2-overexpressing hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep-G2) but had milder effects on the cell line with low levels of IGF2 (SK-Hep-1) (28Zvibel I. Halay E. Reid L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Repeated experiments with three additional human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines that we recently characterized2 indicated that one of the three chemicals, 94G6, exhibited the highest cytotoxicity to IGF2-producing hepatocellular carcinoma cells with selectivity similar to that of a neutralizing antibody against IGF2 (Fig.5 A). This benzochromene derivative killed the IGF2-producing cells at an IC50 of 29 nm but had ∼33 times weaker effects on the hepatocellular carcinoma cells with low level of IGF2. Reporter gene transcription assays showed that 94G6 selectively inhibits the promoter of IGF2 in the hepatocellular carcinoma cells, suggesting that 94G6 blocks the autocrine loop of IGF2 (Fig. 5 B). Although 94G6 may target multiple cellular events for causing cell death, the selective inhibition of the IGF2 autocrine loop provides a reasonable explanation for its inhibitory effects on adipogenesis and cancer cell survival. Another type of IGF-associated tumors is prostate cancer, one of the most common malignant tumors in Western countries. Elevated levels of circulating IGF1 are strongly associated with the risk of developing prostate cancer, and modulation of IGF1 functions by small molecules is an attractive therapeutic approach when combined with androgen-targeting therapies (29Djavan B. Waldert M. Seitz C. Marberger M. World J. Urol. 2001; 19: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). For a chemical screen, we used DU-145 androgen-independent prostate cancer cells whose growth can be stimulated by IGF1 by as much as 2% serum. The pool of the adipogenesis-blocking chemicals contained two analogous chemicals that specifically inhibited the IGF1-induced growth of DU-145 cells but had little effects on their serum-induced growth. One of them, 125B11, had the greatest differential activity in which the simple druglike thiazole derivative impaired the IGF1-induced growth at an IC50 of 0.1 μm but had little effects on the serum-dependent growth (Fig. 5 C). IGF1-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK in DU-145 cells was unaffected by 125B11, suggesting that 125B11 inhibits the cell-proliferative function of IGF1 in a way independent of the known IGF1-signaling pathway. Deregulation of the IGF axis is associated with the initiation and progression of many types of human carcinoma including breast (30Sachdev D. Yee D. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and colorectal cancers (31Hassan A.B. Macaulay V.M. Ann. Oncol. 2002; 13: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A focused library of adipogenesis-blocking chemicals may serve as a source of anti-proliferative agents against the IGF-linked cancers. Fat cell differentiation per se has no direct link to glucose uptake, cytokine inhibition, osteogenesis, and selective suppression of cancer cells. Nevertheless, our proof-of-principle study using a 10,000-compound library successfully identified non-cytotoxic bioactive compounds for these seemingly disparate pharmacological effects, just as genetics has identified non-lethal disease-linked genes by examining the eye morphology of fruit flies. We randomly picked up 70 compounds that had no detectable phenotypes in the adipogenesis profiling and assayed for their ability to modulate glucose uptake, cytokine production, IGF-selective cytotoxicity, and osteogenesis. As expected, no significant hits were found in each assay, indicating that the adipogenesis profiling with 3T3-L1 cells is a good filter at least for these pharmacological effects. A data base search revealed that one of the adipogenesis-enhancing chemicals has been patented as an inhibitor of neuropeptide Y, a proposed attenuator of insulin and leptin that stimulates appetite (32.Deleted in proof.Google Scholar). Neuropeptide Y inhibitors are expected to treat feeding disorders and heart diseases (33Balasubramaniam A. Am. J. Surg. 2002; 183: 430-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Adipogenesis profiling may find use in discovering chemicals with such biological effects. The insulin family of hormones is involved in many other conditions as observed in the complications of hyperinsulinism. The insulin-linked pharmacological effects including wound healing and anti-apoptosis (34Dore S. Kar S. Quirion R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4772-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) may be expected in adipogenesis-modulating compounds. One potential drawback of our approach is that the bioactive molecules from the adipogenesis-based focused library may have side effects that are associated with adipogenesis. However, some degree of side effects are usually expected for any unoptimized molecules, and classical medicinal chemistry approaches have been taken for reducing the unwanted side effects. The high sensitivity of the morphological transformation of 3T3-L1 cells also suggests that the adipogenesis-modulating effects of chemicals may not necessarily be reproduced in human. For instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as aspirin and caffeine are known to enhance adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells but have no significant effects on fat accumulation in human. The adipogenesis profiling is perhaps a good filter for lead-like bioactive molecules that can be used for further biological, chemical genetic, and medicinal chemical studies. Adipogenesis-based profiling of more chemical compounds including clinically proven drugs would catalog the biological activities of small organic molecules and help to design a focused chemical library that is small enough to be screened with unique low throughput assays yet generates drug seeds for a broad range of disease conditions. Systematic chemical genetic studies on morphological changes of cells could provide small molecule tools for biological studies of human diseases as found in the role of developmental biology in the analysis of disease-linked genes.

Several toxin A-negative strains from C. difficile have recently been isolated from clinical cases and have been reported to produce toxin B variants eliciting an atypical cytopathic effect. Ultrastructural analysis indicated these toxins induce a rounding cytopathic effect and filopodia-like structures. Toxin B variants glucosylated R-Ras, and transfection with a constitutively active mutant of this GTPase protected cells against their cytopathic effect. Treatment of cells with toxin B variants induced detachment from the extracellular matrix and blockade of the epidermal growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated protein kinases, demonstrating a deleterious effect on the R-Ras-controlled avidity of integrins. Treatment with toxin B variants also induced a transient activation of RhoA probably because of inactivation of Rac1. Altogether, these data indicate that the cytopathic effect induced by toxin B variants is because of cell rounding and detachment mediated by R-Ras glucosylation, and the induction of filopodia-like structures is mediated by RhoA activation. Implications for the pathophysiology of C. difficile-induced diarrhea are discussed.

C. difficile toxin A C. difficile toxin B C. sordellii lethal toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor from E. coli large clostridial cytotoxin epidermal growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase rhotekin RhoA-binding domain GTPase-binding domain of p21 activated kinase 1 tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate cytopathic effect glutathione S-transferase phosphate-buffered saline polyvinylidene difluoride Clostridium difficile induces clinical entities like antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis via the production of two toxins, toxin A (TcdA)1 and toxin B (TcdB). TcdA is known as the enterotoxin, because when inoculated in animal models in purified state, it is able to reproduce the clinical manifestations induced by C. difficile (1Lyerly D.M. Saum K.E. MacDonald D.K. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 349-352Google Scholar). TcdB, on the other hand, is known as the cytotoxin because of its potent cytotoxic activity on cultivated cells. Although TcdA is also cytotoxic it is 1000 times less efficient than TcdB (2Chaves-Olarte E. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1734-1741Google Scholar, 3Ciesla W.P. Bobak D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16021-16026Google Scholar). TcdB is not able to induce clinical symptoms in animal models unless inoculated together with sublethal amounts of TcdA (1Lyerly D.M. Saum K.E. MacDonald D.K. Wilkins T.D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 47: 349-352Google Scholar). These two toxins belong to the large clostridial cytotoxin (LCT) family (∼300 kDa) and are glucosyltransferases that modify GTPases of the RhoA subfamily by transferring the glucose moiety from UDP-glucose to threonine 35 (37 in RhoA) (4Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Google Scholar, 5Just I. Wilm M. Selzer J. Rex G. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Mann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13932-13936Google Scholar). This amino acid is located in the so-called effector region, which transmits signals to downstream effector molecules. Thus, it is predictable that a modification in this domain will impair the signal transduction cascade controlled by the GTPase (6Aktories K. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 282-288Google Scholar). Members of the RhoA subfamily are well known key controllers of the actin cytoskeleton (7Hall S. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar), thus one of the main characteristics of cellular intoxication with LCTs is a collapse in this network structure. In addition to TcdB and TcdA from the prototype strain VPI-10463, toxin variants of C. difficile toxin B, TcdB-1470 and TcdB-8864, have been isolated from TcdA-negative strains (8Eichel-Streiber C.V. Meyer D. Habermann E. Sartingen S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 313-321Google Scholar, 9Torres J.F. J. Med. Microbiol. 1991; 38: 434-441Google Scholar). These variants have been reported to produce a somehow different cytopathic effect (CPE) than the classical neurite-like morphology induced in fibroblasts by TcdB-10463 (9Torres J.F. J. Med. Microbiol. 1991; 38: 434-441Google Scholar, 10Chaves-Olarte E. Low P. Freer E. Norlin T. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11046-11052Google Scholar). Their role in pathogenic processes is uncertain although the appearance of TcdA-negative C. difficilestrains producing gastrointestinal pathology (11al-Barrak A. Embil J. Dyck B. Olekson K. Nicoll D. Alfa M. Kabani A. Can. Comm. Dis. Rep. 1999; 25: 65-69Google Scholar, 12Limaye A. Turgeon D. Cookson B. Fritsche T. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 1696-1697Google Scholar) has been reported. More recently, the prevalence of toxin A-negative strains producing C. difficile-associated diarrhea in 334 patients in France was found to be 2.7% (13Barbut F. Lalande V. Burghoffer B. Thien F.V. Grimprel E. Petit J.C. J. Clin. Microbiol. 2002; 40: 2079-2083Google Scholar). In all these cases toxin B was reported to produce an atypical CPE. Thus, cytotoxins from these strains might be relevant virulence factors that take over functions generally accepted to depend on TcdA. Of those variant cytotoxins, TcdB-1470 was shown to be a functional hybrid possessing the receptor-binding and internalization domain of TcdB-10463 and the glucosyltransferase domain of Clostridium sordellii TcsL (10Chaves-Olarte E. Low P. Freer E. Norlin T. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11046-11052Google Scholar). Because of these characteristics, TcdB-1470 and TcdB-10463 are the prototypes of the two different groups of LCTs divided according to substrate specificities as follows: (i) TcdA-10463 and TcdB-10463 modify RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 as common substrates; and (ii) TcdB-1470 (from C. difficile strain 1470) and TcsL (from C. sordellii) modify Rac1, Ral, Rap, and R-Ras (5Just I.

R-Ras is a particularly interesting substrate, because it has a unique 30-amino acid sequence in its N terminus differentiating it from H-, K-, or N-ras oncogenes (16Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas activated H-Ras has been shown to suppress the activation of certain integrins (17Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 251-530Google Scholar) R-Ras has the opposite activity and promotes integrin-dependent adhesion (18Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar, 19Osada M. Tolkacheva T. Li W. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Saez R. Kimmelman A.C. Chan A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6333-6344Google Scholar). Thus, its inactivation could have dramatic consequences for cell morphology and adhesion. The modification of RhoA has been shown to be the event responsible for the collapse of the actin cytoskeleton induced by the group of RhoA-modifying toxins (4Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Google Scholar, 20Giry M. Popoff M.R. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Google Scholar). The molecular consequences of this modification in terms of RhoA interaction with downstream effectors and with RhoA controlling proteins has been partially elucidated (21Herrmann C. Ahmadian M.R. Hofmann F. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16134-16139Google Scholar, 22Genth H. Aktories K. Just I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29050-29056Google Scholar). However, the sequence of events leading to induction of the early recognized neurite-like CPE (23Thelestam M. Bronnegard M. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1980; 22: 16-29Google Scholar), which is produced also by other RhoA-modifying toxins (including C3 from Clostridium botulinum), is barely understood (24Thelestam M. Chaves-Olarte E. Moos M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Alouf J. Freer J. The Comprehensive Sourcebook of Bacterial Protein Toxins. Academic Press, London1999: 147-173Google Scholar). Presently, the relevant substrate for the induction of a CPE by toxins that do not modify RhoA is unknown. In this study we have explored the molecular events leading to the CPE by toxin B variants from toxin A-negative strains. We demonstrate (i) that glucosylation of R-Ras induces cell detachment and rounding of the cell body by inactivation of integrins, and (ii) an imbalance in the activation state of RhoA via the inactivation of Rac1. The biological relevance of the two different types of CPE is discussed in the context of the pathology produced by C. difficile. C. difficile toxins TcdB-10463, TcdB-1470, TcdB-8864, TcdA-10463, and C. sordellii toxin (TcsL) were kindly provided by Dr. Christoph von Eichel-Streiber (Johannes Gutenberg-Universitãt, Mainz, Germany).Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF) 1 was prepared as described previously (25Flatau G. Lemichez E. Fauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Google Scholar). Eucaryotic expression vectors containing myc-tagged small GTPase mutants were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hall (University College London, London, England) and Dr. Patrice Boquet, (INSERM, Nice, France). Lipofectin was from Invitrogen. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were from Sigma. Anti-phospho ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling, and anti-ERK antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnologies. The GST-R-Ras fusion protein construct was a generous gift from Adrienne Cox (University of North Carolina). The GST-tagged rhotekin RhoA-binding domain (RBD) was expressed from plasmid pGEX-2T-RBD (kindly provided by Dr. Martin Alexander Schwartz, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). The GST-tagged GTPase-binding domain of p21-activated kinase 1 (PBD) was expressed from a derivative pGEX-2T plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. Gary Bokoch, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). All plasmids were transformed into the E. coli BL-21 strain, and expression of fusion proteins was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The recombinant proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AmershamBiosciences). UDP-[14C]glucose (specific activity, 318 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from local commercial sources. 5 μl of UDP-[14C]glucose dissolved in ethanol were vacuum-dried, and 10 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm GDP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.8) containing recombinant GST-R-Ras (2 μg) were added. The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 μg/ml of TcdB-10463, TcdB-1470, or TcdB-8864 or 100 μg/ml of TcdA-10463. The reaction was stopped by heating at 95 °C in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled R-Ras was detected by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Mouse BalbC 3T3 fibroblasts (ATCC CCL-163) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 5 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). Human epithelial HeLa cells (ATCC CCL-2) were cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented as indicated above. Both cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transfection of cells with plasmids encoding myc-tagged V12Rac1, V38R-Ras, V12Rap1, or V14RhoA was performed with Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 50000 cells were seeded on 13-mm glass coverslips and cultivated for 24 h. Lipofectin was mixed with 1 μg of plasmid in Eagle's minimal essential medium without fetal bovine serum and antibiotics, and the complex was allowed to form for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was then laid onto subconfluent HeLa cells, and the cells were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. The original medium was changed to fully supplemented medium. Cells were intoxicated 48 h after this treatment at the conditions indicated in the figure legends. Cells cultivated on 13-mm glass coverslips and transfected as described above were intoxicated with clostridial toxins as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were further incubated with anti-Myc 9E10 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min, followed by secondary TRITC anti-mouse antibody for an additional 30 min. For staining of the actin cytoskeleton, cells were incubated for 30 min with 0.5 μg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Sigma). Fluorescence and phase contrast were visualized using an Olympus BH-2 microscope, and images were captured using a digital camera (MagnaFire). The percentage of cells protected from clostridial toxins was calculated as the fraction of cells showing no CPE as viewed by phase contrast among 300 cells positive for GTPase expression as determined by immunofluorescence using a monoclonal anti-Myc antibody. Subconfluent cells grown in 13-mm glass slides, intoxicated as indicated in the figure legends, were chemically immobilized with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 4 °C for 2 h and post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide in phosphate buffer for 30 min. Fixed cells were dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol and frozen in tert-butyl alcohol. Cells were freeze-dried by sublimation and coated with 20 nm of gold-palladium (10 mAmp, 2 min). Cells were observed and photographed with an S-570 (Hitachi) scanning electron microscope operating at 15 kV. BalbC 3T3 cells growing in 24-well plates were serum-starved overnight and treated with clostridial toxins or left untreated as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min, washed twice with ice cold PBS, and lysed in Laemmli sample buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad DC method according to the manufacturer's instructions, and equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were loaded onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and probed with anti-phospho-ERK or anti-ERK antibodies. Membranes were further incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibodies, and the detected bands were visualized with a chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Pierce Super Signal WestDura). Cells cultivated on 24-well plates to 90% confluence were intoxicated or left untreated as indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed three times with PBS, the remaining cells were lysed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the protein concentration was quantified using bovine serum albumin as standard. For precipitation steps, GTP-RhoA was quantified with GST-tagged RBD (26Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar), and GTP-Rac1 and GTP-Cdc42 were quantified with GST-PBD (27Benard V. Bokoch G.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 345: 349-359Google Scholar). HeLa cells cultured in 6-well plates were intoxicated at the conditions indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 μl of ice-cold precipitation buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.3% Nonidet P-40, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 1 min. Twenty μl of each lysate were saved as control for total GTPase content. GTP-loaded RhoA GTPases were precipitated with Sepharose beads coupled to either GST-PBD or GST-RBD protein. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with shaking, washed with precipitation buffer, and resuspended in 25 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples transferred to a PVDF membrane were probed with either rabbit antibodies against RhoA or Cdc42 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or with anti-Rac1 monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Probing and developing were performed with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies and the chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Pierce Super Signal WestDura), respectively. GTP-Cdc42, GTP-RhoA, and GTP-Rac1 levels were calculated using the Scion Image software for Windows and compared with control total levels of Cdc42, RhoA, and Rac1. The CPE induced by TcdA-10463, TcdB-10463, TcdB-1470, and TcdB-8864 was studied in 3T3 fibroblasts and epithelial HeLa cells by scanning electron microscopy. After intoxication with TcdA-10463 or TcdB-10463, 3T3 fibroblasts showed a neurite-like CPE characterized by the presence of long protrusions attached to the substratum (Fig.1). HeLa cells treated with the same toxins developed a more rounded phenotype with few protrusions (Fig.1); these protrusions are barely seen under light microscopy (data not shown). After intoxication with TcdB-1470 or TcdB-8864, 3T3 fibroblasts presented a rounded phenotype. The cells appeared to be detaching from the substratum, and some presented blebs on their surface. A rounded CPE was also evident in HeLa cells, and filopodia-like structures emanating from the cell body were observed (Fig. 1). RhoA glucosylation is essential for the CPE induced by TcdB-10463 (4Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Google Scholar, 20Giry M. Popoff M.R. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Boquet P. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4063-4071Google Scholar); however, the relevant in vivo substrate for LCTs not affecting RhoA is not known. We tested the ability of TcdA-10463 and TcdB-8864 to glucosylate recombinant R-Ras in vitro. Because of its low enzymatic activity (2Chaves-Olarte E. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1734-1741Google Scholar, 3Ciesla W.P. Bobak D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16021-16026Google Scholar) TcdA-10463 was used 100 times more concentrated than the negative control TcdB-10463. Under these conditions we did not detect any radioactive signal from R-Ras after TcdA-10463 treatment but detected a radioactive band after TcdB-8864 treatment, similar to the positive control, TcdB-1470 (Fig.2 A). This indicates that R-Ras is a substrate also for this toxin B variant. Thus, among LCTs there exists a strict correlation between RhoA glucosylation and induction of a neurite-like CPE and between R-Ras glucosylation and induction of a rounding CPE, suggesting R-Ras to be a crucial in vivosubstrate for the latter group of LCTs. To test this hypothesis HeLa cells transiently transfected with constitutively active V38R-Ras were intoxicated with TcdB-1470. At conditions inducing 100% CPE by TcdB-1470 in control non-transfected cells, V38R-Ras-transfected cells showed no sign of CPE (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, V38R-Ras expression did not protect cells against TcdB-10463-induced CPE (Fig.2 B). The degree of protection obtained by transfection of activated GTPases was quantified. Almost no cells expressing V38R-Ras showed a detectable CPE after TcdB-1470 treatment whereas V12Rac1 and V12Rap1 expression conferred a lower degree of protection (Fig.2 C). Only ∼10% of cells expressing V14RhoA (negative control) were protected against the TcdB-1470-induced CPE. Similar results were obtained with 3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). Altogether these results indicate that R-Ras is a major in vivosubstrate determining the CPE of one group of LCTs.Figure 2Relevance of R-Ras as substrate for TcdB-1470. A, purified recombinant R-Ras (2 μg) in GST fusion form was incubated with TcdB-10463 (5 μg/ml), TcdA-10463 (100 μg/ml), TcdB-8864 (5 μg/ml), or TcdB-1470 (5 μg/ml) in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose (30 μm). After 1 h of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and labeled bands were detected by PhosphorImager analysis. The Coomassie-stained gel and PhosphorImager analysis of the same gel are shown. B, HeLa cells transfected withmyc-tagged constitutively active V38R-Ras were intoxicated with TcdB-1470 (A and B) or TcdB-10463 (C and D) for 2 h. R-Ras expressing cells were visualized by immunofluorescence using anti-Myc antibodies (B and D); the same fields were observed by phase-contrast microscopy (A and C).C, HeLa cells transfected with constitutively activemyc-tagged V12Rac1, V12Rap1, V38R-Ras, or V14RhoA were intoxicated with TcdB-1470 for 2 h. The percentage of 300 successfully transfected cells (visualized as in B) protected from CPE is shown. Mean of triplicate transfections and S.D. from one representative experiment of three is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells treated with the R-Ras-modifying toxins TcdB-1470 or TcdB-8864 rounded up in less than 1 h and seemed loosely attached to the substratum, whereas TcdB-10463-treated cells still remained attached 24 h after intoxication (data not shown). These observations, together with the reported role of R-Ras in controlling the activation state of integrins (18Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.G. Reed J.G. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Google Scholar), prompted us to investigate whether TcdB-1470 treatment induces cell detachment. 3T3 fibroblasts were intoxicated for 1 h with the different toxins, and after several washing steps, the remaining cells were quantified. TcdB-10463-treated cells remained attached to the substratum to the same extent as control non-intoxicated cells whereas TcdB-1470 induced a massive detachment of cells (Fig. 3 A). The same result was obtained with TcdB-8864 and with HeLa epithelial cells (data not shown). Integrin engagement has been proven to be essential for EGF-mediated activation of ERK kinases (28Renshaw M.W. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5592-5599Google Scholar); thus we tested whether TcdB-1470 treated cells were able to support this signaling pathway. Serum-starved cells intoxicated for 4 h with TcdB-10463, TcdB-1470, or TcdB-8864 were treated with EGF, and the tyrosine phosphorylation status of ERK kinases was investigated. ERK kinases were phosphorylated in cells intoxicated with TcdB-10463 to the same extent as in non-treated control cells upon stimulation with EGF. On the other hand, the EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK kinases in TcdB-1470- or TcdB-8864-treated cells was significantly impaired when compared with the control cells (Fig. 3 B). This result indicates that TcdB-10463-intoxicated cells have a biologically relevant adhesive phenotype whereas focal contacts are affected by intoxication with TcdB-1470 or TcdB-8864. TcdB-8864 and TcdB-1470 (Fig. 1) induce filopodia-like structures in HeLa cells. These structures appear before the cells are rounded (∼30 min), peak at 60 min, and then disappear after 3 h of intoxication. C. sordellii TcsL induces a similar phenomenon (14Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. Eichel-Streiber C.V. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Google Scholar). We used the RhoA GTPase activator CNF1 fromE. coli to assess the role of these GTPases in the induction of filopodia after TcdB-1470 intoxication. When HeLa cells were pre-treated with CNF1 for 2 h and further incubated with TcdB-1470, a strong promotion in both the number and length of filopodia was observed (Fig. 4). This result suggested an active involvement of some member(s) of the RhoA GTPase subfamily in the filopodia formation after toxin treatment. Thus, we monitored the activation state of individual RhoA GTPases after intoxication with TcdB-1470 and TcdB-10463 by pull-down assays (26Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Google Scholar, 29Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collart J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Google Scholar). A decrease in the level of Rac1-GTP by TcdB-1470 was evident as early as 30 min post-incubation (Fig.5 A). This decrease was followed at 60 min by disappearance of Rac1 from total cell lysates. Although this finding might suggest proteolytic degradation of Rac1 after glucosylation, this interpretation is not likely to be correct, because the anti-Rac1 antibody used in this study has been shown recently not to recognize glucosylated Rac1. 2I. Just, personal communication. The same anti-Rac1 antibody recognized two isoforms of this protein whereas the PBD-Sepharose beads preferentially pulled down only one isoform (Fig.5 A). The level of RhoA-GTP exhibited a significant and consistent increase at 60 min post-intoxication (Fig. 5 B),i.e. at the time when filopodia formation by TcdB-1470 was maximal (Fig. 4). After 120 min of incubation, RhoA-GTP returned to initial levels (Fig. 5 B). The level of Cdc42-GTP remained essentially unaltered throughout intoxication (Fig. 5 C). These results are consistent with the reported in vitrosubstrates for TcdB-1470 (10Chaves-Olarte E. Low P. Freer E. Norlin T. Weidmann M. Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11046-11052Google Scholar). When the same set of experiments was repeated with TcdB-10463, a decrease in Rac1-GTP, RhoA-GTP, and Cdc42-GTP levels was evident (Fig. 6). The inactivation kinetics of all three proteins followed a similar pattern with a significant decrease detected at 30 min. GTP-bound proteins reached undetectable levels at 60 min post-incubation. The Rac1 signal disappeared from total lysates 60 min after TcdB-10463 addition, mirroring the TcdB-1470-induced effect on this protein (Fig.6 A).Figure 5Effect of TcdB-1470 on the activation state of RhoA GTPases. Confluent monolayers of HeLa cells in 6-well plates were intoxicated with TcdB-1470 for the indicated times. After treatment, cells were lysed, and 20 μl were separated as control for total amount of GTPases. Lysates were then incubated with RBD-GST (B, upper panel) or PBD-GST (A andC, upper panel)-Sepharose beads for 30 min.

However, we have observed that populations of hTERT-immortalized human fibroblasts contain 3–20% cells with a senescent morphology. To determine what causes the appearance of these senescent-like cells, we used flow cytometry to select them from the population and analyzed them for various senescence markers, telomere length, and telomerase activity. This subpopulation of cells had elevated levels of p21 and hypophosphorylated Rb, but telomere length was similar to that of the immortal cells in the culture that was sorted. Surprisingly, telomerase activity in the senescent-like cells was significantly elevated compared with immortal cells from the same population, suggesting that high telomerase activity may induce the senescent phenotype. Furthermore, transfection of normal fibroblasts with a hTERT-expressing plasmid that confers high telomerase activity led to the induction of p21, a higher percentage of SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells, and a greater number of cells entering growth arrest compared with controls. These results suggest that excessive telomerase activity may act as a hyperproliferative signal in cells and induce a senescent phenotype in a manner similar to that seen following overexpression of oncogenic Ras, Raf, and E2F1. Thus, there must be a critical threshold of telomerase activity that permits cell proliferation.

Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5589) Google Scholar). Replicative senescence is thought to provide a barrier against the unlimited proliferation and formation of cancer. The best described counting mechanism for replicative senescence involves the telomere-shortening hypothesis. Telomerase is not expressed in most human tissues; therefore, telomeres shorten with every cell division. When telomeres reach a critical length, irreversible growth arrest is activated. It has been demonstrated that ectopic expression of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT)1 can immortalize fibroblasts (2Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B.

Whether reconstitution of telomerase activity alone is sufficient for immortalization of cell types other than fibroblasts has been a subject of debate. Kiyono et al. (5Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) have shown that inactivation of Rb/p16INK4A is required in addition to telomerase for immortalization of epithelial cells. O'Hare et al. (6O'Hare M.J. Bond J. Clarke C. Takeuchi Y. Atherton A.J. Berry C. Moody J. Silver A.R. Davies D.C. Alsop A.E. Neville A.M. Jat P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 646-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) have found that telomerase was not sufficient to immortalize adult mammary fibroblasts and endothelial cells. However, subsequently, Ramirez et al. (7Ramirez R.D. Morales C.P. Herbert B.S. Rohde J.M. Passons C. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) demonstrated that telomerase activity alone could immortalize epithelial cells if they were grown on feeder layers, and they proposed that the results of the earlier report (5Kiyono T. Foster S.A. Koop J.I. McDougall J.K. Galloway D.A. Klingelhutz A.J. Nature. 1998; 396: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) were because of inadequate growth conditions (7Ramirez R.D. Morales C.P. Herbert B.S. Rohde J.M. Passons C. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Although immortalization of normal human fibroblasts by ectopic expression of hTERT has been convincingly demonstrated, it is becoming apparent that immortality is not the universal outcome of hTERT expression. It has been observed that cultures of hTERT-transduced fibroblasts may undergo a crisis-like stage or acquire a senescent phenotype (8Franco S. MacKenzie K.L. Dias S. Alvarez S. Rafii S. Moore M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 9MacKenzie K.L. Franco S. May C. Sadelain M. Moore M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 336-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was found that senescence was not related to the loss of telomerase activity, because there was no correlation between telomere length and immortalization, and among the clones that entered growth arrest, some had long and others short telomeres. The mechanism(s) that induces senescence, despite the presence of telomerase activity, remains unclear. One possibility is that in some cells senescence is triggered by the activation of a stress response pathway. Another explanation for the apparent lack of immortalization in some fibroblasts is that immortalization is achieved only at a certain level of telomerase activity, which may not be always reproduced by ectopic expression of hTERT. We have observed that in three different lines of human fibroblasts, 3–20% of the cells in the population immortalized by expression of hTERT and grown for >70 PDs had a senescent-like morphology. In this study, we aimed to examine the mechanism(s), that caused the senescent-like growth arrest in telomerase-expressing cells. To this end, we developed a flow cytometry-based method to isolate these cells from the population of actively growing immortalized cells. We then compared them to the actively growing cells from the same population. The isolated cells had features typical of senescent cells. Unexpectedly, we found that telomerase activity in the senescent-like cells was significantly elevated compared with immortal cells from the same population. Furthermore, the overexpression of hTERT from a CMV promoter from a plasmid induced a senescent-like phenotype in a number of the newly transfected young cells. These results suggest that excessive telomerase activity may induce the senescent-like phenotype. We discuss the potential mechanism of telomerase-induced senescence and its similarities to premature senescence induced by oncogenes or proliferative signals. IMR-90 and LF1 are normal human lung fibroblasts. WI-38 fibroblasts and IMR-90 cells were from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, and LF1 fibroblasts were a kind gift from J. Sedivy (10Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). HCA2 human foreskin fibroblasts were isolated in our laboratory. IMR-90-hTERT and HCA2-hTERT were kindly provided by J. Campisi. LF1-hTERT was kindly provided by J. Sedivy (11Wei S. Wei S. Sedivy J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1539-1543PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wei W.

Cells were grown in Hank's minimal essential medium or Earle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. In a typical experiment, 107-108 cells were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in 2 ml of fresh EMEM medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, placed on ice, and immediately used for sorting. Cells were sorted by a Beckman-Coulter EPICS Altra using Expo 32 MultiComp software (Applied Cytometry Systems). The sorting parameters for selection of “large-senescent” and “small-young” cells were determined for each cell line using the corresponding young and senescent cultures without hTERT as standards (Fig. 1). The following two areas were selected: area Acontained the majority of young cells (>70%); and area Bcovered the large-senescent cells and contained <1% of the dividing cells. Small and large cells were sorted simultaneously using two-way casting. Following sorting, cells were aliquoted and frozen for subsequent experiments, and a small aliquot (105 cells) was plated into a 35-mm tissue culture dish for SA-β-galactosidase staining. Cells were fixed and stained for SA-β-galactosidase as described previously (13Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O.

The percent of SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells was calculated by counting at least 500 cells/sample. Cells were hybridized in situ with a fluorescent telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid probe as described previously (14Hultdin M. Gronlund E. Norrback K.F. Eriksson-Lindstrom E. Just T. Roos G.

Frozen cells (105) were thawed, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended to 105 cells/100 μl of a hybridization mixture containing 70% dimethylformamide, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3 μg/μl telomere-specific (CCCTAA)3 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated peptide nucleic acid probe (Applied Biosystems). After 10 min at 82 °C, samples were incubated overnight at room temperature in the dark. Following hybridization, cells were spun down, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline at 40 °C for 10 min, and finally resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1 μg/ml propidium iodide. After 4 h at room temperature in the dark, cells were analyzed by FACS on Beckman-Coulter EPICS XL-MCL using System II version 3.0 software. Events were gated according to propidium iodide fluorescence to restrict the analysis to cells with diploid DNA content. Adherent fibroblasts were harvested and lysed in protein sample buffer and boiled for 10 min, and equal numbers of cells were loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were hybridized with the following antibodies: anti-p21(WAF1(Ab1) (Oncogene) and anti-Rb (Rb Ab1(1F8) (LabVision). Equivalent loading of lanes was verified by hybridization with anti-actin antibodies (Calbiochem). Cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1- hTERT or pcDNA3.1 plasmids plated at a density of 200 cells/100-mm dish, and they were incubated undisturbed in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Dishes were then fixed and stained with 1% crystal violet. The number of cells in individual colonies was determined by microscopy. The introduction of telomerase activity into normal human fibroblasts allows them to escape replicative senescence (2Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B.

Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). However, we have observed that immortal cultures of human fibroblasts contain some cells with a senescent morphology. In order to examine whether this was associated with other senescent cell markers and related to changes in telomere length or telomerase activity, we analyzed three lines of human fibroblasts that have been frequently used to study senescence: fetal lung fibroblasts IMR-90 and LF1 and foreskin fibroblasts HCA2. The fibroblasts were immortalized by infection with a retroviral vector containing an hTERT expression cassette. IMR-90+hTERT and HCA2+hTERT cells were propagated as mass cultures following infection, whereas LF1+hTERT was a clonal isolate. Cells were grown for at least 70 PDs after infection to confirm the immortalized phenotype. Although the cultures were actively proliferating, we observed some enlarged flat cells with a senescent morphology in the population. To quantify the percentage of senescent cells, we used SA-β-galactosidase staining and determined that the immortal cultures contained 3–20% SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells (TableI).Table IPercent of SA-β-galactosidase-positive cellsTotal populationSorted cellsLargeSmallHCA2+hTERT3 ± 1.563 ± 5.60IMR-90+hTERT6 ± 260 ± 7.30LF1+hTERT20 ± 2.695 ± 4.20 Open table in a new tab The biochemical analysis of the senescent cells that arise within populations of proliferating cells has been limited by the inability to isolate a sufficient number of living senescent cells from the growing mass culture. To overcome this limitation, we developed a method to purify senescent cells by flow cytometry using a FACS cell sorter. Senescent cells are characterized by increased cell volume; therefore, we have sorted cells according to size (Fig.1). To allow for subsequent biochemical analysis and to avoid fluctuations in cell volume that might result from the use of fixatives, we sorted live unfixed cells. To determine the cut-off parameters for selection of large-senescent and small-young cells for each cell line, we first analyzed the size distribution of young (PD 18–24) and senescent (PD 55–75) cultures of normal IMR-90, HCA2, and LF1 fibroblasts that were not expressing hTERT. Two areas were selected: area A contained the majority of young cells (>70%); and area B contained the large-senescent cells with <1% of young cells (Fig. 1). We observed that in normal senescent cultures, a larger percentage of cells was in area B when compared with young cultures. In addition, the percent of SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells corresponded to the percent of large cells in the population. Following sorting, aliquots of cells were plated and stained for SA-β-galactosidase activity (Table I) (Fig.2). The large cells contained 60–95% SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells and had a typical senescent morphology, whereas the small cells were SA-β-galactosidase-negative and had a young morphology indicating that the sorting procedure that we used was capable of selectively isolating senescent cells. To test whether isolated cells had other senescent features, we analyzed the level of p21 and Rb status in the sorted cells. Large-senescent cells had elevated levels of p21 and hypophosphorylated Rb compared with the small-young cells from the same culture (Fig.3), similar to what has been observed in normal replicative senescent cells. To determine whether telomere shortening or excessive telomere elongation was responsible for the appearance of the senescent-like cells, we compared telomere length in these cells with proliferating cells isolated from the same hTERT-immortalized culture. The initial assessment of telomere length using terminal restriction fragment polymorphism and Southern blotting did not show any significant differences in telomere length between old and young cells (data not shown). However, because it was difficult to obtain a sufficient number of sorted cells for the accurate comparison of telomere length by Southern analysis, we used a flow-fluorescentin situ hybridization technique to compare the telomere lengths. This technique quantifies by flow cytometry the average fluorescent signals from individual cells after hybridization with a fluorescent probe specific for telomere repeats. Following sorting, cells were fixed, hybridized with the fluorescent probe, and stained with propidium iodide. Telomere fluorescence was measured only in G1 cells. The telomere length in the large senescent-like cells was not different from that in proliferating cells from the same population (Fig. 4), indicating that telomere shortening is not responsible for the induction of the senescent-like growth arrest in this case. A simple explanation for the appearance of the subpopulation of senescent-like cells in the hTERT-immortalized cultures was the loss of telomerase activity due to silencing of the transgene or by some other mechanism. Our system for isolation of these cells allowed us to directly test this possibility as we could compare telomerase activity in the senescent-like and immortal cells from the same population. Telomerase activity in the sorted cells was analyzed using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Protein extracts were prepared from the samples of sorted cells, and telomerase activity was determined in the samples containing equal amounts of protein. To allow an accurate comparison, the assay was performed on serial dilutions of cell extract (1,000, 100, and 10 ng of protein, respectively). The telomerase activity in senescent-like LF1+hTERT, HCA2+hTERT, and IMR-90+hTERT cells was 10-, 5-, and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, than in the immortal “young” controls from the same cultures (Fig. 5). Since senescent cells have 2–3 times larger volume (our observation) and twice more protein (18Kulju K.S. Lehman J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) than young cells, the telomerase activity in the old cells could be underestimated. Because the hTERT cDNA was expressed from a constitutive LTR promoter, it was unlikely that this promoter was up-regulated as a result of cells becoming senescent. However, to rule out this possibility, we introduced a construct with green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of an LTR promoter into mid-passage IMR-90 cells and passaged these cells to senescence. We did not observe any increase in GFP expression or activity in senescent cells compared with young cells. On the contrary, GFP activity was down-regulated as cells were passaged to senescence (data not shown). Therefore, our results suggest that high telomerase activity was what induced loss of proliferation in these cells. To test directly whether excessive telomerase activity can induce a senescent-like phenotype, we transfected young HCA2 fibroblasts with a hTERT expression vector and examined the newly transfected cells. hTERT cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−) vector (Promega) under the control of CMV promoter to enable strong expression. The resulting plasmid pcDNA3.1-hTERT or pcDNA3.1 vector as control was transfected into HCA2 normal human fibroblasts at PD 21. Transfection was done with either FuGENE 6 reagent or Amaxa electroporator using the maximum allowed DNA concentration in order to introduce a high number of plasmid copies per cell. Telomerase activity was analyzed by TRAP assay 3 days after transfection and compared with telomerase activity in hTERT-immortalized HCA2 cells. Telomerase activity in the newly transfected cells was significantly stronger than in the immortalized cell line (Fig. 6 A). We then allowed the cells to divide for 10 days and compared the number of senescent cells in the pcDNA3.1-hTERT and control transfections using SA-β-galactosidase staining. pcDNA3.1-hTERT- transfected cell population contained 10 times more SA-β-galactosidase-positive cells than the control cells transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector (Fig. 6 B). Western blot analysis also showed the induction of p21 in the pcDNA3.1-hTERT- transfected cells compared with control cells (Fig. 6 C). We also examined the division potential of pcDNA3.1-hTERT-transfected cells by colony size distribution. pcDNA3.1-hTERT-transfected cells formed smaller clones than the control cells, and the majority of the clones stopped proliferation after 1–4 divisions (Fig. 6 D). These results demonstrate that excessive telomerase activity can induce a senescent-like phenotype in normal human fibroblasts. Many years ago, Martinez et al. (19Martinez A.O. Norwood T.H. Prothero J.W. Martin G.M. In Vitro. 1978; 14: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and Pereira-Smith and Smith (20Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Somatic Cell Genet. 1981; 7: 411-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) described the fact that in cultures of tumor-derived and SV40-transformed immortal human cells, there was a subpopulation of cells with very limited division potential. These studies involved a clonal analysis of the proliferative capacity of the cells. The percentage of these cells varied from 1 to 30% depending on the cell line studied, and we have observed this in many other immortalized cell lines. 2O. M. Pereira-Smith, unpublished observations. The plausible explanation at the time was that this was a consequence of the genomic instability of the cells, causing some cells to drop out of the cell cycle. However, in this study, we have analyzed the similar phenomenon in hTERT-immortalized cells that are karyotypically normal. To examine the factors that trigger senescence in immortalized cell populations, we have developed a method to purify living senescent cells from the populations of human fibroblasts immortalized by hTERT. This allowed us to perform analysis of telomeres and telomerase activity in these cells. We have found that telomere length in the senescent cells was not different from the immortal cells of the same culture. This result corroborates an earlier observation (7Ramirez R.D. Morales C.P. Herbert B.S. Rohde J.M. Passons C. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar) that did not find a direct correlation between telomere length and immortalization status. The majority of fibroblast cultures expressing hTERT have longer than “physiological” telomeres; however, such long telomeres have not been associated with growth arrest or apoptosis (8Franco S. MacKenzie K.L. Dias S. Alvarez S. Rafii S. Moore M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 268: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 21Vaziri H. Squire J.A. Pandita T.K. Bradley G. Kuba R.M. Zhang H. Gulyas S. Hill R.P. Nolan G.P. Benchimol S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2373-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that telomerase activity was significantly elevated in senescent cells compared with immortal proliferating cells from the same culture. Similar results were obtained with three different cell lines of immortalized human fibroblasts. hTERT cDNA was expressed from a constitutive LTR promoter, which is not known to be up-regulated in senescent cells. We also did not observe any activation of the LTR promoter in senescent cells in our control experiments with an LTR-GFP construct. When high levels of telomerase activity were induced in the young cells by overexpression of hTERT from a plasmid under a CMV promoter, some of the newly transfected cells acquired senescent-like phenotype and entered growth arrest. Therefore, these results suggest that excessive telomerase activity may induce the senescent-like phenotype. The idea that high telomerase activity may induce senescence seems reasonable if telomerase is viewed as a proliferative signal. A growing body of data suggests that hyperproliferative signals may induce a senescent-like state in normal human cells. Thus, a loss of proliferative potential is induced by the expression of activated RAS (22Serrano M. Lin A.W. McCurrach M.E. Beach D. Lowe S.W. Cell. 1997; 88: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3994) Google Scholar) or RAF (23Zhu J. Woods D. McMahon M. Bishop J.M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2997-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) or overexpression of E2F1 (24Dimri G.P. Itahana K. Acosta M. Campisi J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 273-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This type of premature senescence is thought to be a fail-safe mechanism that prevents normal cells that experience potentially oncogenic insults from proliferating. Telomerase activity is reconstituted by overexpression of hTERT from a strong promoter, which provides much higher levels of expression than is normally achieved from the endogenous hTERT promoter. In normal tissues, telomerase activity is tightly regulated and the hTERT promoter is turned on in specific cell types only for limited time periods, for example, during clonal expansion of lymphocytes (25Weng N.P. Levine B.L. June C.H. Hodes R.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2471-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) or in endometrial cells during the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle (26Brien T.P. Kallakury B.V. Lowry C.V. Ambros R.A. Muraca P.J. Malfetano J.H. Ross J.S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2760-2764PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kyo S. Takakura M. Kohama T. Masaki I. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 610-614PubMed Google Scholar, 28Kyo S.

Reprod. 1998; 4: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that there are some feedback mechanisms to down-regulate the hTERT promoter when telomerase activity is no longer needed. When hTERT is expressed ectopically from a constitutive viral promoter, the cell is unable to down-regulate its expression and may respond by arresting growth. The level of hTERT expression is not the only determinant of the level of telomerase activity, because it is also regulated by phosphorylation (30Kharbanda S. Kumar V. Dhar S. Pandey P. Chen C.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 4826-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Furthermore, telomerase is not a classical oncogene, and hTERT-immortalized cells do not display the characteristics of cancer cells (33Morales C.P. Holt I. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). This may explain why telomerase-induced senescence is not as robust a process as oncogene-induced senescence and is only induced in a fraction of cells in which the telomerase activity becomes too high. In summary, we present the first evidence that high telomerase activity could induce a senescent-like phenotype. Understanding the mechanisms of this process will be of great importance in developing applications of hTERT in cell therapy and tissue engineering. We thank J. Campisi for providing HCA2-hTERT and IMR-90-hTERT cells and J. Sedivy for LF1 and LF1-hTERT cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050518514,"Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is a potent factor modulating the activity of many cell types. Its dimerization and binding to high affinity receptors are considered to be necessary steps to induce FGF receptor phosphorylation and signaling activation. A structural analysis was carried out and a region encompassing residues 48–58 of human FGF-2 was identified, as potentially involved in FGF-2 dimerization. A peptide (FREG-48–58) derived from this region strongly and specifically inhibited FGF-2 induced proliferation and migration of primary bovine aorta endothelial cells (BAEC) in vitro, and markedly reduced FGF-2-dependent angiogenesis in two distinct in vivo assays. To further investigate the role of region 48–58, a polyclonal antibody raised against FREG-(48–58) was tested and was found to block FGF-2 action in vitro. Human FGF-2 has three histidine residues, one falling within the region 48–58. Chemical modification of histidine residues blocked FGF-2 activity and FREG-(48–58) inhibitory effect in vitro, indicating that histidine residues, in particular the one within FREG-(48–58) region, play a crucial role in the observed activity.

In light of the key role FGF-2 plays in both physiologic and pathologic conditions, structural-functional relationships studies on this factor are of large interest. FGF-2 dimerization and its interaction with heparan sulfates are necessary steps required for binding to high affinity receptors and for the following signaling activation. Several reports investigated functionally relevant regions of FGF-2 by analyzing crystallographic structures or by mutagenesis studies. FGF-2 dimer has not been crystallized, and different studies based on molecular simulations indicated different regions possibly lying at the FGF-2 dimer interface (15Safran M. Eisenstein M.

In this study low-resolution docking parameters for globular proteins were used according to the GRAMM software manual. Regions at the interface of the predicted FGF-2 dimer were identified by solvent accessibility analysis as described above. According to these analyses, the FGF-2 region including the sequence DPHIKLQLQAE (here referred to as FREG-(48–58)) was identified. FREG-(48–58) was then custom synthesized by Research Genetics Inc. As a sequence-specificity control, two different scrambled versions of FREG-(48–58) (KHIAQLDEPLQ and KLQLDIEAHPQ), were synthesized by Neosystem Laboratoire. They are here referred to as SCR. Peptide purity, assessed by reverse-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, was higher than 95% in all cases. Different batches of FREG-(48–58) and SCR gave similar results in all biological assays.Figure 1Sequence alignment and structure analysis. A, FGF family alignment. Sequence alignment of 23 FGFs (all human, except FGF 15, of unknown source) was achieved by ClustalW software available at emb1.bcc.univie.ac.at/embnet/progs/clustal/. FGFs accession numbers are: FGF1, XP_054732; FGF2, XP_055784; FGF3, NP_005238; FGF4, XP_053627; FGF5, P12034; FGF6, P10767; FGF7, XP_017651; FGF8, BAA28605; FGF9, NP_002001; FGF10, NP_004456; FGF11,AAL15439; FGF12, XP_003135; FGF13isoform 1A, NP_004105; FGF14, NP_004106; FGF15, AR015075; FGF16, NP_003859; FGF17, NP_003858; FGF18, NP_387498; FGF19, AAH17664; FGF20, NP_062825; FGF21, NP_061986; FGF22, NP_065688; FGF23, NP_065689. The alignment is reported for the FGF-2 portion whose crystallographic coordinates are available. The consensus sequence at 60% identity level is reported (boxedresidues on yellow background). FREG-(48–58) is indicated in red. Blue cylinders indicate regions predicted to be involved in FGF-2 dimerization according to the predicted dimer reported in panel B. Residues interacting with the receptor, identified according to solvent accessibility analysis on the PDB structure 1FQ9 (20), were: His-16, Phe-17, Lys-18, Lys-21, Tyr-24, Lys-26, Gly-28, Gly-29, Phe-31, Arg-44, Lys-46, Gln-54, Leu-55, Gln-56, Ala-57, Gln-58, Glu-59, Arg-60, Gly-61, Val-63, Ser-64, Tyr-73, Val-88, Glu-96, Arg-97, Leu-98, Glu-99, Ser-100, Asn-101, Asn-102, Tyr-103, Asn-104, Gly-131, Pro-132, Gly-133, Gln-134, Lys-135, Leu-138, Leu-140, Pro-141. Predicted dimerization sites and observed receptor-interacting residues partially overlap in the FREG-(48–58) region. Gaps longer than two positions were reported as the number indicating the gap length. B, docking simulation of two FGF-2 monomers (PDB code: 2BFH) achieved with GRAMM software. The two chains are colored in blue and green;red segments correspond to residues 48–58 selected to designate FREG-(48–58) and appear to be at the dimer interface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) BAEC were derived from adult bovine aorta and cultured as previously reported (40Giampietri C. Levrero M. Felici A. D'Alessio A. Capogrossi M.C. Gaetano C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 292-301Google Scholar). Cell purity was evaluated by DiI-Ac-LDL uptake and was consistently >97%. BAEC at passage 3–7 and at 80% confluence were used in all assays. Proliferation assays were carried out as previously reported (31De Marchis F. Ribatti D. Giampietri C. Lentini A. Faraone D. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. Blood. 2002; 99: 2045-2053Google Scholar). After 24 h of starvation, BAEC were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-BSA (0.1%) alone or containing human recombinant growth factors (10 ng/ml) as reported, in the absence or in the presence of FREG-(48–58) or SCR, the antibody raised against FREG-(48–58) (AbFREG-(48–58)), or preimmune control serum (AbP-I). BSA fraction V (Sigma) was used throughout the study. Time course experiments were carried out at 1-, 2-, and 3-day time points at 10 ng/ml FREG-(48–58) concentration. Cells were then harvested and counted with a hemacytometer. The FREG-(48–58) dose used in most experiments (i.e. 10 ng/ml) was identified in dose dependence tests carried out in cell proliferation and receptor phosphorylation experiments. Migration assays were carried out in modified Boyden chambers (Costar Scientific Corporation) as previously reported (31De Marchis F. Ribatti D. Giampietri C. Lentini A. Faraone D. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. Blood. 2002; 99: 2045-2053Google Scholar). Briefly, BAEC seeded on gelatin-coated polycarbonate filters (12-μm pores) (Costar) were exposed to FGF-2 (Invitrogen), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (RnD Systems), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Invitrogen), or fibronectin (Invitrogen) human recombinant factors, dissolved at the reported concentration in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 0.1% BSA. FREG-(48–58) or SCR were supplemented to the growth factor solution at the reported final concentration. Assays were carried out at 37 °C in 5% CO2, for 6 h. Migrated cells were counted at ×400 magnification in 15 fields for each filter, and the average number ± S.D. of cells/field was reported. All experiments were performed at least three times in duplicate. Chemical modification of histidine residues was achieved by diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treatment, which specifically modifies the imidazolic ring of histidine residues (41Miles E.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 431-442Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of a freshly prepared DEPC solution (Sigma) in anhydrous ethanol was added to FGF-2 in PBS, to reach 200 μm DEPC and 55 μm FGF-2 final concentration. After 15 min at 25 °C the reaction was stopped with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). DEPC-induced modification of FREG-(48–58) was carried out similarly. In control experiments DEPC was first inactivated by prior incubation with 100 mm Tris-HCl, and then added to the sample. Histidine-modified FREG-(48–58) and FGF-2 were then tested in SPR (see below) and migration assays. Biotinylation was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Briefly, FREG-(48–58) (2 mg/ml) or FGF-2 (20 μg/ml) in PBS (500 μl) (pH 7.4) were incubated with 2 mm EZ-Linksulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature to label amines. The excess reagent was quenched by incubation with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was then dialyzed against PBS; biotinylated FREG-(48–58) was then immediately used in an overlay assay, and biotinylated FGF-2 was immediately used in internalization assays. Fluorescence spectroscopy experiments were carried out as previously reported with modifications (29Russo K. Ragone R. Facchiano A.M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1284-1291Google Scholar, 42Russo K. Di Stasio E. Macchia G. Rosa G. Brancaccio A. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 274: 93-98Google Scholar) on a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorimeter at constant temperature (22 °C). Briefly, 10 aliquots (0.5 μl each) of FREG-(48–58) or SCR (85 μm, 0.1 mg/ml in PBS) were subsequently added to 90 μl of FGF-2 in PBS (2 μm, 36 μg/ml). Under these conditions, the FGF-2 sample reached only 5% dilution. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected by excitation at 277 nm. Peak fluorescence was at 310 nm as previously reported for similar experimental conditions (43Vemuri S. Beylin I Sluzky V. Stratton P. Eberlein G. Wang Y.J. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 481-486Google Scholar). Data were corrected for the buffer, FREG-(48–58), and SCR contributions and for the dilution factor, and its value was plotted as a function of the amount of peptide supplemented. Data were analyzed according to the single site tight binding model (44Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 221-257Google Scholar). SPR experiments were carried out as previously reported (29Russo K. Ragone R. Facchiano A.M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1284-1291Google Scholar, 45Goretzki L. Burg M.A. Grako K.A. Stallcup W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16831-16837Google Scholar) on the BIAcoreX instrument (Amersham Biosciences Biosensor AB). FGF-2 or recombinant human FGF-R1β (IIIC)/FC chimera (RnD Systems) were covalently coupled to the CM5 sensor chip by injecting FGF-2 or FGF-R1 (80 μl, 1.25 μg/ml and 55.5 μg/ml, respectively) dissolved in 30 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.8. Immobilized FGF-2 and FGF-R1 achieved about 500 and 7500 Resonance Units (RU), respectively, corresponding approximately to 0.5 and 7.5 ng/mm2, respectively (46Bailly S. Brand C. Chambaz E.M. Feige J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16329-16334Google Scholar). Immobilized FGF-2 was recognized by injecting a goat anti-human FGF-2 antibody (RnD Systems). All experiments were performed using HBS (10 mmHepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) as running buffer and as a dilution buffer for FGF-2. In additional experiments, biotinylated low molecular weight heparin (2.6 mg/ml in HBS containing 0.3 m NaCl, 30 μl) was captured onto a BIAcore SA chip (carrying streptavidin onto the surface) via biotin-streptavidin interaction at a 5 μl/min flow rate. Under these conditions immobilized heparin reached about 200 RU. FGF-2 (20 μl, 1.25 μg/ml) was injected for a 2-min association phase with or without increasing concentrations of FREG-(48–58) or SCR, followed by HBS flow for a 30-s dissociation phase. Response, monitored at 25 °C, was expressed in RU. Sensor chip regeneration was achieved by NaOH injections (50 mm, 10 μl each). A 10 μl/min flow rate was used throughout the experiments. Either FGF-2 or BSA (300 ng) were spotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane as previously reported (29Russo K. Ragone R. Facchiano A.M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1284-1291Google Scholar), then blocked with 5% dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TPBS (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS). In addition to BSA, an additional control was introduced, corresponding to the mix of molecular weight standards (Amersham Biosciences) listed in the legend of Fig. 4. After the TPBS wash, the membrane was incubated with biotinylated FREG-(48–58) (2 ml, 200 μg/ml) for 4 h at room temperature and washed again. Interaction was detected by an avidin/biotinylated horseradish peroxidase kit (Vectstain ABC, from Vector) followed by chemiluminescent reaction and exposure to Kodak film (Eastman Kodak). FGF-2 internalization was measured as described (47Hagedorn M. Zilberberg L. Lozano R.M. Cuevas P. Canron X. Redondo-Horcajo M. Gimenez-Gallego G. Bikfalvi A. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 550-552Google Scholar). BAEC (5 × 105) were incubated with biotinylated FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of either FREG-(48–58) (20 ng/ml), SCR (20 ng/ml), mAb 125 (monoclonal antibody neutralizing FGF-2 receptor, Chemicon) (500 ng/ml), rabbit AbFREG48–58 (1:200 dilution), or rabbit preimmune serum (AbP-I) (1:200) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. After 1 h, cells were washed and cell surface-bound material was extracted by washing with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) and with 2 m NaCl in 20 mm acetic acid (pH 4.0) and discarded. Cells were then lysed with lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), and the total lysate was immobilized onto nitrocellulose and blocked with 5% dry milk in TPBS. After washing with TPBS, biotinylated FGF-2 was then revealed with the Vectstain ABC Kit as in overlay experiments. The film was then subjected to densitometry analysis (GS 710, Bio-Rad). After 24 h of starvation, BAEC were incubated with FGF-2 (10 ng/ml) diluted in 0.1% BSA, in the absence or in the presence of FREG-(48–58) or SCR (10 ng/ml) for 10 min. Cells were then washed in ice-cold PBS and scraped with lysis buffer (as above). Cell extracts were sonicated and centrifuged, and supernatants were collected. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out on samples (60 μg of protein) by incubating with anti-FGF receptor antibody (mAb 125, Chemicon) (2 μg) at 4 °C overnight on a rocking bath, followed by incubation with 10 μg of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (AmershamBiosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing with lysis buffer, complexes were dissolved in Laemmli buffer, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, blocked as reported above, incubated with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (clone PT66, Sigma) (1:2000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, revealed by chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences), and quantified by densitometry. Antibody against FREG-(48–58) (AbFREG48–58) was developed according to standard protocols. Briefly, FREG-(48–58) (1 mg) dissolved in 2 ml of PBS and supplemented with Complete Freund's Adjuvant, was administered by intramuscular injection in two 5-month-old New Zealand rabbits. After 22 and 44 days the antigen injection was repeated with un-complete Freund's Adjuvant. Fifteen days after the third injection, blood was collected, and the serum was separated and stored at −20 °C in aliquots. Before some experiments, rabbit serum was collected after four antigen injections and showed activity at a higher dilution. The ability of this antibody to recognize the whole FGF-2 was tested by spotting increasing quantities of FGF-2 (up to 100 ng/spot) onto nitrocellulose membranes and then blocking with 5% dry milk. After TPBS washing, membranes were incubated with AbFREG48–58 (1:200 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were then washed and incubated with anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Pierce) for 1 h at room temperature; detection was achieved by chemiluminescence (AmershamBiosciences). FREG-(48–58) up to 100 ng/ml was used to compete for the observed interaction between FGF-2 and AbFREG48–58. AbFREG48–58 was then used in internalization and proliferation assays as reported. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted according to the institutional guidelines, in compliance with international laws and policies (Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals; United States National Research Council, 1996). CAM assays were performed as previously reported (31De Marchis F. Ribatti D. Giampietri C. Lentini A. Faraone D. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. Blood. 2002; 99: 2045-2053Google Scholar). Fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs (10/group) were incubated at 37 °C at constant humidity. On incubation day 3, 2 ml of albumin were removed to allow detachment of the developing CAM. The window was sealed with a glass and the eggs returned to the incubator. On day 8, CAM was treated by applying the sponge as reported in the legend to Fig. 8. On day 12, blood vessels entering the sponge within the focal plane of the CAM and were counted at ×50 magnification in a double-blind fashion under a Zeiss SR stereomicroscope (Zeiss) and photographed in ovo with the MC63 Camera System (Zeiss). Embryos and their membranes were fixed in ovo in Bouin's fluid. Sponges, the underlying and immediately adjacent portions of CAM were removed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 8 μm along a plane parallel to the CAM surface, and stained with a 0.5% aqueous solution of toluidine blue (Merck). The angiogenic response was assessed histologically by a planimetric method of “point counting” (48Ribatti D. Gualandris A. Bastaki M. Vacca A. Iurlaro M. Roncali L. Presta M. J. Vasc. Res. 1997; 34: 455-463Google Scholar). The vascular density was indicated as the mean number of the occupied intersection points ± S.D. The angiogenesis assay in Matrigel plugs was carried out as reported (31De Marchis F. Ribatti D. Giampietri C. Lentini A. Faraone D. Scoccianti M. Capogrossi M.C. Facchiano A. Blood. 2002; 99: 2045-2053Google Scholar, 49Facchiano F. Lentini A. Fogliano V. Mancarella S. Rossi C. Facchiano A. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Pathology. 2002; 161: 531-541Google Scholar). Briefly, Matrigel, a mixture of reconstituted basement membrane proteins (BD PharMingen, 600 μl) supplemented with FGF-2 (150 ng/ml) alone or in the presence of FREG-(48–58) or SCR (10 μg/ml), was injected subcutaneously in CD1 mice (female, 20 g body weight). Matrigel plugs were removed after 8 days and processed for histology analysis. Histologic sections (7 μm) were stained with Trichrome-Masson procedure (Bio-Optica). Vessels within the Matrigel were recognized by morphology and by the presence of red blood cells. Angiogenesis was evaluated blindly by two operators, by considering at least five different sections per Matrigel plug; each section was 100 μm from the next. The total number of neo-vessels in the whole Matrigel area was measured with an Axioplan microscope (Zeiss) and was expressed as the number of vessels/mm2. When 2 vessels were cut longitudinally, as indicated by a long axis greater than 3-fold of the short axis, and were close to each other, they were counted as a single vessel. Ten animals were treated with FGF-2 alone, 14 with FGF-2 + FREG-(48–58), 10 with FGF-2 + SCR. Data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Student's two-tailed t test was performed, andp ≤ 0.01 was considered statistically significant. Primary sequence analysis and three-dimensional structure evaluation were carried out on human FGF-2. A multiple sequence alignment was performed on the 23 members of the human fibroblast growth factor family (Fig.1 A). According to the consensus sequence at the 60% identity level, several residues are conserved within the family, while other regions show a high variability. In particular, the FGF-2 region 43–60 was found to be poorly conserved within the FGF family. A docking simulation was carried out on two FGF-2 monomers (PDB code: 2BFH) leading to the prediction of a FGF-2 dimer (Fig.1 B); therefore regions at the dimer interface were predicted by solvent accessibility evaluation. Finally, on the high-resolution crystallographic model of the FGF-2/FGR1-heparin complex (PDB file:1FQ9), regions interacting with the FGF-R1 were identified by solvent accessibility analysis (reported in the legend of Fig. 1 A). According to all these analyses, the FGF-2 region 43–60 shows one of the lowest intrafamily identities and, at the same time, many residues of this segment were predicted to be involved in FGF-2 dimerization and were found to be involved in receptor binding. All together these observations suggested that this portion of FGF-2 may play a specific role in FGF-2 dimerization and receptor binding. To investigate this hypothesis, the following strategies were addressed: (i) one peptide derived from this region was designed, s"

Among of the most cytotoxic DNA lesions are double strand breaks (DSBs) caused by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic chemicals. ATM is missing or inactivated in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia patients display a pleiotropic phenotype and suffer primarily from progressive ataxia caused by degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons. Additional features are immunodeficiency, genomic instability, radiation sensitivity, and cancer predisposition. Disruption of the mouse Atm locus creates a murine model of ataxia-telangiectasia that exhibits most of the clinical features of the human disease but very mild neuronal abnormality. The ATM protein is a multifunctional protein kinase, which serves as a master regulator of cellular responses to DSBs. There is growing evidence that ATM may be involved in addition to the DSB response in other processes that maintain processes in cellular homeostasis. For example, mounting evidence points to increased oxidative stress in the absence of ATM. Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in the brains of Atm-deficient mice not treated with DNA damaging agents. A canonical activation (increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-4, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, and c-Jun) of the AP-1 pathway was found in Atm-deficient cerebra, whereas induction of the AP-1 pathway in Atm-deficient cerebella is likely to mediate elevated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun. Although Atm+/+ mice are capable of responding to ionizing radiation by activating stress responses such as the AP-1 pathway, Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to ionizing radiation. Our results further demonstrate that inactivation of the ATM gene results in a state of constant stress. Maintenance of genome stability is essential for keeping cellular homeostasis.

To activate the DNA damage response, ATM phosphorylates a number of downstream targets, including p53, Mdm2, Brca1, Chk2, and Nbs1 (reviewed in Refs. 3Shiloh Y. Kastan M.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 83: 209-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and 4Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Jackson S.P. Mulhern T.D. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 1052-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ATM is activated by DSBs induced by internal or external DNA damaging agents, such as IR, radiomimetic chemicals, and reactive oxygen species and is probably activated also by DSBs that occur normally during meotic and V(D)J recombination. ATM can bind to DNA in vitro (11Smith G.C. Cary R.B. Lakin N.D. Hann B.C. Teo S.H. Chen D.J. Jackson S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11134-11139Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 12Suzuki K. Kodama S. Watanabe M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25571-25575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and a fraction of ATM binds tightly to the chromatin following the induction of DSBs, in accordance with the suggested role of ATM in the early steps of the DNA damage response. Evidence is accumulating that ATM is also involved in maintaining genomic stability under normal conditions of apparently no stress. Because it appears to mediate IR-induced death in the murine-developing nervous system (13Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetaki M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that it functions during nervous system development to eliminate neuronal cells afflicted with genomic damage (13Herzog K.H. Chong M.J. Kapsetaki M. Morgan J.I. McKinnon P.J. Science. 1998; 280: 1089-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). ATM was also shown to be required for the execution of apoptosis in all areas of the developing nervous system in a model of a DNA ligase IV-deficient mouse (14Lee Y. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. McKinnon P.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2576-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). One of the major stress responses is mediated by the AP-1 transcription factor. AP-1 is a superfamily of proteins consisting of several subfamilies, including Jun, Fos, and ATF-2, all of which possess a leucine zipper domain that assists their dimerization (15Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3279) Google Scholar). The AP-1 proteins form homo- and heterodimers before binding to their DNA target sites. The activation of AP-1 is regulated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), ERK, and p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) (16Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar, 17Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). JNKs are a family of serine-threonine kinases related to the MAPKs with at least 10 isoforms encoded by three genes (JNK1,JNK2, and JNK3), with additional diversification resulting from alternative splicing (18Gupta S.

The JNK1 and JNK2 subfamilies each comprise four isoforms (46 or 55 kDa), whereas the JNK3 contains two different isoforms (45–48 or 54–57 kDa). Although JNK1 and JNK2 are expressed in most cell types (23Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; : 8Google Scholar), expression of JNK3 is limited to neuronal cells (18Gupta S. Barrett T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar). All JNKs possess a conserved TPY tripeptide motif in their kinase domain (Thr-183 and Tyr-185) (22Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H.

Although all JNKs are capable of phosphorylating c-Jun on serine residues 63 and 73, isoforms exhibit different substrate-binding specificities (37Sluss H.K. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol.

In vitro studies have revealed a defect in IR-induced activation of the JNK-signaling pathway in lymphoblastoid cells from individuals with A-T. Although IR induced c-Jun phosphorylation in normal cells, no such phenomenon was observed in A-T fibroblasts. The 46-kDa isoform of JNKs was dually phosphorylated in the nuclei of both normal and A-T fibroblast following exposure to IR, whereas c-Jun activity was detected in normal cells but not in A-T fibroblasts. Furthermore, an exogenous-purified active JNK protein was able to phosphorylate endogenous c-Jun in nuclear extracts only of normal but not A-T cells and only after the normal cells were irradiated, (39Lee S.A. Dritschilo A. Jung M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32889-32894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we report that the AP-1 pathway is constantly active in untreated Atm-deficient brain. Atm+/+ mice are capable of responding to IR by activating the AP-1 pathway, whereas Atm-deficient mice display higher basal AP-1 activity but gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to IR. Atm+/− mice (5Barlow C. Hirotsune S. Paylor R. Liyanage M. Eckhaus M. Collins F. Shiloh Y. Crawley J.N. Ried T. Tagle D. Wynshaw-Boris A. Cell. 1996; 86: 159-171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar) were a generous gift from Dr. Wynshaw-Boris. Offspring of these mice were genotyped by PCR-based assays using mouse-tail DNA, prepared with the GeneReleaserTM reagent (Bio-Ventures Co., Murfreesboro, TN). Tissues (cerebellum and cerebrum) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized in ice-cold homogenation buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.2 mmNaVO3, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin (400 μl for cerebellum and 1.5 ml for cerebrum)). The lysates were sonicated and then centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g. The pellets were removed and the supernatants were collected and frozen. Tissues (cerebellum, cerebrum, and liver) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffer saline and maintained in 0.32 m sucrose. The organs were homogenized in ice-cold hypotonic buffer B (0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmPMSF and protease inhibitor mixture) and 0.2 mmNa3VO4. The lysates were allowed to incubate for 15 min on ice and then centrifuged for 10 min at 7,500 × g. The supernatants were removed (cytoplasmic extracts), and the nuclear pellets were rinsed once with ice-cold buffer B and resuspended in buffer C (0.42 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.2 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 0.2 mm NaVO3(100 μl for cerebellum, 400 μl for cerebrum, and 0.5 ml for liver)). The nuclear extracts were incubated for 45 min on ice and centrifuged for 20 min at 15,500 × g. The supernatants were collected and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and Western blot analyses. The binding reaction mixture containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 2 μg of bovine serum albumin, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 15,000 cpm of 32P-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′, respectively) (Promega, Madison, WI) was incubated for 30 min with 6 μg of nuclear extract. For AP-1-binding activity the reaction was done on ice. For specificity control a 50-fold excess of unlabeled probe was applied. Products were analyzed on a 5% acrylamide gel made up in 1 × TGE (50 mm Tris, 400 mm glycine, 2 mmEDTA). Dried gels were exposed to x-ray film or to phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitative data were obtained using phosphoimaging analysis (Molecular Dynamics). Western blotting was performed as described by Harlow and Lane (61Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar), using 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (PAGE). Each lane was loaded with an identical amount of protein extract (50 or 100 μg), which, following electrophoresis, were transferred to an Immobilon polyvinyldene disulfide membrane for 1.5 h. Blots were stained with Ponceau to verify equal loading and transfer of proteins. Membranes were then probed with anti-phospho-JNK (1:1000) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), mouse anti-c-Jun (1:1000) antibodies (BD Biosciences), mouse anti-c-Fos (1:400) antibodies (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser-63) (1:1000) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-phospho-MKK4 (1:1000) antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA). For the detection of phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun, EnVisionTM+/horseradish peroxidase (rabbit, 1:100) (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) was used to enhance sensitivity. The rest of the antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (1:25000 for mouse and 1:15000 for rabbit) purchased from Jackson Laboratories. Intensity of the signal was determined by the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (62Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 254-257Crossref Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as standard. Results were analyzed using two-tailed Student's t test. Data were expressed as mean ±S.E., andp values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant. The AP-1-signaling pathway is one of the most prominent pathways known to respond to various stress conditions. Alterations in the activity of this pathway in a particular tissue imply that it is under stress. To test whether tissues of Atm-deficient mice are under constant stress, we analyzed the basal level of AP-1 DNA-binding activity in the brains of Atm−/−- and Atm+/+-untreated mice. In 1-month-old animals, the differences in AP-1 activity between Atm−/− and Atm+/+ cerebella and cerebra were significant but rather small (45% induction in Atm−/− animals,p < 0.025 for the cerebellum and p < 0.0023 for the cerebrum). In 4-month-old animals, there was a 3-fold constant induction of AP-1 activity in Atm-deficient tissues (p < 0.0079 for the cerebellum and p< 0.0264 for the cerebrum) (Fig.1 A). The nervous system, especially the cerebellum, is highly affected in A-T; other organs such as the liver are not known to be involved. This coincides with our earlier findings that the cerebellum but not the liver is under constant oxidative stress (40Kamsler A. Daily D. Hochman A. Stern N. Shiloh Y. Rotman G. Barzilai A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1849-1854PubMed Google Scholar). To correlate the degree of stress to AP-1 DNA-binding activity, we measured that activity in livers isolated from 4-month-old Atm−/−- and Atm+/+-untreated animals. Atm-deficient mice and their control littermates displayed similar levels of AP-1 DNA-binding activity (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, the results presented in Fig. 1 show that organs most affected in A-T display higher levels of AP-1 DNA-binding activity, whereas non-affected organs behave like controls. The earlier step in the signaling pathway that leads to AP-1 induction is JNK-mediated phosphoryaltion of the N terminus of c-Jun. This phosphorylation activates its dimerization (either with Jun or Fos isoforms) and binding to its target consensus sequence. To test whether Atm loss leads to increased JNK activity, we measured the levels of phospho-JNK, the activated form of this enzyme (Fig.2). There was a gradual increase in phospho-JNK levels in Atm-deficient brains, from no change compared with normal tissue at the age of 1 month to close to 3-fold induction at 4 months (p < 3.05 × 10−5 for the cerebellum and p < 0.0037 for the cerebrum). The level of JNK induction correlates well with the induction of AP-1 DNA-binding activity (compare Figs. 1 and 2). MKK4 is among the kinases capable of activating JNK. To explore whether Atm loss leads to constant activation of MKK4, we examined the levels of activated MKK4 in 4-month-old cerebra and cerebella. Interestingly, we found elevation (67% increase,p < 0.03) only in Atm-deficient cerebra and not in the cerebella (Fig. 3). Atm−/−mice and their control littermates were exposed to 20 Gy of x-rays for different time periods, after which the levels of AP-1 DNA-binding activity were assayed. At 4 months of age, Atm+/+ brains responded to the irradiation treatment with 2.5-fold induction in AP-1 DNA-binding activity (Fig 4). A different pattern of AP-1 induction was observed between Atm+/+cerebellum and cerebrum. The Atm+/+ cerebellum displayed a clear peak of AP-1 induction around 60 min post-irradiation, whereas the cerebrum showed a rapid and steady induction in AP-1 levels. In contrast, 4-month-old Atm−/− mice failed to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to IR, and the levels of AP-1 remained unchanged (Fig. 5,right panel). Interestingly, young Atm−/− mice retained their ability to induce AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to IR (Fig. 4, left panel). Similar to Atm+/+, 2-fold induction in AP-1 DNA-binding activity was measured in these Atm−/− cerebella and cerebra. These results suggest that damage accumulation is gradually accompanied by loss of the ability of Atm-deficient mice to activate stress responses as a result of noxious stimuli such as IR.Figure 5Alterations in phospho-JNK (P-JNK) levels in Atm−/− and Atm+/+ brains following exposure to 20 Gy x-ray. Nuclear extracts were isolated from the cerebrum and cerebellum of 1-month-old (upper panel) and 4-month-old (lower panel) irradiated and untreated Atm−/− and Atm+/+ mice. The extracted protein was separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinyldene disulfide membrane and treated as indicated in the legend to Fig. 2. The animals (n = 2 per each time point) were irradiated (20 Gy) and samples taken at the indicated time points. Quantitative analysis of bands was performed using TINA software and normalized to the corresponding tubulin. ●, Atm+/+ cerebellum; ○, Atm−/− cerebellum; ▪, Atm+/+ cerebrum; and ■, Atm−/−cerebrum. Quantitative analysis of bands is represented by arbitrary units Atm+/+-untreated mice (n = 6–8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next we assayed the ability of Atm−/− and Atm+/+ mice to activate JNK in response to 20 Gy x-ray. Similar results were obtained in younger (1-month-old) and older (4-month-old) Atm−/− and Atm+/+ mice. In both cases, the peak of phospho-JNK induction was around 60 min post-irradiation (Fig. 5). Four-month-old Atm-deficient mice are incapable of activating AP-1 DNA-binding activity, but notably they were capable of elevating phospho-JNK levels in response to IR to a level similar to their control littermates. These results suggest that accumulating damage may not affect JNK activity in response to IR but rather events downstream to it. Atm-deficient mice were capable of activating JNK in response to IR but failed to induce AP-1 DNA-binding activity. To test whether Atm loss disrupts the ability of JNK to phosphorylate its target proteins, we analyzed the levels of phospho-c-Jun in the cerebra and cerebella of untreated and irradiated animals. Using antibody directed against c-Jun phosphorylated on Ser-63, we observed a 50% increase in phospho-c-Jun levels (p < 0.017) in cerebra of 4-month-old untreated Atm-deficient mice. In contrast, no change in Ser(P)-63-c-Jun levels was observed in Atm-deficient cerebella (Fig.6, upper panel). Exposing the animals to 20 Gy x-ray resulted in a gradual increase (2–3-fold) in Ser(P)-63-c-Jun levels only in the cerebra of 1-month- and 4-month-old Atm+/+ mice, but not in the same tissues of Atm−/− mice. Elevated levels of either c-Jun or c-Fos proteins can lead to constant AP-1 activation. To test whether Atm deficiency leads to alterations in c-Jun and c-Fos levels, we analyzed the basal levels of these proteins in untreated Atm-deficient cerebella and cerebra. Using antibody directed against c-Fos, we observed a more than 3-fold increase in c-Fos levels (p < 0.019) in cerebella of 4-month-old untreated Atm-deficient mice compared with Atm+/+ animals. Smaller induction in c-Fos levels (1.8-fold, p < 0.032) was observed in the cerebra. Elevated levels of c-Jun were observed only in 4-month-old untreated Atm-deficient cerebella (2.5-fold, p < 0.0242). No change in c-Jun levels was observed in Atm-deficient cerebra (Fig.7). Alterations in the activity of the AP-1-signaling pathway in a given tissue imply that the tissue may be under stress. The data reported here, together with other reports (40Kamsler A. Daily D.

DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), further substantiate the facts that organs most affected in A-T patients gradually develop stress conditions. Several of our findings support this notion: (a) Atm-deficient brains, but not Atm-deficient livers, display higher basal AP-1 DNA-binding activity. (b) Untreated Atm-deficient cerebra and cerebella display elevated levels of phospho-JNK. (c) Atm-deficient mice gradually lose their ability to activate AP-1 DNA-binding activity in response to IR, suggesting that the system is either saturated and can no longer respond to stress stimuli, or accumulated damage disrupts the signaling pathways mediating radiation-induced AP-1 activation. (d) There are increased levels of phospho-c-Jun in untreated Atm-deficient cerebra. (e) There are elevated levels of c-Fos in untreated Atm-deficient cerebella. Our concept that Atm loss leads to constant stress in organs most affected in A-T is further supported by our recent findings using microarray DNA chips. Initial analysis revealed that unirradiated Atm-deficient cerebella displayed constitutive activation of repression of numerous genes that the corresponding wild type cerebella showed only after irradiation. 2S.

AP-1 DNA-binding activity can be induced in two ways: by increased transcription of c-Jun or Fos, or by phosphorylation of the Jun proteins, mainly by different JNK isoforms (for review see Ref.44Weston C.R.

Presumably these interactions explain why coordination of leading and lagging strand synthesis in vitro is dependent upon gene 2.5 protein (13Lee J. Chastain 2nd, P.D. Kusakabe T. Griffith J.D.

Chiu W. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 579-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mode of binding of gene 2.5 protein to ssDNA differs from that of E. coli SSB and T4 gene 32 protein. Using a fluorescence based study gene 2.5 protein was found to have a binding constant for ssDNA binding of 1.2 × 106m−1 (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) a value that is less than one-tenth the affinity exhibited by E. coli SSB (18Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition, gene 2.5 protein binds ssDNA with limited, if any, cooperativity (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kimet al. (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dimer formation is postulated to be dependent upon the interactions of its highly acidic carboxyl terminus (21Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5270-5278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its association with the other replication proteins is also facilitated by its carboxyl-terminal amino acids (13Lee J.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar). As the name suggests this fold is found in proteins that bind either ssDNA such as E. coli SSB protein (26Raghunathan S.

Hol W.G. Nature. 1992; 355: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The OB fold is comprised of a five-stranded anti-parallel β barrel, capped with an α helix. The location of this helix varies among DNA-binding proteins. In gene 2.5 protein this helix is found between the second and third strands (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas in both human replication protein A and E. coli SSB protein it connects the third and forth strands (27Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 30Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In gene 2.5 protein loop extensions from two of the β sheets form a prominent groove on the surface of the fold. This groove most likely represents the ssDNA interface and in Fig. 1 ssDNA is modeled into the crystal structure along this position. Located within this groove of gene 2.5 protein are two aromatic residues, tyrosine 111 and tyrosine 158. These aromatic residues, in addition to the adjacent β stands and their connecting loops comprise an evolutionarily conserved trinucleotide binding motif (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) that binds three nucleotides in an orientation analogous with other ssDNA-binding proteins (27Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 30Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. Nature. 1997; 385: 176-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). A number of basic residues (Lys3, Arg35, Lys107, Lys109, Lys150, and Lys152) lie in proximity to this trinucleotide binding motif forming a positively charged cleft, suggesting a role in the interaction with ssDNA (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, prior to the current study, there was no direct evidence that implicates these residues in binding ssDNA.In the current study we have sought experimental evidence to support our hypothesis that the DNA binding domain lies within the OB fold of gene 2.5 protein. A previously reported random mutagenesis screen of gene 2.5 (35Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) uncovered a number of lethal mutations that lead to alterations in amino acids that were predicted by the crystal structure to interact with ssDNA. Here we show that both the highly conserved aromatic residue Tyr158, one component of the trinucleotide binding motif, and the positively charged Lys152, flanking this motif, are required for the interaction with ssDNA. In addition we provide evidence for the involvement of Lys109 in the protein-DNA interaction. Finally, we show that the carboxyl-terminal tail deleted protein, gp2.5-Δ26C, binds DNA with a greater affinity than the wild-type protein.DISCUSSIONThere is a significant lack of knowledge on the structure-function relationship of the product of bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5, a ssDNA-binding protein. In the current study we sought to define the DNA binding domain of gp2.5. This study provides the first experimental evidence for the identity of the DNA binding domain of gp2.5. In a separate report (35Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) we describe a genetic screen for lethal mutations in bacteriophage T7 gene 2.5. By examining the crystal structure of the protein (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) we noted that a subset of these generated mutations lay in the postulated ssDNA binding domain. In this study we have biochemically characterized these altered gene 2.5 proteins and show that two of them, gp2.5-Y158C and gp2.5-K152E, are indeed defective in their interaction with ssDNA. A third, gp2.5-K109I, appears to interact differently with ssDNA when assessed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We feel confident that the defective phenotypes do not arise from a misfolding of the protein as they physically interact with both T7 DNA polymerase and the gene 4 protein, a helicase/primase. In addition, all four proteins form dimers in a manner similar to the wild-type protein.At the onset of these studies the amino acids involved in the interaction of gene 2.5 protein with ssDNA were unknown. Previous studies on other ssDNA-binding proteins have shown that aromatic residues have the potential to intercalate between the nucleic acid bases thus stabilizing the protein-ssDNA interaction (27Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 41Khamis M.I. Casas-Finet J.R. Maki A.H. Murphy J.B. Chase J.W.

Nature. 1995; 376: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the E. coli SSB protein for example mutational studies have implicated phenylalanine 60 (Phe60) and tyrptophan 54 (Trp54) in binding ssDNA (44Casas-Finet J.R. Khamis M.I. Maki A.H. Chase J.W. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 45Ferrari M.E. Fang J. Lohman T.M. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 64: 235-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 46Curth U. Greipel J. Urbanke C. Maass G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2585-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similarly, in T4 gene 32, protein site-directed mutagenesis has identified numerous tyrosine residues necessary for the proteins interaction with ssDNA (47Shamoo Y. Ghosaini L.R. Keating K.M. Williams K.R. Sturtevant J.M. Konigsberg W.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7409-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 48Pan T. King G.C. Coleman J.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8833-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). T7 gene 2.5 protein possesses one such structurally conserved aromatic residue found in the OB fold. Based on our observation that the lethal substitution Y158C gives rise to a gene 2.5 protein that has a higher dissociation constant for ssDNA than that of wild-type gene 2.5 protein, we can infer that this residue plays an essential role in binding to ssDNA. Similarly, the altered gp2.5-Y111C/Y158C is also defective in binding ssDNA although the binding constant is similar to that of gp2.5-Y158C alone, implying that tyrosine 111 is not essential for ssDNA binding. This result was unexpected as an aromatic residue is conserved at this site among other ssDNA-binding proteins, specifically phenylalanine 60 in E. coli SSB protein and phenylalanine 90 in human replication protein A protein (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).Basic residues, which can make electrostatic contacts with the negatively charged phosphates in ssDNA, are also likely candidates for DNA binding. Lysine residues have been shown to be involved in the ability of E. coli SSB protein to bind ssDNA (27Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 49Chen J. Smith D.L. Griep M.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1781-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Indeed we have shown that substituting lysine 152 with glutamic acid weakens its binding to ssDNA, as this variant protein exhibits a 10-fold decrease in its affinity for ssDNA. Interestingly, the protein·DNA complex resulting from this interaction has difficulty adopting the slower mobility complex at concentrations comparable with wild-type gene 2.5 protein, as discussed in more detail below. Perhaps Lys152 is involved in an interaction of gene 2.5 with ssDNA at higher concentrations, and this interaction leads to the higher order structure in a manner similar to the E. coli SSB protein, which demonstrates distinct binding modes at different protein concentrations (18Lohman T.M. Ferrari M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 527-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). In addition, the side chain of Lys152is oriented away from the prominent groove in the crystal structure, decreasing its direct accessibility to ssDNA bound at this site. Therefore to implicate Lys152 in binding ssDNA, the ssDNA would somehow have to wrap around the protein, suggesting that the interaction encompasses more residues than those lying directly within this groove. A structural based sequence alignment of other ssDNA-binding proteins does not reveal conservation at this particular residue (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and therefore, perhaps this interaction is a unique feature of the gene 2.5 protein.A second lethal mutation resulting in the alteration of a basic residue was identified at Lys109. In contrast to gp2.5-K152E, this K109I variant gene 2.5 protein failed to inhibit the ability of gene 2.5 protein to bind ssDNA despite the loss of a positively charged residue in the OB fold. Interestingly gp2.5-K109I displayed an aberrant binding pattern in the gel shift assay, forming only the slower mobility complex. This binding pattern was also exhibited by gp2.5-Δ26C, which likewise failed to form the rapidly migrating complex. Originally this binding pattern was thought to indicate a level of cooperative binding to ssDNA not characteristic of the native protein. However, upon closer examination, the appropriate kinetic calculations, i.e. Hill coefficients, could not support this theory. Further dissection of the binding mode(s) of the native protein may lead to an explanation of this observation.Based on the crystal structure a model was proposed for DNA binding that assumes that gene 2.5 binds ssDNA as a monomeric species (16Hollis T. Stattel J.M. Walther D.S. Richardson C.C. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9557-9562Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The hypothesis is that the negatively charged, acidic carboxyl terminus competes with the proposed DNA binding site of an adjacent protomer leading to the formation of dimers in the absence of ssDNA. Therefore dissolution of the dimer would be necessary to expose the DNA binding domain and allow for ssDNA binding. In support of this model we have shown how a carboxyl-terminal truncated form of the protein gp 2.5-Δ26C that exists as a monomer in solution (35Rezende L.F. Hollis T. Ellenberger T. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50643-50653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) has a 10-fold greater affinity for ssDNA as compared with wild-type gene 2.5 protein. Similar results have been seen with gp2.5-Δ21C, also a monomer in solution, where ssDNA binding was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. 4J. M. Stattel and C. C. Richardson, unpublished data. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay employed in this study provided an insight into the mode by which wild-type gene 2.5 protein binds ssDNA. Over a protein concentration series from 80 to 10,600 nm, upon binding a 70-mer oligonucleotide, two distinct protein·DNA complexes were resolved. Conceivably these two complexes could represent the binding of one monomer of gene 2.5 protein and a subsequent second monomer at a higher concentration. This interpretation is supported by the absence of the slower mobility complex when wild-type gene 2.5 protein binds to a shorter oligonucleotide of 38 bases in length as presumably only one monomer can be accommodated on this length. However, this hypothesis does not agree with the published site size for the protein, which is seven nucleotides per monomer (8Kim Y.T. Tabor S. Bortner C. Griffith J.D. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15022-15031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This site size was calculated by assessing the binding of gene 2.5 protein to circular M13 ssDNA. In a subsequent study using surface plasmon resonance, stable binding of gene 2.5 protein required an oligonucleotide of at least 30 nucleotides in length.4 Nonetheless this unexplained phenomenon presented by the distinct protein·DNA complexes warrants further study especially because other ssDNA-binding proteins have demonstrated different modes of binding ssDNA.As gene 2.5 protein has the capacity to mediate homologous DNA annealing2 we examined how efficiently the altered proteins could accomplish this activity. The altered proteins deficient in binding to ssDNA were also defective in annealing complimentary strands of ssDNA. However, we do observe some annealing at higher protein concentrations. For this reason, we feel the lack of annealing we observed is related to the affinity of the altered proteins for ssDNA rather than reflecting a defect in the basic mechanism of homologous base-pairing. Interestingly, gp2.5-Δ26C facilitates strand annealing more efficiently than the wild-type protein,3 further supporting a relationship between ssDNA binding affinity and homologous base pair annealing. Furthermore, despite its unaltered affinity for ssDNA the variant protein K109I is defective in base pairing, requiring 2-fold more protein to completely anneal all the substrate. We are currently pursuing the mechanism of this reaction by studying another altered protein that binds ssDNA but cannot facilitate the annealing of homologous strands of ssDNA.3 From the data presented here, we conclude that gp2.5 must be able to bind ssDNA to facilitate DNA annealing.All of the proteins described in this study were expressed from lethal mutations in gene 2.5. It is likely that gp2.5-K152E, gp2.5-Y158C, and gp2.5-Y111C/Y158C are lethal because they have a lower affinity for ssDNA. Given that ssDNA binding is an essential function for gene 2.5 it is not surprising that amino acid changes that reduce binding affinity in vitro are lethal in vivo. In addition, we have shown that these proteins can still form dimers, and physically interact with the T7 DNA polymerase and the 63-kDa gene 4 protein. The mechanism underlying gp2.5-K109I lethality, on the other hand, remains unclear. In cells harboring a plasmid encoding for this genetic alteration, we detected a reduced level DNA synthesis in vivo upon infection by T7Δ2.5 bacteriophage, 5E. M. Hyland, L. F. Rezende, and C. C. Richardson, unpublished data. suggesting that the function of this residue is important in the overall DNA replication of the bacteriophage. It is conceivable that both the impaired ability to facilitate annealing and the altered manner in which it binds ssDNA accounts for the in vivo phenotype. However, further investigation is necessary to probe the precise molecular basis of its involvement in the life cycle of bacteriophage T7. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)1-binding proteins lack sequence specificity and bind ssDNA with a higher affinity than they bind double-stranded DNA or RNA (1Chase J.W. Williams K.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 103-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Primarily, ssDNA-binding proteins function to bind any exposed regions of ssDNA in cells, forming a protective coat around the reactive bases and thus restricting the formation of secondary structures. However, their role is not restricted to extending and protecting DNA in that they also physically and functionally interact with other replication proteins. Bacteriophage T7 encodes its own ssDNA-binding protein, the product of gene 2.5. Gene 2.5 protein is essential for phage survival (2Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10173-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and plays multiple roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair (2Kim Y.T. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1971742114,"Neuronal Ca2+sensor protein-1 (NCS-1) is a member of the Ca2+ binding protein family, with three functional Ca2+ binding EF-hands and an N-terminal myristoylation site. NCS-1 is expressed in brain and heart during embryonic and postnatal development. In neurons, NCS-1 facilitates neurotransmitter release, but both inhibition and facilitation of the Ca2+ current amplitude have been reported. In heart, NCS-1 co-immunoprecipitates with K+channels and modulates their activity, but the potential effects of NCS-1 on cardiac Ca2+ channels have not been investigated. To directly assess the effect of NCS-1 on the various types of Ca2+ channels we have co-expressed NCS-1 inXenopus oocytes, with CaV1.2, CaV2.1, and CaV2.2 Ca2+ channels, using various subunit combinations. The major effect of NCS-1 was to decrease Ca2+ current amplitude, recorded with the three different types of α1 subunit. When expressed with CaV2.1, the depression of Ca2+ current amplitude induced by NCS-1 was dependent upon the identity of the β subunit expressed, with no block recorded without β subunit or with the β3 subunit. Current-voltage and inactivation curves were also slightly modified and displayed a different specificity toward the β subunits. Taken together, these data suggest that NCS-1 is able to modulate cardiac and neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in a β subunit specific manner.

Taken together, these data suggest that NCS-1 is able to modulate cardiac and neuronal voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in a β subunit specific manner. neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein-1 Ca2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is essential for various cellular processes that include muscle contraction, pacemaker activity, synaptic transmission, or gene expression. Several types of Ca2+channels have been characterized (T, L, N, P/Q, and R) that appear to play a specific role in each of these functions. These channels share a common architecture composed of a major α1 subunit (for which ten genes are known) tightly associated with regulatory subunits α2-δ (four different genes), β (four genes), and possibly γ (eight genes) in a functional multimeric complex (1Catterall W.A.

Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). This molecular diversity, further expanded by the existence of several splice variants for each of these genes, produces a large number of possible Ca2+ channel subunit combinations with different pharmacological and biophysical properties and specific cellular and subcellular localization (5Felix R. Receptors. Channels. 1999; 6: 351-362PubMed Google Scholar). The precise regulation of the Ca2+ influx in response to various physiological situations is further controlled by several regulatory mechanisms, working at different levels, including channel expression, localization, or activity, via additional interactions with modulatory proteins. Several Ca2+-dependent feedback mechanisms sense incoming Ca2+ ions to finely tune channel activity to the cellular Ca2+ demands and prevent cytotoxic Ca2+ overload (6Budde T. Meuth S. Pape H.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 873-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). These mechanisms use Ca2+-sensing proteins and are specific of a given type of Ca2+ channel. It has been shown, for example, that Ca2+-dependent inactivation of the L-type Ca2+ channel (encoded by the CaV1.2 α1 subunit) is governed by a Ca2+-driven interaction between calmodulin and the C-terminal tail of the channel α1 subunit (7Peterson B.Z.

A similar functional interaction also appears to exist on the P/Q-type Ca2+ channel (encoded by the CaV2.1 subunit), the major channel type involved in synaptic transmission in the mammalian central nervous system (11Lee A.

The neuronal Ca2+ sensor protein-1 (NCS-1),1 the mammalian homologue of frequenin, belongs to a group of small Ca2+-binding proteins comprising four EF-hand motifs, three of which are able to bind Ca2+ in the micromolar (EF-2) or submicromolar (EF-3,4) range (14Olafsson P.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2427-2433Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), leading to the hypothesis that part of the effects mediated by NCS-1 could involve modifications in cellular trafficking through regulation of the phosphatidylinositol signaling pathway, thereby affecting vesicular transport and recycling, as well as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ stores (24Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A. Toth Z.E. Oker-Blom C. Roder J. Jeromin A. Balla T. J. Biol.

Overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of NCS-1, which displays impaired Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (19Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), or direct loading of presynaptic nerve terminals with NCS-1 suggested that voltage-independent inhibition, as well as activity-dependent facilitation of P/Q-type Ca2+ channels (CaV2.1), could be controlled by NCS-1, possibly via direct protein-protein interactions (18Tsujimoto T. Jeromin A. Saitoh N. Roder J.C. Takahashi T. Science. 2002; 295: 2276-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Effects on N-type Ca2+ channel (CaV2.2) properties have also been reported (20Wang C.Y. Yang F. He X. Chow A. Du J. Russell J.T. Lu B. Neuron. 2001; 32: 99-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and the expression of NCS-1 in mammalian cardiac myocytes and subsequent effect on K+ channel expression (26Guo W. Malin S.A. Johns D.C. Jeromin A. Nerbonne J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26436-26443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) gave rise to the possibility that NCS-1 may regulate multiple types of Ca2+ channels and other voltage-dependent ion channels, not only in neurons (27Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. Trends Neurosci. 2002; 25: 489-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a first step to explore this possibility, we have co-expressed NCS-1 with three different types of Ca2+ channel, CaV1.2, CaV2.1, and CaV2.2, associated with different combinations of auxiliary β subunit, and measured the resulting Ba2+ and Ca2+ currents. These combinations are likely to be expressed in different cell types where they represent potential targets for NCS-1 effects. Our goal was to explore the effect of NCS-1 on both Ca2+ channel expression and properties and to provide a first description of the molecular requirements necessary for NCS-1 effects on Ca2+channel that may help in the understanding of the precise mode of action of this Ca2+-binding protein. We have, however, focused this study on the P/Q-type (CaV2.1) Ca2+ channels, which seem to be a primary target in various cell types (28Weiss J.L. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44804-44811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Our results show that NCS-1 down-regulates expression of L-, N-, and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels in a β subunit-specific manner and induces minor modifications of the electrophysiological properties of the channel. We provide evidence of direct functional effects of NCS-1, in addition to modifications in the expression level and/or trafficking of the channels to the membrane. The following cDNA were used, and the GenBankTM accession number is provided: CaV1.2 (α1C), M67515; CaV2.1 (α1A), M64373; CaV2.2 (α1B),D14157; NCS-1, L27421; β1b, X61394; β2a,M80545; β3, M88751; β4, L02315; and α2-δ1, M86621. Mutations NCS-1E120Q and NCS-1G2A have been described previously (29O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14227-14237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ca2+ channel subunits were subcloned into the pmt2 vector, whereas NCS-1 and its mutants were subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). Xenopus laevis oocyte preparation and injection were performed as described previously (30Cens T. Mangoni M.E. Richard S. Nargeot J. Charnet P. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 771-774PubMed Google Scholar). Each oocyte was injected with 5–10 nl of a cDNA mixture containing the α1+α2δ+β+NCS-1 cDNAs at ∼0.3 ng/nl with a ratio of 1:2:3:1. When one or more of these cDNAs was omitted, cDNA concentrations were kept constant by addition of the appropriate volume of deionized water. Oocytes were kept for 2 to 4 days before recordings at 18 °C and under gentle agitation. Whole-cell Ba2+ currents were recorded under two-electrode voltage clamp using the GeneClamp 500 amplifier (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Current and voltage electrodes (less than 1 megohm) were filled with 3 m KCl, pH 7.2, with KOH. Ba2+ and Ca2+ current recordings were performed after injection of BAPTA (∼50 nl of the following (in mm): BAPTA-free acid (Sigma), 100; CsOH, 10; HEPES, 10; pH 7.2 with CsOH) using the following bathing solution (in mm): BaOH/CaOH, 10; TEAOH, 20; NMDG, 50; CsOH, 2; HEPES, 10; pH 7.2, with methanesulfonic acid. Currents were filtered and digitized using a DMA-Tecmar Labmaster and subsequently stored on a Pentium-based personal computer using the pClamp software (version 6.02; Axon Instruments). Ba2+ or Ca2+currents were recorded during a 400-ms test pulse from −80 to +10 mV. Current amplitudes were measured at the peak of the current. Comparisons of averaged amplitudes between batches were always made with amplitudes measured the same day after injection. Comparisons between similar experiments were made by normalizing all averaged amplitudes with respect to the control current amplitude set as 100%. Isochronal steady-state inactivation curves (2.5 s of conditioning voltage followed by a 400-ms test pulse to +10 mV) were fitted using the equation, I/I max =R in + (1 − R in)/(1 + exp((V − V in)/k)), where I is the current amplitude measured during the test pulse at +10 mV for conditioning voltages varying from −80 to +50 mV,I max is the current amplitude measured during the test pulse for a conditioning voltage to −80 mV,V in is the potential for half-inactivation,V is the voltage, k is the slope factor, andR in is the proportion of non-inactivating current. Current to voltage curves were fitted using the equation,I/I max =G*(V − E rev)/(1 + exp((V − V act)/k)), where I is the current amplitude measured during voltage steps varying from −80 to +50 mV, I max is the peak current amplitude measured at the minimum of the current-voltage curve, G is the normalized macroscopic conductance,E rev is the apparent reversal potential,V act is the potential for half-activation,V is the value of the voltage step, and k is a slope factor. Inactivation kinetics were estimated by fitting Ba2+current decay with two exponential components using the equation,I(t) =A 1e(−t/τ1) +A 2e(−t/τ2) + C, whereI is the current amplitude, t is the time, τ1, τ2, A 1, andA 2 represent the time constants and amplitudes of the two components, and C is a constant. The proportion of the slow time constant (%τ2) is the ratioA 2/(A 1+A 2). Several independent experiments (N, number of batches of oocytes injected) were performed, always including a control group without NCS-1 expressed. These experiments always gave the same statistical result, and the total number of recordings (fromn oocytes of these N experiments) are thus presented. All values are presented as mean ± S.E., and comparison between groups of oocytes were evaluated using a Student'st test, with a statistical significance set at thep value <0.05. Selected oocytes were first homogenized in the lysis buffer (5 μl/oocyte of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 5 mmNa4P2O7) and centrifuged at 4 °C and 14000 rpm for 5 min. The upper aqueous phase was collected and subjected to 10% (see Fig. 2 C) or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (loaded with ∼3 oocytes/lane). Proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters. For immunological detection, the blots were first blocked for 1 h with 8% non-fat milk powder in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20), incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-NCS-1 (Zymol at 1/1000 dilution in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBST) or anti-CaV2.1 antibodies (Alomone Laboratories Jerusalem, Israel), and after five washes, incubated with an anti-rabbit antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; 1/10000 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.8% nonfat milk powder in TBST). Correct expression of NCS-1 was always checked after electrophysiological recordings. Previous works on chromaffin, human embryonic kidney 293, and COS-7 cells have shown that NCS-1 was endogenously expressed at non-negligible levels (24Zhao X. Varnai P. Tuymetova G. Balla A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44804-44811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 2A. Jeromin, unpublished observations. In non-injectedX. laevis oocytes, the level of expression of the endogenous NCS-1 was barely detectable in Western-blots and much lower than in human embryonic kidney 293 and COS-7 cells (see Fig. 1 A). Thus X. laevis oocytes are a system of choice to study the functional effect of NCS-1 on voltage-gated Ca2+channels. In these oocytes, injection of the cDNA coding for rat NCS-1 led, as expected, to a massive expression of a protein of a molecular mass of ∼23 kDa, in accordance with the theoretical molecular mass of NCS-1 (21.9 kDa; see Fig. 1 B). In the following experiments, the oocytes used for current recordings were collected after recordings and submitted to a similar Western blot analysis to ensure that the NCS-1 protein was properly expressed. In a first set of experiments, the effects of NCS-1 were tested on Ba2+currents flowing through L-, N-, and P/Q-type Ca2+channels. For each Ca2+ channel type, this was done by co-injecting a mixture of cDNA containing β2, α2-δ, and the appropriate α1Ca2+ channel subunits (CaV1.2, CaV2.2, or CaV2.1, respectively) with either NCS-1 cDNA or water into two different batches of oocytes. After 2 to 4 days of incubation, Ba2+ current amplitudes were recorded from the two batches of oocytes injected the same day, during a single 400-ms-long depolarizing step to +10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV and compared. Under these conditions, a clear decrease in the averaged Ba2+ current amplitude was seen upon co-expression of NCS-1 (see Fig.2 A). This effect was most pronounced in oocytes expressing the CaV2.2 Ca2+ channel, where the averaged Ba2+ current amplitude recorded in the batch of oocytes co-injected with rat NCS-1 cDNA (N = 1 experiment, n = 38 oocytes) was only 10% of the control current amplitude recorded from oocytes co-injected with H2O instead of the NCS-1 cDNA (N = 1, n = 35). However, a similar effect was also found when NCS-1 was co-injected with CaV1.2 (N = 3, n = 71; 52% of the control amplitude n = 70) or CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel subunits (N = 7,n = 206; 46% of the control amplituden = 162). The Ca2+ channel β subunit is an important determinant of the final Ca2+ current amplitude observed at the oocyte surface membrane and regulates many of its electrophysiological properties (4Birnbaumer L. Qin N. Olcese R. Tareilus E. Platano D. Costantin J. Stefani E. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1998; 30: 357-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 31Perez-Reyes E. Castellano A. Kim H.S.

Dascal N. Science. 1991; 253: 1553-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Hence, we tested the role of the β subunit on the effects of NCS-1. Using the same experimental approach, we co-expressed NCS-1 with the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel either with the α2-δ subunit alone or with the α2-δ and one of the four β subunits (β1-β4). Again, in each case, the resulting current amplitude was compared with the current amplitude recorded in oocytes injected with the same combination of Ca2+ channel subunits but without NCS-1. Interestingly, when NCS-1 was co-expressed with CaV2.1 without β subunit, almost no effect on current amplitude was observed (N = 2,n = 32 and 26 for control). A similar result was also found upon co-expression of the β3 subunit (N = 12, n = 198, with controln = 198), whereas co-expression of NCS-1 with the CaV2.1 and β1, β2, or β4 subunit decreased the expressed Ba2+current amplitude to between 25 and 45% of their respective control values (see Fig. 2 B, N = 3, 7, 2 andn = 100, 206, 71 and n = 65, 162, 84 for controls, respectively). The lack of effect of NCS-1 on the CaV2.1 Ca2+ channel subunit, expressed alone or with the β3 subunit, could not be attributed to a deficit of NCS-1 protein in these oocytes, because a robust expression of NCS-1 was also detected in these oocytes by Western blot (seebottom of Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, to ensure that the decrease of the Ba2+ current amplitude obtained upon co-expression of NCS-1 with the β1, β2, or β4 subunit was not because of a deleterious effect on the expression of any cloned protein, we analyzed the level of expression of the CaV2.1 protein in these conditions by Western blot. Fig. 2 C demonstrates that a clear band of an approximate molecular mass of 250 kDa, matching of the theoretical molecular mass of the CaV2.1 subunit (251 kDa), could be specifically detected only in oocytes injected with the CaV2.1 subunit cDNA (+α2-δ+β2 subunits; see Fig.2 C, left lane). In oocytes co-injected with NCS-1 cDNA and the same combinations of Ca2+ channel subunits, this CaV2.1 immunoreactive band was also present at similar intensity (Fig. 2 C, middle lane, eachlane approximately loaded with three oocytes), whereas it was absent in non-injected oocytes (Fig. 2 C, right lane). These results therefore revealed a true, β subunit-specific effect of NCS-1 on the Ba2+ current amplitude that cannot be attributed to nonspecific down-regulation of protein expression. We next investigated whether co-expression of NCS-1 with the CaV2.1 subunit might have other functional consequences on Ca2+channel properties. Current-voltage curves and isochronal inactivation curves were constructed from currents recorded in oocytes expressing the CaV2.1 subunit with the α2-δ alone or with the β1, β2, or β3subunits, in the presence or absence of NCS-1. These recordings were performed using either Ba2+ or Ca2+ ions as extracellular permeant cations to track any Ca2+-specific modulation. As presented in Table I, in the presence of Ca2+ ions and in the absence of β subunit (α1A+α2-δ subunits), no modifications in the activation and inactivation parameters were observed upon co-expression of NCS-1. This lack of effect was also noted upon co-expression of the β1 or β3subunit (see Fig. 3 and Table I). Interestingly, when co-expressed with CaV2.1 and the β2a subunit, NCS-1 significantly depolarized the current-voltage curve (V act = −5.0 and −0.8 mV without and with NCS-1 respectively, p < 0.05) and reduced inactivation (R in = 69 and 56% respectively, p < 0.05). Similar effects were also found in the presence of extracellular Ba2+ (TableII) and thus were not Ca2+-dependent.Table IEffects of NCS-1 on Cav2.1 Ca2+ currentsCa2+currentsV actK actV inK inR inmV%α1A + α2 − δ (n = 3)17.1 ± 5.0−8.2 ± 1.7−7.1 ± 1.39.5 ± 2.00 ± 14α1A + α2 − δ + NCS-1 (n = 4)20.5 ± 5.4−13.3 ± 2.5−4.3 ± 1.710.7 ± 1.70 ± 3.5α1A + α2 − δ + β1 (n = 8)0.6 ± 1.1−4.6 ± 0.2−18.3 ± 0.45.5 ± 0.210 ± 1.0α1A + α2 − δ + β1 + NCS-1 (n = 8)−0.5 ± 1.0−4.9 ± 0.5−17.3 ± 0.75.7 ± 0.315 ± 3.2α1A + α2 − δ + β2 (n = 8)−5.1 ± 1.1−3.6 ± 0.5−6.1 ± 0.54.3 ± 1.169 ± 2.9α1A + α2 − δ + β2 + NCS-1 (n = 10)−0.8 ± 1.0aStatistically different from control without NCS-1 expressed (0.05 level).−4.1 ± 0.7−3.8 ± 1.35.5 ± 0.856 ± 3.9aStatistically different from control without NCS-1 expressed (0.05 level).α1A + α2 − δ + β3 (n = 7)1.3 ± 1.0−4.6 ± 0.4−17.3 ± 0.65.4 ± 0.36 ± 1.7α1A + α2 − δ + β3 + NCS-1 (n = 5)2.9 ± 0.7−4.9 ± 0.2−17.6 ± 1.15.6 ± 0.36 ± 2.1Current-voltage and inactivation curve parameters calculated from oocytes expressing the indicated combination of subunits, in the presence of 10 mm external Ca2+.

Current-voltage and inactivation curve parameters calculated from oocytes expressing the indicated combination of subunits, in the presence of 10 mm external Ba2+. See “Experimental Procedures” for details. We then analyzed the effects of NCS-1 on Ba2+ current kinetics. CaV2.1 current inactivation could be approximated by an exponential decaying phase, best described using a fast (τ1) and a slow (τ2) component. None of these components appeared to be significantly affected by expression of the Ca2+-binding protein NCS-1 (Fig.4). This lack of effect was found for channels co-expressed with the β1 or the β2subunit and in the presence of either extracellular Ba2+ or Ca2+. Neither the time constants (τ1 and τ2) nor their respective amplitude (%τ2) were changed at all voltages examined (see Fig. 4). Moreover, no effect on channel activation and reactivation were observed upon co-expression of NCS-1, whether the CaV2.1 subunit was expressed with the α2-δ alone or with any of the four β subunits (not shown). Therefore, although both channel expression and channel properties seemed to be regulated by NCS-1 in a β subunit-specific manner, they appear to require different subunit arrangements,i.e. expression was modified when β1, β2, or β4 subunits were expressed, whereas modifications in channel properties were only recorded in the presence of the β2 subunit. To get some insight into the possible molecular determinants involved in NCS-1 effects, the same experiments, with the β2asubunit, were conducted using two mutants of NCS-1. NCS-1E120Q, with its third EF-hand disrupted, showed impaired Ca2+-dependent conformational changes (19Weiss J.L. Archer D.A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40082-40087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) but was still able to bind cellular proteins. NCS-1G2A, a myristoylation-deficient mutant of NCS-1, relocalized NCS-1 from the perinuclear region to the cytosol (29O'Callaghan D.W. Ivings L. Weiss J.L. Ashby M.C. Tepikin A.V. Burgoyne R.D. J.

Co-expression of either NCS-1E120Q or NCS-1G2Ahad the same effect as wild-type NCS-1 on the current-voltage curve of the CaV2.1+α2-δ+β2Ca2+ channel (i.e. a small but significant positive shift of ∼5 mV; see Fig. 5B and Table III). They differed, however, in their effects on the inactivation curve. Although the NCS-1E120Q completely suppressed the effect of NCS-1 on the residual current (R in; see Fig. 5 and TableIII), co-expression of NCS-1G2A left this parameter unchanged but suppressed the shift in V ininduced by wild-type NCS-1. These two mutants also had different actions on current amplitudes. Indeed, whereas NCS-1E120Qreduced the Ba2+ current amplitude when compared with control currents, recorde"

One such mutation, deletion of phenylalanine 1388 (ΔPhe-1388), leads to defects in both trafficking and MgADP response of KATP channels. Here we investigated the biochemical features of Phe-1388 that control the proper trafficking and function of KATP channels by substituting the residue with all other 19 amino acids. Whereas surface expression is largely dependent on hydrophobicity, channel response to MgADP is governed by multiple factors and involves the detailed architecture of the amino acid side chain. Thus, structural features in SUR1 required for proper channel function are distinct from those required for correct protein trafficking. Remarkably, replacing Phe-1388 by leucine profoundly alters the physiological and pharmacological properties of the channel. The F1388L-SUR1 channel has increased sensitivity to MgADP and metabolic inhibition, decreased sensitivity to glibenclamide, and responds to both diazoxide and pinacidil.

SURs belong to the ATPBinding Cassette family of membrane proteins (ABC transporters); each SUR molecule contains two of the nucleotide binding domains (NBD) that are highly conserved in all ABC transporters. Biochemical evidence suggests that hydrolysis of MgATP at NBD2 stabilizes binding of ATP at NBD1 and thereby facilitates functional coupling between SUR1 and Kir6.2 and channel activation (18Ueda K.

Because the stimulatory effect of ADP requires Mg2+ and hydrolyzable nucleotides, we will refer to the effect as the MgADP response. In the pancreas, KATP channels regulate insulin secretion in response to changes in blood glucose levels. Loss of functional KATP channels as a result of genetic mutations is a major cause of familial hyperinsulinism, a disease characterized by excessive insulin secretion and severe hypoglycemia (21Huopio H.

In many cases, mutations in SUR1 or Kir6.2 attenuate or abolish KATPchannel function by causing protein truncations or by affecting the ability of the channel to respond to MgADP (11Nichols C.G.

Recently, defective trafficking of KATP channels has emerged as another important mechanism underlying the disease (24Partridge C.J. Beech D.J. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol.

Under normal conditions, trafficking of KATP channel complexes out of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is controlled by a tripeptide Arg-Lys-Arg (RKR) retention/retrieval signal present in each of the SUR and Kir6.2 subunits (28Zerangue N. Schwappach B. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1999; 22: 537-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Upon successful assembly of SUR and Kir into an octameric complex, the -RKR- motifs are concealed to allow the channel to translocate from the ER to the Golgi, where the sugar moiety on SUR is modified before further translocation to the plasma membrane (3Clement J.P.T.

Thus, the -RKR- trafficking signal provides a quality control mechanism to prevent individual subunits as well as incompletely assembled channel complexes from trafficking to the cell surface. One mutation that we have reported previously to cause defective channel trafficking is the deletion of phenylalanine at position 1388 of SUR1 (ΔPhe-1388). The ΔPhe-1388-SUR1 mutant channels were retained in the ER, unable to reach the cell surface (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, a small percentage of them could escape to the cell surface when the RKR retention signal in SUR1 was inactivated by mutation (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The mutant channels thus expressed on the cell surface showed no response to MgADP and therefore would not be able to respond to metabolic changes. These observations indicate that Phe-1388 of SUR1 is critical for both correct trafficking and function of KATP channels. In the present study, we investigated the biochemical properties of the phenylalanine residue that are important in each aspect of channel regulation by substituting Phe-1388 in SUR1 with other amino acids (collectively referred to as F1388X-SUR1 mutants). We show that the substitutions have differential effects on channel trafficking and channel response to MgADP (hence channel function). Whereas hydrophobicity determines the efficiency of channel trafficking, the detailed architecture of the amino acid side chain appears to be important in ensuring proper channel response to MgADP. Importantly, replacing Phe-1388 by leucine dramatically potentiated channel response to MgADP. Such a “gain of MgADP response” phenotype may be exploited for therapeutic purposes in managing insulin secretion. Moreover, F1388L-SUR1 mutant channels exhibit reduced sensitivities to glibenclamide and are stimulated by both diazoxide and pinacidil, properties resembling the SUR2B/Kir6.2 channels found in vascular smooth muscle (8Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 17Isomoto S. Kurachi Y.J. J. Cardiovasc.

Sci. 2000; 21: 439-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate the role that the 1388 residue of SUR1 plays in modulating the physiological and pharmacological properties of KATP channels. Because the SUR1-Phe-1388 equivalent position in SUR2A and SUR2B is occupied by a leucine, our results also suggest that the conservative change between phenylalanine and leucine may serve as a mechanism for generating functional diversity in KATP channels. Point mutations of SUR1 were introduced into hamster FLAG-SUR1 cDNA in the pECE plasmid using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as described previously (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Epitope tag and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All SUR1 constructs are in the pECE vector and mouse Kir6.2 cDNA in the pCMV6b vector (a gift from Dr. S. Seino). In immunoblotting experiments, a rat Kir6.2 in pCDNA3 (a gift from Dr. C. Vandenberg) was used for cotransfection. Mutant clones from multiple PCRs were analyzed in all experiments to avoid false results caused by undesired mutations introduced by PCR. In some cases, an additional subcloning step (a restriction fragment of NotI andEcoRI corresponding to nucleotide positions 4135–4858 of the plasmid) was used to minimize potential PCR-introduced artifacts. Surface expression of channels was quantified as described previously (27Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). COSm6 cells plated in 35-mm dishes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, 48–72 h after transfection. Fixed cells were pre-blocked in PBS + 0.1% BSA for 30 min or overnight, incubated in M2 anti-FLAG antibody (10 μg/ml) for an hour, washed 4 times for 30 min in PBS + 0.1% BSA, incubated in horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (The Jackson Laboratories, 1:1000 dilution) for 20 min, washed again 4 times for 30 min in PBS + 0.1% BSA, and 2 times for 5 min in PBS. Chemiluminescence signal of each dish was quantified in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs) following 15 s of incubation in Power Signal Elisa luminol solution (Pierce). All steps after fixation were carried out at room temperature. Results of each experiment are the average of duplicate or triplicate dishes. For each mutant, 3–10 independent experiments were performed (see Fig. 1). Immunoblotting analyses were performed using COS-1 instead of COSm6 cells to avoid high background (27Taschenberger G.

Although both gave qualitatively similar results, the rat Kir6.2 in pCDNA3 consistently yielded better expression of Kir6.2 than mouse Kir6.2 in pCMV6b when transfected in COS-1 cells; we therefore used rat Kir6.2 for immunoblotting experiments shown in Fig. 2. Cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 0.6 μg of SUR1 and 0.4 μg of rat Kir6.2 per dish using FuGENE. Cells were lysed 48–72 h later in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 with CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Proteins in cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE (8%), transferred to nitrocellulose, analyzed by incubation with the M2 anti-FLAG antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (AmershamBiosciences), and visualized by chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Femto; Pierce). COSm6 cells were transfected using FuGENE and plated onto coverslips. The cDNA for the green fluorescent protein was cotransfected with SUR1 and Kir6.2 to facilitate identification of positively transfected cells. Patch clamp recordings were made 36–72 h post-transfection. All experiments were performed at room temperature as described previously (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc.

Electrode resistance was typically 0.5–1 megohms when filled with K-INT solution (below). Inside-out patches were voltage-clamped with an Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Inc., Foster City, CA). The standard bath (intracellular) and pipette (extracellular) solution (K-INT) had the following composition: 140 mm KCl, 10 mmK-Hepes, 1 mm K-EGTA, pH 7.3. In experiments shown in Fig.5 A and the inset of Fig. 5 B(dose-response curve to ATP and ADP), 1 mm EDTA was added to K-INT to chelate residual Mg2+; inclusion of EDTA in the K-INT solution significantly reduced channel rundown, making quantification of channel activities more reliable. All currents were measured at a membrane potential of −50 mV (pipette voltage = +50 mV). Data were analyzed using pCLAMP software (Axon Instrument). Off-line analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel programs. Data were presented as means ± S.E. in most cases wheren ≥ 3 patches; in one case where n = 2 patches (F1388D-SUR1 mutant in Fig. 4), the value represents the mean ± the difference between the individual value and the mean.Figure 4Quantitation of the MgADP response. The MgADP response of a mutant channel was first calculated as the maximal currents obtained in K-INT solution containing 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm ADP, and 1 mm free Mg2+, relative to that in K-INT. This value was then expressed as a fraction of that obtained from WT channels. With the exception of F1388D, the values in the bar graph represent the average of 3–12 patches, with error bars representing the S.E. of the mean. For the F1388D mutant channel, the mean value is the average of 2 patches, with the error bar showing the difference between the individual values and the average. Note the differential effects of amino acid substitutions on surface expression (Fig. 1) and MgADP response.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cells were incubated for 24 h in culture medium containing 86RbCl (1 μCi/ml) 2–3 days after transfection. Before measurement of Rb+ efflux, cells were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in Krebs-Ringer solution, with different metabolic inhibitors (0.5–1 mm 2-deoxy-d-glucose, 2.5 μg/ml oligomycin, or a combination of both). At selected time points, the solution was aspirated from the cells and replaced with fresh solution. At the end of a 40-min period, cells were lysed in Ringer's solution containing 2% SDS. The 86Rb+ in the aspirated solution and the cell lysates was counted. The percentage efflux at each time point was calculated as the cumulative counts in the aspirated solution divided by the total counts from the solutions and the cell lysates. Deletion of Phe-1388 of SUR1 causes failure of KATP channels to express on the cell surface. To examine which chemical features of the phenylalanine residue are critical for proper trafficking of the channel, we substituted Phe-1388 in SUR1 with all other 19 amino acids and determined how the substitutions affected surface expression of KATP channels. For all F1388X-SUR1 mutant constructs, a FLAG epitope tag was added to the N terminus to allow surface labeling of the protein. Each mutant SUR1 construct was cotransfected with wild-type (WT) Kir6.2 into COS cells, and surface expression of KATP channels was quantified by a chemiluminescence assay (27Taschenberger G. Mougey A. Shen S. Lester L.B. LaFranchi S. Shyng S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17139-17146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Results from chemiluminescence assays were further confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopy of surface-labeled FLAG-SUR1 (not shown). Based on surface expression levels, the mutants can be classified into two groups: those that give rise to expression levels above 50% that of the WT, and those that give rise to levels below 50% that of the WT (Fig.1). Amino acids in the first group include Phe, Cys, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, Met, and Trp; these amino acids are in general considered hydrophobic. By contrast, amino acids with polar and charged side chains dramatically reduced surface expression of the channel. SUR1 protein that is expressed on the cell surface has traversed the Golgi apparatus where it becomes complex-glycosylated; this complex-glycosylated SUR1 has lower mobility than the core-glycosylated form on the SDS-PAGE and is referred to as the “upper band” (26Cartier E.A.

We examined the glycosylation pattern of F1388X-SUR1 mutants in cells coexpressing Kir6.2 by Western blots. All of the mutants in the first group of Fig. 1 (Cys, Ile, Leu, Met, Val, Ala, and Trp) have an upper band that corresponds to the complex-glycosylated form, similar to the WT protein. On the other hand, all of the mutants in the second group of Fig. 1 have none or have a barely detectable (when overexposed, not shown) upper band. These results are consistent with surface expression results obtained by the chemiluminescence assay. Previous work (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) has found that the ΔPhe-1388 mutation abolished surface expression of KATPchannels without significantly altering the steady-state SUR1 protein levels. We found that the steady-state total protein levels of F1388X-SUR1 mutants (the sum of the upper and the lower bands) in the first group are largely unaltered compared with the WT SUR1 (upper two panels of Fig.2). However, mutants in the second group in general exhibited lower protein levels (lower two panelsof Fig. 2), in particular, when Phe-1388 was substituted by Pro or Ser (marked with asterisks in Fig. 2). Similar results were obtained in cells expressing SUR1 mutant protein alone (not shown). Earlier studies have demonstrated that a small percentage of the ΔPhe-1388-SUR1 mutant channels retained in the ER could escape to the cell surface when the −RKR- ER retention/retrieval motif in SUR1 was inactivated by mutation to AAA (26Cartier E.A. Conti L.R. Vandenberg C.A. Shyng S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2882-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, unlike the WT channels, the ΔPhe-1388RKR→AAA-SUR1 channels expressed on the cell surface failed to respond to MgADP. The data presented above demonstrate that hydrophobicity of the amino acid at SUR1 position 1388 is a critical parameter in determining the ability of the channel to exit ER and express on the cell surface. To test if the same parameter governs channel response to MgADP, we performed inside-out patch clamp recordings of the F1388X-SUR1 mutant channels. Of the mutants that had poor surface expression, we managed to obtain a few patches from the F1388T, F1388Y, F1388P, F1388S (n = 3–5), and F1388D (n = 2) mutants. No patches containing detectable currents were obtained for the F1388G, F1388E, F1388H, F1388K, F1388N, F1388Q, and F1388R mutants. Typical current traces from the WT and the mutant channels are shown in Fig.3. The MgADP response was quantified as the current in a solution containing 0.1 mm ATP, 0.5 mm ADP, and 1 mm free Mg2+, relative to the current in the absence of any nucleotides. This response in mutant channels was further normalized to the response obtained in WT channels and is shown in Fig.4. Comparing Fig. 4 (MgADP response) to Fig. 1 (cell surface expression), it becomes immediately clear that the chemical properties of the amino acid at the SUR1 1388 site governing channel expression are distinct from those governing channel response to MgADP. Many of the amino acid substitutions that are tolerated for surface expression have very poor response to MgADP (for example, F1388C, F1388V, and F1388I), and vice versa, some of the amino acid substitutions that render poor surface expression of the channel still retain the ability to respond to MgADP (for example, F1388T and F1388S). Remarkably, the leucine and isoleucine substitutions, although both resulted in efficient channel expression, differed dramatically in their response to MgADP. Whereas leucine potentiated channel response to MgADP by nearly 1.7-fold (Fig.4), isoleucine almost abolished channel response to MgADP (Figs. 3 and4). The two amino acids have the exact same chemical compositions and similar physical chemical properties; the only difference between them is the architecture of the side chain. Therefore, the parameters required for conferring MgADP response appear to involve detailed side chain structures and not just hydrophobicity. The observation that the F1388L-SUR1 mutant channels are better stimulated by MgADP prompted us to characterize these channels in greater detail. Sequence comparison between SUR1 and SUR2A and -2B reveals that the SUR1-Phe-1388 equivalent residue in SUR2A and -2B is a leucine (10Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Wang C.Z. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Seino S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1011-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). SUR1, SUR2A, and SUR2B, when combined with Kir6.2, form the pancreatic, cardiac, and vascular smooth muscle subtypes of KATPchannels, respectively. These KATP channel subtypes display different sensitivities to ATP, MgADP, sulfonylureas, and potassium channel openers (8Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev.

The SUR1/Kir6.2 recombinant channels have high sensitivities to inhibition by ATP (K i∼10 μm) and glibenclamide (K i <10 nm) and are stimulated only by the KCO diazoxide. Channels containing the SUR2 isoforms, on the other hand, have lower sensitivities to ATP and glibenclamide but are stimulated by potassium channel openers other than diazoxide, such as pinacidil and cromakalim (8Babenko A.P.

Their appearance is, in many cases, related to a key role of the sulfhydryl group on the structural and functional features of the protein. These side chains have the capacity to actively participate in catalysis, can be posttranslationally modified, or can lead to the apparition of redox sensitive sites that could have effects either on modulation of catalysis or because of the generation of conformational restrictions (1Cappel R.E.

Posttranslational modifications, such as prenylation and acylation, take place in the sulfhydryl group of cysteine residues located at or near the C terminus of the protein, leading to translocation from the cytosol to membranes (4Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar, 5Nalivaeva N.N. Turner A.J. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 735-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Nitrosylation occurs in residues related to activity control, either activating (ryanodine receptor) or inactivating key proteins (MAT)1 (6Stamler J.S. Lamas S. Fang F.C. Cell. 2001; 106: 675-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Zinc chelation determines the acquisition of polypeptide geometries compatible with the recognition of nucleic acids (zinc fingers) (7Laity J.H. Lee B.M. Wright P.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of cysteine sulfhydryl groups may also play an essential role in folding and association, because of disulfide bond formation (8Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 107: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 9Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To form this covalent bond, the residues must come to a distance such that the Cα atoms of the cysteines are within 3.8–4.5 Å of each other (9Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 83-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These disulfides can be established within the same subunit, linking different areas of the polypeptide chain that may be quite distant in the sequence, or between subunits, binding each monomer on the right position to the others (10Silva C.M. Cidlowsky J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6638-6647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hardy S.J. Holmgren J. Johansson S. Sánchez J. Hirst T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7109-7113Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The production and stability of disulfides have been related to the existence of an oxidative environment. Thus, the number of extracellular or secreted proteins that contain disulfide bridges in their structure is large, because of their passage through a highly oxidative environment, such as that of the endoplasmic reticulum, where the presence of thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases favors their production (12Price N.C. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1994: 160-193Google Scholar). However, in vitro experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to obtain disulfide bonds even under strong reducing conditions, provided the local concentration of sulfhydryls is high enough (13Gilbert H.F. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. IRL Press, Oxford, UK1994: 104-136Google Scholar). Therefore, the presence of disulfides in cytosolic proteins is possible, and in fact, there have been some reports describing their existence (14Davoodi J. Drown P.M. Bledsoe R.K. Wallin R. Reinhart G.D. Hutson S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4982-4989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 15Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Pajares M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The role for these covalent bonds is not clear and may be related to the control of protein activity. One of the few cases where the presence of a cytosolic disulfide has been described is the liver-specific methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT), a homo-oligomeric protein that is isolated as stable tetramers (MAT I) and dimers (MAT III), differing in the affinity for methionine (16Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Ortiz P. Pajares M.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 73: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). MAT I is 10-fold more active than MAT III under physiological concentrations of the amino acid (60 μm) (17Cabrero C. Puerta J.L. Alemany S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and hence the ratio of isoforms determine the activity level displayed in the cell. This is of special relevance if we take into account that the product of MAT reaction is S-adenosylmethionine, the main methyl donor for the transmethylation reactions (18Cantoni G.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1975; 44: 435-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). This enzyme presents 10 cysteine residues/subunit (19Horikawa S. Ishikawa M. Ozasa H. Tsukada K. Eur. J.

FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and under severalin vitro and in vivo conditions it has been possible to demonstrate their role on the activity and oligomeric state: (a) inactivation and dissociation of MAT I is produced by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) modification of two −SH groups (21Corrales F.

Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); (c) all of the mutants on the cysteines comprised between residues 35 and 105 have some effect on the MAT I/MAT III ratio (23Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sánchez-Góngora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar); (d) the enzyme activity is inhibited by GSSG (2Pajares M.A. Durán C. Corrales F. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and nitrosylation of Cys121 (24Avila M.A. Mingorance J. Martı́nez-Chantar M.L.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); (e) inhibition of the glutathione synthesis leading to a 30% reduction in the GSH levels, and hence to the alteration of the GSH/GSSG ratio, correlates with a decrease in MAT activity (26Corrales F. Ochoa P. Rivas C. Martı́n-Lomas M. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Hepatology. 1991; 14: 528-533PubMed Google Scholar); and (f) low MAT activity and mainly dimers are detectable under the oxidative conditions of alcohol liver cirrhosis (27Cabrero C. Martı́n-Duce A. Ortiz P. Alemany S. Mato J.M. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 1530-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Moreover, a disulfide bond between Cys35 and Cys61 that are located in the β-sheet of contact between dimers, according to the crystal structure, has been identified (15Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Pajares M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28González B. Pajares M.A. Hermoso J. Alvarez L. Garrido F. Sufrin J.R. Sanz-Aparicio J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 363-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This disulfide was not detected when the protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, where MAT I/III appears in a concentration-dependent equilibrium (29Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), thus suggesting a role for it on the association. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the key role of the disulfide on MAT assembly; this, to the best of our knowledge, is the first description of such a role for this type of covalent bond in a cytosolic oligomer. Methionine, ATP, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, DTT, ampicillin, GSH, GSSG, cyanogen bromide, 4-vinylpyridine, iodoacetamide, and the molecular mass standards for gel filtration chromatography were products from Sigma. NEM and trypsin sequencing grade were purchased from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany) and Roche Diagnostics (Barcelona, Spain), respectively. [2-3H]ATP (20 Ci/mmol) and [1,414C]NEM (2–10 mCi/mmol) were supplied by AmershamBiosciences and ARC Inc. (St. Louis, MO), respectively. Isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was a product of Ambion (Austin, TX). Phenyl Sepharose CL-4B and Superose 12 HR 10/30 were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Optiphase HiSafe 3 scintillation fluid was obtained from E & G Wallac (Milton Keynes, UK). Cation exchanger AG-50W-X4, goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, Bio-Rad protein assay kit I, and the electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. YM-30 ultrafiltration membranes and glass microfiber filters GF/B were purchased from Amicon Corp. (Beverly, MA) and Whatman Ltd. (Maidstone, UK), respectively. Chemiluminescence Renaissance reagents and BCA were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and Pierce, respectively. Urea, Me2SO, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Merck. The rest of the buffers and reagents were of the best quality commercially available. Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the plasmid pSSRL-T7N, which contains the sequence of wild type MAT, or the mutants for the cysteine residues of the protein (23Mingorance J. Alvarez L. Sánchez-Góngora E. Mato J.M. Pajares M.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cells were grown on LB medium plus ampicillin and expression induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (30Alvarez L. Mingorance J. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were isolated after disruption of the cells by sonication and purified as described by López-Vara et al. (31López-Vara M.C. Gasset M. Pajares M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Refolding was carried out using either 10 mm DTT or a redox buffer composed by GSH/GSSG (10:1) at 10 mm GSH. Purification of the DTT-refolded proteins was carried out as previously described but using a Q-Sepharose column (31López-Vara M.C. Gasset M. Pajares M.A. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), whereas GSH/GSSG-refolded MATs needed an additional purification step on phenyl Sepharose. The purity of the samples was tested by SDS-PAGE, and the final protein samples were characterized by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopies. Purified samples were concentrated by ultrafiltration through YM-30 membranes to obtain the desired range of protein concentrations. Samples of 100 μl were injected on a Superose 12 HR 10/30 gel filtration column connected to an Advanced Protein Purification System (Waters) and eluted using 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 10 mm MgSO4(buffer A) containing 150 mm KCl at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. A 280 was recorded, and 210-μl fractions were collected for their use in dot blot and MAT activity measurements. The peak and shoulder corresponding to GSH/GSSG-refolded MAT III and I, respectively, were concentrated and reloaded on the same column, and their elution volumes were determined as above. In parallel, 2-ml samples of the same protein concentrations were loaded on 3-ml phenyl Sepharose columns equilibrated in buffer A, washed with 20 ml of the equilibration buffer, and eluted with 10 ml of buffer A containing 50% (v/v) Me2SO. Only the first 5-ml fractions of sample loading (MAT I) and Me2SO elution (MAT III) were used for dot blot, MAT activity, and protein concentration measurements. Moreover, to follow dissociation MAT I fractions were collected, diluted 5-fold with buffer A, and incubated for 30 min prior to reloading on new phenyl Sepharose columns. Again fractions corresponding to MAT I and MAT III were collected and used for dot blot, MAT activity, and protein concentration measurements. A 50 mm stock solution of ANS in methanol was prepared, and its concentration was determined using ε370 = 6800m−1 cm−1 (32Haugland R.P. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals.

ANS was added to a 20-μl MAT I sample (1–4 mg/ml) to render a final concentration, upon dilution (1:50), of 40 μm, and to pre-equilibrated MAT III solutions (1 ml) of 20–80 μg/ml. Controls for each case were prepared accordingly, and the reaction was carried out for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The final methanol concentration in the samples was 0.08% (v/v). Fluorescence emission at 470 nm was recorded for 8 min upon excitation at 380 nm in a photon counting SLM-8000 spectrofluorometer. MAT I kinetics were recorded immediately after dilution with a dead time 5 s. The data were corrected for base line and instrumental factors and adjusted to one- or two-phase exponential decays using the program GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA) and the following equations. Y=Ae−kt+Y∞Equation 1 Y=Ae−Xt+Ae−Zt+Y∞Equation 2 where Y is the fluorescence intensity at 470 nm;A is the amplitude of the signal; t is the time;k, X, and Z, the rate constants; andY ∞ is the fluorescence intensity at an infinite time. The dissociation constants were determined using a Biogel A gel filtration column (0.7 × 9 cm) equilibrated in buffer A containing 150 mm KCl. The column was run at 25 °C at a flow rate of 0.23 ml/min, and the accuracy of the flow was controlled by weighting fractions collected before and after each individual run (33Beckett D. Coligan J.E. Dunn B.M. Speicher D.W. Wingfield P.T. Current Protocols in Protein Science. John Wiley & Sons Inc., New York1999: 20.5.1-20.5.13Google Scholar). Purified proteins, wild type and mutants, were concentrated by ultrafiltration, as described above, to obtain the desired range of protein concentrations (0.05–5 mg/ml), and 3.5 ml of large zones were collected. Loading was performed at least 1 h after sample preparation to ensure equilibrium. Elution was followed byA 280 and dot blot analysis of the 75-μl fractions collected. The data obtained by both methods were used to determine the centroid volume for each zone using GraphPad Prism. The centroid volumes were then used to calculate the weight-average partition coefficient (ςw) and the corresponding dimer fraction (f D) according to the following equations. ςw=(Vc−Vo)/ViEquation 3 fD=(ςW−ςT)/(ςD−ςT)Equation 4 where V c is the centroid volume for the large zone; V o is the void volume; Viis the included volume of the column; ςT is the partition coefficient for the tetramer; and ςD is the partition coefficient of the dimer determined experimentally. A plot of f D versus log of the dimer concentration allows calculation of the equilibrium constant.f D values were also used to determine the free energy of the process using equations analogous to those described by Park and Bedouelle (34Park Y.C. Bedouelle H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18052-18059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) for a dimer-monomer equilibrium. KfD+4cfD2−K=0Equation 5 ΔG=ΔG(H2O)−mx=−RT ln(K)Equation 6 The total free energy of the process, from MAT I to the unfolded protein, can be calculated using the following expression. ΔGtot=ΔG1+2ΔG2Equation 7 where f D is the fraction of protein as dimer;c is the protein concentration; R is the gas constant; T is the absolute temperature; ΔG is the free energy of the process; ΔG 1 is the free energy of the tetramer-dimer conversion; ΔG 2 is the free energy calculated for the dimer-monomer unfolding; m in this particular case is the slope of the dependence of the thermodynamical parameter upon protein concentration; ΔG tot is the free energy of the total process, tetramer to monomer unfolding; and K is the equilibrium constant. The samples of the column fractions (maximum volume, 30 μl) were spotted on nitrocellulose membranes. After denaturation using 6 m guanidinium chloride (50 μl), the membrane was washed twice with TTBS (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20), before the blocking step using low fat dry milk (3% w/v). The membrane was washed again with TTBS and incubated with a 1:20000 (v/v) solution of an anti-MAT polyclonal antibody prepared in our laboratory using DTT-refolded MAT. Under these conditions the only band detected corresponds to MAT in SDS-PAGE gels. The membranes were revealed using Renaissance, the exposed films were subjected to densitometric scanning, and the data were used for the corresponding calculations. The number of free −SH groups for wild type and mutant MATs was determined as described previously using NEM labeling (15Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Pajares M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Pajares M.A. Corrales F.J. Ochoa P. Mato J.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, for quantitation of free cysteine residues and disulfide bonds in wild type and mutant MAT proteins, samples of the purified proteins were dialyzed against ammonium acetate extensively and lyophilized, and the content of reduced and oxidized cysteine residues was determined by mass spectrometry. To this end, ∼1 mg/ml of protein in 150 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.6, 1 mmEDTA, 6 m guanidinium chloride was heated for 5 min at 80 °C, cooled down to room temperature, incubated either with 10 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature or with 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for 2 min at 100 °C, followed by the addition of a 5-fold molar excess of 4-vinylpyridine or iodoacetamide over reducing agent, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were dialyzed against deionized MilliQ water and lyophilized. Aliquots of these samples were subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry using a PE Biosciences Voyager DE-Pro instrument and sinapinic acid (saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile) as matrix. To locate free cysteines and disulfide bonds within the primary structure of MAT (Swiss-Prot S06114), native and ethylpyridylated proteins (10 mg/ml in 70% formic acid) were degraded with cyanogen bromide (100 mg/ml) overnight in the dark under a nitrogen atmosphere. In addition, native and carboxyamidomethylated proteins (1 mg/ml in 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.3, 10 mmiodoacetamide) were degraded with sequencing grade trypsin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w) overnight at 37 °C. Mass fingerprinting of the digests was done by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry using α-cyanocinnamic acid (saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 50% acetonitrile) as matrix. N-terminal sequence analyses of the purified wild type and mutant MAT proteins were done using an Applied Biosystems 473A sequencer following the manufacturer's instructions. The results indicated that 70% of the protein had a complete N-terminal sequence (MNGPVDGL), whereas the rest had lost the initial methionine. These data were taken into account in the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry calculations. The samples (0.1–5 mg/ml) were loaded on the An50Ti rotor of a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments Inc.) equipped with absorbance optics, and the experiments were performed at 50,000 rpm and 18 °C. Absorbance scans (step size, 0.005 cm) were taken at 280 nm. The sedimentation velocity data were analyzed with the program Svedberg (35Philo J.S. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 435-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and the sedimentation velocity coefficients were corrected for solvent composition and temperature to obtains 20,W (36van Holde K.E. Physical Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. Prentice-Hall, Uppersaddle River, NJ1986: 110-136Google Scholar). Protein concentration of the samples after ultrafiltration was measured using the Bio-Rad kit I and using bovine serum albumin as a standard. However, protein concentration on the fractions collected from analytical phenyl Sepharose columns was determined after trichloroacetic acid precipitation using the BCA system, because of the presence of Me2SO. MAT activity was measured as described by Gil et al. (37Gil B. Pajares M.A. Mato J.M. Alvarez L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1251-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) using 160-μl samples of the column fractions. Kinetics for methionine and ATP were performed in the concentration range comprised from 1 μm to 10 mm for one of the substrates while keeping the other constant at 5 mm (2Pajares M.A. Durán C. Corrales F. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Oxidation constants and GSSG inhibition were measured as previously described (2Pajares M.A. Durán C. Corrales F. Pliego M.M. Mato J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17598-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Martı́nez-Chantar M.L. Pajares M.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Rat liver MAT has been shown to appear in a concentration-dependent equilibrium upon its overexpression in E. coli cytosol. However, there are no indications that such equilibrium takes place in the rat liver-purified enzyme forms. In an attempt to clarify the difference among these proteins and get insight into the structure-function facts that regulate MAT oligomerization, we have used two refolding systems described previously in our laboratory. The use of DTT rendered only dimers at the protein concentrations used for refolding, but concentration by ultrafiltration caused the apparition of tetramers (Fig.1, A and B). On the other hand, replacement of DTT by a GSH/GSSG redox buffer allowed the production of a mixture of tetramers and dimers, which do not associate upon enhancement of the protein concentration (Fig. 1, C andD). Reloading of both GSH/GSSG-refolded MAT I and III on gel filtration chromatography showed no variation in the elution position for both association states (Fig. 1 E). These results were confirmed on analytical phenyl Sepharose chromatography, a procedure that allows the quantitative separation of MAT I and III forms by means of differences in hydrophobicity (39Kunz G.L. Hoffman J.L. Chia C. Stremel B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1980; 202: 565-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Association was also studied by sedimentation velocity, but the use of this technique was precluded because complete dissociation of tetramers to dimers and monomers was already observed at the highest protein concentrations tested (2 mg/ml). Dissociation of MAT I was then studied by analytical phenyl Sepharose chromatography. As can be observed, isolated DTT-refolded MAT I render tetramers and dimers upon reloading on the hydrophobic columns, whereas GSH/GSSG-refolded MAT I appears as a stable tetramer (Fig.2, A and F). More information about the dissociation process was then obtained by fluorescence spectroscopy of ANS-bound DTT-refolded MAT I samples (Fig.3 A). Dilution followed by immediate recording of the fluorescence emission at 470 nm revealed the presence of an exponential decay, until the emission levels corresponding to an ANS-bound dimer were reached (Fig. 3 B). This decay was preceded by a short lag phase, suggesting the presence of at least one intermediate in the process (Fig. 3 A,inset). The fluorescence intensity of MAT I corresponded to the double of that for MAT III, thus indicating that the dye binds in an area not related to association. This change cannot be followed by intrinsic fluorescence, because no significant changes in the Trp and Tyr emissions were detectable (data not shown). The same is true for other spectroscopic techniques, such as circular dichroism, because MAT I and III show identical spectra. The data were then analyzed using either one- or two-phase exponential decays (Equations 1 and 2), with the best fit being obtained by a single exponential. The calculated rate constant (k off) for dissociation to MAT III is 0.022 s−1, and the calculated half-life for MAT I upon dilution is 14.69 ± 0.5 s at 25 °C. Large-zone gel filtration chromatography was then used for the calculation of the dissociation constants (Fig. 4). Using large zones in the 0.05–5 mg/ml range, the centroid volumes for each protein concentration were calculated and used to determine the weight-average partition coefficients (Equation 3) and the dimer fraction (Equation 4). These data were then used to obtain theK d value for the DTT-refolded MAT, which was found to be in the 105m−1 range (TableI). Moreover, the free energy of association was calculated using this dissociation constant in Equation6, as well as using the dimer fractions in Equations 5 and 6 (TableI).Figure 3Kinetics of MAT I dissociation followed by ANS fluorescence. Wild type MAT was DTT-refolded and purified. A concentrated sample (4 mg/ml), MAT I, was incubated with ANS and diluted to 0.08 mg/ml immediately before recording fluorescence at 470 nm (A). The inset shows an enlargement of the initial phases of the reaction. Samples of MAT III (0.08 mg/ml) were also incubated with ANS, and their fluorescence was recorded (B). The data were fitted to one- or two-phase exponential decays as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Determination of theK d for wild type MAT by large- zone gel filtration chromatography.

The centroid volume for each zone was determined and used for the calculation of the weight-average partition coefficient and the fD.

Both nonconservative and conservative substitutions of Val200 caused very strong inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity, whereas substitutions of other residues on this loop reduced activity only moderately. All of the Val200 mutants formed phosphoenzyme intermediate (EP) from ATP. Isomerization from ADP-sensitiveEP (E1P) to ADP-insensitive EP (E2P) was not inhibited in the mutants, and a substantially larger amount of E2P actually accumulated in the mutants than in wild-type sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase at steady state. In contrast, decay of EP formed from ATP in the presence of Ca2+ was strongly inhibited in the mutants. Hydrolysis of E2P formed from Piin the absence of Ca2+ was also strongly inhibited but was faster than the decay of EP formed from ATP, indicating that the main kinetic limitation of the decay comes after loss of ADP sensitivity but before E2P hydrolysis. On the basis of the well accepted mechanism of the Ca2+-ATPase, the limitation is likely associated with the Ca2+-releasing step fromE2P·Ca2. On the other hand, the rate of activation of dephosphorylated enzyme on high affinity Ca2+binding was not altered by the substitutions. In light of the crystal structures, the present results strongly suggest that Val200 confers appropriate interactions of the Lys189–Lys205 loop with the P domain in the Ca2+-released form of E2P. Results further suggest that these interactions, however, do not contribute much to domain organization in the dephosphorylated enzyme and thus would be mostly lost on E2P hydrolysis.

Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar). According to the E1/E2 transport mechanism (Fig.1) (3Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Google Scholar, 4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar, 5de Meis L. Vianna A.L. Annu. Rev.

Physiol. 1985; 47: 573-601Google Scholar), the enzyme is activated by the binding of two Ca2+ ions (E1·Ca2, steps 1–2) and then autophosphorylated by MgATP to form an ADP-sensitive phosphoenzyme (E1P, step 3). On formation of this EP, the bound Ca2+ ions are occluded in the transport sites. The subsequent isomeric transition to the ADP-insensitive form (E2P, step 4) will result in a reduction in affinity and a change in orientation of the Ca2+ binding sites and thus a Ca2+ release into lumen (step 5). Finally, hydrolysis takes place and returns the enzyme into an unphosphorylated and Ca2+-unbound form (E2, step 6). The main kinetic limitation in this cycle is associated with the mechanism of Ca2+ release before the hydrolysis of E2P (8Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Kosk-Kosicka D. Lewis D. Scofano H. Guimaraes-Moth H. Z. Naturforsch. 1982; 37: 685-691Google Scholar, 9Froehlieh J. Heller P.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 126-136Google Scholar). E2P can also be formed from Pi in the presence of Mg2+ and absence of Ca2+ by reversal of the hydrolysis ofE2P. The three-dimensional structure of Ca2+-ATPase with bound Ca2+ (E1·Ca2) and, very recently, the structure without bound Ca2+ and with bound thapsigargin (E2(TG)), were solved by x-ray crystallography at the atomic level (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar, 11Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Google Scholar). The enzyme has three cytoplasmic domains (A, N, and P) that are widely separated inE1·Ca2 and associated in E2(TG). The modeling with a low resolution map of tubular crystals formed with decavanadate (E2V) revealed (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar) that three cytoplasmic domains gather to form a most compactly organized single headpiece inE2V (see Fig. 7). Our previous limited and systematic proteolysis experiments showed (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar) that E2V is very similar to the Ca2+-released form of E2P in the domain organization and that this EP is the intermediate with the most compactly organized headpiece in the catalytic cycle. The results further indicated that a large motion of the A domain (i.e. rotation by ∼90° (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar)) and the strong association of the A domain with the P and N domains most likely occur during the isomerization of EP and Ca2+ release and suggested that the stabilization energy provided by intimate contacts between all three cytoplasmic domains in E2P provides energy for moving transmembrane helices and releases the bound Ca2+ ions. To substantiate such changes in cytoplasmic domain organization and their roles in the Ca2+ transport, it is essential to find the regions and residues involved in the domain-domain interactions and reveal their actual roles in the catalytic steps. The conserved outermost TGES loop (Thr181–Ser184) on the A domain is situated at the interface of the A and P domains inE2V. This loop was previously found to be essential for the isomerization of EP (14Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14088-14092Google Scholar) and predicted by iron-catalyzed cleavage with Na+/K+-ATPase to participate in Mg2+ binding with specific residues in the conserved TGDGVND loop (starting from Thr701 with Ca2+-ATPase) on the P domain in E2P andE2 (15Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar). One more outermost loop is located on the outer surface of the A domain in E1·Ca2 but situated at the A-P domain interface in E2V, the Lys189–Lys205 loop that includes the tryptic T2 site (Arg198) (see Fig. 7). We had actually indicated by site-directed chemical modification (16Saino T. Daiho T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21142-21150Google Scholar) and mutations (17Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Google Scholar) as well as by the limited proteolysis (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar) that Arg198 comes very close to the phosphorylation site when E2P without bound Ca2+ is formed and that the positive charge of this residue is important for its rapid hydrolysis. These findings suggest that the Lys189–Lys205 loop may have critical roles in domain organization, particularly in the Ca2+-released form of E2P. In the present study, we therefore further explored possible roles of the Lys189–Lys205 outermost loop by mutagenesis and found that Val200 is critical for rapid processing of E2P, most likely in steps 5 and 6. With the crystal structures, our results suggest that Val200 confers appropriate interactions between polar residues on the Lys189–Lys205 loop with those on the P domain in the Ca2+-released form of E2P and, further, that these interactions would be mostly lost on the hydrolysis ofE2P. Overlap extension PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) was used for the substitution of residues in the Lys189–Lys205 region in rabbit SERCA1a cDNA. The ApaI-KpnI restriction fragments were excised from the PCR products and ligated back into the corresponding region in the full-length SERCA1a cDNA in the pMT2 expression vector (19Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Google Scholar). The pMT2 DNA was transfected into COS-1 cells by the liposome-mediated transfection method. Microsomes were prepared from the cells as described previously (20Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Google Scholar). The “control microsomes” were prepared from COS-1 cells transfected with the pMT2 vector containing no SERCA1a cDNA. The amount of expressed SERCA1a was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously (21Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Suzuki H. Saino T. Kanazawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23910-23915Google Scholar). The expression levels of all the mutants in the microsomes were comparable with those of the wild type. The rate of ATP hydrolysis was determined at 25 °C in the presence and absence of 0.5 μmthapsigargin in a mixture containing 20 μg/ml microsomal protein, 1 μmA23187, 5 mm [γ-32P]ATP, 7 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 0.55 mmCaCl2, and 0.5 mm EGTA. The specific ATPase activity/mg of expressed SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount of expressed SERCA1a and the ATPase activity of expressed SERCA1a, which was obtained by subtraction of the thapsigargin-sensitive ATPase activity of the control microsomes from that of the microsomes expressing SERCA1a. This background level with the control microsomes was as low as 4% of the activity of microsomes expressing the wild-type SERCA1a. Phosphorylation of SERCA1a in microsomes with [γ-32P]ATP or32Pi and dephosphorylation of32P-labeled SERCA1a were performed under the conditions described in the legends to the figures and tables. The reactions were quenched with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid containing Pi. Rapid kinetics measurements of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation were performed with a handmade rapid mixing apparatus (22Kanazawa T. Saito M. Tonomura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1970; 67: 693-711Google Scholar) and otherwise as described above. The precipitated proteins were separated at pH 6.0 by 5% SDS-PAGE according to Weber and Osborn (23Weber K. Osborn M. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 4406-4412Google Scholar). The radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase was quantitated by digital autoradiography as described (17Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Google Scholar). The amount ofEP formed with the expressed SERCA1a was obtained by subtracting the background radioactivity with the control microsomes. This background was less than 5% of the radioactivity of EP formed with the expressed wild-type SERCA1a. The amount ofEP/mg of SERCA1a protein was calculated from the amount ofEP thus obtained and the amount of expressed SERCA1a. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression using the program Origin (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Three-dimensional models were reproduced by the program Swiss-PdbViewer (25Guex N.

The substitution of Val200 with Ala resulted in very strong inhibition of the activity, whereas nonconservative substitutions of Lys189, His190, Thr191, Pro193, Val194, Arg198, Ala199, Gln202, Asp203, Lys204, and Lys205 caused only slight or moderate reduction, and those of Asp196, Pro197, and Asn201caused almost no change or rather a slight increase. Moderate effects of substitutions of Asp196, Arg198, Gln202, and Asp203 on the activity were also reported previously (4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar, 17Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Google Scholar, 26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar), and the results are in essential agreement. Substitutions of Glu192 and Pro195caused no loss of function (4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar). We then focused on Val200, of which substitutions gave distinguishably strong inhibition, and substituted with various amino acids including nonpolar and polar (positively charged, negatively charged, and uncharged) amino acids (Ala, Ile, Arg, Lys, Asp, Thr, and Gln). The activity was strongly inhibited in the mutants V200I, V200D, V200T, and V200Q and further reduced in the mutants V200A, V200R, and V200K (Fig.3).Figure 3ATPase activities of various Val200 mutants. The thapsigargin-sensitive specific ATPase activity of Val200mutants was determined and represented as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We then performed kinetic analysis on the formation and decay of EP with these Val200 mutants at 0 °C under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay. All of the mutants possessed the ability to form EP, and the amount formed was comparable with that of wild type (TableI). As shown in Fig. 4, the time course of E2P formation from ATP was examined in the presence and absence of K+. Under both sets of conditions, the total amount of EP reached its maximum level within 1 s after the addition of ATP and remained unchanged for the time periods of observation (120 s) (data not shown). Thus, the time course actually reflects E2P accumulation from E1P. In the presence of K+, the amount of accumulated E2P at steady state in wild type was very low (Fig. 4 A), in agreement with the previous observations on the effects of K+ (27Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1451-1457Google Scholar). In contrast, a substantial amount ofE2P was accumulated with the mutants, especially V200A and V200I. In the absence of K+, a large amount ofE2P accumulated at steady state in wild type as well as in the mutants (Fig. 4 B), thus the time courses can be clearly compared. The E2P accumulation apparently proceeded with first-order kinetics, and the apparent rate to reach the steady state (k formation) was estimated (TableII). The rates obtained in the mutants in the absence of K+ were comparable with the rate in wild type, with somewhat lower rates in V200R and V200K. These rates obtained in the mutants are also comparable with their rates in the presence of K+. The results indicate that theE1P to E2P isomerization (i.e. loss of ADP sensitivity) is not significantly inhibited by the Val200 substitutions. Results also suggest that the substitutions (especially in V200A and V200I) affected the equilibrium in step 4 in favor of E2P·Ca2.Table ITotal amount of EP formed from ATPEP formed from ATP+ K+(−)nmol/mg SERCA1aWild type3.8 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.2V200A3.8 ± 0.23.8 ± 0.2V200I3.6 ± 0.13.3 ± 0.2V200R3.6 ± 0.23.3 ± 0.2V200K3.9 ± 0.13.6 ± 0.3V200D4.8 ± 0.44.2 ± 0.2V200T5.0 ± 0.33.9 ± 0.4V200Q4.9 ± 0.34.4 ± 0.2Microsomes expressing the wild-type or mutant SERCA1a were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP at 0 °C for 15 s in 100 μl of the mixture containing 5 μg of microsomal protein, 1 μmA23187, 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP, 50 μm CaCl2, 7 mm MgCl2, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), and 0.1 m KCl (+K+) or 0.1 m LiCl without added KCl ((−)), and the total amounts of EP were determined.

In parentheses, the k decay and thek hydrolysis values obtained with the wild type are normalized to 100%. Decay of EP formed from ATP (Fig.5) and hydrolysis of E2P formed from Pi (Fig. 6) were then examined at 0 °C under conditions otherwise similar to those for the ATPase assay (i.e. in the presence of K+). Decay of EP formed from ATP was determined first by phosphorylation with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence of K+ and Ca2+ for 15 s and then termination of phosphorylation by the addition of excess EGTA to prevent further phosphorylation and thus allow the decay of32P-labeled EP (Fig. 5). The EP decay was markedly slowed by the Val200 substitutions. The time courses were apparently fitted very well with a single exponential, although a substantial amount of E2P (in addition toE1P) was accumulated in the mutants at the start of the decay reaction (see Fig. 4 A). The results indicate that processing of EP after loss of ADP sensitivity (i.e. step 5 and/or step 6) was strongly inhibited by the substitutions. The apparent decay rate (k decay) was strongly reduced in V200D, V200Q, V200T, and V200I to ∼30–20% of that of the wild type and was further reduced to ∼10% in V200A, V200K, and V200R (Table II). It should be noted that the extent of reduction in k decay agreed well with that of inhibition of ATPase activity (cf. Table II and Fig. 3). Also, in each mutant the k decay value is much lower than the k formation value.Figure 6Hydrolysis of E2P formed from Pi. Microsomes were phosphorylated with 32Pi at 25 °C for 10 min in 50 μl of a mixture containing 10 μg of microsomal protein, 0.1 mm32Pi, 7 mmMgCl2, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), 35% (v/v) Me2SO, and 5 mm EGTA. The mixture was then cooled and diluted at 0 °C by the addition of 0.95 ml of a mixture containing 2.1 mm non-radioactive Pi, 7 mm MgCl2, 105 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS/Tris (pH 7.0), and 5 mm EGTA. At different times after the dilution, hydrolysis was quenched with trichloroacetic acid.

The amounts of EP formed with 32Pi at zero time (nmol/mg of expressed SERCA1a, the mean ± S.D., n = 4) were 3.3 ± 0.8 (wild type), 3.0 ± 0.8 (V200A), 3.5 ± 1.0 (V200I), 2.3 ± 0.8 (V200R), 3.5 ± 0.9 (V200K), 3.7 ± 1.1 (V200D), 3.6 ± 1.0 (V200T), and 3.7 ± 1.1 (V200Q). These values are normalized to 100%. Solid lines show the least squares fit to a single exponential, and the first-order rate constants (k hydrolysis) obtained are given in Table II.Inset, hydrolysis during the short period of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To examine the hydrolysis of E2P without bound Ca2+ (step 6), the enzyme was first phosphorylated by 32Piwithout Ca2+ in the absence of K+ and the presence of 35% (v/v) Me2SO, which extremely favorsE2P formation (28de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Google Scholar), and then the phosphorylated samples were diluted with a large volume of a solution containing K+ and non-radioactive Pi (Fig. 6). The conditions were thus made otherwise identical to those used for the E2P formation from ATP in Fig. 4 A and the decay of EP formed from ATP in Fig. 5. The hydrolysis of 32P-labeledE2P proceeded with first-order kinetics, and its rate (k hydrolysis) was summarized in Table II. The rate was moderately reduced in V200D and largely reduced in V200T and V200Q (8 and 7% that of wild type, respectively). It was further reduced in V200A, V200I, V200K, and V200R (less than 3% that of wild type). For the mutants, the above kinetic results show that the decay of EP formed from ATP in the presence of Ca2+ is much slower than the accumulation of E2P from ATP and also that the EP decay is substantially slower than the E2P hydrolysis in the absence of Ca2+(as is most clearly shown with V200K, V200D, V200T, and V200Q). The results indicate for the mutants that the main kinetic limitation (although not the only one) in the decay of EP formed from ATP comes after loss of ADP sensitivity (step 4) but beforeE2P hydrolysis (step 6). On the basis of the well accepted mechanism of the Ca2+-ATPase (Fig. 1), it is therefore likely that step 5 associated with Ca2+ release is greatly slowed by the Val200 substitutions and is the main kinetic limitation in the mutants. 2The results with the wild type (the very low accumulation of E2P in spite of the slowk decay) are accounted for by the equilibrium in step 4 favoring E1P·Ca2 (29Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Lewis D. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 154-190Google Scholar). To account for this very low E2P accumulation, it is also possible to assume the rate-limiting E1P to E2P isomerization (step 4) followed by rapid Ca2+ release (step 5) and hydrolysis (step 6). In any case, however, the same conclusion as described in text will be made for the mutants that the step after loss of ADP sensitivity but before hydrolysis of E2P is greatly slowed by the Val200 substitutions. For the mutants, the actual rate of formation of E2P fromE1P on isomerization (k isomerization) in the presence of K+ can be estimated by assuming the equilibrium in step 4 without further processing ofEP (because of the subsequent very slow processing as described above for the mutants). Thek isomerization value thus estimated for the mutants (s−1) by an equation,k isomerization =k formation × (fraction of E2P at steady state), was 0.063 (V200A), 0.108 (V200I), 0.011 (V200R), 0.013 (V200K), 0.032 (V200D), 0.036 (V200T), and 0.084 (V200Q). These values are in fact substantially larger than thek decay values (as most clearly shown with V200A, V200I, V200R, V200T, and V200Q). Ca2+dependence of phosphorylation with ATP was determined in the presence of K+ at various concentrations of Ca2+ under conditions as described in the legend to Table I and thus similar to those for the ATPase assay. The experiments were performed with the four representative mutants (V200A, V200I, V200R, V200T) and wild-type SERCA1a. The dissociation constant for Ca2+ and Hill coefficient obtained by least square fits for these mutants (0.20–0.29 μm and 1.8–2.0, respectively) were nearly the same as those for wild type (0.27 μm and 1.9, respectively). To compare the rate of the E2 toE1·Ca2 transition, the four mutants and wild type were preincubated in the absence of Ca2+ at pH 6, where equilibrium between E1 and E2 is most shifted to E2 (30Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Google Scholar) and then phosphorylated by the simultaneous addition of saturating concentrations of Ca2+and ATP under otherwise identical conditions as described above. The time course of EP formation was well described by the first order kinetics (data not shown). The rates (s−1) obtained with the mutants (0.178 (V200A), 0.122 (V200I), 0.140 (V200R), and 0.204 (V200T)) were almost the same as or only slightly lower than that of the wild type (0.204). When ATP was added to the wild-type and mutant enzymes were preincubated with Ca2+, the EP formation was much faster and reached its maximal level within 1 s (data not shown). These results show that the Ca2+-inducedE2 to E1·Ca2 transition, which is rate-limiting for the EP formation, takes place at almost the same rate in the mutants and wild type. In the present study, we explored possible roles of the Lys189–Lys205 loop on the A domain by mutagenesis and found that Val200 is critical for rapid processing of E2P, most likely in step 5, and also for rapid hydrolysis of E2P in step 6 in the Ca2+transport cycle (Fig. 1). During isomerization of EP and Ca2+ release, a large movement of the A domain (i.e. rotation by ∼90° (10Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Google Scholar)) and its strong association with the P and N domains occur to form the most compactly organized cytoplasmic domains in E2P without bound Ca2+(12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar). In this E2P, a hydrophobic atmosphere (28de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Google Scholar, 31de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Google Scholar, 32Dupont Y. Pougeois R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 93-98Google Scholar, 33de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 333-349Google Scholar) is thus realized around the phosphorylation site, and a specific water molecule can now attack the acylphosphate bond. It is likely that the Lys189–Lys205 loop, especially Val200, is critical for the appropriate domain interactions and proper structure in E2P without bound Ca2+. In E2V that is very similar to E2P without bound Ca2+ in the cytoplasmic domain organization (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar), the Lys189–Lys205 loop forms an A-P domain interface (Fig. 7). The side chain of Val200 protrudes toward the P domain and is in van der Waals contact with the side chain hydrocarbon parts of Arg198, Gln202, and Asp203, which interact with polar residues on the P domain by hydrogen bonding or salt bridge formation (broken green lines in Fig. 7). It is likely that Val200 coordinates spatial arrangement of these surrounding residues by the nonpolar interactions so as to produce the most favorable configuration for appropriate interactions at the terminal N and O atoms with the polar residues on P domain and thus for concurrent contribution of these residues to intimate contact between the A and P domains in E2P without bound Ca2+. In agreement with this view, the substitutions of Val200 by any examined conservative or nonconservative amino acids resulted in strong inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase activity because of inhibition of the EP decay, whereas substitutions of each of the above surrounding three residues caused only moderately reduced activity (Fig. 2 and Refs. 17Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Google Scholar and 26Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar). Actually, the positive charge of Arg198 was previously shown to be important for rapidE2P hydrolysis, and its nonconservative substitutions partially reduce the k hydrolysis value (by 62%) (17Daiho T. Suzuki H. Yamasaki K. Saino T. Kanazawa T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 54-58Google Scholar). Mutations of Glu680 (4MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar) and of Arg678 on the P domain (see Fig. 7) also cause only partial loss of function. 3K. Yamasaki, T. Daiho, S. Kato, and H. Suzuki, unpublished observation with Arg678 substitutions. It is likely that the substitutions at Val200 would seriously affect coordination of the surrounding residues and thus appropriate interactions of the Lys189–Lys205 loop with the P domain. The observed high Ca2+ affinity and rate of the Ca2+-induced activation in the Val200 mutants being comparable with those in the wild type (see “Results”) indicate that the interactions between the Lys189–Lys205 loop and the P domain likely do not contribute much to cytoplasmic domain organization in the unphosphorylated states and thus would be mostly lost on E2P hydrolysis. In fact, in E2(TG) that is very similar toE2 in the cytoplasmic domain organization (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar), no hydrogen bonds or salt bridges are found between the Lys189–Lys205 loop and the P domain (Fig. 7). Consistently, the enzyme in E2 state is rapidly attacked and degraded by proteinase K and V8 protease, whereas E2P without bound Ca2+ is completely resistant to all proteinase K, V8 protease, and trypsin at the T2 site (Arg198) (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar). E2 is, however, partially resistant to tryptic attack at the T2 site, indicating that the A domain in this state is still partially associated with the P and N domains and has not yet completely rotated back to the widely separated state found in E1·Ca2 (12Danko S. Daiho T. Yamasaki K. Kamidochi M. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 489: 277-282Google Scholar, 13Danko S. Yamasaki K. Daiho T. Suzuki H. Toyoshima C. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 129-135Google Scholar), as is in fact seen in the E2(TG) structure. Possible interactions between the A and N domains and between the TGES loop and the P domain (possibly through ligation of Mg2+ (15Patchornik G. Goldshleger R. Karlish S.J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11954-11959Google Scholar)), may be significant for holding the A domain in such an organized state inE2. On hydrolysis of E2P to E2, the atmosphere around the phosphorylation site again becomes hydrophilic (28de Meis L. Martins O.B. Alves E.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 4252-4261Google Scholar, 31de Meis L. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1289-1294Google Scholar, 32Dupont Y. Pougeois R. FEBS Lett. 1983; 156: 93-98Google Scholar, 33de Meis L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 333-349Google Scholar). It is possible that loss of the interactions between the Lys189–Lys205 loop and the P domain contribute at least in part to such changes in hydrophobicity. In summary, we conclude that the Lys189–Lys205loop, especially Val200, is critical for the intimate contact between the A and P domains and the appropriate cytoplasmic domain organization in E2P without bound Ca2+. Although the structure of E2P·Ca2(ADP-insensitive EP with occluded Ca2+ (8Inesi G. Kurzmack M. Kosk-Kosicka D. Lewis D. Scofano H. Guimaraes-Moth H. Z. Naturforsch. 1982; 37: 685-691Google Scholar)) is not yet characterized, the final process of appropriate gathering and intimate contact of the A domain with the P and N domains will likely be accomplished in step 5 after the loss of ADP sensitivity, and this change is likely essential for Ca2+ release into lumen.

Chem. 1987; 262: 3331-3337Google Scholar, 9Reines D. Chamberlin M.J. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10799-10809Google Scholar, 10SivaRaman L. Reines D. Kane C.M. J. Biol.

The molecular mechanism of this phenomenon has been investigated extensively in in vitrosystems, and it has been shown that S-II stimulates the nuclease activity of RNA polymerase II, which then cleaves the nascent transcript. Then the 3′-end of the nascent RNA is realigned with the catalytic site of RNA polymerase II, and the transcription elongation complex tries reading through the arrest site again (11Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 12Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar, 13Reines D. J. Biol.

The cleavage stimulation activity of S-II can be separated from its read-through stimulating activity; although the cleavage stimulation activity is essential, it is not sufficient to promote read-through of RNA polymerase II in vitro (15Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Google Scholar). There have been several reports describing the function of S-II inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. In several yeast strains bear null mutations of the genes encoding the transcription elongation machinery, such as spt4Δ, rpb9Δ, and ctk1Δ, S-II is indispensable for cell proliferation under certain culture conditions (16Davie J.K. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5960-5973Google Scholar, 17Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Google Scholar, 18Jona G. Wittschieben B.O. Svejstrup J.Q. Gileadi O. Gene. 2001; 267: 31-36Google Scholar). Although Kulish et al. (19Kulish D. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4162-4168Google Scholar) reported that S-II promotes read-through of RNA polymerase II in vivoas well as in vitro, it remains to be elucidated whether S-II functions in vivo through its cleavage-stimulating activity, its read-through-stimulating activity, or both. S-II also plays a role in the development of 6-AU1 or MPA resistance in yeast (2Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar, 20Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Google Scholar) and in the expression of the pyrimidine-specific 5′-nucleotidase SDT1 gene; it is also involved in the induction of the IMP dehydrogenase IMD2 gene and the polyamine transporter TPO1 gene in response to treatment with 6-AU or MPA (21Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Google Scholar, 22Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Google Scholar, 23Desmoucelles C. Pinson B. Saint-Marc C. Daignan-Fornier B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27036-27044Google Scholar). Stimulation of expression of these genes is thought to be necessary for developing 6-AU and MPA resistance inS. cerevisiae. In this study, the two S-II activities were investigated in an effort to determine which are responsible for the biologic functions, such as drug resistance and transcription induction, in S. cerevisiae. Site-directed mutations were introduced into the S-II gene to generate mutant yeast strains that express S-II mutant proteins with different levels of cleavage and read-through stimulation activities in vitro. These strains were then tested to determine their sensitivity to 6-AU and MPA, their ability to induce the IMD2 gene in response to 6-AU treatment, and their temperature-sensitive growth retardation in combination with thespt4 null mutation. The results show that cleavage-stimulating, but not read-through-stimulating, activity correlates with the biologic functions of S-II, suggesting that the former activity of S-II is responsible for its functions in vivo. All yeast strains used in this study are summarized in Table I. HKY01 and HKY02 are S-II null mutant strains (courtesy of Dr. T. Ito) derived from YPH499 (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Google Scholar); S-II gene was disrupted by URA3 orHIS3 gene introduction in these strains, respectively. Plasmid pH1180 was constructed by inserting the 3.4-kb PvuII fragment of the S. cerevisiae S-II gene into pBluescript KS(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To screen for mutant clones, silent base-exchange mutations were introduced to form the following new restriction enzyme recognition sites in each mutant: KasI sites for Mt1 and Mt2; SacII sites for Mt3, Mt4, Mt8, and Mt9; an SphI site for Mt5; a BspT104I site for Mt6; and a PvuI site for Mt7. pMt1b was constructed by inserting the PstI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AAACTGCAGGATCTGGCGCCAGCGCCCTTAGCTGCAAAGATAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GGGGCCAGTTGTTCAGGTCCTAACTGTATGCC-3′ (TU-23) into thePstI-NcoI site of pH1180. pMt1 was constructed by inserting the PstI-KasI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CACAGTGTAGTCAGTCCGCATAAGAGCATTCATCATGG-3′ (TU-22) and 5′-TAAGGGCGCTGGCGCCAGATCCTTGGCATCG-3′ into thePstI-KasI site of pMt1b. pMt2b was constructed by inserting the PstI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers TU-22 and 5′-CATGCCATGGTGGCGCCAGCTGCGGCGTATAAGGCTTGCTTGGC-3′ into thePstI-NcoI site of pH1180. pMt2 was constructed by inserting the KasI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CAACGCACAGGGCGCCACCATAGAAAGG-3′ and TU-23 into the KasI-NcoI site of pMt2b. pMt3b was constructed by inserting the MfeI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-CTATCAATTGCAAACACAATCCGCGGATTTGCCATTGACCAC-3′ and TU-23 into theMfeI-NcoI site of pYSII-2 (2Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar). pMt3 was constructed by inserting the PstI-NcoI fragment of pYSII-2 to the PstI-NcoI site of pH1180. pMt4b was constructed by inserting the PstI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AAACTGCAGATCCGCGGATGAACCATTGACCACTGCTTGTACATGTG-3′ and TU-23 into the PstI-NcoI site of pH1180. pMt4 was constructed by inserting the PstI-SacII fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers TU-22 and 5′-GGTTCATCCGCGGATCTTGTTTGCAATTG-3′ into thePstI-SacII site of pMt4b. pMt5b was constructed by inserting the PstI-NcoI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers 5′-AAACTGCAGAAGCATGCGGTAACAGATGGGCTTTCTCTTAGAATAG-3′ and TU-23 into the PstI-NcoI site of pH1180. pMt5 was constructed by inserting the PstI-SphI fragment of the S-II gene amplified by PCR with the primers TU-22 and 5′-CATCTGTTACCGCATGCTTCACATGTACAG-3′ into thePstI-SphI site of pMt5. pMt6 to -9 were obtained by using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and pH1180 as a template. Primers used for mutants were 5′-GCCAGGTATGCTATAATTTATTCGAACGTCATATC-3′ and 5′-GATATGACGTTCGAATAAATTATAGCATACCTGGC-3′ for pMt6, 5′-CAGTCACCGATCGAGCTACATGTGGTAAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTTACCACATGTAGCTCGATCGGTGACTG-3′ for pMt7, 5′-CAATTGCAAACACAATCCGCGGATAATCCATTGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCAATGGATTATCCGCGGATTGTGTTTGCAATTG-3′ for pMt8, and 5′-CAATTGCAAACACAATCCGCGGATGAACC-3′ and 5′-GGTTCATCCGCGGATTGTGTTTGCAATTG-3′ for pMt9. After the presence of the mutations on the plasmid clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing, the BamHI-PvuI (pMt2) or PvuII (all other constructs) fragments were excised, and an EZ Yeast Transformation Kit (Qbiogene, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was used to introduce the fragments separately into HKY01 to create the S-II mutant strains designated Mt1 to Mt9. When the mutant S-II fragment is introduced by homologous recombination into the S-II locus, it loses theURA3 gene instead and is transformed to 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant. Therefore, we isolated 5-fluoroorotic acid-resistant HKY01 transformants and performed genomic PCR to screen for the desired mutants with the primers 5′-CACTCGATGATGGGACTACG-3′ and 5′-GCGCTAGTAAGACAGATAGG-3′ followed by restriction enzyme digestion. The introduction of the mutant sequences into the S-II locus was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. S-II genes were amplified from each S-II mutant strain, and sites of mutation were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Each mutant strain bore only the introduced mutation.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeHKY01MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1::URA3HKY02MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1::HIS3TU100MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 [pRS416 (URA3 CEN)]TU101MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 [pRS416 (URA3 CEN)] [pRS413 (HIS3 CEN)]TU102MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1::HIS3 [pRS416 (URA3 CEN)]Mt1MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1K242A/Q243AMt2MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1N252A/N255A/Q257AMt3MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Q/E291LMt4MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1F296AMt5MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1K307AMt6MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R200AMt7MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1F269AMt8MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Q/E291NMt9MATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Qspt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 spt4::URA3dst1Δspt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amberade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1::HIS3 spt4::URA3Mt1spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1K242A/Q243A spt4::URA3Mt2spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1N252A/N255A/Q257A spt4::URA3Mt3spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Q/E291L spt4::URA3Mt4spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1F296A spt4::URA3Mt5spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1K307A spt4::URA3Mt6spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R200A spt4::URA3Mt7spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1F269A spt4::URA3Mt8spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Q/E291N spt4::URA3Mt9spt4ΔMATa ura3–52 lys2–801amber ade2–101ochre trp1–Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 dst1R287Q spt4::URA3 Open table in a new tab A PCR-based gene disruption method (25Burke D. Dawson D. Stearns T. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 139-140Google Scholar) was used to prepare allspt4Δ strains. PCR with the plasmid pRS416 (Stratagene) as a template was used to prepare the DNA fragment containing the URA3 gene used to disrupt the SPT4gene. The primers used were 5′-ATTCATTACTATTATACATGTGATATCAGAACGGAAGGTTAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCAC-3′ and 5′-TTACACCTGGCCACATTCAGTTTGGCAAAAGCGAACGAGGCTGTGCGGTATTTCACACCG-3′. The resulting fragment was separately introduced to YPH499, HKY02, and Mt1 to -9 using an EZ Yeast Transformation Kit.URA + transformants were selected on SD (ura−) agar plates (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids; 2% (w/v) glucose; 0.1 mg/ml each histidine, adenine sulfate, tryptophan, and lysine; and 0.25 mg/ml leucine; 2% bactoagar), and Southern blot analysis was used to confirm gene disruption. Recombinant yeast wild type S-II protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described elsewhere (2Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar). Anti-yeast S-II antiserum was prepared at Asahi Techno Glass Corp. (Chiba, Japan) by injecting a New Zealand White rabbit with 0.3 mg of the purified recombinant yeast S-II protein. Anti-yeast S-II antibodies were affinity-purified from the antiserum as previously described (26Olmsted J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 467-472Google Scholar). YPH499 was transformed with pRS416 (Stratagene), designated TU100, and used as the wild type strain for this experiment. Mutant yeast strains Mt1 to Mt9 were also transformed with pRS416. The resulting nine S-II mutant strains, TU100, and an S-II mull mutant strain HKY01 were separately grown in SD (ura−) medium at 30 °C until they reached midlog phase growth, and then cells were collected by centrifugation. A CellLytic Y solution (Sigma) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A was used to lyse each strain separately. Fifty micrograms of protein from the crude lysate was loaded in each lane of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then blotted to a Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The blot was incubated with affinity-purified anti-yeast S-II antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h and then with anti-rabbit IgG (donkey) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 °C for 1 h. ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. The Kaleidoscope Prestained Standard protein ladder (Bio-Rad) was used to estimate molecular weights. The same yeast strains used in the Western blot analysis were separately incubated in SD (ura−) medium at 30 °C until they reached midlog phase growth, and then 0.18 volume of formaldehyde and 0.13 volume of 1 mpotassium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) were added to the medium. Each culture was incubated at 23 °C for 1 h. Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 0.1 mpotassium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 5% formaldehyde and incubated at 23 °C for 1 h. The cells were then collected by centrifugation and washed once with SHA buffer (1 msorbitol, 0.1 m HEPES-Na, pH 7.2, and 5 mmNaN3) and resuspended in SHA. Cells were then treated with Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and transferred onto ADCELL slides (Erie Scientific Co.; Portsmouth, NH). Cells were fixed in methanol at −20 °C for 6 min and then in acetone at −20 °C for 30 s. Fixed cells were incubated with affinity-purified anti-yeast S-II antibodies or preimmune rabbit IgG followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG (goat) conjugated to the Alexa-488 fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for detection. The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The same yeast strains used in the Western blot analysis were separately incubated in SD (ura−) medium at 30 °C for overnight and then diluted with fresh medium toA 600 = 0.0425. The diluted cultures were incubated until the A 600 reached 0.17 and then diluted 10-, 100-, 1000-, or 10000-fold, and 7 μl of each diluted culture was spotted onto SD (ura−) plates containing 75 μg/ml 6-AU, 25 μg/ml MPA, or no drug. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 4 days. The same yeast strains used in the Western blot analysis were separately incubated in SD (ura−) medium at 30 °C until midlog phase, and then 6-AU to give 75 μg/ml was added. After 0, 0.5, or 2 h, cells were collected by centrifugation, and a hot phenol method (27Kohrer K. Domdey H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 398-405Google Scholar) was used to extract total RNA. Fifteen micrograms of total RNA was loaded onto each lane of an agarose gel containing formaldehyde for Northern blot analysis. The probes were the PCR products amplified from yeast genomic DNA with 5′-GTGGTATGTTGGCCGGTACTACCG-3′ and 5′-TCAGTTATGTAAACGCTTTTCGTA-3′ as primers for IMD2 (22Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Google Scholar) and 5′-TGATAACGGTTCTGGTATGTG-3′ and 5′-TAGTCAGTCAAATCTCTACCG-3′ as primers for actin. The AlkPhos Direct Labeling System with CDP-Star (Amersham Biosciences) was used to label the probes with alkaline phosphatase, and the probes were hybridized with the blots at 55 °C for 16 h. The blots were exposed to x-ray films, and the developed films were scanned with a GS-700 calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad) to quantify the amount of transcript. The signal of the actin mRNA in each sample was used to normalize the band intensity, and the IMD2 signal of the TU100 following a 2-h induction by 6-AU was used as a relative measurement unit. TU100 was transformed with pRS413 (Stratagene) to create TU101. HKY02 was transformed with pRS416 to create TU102. TU101 was used as the wild type strain and TU102 was used as dst1Δin this experiment. Yeast strainsspt4Δand Mt1spt4Δ to Mt9spt4Δ were transformed with pRS413. These strains and dst1Δspt4Δwere separately incubated in SC (ura− his−) medium (0.67% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 0.06% (w/v) complete supplement mixture (−his, −leu, −ura, −trp) from Qbiogene Inc., 0.1 mg/ml each leucine, tryptophan, and lysine, and 0.04 mg/ml adenine sulfate) at 30 °C for 16 h and then diluted toA 600 = 0.085 with YPDA medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) polypeptone, 2% (w/v) glucose, and 0.04 mg/ml adenine sulfate). The diluted cultures were incubated until theA 600 reached 0.17 and then diluted 10-, 100-, 1000-, and 10,000-fold; 7 μl of each culture was then spotted onto YPDA plates. Plates were then incubated at either 30 or 37 °C (restrictive temperature for dst1Δspt4Δ double null mutant) for 5 days. DNA manipulation was performed as described elsewhere (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The method of Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) was used to determine protein concentration; bovine serum albumin was used as a standard. The S. cerevisiae S-II protein consists of three domains: domains I, II, and III. Domains II and III are joined by a short linker region (30Olmsted V.K. Awrey D.E. Koth C. Shan X. Morin P.E. Kazanis S. Edwards A.M. Arrowsmith C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22589-22594Google Scholar). Awrey et al. (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar) constructed a variety of the S. cerevisiae S-II mutant proteins that span domains II and III. They then determined the in vitro cleavage and read-through-stimulating activities of these mutant S-II proteins with an assay that used a human histone H3.3 gene fragment, which contains well characterized transcriptional arrest sites, as the template (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar). To see whether both cleavage and read-through stimulating activities of S-II were responsible for its biologic functions, nine of these mutant S-II proteins, designated Mt1 to Mt9, were selected for further tests. Results from the in vitro assays conducted by Awrey et al. (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar) show that four of the mutant proteins had strong cleavage stimulation but different read-through-stimulating activities (Mt1, -4, -5, and -7); four others (Mt2, -6, -8, and -9) had moderate cleavage stimulation but different read-through-stimulating activities, and Mt3 had little of either activity (Table II). Mt6 has a mutation in domain II, which binds to RNA polymerase II. Mt1, -2, and -7 have mutations in the linker region, and the other mutant proteins have mutations in domain III, which is essential for transcript cleavage and read-through-stimulating activities as well as 6-AU sensitivity suppression (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar, 32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M.

First, Western blot analysis was used to determine the amount of mutant S-II proteins expressed, and indirect immunofluorescence was used to determine the cellular localization of the mutant S-II proteins; both methods used anti-yeast S-II specific antibodies. Results of the Western blot analysis show that all S-II mutant strains have expression patterns similar to that of the wild type strain (Fig.1). In addition to a major band of 42 kDa, which was as large as the recombinant S-II, a faint band (35 kDa) was observed in all strains. Since this signal was not detected in the S-II null mutant HKY01 (Fig. 1), it is thought that the smaller band represents a degradation product of S-II. Results of preliminary studies suggest that the smaller form lacks the carboxyl terminus region 2N. Adachi and T. Nakanishi, unpublished results. that is essential for RNA polymerase II stimulation, read-through stimulation in vitro, and 6-AU sensitivity suppression in vivo (32Nakanishi T. Shimoaraiso M. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8991-8995Google Scholar). The band intensity of the Mt4 S-II protein is reproducibly weaker than the S-II proteins from the other mutant strains (Fig. 1). These data suggest that, compared with the S-II proteins from the other mutant strains, the amount of S-II protein expressed by the Mt4 strain was lower, or the antigenicity of Mt4 S-II protein is weaker. However, it should be noted that results presented below indicate that the amount of Mt4 S-II protein expressed was apparently sufficient to perform its biologic functions (Table II). The results of indirect immunofluorescence experiments to locate S-II are shown in Fig. 2. As shown in Fig.2 A, anti-S-II staining of the wild type strain TU100 showed strong fluorescence that overlapped with nuclear staining, as previously reported (33Albertini M. Pemberton L.F. Rosenblum J.S. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1447-1455Google Scholar). In contrast, no fluorescence was observed in S-II null mutant strain HKY01 stained with anti-S-II (Fig.2 B) or in wild type (Fig. 2 B) and Mt1 to Mt9 (data not shown) cells stained with the same concentration (1.7 μg/ml) of preimmune rabbit IgG. The staining patterns of Mt1 to Mt9 with anti-S-II were indistinguishable from that of the wild type (Fig.2 C) and overlapped with nuclear staining (data not shown). These results indicate that all of the mutant S-II proteins are localized in the nucleus as is the wild type S-II protein. The S. cerevisiae S-II null mutant is known to be sensitive to 6-AU (2Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Google Scholar) and MPA (20Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Google Scholar). To investigate the biologic effects of S-II mutant proteins, the sensitivity of each S-II mutant strain to 6-AU and MPA was tested. Fig. 3 shows that mutant strains Mt1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9 are as resistant to 6-AU as the wild type is; in contrast, Mt3 and Mt8 are as sensitive to 6-AU as is the S-II null mutant. Interestingly, despite its inability to promote read-through in vitro (Table II), Mt5 is as resistant to 6-AU as is the wild type. The sensitivities of mutant strains Mt1 to Mt9 to 25 μg/ml MPA correlate well with the sensitivities to 6-AU (Fig. 3). Additionally, introduction of a centromeric plasmid that contained the S. cerevisiae S-II gene complemented the drug sensitivities of Mt3 and Mt8 (data not shown). These results suggest that the read-through-stimulating activity of S-II is not needed for the suppression of 6-AU and MPA sensitivity. TheIMD2 gene encodes IMP dehydrogenase, a key enzyme in thede novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides (34Kohler G.A. White T.C. Agabian N. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2331-2338Google Scholar). The activity of IMP dehydrogenase is inhibited by MPA and by 6-azauridine monophosphate, an active metabolite of 6-AU (20Exinger F. Lacroute F. Curr. Genet. 1992; 22: 9-11Google Scholar).IMD2 gene transcription can be induced by the addition of 6-AU or MPA to the culture medium (22Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Google Scholar), and this induction depends on S-II. This induction is thought to be important for the development of 6-AU and MPA resistance. Therefore, the ability of 6-AU to induceIMD2 gene transcription in the S-II mutant strains was tested. The wild type TU100 strain, the S-II null mutant HKY01 strain, and the mutant strains Mt1 to Mt9 transformed with pRS416 were incubated in a synthetic medium in the presence or absence of 75 μg/ml 6-AU for up to 2 h, and Northern blot analysis was used to determine the amount of IMD2 mRNA produced by each strain. As shown in Fig. 4, mutant strains Mt1, -2, -4, -5, -6, -7, and -9 induced IMD2 gene expression as well as the wild type strain did, whereas mutant strains Mt3 and Mt8 were as transcriptionally inactive as the S-II null mutant. These data illustrate that the biologic ability to induce theIMD2 gene transcription correlates positively with thein vitro cleavage stimulation activity exhibited by the S-II mutant proteins. SPT4 gene encodes a subunit of the transcription elongation factor DSIF (DRBsensitivity-inducing factor) (35Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Google Scholar). A null mutant of the DST1 gene, which encodes S. cerevisiae S-II, shows temperature sensitivity when combined with the spt4 null mutation, whereas the spt4 null mutant is not temperature-sensitive (17Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Google Scholar). To see whether mutant S-II proteins can suppress the temperature-sensitive phenotype of thedst1Δspt4Δ double null mutant strain, S-II mutant strains carrying the spt4 null mutation were constructed and tested for growth at 37 °C. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Thedst1Δspt4Δ double null mutant strain showed clear temperature sensitivity. Mt1spt4Δ, Mt4spt4Δ, Mt5spt4Δ, Mt7spt4Δ, and Mt9spt4Δ grew as well as spt4Δ at 37 °C, indicating that the Mt1, -4, -5, -7, and -9 S-II mutant proteins suppress temperature sensitivity as well as does the wild type S-II protein. However, the read-through activities of these five S-II mutant proteins vary and do not correlate with their suppression activities. Mt2spt4Δ and Mt6spt4Δ showed moderate temperature sensitivity, indicating that the suppression activities of Mt2 and Mt6 proteins are weaker than that of the wild type S-II protein. Mt3spt4Δ and Mt8spt4Δ were temperature-sensitive, showing that the Mt3 and Mt8 proteins lack suppression activity. These results indicate that the biologic ability to suppress temperature-restricted growth correlates positively with the in vitro cleavage stimulation activities of the S-II mutant proteins. At a transcriptional arrest site in a gene, S-II stimulates the nuclease activity of RNA polymerase II into cleaving several bases from the nascent transcript and causes the realignment of the 3′ end of the nascent transcript with the active site of the polymerase, and the transcription elongation complex tries to read through the arrest site again (11Christie K.R. Awrey D.E. Edwards A.M. Kane C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 936-943Google Scholar, 12Izban M.G. Luse D.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1342-1356Google Scholar, 13Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Google Scholar, 14Reines D. Ghanouni P. Gu W. Mote Jr., J. Powell W. Cell Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 331-338Google Scholar). Results from previous studies have shown that this cleavage stimulation activity of S-II is necessary, but not sufficient, to promote read-through in vitro (15Cipres-Palacin G. Kane C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8087-8091Google Scholar). To clarify this observation, S. cerevisiae S-II mutant strains were used to investigate the roles of the cleavage and read-through stimulation activities of S-II in vivo. A 6-AU sensitivity assay (Fig.3), RNA analysis for IMD2 induction by 6-AU (Fig. 4), and rescue from temperature-dependent growth inhibition of separate strains carrying one of the S-II mutations and anspt4 null mutation (Fig. 5) were used to assess S-II function. The results show that S-II mutant proteins that were active in both cleavage stimulation and read-through in vitro also suppressed 6-AU sensitivity, induced IMD2 gene expression, and suppressed dst1Δspt4Δ temperature-dependent growth inhibition. In contrast, those S-II mutant proteins inactive in vitro did not exhibit any of these biologic functions. Surprisingly, S-II mutant protein Mt5, which has strong cleavage stimulation activity but almost no read-through activity in vitro, performed all biologic functions. Overall, the cleavage-stimulating activities, but not read-through stimulating activities of each mutant S-II protein, corresponded well with their biologic activities. The Mt2, Mt3, Mt6, and Mt8 S-II mutant proteins performed biologic functions not as well as wild type S-II protein (Table II). But the amounts of Mt2, -3, -6, and -8 proteins expressed were as great as the amount of wild type S-II (Fig. 1), and all mutant proteins were localized in the nucleus as the wild type protein was (Fig. 2). Thus, the low biologic activities of Mt2, -3, -6, and -8 S-II mutant proteins were not caused by insufficient protein expression or by cellular mislocalization. These results, summarized in Table II, strongly suggest that the cleavage stimulation activity of S-II alone is responsible for its biologic functions, whereas the read-through stimulation activity of S-II is dispensable. Previously, S-II has been regarded as a transcriptional read-through factor, and its read-through activity has been assumed to be important for its biologic functions; however, the results of the present study do not support this notion. It is possible, however, that the S-II mutant proteins that are inactive in an in vitroread-through assay have sufficient read-through activity in the cell. The results of the present study also imply the presence of some as yet unidentified transcriptional read-through factors. Since the mutant S-II protein Mt5, which lacks read-through activity in vitro, exhibited full biologic activity, it is possible that once the nascent transcript is cleaved by RNA polymerase II, other read-through factors might promote read-through in place of a read-through-incompetent S-II protein in Mt5 strain. Awrey et al. (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar) suggested that a conformational change in the ternary elongation complex (RNA polymerase II-DNA template-nascent transcript) is required for read-through after the cleavage of the nascent transcript. It has been suggested that S-II and Rpb9 influence the conformational change necessary for read-through (31Awrey D.E. Shimasaki N. Koth C. Weilbaecher R. Olmsted V. Kazanis S. Shan X. Arellano J. Arrowsmith C.H. Kane C.M. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22595-22605Google Scholar). Thus, Rpb9 is a good candidate for a read-through factor other than S-II. Mutant yeast strains sensitive to 6-AU that bear the Mt5 mutation may be good tools for identifying this putative read-through factor. Another possible approach would be to use an in vitro read-through assay system containing the S-II Mt5 protein to isolate read-through-promoting factors biochemically. These studies, which are currently under way, are the next logical steps in understanding the regulation of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in eukaryotic cells. We thank Dr. T.

https://openalex.org/W2093224063,"Bacteriophage T4 late promoters, which consist of a simple 8-base pair TATA box, are recognized by the gene 55 protein (gp55), a small, highly diverged member of the ς family proteins that replaces ς70 during the final phase of the T4 multiplication cycle. A 16-amino acid segment of gp55 that is proposed to be homologous to the ς70 region 2.2 has been subjected to alanine scanning and other mutagenesis. The corresponding proteins have been examined in vitro for binding toEscherichia coli RNA polymerase core enzyme and for the ability to generate accurately initiating basal as well as sliding clamp-activated T4 late transcription. Mutations in the amino acid 68–83 segment of gp55 generate a wide range of effects on these functions. The changes are interpreted in terms of the multiple steps of involvement of gp55, like other ς proteins, in transcription. Effects of mutations on RNA polymerase core binding are consistent with the previously proposed homology of amino acids 68–82 of gp55 with ς70 region 2.2 and the recently determined structures of the Thermus thermophilus and Thermus aquaticusς70-RNA polymerase holoenzymes."
