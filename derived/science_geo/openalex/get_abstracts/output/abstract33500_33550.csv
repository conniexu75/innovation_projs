https://openalex.org/W1493414055,"Abstract Recent evidence has demonstrated that there is more than one form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and that these receptors differ in their specificity for the multiple isoforms of PDGF. We present evidence that high affinity binding of PDGF requires association of two different receptor subunits: an alpha-subunit that can bind either a B- or an A-chain of PDGF, and a beta-subunit that can bind only a B-chain. The alpha- and beta-subunits appear to be similar in size but can be distinguished by binding specificity and by an antireceptor monoclonal antibody, PR7212, which recognizes only the beta-subunit. In the absence of PDGF, these subunits either exist separately or form rapidly reversible complexes. In the presence of PDGF, receptor subunits of appropriate specificity interact with a PDGF molecule to form a high affinity complex. Both the absolute and relative numbers of these two PDGF receptor subunits vary on different cell types and correspond to differences in the mitogenic sensitivity of cells to the different PDGF isoforms."
https://openalex.org/W1489423942,"Abstract Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was found to induce dimerization of purified B-type PDGF receptors, as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis after covalent cross-linking using disuccinimidyl suberate. PDGF-BB was 20-fold more effective than PDGF-AB; PDGF-AA was without effect. The dimerization was dose-dependent and was maximal at 0.5-2 micrograms/ml PDGF-BB; at higher concentrations dimerization was less abundant. This indicates that dimerization occurred when one PDGF-BB molecule bound two receptor molecules. The dimerization correlated to activation of the tyrosine kinase of the receptor, determined as autophosphorylation, but was not dependent on phosphorylation reactions because it occurred also in the absence of ATP. Furthermore, dimerization of the receptor correlated with the ability to phosphorylate phosphofructokinase, an exogenous substrate. The complex of ligand and receptor dimer was stable; it resisted electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, as well as gel chromatography. The present data indicate that intermolecular mechanisms are involved in signal transduction from the external ligand binding domain to the internal effector domains of the B-type PDGF receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1486423248,"Sodium nitroprusside is a vasodilator and an inhibitor of platelet activation. It is thought that these effects are mediated by the spontaneous release of nitric oxide and stimulation of cytosolic guanylate cyclase. We have found that sodium nitroprusside (5-200 μM) greatly increased a cytosolic ADP-ribosyltransferase that ADP-ribosylates a soluble 39-kDa protein. This activity causes the mono-ADP-ribosylation of the 39-kDa protein, since digestion with snake venom phosphodiesterase releases 5′-AMP. This enzyme is present in platelets, brain, heart, intestine, liver, and lung. The effect of sodium nitroprusside is not related to stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase and the production of cyclic GMP because cyclic GMP, dibutyryl cyclic GMP, and 8-bromo-cyclic GMP are ineffective. 3-Morpholinosydnonimine (commonly known as SIN-1) (20-1000 μg/ml), another compound that acts through the spontaneous formation of nitric oxide as does sodium nitroprusside, also stimulates ADP-ribosylation of the 39-kDa protein. Hemoglobin, which binds nitric oxide, inhibits sodium nitroprusside's activation of the cytosolic ADP-ribosyltransferase. These studies demonstrate a novel action of nitric oxide related to the activation of an endogenous ADP-ribosyltransferase. The physiological role of this ADP-ribosylation needs further exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2058322547,"DNA replication was studied in a dnaA(Ts) strain containing a plasmid with the dnaA+ gene under plac control. At 42 degrees C, initiation of DNA replication was totally dependent upon the gratuitous inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Flow cytometric measurements showed that at 13% induction of the lac promoter the growth rate, cell size, DNA content, and timing of initiation of DNA replication were indistinguishable from those observed in a wild-type control cell. Higher levels of induction resulted in initiations earlier in the cell cycle and a corresponding increase in the time from initiation to termination. We conclude that the concentration of DnaA protein determines the time of initiation and thereby the initiation mass. With an induction level equal to or above 13%, the synchrony of multiple initiations within one cell was close to that found in a wild-type control cell, showing that a cyclic variation in DnaA content is not necessary for a high degree of synchrony."
https://openalex.org/W2011093920,"We have used two kinds of footprinting techniques, dimethylsulfate interference and hydroxyl radical protection, to explore the way that IHF recognizes its specific target sequences. Our results lead us to conclude that IHF recognizes DNA primarily through contacts with the minor groove, an unprecedented mode for a sequence-specific binding protein. We have also determined that, although IHF is a small protein that protects a large region of DNA, only a single IHF protomer is present at each binding site. IHF bends the DNA to which it binds. We have combined this fact plus our footprinting and stoichiometry data together with the crystal structure of a related protein, the nonspecific DNA binding protein HU, to propose a model for the way in which IHF binds to its DNA target."
https://openalex.org/W1604450112,"Abstract Molecular genetic evidence indicates that there should be three different (Na+ + K+)-stimulated ATPase (Na,K-ATPase) alpha subunit isozymes in the brain where previously only two (alpha and alpha(+)) were resolved as proteins. To detect and identify alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 isozymes, polypeptides made by cell-free translation (Schneider, J.W., Mercer, R.W., Gilmore-Hebert, M., Utset, M.F., Lai, C., Greene, A., and Benz, E.J., Jr. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 85, 284-288) were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and proteolytic fingerprinting. Synthetic alpha 1 comigrated with tissue alpha 1, while alpha 2 and alpha 3 comigrated with the leading and trailing edges, respectively, of tissue alpha(+). Proteolytic fingerprints of newborn rat brain Na,K-ATPase labeled in vivo with L-[35S]methionine indicated the presence of alpha 1 and alpha 3, and a low level of alpha 2. Monoclonal antibodies were characterized by the electrophoretic mobility of their antigens and by their ability to recognize the Na,K-ATPases of kidney, brain, and skeletal muscle. The antibodies were used to assess isozyme expression in the brain. All three isozymes increased in abundance during development from the 18-day fetus to the adult. Small changes were seen in the relative level of expression of alpha 1 and alpha 3 at different developmental ages, while alpha 2 expression increased markedly between the neonate and adult. In adult brain, all three isozymes were found in all brain regions examined. We conclude that all three isozymes are expressed as proteins and that their expression and distribution must be under complex control. No single developmental age or macroscopic brain region provides an exclusive source of any of the isozymes."
https://openalex.org/W1536921936,"The interaction of the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor with a variety of phosphorylated ligands has been studied using equilibrium dialysis and immobilized receptor to measure ligand binding. The dissociation constants for mannose 6-phosphate, pentamannose phosphate, bovine testes beta-galactosidase, and a high mannose oligosaccharide with two phosphomonoesters were 7 X 10(-6) M, 6 X 10(-6) M, 2 X 10(-8) M, and 2 X 10(-9) M, and the mol of ligand bound/mol of receptor monomer were 2.17, 1.85, 0.9, and 1.0, respectively. We conclude that the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor has two mannose 6-phosphate-binding sites/polypeptide chain."
https://openalex.org/W2117047228,"The Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER) genes appear to comprise an interesting subset of class III genes different from any previously identified, including U6 and 7SK. EBER genes have functional A and B box intragenic control regions. In addition, they contain three upstream elements that together stimulate in vivo expression 50-fold and resemble sites associated with typical class II promoters. DNAase I footprinting analyses using purified proteins or oligonucleotide competition demonstrate that nucleotides -40 to -55 bind activating transcription factor (ATF) or a related protein, while nucleotides -56 to -77 bind Sp1 protein or a related protein. The element between positions -23 and -28 resembles a TATA box. EBERs are unusual RNA polymerase III transcripts shown to be controlled by ATF- and Sp1-like promoter elements, suggesting mechanisms for their high level expression in EBV-transformed lymphocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1604527926,"Abstract Diglycerides derived from the phospholipase C-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides are implicated as important mediators of agonist-induced responses, including the stimulation of cell division. alpha-Thrombin-stimulated proliferation of fibroblasts is associated with a sustained increase in cellular diglycerides, while the hydrolysis of phosphoinositides is transient (Wright, T. M., Rangan, L. A., Shin, H. S., and Raben, D. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9374-9380). A rigorous assessment of this apparent discrepancy requires an analysis of the molecular species of the lipids involved. In this report, we have analyzed the molecular species of 1,2-diglycerides present in quiescent and alpha-thrombin-stimulated IIC9 Chinese hamster embryo fibroblasts. The molecular species profiles of the stimulated diglycerides were compared to the profiles of molecular species contained in cellular phospholipids. We demonstrate that 1) stimulation of IIC9 cells by alpha-thrombin results in an increase in the levels of diglyceride molecular species already present in control, quiescent cultures, without the addition of new species or the complete loss of existing species; 2) the diglycerides present in control cultures as well as in cultures stimulated with alpha-thrombin are all ester-linked; and 3) while the phosphoinositides contribute a significant proportion of the diglycerides generated 15 s following alpha-thrombin addition, phosphatidylcholine contributes most of the diglycerides generated after 5 min and 1 h."
https://openalex.org/W1574112238,"Abstract The activity of the membrane-bound and the purified erythrocyte Ca2+-ATPase in the absence of calmodulin was stimulated by calpain digestion but could be further increased to maximal levels by calmodulin (CaM). Thus, CaM sensitivity was retained by the digested ATPase, at least at short times of incubation. In membranes digested at higher temperatures and in the purified ATPase digested at higher calpain/ATPase ratios, the ATPase became fully activated. The membrane-bound and the purified 138-kDa ATPase were converted by calpain to a fragment of approximately 124 kDa which still bound CaM and could be isolated on CaM columns when proteolysis occurred slowly but not when it occurred rapidly. Carboxypeptidase digestion of the purified enzyme and of its fragment of about 124 kDa has shown that calpain attacked the CaM-binding domain near the C terminus of the ATPase. This has also been supported by digestion of the purified enzyme and of its fragment of about 124 kDa. A first cut occurred in the middle of the domain producing a fragment of about 14 kDa and a (CaM-binding) fragment of about 124 kDa. A second cut closer to the N terminus of the domain also produced a fragment of about 124 kDa and accounted for the loss of CaM binding at prolonged times of incubation of the ATPase with calpain."
https://openalex.org/W1611789306,"The transforming protein of polyoma virus, middle T antigen, associates with two cellular enzymes, pp60c-src, a protein tyrosine kinase, and a phosphatidylinositol kinase that forms phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. The formation of a ternary complex of these proteins is essential for complete transformation and maximal tumor induction by the virus. A mutant virus encoding an altered middle T protein that activates pp60c-src but fails to bind phosphatidylinositol kinase is partially defective in transformation. We have confirmed, using an enzymological method, that the product of the in vitro reaction catalyzed by middle T-pp60c-src-phosphatidylinositol kinase complexes is phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), as previously reported (Whitman, M., Downes, C. P., Keeler, M., Keller, T., and Cantley, L. (1988) Nature 332, 644-646). PtdIns(3)P is present in normal as well as virus-infected and transformed cells at levels ranging from 0.6 to 2.6% of the major phosphatidylinositol phosphate isomer, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). Steady-state levels of PtdIns(3)P do not appear to be affected by the expression of middle T in cells. PtdIns(3)P is not hydrolyzed by bovine brain phospholipase C II, which readily cleaves PtdIns(4)P and other phosphatidylinositols. This result underscores the likelihood that the metabolism of PtdIns(3)P is distinct from that of PtdIns(4)P and raises further questions regarding a possible role of PtdIns(3)P in normal and neoplastic cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W1605704996,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces the rapid but transient expression of two transcripts with homology to the proto-oncogene c-jun (AP-1) in PC12 cells. The c-jun transcripts increase within 15 min after NGF addition, peak at 1 h, and decline to basal level by 4 h. Actinomycin D inhibits the increase, and cycloheximide prevents the decrease of c-jun mRNA. Cyclic AMP induces a similar transient rise in c-jun transcripts in PC12 cells. The human melanoma cell line A875 that also expresses the NGF receptor expresses c-jun RNA constitutively, and the level of c-jun RNA is not affected significantly by NGF. NGF does not alter the RNA level of transcription factor SP-1 in PC12 cells. The results suggest that activation of the putative transcription factor c-jun is one of the early cellular responses of PC12 cells to NGF and that c-jun mRNA expression is dependent on cellular transcription and regulated by stabilization of c-jun mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1576930851,"Metabolism of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesteryl ester (CE) by cultured rat adrenal cells was studied. Addition of [3H]CE-HDL to cells pretreated with adrenocorticotrophin in lipoprotein poor media resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent accumulation of [3H]cholesteryl ester and production of [3H]cholesterol and [3H]corticosterone. HDL-CE metabolism could be described as the sum of a high affinity ([ HDL-cholesterol]1/2 max = 16 micrograms/ml) and low affinity ([ HDL-cholesterol]1/2 max greater than 70 micrograms/ml) process. [3H]Cholesterol was found both intracellularly and in the media. Accumulation of [3H]cholesteryl ester could not be attributed to uptake and re-esterification of unesterified cholesterol since addition of Sandoz 58-035, an inhibitor of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, did not prevent ester accumulation. Moreover, addition of chloroquine did not inhibit cholesteryl ester hydrolysis indicating that hydrolysis was not lysosomally mediated. Aminoglutethimide prevented conversion of [3H]CE-HDL to steroid hormones but did not inhibit [3H]cholesteryl ester uptake. Cellular accumulation of [3H] cholesteryl ester exceeded accumulation of 125I-apoproteins 5-fold at 1 h and 35-fold at 24 h indicating selective uptake of cholesteryl ester moiety. We conclude that rat adrenal cells possess a mechanism for selective uptake of HDL cholesteryl esters which provides substrate for steroidogenesis. These results constitute the first direct demonstration that cholesteryl esters in HDL can be used as steroidogenic substrate by the rat adrenal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W1598368675,"The smg-21 GTP-binding protein (smg p21) has the same effector domain as the ras proteins (ras p21s) and is identical with the proteins of the rap1A and Krev-1 genes. In this paper, two proteins stimulating the GTPase activity of smg p21 are partially purified from bovine brain cytosol. These proteins, designated as smg p21 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1 and 2, are separated from a c-ras p21 GAP described previously by column chromatographies. smg p21 GAP1 and −2 stimulate the GTPase activity of only smg p21 but not that of c-Ha-ras p21 or the rho and smg-25A GTP-binding proteins. smg p21 GAP1 or −2 does not stimulate the dissociation of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate or GDP from smg p21. smg p21 GAP1 or −2 themselves do not have GTP/GDP binding or GTPase activity. The Mr values of smg p21 GAP1 and −2 are estimated to be 250−400 × 103 and 80−100 × 103 by gel filtration and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, respectively. The activity of smg p21 GAP1 and −2 is killed by tryptic digestion or heat boiling. These results indicate that bovine brain contains two smg p21 GAPs in addition to c-ras p21 GAP."
https://openalex.org/W113471320,"57Fe-enriched ribonucleotide reductase subunit B2 from Escherichia coli strain N6405/pSPS2 has been characterized by Mossbauer and EPR spectroscopy in its native diferric state and in a new differous form. The native protein exhibits two Mossbauer doublets in a 1:1 ratio with parameters that are in excellent agreement with those reported for the wild-type protein (Atkin, C. L., Thelander, L., Reichard, P., and Lang, G. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 7464-7472); in addition, our studies show the absence of adventitiously bound iron. The iron content in the present samples approached 4 per B2 subunit, and the tyrosyl radical content exceeded 1 per B2 subunit. The higher values are attributed to the use of a new epsilon 280 for the protein and more efficient methods for iron extraction. We thus propose that subunit B2 has two binuclear iron clusters, each associated with its own tyrosyl radical, in contradistinction from the prevailing model. Reduction of the native protein with dithionite or reconstitution of the apoprotein with Fe(II) afforded a protein complex with Mossbauer parameters, delta EQ = 3.13 mm/s and delta = 1.26 mm/s at 4.2 K, and a low field EPR signal associated with an integer spin system. These spectral properties resemble those of methane monooxygenase in its diferrous form. Upon exposure to O2, the reduced subunit B2 readily converts to the diferric state and yields active enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1534064361,"Abstract Membrane-associated phosphatidate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.4) was purified 9833-fold from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The purification procedure included sodium cholate solubilization of total membranes followed by chromatography with DE53, Affi-Gel Blue, hydroxylapatite, Mono Q, and Superose 12. The procedure resulted in the isolation of a protein with a subunit molecular weight of 91,000 that was apparently homogeneous as evidenced by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphatidate phosphatase activity was associated with the purified 91,000 subunit. The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be 93,000 by gel filtration chromatography with Superose 12. Maximum phosphatidate phosphatase activity was dependent on magnesium ions and Triton X-100 at pH 7. The Km value for phosphatidate was 50 microM, and the Vmax was 30 mumol/min/mg. The turnover number (molecular activity) for the enzyme was 2.7 x 10(3) min-1 at pH 7 and 30 degrees C. The activation energy for the reaction was 11.9 kcal/mol, and the enzyme was labile above 30 degrees C. Phosphatidate phosphatase activity was sensitive to thioreactive agents. Activity was inhibited by the phospholipid intermediate CDP-diacylglycerol and the neutral lipids diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol."
https://openalex.org/W1508727703,"The superoxide (O2-)-forming NADPH oxidase of resting macrophages can be activated in a cell-free system by certain anionic amphiphiles, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). O2- production requires the cooperation of membrane-associated and cytosolic components. The membrane component can be solubilized by octyl glucoside yielding a highly active oxidase preparation. High performance gel filtration of the solubilized oxidase on Superose 12 in the presence of 40 mM octyl glucoside leads to the total loss of enzymatic activity. This can be restored in previously inactive eluate fractions by with N-ethylmaleimide or heat (60 degrees C)-inactivated total solubilized membrane. Oxidase activity, that becomes evident upon reconstitution, is eluted from Superose 12 with molecules in the Mr range of 300,000-71,000. The material with reconstitutive capacity is completely dissociated from the oxidase, eluting with molecules in the Mr range of 71,000-11,000. The Superose 12 elution profile of the material responsible for reconstitution coincides with that of membrane-derived phospholipid. Also, the reconstitutive capacity of total solubilized membrane and that of the Mr 71,000-11,000 region of the Superose eluate are recovered in a chloroform extract prepared by the method of Bligh and Dyer. It is concluded that loss of oxidase activity by gel filtration at a high octyl glucoside concentration is the consequence of delipidation. NADPH oxidase activity, revealed by reconstitution of Superose 12 fractions with exogenous phospholipid, correlates closely with the elution profile of cytochrome b559. Reconstitution of activity of delipidated oxidase can also be achieved with natural non-macrophage phospholipids and with synthetic phospholipids. Reconstitution of NADPH oxidase activity by lipids is governed by the following rules: (a) phospholipids are effective; lysophospholipids and neutral lipids are not; (b) phospholipids with polar heads represented by choline, ethanolamine, and serine, as well as cardiolipin, are effective; phosphatidylinositol is much less active; (c) phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acid residues are capable of reconstitution while saturated acyl residues do not confer activity; this specificity appears not to be related to the transition temperature of the phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1555399903,"Using site-directed mutagenesis we have expressed in Escherichia coli three engineered calmodulins (CaM) containing deletions in the solvent-exposed region of the central helix. These are CaM delta 84, Glu-84 removed; CaM delta 83-84, Glu-83 and Glu-84 removed; and CaM delta 81-84, Ser-81 through Glu-84 removed. The abilities of these proteins to activate skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, plant NAD kinase, and bovine brain calcineurin activities were determined, as were their abilities to bind a synthetic peptide based on the calmodulin-binding domain of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. Similar results were obtained with all three deletion proteins. Vm values for enzymes activated by the deletion proteins are all within 10-20% of those values obtained with bacterial control calmodulin. Relative to bacterial control values, changes in Kact or Kd values associated with the deletions are all less than an order of magnitude: Kact values for NAD kinase and myosin light chain kinase are increased 5-7-fold, Kd values for binding of the synthetic peptide are increased 4-7-fold, and Kact values for calcineurin are increased only 1-3-fold. In assays of NAD kinase and myosin light chain kinase activation some differences between bovine calmodulin and bacterial control calmodulin were observed. With NAD kinase, Kact values for the bacterial control protein are increased 4-fold relative to values for bovine calmodulin, and Vm values are increased by 50%; with myosin light chain kinase, Kact values are increased 2-fold and Vm values are decreased 10-15% relative to those values obtained with bovine calmodulin. These differences between bacterial control and bovine calmodulins probably can be attributed to known differences in postranslational processing of calmodulin in bacterial and eucaryotic cells. No differences between bovine and control calmodulins were observed in assays of calcineurin activation or peptide binding. Our observations indicate that contacts with the deleted residues, Ser-81 through Glu-84, are not critical in the calmodulin-target complexes we have evaluated. Formation of these calmodulin-target complexes also does not appear to be greatly affected by the global alterations in the structure of calmodulin that are associated with the deletions. In models in which the central helix is maintained in the altered calmodulins, each deleted residue causes the two lobes of calmodulin to be twisted 100 degrees relative to one another and brought 1.5 A closer together.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1607423446,"The decomposition of organic hydroperoxides as catalyzed by chloroperoxidase was investigated with electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Tertiary peroxyl radicals were directly detected by ESR from incubations of tert-butyl hydroperoxide or cumene hydroperoxide with chloroperoxidase at pH 6.4. Peroxyl, alkoxyl, and carbon-centered free radicals from tertiary hydroperoxide/chloroperoxidase systems were successfully trapped by the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide, whereas alkoxyl radicals were not detected in the ethyl hydroperoxide/chloroperoxidase system. The carbon-centered free radicals were further characterized by spin-trapping studies with tert-nitrosobutane. Oxygen evolution measured by a Clark oxygen electrode was detected for all the hydroperoxide/chloroperoxidase systems. The classical peroxidase mechanism is proposed to describe the formation of peroxyl radicals. In the case of tertiary peroxyl radicals, their subsequent self-reactions result in the formation of alkoxyl free radicals and molecular oxygen. β-Scission and internal hydrogen atom transfer reactions of the alkoxyl free radicals lead to the formation of various carbon-centered free radicals. In the case of the primary ethyl peroxyl radicals, decay through the Russell pathway forms molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1571576266,"We have identified, isolated, and characterized a second inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase enzyme from the soluble fraction of human platelets. The enzyme hydrolyzes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins (1,4,5)P3) to inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (Ins(1,4)P2) with an apparent Km of 24 microM and a Vmax of 25 mumol of Ins(1,4,5)P3 hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein. The enzyme hydrolyzes inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) at a rate of 1.3 mumol of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 hydrolyzed/min/mg of protein with an apparent Km of 7.5 microM. The enzyme also hydrolyzes inositol 1,2-cyclic 4,5-trisphosphate (cIns(1:2,4,5)P3) and Ins(4,5)P2. We purified this enzyme 2,200-fold from human platelets. The enzyme has a molecular mass of 75,000 as determined by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by gel filtration chromatography. The enzyme requires magnesium ions for activity and is not inhibited by calcium ions. The 75-kDa inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase enzyme differs from the previously identified platelet inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase as follows: molecular size (75 kDa versus 45 kDa), affinity for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 (Km 7.5 microM versus 0.5 microM), Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 (24 microM versus 7.5 microM), regulation by protein kinase C, wherein the 45-kDa enzyme is phosphorylated and activated while the 75-kDa enzyme is not. The 75-kDa enzyme is inhibited by lower concentrations of phosphate (IC50 2 mM versus 16 mM for the 45-kDa enzyme) and is less inhibited by Ins(1,4)P2 than is the 45-kDa enzyme. The levels of inositol phosphates that act in calcium signalling are likely to be regulated by the interplay of these two enzymes both found in the same cell."
https://openalex.org/W1585843744,"Abstract Novel metal complexes, Fe(II)-tetrakis-N,N,N',N' (2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine(Fe-TPEN) and Fe(III)-tris[N-(2-pyridylmethyl)-2-aminoethyl]amine (Fe-TPAA), catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide, and 0.8 microM Fe-TPEN and 7.5 microM Fe-TPAA were equivalent to 1 unit of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the xanthine oxidase-cytochrome c assay. Addition of serum albumin had no effect on the activities of Fe-TPEN and Fe-TPAA but depressed those of the Cu(salicylate)2 and Cu(diisopropylsalicylate)2 complexes. Both iron complexes blocked the toxic effect of paraquat on Escherichia coli growth and survival without causing induction of SOD. In contrast, this behavior was not seen with other SOD mimics containing copper or manganese. These results support the view that the SOD activities of these iron complexes remain intact in living cells."
https://openalex.org/W1598399972,"Abstract CTP:phosphacholine cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.15) was purified from rat liver according to the method of Weinhold et al. (Weinhold, P. A., Rounsifer, M. E., and Feldman, D. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5104-5110). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with or without beta-mercaptoethanol revealed a single major band of 42,000 daltons. This band corresponds to the 45-kDa catalytic subunit isolated by Feldman and Weinhold (Feldman, D. A., and Weinhold, P. A. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9075-9081). A minor component of 84,000 daltons was intensified in nonreducing gels when the sulfhydryl reducing agent, dithiothreitol, was removed from the enzyme preparation by dialysis. Reduction with dithiothreitol and electrophoresis in the second dimension showed that this 84-kDa protein was derived from the 42-kDa protein. This result suggested that the 42 kDa protein can be converted to an 84-kDa protein by disulfide bond formation. Reaction with the thiol-cleavable cross-linking reagents, dithiobis(succimidyl propionate) or dimethyl-3,3'-dithiobispropionimidate, converted the 42-kDa cytidylyltransferase subunit into a diffuse band approximately twice its molecular mass. Disulfide reduction and electrophoresis in the second dimension showed that this band was derived exclusively from the 42-kDa subunit. This cross-linking pattern was observed when cytidylyltransferase was bound to a Triton X-100 micelle or when bound to a membrane vesicle containing phosphatidylcholine, oleic acid, and Triton X-100. Reaction of the fully reduced enzyme with glutaraldehyde also generated a cross-linked dimer. All three cross-linking reagents inactivated the enzyme. Reduction of the disulfide cross-linkers with dithiothreitol partially reactivated the transferase. When Triton was removed from the enzyme preparation by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography, reaction of the detergent-depleted enzyme with glutaraldehyde generated a band corresponding to a hexamer and higher molecular weight aggregates. The dimeric form was regenerated by addition of either Triton X-100 or phosphatidylcholine-oleic acid vesicles. We conclude that the purified, native cytidylyltransferase, when bound to a detergent micelle or membrane vesicle, is a dimer composed of two noncovalently linked 42-kDa subunits. In the absence of a membrane or micelle, the dimers self-aggregate in a reversible manner."

Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography revealed several kinds of methylated bases in DNAs of both photosynthetic cell types, with the largest amounts in fully green leaves. The occurrence of selective DNA methylation was investigated by employing an isoschizomeric pair of methyl-sensitive and -insensitive endonucleases followed by Southern hybridizations with specific DNA probes. Notably, there was an inverse correlation between the relative abundance of specific transcripts in a given cell type during greening and the methylation status of the corresponding nuclear or chloroplast gene. Furthermore, a heterologous in vitro transcription system using Escherichia coli RNA polymerase revealed that the plastid gene encoding the RBUp2Case large subunit in both cell types was active as a template in the unmethylated state, whereas it was inactive when methylated. Thus, the selective methylation of both chloroplast and nuclear DNA is likely one component of a multilevel control mechanism for the differential regulation of cell-specific C4 photosynthesis gene expression in greening maize leaves."
https://openalex.org/W1551037687,"Addition of protein kinase C activators to electropermeabilized frog rod photoreceptors enhances the phosphorylation of proteins with molecular masses of 54, 24, 19, 17, 12, and 11 kDa. The latter two correspond to components I and II, which are also phosphorylated by cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase. Stimulation of phosphorylation by the protein kinase C activator oleoylacetylglycerol (OAG) is half-maximal at 7.7 microM OAG and is reduced by the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7. In contrast with earlier observations, no effects of calcium, calmodulin, or insulin on protein phosphorylations are observed. We find evidence for only three protein kinases in rod outer segments: a protein kinase C-like activity, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and rhodopsin kinase. With the exception of components I and II, the substrate proteins for each kinase are distinct. Treatment of intact rods with OAG decreases the amplitude of the photoresponse and dark levels of cGMP up to 40%, as well as depressing the light-stimulated decrease in cGMP levels. These effects are observed between 0.1 and 1 microM OAG. The data suggest that OAG-sensitive reactions may modulate pathways that support the light response."
https://openalex.org/W1626869678,"Abstract Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger which induces Ca2+ release from an intracellular store. We have investigated the properties of the [32P]IP3 binding sites in rat liver. Two specific [32P]IP3 receptors with KD of 2.3 and 88 nM and respective capacities of 33 fmol/mg protein and 195 fmol/mg protein have been detected in a crude membrane fraction prepared from rat liver homogenate. The pretreatment of the liver with IP3-dependent hormones increased two-fold the capacity of the high affinity site. This effect was partly reversed by dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Permeabilized hepatocytes also displayed two [32P]IP3 binding sites with KD of 1.5 and 84 nM and respective capacities of 8 and 300 fmol/10(6) cells. We have measured the [32P]IP3 binding and the IP3-induced 45Ca2+ release in the same batch of permeabilized hepatocytes. In a low Mg2+ medium, the EC50 for 45Ca2+ release was in close correlation with the KD for the low affinity site. These data suggest that an equilibrium between two states of the IP3 receptor is regulated by hormone action and the low affinity state is responsible for the intracellular Ca2+ release."
https://openalex.org/W4166267,"The amino-terminal thrombolytic fragment (residues 1-191) of human apolipoprotein (apo) E was previously shown to be fully active in binding to the low density lipoprotein receptor. In this study, truncated apoE variants with progressive deletions at the carboxyl terminus were produced in Escherichia coli by linker-insertion mutagenesis to define the minimum amino-terminal structure necessary for full receptor binding. These truncated forms of apoE, comprising residues 1-166, 1-170, 1-174, or 1-183, were combined with the phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and tested for their ability to bind to low density lipoprotein receptors on human fibroblasts. All of the truncated variants formed typical discoidal particles when combined with the phospholipid, and the particles could be isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. The 1-166 and 1-170 variants had very little receptor binding activity (1%), whereas the 1-183 variant had nearly full activity (85%). The 1-174 variant had 19% activity. We conclude that the 171-183 region of apoE is important for receptor binding, either by contributing one or more residues essential for receptor binding or, more likely, by stabilizing or aligning the region known to be crucial for receptor binding, in the vicinity of residues 140-160."
https://openalex.org/W1530257476,"The characteristics and physiological relevance of the high density lipoprotein (HDL) binding site on unstimulated and mitogen activated human peripheral blood lymphocytes have been investigated. At 37 °C, specific binding/uptake of fluorescent (dioctadecylin-docarbocyanine, DiI) HDL was observed by cells from healthy donors as well as by those from low density lipoprotein receptor-defective patients; mitogen activated T-blasts exhibited a markedly elevated DiI-HDL uptake compared to resting T-cells. Binding was saturable at 37 °C and of high affinity, with a Kd of 5 × 10−8 M. It was blocked by anti-apoAI polyclonal antibodies (F(ab)2 fraction), but not by anti-apolipoprotein (apo)E, anti-apoAII, or anti-apoB, and was inhibited competitively by HDL apoproteins and an apoAI-protein A fusion protein. T-cell associated DiI-HDL was increased by trypsin treatment (of the cells) and decreased by activation in the presence of HDL or low density lipoprotein. Comparison of the concentration dependencies of growth promotion and specific cell association of HDL indicated that two mechanisms of lipid exchange may be in operation: one a binding-dependent mechanism of cholesterol exchange, with maximal effect in the HDL concentration range (20-200 μg/ml) in which specific binding increases rapidly, and the other a binding-independent exchange of lipids effective at concentrations in which specific binding is saturated (300-5000 μg/ml)."
https://openalex.org/W1559682060,"Abstract The reduction of bovine heart cytochrome oxidase by the 1-methylnicotinamide (MNA) radical was investigated by the use of pulse radiolysis. With the decay of the MNA radical, the absorption at 445 and 605 nm, a characteristic to ferrous heme a of the oxidase, increased. The kinetic difference spectrum obtained was similar to that of the fully reduced minus the fully oxidized form of the oxidase, and was not different from that obtained in the reaction of the MNA radical with the mixed valence CO complex of the oxidase, where heme a3 is the CO-bound reduced form with heme a oxidized. This suggests that the absorption changes at 445 and 605 nm arise from the reduction of heme a, not heme a3. In order to elucidate the contribution of copper in this reaction, the absorption of the oxidase in the near-infrared region was measured. A decrease of the 830 nm band due to the reduction of visible copper was detected with a half-life of 5 microseconds. This absorption change obeyed pseudo-first order kinetics and its rate constant increased with the concentration of the oxidase. This suggests that the absorption change at 830 nm is followed by a bimolecular reaction of the MNA radical with visible copper of the oxidase. After the first phase of the reduction, the return of the 830 nm band corresponding to oxidation of the copper was observed with a half-life of 100 microseconds. Concomitantly, the absorption at 605 and 445 nm due to the reduction of heme a increased. The rates of oxidation of the copper were identical to those of the reduction of heme a and independent of the oxidase concentration. This suggests that the MNA radical reacts with visible copper of the oxidase with a second order rate constant of 1.5 X 10(9) m-1 s-1 and subsequently the electron flows to heme a by intramolecular electron migration with a first order rate constant of 1.8 X 10(4) s-1. An activation energy of the intramolecular electron transfer was calculated to be 2.8 kcal/mol in the range 4-33 degrees C."

https://openalex.org/W1559495651,"Binding of ligands to the active site Fe3+ of protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase is investigated using EPR-detected transferred hyperfine coupling from isotopically labeled substrates, inhibitors, and cyanide. Broadening is observed in EPR resonances from the anaerobic enzyme complex with homoprotocatechuate (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate), a slow substrate, enriched with 17O (I = ½) in either the 3-OH or the 4-OH group. This shows that this substrate binds directly to the Fe3+ and strongly suggests that an iron chelate can be formed. Cyanide is known to bind to the enzyme in at least two steps, forming first a high spin and then a low spin complex (Whittaker, J. W., and Lipscomb, J. D. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 4487–4495). Hyperfine broadening from [13C]cyanide (I = ½) is observed in the EPR spectra of both complexes, showing that cyanide is an Fe3+ ligand in each case. Cyanide binding is also at least biphasic in the presence of protocatechuate (PCA). The initial high spin enzyme-PCA-cyanide complex forms rapidly and exhibits a unique EPR spectrum. Broadening from PCA enriched with 17O in either the 3-OH or the 4-OH group is detected showing that PCA binds to the iron, probably as a chelate complex. In contrast, no broadening from [13C]cyanide is detected for this complex suggesting that cyanide binds at a site away from the Fe3+. Steady state kinetic measurements of cyanide inhibition of PCA turnover are consistent with two rapidly exchanging cyanide binding sites that inhibit PCA binding and which can be simultaneously occupied. Formation of the nearly irreversible, low spin enzyme-PCA-cyanide complex is competitively inhibited by PCA. Transient kinetics of the formation of this complex are second order in cyanide implying that two cyanides bind. Broadening in the EPR spectrum of this complex is detected from [13C]cyanide, but not from [17O]PCA, suggesting that PCA is displaced. This study provides the first direct evidence for chelation of the active site Fe3+ by substrates and for a small molecule binding site away from the iron in intradiol dioxygenases."
https://openalex.org/W1566341472,"The β-globin genes from a Thai patient compound heterozygous for β-thalassemia and HbE disease were investigated. The 3.0-kilobase fragment containing the entire β-globin gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, using Taq DNA polymerase followed by direct cloning of the amplified product into plasmid DNA. Sequence analysis of the thalassemia gene revealed only one base change, a C-A transversion within codon for an amino acid 35. This new mutation creates a premature terminator, TAA, an ochre codon, and results in a β0-thalassemia phenotype. The same result was obtained when this mutation was analyzed using a conventional cloning technique, direct sequencing of the amplified product, and hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes. No misincorporation was detected in the sequence analysis of the 3.0-kilobase insert of five clones of the amplified products obtained from genomic DNA of a normal individual. This approach is a rapid and accurate method for molecular cloning of the β-globin gene and also other genes, the partial nucleotide sequences of which are known."
https://openalex.org/W1584755624,"Abstract A particulate form of protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase was solubilized and purified over 2,000-fold from the particulate fraction of rat spleen. Phosphorylated poly(Glu, Tyr), a random copolymer of glutamic acid and tyrosine, was used as substrate for measuring protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. Nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 increased the protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity of the particulate fraction (but not of the soluble fraction) by 4-8-fold. Chromatography of the Triton extract of the particulate fraction on DEAE-Sephacel gave three peaks of protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity. The major peak of activity was further purified on Bio-Gel HTP, Sephadex G-75, and phosphocellulose columns. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of Na-dodecyl-SO4 the purified enzyme showed a major protein band of Mr 36,000 which comigrated with enzyme activity on the phosphocellulose column. The apparent Vmax and Km for phosphorylated poly(Glu,Tyr) were 6,150 nmol min-1 mg-1 and 1.6 microM, respectively. This enzyme was strongly inhibited by microM concentrations of orthovanadate and zinc acetate. Fluoride (50 mM) inhibited this enzyme only by 30-40%. Divalent metal ions Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+ were inhibitory at 1-10 mM concentration. EDTA had no effect on the activity of the purified enzyme. This phosphatase could dephosphorylate and inactivate the phosphorylated form of a tyrosine-specific protein kinase (TK-I) previously purified from rat spleen. Dephosphorylation and inactivation of TK-I by purified phosphatase were inhibited by orthovanadate. After dephosphorylation and inactivation by phosphatase, TK-I could be rephosphorylated and reactivated on incubation with ATP. These results suggest that this protein-phosphotyrosine phosphatase may be involved in the regulation of the kinase activity of TK-I."
https://openalex.org/W1489768032,"Abstract By using an in vitro system for R1 plasmid replication dependent on a plasmid-encoded repA protein and host dnaA protein, 5' ends of the nascent leading strand were located at positions 1986-1992, some 380 base pair downstream of oriR. Analyses of early replication intermediates generated in vitro in the presence of dideoxy TTP also indicated that replication initiates about 400 base pair downstream of oriR and proceeds unidirectionally. When a 418-base single-stranded DNA from position 1778 to 2195, derived from the leading strand template, was cloned onto an M13 vector, the chimeric single-stranded phage could be replicated in vitro with only single-stranded DNA binding protein, primase (dnaG gene product), and DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Furthermore, the priming occurred at a site identical to leading strand initiation. These results strongly suggest that the leading strand synthesis is primed by primase alone. The lagging strand synthesis is specifically terminated at position 1515 or 1516 within oriR, preventing further leftward fork movement. Based on these results, a scheme of R1 plasmid replication is presented."

We show here that NEP is expressed on rabbit synovial fibroblasts and on simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA- and H-ras-transformed rabbit mammary epithelial cells. Treatment of these cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) for 24 h decreased expression of NEP mRNA transcripts and decreased the biosynthetically labeled immunoprecipitable NEP antigen. In contrast to its effects on NEP, TPA treatment induced expression of the secreted metalloproteinase collagenase and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. TPA induced stromelysin, another secreted metalloproteinase, only in the fibroblasts. These data provide evidence that the expression of the membrane-bound NEP is regulated in several cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1889965948,"The binding of mRNA to bovine mitochondrial ribosomes was investigated using triplet codons, homopolymers and heteropolymers of various lengths, and human mitochondrial mRNAs. In the absence of initiation factors and initiator tRNA, mitochondrial ribosomes do not bind triplet codons (AUG and UUU) or homopolymers (oligo(U] shorter than about 10 nucleotides. The RNA binding domain on the 28 S mitoribosomal subunit spans approximately 80 nucleotides of the mRNA, judging from the size of the fragments of poly(U,G) and natural mRNAs protected from RNase T_1 digestion by this subunit, but the major binding interaction with the ribosome appears to occur over a 30-nucleotide stretch. Human mitochondrial mRNAs coding for subunits II and III of cytochrome c oxidase and subunit 1 of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) were used in studying in detail the binding of mRNA to the small subunit of bovine mitochondrial ribosomes. We have determined that these mRNAs have considerable secondary structure in their 5'-terminal regions and that the initiation codon of each mRNA is sequestered in a stem structure. Little mRNA was bound to ribosomes in a manner conferring protection of the 5' termini from RNase T_1 digestion, under standard conditions supporting the binding of artificial templates, but such binding was greatly stimulated by the addition of a mitochondrial extract. Initiation factors and tRNAs from Escherichia coli were unable to stimulate the 5' terminus protected binding of these mRNA molecules, demonstrating a requirement for homologous factors. Our results strongly suggest that mitochondrial initiation factors are required for the proper recognition and melting of the secondary structure in the 5'-terminal region of mitochondrial mRNAs, as a prerequisite for initiation of protein synthesis in mammalian mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1912149482,"Elementary Na+ currents through single cardiac Na+ channels were recorded at 19 degrees C in patch clamp experiments with cultured neonatal rat cardiocytes. The metabolites of the glycolytic pathway, 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and glyceraldehyde phosphate, were identified as a novel class of modulators of Na+ channel activity. In micromolar concentrations (1-10 mumol/liter), their presence at the cytoplasmic membrane face increased the number of sequential openings during depolarization and prolonged the conductive channel state. As found after ensemble averaging, the decay kinetics of reconstructed macroscopic Na+ currents became retarded and slow Na+ inactivation may have been evoked. Both metabolites attenuated the rundown of channel activity that regularly develops after patch excision in the inside-out patch configuration. It is tempting to assume that interference with Na+ inactivation is the mode of action underlying the increase in single-channel activity."
https://openalex.org/W1905557499,"Antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used in immunoprecipitation experiments to determine if post-translational modification of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor was required for the acquisition of ligand-induced tyrosine kinase activity. In intact Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts, only the fully processed 180-kDa receptor was activated (tyrosine-phosphorylated) by PDGF. In a cell-free assay, however, the tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of the 160- and 145-kDa PDGF receptor precursors were also detected. These activated precursors were immunoprecipitated after brief (5-15 min) metabolic labeling periods. Thus the receptor could bind PDGF and induce tyrosine kinase activity shortly after translation. Unlike the mature form of the receptor, the 160-kDa receptor precursor was resistant to digestion with endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase and thus did not contain O-linked oligosaccharides. Since this receptor precursor was activated by PDGF in the cell-free assay, the addition of O-linked sugars must not be necessary for ligand binding activity. Incubation of cells with tunicamycin completely inhibited N-linked glycosylation of the PDGF receptor. Nevertheless, PDGF still induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the 130-kDa aglycoreceptor in lysates of tunicamycin-treated cells. Thus, the addition of N-linked oligosaccharides was also not required for receptor activation. These findings show that the PDGF receptor acquired the ability to be activated by ligand cotranslationally or immediately after translation and that the addition of N- or O-linked oligosaccharides was not required for ligand binding and tyrosine kinase activities."

From the spectroscopic characteristics reported for the enzyme forms, a mechanistic role for PQQ could be deduced. In analogy with other quinoproteins, the initial formation of a PQQ-substrate adduct is proposed. Following internal hydrogen transfer, leading to aldehyde product and reduced pyrroloquinoline quinone, reoxidation of the organic cofactor with molecular oxygen could be mediated by the PQQ-liganded copper ion with concomitant formation of hydrogen peroxide. With PQQ as an additional (two-electron) redox center the occurrence of a superoxidized enzyme form must be considered. Possible consequences of this view, in relation to a physiological function of the enzyme and interpretation of ESR data, are discussed."

On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified preparation gave a single band of approximately 84 kDa. Analysis of protein blot with antibodies specific for the light and heavy chains of myeloperoxidase indicated that the enzyme contained a light and a heavy chain in a single polypeptide. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme began at amino acid residue 155 of the 745-amino acid sequence predicted from myeloperoxidase cDNA, indicating that the enzyme consisted of 591 amino acids. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the enzyme showed that the enzyme was a monomeric form. In pulse-chase experiments on HL-60 cells with [35S]methionine, pulse-labeled myeloperoxidase precursors were shown to be processed to a light chain and a heavy chain of cellular enzyme. During a 3-day chase period, newly formed processed monomeric enzyme was converted to a dimeric form."
https://openalex.org/W1583031456,"Abstract Anti-insulin receptor monoclonal antibody MA-10 inhibits insulin receptor autophosphorylation of purified rat liver insulin receptors without affecting insulin binding (Cordera, R., Andraghetti, G., Gherzi, R., Adezati, L., Montemurro, A., Lauro, R., Goldfine, I. D., and De Pirro, R. (1987) Endocrinology 121, 2007-2010). The effect of MA-10 on insulin receptor autophosphorylation and on two insulin actions (thymidine incorporation into DNA and receptor down-regulation) was investigated in rat hepatoma Fao cells. MA-10 inhibits insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation, thymidine incorporation into DNA, and insulin-induced receptor down-regulation without affecting insulin receptor binding. We show that MA-10 binds to a site of rat insulin receptors different from the insulin binding site in intact Fao cells. Insulin does not inhibit MA-10 binding, and MA-10 does not inhibit insulin binding to rat Fao cells. Moreover, MA-10 binding to down-regulated cells is reduced to the same extent as insulin binding. In rat insulin receptors the MA-10 binding site has been tentatively localized in the extracellular part of the insulin receptor beta-subunit based on the following evidence: (i) MA-10 binds to insulin receptor in intact rat cells; (ii) MA-10 immunoprecipitates isolated insulin receptor beta-subunits labeled with both [35S]methionine and 32P; (iii) MA-10 reacts with rat insulin receptor beta-subunits by the method of immunoblotting, similar to an antipeptide antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the insulin receptor beta-subunit. Moreover, MA-10 inhibits autophosphorylation and protein-tyrosine kinase activity of reduced and purified insulin receptor beta-subunits. The finding that MA-10 inhibits insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation and reduces insulin-stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA and receptor down-regulation suggests that the extracellular part of the insulin receptor beta-subunit plays a role in the regulation of insulin receptor protein-tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W224004246,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) regulates pituitary gonadotropin release by a Ca2+-dependent mechanism involving receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Previous studies indicate that activation of pituitary protein kinase C (PKC), while not required for acute gonadotropin release in response to GnRH, is likely involved in the chronic regulation of gonadotrope responsiveness. Studies from our laboratory have shown that activation of PKC by phorbol esters produces both the uncoupling of GnRH-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the selective enhancement of GnRH agonist binding in pituitary cell cultures. In the present work, we have examined the possibility that these processes are related in mechanism. Dissociation of bound agonist radioligand at 23 degrees C was found to be reduced in the presence of phorbol esters, and ligand bound in the presence of phorbol ester was resistant to displacement by competing ligands at 4 degrees C. However, agonist bound in the presence of phorbol ester was dissociable by subsequently washing cells at pH 3. Receptor photoaffinity labeling studies confirmed that agonist association with membrane component(s) identified as the GnRH receptor was increased in the presence of phorbol ester. These results suggest that, in the presence of a phorbol ester PKC activator, agonist-occupied GnRH receptors remain at the cell surface, but are sequestered in some manner. In other experiments, cell preloaded with [3H]inositol were treated with GnRH agonist ligand and phorbol ester at 4 degrees C to form a pool of sequestered, agonist-occupied receptors, and then displaceable (nonsequestered) agonist was removed by incubation with antagonist ligand. After addition of LiCl and warming to 37 degrees C, [3H]inositol phosphate production (an index of phosphoinositide hydrolysis) in phorbol ester-treated cells was reduced to 67% of vehicle control, although residual specific agonist binding had been increased to greater than 300% of control. The appearance of sequestered receptors and inhibition of [3H]inositol phosphate production had similar phorbol ester concentration dependencies. These results suggest that the same agonist-occupied GnRH receptors sequestered as a result of PKC activation also are preferentially uncoupled from phosphoinositide hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1499106254,"Protein fragments have been activated by the addition of amino acid esters using proteolytic enzymes under conditions where the equilibria are shifted in the direction of synthesis. Because of the natural propensity of large protein fragments to form complexes approximating native conformation, these activated fragments have been induced to recombine by formation of the missing peptide bond. Although the incorporated ester is only weakly activating, the complex, mimicking an enzyme, provides proximity and orientation at the reacting termini, so that coupling yields are high. In other words, the protein catalyzes its own resynthesis. What distinguishes our technique from the rare natural examples of this phenomenon is that it operates at a variety of cleavage sites and with varying chain lengths. There seems to be no particular limitations on the amino acid esters that can be added, and serine proteases with a wide range of specificities can be used. It thus appears that we have a truly general method for the condensation of large fragments in protein synthesis, be they natural or the products of synthetic or genetic methods. This approach has the advantages over conventional methods of great specificity, high efficiency, and mild conditions of use. With our model protein, cytochrome c, we have used this approach to make analogues that illuminate structure-function relations. Both the highly conserved lysine 39 and the functionally invariant threonine 40 have been replaced by a range of substitutions. The results show how crucial these residues are to the structural and functional integrity of the bottom omega-loop of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1494643358,"Abstract The segment inversion site of herpes simplex virus type 1 contains a series of tandem repeats with a purine bias on one strand and high G + C content (DR2 repeats) capable of adopting a non-B-DNA structure under a variety of conditions. Plasmids carrying eight contiguous copies of DR2 sequences undergo a series of supercoil-driven conformational transitions resulting in different extents of relaxation at pH 5.0. These transitions depend on the presence of an appropriate concentration of divalent cations (Mg2+ and Ca2+) which seem to interact specifically with the alternate structure(s). The transitions occurred at approximately the same superhelical density for all lengths of inserts studied. However, the onset of the transition can be shifted to lower negative superhelical densities by increasing NaCl concentrations. This leads to a reduction of the cooperativity of the transition, which takes place over a range of linking isomers under these conditions. Extrapolating from these results, we established physiological conditions where the alternate DNA structure is found at negative superhelical densities as low as -0.035. The existence of non-B-DNA conformations and/or the structural transitions of these sequences located in this region of intense biological activity implies their involvement in the life cycle of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W1617344177,"Abstract Evidence for the production of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) during the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed decomposition of ethyl hydroperoxide has been obtained through the use of optical spectroscopy, oxygen electrode experiments, and electron spin resonance (ESR). ESR spin-trapping experiments with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) demonstrate the production of the ethyl peroxyl free radical during the chloroperoxidase/ethyl hydroperoxide reaction. Oxygen and acetaldehyde concentrations suggest that the production of ethyl peroxyl radicals constitutes less than 2% of the decomposition of ethyl hydroperoxide at the concentrations of reactants used. The phosphorescence of 1O2 at 1268 nm was observed during the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed decomposition of ethyl hydroperoxide in deuterium oxide buffer. Chloroperoxidase also catalyzes the decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide to its corresponding peroxyl radical. Alkoxyl and alkyl-DMPO spin adducts were also detected. A much lower yield of 1O2 phosphorescence was observed during the chloroperoxidase-catalyzed decomposition of tert-butyl hydroperoxide. This phosphorescence probably arises through secondary production of alkyl peroxyl radicals. These results suggest that the initial enzyme-dependent production of ethyl peroxyl radicals is followed by enzyme-independent reaction of two peroxyl radicals through the tetroxide intermediate, as originally proposed by Russell (Russell, G. A. (1957) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79, 3871-3877), to form acetaldehyde, ethyl alcohol, and molecular oxygen."
https://openalex.org/W1566169662,"Abstract Analyses of apolipoprotein II mRNA with chemical and enzymatic probes showed that double- and single-stranded regions were distributed uniformly along the mRNA except for a large (72 nucleotides) single-stranded region containing the translation stop codon. Secondary structure models constrained by the experimental data were made by varying the distance (along the mRNA) over which base pairing was allowed. Four prominent secondary structures were seen with restrictions of 165, 330, or 659 nucleotides suggesting that such structures from via local interactions over distances of 50-120 nucleotides. Predicted long range interactions involve only 2-3 base pairs while local interactions involve helices of 4-10 base pairs. Predicted helices of greater than or equal to 4 base pairs occur primarily within exons, raising the possibility that prominent secondary structures in mRNAs may be largely due to intraexonic base pairing. Tests of single- and double-stranded domains by oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage and primer extension were in accord with the structure model and with nuclease and chemical modification data. The model predicting base pairing between the coding and the 3' noncoding regions was tested by RNase H cleavage followed by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography to separate 5' and 3' mRNA fragments. Most (82%) of the 5' fragment remained associated with the 3' noncoding region in a structure with a tm = 50 degrees C in 0.2 M Na+ suggesting that this stem could be stable in vivo. This stem may be stable in the isolated mRNA, but would likely occur transiently in polyribosomal apolipoprotein II mRNA due to ribosome transit through the 5' side of the stem. Alternate structures may occur in this region during ribosome transit and play a role in translation termination or in determining the susceptibility of the mRNA to degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1585202292,"Abstract The photoaffinity reagent 8-azido-2'-O-[14C]dansyl-ATP (AD-ATP) has been synthesized for labeling and monitoring the active sites of ATPases and kinases. In its first application, the reagent is used to explore the active site of adenylate kinase from rabbit muscle. In the dark, AD-ATP inhibits adenylate kinase reversibly and competitively with KI = 0.25 +/- 0.01 microM. Under weak UV illumination, AD-ATP labels adenylate kinase irreversibly. The photoinactivation data also show KI = 0.25 +/- 0.02 microM. The ratio (r) of the specific activity of AD-ATP-labeled adenylate kinase to that of the unlabeled enzyme has been determined as a function of the number (n) of label/enzyme. The linear plot of r versus n with slope equal to -1 shows that the labeling is very specific, i.e. each label completely inactivates an enzyme molecule. After the labeled enzyme was partially hydrolyzed and the radioactive peptides analyzed and sequenced, it was found that Leu-115, Cys-25, and probably His-36 were labeled, in agreement with previous conclusions on the structure of the active site of this enzyme based on amino acid sequence, x-ray diffraction, and NMR studies. The environment-sensitive fluorescent dansyl group of AD-ATP can function as an in situ probe for monitoring ligand or conformation changes at the active site. The fluorescence of AD-ATP-labeled enzyme with n = 0.9 is not affected by ATP but increases with the concentration of AMP in solution. This observation is also in agreement with the previous conclusion that ATP does not bind to the AMP site of adenylate kinase. The observed enhancement of fluorescence indicates that binding of AMP by this enzyme causes environmental change at its ATP site. The possible usefulness of AD-ATP as an effective biological inhibitor or as a molecular probe for studying the structure and regulation of ATP-binding proteins is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1530964248,"Abstract F9 mouse teratocarcinoma and PyS-2 cells in culture incubated with monovalent cations in buffered sucrose solution (0.25 M) can secrete as much as 40% of their total lysosomal enzymes into the medium within 30 min. Longer incubation does not lead to further loss of enzyme, suggesting that only a certain fraction of lysosomes is capable of discharge. The simultaneous presence of sucrose and cation, each at the respective optimal concentrations of 0.25 and 0.15 M, is required for lysosomal discharge (i.e. twice isoosmolarity). The cells remain fully viable. Sodium ions are more effective than lithium and potassium ions, whereas amines and divalent cations are less effective. Other sugars including glucose can replace sucrose to varying extents. Secretion is accompanied by a rapid short-lived rise in the level of cAMP. Forskolin as well as agents that activate G protein such as cholera toxin, AlF4-, and vanadate ions also increase the rate of secretion. Sucrose-Na+ stimulation takes place independently of changes in influx or efflux of calcium ions or changes in the levels of extracellular or free intracellular calcium ions. Neomycin, an inhibitor of phospholipase C, has little effect on secretion. Our results suggest that the secretion observed is mediated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism involving G proteins. Calcium ions and phospholipase C appear to play little or no part in the activation process."
https://openalex.org/W1509574321,"Abstract The fluorescent ATP analogue 8-azido-2'-O-[14C]dansyl-ATP ([ 14C]AD-ATP) was used to probe the ATP-binding site in the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. AD-ATP was found to inhibit the phosphotransferase activity of C subunit with extremely high specificity. Complete inhibition was observed when each mol of C subunit was covalently labeled with 1 mol of this fluorescent ATP analogue. The labeling can be accelerated by the presence of Mg2+ or Kemptide (Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly), whereas high concentrations of ATP can almost completely protect the enzyme from AD-ATP. Detailed studies indicated that AD-ATP competes with ATP for binding to C subunit. Analysis of the kinetic data gave dissociation constants of 2.9 and 13 microM for AD-ATP and ATP bound to C subunit, respectively. AD-ATP has a fluorescence emission peak at 510 nm in pH 7.0 aqueous buffer containing 25% glycerol. After covalent binding to C subunit this emission peak shifts to 455 nm, which suggests that the label at ATP site is in an endogenous hydrophobic environment. Upon the binding of Mg2+ or Kemptide, the fluorescence of AD-ATP-labeled C subunit can be enhanced by 50 and 45%, respectively. This enhancement suggests that the binding of either the peptide substrate or Mg2+ induces conformational change at the active site of C subunit. Analysis of the fluorescence data shows that the values of Kd for Mg2+ and Kemptide bound to AD-ATP-labeled C subunit are 0.2 mM and 2.1 microM, respectively. The normal procedure for the preparation of the C subunit from the bovine heart muscle has been simplified to require only one-fifth of the usual working time to obtain the homogeneous enzyme with 70% yield from the crude extract."
https://openalex.org/W274872353,"Abstract Two forms of rat liver aryl hydrocarbon receptor were separated by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose in the presence of molybdate. After labeling for 2 h at 0 degrees C, the receptor separated on the DEAE column into a flow-through peak (peak I) and a peak eluting at 80 mM KCl (peak II). It had been reported previously that exposure to high salt in the presence of molybdate caused the appearance of both 9 and 5-6 S receptor forms. After confirming this, I examined the relationship of the peak I and peak II receptors to these receptor forms. In high salt buffer containing molybdate, the peak I receptor sedimented in the 5-6 S region and the peak II receptor at 9 S. High salt buffer lacking molybdate converted both peak I and peak II receptors to forms sedimenting in the 5-6 S region. In low salt buffer containing molybdate, the peak I receptor sedimented at slightly more than 7 S and the peak II receptor at 9-10 S. Thus, the peak II receptor could be stabilized by molybdate as a 9 S form, and the peak I receptor was converted by high salt from a 7 to a 5-6 S form, despite the presence of molybdate. Most of the peak I receptor bound to a DNA-cellulose column and was eluted by high salt. The peak II receptor showed very little DNA binding."
