https://openalex.org/W2123510746,"There are few phenomena in condensed matter physics that are defined only by the fundamental constants and do not depend on material parameters. Examples are the resistivity quantum, h/e2 (h is Planck's constant and e the electron charge), that appears in a variety of transport experiments and the magnetic flux quantum, h/e, playing an important role in the physics of superconductivity. By and large, sophisticated facilities and special measurement conditions are required to observe any of these phenomena. We show that the opacity of suspended graphene is defined solely by the fine structure constant, a = e2/hc feminine 1/137 (where c is the speed of light), the parameter that describes coupling between light and relativistic electrons and that is traditionally associated with quantum electrodynamics rather than materials science. Despite being only one atom thick, graphene is found to absorb a significant (pa = 2.3%) fraction of incident white light, a consequence of graphene's unique electronic structure."

https://openalex.org/W2118082971,"Smoking is a leading cause of preventable death, causing about 5 million premature deaths worldwide each year. Evidence for genetic influence on smoking behaviour and nicotine dependence (ND) has prompted a search for susceptibility genes. Furthermore, assessing the impact of sequence variants on smoking-related diseases is important to public health. Smoking is the major risk factor for lung cancer (LC) and is one of the main risk factors for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Here we identify a common variant in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene cluster on chromosome 15q24 with an effect on smoking quantity, ND and the risk of two smoking-related diseases in populations of European descent. The variant has an effect on the number of cigarettes smoked per day in our sample of smokers. The same variant was associated with ND in a previous genome-wide association study that used low-quantity smokers as controls, and with a similar approach we observe a highly significant association with ND. A comparison of cases of LC and PAD with population controls each showed that the variant confers risk of LC and PAD. The findings provide a case study of a gene-environment interaction, highlighting the role of nicotine addiction in the pathology of other serious diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2119101994,"Limits on the storage capacity of working memory significantly affect cognitive abilities in a wide range of domains, but the nature of these capacity limits has been elusive. Some researchers have proposed that working memory stores a limited set of discrete, fixed-resolution representations, whereas others have proposed that working memory consists of a pool of resources that can be allocated flexibly to provide either a small number of high-resolution representations or a large number of low-resolution representations. Here we resolve this controversy by providing independent measures of capacity and resolution. We show that, when presented with more than a few simple objects, human observers store a high-resolution representation of a subset of the objects and retain no information about the others. Memory resolution varied over a narrow range that cannot be explained in terms of a general resource pool but can be well explained by a small set of discrete, fixed-resolution representations."
https://openalex.org/W1972020976,"To identify risk variants for lung cancer, we conducted a multistage genome-wide association study. In the discovery phase, we analyzed 315,450 tagging SNPs in 1,154 current and former (ever) smoking cases of European ancestry and 1,137 frequency-matched, ever-smoking controls from Houston, Texas. For replication, we evaluated the ten SNPs most significantly associated with lung cancer in an additional 711 cases and 632 controls from Texas and 2,013 cases and 3,062 controls from the UK. Two SNPs, rs1051730 and rs8034191, mapping to a region of strong linkage disequilibrium within 15q25.1 containing PSMA4 and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, were significantly associated with risk in both replication sets. Combined analysis yielded odds ratios of 1.32 (P < 1 x 10(-17)) for both SNPs. Haplotype analysis was consistent with there being a single risk variant in this region. We conclude that variation in a region of 15q25.1 containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors genes contributes to lung cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W2070143299,"Mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) occur at high frequency in human tumors, but whether these mutations alter tumor cell behavior has been unclear. We used cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) technology to replace the endogenous mtDNA in a mouse tumor cell line that was poorly metastatic with mtDNA from a cell line that was highly metastatic, and vice versa. Using assays of metastasis in mice, we found that the recipient tumor cells acquired the metastatic potential of the transferred mtDNA. The mtDNA conferring high metastatic potential contained G13997A and 13885insC mutations in the gene encoding NADH (reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) dehydrogenase subunit 6 ( ND6 ). These mutations produced a deficiency in respiratory complex I activity and were associated with overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment of the highly metastatic tumor cells with ROS scavengers suppressed their metastatic potential in mice. These results indicate that mtDNA mutations can contribute to tumor progression by enhancing the metastatic potential of tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W2120240963,"With the advent of large genomic data sets, geneticists can examine at a new level the influence of genes on behaviour. Two groups have conducted genome-wide association studies involving lung cancer, and both find that sequences in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene cluster contribute susceptibility, although the groups took different paths to this result. Hung et al. suggest that this susceptibility is not related to smoking status or frequency, and show association with a specific amino acid change. Thorgeirsson et al. find that alleles present in a cluster of nicotinic acid receptor genes do not influence whether or not a person smokes, but do affect the number of cigarettes smoked per day, and are therefore also associated with risk of lung cancer and peripheral arterial disease. Either way, the possible potential of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as drug targets is underlined. A genome-wide association study for lung cancer finds that genetic sequences in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit gene cluster contribute susceptibility. Interestingly, this susceptibility is not related to smoking status or frequency, and seems to come from a change in an amino acid in the receptor itself. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death worldwide, with over one million cases annually1. To identify genetic factors that modify disease risk, we conducted a genome-wide association study by analysing 317,139 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in 1,989 lung cancer cases and 2,625 controls from six central European countries. We identified a locus in chromosome region 15q25 that was strongly associated with lung cancer (P = 9 × 10-10). This locus was replicated in five separate lung cancer studies comprising an additional 2,513 lung cancer cases and 4,752 controls (P = 5 × 10-20 overall), and it was found to account for 14% (attributable risk) of lung cancer cases. Statistically similar risks were observed irrespective of smoking status or propensity to smoke tobacco. The association region contains several genes, including three that encode nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits (CHRNA5, CHRNA3 and CHRNB4). Such subunits are expressed in neurons and other tissues, in particular alveolar epithelial cells, pulmonary neuroendocrine cells and lung cancer cell lines2,3, and they bind to N′-nitrosonornicotine and potential lung carcinogens4. A non-synonymous variant of CHRNA5 that induces an amino acid substitution (D398N) at a highly conserved site in the second intracellular loop of the protein is among the markers with the strongest disease associations. Our results provide compelling evidence of a locus at 15q25 predisposing to lung cancer, and reinforce interest in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors as potential disease candidates and chemopreventative targets5."
https://openalex.org/W1992941940,"The EPICA ice core, drilled at Dome C in East Antarctica, provides an undisturbed record of the past eight climatic cycles. Dust particles in the atmosphere can affect temperature by absorbing or reflecting solar radiation, and previous work suggested that production, transport and deposition of dust is influenced by climatic changes on glacial-interglacial timescales. A new analysis of the record of dust deposits in the EPICA core shows that the flux in atmospheric dust content increasingly correlates with Antarctic temperature during glacial periods as the climate gets colder, indicative of a progressive coupling of the climates of Antarctica and lower latitudes. An observed 25-fold increase in glacial dust flux over all eight glacial periods may reflect a strengthening of South American dust sources, and longer dust-particle lifetimes in the upper troposphere due to a reduced hydrological cycle during ice ages. It has been suggested that production, transport, and deposition of dust is influenced by climatic changes on glacial-interglacial timescales. This paper presents a high-resolution record of aeolian dust from the EPICA Dome C ice core in East Antarctica, which suggests that dust is increasingly correlated with Antarctic temperature as the climate becomes colder, indicative of a progressive coupling of the climates of Antarctica and lower latitudes. Dust can affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere by absorbing or reflecting incoming solar radiation1; it can also be a source of micronutrients, such as iron, to the ocean2. It has been suggested that production, transport and deposition of dust is influenced by climatic changes on glacial-interglacial timescales3,4,5,6. Here we present a high-resolution record of aeolian dust from the EPICA Dome C ice core in East Antarctica, which provides an undisturbed climate sequence over the past eight climatic cycles7,8. We find that there is a significant correlation between dust flux and temperature records during glacial periods that is absent during interglacial periods. Our data suggest that dust flux is increasingly correlated with Antarctic temperature as the climate becomes colder. We interpret this as progressive coupling of the climates of Antarctic and lower latitudes. Limited changes in glacial-interglacial atmospheric transport time4,9,10 suggest that the sources and lifetime of dust are the main factors controlling the high glacial dust input. We propose that the observed ∼25-fold increase in glacial dust flux over all eight glacial periods can be attributed to a strengthening of South American dust sources, together with a longer lifetime for atmospheric dust particles in the upper troposphere resulting from a reduced hydrological cycle during the ice ages."

https://openalex.org/W1981364522,"Understanding inter-individual differences in stress response requires the explanation of genetic influences at multiple phenotypic levels, including complex behaviours and the metabolic responses of brain regions to emotional stimuli. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is anxiolytic and its release is induced by stress. NPY is abundantly expressed in regions of the limbic system that are implicated in arousal and in the assignment of emotional valences to stimuli and memories. Here we show that haplotype-driven NPY expression predicts brain responses to emotional and stress challenges and also inversely correlates with trait anxiety. NPY haplotypes predicted levels of NPY messenger RNA in post-mortem brain and lymphoblasts, and levels of plasma NPY. Lower haplotype-driven NPY expression predicted higher emotion-induced activation of the amygdala, as well as diminished resiliency as assessed by pain/stress-induced activations of endogenous opioid neurotransmission in various brain regions. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP rs16147) located in the promoter region alters NPY expression in vitro and seems to account for more than half of the variation in expression in vivo. These convergent findings are consistent with the function of NPY as an anxiolytic peptide and help to explain inter-individual variation in resiliency to stress, a risk factor for many diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2035921972,"Searches for extrasolar planets using the periodic Doppler shift of stellar spectral lines have recently achieved a precision of 60 cm s(-1) (ref. 1), which is sufficient to find a 5-Earth-mass planet in a Mercury-like orbit around a Sun-like star. To find a 1-Earth-mass planet in an Earth-like orbit, a precision of approximately 5 cm s(-1) is necessary. The combination of a laser frequency comb with a Fabry-Pérot filtering cavity has been suggested as a promising approach to achieve such Doppler shift resolution via improved spectrograph wavelength calibration, with recent encouraging results. Here we report the fabrication of such a filtered laser comb with up to 40-GHz (approximately 1-A) line spacing, generated from a 1-GHz repetition-rate source, without compromising long-term stability, reproducibility or spectral resolution. This wide-line-spacing comb, or 'astro-comb', is well matched to the resolving power of high-resolution astrophysical spectrographs. The astro-comb should allow a precision as high as 1 cm s(-1) in astronomical radial velocity measurements."

We establish that humans were present at Paisley 5 Mile Point Caves, in south-central Oregon, by 12,300 14C years B.P., through the recovery of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from coprolites, directly dated by accelerator mass spectrometry. The mtDNA corresponds to Native American founding haplogroups A2 and B2. The dates of the coprolites are >1000 14C years earlier than currently accepted dates for the Clovis complex."
https://openalex.org/W2057180718,"The introduction of disorder into thin superconducting films induces a droplet-like electronic texture, with superconducting islands immersed in a normal matrix. By fine-tuning this disorder, the system can be transformed from superconductor to insulator. A paper in this issue presents experimental evidence for the involvement of a previously uncharacterized 'superinsulating' state of matter in this process, a 'mirror image' equivalent of a superconductor with infinite resistance. During the transition from superconductor to insulator, a distinct conductivity state is formed, a Cooper-pair insulator, with thermally activated conductivity. Experiments in titanium nitride films show that at a certain finite temperature, a Cooper-pair insulator becomes a superinsulator, a state resembling superconductivity in that it is destroyed by a sufficiently strong critical magnetic field, and breaks down at some critical voltage. This paper shows that at a certain finite temperature, a Cooper-pair insulator undergoes a transition to a superinsulating state with infinite resistance. Experimental evidence of this transition in titanium nitride films is presented and it is demonstrated that the superinsulating state is dual to the superconducting state: it is destroyed by a sufficiently strong critical magnetic field, and breaks down at some critical voltage which is analogous to the critical current in superconductors. Synchronized oscillators are ubiquitous in nature1, and synchronization plays a key part in various classical and quantum phenomena. Several experiments2,3,4 have shown that in thin superconducting films, disorder enforces the droplet-like electronic texture—superconducting islands immersed into a normal matrix—and that tuning disorder drives the system from superconducting to insulating behaviour. In the vicinity of the transition, a distinct state4 forms: a Cooper-pair insulator, with thermally activated conductivity. It results from synchronization of the phase of the superconducting order parameter at the islands across the whole system5. Here we show that at a certain finite temperature, a Cooper-pair insulator undergoes a transition to a superinsulating state with infinite resistance. We present experimental evidence of this transition in titanium nitride films and show that the superinsulating state is dual to the superconducting state: it is destroyed by a sufficiently strong critical magnetic field, and breaks down at some critical voltage that is analogous to the critical current in superconductors."

https://openalex.org/W1964320153,"Efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic cells is crucial for tissue homeostasis and the immune response. Rab5 is known as a key regulator of the early endocytic pathway and we have recently shown that Rab5 is also implicated in apoptotic cell engulfment; however, the precise spatio-temporal dynamics of Rab5 activity remain unknown. Here, using a newly developed fluorescence resonance energy transfer biosensor, we describe a change in Rab5 activity during the engulfment of apoptotic thymocytes. Rab5 activity on phagosome membranes began to increase on disassembly of the actin coat encapsulating phagosomes. Rab5 activation was either continuous or repetitive for up to 10 min, but it ended before the collapse of engulfed apoptotic cells. Expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Rab5 delayed this collapse of apoptotic thymocytes, showing a role for Rab5 in phagosome maturation. Disruption of microtubules with nocodazole inhibited Rab5 activation on the phagosome membrane without perturbing the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Furthermore, we found that Gapex-5 is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor essential for Rab5 activation during the engulfment of apoptotic cells. Gapex-5 was bound to a microtubule-tip-associating protein, EB1, whose depletion inhibited Rab5 activation during phagocytosis. We therefore propose a mechanistic model in which the recruitment of Gapex-5 to phagosomes through the microtubule network induces the transient Rab5 activation."
https://openalex.org/W2126389915,"EphA2 is a member of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases. EphA2 mediates cell-cell communication and plays critical roles in a number of physiological and pathologic responses. We have previously shown that EphA2 is a key regulator of tumor angiogenesis and that tyrosine phosphorylation regulates EphA2 signaling. To understand the role of EphA2 phosphorylation, we have mapped phosphorylated tyrosines within the intracellular region of EphA2 by a combination of mass spectrometry analysis and phosphopeptide mapping using two-dimensional chromatography in conjunction with site-directed mutagenesis. The function of these phosphorylated tyrosine residues was assessed by mutational analysis using EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with EphA2 tyrosine-to-phenylalanine or tyrosine-to-glutamic acid substitution mutants. Phosphorylated Tyr(587) and Tyr(593) bind to Vav2 and Vav3 guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas Tyr(P)(734) binds to the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Mutations that uncouple EphA2 with Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factors or p85 are defective in Rac1 activation and cell migration. Finally, EphA2 mutations in the juxtamembrane region (Y587F, Y593F, Y587E/Y593E), kinase domain (Y734F), or SAM domain (Y929F) inhibited ephrin-A1-induced vascular assembly. In addition, EphA2-null endothelial cells reconstituted with these mutants were unable to incorporate into tumor vasculature, suggesting a critical role of these phosphorylation tyrosine residues in transducing EphA2 signaling in vascular endothelial cells during tumor angiogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1993191031,"We have previously reported that specific dopamine agonists mediate protection against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress by activating the D2 receptor-coupled phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI-3K)/Akt pathway. In the present study we examined the downstream effectors of PI-3K/Akt signaling and their role in cell death after oxidative stress and protection provided by ropinirole, a D2 receptor agonist in PC12 cells and primary cultures of dopamine neurons. Ropinirole treatment was associated with rapid translocation and phosphorylation of the PI-3K substrate Akt and phosphorylation of Akt substrates. One of these Akt downstream substrates was identified as the pro-apoptotic factor glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Ropinirole-induced protection was associated with phosphorylation of GSK-3β (inactivation). In contrast, inhibition of PI-3K blocked the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β (activation) and prevented the protection mediated by ropinirole. Suppression of Akt with specific short hairpin RNA in normal PC12 cells caused cell death, which was associated with reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3β and reduced levels of β-catenin, a transcriptional activator that is regulated by GSK-3β. Knock-out of GSK-3β expression with a short hairpin RNA alone was itself sufficient to cause cell death. We further demonstrated that oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) dephosphorylates Akt and GSK-3β, increases GSK-3β activity, and promotes an interaction with β-catenin and its degradation. Inhibition of GSK-3β activity by inhibitor VIII protects cells from H2O2 similar to ropinirole. These results indicate that GSK-3β downstream of Akt plays a critical role in cell death and survival in these models.

J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying dopaminergic cell death in PD has not been elucidated. A variety of cellular and molecular changes indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, proteasomal dysfunction, and apoptosis have been identified in the parkinsonian brain (for review, see Refs. 2Moore D.J. West A.B. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2005; 28: 57-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar and 3Olanow C.W. Annu. Rev. Med. 2004; 55: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Specifically, a large body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress or reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis may contribute to the progressive and selective neuronal degeneration observed in PD (4Beal M.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Brains of PD patients have increased iron, which promotes free radical formation, decreased levels of reduced glutathione, which is the major anti-oxidant in the brain, and evidence of oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins (5Teismann P. Vila M. Choi D.K. Tieu K. Wu D.C. Jackson-Lewis V. Przedborski S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 991: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the substantia nigra pars compacta of PD patients there are increased levels of cyclooxygenase, which contribute to formation of the oxidant species dopamine-quinone (5Teismann P.

Current therapies for PD are primarily based on a dopamine replacement strategy. Although they provide effective anti-parkinsonian effects, particularly in the early stages of the disease, PD patients eventually develop potentially disabling features such as falling, freezing, and dementia that are not satisfactorily controlled with available therapies (9Olanow C.W. Obeso J.A. Stocchi F. Lancet Neurol. 2006; 5: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). As a consequence, there has been an intensive search for therapies that might protect or restore function to neurons that would otherwise undergo degeneration in PD and thereby stop or slow the rate of disease progression. Dopamine agonists that activate D2 receptors are widely used to treat PD based on their capacity to provide short-term symptomatic improvements. Recent interest has also focused on the potential of dopamine agonists to provide neuroprotective effects and slow the rate of PD progression (18Olanow C.W. Jenner P. Brooks D. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Ropinirole and other dopamine agonists have been found to be capable of protecting dopamine neurons from a variety of toxins in both in vitro and in vivo models (10Du F. Li R. Huang Y. Li X. Le W.

Furthermore, in clinical trials in PD patients, ropinirole delayed the rate of decline of a neuroimaging surrogate biomarker of nigrostriatal function in comparison to levodopa (16Whone A.L.

Although several mechanisms have been proposed to account for how these agents might provide neuroprotection (18Olanow C.W. Jenner P. Brooks D. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), most interest has focused on the potential of their capacity to provide anti-apoptotic effects. However, the precise signaling mechanism whereby ropinirole induces anti-apoptotic effects is not known. Previously, we have demonstrated that some dopamine agonists protect PC12 cells from oxidative stress by activating a D2 receptor-dependent PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway independent of their ability to activate GTPγS binding (14Nair V.D.

To elucidate the downstream effectors of the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway that mediates the agonist-specific modulation of cell survival, we have investigated the anti-apoptotic signaling pathway activated by the dopamine agonist ropinirole. We now report that ropinirole-mediated protection against oxidative stress involves activation of PI-3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation (deactivation) of GSK-3β and that oxidative stress has opposing effects on the modulation of this pathway.

Dopaminergic neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 14 rat fetuses (E14; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) as previously described (22Bouvier M.M. Mytilineou C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 75: 7141-7149Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the ventral portion of the midbrain was removed in sterile ice-cold Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS/HEPES solution, cleaned free of meningeal tissue, and mechanically dissociated by passage through a flame-polished Pasteur pipette. Dissociated cells were plated at a density of ∼1.2 × 105 cells per cm2 on poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates or glass coverslips. The neurons were maintained in a chemically defined medium consisting of Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium/F-12 medium with N2 supplements, l-glutamine (0.5 mm), and penicillin/streptomycin (serum-free medium). Half of the culture medium was replaced every 2 days. Approximately 5-7-day-old cultures were used for experiments. CellTiter-Blue Cytotoxicity Assays—For analysis of cell survival, cells were plated at a density of 104 cells/well on 96-microwell cell culture plates (in 100 μl of medium) and grown for 24 h. Thereafter, 200 μm H2O2 was added either with or without ropinirole at the indicated concentrations, and cells were incubated for another 24 h. After treatments, 20 μl of the Cell-Titer-Blue reagent was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 2-3 h. The conversion of non-fluorescent Cell-Titer-Blue reagent to highly fluorescent substrate by living cells was quantified using a spectrofluorometer (Spectra Max Gemini XS, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described (19Nair V.D.

Transfections and DNA Constructs—PC12-D2R cells (1 × 105) were plated into 60-mm culture dishes with complete medium. After 24 h, the cells were transfected with 2.5 μg of the plasmid DNA encoding the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of Akt protein kinase (1-167 amino acids) tagged with green fluorescent protein (PH-Akt-GFP) (15Nair V.D.

Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 955-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—For immunofluorescence detection, PC12-D2R cells expressing PH-Akt-GFP cells were treated with ropinirole for 15 min. The cells were fixed, and GFP was visualized under an Olympus (BX65) upright epifluorescence microscope. To detect endogenous phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3β, GSK-3β, and β-catenin, PC12-D2R cells were immunostained with antibodies to phospho-Akt, phospho-GSK-3β, GSK-3β, or β-catenin and visualized using Alexa Fluor 592-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG as described previously (20Nair V.D.

To detect phospho-GSK-3β in dopamine neurons, primary mesencephalic cultures were stained with antibodies specific to tyrosine hydroxylase and phospho-GSK-3β and visualized using Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-sheep IgG and 592-conjugated chicken anti-rabbit IgG. The nuclei were stained with fluorescent DNA dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). The slides were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) mounting medium and examined under an Olympus (BX65) upright epifluorescence microscope. Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Cells (3 × 106 cells/100-mm plate) were grown for 24 h, and after respective treatments, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% IGEPAL C630, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, equal amounts of proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with phosphorylated Akt, Akt substrates, GSK-3β, p70S6 kinase, FKHR, or β-catenin and then detected with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL reagent. The blots were then stripped in stripping buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and probed for total Akt, GSK-3β, or β-actin proteins. For immunoprecipitation, the protein extract was incubated sequentially (2 h for each incubation at 4 °C) with anti-GSK-3β antibody and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with gentle agitation. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min in 3× Laemmli sample buffer, and processed for Western blotting using GSK-3β or β-catenin antibody. The blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibodies. In Vitro GSK-3β Activity Assay—GSK-3β was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C from 1 mg of protein extract with 2 μg of anti-GSK-3β antibody and anti-rabbit IgG beads (eBioscience, San Diego, CA). Bacterial lysate for GST-β-catenin fusion protein (24Wei Y. Renard C.A. Labalette C. Wu Y. Levy L. Neuveut C. Prieur X. Flajolet M. Prigent S. Buendia M.A. J. Biol.

Beads were then incubated with GSK-3β immunoprecipitate in assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ATP) for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of Laemmli loading buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Western immunoblotting was carried out using Rabbit IgG TrueBlot Set reagents (eBioscience). Anti-β-catenin and anti-phospho-β-catenin antibodies were used to detect GST-β-catenin. To detect GSK-3β in the reaction mixture, anti-GSK-3β antibody was used. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by either two-tailed t test or analysis of variance followed by the Tukeyŉs test to correct for multiple comparisons. The Dopamine Agonist Ropinirole Protects PC12-D2R Cells and Primary Mesencephalic Neurons from Cell Death Induced by Oxidative Stress via Activation of the D2 Receptors—We studied the potential of the dopamine agonist ropinirole to protect against apoptosis induced by H2O2 in PC12 cells that express D2 receptors (PC12-D2R). Cells were preincubated (1 h) with varying concentrations of ropinirole (10-11 to 10-3 m) before the addition of H2O2 (200 μm). After 24 h of incubation, cell viability was assessed using the CellTiter-Blue cell death assay. The administration of 200 μm of H2O2 induced a 52.9 ± 5.0% reduction in cell survival in comparison to controls. Ropinirole protected PC12-D2R cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis in a robust and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). In contrast, ropinirole did not protect PC12 cells that lacked D2 receptors from exposure to H2O2. Ropinirole also did not protect against H2O2 when PC12-D2R cells were pretreated with the dopamine antagonist haloperidol (10 μm) before the addition of ropinirole (Fig. 1B). Although PC12 cells are used as a good model to study dopaminergic function, they are non-neuronal cells derived from adrenal pheochromocytomas. Therefore, to further determine whether ropinirole protects dopamine neurons, we used primary rat mesencephalic neuronal cultures treated with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, ropinirole (1 μm) offered significant neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-induced neuronal loss. Our results are consistent with the report that ropinirole protects the primary mesencephalic neurons from 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, the active metabolite of the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine toxicity (10Du F. Li R. Huang Y. Li X. Le W. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 2422-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Ropinirole did not protect against 6-OHDA toxicity when primary mesencephalic neurons were co-incubated with ropinirole plus the dopamine antagonist eticlopride (10 μm) (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that ropinirole protects dopamine neurons against cell death induced by H2O2 and 6-OHDA and that this protection occurs by way of functional D2 receptors. Ropinirole Induced Protection in PC12-D2R Cells, and Primary Mesencephalic Neurons Involves the PI-3K/Akt Signaling Pathway—We have previously reported that the increase in cell survival mediated by D2 receptor activation is abolished by inhibitors of PI-3K (14Nair V.D. Olanow W. Sealfon S.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We, therefore, studied whether PI-3K signaling is modulated by the D2 receptor when complexed with ropinirole. To determine whether PI-3K signaling is involved in ropinirole-mediated protection, we tested the effect of the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm). Inhibition of PI-3K completely abolished the capacity of ropinirole to protect against cell death induced by oxidative stress in PC12 cells and by 6-OHDA in primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures (Fig. 1, B-D). However, LY294002 by itself had no effect on cell survival (Fig. 1B). These data suggest that activation of the PI-3K pathway contributes to the protective effects of ropinirole against apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in PC12-D2R cells and by 6-OHDA in primary mesencephalic neuronal cultures. To examine if Akt, the principle downstream target of PI-3K (25Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar), is implicated in ropinirole-mediated neuroprotection, we measured the translocation and phosphorylation of Akt after ropinirole administration. Akt phosphorylation and its protective effects occur after it translocates to the plasma membrane through an interaction of its N-terminal PH domain with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (26Datta K. Franke T.F. Chan T.O. Makris A. Yang S.I. Kaplan D.R. Morrison D.K. Golemis E.A. Tsichlis P.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2304-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), thereby bringing the enzyme into the proximity of additional PIP3-dependent and -independent protein kinases (27Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The distribution of Akt was assessed using a PH-Akt-GFP (15Nair V.D. Sealfon S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47053-47061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, phosphorylated Akt was mainly localized in the perikarya (supplemental Fig. 1). In contrast, D2 receptor activation by ropinirole caused a rapid (15 min) translocation of PH-Akt-GFP to peripheral membrane regions (Fig. 2A, right panel). Ropinirole-induced translocation was similarly demonstrated using antibodies to endogenous phospho-Akt (Fig. 2, B and C). The addition of ropinirole to normal PC12-D2R cells was also associated with a significant increase in phosphorylated Akt, with phosphorylation occurring at the serine 473 (Ser473) site. These results were also observed 15 min after the addition of the drug and returned to basal levels at 60 min (Fig. 2, D and E). Levels of total Akt protein remained unchanged. Thus, D2 receptor stimulation by ropinirole in PC12-D2R cells causes rapid translocation and phosphorylation of Akt. These changes in Akt translocation and phosphorylation were prevented by co-administration of the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown), indicating that ropinirole induces Akt activation through a PI-3K signaling pathway. Effects of Ropinirole on Downstream Effectors of PI-3K/Akt Signaling Pathway—The PI-3K/Akt pathway is known to promote cell survival by inactivating pro-apoptotic factors and activating anti-apoptotic factors by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms (28Datta S.R.

Hemmings B.A. Cell. 2002; 111: 293-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To determine whether ropinirole induces the activation of any specific effectors of the PI-3K/Akt pathway, we examined the effect of ropinirole on the phosphorylation at Ser/Thr of Akt substrate proteins (28Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1997; 91: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4957) Google Scholar) when administered to untreated PC12-D2R cells. Western blot analysis demonstrated that ropinirole treatment induced a transient accumulation of phosphorylated Akt substrates coincident with the timing of the phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 3A). One of the phosphorylated downstream substrates of Akt was established to be GSK-3β (Fig. 3, B and C), which in its activated (dephosphorylated) state promotes cell death in response to oxidative stress (31Castelo-Branco G. Rawal N. Arenas E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 5731-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ropinirole did not induce phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase or FKHR (Fig. 3B), two other downstream substrates of Akt. Blockade of PI-3K by LY294002 blocked the ropinirole-induced phosphorylation of Akt substrates including GSK-3β (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Inhibition of PI 3-kinase abolished the phosphorylation of Akt and effectors of Akt by ropinirole. PC12-D2R cells were pretreated with PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm) for 30 min and incubated with 1 μm of ropinirole for 15 min. After stimulation, cells lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western immunoblotting with specific antibodies anti-phospho (p)-Akt, phospho-(Ser/Thr) Akt substrates, and phospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) antibodies. Phospho-GSK-3β blot was stripped and reprobed with anti-β-actin antibody. Experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Note that ropinirole induces phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β and that these effects are reversed with the PI-3K inhibitor LY294001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Akt and GSK-3β Are Essential for Cell Survival—To investigate the role of Akt/GSK-3β signaling in cell survival, shRNA specific to Akt1 and GSK-3β were used (23Yu J.Y. Taylor J. DeRuiter S.L. Vojtek A.B. Turner D.L. Mol. Ther. 2003; 7: 228-236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We used a PH-Akt-GFP construct to determine the transfection efficiency of PC12-D2R cells. Transient expression of PH-Akt-GFP yielded ∼50-60% GFP-positive cells after 48 h of transfection (data not shown). When normal PC12-D2R cells were transfected with either Akt shRNA or GSK-3β shRNA, markedly reduced cell viability was observed 48 h after transfection (Fig. 5, A and B). When compared with transfection of the U6-XASH3 HP control vector, transfection of hairpin small interfering RNA expression vectors against Akt and GSK-3β reduced the expression of Akt and GSK-3β, respectively (Fig. 5, A and B). Because GSK-3β is a downstream effector of Akt, we examined the phosphorylation of GSK-3β in Akt knockdown cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, Akt suppression reduced phosphorylation of GSK-3β and the levels of the GSK-3β target β-catenin (32Woodgett J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). To further confirm the role of Akt in cell survival, we have assessed the levels of Akt in cells transfected with Akt1 shRNA. We find that Akt levels are preserved in cells showing normal nuclear morphology and markedly reduced in cells showing condensed nuclei, indicating a strong correlation between cell death and low levels of Akt (Fig. 5D). These results suggest that Akt acting through GSK-3β signaling is necessary for the survival of PC12-D2R cells. Previously we have demonstrated that p53 and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling plays an important role in mediating cell death and survival, respectively, in these cells (19Nair V.D.

https://openalex.org/W2038541420,"Vascular tissue engineering has emerged as a promising technology for the design of an ideal, responsive, living conduit with properties similar to that of native tissue. The missing link in tissue-engineered blood vessels is elastin biosynthesis. Several biomaterials are currently used but few support elastin biosynthesis in a 3-D array. In previous studies, we demonstrated that a hyaluronan-based scaffold (HYAFF-11) grafted in the infrarenal rat aorta successfully guided the complete regeneration of a well-functioning small-diameter (2 mm) neoartery. The aim of the present study was to test the ability of HYAFF-11 biodegradable grafts to develop into neovessels of larger size (4 mm) in a porcine model, focusing on extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and elastin biosynthesis. HYAFF-11 tubes (diameter 4 mm, length 5 cm) were implanted in an end-to-end fashion in the common carotid artery. Grafts were analyzed for patency with a Duplex scan every 15 days. ECM components were evaluated by histological and molecular biological methods. All the animals survived the observation period without complications. Intimal hyperplasia (initiating at the anastomotic site) and graft thrombosis led to 3 cases of partial or complete occlusion, as demonstrated by histological examination. There were no signs of stenoses or aneurysms in the remaining grafts. After 5 months, the biomaterial was almost completely degraded and replaced by a neoartery segment composed of mature smooth muscle cells, collagen, and elastin fibers organized in layers and was completely covered on the luminal surface by endothelial cells (vWF(+)). Whereas in previous small animal studies, patency rates were not optimal, those obtained in the present study using hyaluronan-based grafts of larger size confirmed the ability of these constructs to guide the development of a well-functioning neoartery, with the remarkable additional attribute of facilitating the formation of organized layers of elastin fibers."
https://openalex.org/W2135830937,"Bactericidal properties were recently shown to emerge from hydrophobicity and charge buildup in oligo-acyl-lysine (OAK) peptide mimetics. Toward understanding the attributes that govern the activity of this novel antimicrobial system, we compared the functional and mechanistic properties of a known octamer and a newly generated hexamer analog. The data provide strong evidence for multiple similarities that included high tissue stability, low hemolysis, large-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro, and the ability to prevent Escherichia coli-induced mortality in vivo. Despite these similarities, however, the octamer mode of action involved membrane disruption, unlike the hexamer, which acted predominantly through inhibition of DNA functions with characteristically slower bactericidal kinetics. Collectively, the data support the view that the analogous OAKs induced bacterial death by distinct mechanisms and further suggest that relatively minor differences in the sequence of host defense peptides are responsible for selecting one mechanism over another, possibly in conjunction with differential binding affinities to the external and/or cytoplasmic membrane."

Res. 1984; 276: 390-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). There are also indirect pieces of evidence for the existence of an RBP receptor. For example, in an unbiased search for a serum factor that stimulates the growth of B cells, it was found that the vitamin A-RBP complex (holo-RBP) is this factor (21Buck J. Ritter G. Dannecker L. Katta V. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. Hammerling U. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 171: 1613-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Using an unbiased strategy combining photo-cross-linking, high-affinity purification, and mass spectrometry, the RBP receptor was identified as STRA6, a multi-transmembrane protein of previously unknown function (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). STRA6 binds to RBP with high affinity and specificity and facilitates the transport of vitamin A into the cell. STRA6 was originally identified as a retinoic acid-stimulated gene in cancer cell lines (23Bouillet P. Sapin V. Chazaud C. Messaddeq N. Decimo D. Dolle P. Chambon P. Mech. Dev. 1997; 63: 173-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 24Szeto W. Jiang W. Tice D.A. Rubinfeld B. Hollingshead P.G. Fong S.E. Dugger D.L. Pham T. Yansura D.G. Wong T.A. Grimaldi J.C.

STRA6 has not been systematically characterized at the structural and functional level and is not homologous to any protein with known function. In this study, we used two complementary approaches to study the structure and function of STRA6. The first approach was to create a large number of random mutants of STRA6 and systematically analyze their properties. An analogous large-scale mutagenesis strategy has been used successfully to study potassium channels (25Bichet D. Lin Y.F. Ibarra C.A. Huang C.S. Yi B.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4441-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 26Yi B.A. Lin Y.F. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Cell. 1999; 96: 879-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The second approach was to analyze naturally occurring human STRA6 mutants and polymorphisms. The advantage of the first approach is that it is unbiased and is especially suitable for analyzing proteins that have no obvious functional domains and that are not homologous to any protein of known function like STRA6. The advantage of the second approach is that it can provide the biochemical basis for the human genetics of STRA6. Recent human genetic studies found that mutations in STRA6 are associated with severe pathological phenotypes such as mental retardation, anophthalmia, congenital heart defects, lung hyperplasia, duodenal stenosis, pancreatic malformations, and intrauterine growth retardation (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G. Brasch F. Schirmer-Zimmermann H. Tolmie J.L. Chitayat D. Houge G. Fernandez-Martinez L. Keating S. Mortier G.

Genet. 2007; 80: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified the functional defects in these naturally occurring human STRA6 mutants and polymorphisms. Production of Random Mutants and Site-directed Mutagenesis of STRA6—Random mutagenesis of bovine STRA6 cDNA was performed using the GeneMorph II random mutagenesis system (Stratagene) between the HindIII and XbaI sites (from residues 232 to 362). The mutagenesis protocol was optimized so that each mutant contains one to four mutations; this is an acceptable rate because not all mutations cause an amino acid change. To facilitate the examination of the cell surface expression of each mutant, mutagenesis was performed on STRA6 tagged with a high-affinity binding site for α-bungarotoxin as described below. Site-directed mutagenesis of human STRA6 or bovine STRA6 was performed by PCR. Examination of Cell Surface Expression of STRA6 Mutants Using α-Bungarotoxin—α-Bungarotoxin and its high-affinity binding site (BBS) provide an efficient tagging system to study cell surface proteins (30Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17114-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). An amino acid sequence containing BBS was inserted into an extracellular loop of bovine STRA6 between residues 133 and 134 (STRA6-BBS) (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Because STRA6-BBS behaves similarly to wild-type STRA6 (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar) and BBS is located extracellularly, live cells transfected with the STRA6-BBS construct can be stained with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) to examine STRA6 cell surface expression. Briefly, STRA6 mutants with a BBS tag were transfected into HEK293 cells growing on gelatin-coated coverslips. Twenty-four h after transfection, Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated α-bungarotoxin was added to the medium at 5 μg/ml. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS) three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three more washes with HBSS, the coverslips containing cells were mounted onto slides using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). The cell surface expression of each mutant was individually examined by fluorescence microscopy. Assay for Vitamin A Uptake Activity Using [3H]-Retinol/RBP—The production of [3H]-retinol/RBP was performed similarly as described (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). All STRA6 variants were cotransfected with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase for the vitamin A uptake assay. To determine cellular [3H]-retinol uptake from [3H]-retinol/RBP, cells were washed with HBSS before incubation with [3H]-retinol/RBP diluted in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. The reactions were stopped by removing the medium, washing the cells with HBSS, and solubilizing the cells in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Radioactivity was measured with a scintillation counter. Quantitation of RBP Binding Activity—Quantitation of RBP binding to STRA6 using alkaline phosphatase-RBP fusion protein was performed similarly as described (31Hsieh J.C. Rattner A. Smallwood P.M. Nathans J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3546-3551Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells grown on 12-well cell culture plates were washed once with HBSS and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-RBP fusion protein diluted in serum-free medium at 37 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by washing cells twice with HBSS. The cells were then lysed in 150 μl of cold PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors per well. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatants were removed and heated at 65 °C for 1 h to inactivate endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Fifty μl of the heated lysate were mixed with 200 μl of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h for the alkaline phosphatase color reaction. The reactions were stopped by adding 50 μl of 3 m NaOH, and then the lysate was transferred to a 96-well plate for reading in a microplate reader at 405 nm. Quantitation of Cell Surface Expression of STRA6 Mutants—We introduced a Myc tag at the position where BBS is inserted in STRA6-BBS (STRA6-Myc) to quantify its cell surface expression using anti-Myc antibody. Briefly, 24 h after transfection of COS-1 cells with STRA6 variants with the Myc tag, anti-Myc antibody was added to the medium for 1 h. After three washes with HBSS, the cells were incubated in 5% normal rabbit serum in serum-free medium for 15 min. Rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Pierce) diluted in 5% normal rabbit serum in serum-free medium was then added to the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After four washes with HBSS, cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in PBS with protease inhibitors. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatant was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as described above. Live Cell Staining and Permeabilized Cell Staining—Briefly, STRA6-Myc constructs were transfected into HEK293 cells growing on gelatin-coated coverslips. At 24 h after transfection, purified anti-Myc monoclonal antibody was added to the medium. After a 1-h incubation at 37 °C, the cells were washed with HBSS three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with blocking buffer (5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking buffer for another hour at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the coverslips containing cells were mounted onto slides using VectorShield mounting medium. The cell surface expression of STRA6-Myc proteins was examined by fluorescence microscopy. Permeabilized staining was performed similarly to live cell staining procedures except that cells were incubated with the primary antibody after they were fixed. An Unbiased Strategy to Study the Structure and Function of STRA6—Because STRA6 has not been systematically characterized at the structural level and little is known about its structure, we designed an unbiased strategy to study its structure and function (Fig. 1). Our previous small-scale analysis identified a bovine STRA6 mutant (Q310H/L315P) with normal surface expression but impaired RBP binding (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). By analyzing the individual mutations (Q310H and L315P), we found that L315P is responsible for the loss of RBP binding activity (data not shown). However, residue 315 is located in a region of STRA6 predicted to be a transmembrane domain (completely devoid of hydrophilic residues). Given the large impact of proline on protein structure beyond the mutated residue, residue 315 may not be directly involved in RBP binding. Instead, this mutant implicated a larger region of STRA6 around residue 315 in RBP interaction. Therefore, we performed an unbiased large-scale mutational analysis of the region around this residue (residues 232–362). This strategy is more practical than mutating the whole gene because of its large size and the lack of prior knowledge available about its structure. Using random mutagenesis, we produced 902 random mutants of STRA6. The mutagenized protein is a tagged version of STRA6, which made it possible to efficiently examine STRA6 cell surface expression, as described below. We optimized the mutagenesis protocol so that each mutant contained one to four mutations. This was verified by sequencing. We found that no identical mutation occurred in more than one clone. These mutants were then individually transfected into COS-1 cells together with lecithin:retinol acyltransferase for vitamin A uptake assay from [3H]-retinol/RBP. As shown in Fig. 2, a large number of mutants had significantly reduced vitamin A uptake activity. Among them, 141 mutants had <50% of the wild-type STRA6 activity in vitamin A uptake from holo-RBP, and 102 mutants had <10% of the wild-type activity. Sequence analysis revealed mutations scattered throughout the mutagenized region of STRA6. Most of the severely defective mutants are nonsense or frameshift mutations that introduce premature stop codons. Cell Surface Expression and RBP Binding Activity of STRA6 Mutants—α-Bungarotoxin and BBS provide an efficient tagging system to study membrane proteins (30Sekine-Aizawa Y. Huganir R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17114-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Dellis O. Dedos S.G. Tovey S.C. Taufiq Ur R. Dubel S.J. Taylor C.W. Science. 2006; 313: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We found previously that insertion of BBS into an extracellular loop of STRA6 does not interfere with either cell surface expression or vitamin A uptake activity (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). This STRA6-BBS construct is an ideal template for mutagenesis because mutants can be efficiently screened for cell surface expression. We examined all defective mutants for their cell surface expression. We found that most defective mutants were absent or expressed poorly on the cell surface, which is sufficient to account for their loss of retinol uptake activity. These results demonstrate the dependence of vitamin A uptake activity on the cell surface expression of STRA6. Examples of two STRA6 mutants with complete (mutant 69, T306P) or partial (mutant 678, V284I/Y309H) loss of surface expression are shown in Fig. 3. Strikingly, only two of the 141 defective STRA6 mutants had a level of cell surface expression similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 3). These two mutants (mutant 444, T304S/Y336C, and mutant 595, H266L/Y336N) had largely abolished vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP (Figs. 2 and 3). We further tested RBP binding for these two mutants and found that their loss of RBP binding was largely responsible for their loss of vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP (Fig. 3). Identification and Characterization of an RBP-binding Domain in STRA6—Both of the severe STRA6 mutants with normal cell surface expression have an alteration of Tyr336. Several other mutants with defective vitamin A uptake activity (with partial or complete loss of surface expression) also point to the region around Tyr336 as potentially important in STRA6 function (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to perform systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the region of STRA6 around Tyr336 by changing glycine and alanine to leucine and all other residues to alanine. We performed this site-directed mutagenesis using a Myc-tagged STRA6 (the Myc is located in the same extracellular loop where the BBS is located), which makes it possible to examine cell surface expression by immunostaining and quantify cell surface expression. Of the 22 mutants in this series, four showed significantly reduced vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP (D333A, Y336A, G340L, and G342L) (Fig. 4). These four residues are highly conserved in evolution (Fig. 4). Further characterization of the cell surface expression of these mutant proteins showed that one mutant, D333A, lost its cell surface expression, but the other three had normal cell surface expression, as assessed by both live cell staining and Myc quantitation (Fig. 5). The normal cell surface expression but loss of vitamin A uptake activity of the Y336A mutant is consistent with the phenotypes of the two mutants that affect this residue identified through random mutagenesis (Fig. 3). All three mutants with normal surface expression lost RBP binding activity (Fig. 5), demonstrating that their loss of vitamin A uptake activities is due to defective RBP binding.FIGURE 5Characterization of four defective STRA6 mutants identified through alanine-scanning mutagenesis.A, cell surface expression of STRA6 mutants D333A, Y336A, G340L, and G342L.

This finding was further confirmed by another human genetic study identifying mutations in STRA6 responsible for Matthew-Wood syndrome (29Golzio C. Martinovic-Bouriel J. Thomas S. Mougou-Zrelli S.

Mutations identified in these studies include five point mutations, a frameshift mutation leading to a premature stop codon (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R.

The five point mutations (P90L/T321P, P293L, R644M, and R655C) occur in conserved residues (from fish to human) (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G. Brasch F. Schirmer-Zimmermann H. Tolmie J.L. Chitayat D. Houge G. Fernandez-Martinez L. Keating S. Mortier G. Hennekam R.C. von der Wense A. Slavotinek A. Meinecke P. Bitoun P. Becker C. Nurnberg P. Reis A. Rauch A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80: 550-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Because the biochemical defects caused by point mutations are not known, we decided to study the detailed mechanistic defects in STRA6 caused by these five point mutations. For the two mutations found in one patient (P90L/T321P), the mutations were analyzed singly and combined. There are also four non-synonymous human STRA6 polymorphisms in the GenBank™ Data Bank: D26N, G339S, L517F, and I527M. We analyzed the effect of these polymorphisms on STRA6 functions. For all human variants, we produced them in an untagged and Myc-tagged human STRA6 background, which allows examination of cell surface expression. We systematically analyzed their vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP, their cell surface expression, and their RBP binding activity. All human STRA6 mutations associated with birth defects except T321P almost completely abolished vitamin A uptake activity of STRA6 from holo-RBP (Fig. 6). This suggests that for the patient carrying the P90L/T321P double mutations, P90L is the causal mutation. All mutations except T321P led to the loss of cell surface expression of STRA6 (Fig. 7). Unlike the mutant that loses expression because of a frameshift mutation (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G. Brasch F. Schirmer-Zimmermann H. Tolmie J.L. Chitayat D. Houge G. Fernandez-Martinez L. Keating S. Mortier G. Hennekam R.C. von der Wense A. Slavotinek A. Meinecke P. Bitoun P. Becker C. Nurnberg P. Reis A. Rauch A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80: 550-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), permeabilized immunostaining and Western blot analysis showed that all five point mutants were still expressed (Fig. 7). Therefore, these mutations either cause misfolding of STRA6 or interfere with its targeting mechanism to prevent cell surface expression, which can account for their loss of vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we performed a cell-free vitamin A uptake assay using membrane prepared from transfected cells as we have performed previously for wild-type STRA6 (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Again, the mutants also lacked vitamin A uptake activity in the cell-free system (data not shown). This experiment suggests that the mutations affect the proper folding of STRA6 instead of its cell surface targeting. They are mechanistically similar to most defective STRA6 mutants generated by random mutagenesis in that they fail to be expressed on the cell surface.FIGURE 7Analysis of protein expression of human STRA6 variants (P90L, T321P, P90L/T321P, P293L, T644M, R655C, and G339S).A, live cell staining of human STRA6 variants to examine cell surface expression (upper panels) and fixed and permeabilized cell staining of human STRA6 variants (lower panels).

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the four human STRA6 polymorphisms, three (D26N, L517F, and I527M) did not have a significant effect on vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP, but the G339S polymorphism led to significantly reduced vitamin A uptake activity. We found by both live cell staining (Fig. 7) and cell surface expression quantitation (Fig. 8) that this polymorphism did not affect the cell surface expression of STRA6. It caused decreased vitamin A uptake activity by reducing STRA6 RBP binding activity (Fig. 8). Key STRA6 Mutations and Polymorphisms in the Transmembrane Topology Model of STRA6—In an independent study, we experimentally determined the transmembrane topology of STRA6 (33Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Wiita P. Ter-Stepanian M. Sun H. Biochemistry. 2008; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The locations of the key STRA6 mutations and polymorphisms in this topology model are summarized in Fig. 9. Mutations identified by random mutagenesis that cause severe loss of STRA6 function are located throughout the region of STRA6 subjected to the mutagenesis. The region where the three essential residues involved in RBP binding (Tyr336, Gly340, and Gly342 in bovine STRA6) are located was predicted to be a transmembrane domain in bovine STRA6 (but not in mouse STRA6) by two computer programs (SOSUI and TMPRED). This contrasts with the fact that it contains several hydrophilic residues, including arginine, aspartate, and glutamate. The identification of key residues involved in RBP interaction in this region demonstrates the advantage of using an unbiased experimental approach to study STRA6 instead of relying on targeted mutagenesis based on predicted models. The human polymorphism that causes reduced RBP binding affects residue 339. Interestingly, human STRA6 Gly339 is equivalent to bovine STRA6 Gly340, which we identified as a critical residue in the interaction of STRA6 with RBP through random mutagenesis and alanine scanning (Fig. 9). The power of mutagenesis to study protein function has been illustrated by the excellent mechanistic studies of rhodopsin. A large number of natural and artificial rhodopsin mutants have revealed deep mechanistic insights into rhodopsin activation, phosphorylation, inactivation by arrestin, interaction with transducin, interaction with its chromophore, and rhodopsin trafficking. This study represents the first systematic analysis of the structure and function of STRA6, the high-affinity membrane receptor for RBP. Although STRA6 is not homologous to any protein of known function (and therefore has no obvious functional domains), its multi-transmembrane domains and its function as the RBP receptor in mediating vitamin A uptake imply that it has extracellular domains that participate in RBP interaction. Because ligand binding may involve multiple interacting sites, the large size of STRA6 and its absence of obvious functional domains make it impractical to perform site-directed mutagenesis as the initial approach to identify the RBP-binding domain(s). Indeed, most defective mutants generated through random mutagenesis consisted of mutants that failed to be expressed on the cell surface. Because the loss of cell surface expression (by either misfolding or loss of proper targeting) is sufficient to account for the loss of vitamin A uptake activity, these mutants do not reveal the functional domains in STRA6. Interestingly, most of the severe missense mutations involve proline residues (either change to or from proline) (Fig. 9), consistent with the unique role of proline in protein structure. These mutations likely cause large structural changes and misfolding of STRA6, which can prevent cell surface expression. Several natural human mutations also involve proline, similar to most of the severe mutations identified in our large-scale mutagenesis (Fig. 9). By focusing on mutants with normal cell surface expression, our large-scale mutagenesis study identified an essential RBP-binding domain in STRA6. Because mutation in any one of three key residues in this domain is sufficient to decimate the RBP binding and vitamin A uptake activities of STRA6, these three residues are likely located in the contact site for the STRA6-RBP interaction. This finding also further demonstrated the specific interaction between RBP and STRA6. Coincidentally, one of the key residues for RBP binding identified by alanine scanning in bovine STRA6 is also the residue affected by a polymorphism in human STRA6 that leads to partial loss of RBP binding. This study does not imply that these key residues are the only residues in this region involved in STRA6 interaction with RBP. It is possible that there are other key residues in this region, but their mutations cause misfolding of the protein, or that there are other residues involved in RBP binding, but mutating a single residue does not cause as profound an effect on RBP binding as Tyr336, Gly340, and Gly342. The function of the RBP receptor in human development has been demonstrated by two human genetic studies. Mutations in human STRA6 cause either embryonic lethality or severe birth defects in many organ systems (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G.

In this study, we showed that the point mutations in human STRA6 associated with birth defects cause severe or complete loss of vitamin A uptake activity from holo-RBP due to their absence of cell surface expression. These biochemical defects are consistent with the severe clinical phenotypes associated with these mutations (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G.

These mutations are mechanistically similar to the common mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (Δ508) that causes cystic fibrosis in that they have defective cell surface expression (34Denning G.M. Anderson M.P. Amara J.F. Marshall J. Smith A.E. Welsh M.J. Nature. 1992; 358: 761-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Only two natural RBP mutations have been identified in humans, and they cause vision defects such as the dystrophy of retinal pigment epithelium, an essential cell type in vision (35Seeliger M.W. Biesalski H.K. Wissinger B. Gollnick H. Gielen S. Frank J. Beck S. Zrenner E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is consistent with the high expression levels of STRA6 in retinal pigment epithelium cells, which need to absorb large amount of vitamin A for proper visual functions. How can we reconcile the relatively restricted phenotypes caused by the two RBP mutations in humans (35Seeliger M.W. Biesalski H.K. Wissinger B. Gollnick H. Gielen S. Frank J. Beck S. Zrenner E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar) and the more severe and systemic phenotypes caused by STRA6 mutations in humans (28Pasutto F. Sticht H. Hammersen G. Gillessen-Kaesbach G. Fitzpatrick D.R. Nurnberg G. Brasch F. Schirmer-Zimmermann H. Tolmie J.L. Chitayat D. Houge G. Fernandez-Martinez L. Keating S. Mortier G. Hennekam R.C. von der Wense A.

Genet. 2007; 80: 1179-1187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar)? First, biochemical analysis showed that the only two natural mutations found in human RBP cause only a partial loss of RBP function (36Folli C. Viglione S. Busconi M. Berni R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast to the complete or nearly complete loss of STRA6 function described in this work. The human RBP mutants can still bind retinol (36Folli C. Viglione S. Busconi M. Berni R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 336: 1017-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Second, holo-RBP formed by the mutant RBP can still bind transthyretin like wild-type RBP. The major defect identified is the relatively faster release of retinol in the presence of lipid membranes. The vision defect associated with human RBP mutations suggests that vision is most sensitive to the partial loss of RBP function. RBP is highly conserved in evolution. The fact that human RBP mutations are so rarely identified (only two so far) is consistent with its essential function. Moreover, the detection limit of serum retinol/RBP in patients with RBP mutations in the previous study was 200 nm (35Seeliger M.W. Biesalski H.K. Wissinger B. Gollnick H. Gielen S. Frank J. Beck S. Zrenner E. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 3-11PubMed Google Scholar), which is still much higher than the Kd (50 nm) of the STRA6-RBP interaction (22Kawaguchi R. Yu J. Honda J. Hu J. Whitelegge J. Ping P. Wiita P. Bok D. Sun H. Science. 2007; 315: 820-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). One potential function of the high-affinity interaction between RBP and its receptor is to help vertebrates survive vitamin A-deficient conditions, which can lower serum RBP levels. Vitamin A-deficient conditions are common for most, if not all, vertebrates living in natural environments. Furthermore, even for complete nulls, the loss of RBP and RBP receptor function does not necessarily generate the same phenotypes in the same species. For example, placental delivery of vitamin A from maternal RBP to the human embryo is very different between RBP null embryos and RBP receptor null embryos. A human embryo without the RBP receptor can be directly impacted by its loss of function in the placental absorption of vitamin A from maternal RBP. In contrast, a human embryo without RBP still has its functional RBP receptor and functional maternal RBP to ensure sufficient vitamin A delivery to the embryo through the placenta. During human evolution (including certain populations in the modern world), different human populations have dramatic differences in diet. The diet of certain human populations consists almost entirely of animal products rich in vitamin A. Because vitamin A is toxic at high concentrations, it may be advantageous to have reduced vitamin A uptake as an adaptation to this unique diet. The selective pressure on this polymorphism is likely exerted during pregnancy because too much vitamin A (as well as too little) can cause birth defects (37Collins M.D. Mao G.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1999; 39: 399-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In this study, we identified a human polymorphism in STRA6 with reduced vitamin A uptake activity. Future systematic human genetic study is necessary to determine the distribution of this polymorphism in present day human populations."
https://openalex.org/W1995345764,"We report here syntenic loci in humans and mice incorporating gene clusters coding for secreted proteins each comprising 10 cysteine residues. These conform to three-fingered protein/Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) domains that shape three-fingered proteins (TFPs). The founding gene is PATE, expressed primarily in prostate and less in testis. We have identified additional human PATE-like genes (PATE-M, PATE-DJ, and PATE-B) that co-localize with the PATE locus, code for novel secreted PATE-like proteins, and show selective expression in prostate and/or testis. Anti-PATE-B-specific antibodies demonstrated the presence of PATE-B in the region of the sperm acrosome and at high levels on malignant prostatic epithelial cells. The syntenic mouse Pate-like locus encompasses 14 active genes coding for secreted proteins, which are all, except for Pate-P and Pate-Q, expressed primarily in prostate and/or testis. Pate-P and Pate-Q are expressed solely in placental tissue. Castration up-regulates prostate expression of mouse Pate-B and Pate-E, whereas testosterone ablates this induced expression. The sequence similarity between TFP/Ly-6/uPAR proteins that modulate activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and the PATE (Pate)-like proteins stimulated us to see whether these proteins possess analogous activity. Pharmacological studies showed significant modulation of the nicotinic acetylcholines by the PATE-B, Pate-C, and Pate-P proteins. In concert with these findings, certain PATE (Pate)-like genes were extensively expressed in neuron-rich tissues. Taken together, our findings indicate that in addition to participation of the PATE (Pate)-like genes in functions related to fertility and reproduction, some of them likely act as important modulators of neural transmission.

Taken together, our findings indicate that in addition to participation of the PATE (Pate)-like genes in functions related to fertility and reproduction, some of them likely act as important modulators of neural transmission. A functional genomic approach has identified a gene, designated PATE, that codes for a secreted protein with preferential prostate and testis expression (1Bera T.K. Maitra R. Iavarone C. Salvatore G. Kumar V. Vincent J.J. Sathyanarayana B.K. Duray P. Lee B.K. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3058-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PATE protein includes 10 cysteine residues, with the C-terminal cysteine residue positioned within a cysteine-asparagine (CN) dipeptide sequence. The distribution of cysteine residues conforms to a consensus cysteine pattern found in a large family of three-fingered proteins (TFPs), 3The abbreviations used are: TFP, three-fingered protein; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; RT, reverse transcription; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; h, human; m, mouse; d, dog; TEV, tomato etch virus; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; DHT, dihydroxytestosterone. 3The abbreviations used are: TFP, three-fingered protein; uPAR, urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor; ACh, acetylcholine; nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; RT, reverse transcription; GPI, glycosylphosphatidylinositol; h, human; m, mouse; d, dog; TEV, tomato etch virus; PNGase F, peptide:N-glycosidase F; DHT, dihydroxytestosterone. characterized by a distinct disulfide bonding pattern between 8 and 10 cysteine residues (2Fry B.G.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This domain is additionally found in uPAR and murine Ly-6 GPI-anchored proteins, and is also called an Ly-6/uPAR domain (3Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the TFP architecture is seen also in the transforming growth factor-β receptor family of proteins, including BMP2 and activin receptors (4Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A large protein family encompassing an extensive group of GPI-anchored, transmembrane, and secreted proteins contains this domain. The prototype-secreted protein members of this family include short chain snake and frog toxins, which in many cases bind with high affinity to neuronal receptors and block their activity (5Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. FEBS Lett. 2004; 557: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Tremeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Menez A. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16458-16464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Until recently, the only recognized secreted mammalian TFP/Ly-6/uPAR proteins were SLURP-1 (secreted mammalian Ly-6/uPAR-related protein) (8Adermann K. Wattler F. Wattler S. Heine G. Meyer M. Forssmann W.G. Nehls M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 810-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and SLURP-2 (9Tsuji H. Okamoto K. Matsuzaka Y. Iizuka H. Tamiya G. Inoko H. Genomics. 2003; 81: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which are located on human chromosome 8q24.3 within a cluster of Ly-6-like human genes that otherwise code for GPI-linked proteins. Consistent with the putative ligand function of some secreted TFP/Ly-6/uPAR proteins, SLURP-1 was recently identified as a neuromodulator of the α7 nicotinic receptor (α7 nAChR), suggesting that it may regulate calcium homeostasis (10Chimienti F. Hogg R.C. Plantard L. Lehmann C. Brakch N. Fischer J. Huber M. Bertrand D. Hohl D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 3017-3024Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is clear that members of the secreted TFP/Ly-6/uPAR protein family, to which the PATE protein belongs, interact with partner proteins that, in many cases, are membrane-tethered receptors. The human PATE gene is telomerically juxtaposed to the gene encoding acrosomal vesicle protein 1 (ACRV1), also known as the SP10 gene (11Freemerman A.J. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ACRV1 protein also contains 10 cysteine residues that conform to the TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain, suggesting that the two genes ACRV1 and PATE may be part of a single chromosomal locus comprising TFP/Ly-6/uPAR genes. In this study, we report the identification and expression patterns of three additional human PATE-like genes (PATE-M, PATE-DJ, and PATE-B) that co-localize with the ACRV1 and PATE genomic locus. These novel PATE-like genes code for secreted proteins containing the typical TFP/Ly-6/uPAR domain. Significantly, all show selective expression in prostate and/or testis. We have identified the orthologous murine Pate, Pate-M, Pate-DJ, and Pate-B genes that localize centromerically to the mouse Acrv1/sp10 gene. Remarkably, the mouse Pate-like genomic locus includes an additional nine transcriptionally active Pate-like genes, which all encode secreted TFP/Ly-6/uPAR-domain-containing proteins, whereas in the human genome these mouse Pate-like genes are either inactive (two genes) or completely absent (the remaining seven genes). Selective expression of the mouse Pate-like genes in prostate, testis, placenta as well as specific effects of castration and subsequent testosterone administration on their expression in prostate all indicate that these genes function in both male- and female-related reproductive activities and are likely hormonally regulated. Furthermore, because of the sequence similarity between TFP/Ly-6/uPAR proteins that modulate activity of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and the PATE (Pate)-like proteins, we conducted experiments to see whether these proteins also possess comparable activity. These analyses showed that certain PATE (Pate)-like proteins modulate the activity of nAChRs. Taken together, our findings indicate that in addition to participation of the PATE (Pate)-like genes in functions related to fertility and reproduction, they are likely to function as important modulators of neural activity. Materials and Antibodies—Unless otherwise specified, chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. The anti-FLAG antibodies were affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Fresh ACh stock solutions were made daily in Ringer's solution and diluted. RT-PCR Analyses of the Human and Mouse PATE (Pate)-like Genes—Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were synthesized using the DNA sequences obtained from the PATE (Pate)-like sequences (see under “Bioinformatic Strategies for Identification of PATE (Pate)-like Genes”). RT-PCR analysis of the human PATE-like genes (and flanking genes) as well as the mouse Pate-like genes was performed with cDNAs obtained from different human or mouse tissues (Clontech) as indicated. Forward and reverse primers were chosen such that they always spanned an intron, and the observed RT-PCR product at all times corresponded to the size expected of a spliced mRNA. Sequencing of PATE (Pate)-like cDNAs—All human PATE-like cDNAs were either directly sequenced from gel-purified RT-PCR DNAs or alternatively the gel-purified cDNAs were cloned into TOPO4 (Invitrogen) plasmids and then sequenced. For the mouse Pate-like cDNAs, RT-PCR generated DNAs were gel-purified and directly sequenced. Bioinformatic Strategies for Identification of PATE (Pate)-like Genes—The sequence homology among the TFP family of proteins is generally low except for the common pattern of cysteines in the sequence, and an initial attempt to identify PATE-like genes by using conventional protein homolog search programs such as BLAST or BLAT was not successful. However, a careful inspection of protein sequences and exon structures of initially identified PATE and PATE-like genes enabled us to devise a method to detect PATE-like genes in the genomic sequences. We developed two protein sequence patterns, P1 and P2, to represent C1-C5 and C6-C10N patterns, respectively, found in PATE-like proteins. The two patterns are “CX(2)CX(5,10)CX(3,8)CX(4,9)C” for P1 and “CX(2,4)CX(11,20)CCX(2,7)C” for P2, where X(n,m) denotes a stretch of any amino acids ranging in length from n to m. The patterns were reverse-translated and transformed to Perl regular expressions. We searched the genomic locus bounded by PKNOX2 and CDON genes in the human genome (May 2004 freeze) and orthologous loci in the mouse genome (May 2004 freeze), in the rat genome (June 2003 freeze), and in the dog genome (July 2004 freeze). Two exons bearing P1 and P2, respectively, were separately searched. Then, closely (less than 10 kb) located P1 and P2 pairs were joined to form single genes. In human and mouse, the precise exon boundaries were predicted by manually inspecting all possible intron-exon boundaries for those that will maintain the open reading frame and the experimentally determined protein sequence. The corresponding signal peptide-bearing exon was located in the 5′-flanking region of each gene. The putative gene structure was verified by expressed sequence tag search, by comparing each gene with a respective ortholog in human or mouse, or experimentally by RT-PCR, cloning, and sequencing. Possible orthologous relationships among PATE-like genes from human, mouse, rat, and dog were inferred by a phylogenetic analysis using MEGA3 program (12Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Brief. Bioinform. 2004; 5: 150-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10641) Google Scholar) based on a multiple sequence alignment of P1 and P2 sequences obtained by using T-Coffee program (13Notredame C. Higgins D.G. Heringa J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). Generation of Eucaryotic Expression Constructs and Fusion Proteins—Cloning was conducted with the eucaryotic expression vector pCMV3 (Sigma) via selected restriction sites. This vector codes for the preprotrypsin signal peptide followed by sequences coding for the FLAG epitope. DNA coding for the human Fc fragment (hFc) was inserted 3′ to the FLAG epitope. A cleavage site for the highly specific tomato etch virus (TEV) protease was also introduced between the C terminus of the Pate-like proteins and the hFc segment. cDNA fragments encoding the Pate-like proteins were subcloned in-frame into the pCMV3 (5′FLAG—hFc3′) vector to render pCMV3 as 5′FLAG-Pate-like-TEV-hFc3′. Generation of HEK293 Transfectants Expressing FLAG-Pate-TEV-hFc Proteins—HEK293 (human kidney) cells were transiently transfected with the eucaryotic pCMV3 expression vectors (6 μg of DNA/25-cm2 flask) coding for the FLAG-(Pate-like)-TEV-hFc fusion proteins. The secreted C-terminally hFc tagged FLAG-Pate-like-TEV-hFc proteins contained in the conditioned media (CM) were collected on protein A-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow resin (Amersham Biosciences), and the N-terminal Pate-like proteins were released by incubating the protein A beads with TEV protease. Preparation of RNA—Human nAChR clones were obtained from Dr. Jon Lindstrom. After linearization and purification of cloned cDNAs, RNA transcripts were prepared in vitro using the appropriate mMessage mMachine kit from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—Mature (>9 cm) female Xenopus laevis African toads (Nasco, Ft. Atkinson, WI) were used as a source of oocytes. Prior to surgery, frogs were anesthetized by placing the animal in a 1.5 g/liter solution of MS222 (3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester; Sigma) for 30 min. Oocytes were removed from an incision made in the abdomen. To remove the follicular cell layer, harvested oocytes were treated with 1.25 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington) for 2 h at room temperature in calcium-free Barth's solution (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.38 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin sulfate). Subsequently, stage 5 oocytes were isolated and injected with 50 nl (5-20 ng) each of the appropriate subunit cRNAs. Recordings were made 3-5 days after injection. Electrophysiology—Experiments were conducted using OpusXpress 6000A (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) as reported previously (14Stokes C. Papke J.K.P. McCormack T. Kem W.R. Horenstein N.A. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). OpusXpress is an integrated system that provides automated impalement and voltage clamp of up to eight oocytes in parallel. Cells were automatically perfused with bath solution, and agonist solutions were delivered from a 96-well plate. Both the voltage and current electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl. The agonist solutions were applied via disposable tips, which eliminated any possibility of cross-contamination. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV. Data were collected at 50 Hz and filtered at 20 Hz. ACh applications were 8 s with 241-s wash periods. Each oocyte received two initial control applications of ACh, and then the PATE-like peptides were pre-applied for 241 s at the indicated concentrations through an alternative supply of bath solution. Subsequently the PATEs were co-applied with ACh at the control concentration. The control ACh concentrations for a7 and a4b2 receptors were 60 and 30 μm, respectively. Responses to the ACh PATE co-application were calculated relative to the preceding ACh control responses based on net charge (15Papke R.L. Porter Papke J.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2002; 137: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Net charge was integrated for the entire response, i.e. until the currents return to base line, such that the total time window for the net charge measurement was 120 s, beginning 2 s prior to the ACh delivery. Responses of at least four oocytes were measured for each experimental concentration. Statistical analyses of PATE effects were based on pairwise t test between the responses of each oocyte to ACh alone or ACh plus PATE peptide, following preincubation with the PATEs. All of the statistics were based on pairwise t tests, where responses of cells recorded under control conditions were compared on a cell by cell basis with those obtained after PATE treatment. The calculations of p values were made with Stateview version 4.01, (ABACUS Concepts, Berkeley, CA). SDS-PAGE—SDS-polyacrylamide gel for protein separation was performed as described previously (16Levitin F. Stern O. Weiss M. Gil-Henn C. Ziv R. Prokocimer Z. Smorodinsky N.I. Rubinstein D.B. Wreschner D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33374-33386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and blots were reacted with polyclonal rabbit anti-FLAG primary antibody. For glycosidase treatment, protein A-purified proteins were incubated with 1 unit of PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Identification of a Human PATE-like Gene Cluster—The PATE gene codes for a small, cysteine-rich protein selectively expressed in human male reproductive tissues, including prostate, testis, epididymis, and seminal vesicle (1Bera T.K. Maitra R. Iavarone C. Salvatore G. Kumar V. Vincent J.J. Sathyanarayana B.K. Duray P. Lee B.K. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Reproduction (Camb.). 2005; 129: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Patternsearch techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) revealed three additional PATE-like genes, designated PATE-B, PATE-M, and PATE-DJ, which localized to the same 11q24 genomic locus as the PATE gene (Fig. 1). Expression analyses of these genes by RT-PCR in 17 different human tissues demonstrated selective expression in prostatic and/or testicular tissue with negligible expression in all other tissues (Fig. 2). The PATE-B gene was expressed primarily in prostate with lesser expression in testis, whereas the PATE-M and PATE-DJ genes showed a reverse pattern of expression (Fig. 2). RT-PCR analyses of all known genes within a stretch of 700 kbp comprising the human PATE-like genes demonstrated that the non-PATE-like genes did not show preferential expression in reproductive tissues (Fig. 2). Consistent with previously published data, ACRV1 (acrosomal vesicle protein 1 gene also known as SP10) demonstrated multiple splice isoforms, expressed primarily in testicular tissue (11Freemerman A.J. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 41: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2RT-PCR expression analysis of human PATE-like genes and flanking genes. RT-PCR analysis of the human PATE-like genes and flanking genes was performed with cDNAs obtained from the indicated human tissues. Forward and reverse primers were chosen such that they always spanned an intron, and the observed RT-PCR product at all times corresponded to the size expected of a spliced mRNA. For the ACRV1, PATE, PATE-M, PATE-DJ, and PATE-B genes, the forward and reverse primers were located in the first and third exons (coding for the signal peptide and cysteines 6-10, respectively). PCR was performed for 35 cycles. Note that PIG8 (p53 induced gene 8) is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues, serving as a convenient internal control for cDNA integrity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequencing full-length cDNAs showed that the human PATE-like genes code for similar proteins that all include a putative N-terminal signal peptide (see below) and 10 conserved cysteine residues (Table 1). Comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences showed that in all PATE-like proteins the N-terminal signal peptide is encoded by the first exon (exon 1), whereas protein domains containing cysteines 1-5 and cysteines 6-10 are encoded by two separate 3′ exons (exons 2 and 3, respectively, shown in Fig. 3). For PATE and PATE-M genes, 1-2 additional exons, designated 1a and 1b, are present between exons 1 and 2 and code for a small number of amino acids. The upstream ACRV1 gene shows a similar exon structure to the PATE-like genes.TABLE 1Sequences of the human PATE-like and mouse Pate-like proteins and signal peptide predictionFIGURE 3Exon structure of PATE (Pate)-like genes. The canonical exon structure of the PATE (Pate)-like genes is presented. Optional extra exons are represented as dotted boxes. The coding region is in color: blue, signal peptide (SP); green, pattern 1 (P1) containing C1 to C5; red, pattern 2 (P2) containing C6 to C10N.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All splice events in the PATE-like genes use a +1 phase (Fig. 3); thus alternative splicing involving exon skipping will not alter downstream reading frames. Interestingly, PATE-B and PATE-M generate two splice isoforms (Fig. 2). Cloning and sequencing of the smaller transcripts confirmed that they derive from exon 2 skipping. Both isoforms include the putative N-terminal signal peptide, but although the larger transcript codes for proteins comprising all 10 cysteine residues, the smaller transcript codes only for cysteines 6-10. Prediction of Signal Peptides at the N Terminus of All Human PATE-like Genes—As expected of signal peptide sequences, analysis of all human PATE-like genes reveals clustering of hydrophobic amino acid residues just distal to the initiating methionine (Table 1). Analysis by the SignalP (signal peptide prediction) algorithm predicts with very high probability a signal peptide and accompanying cleavage site for each PATE-like protein (Table 1). That this N-terminal region is in fact a signal peptide directing protein for secretion has been functionally demonstrated for PATE (17Soler-Garcia A.A. Maitra R. Kumar V. Ise T. Nagata S. Beers R. Bera T.K. Pastan I. Reproduction (Camb.). 2005; 129: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and ACRV1 (SP10) (18Herr J.C. Wright R.M. John E. Foster J. Kays T. Flickinger C.J. Biol. Reprod. 1990; 42: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and it is very likely that these regions serve the same function in the PATE-B, PATE-DJ, and PATE-M proteins. By transfecting human HEK293 cells with cDNA coding for the native PATE-B protein and analyzing spent culture medium for the presence of PATE-B protein, we have experimentally confirmed (data not shown) that the native PATE-B protein is indeed secreted from the cell. Northern Blot Analysis of PATE-B and PATE-M Expression—To extend and confirm the RT-PCR analyses, Northern blot analyses of PATE-B and PATE-DJ were performed (Fig. 4). This demonstrated exclusive expression, albeit at low levels, of PATE-B and PATE-DJ in prostate and testis, respectively, confirming the RT-PCR analyses; no other tissues expressed these genes. Additional Vestigial Inactive PATE-like Genes in the Human PATE-like Gene Cluster—Searches for additional human PATE-like genes within the human gene cluster revealed two potential PATE-like genes, designated PATE-A and PATE-C (Fig. 1). Extensive RT-PCR analyses using a number of forward and reverse primers based on these genomic sequences failed, in all tissues examined, to reveal expression of these genes. Identification of 14 Active Mouse Pate-like Genes within the Mouse Genome Syntenic to the Human PATE-like Genomic Locus—The human PATE-like gene locus extends from the ACRV1 gene to the PATE-B gene, encompassing about 180 kbp. The human genes adjacent to the PATE-like gene locus are (centromeric → telomeric, Fig. 1A) as follows: PKNOX2, FEZ1, PIG8, ITM1, CHEK1, ACRV1, (PATE-A), (PATE-C), PATE, PATE-M, PATE-DJ, PATE-B, DDX2,5 and CDON, and this region stretches for about 700 kbp. The syntenic mouse genomic segment was identified and demonstrated the following arrangement (→ centromeric, Fig. 1B): Pknox2, Fez1, Pig8, Itm1, Chk1, Acrv1 (sp10), Svs7 (seminal vesicle secretion protein 7 (19Luo C.W.

Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20909-20915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), identified here as the mouse Pate-B ortholog), Ddx25 and Cdon (Fig. 1). Further analyses designed to identify mouse orthologs revealed the mouse Pate-A, Pate-C, Pate, Pate-M, Pate-DJ, and Pate-B (svs7) genes (Fig. 1B). An additional two potential mouse Pate-like genes, designated Pate-E and Pate-N, were identified between Pate-C and Pate. Unexpectedly, inspection of the mouse genomic Pate-like gene locus revealed 0.8 Mbp of genomic DNA situated between the mouse Acrv1 and Pate-A genes. Analysis of this segment revealed several additional Pate-like genes (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The expected human equivalent to the 0.8-Mbp mouse fragment was completely absent. All mouse Pate-like genes code for putative Pate-like proteins comprising a hydrophobic N-terminal signal peptide (Table 1). RT-PCR analyses (Fig. 5) utilizing oligonucleotide primers located in exons 2 and 3 revealed that the mouse Pate-A and Pate-C mouse genes (corresponding to the inactive human PATE-C and PATE-A genes) were clearly expressed, in addition to expression of the mouse gene orthologs Pate-B, Pate-DJ, Pate-M, and Pate. Even more striking was the discovery of an additional seven transcriptionally active mouse Pate-like genes, designated Pate-E, Pate-H, Pate-N, Pate-F, Pate-P, Pate-Q, and Pate-G (Figs. 1 and 5 and Table 1). We do not know why the syntenic mouse locus harbors so many more active Pate-like genes as compared with the human genome, but this does suggest a significantly more complex role for the Pate-like proteins in rodents. Constituent Pate-like genes could be segregated according to their tissue expression profiles (Fig. 5). Genes Pate-E, Pate-A, and Pate were predominantly expressed in both prostate and testis, whereas Pate-C and Pate-H expression was limited to prostatic tissue. Pate-N, Pate-F, and Pate-DJ showed almost exclusive expression in testis. Pate-G, Pate-B, and Pate-M all showed major expression in either prostate or testis but, in addition, showed significant expression levels in skeletal muscle (Pate-G), eye, kidney, skeletal muscle (Pate-B), and brain and lung (Pate-M). Several mouse Pate-like pseudogenes were scattered among the active mouse Pate-like genes (Fig. 1). Expression in Placental Tissue of Two Mouse Pate-like Genes—Two murine Pate-like genes, Pate-P and Pate-Q, were expressed exclusively in the female-restricted organ, mouse placenta (Fig. 5). Notably, these genes (a) are genomically adjacent to each other (Fig. 1), (b) code for highly similar proteins (Table 1), and (c) both include an 11th cysteine residue in addition to the consensus Pate-like 10 cysteine residues. Supporting placental expression reported here is a trophoblast cDNA library EST (BQ032923) representing a partial Pate-Q sequence. Castration Induces Pate-like Gene Expression in the Ventral Prostate That Is Ablated by Subsequent Dihydroxytestosterone Administration—The selective tissue distribution of Pate-like gene expression in the testis, prostate, and placenta indicated that the Pate-like proteins are likely involved in reproductive-related behavior. To see whether in vivo hormonal changes may affect Pate- like gene expression, we investigated effects of castration and subsequent dihydroxytestosterone (DHT) administration on prostate expression of the Pate-like genes. As differential gene expression has been documented in the anatomically discrete dorsal and ventral prostate lobes, we investigated Pate-like gene expression in each separate lobe. The dorsal lobe in uncastrated mice clearly expressed the two Pate-like genes, Pate-B and Pate-E (Fig. 6, DP). Dorsal lobe expression remained high, irrespective of castration and subsequent DHT administration (data not shown). In contrast, the Pate-B and Pate-E genes were"

Ablation of the gene encoding PTP1B, Ptpn1, causes tissue-specific hypersensitivity to insulin and leptin, resulting in resistance to diabetes and obesity (1Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E.

Med. 2006; 12: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). PTP1B is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that is localized to the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (3Frangioni J.V. Heahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Its catalytic domain can directly dephosphorylate and inactivate the insulin receptor and other receptor and non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (4Blanchetot C. Chagnon M. Dubé N. Hallé M. Tremblay M.L. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 35: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Despite the proto-oncogenic functions of many of these protein-tyrosine kinases, Ptpn1-null mice are not prone to tumorigenesis. On the contrary, two recent studies found that mice lacking PTP1B are markedly resistant to mammary tumorigenesis induced by active mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 (5Julien S.G. Dubé N.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2420-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The effect of PTP1B deficiency in these cancer models has highlighted its diverse cellular functions. One emerging role of PTP1B is in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Early studies in fibroblasts showed that PTP1B is required for proper cell adhesion and spreading on extracellular matrix proteins (7Cheng A. Bal G.S. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25848-25855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix is mediated largely by cell-surface integrins, which initiate signaling cascades and orchestrate changes in the actin cytoskeleton at adhesive contacts. Protein-tyrosine kinases involved in transmission of integrin signals, including c-Src (8Bjorge J.D. Pang A. Fujita D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41439-41446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), focal adhesion kinase (9Zhang Z. Lin S.Y. Neel B.G. Haimovich B. J. Biol.

Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 837-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), have been proposed as PTP1B substrates; however, none has consistently been shown to be hyperphosphorylated in the absence of PTP1B. It is tempting to speculate that, rather than regulating upstream signaling, PTP1B may directly target one or more non-protein-tyrosine kinase actin regulatory proteins. Cortactin was identified as a prominent tyrosine phosphoprotein in cells expressing the active protein-tyrosine kinase v-Src (11Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). It has subsequently been implicated in various processes requiring dynamic actin assembly, including cell adhesion and migration, vesicular transport, and microbial infection (12Buday L. Downward J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 263-273PubMed Google Scholar, 13Selbach M. Backert S. Trends Microbiol. 2005; 13: 181-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cortactin exerts its effects on the actin cytoskeleton by interacting directly with the Arp2/3 complex (via its N-terminal acidic domain) (see Fig. 3), F-actin (via a central repeat region), and other actin regulatory proteins such as N-WASP and MIM (via its C-terminal SH3 domain) (12Buday L. Downward J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 263-273PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of additional binding partners mediate the effects of cortactin in specific contexts, including receptor tyrosine kinase down-regulation and cell-cell adhesion. Cortactin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to a wide range of stimuli that induce cytoskeletal rearrangement, including growth factor stimulation, cell adhesion, and hyperosmotic stress (14Lua B.L. Low B.C. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Src phosphorylates murine cortactin predominantly at three key sites in vitro, Tyr421, Tyr466, and Tyr482 (corresponding to Tyr421, Tyr470, and Try486 in human cortactin), resulting in decreased actin cross-linking activity (15Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The combined mutation of these three residues abolishes tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in cells under various conditions (15Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 16Kapus A. Di Ciano C. Sun J. Zhan X. Kim L. Wong T.W. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol.

Nonetheless, several mass spectrometry-phosphoproteomic studies have identified additional phosphorylated tyrosine residues (18Wolf-Yadlin A. Hautaniemi S. Lauffenburger D.A. White F.M. Proc. Natl.

A number of individual phosphotyrosine sites have been reported independently in different cell types and in response to diverse stimuli, but their regulation and function remain to be investigated. In this study, we have identified cortactin as a substrate of PTP1B. A trapping mutant of PTP1B binds cortactin at a previously uncharacterized tyrosine residue, Tyr446. We show that PTP1B regulates cortactin phosphorylation induced by hyperosmolarity and that Tyr446 is required for protection from apoptosis induced by hyperosmotic stress. Our results are the first to implicate a specific PTP in the regulation of cortactin, and they reveal a novel mechanism by which PTP1B may influence the cytoskeleton. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-cortactin clone 4F11 and anti-phosphotyrosine clone 4G10 (Millipore), anti-cortactin phospho-Tyr421 (Invitrogen), anti-PTP1B clone 15 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and anti-GST (Z-5, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). An anti-cortactin polyclonal antibody (used exclusively for supplemental Fig. 1) was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. The polyclonal antibody specific for human cortactin phospho-Tyr446 was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA). Plasmids—Expression plasmids (pEBG) encoding GST-tagged human PTP1B (WT and D181A) were described previously (25Simoncic P.D. Lee-Loy A. Barber D.L. Tremblay M.L. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 446-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To prepare additional GST-tagged PTP constructs, cDNAs from pEF-BOS-TCPTP (WT and D182A) and pcDNA4-PTP-PEST (WT and D199A) were amplified by PCR, introducing BamHI (5′) and NotI (3′) sites, and subsequently subcloned into the pEBG vector. Untagged expression constructs (pcDNA3) encoding human WT cortactin and mutants Y421F, Y470F, and Y486F were a kind gift of Dr. Scott Weed (West Virginia University). Additional cortactin mutants were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene). Plasmids used for expression of untagged human PTP1B (WT or C215S, pcDNA3.1) were described previously (26Stuible M. Zhao L. Aubry I. Schmidt-Arras D. Bohmer F.D. Li C.J. Tremblay M.L. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Insert sequences of all constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. 5The sequences of primers used for cloning and mutagenesis are available on request. Substrate Trapping—Cell lines were routinely maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (all from Invitrogen). For trapping of endogenous cortactin, HeLa or COS-7 cells (plated at 5 × 105 cells/6-cm dish) were transfected with 4.8 μg of DNA (4 μg of pEBG-PTP1B and 0.8 μg of v-Src or a control empty vector) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. For GST-PTP/cortactin coexpression experiments, COS-7 cells (2.5 × 105/well in 6-well plates) were transfected with 1 μg of pEBG-PTP and 1 μg of pcDNA3-cortactin DNA. GST pulldown assays were performed as described (27Cheng A. Uetani N. Simoncic P.D. Chaubey V.P. Lee-Loy A. McGlade C.J. Kennedy B.P. Tremblay M.L. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 497-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). EGF and Sucrose Stimulation—For overexpression experiments, HeLa cells (total of 106 cells/12-well plate) were transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-cortactin (WT or Y446F), pcDNA3.1-PTP1B (WT or C215S), or a control empty vector (pcDNA3.1) and grown for 36 h in normal growth medium. Cells were then serum-starved in DMEM for 4 h prior to treatment with hyperosmotic sucrose (300 mm sucrose in DMEM) or human EGF (100 nm; R&D Systems). For inhibitor experiments, untransfected HeLa cells were serum-starved for 2 h in DMEM followed by 2 h in DMEM containing a cell-permeable PTP1B inhibitor (5 μm final concentration) as described previously (28Montalibet J. Skorey K. McKay D. Scapin G. Asante-Appiah E. Kennedy B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5258-5266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The hyperosmotic sucrose medium used for cell stimulation contained the same concentration of inhibitor. For all experiments, cells were lysed, and protein extracts were analyzed by immunoblotting as described previously (26Stuible M. Zhao L. Aubry I. Schmidt-Arras D. Bohmer F.D. Li C.J. Tremblay M.L. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Assays—HeLa cells plated in 6-cm dishes were transfected with pcDNA3-cortactin (WT or Y446F). At 24 h post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and seeded at 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cells were allowed to adhere for 10 h and subsequently serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM for 16 h prior to treatment with hyperosmotic sucrose (300 mm in DMEM). At the indicated time points, caspase activity was measured using the luminescent Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Identification of Cortactin as a PTP1B Substrate—To identify novel PTP1B substrates, a cell-based pulldown assay was employed in which GST-tagged WT PTP1B or mutant D181A was coexpressed in COS-7 cells with v-Src. The interaction of WT PTP1B with its substrates is normally transient. Asp181 is a critical catalytic residue, and the D181A trapping mutant is able to form a stable, covalently linked complex with phosphorylated target proteins. The proteins bound to these two forms of PTP1B were purified using glutathione beads. As expected, the total cell lysate of COS-7 cells expressing v-Src contained numerous tyrosine phosphoproteins, as demonstrated by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 1A, third lane). Although WT PTP1B did not associate significantly with any of these proteins (first lane), the D181A mutant bound preferentially to two phosphoproteins of ∼80 and ∼65 kDa (second lane). By immunoblotting for candidate substrates, we found that cortactin bound PTP1B D181A and that its molecular mass precisely matches the ∼80-kDa protein we had detected by anti-phosphotyrosine blotting. The trapping mutant of PTP1B was able to bind endogenous cortactin in both HeLa and COS-7 cells (Fig. 1B). The form of cortactin expressed in COS-7 (monkey) cells migrated somewhat slower than that in HeLa (human) cells. An alternative antibody that selectively detects human cortactin was used to confirm binding of PTP1B D181A to cortactin in HeLa cells (supplemental Fig. 1). In both cell types, expression of v-Src enhanced, but was not required, for the cortactin-PTP1B interaction, suggesting that the basal phosphorylation of cortactin is sufficient for binding. An association of WT PTP1B with cortactin was never detected, even after long exposures, indicating that like many of its substrates, cortactin and WT PTP1B do not form a stable complex. PTP1B belongs to the family of 38 classical, phosphotyrosine-specific PTPs (29Alonso A. Sasin J. Bottini N. Friedberg I. Osterman A. Godzik A. Hunter T. Dixon J. Mustelin T. Cell. 2004; 117: 699-711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1491) Google Scholar). We examined the specificity of the cortactin-PTP1B interaction by testing the binding of cortactin to two other classical PTPs, TCPTP and PTP-PEST. TCPTP is the most similar enzyme to PTP1B, and although it is predominantly nuclearly localized, many of its known substrates, including receptor tyrosine kinases and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factors, overlap with PTP1B (4Blanchetot C. Chagnon M. Dubé N. Hallé M. Tremblay M.L. Methods (San Diego). 2005; 35: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). PTP-PEST is a cytoplasmic PTP that is a well established regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. The WT and trapping mutant forms of PTP1B, TCPTP, and PTP-PEST were coexpressed as GST fusion proteins in COS-7 cells with WT cortactin (Fig. 2). After precipitation using glutathione beads, bound cortactin was detected only in cells expressing PTP1B D181A. Thus, among the candidate enzymes tested, the ability to interact with cortactin is specific to PTP1B. Mapping of the Cortactin-PTP1B Interaction—To localize the PTP1B-binding site on cortactin, we tested whether cortactin deletion mutants lacking the SH3 domain or the entire C terminus (Fig. 3A) could be trapped by PTP1B D181A. Despite potential interactions between the cortactin SH3 domain and the PTP1B proline-rich motifs, the ΔSH3 mutant retained binding to PTP1B (Fig. 3B). Similarly, deletion of either proline-rich motif of PTP1B D181A did not impair its ability to pull down cortactin (data not shown). In contrast, deletion of the cortactin C terminus, including the SH3 and α-helical/proline-rich regions, prevented the binding of PTP1B (Fig. 3B). The α-helical/proline-rich region contains a cluster of tyrosine residues including the canonical Src sites (Fig. 3A). Tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutants were generated for each of these residues, and binding to PTP1B D181A was assessed after cotransfection. Strikingly, mutation of a single tyrosine residue, Tyr446, nearly abolished the interaction (Fig. 3C). The results of independent binding assays were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, mutants at two of the Src sites, Y421F and Y486F, displayed comparable binding to PTP1B D181A, whereas another Src site mutant, Y470F, as well as Y464F and Y489F, had intermediate effects on the interaction. These data strongly suggest that Tyr446 is the primary binding site, whereas additional residues may indirectly affect binding, perhaps by altering the phosphorylation state of Tyr446. Development of a Phospho-specific Antibody for Cortactin Tyr446—Phosphoproteomic studies have identified cortactin peptides phosphorylated at Tyr446 (18Wolf-Yadlin A. Hautaniemi S. Lauffenburger D.A.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5058-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and multiple species alignment of cortactin protein sequences indicates that Tyr446 has been evolutionarily conserved (Fig. 4A). These results suggest that Tyr446 is a functionally important site for the regulation of cortactin. To evaluate the role of PTP1B in modulating cortactin phosphorylation, a polyclonal antibody for human cortactin phospho-Tyr446 was prepared by immunization of rabbits with a corresponding phosphopeptide (Fig. 4A). The specificity of the anti-phospho-Tyr446 antibody was tested using lysates from transfected HeLa cells treated with EGF. The overexpressed cortactin, which corresponds to the long isoform of the human protein (30van Rossum A.G. de Graaf J.H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Kluin P.M. Fan Y.X. Zhan X. Moolenaar W.H. Schuuring E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45672-45679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), migrated slightly slower on SDS-polyacrylamide gel than the endogenous form expressed in these cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that the antibody bound endogenous and overexpressed WT cortactin, but not the overexpressed Y446F mutant (Fig. 4B). The reactivity of the antibody with cortactin was increased with EGF treatment, reaching a maximum at a stimulation time of 15 min. These results confirm that Tyr446 is a target of EGF signaling and that this novel phospho-specific antibody is specific for this site. PTP1B Regulates Cortactin Tyrosine Phosphorylation—In initial experiments, we found that PTP1B overexpression dramatically decreased cortactin phosphorylation in response to EGF (data not shown). However, the EGF receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinases that promote cortactin phosphorylation are themselves substrates of PTP1B. Thus, the effect of PTP1B overexpression in this context is likely due to its cumulative activity on upstream receptor tyrosine kinases as well as on cortactin itself. Hyperosmotic media can potently induce tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin independently of receptor tyrosine kinases. Cell shrinkage caused by hyperosmolarity leads to successive activation of the Fyn and Fer cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinases (16Kapus A. Di Ciano C. Sun J. Zhan X. Kim L. Wong T.W. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32289-32298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Activated Fer was believed to phosphorylate cortactin at the previously identified Src sites, Tyr421, Tyr470, and Tyr486, because mutation of these residues abrogates hyperosmolarity-induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation (16Kapus A. Di Ciano C. Sun J. Zhan X. Kim L. Wong T.W. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32289-32298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, our results show that Tyr446 is also targeted under these conditions: treatment with hyperosmotic sucrose induced Tyr446 phosphorylation in HeLa cells expressing WT cortactin (endogenous or overexpressed) (Fig. 5A). Immunoblotting with an antibody specific for Tyr421 showed that, as expected, this site was also phosphorylated in response to hyperosmolarity. Notably, we found that the Y446F mutation resulted in decreased Tyr421 phosphorylation (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the phosphorylation state of these residues is interdependent. To establish the role of PTP1B in this process, we tested whether altering its expression or activity affects hyperosmolarity-induced cortactin phosphorylation. Transient overexpression of WT PTP1B reduced phosphorylation at both Tyr446 and Tyr421 (Fig. 5B), whereas an inactive mutant of PTP1B (C215S) had no effect. Correspondingly, preincubation of cells with a membrane-permeable PTP1B inhibitor enhanced hyperosmolarity-induced phosphorylation of these sites (Fig. 5C). Quantitation of data from multiple experiments showed that inhibitor treatment resulted in an ∼50% increase in Tyr446 phosphorylation at the basal level and after stimulation with hyperosmotic sucrose (Fig. 5D). Thus, the cellular effects of PTP1B overexpression and inhibition are consistent with its characterization as a cortactin phosphatase. Mutation of Cortactin Tyr446 Increases Hyperosmolarity-induced Apoptosis—Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is a protective mechanism in cells exposed to a hyperosmotic environment. Nonetheless, prolonged exposure leads to apoptotic cell death in a variety of cell types (31Burg M.B. Ferraris J.D. Dmitrieva N.I. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1441-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that a single tyrosine residue on the protein-tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase, phosphorylated during hyperosmotic stress, is important for protection from apoptosis (32Lunn J.A. Jacamo R. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10370-10379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Because cortactin is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to hyperosmolarity (33Di Ciano C. Nie Z. Szaszi K. Lewis A. Uruno T. Zhan X. Rotstein O.D. Mak A. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C850-C865Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we investigated whether cortactin Tyr446 could also play a cytoprotective role. Hyperosmotic sucrose induced apoptosis in HeLa cells as indicated by robust caspase-3/7 activation (Fig. 6A). After a 6-h treatment, transient overexpression of cortactin Y446F resulted in a significant ∼30% increase in caspase activation compared with cells overexpressing the WT protein (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that mutation of Tyr446 potentiates apoptotic signaling in HeLa cells under hyperosmotic stress. The effect of PTP1B on the onset of diabetes, obesity, and breast tumorigenesis in mice has focused attention on its potential as a therapeutic target. However, the mechanisms by which it accomplishes some of its known cellular functions, including the modulation of cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, remain unclear. Here, we have shown that the actin regulatory protein cortactin is a target of PTP1B. In COS-7 cells expressing v-Src, the D181A trapping mutant of PTP1B binds selectively to cortactin, at ∼80 kDa, and a second protein of ∼65 kDa. This degree of specificity is remarkable considering the multitude of tyrosine phosphoproteins present in these cells and the numerous known substrates of PTP1B. Previously, our laboratory identified p62Dok as a PTP1B substrate in mouse fibroblasts using a similar approach (34Dubé N. Cheng A. Tremblay M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1834-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, on the basis of immunoblotting data (not shown), we suspect that the ∼65-kDa protein is not p62Dok, and we are currently investigating its identity. The ability of PTP1B to bind cortactin is not shared by the related enzymes TCPTP and PTP-PEST. The specificity of the cortactin-PTP1B interaction is further demonstrated by the fact that their binding depends largely on a single tyrosine residue, Tyr446. Published phosphoproteomic data provide convincing evidence that cortactin Tyr446 is a bona fide phosphorylation site: phospho-Tyr446 peptides have been detected following activation or overexpression of receptor tyrosine kinases (18Wolf-Yadlin A.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5058-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Here, using immunological methods, we have confirmed that Tyr446 is a target of EGF receptor signaling and shown that it is also phosphorylated in response to hyperosmotic stress. There is evidence that cortactin is phosphorylated in a progressive manner, with phospho-Tyr421 potentially acting as a docking site for Src, allowing it to phosphorylate Tyr470 (35Head J.A. Jiang D. Li M. Zorn L.J. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Weed S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3216-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). However, it seems unlikely that Tyr446 represents an additional secondary site. First, mass spectrometry studies have identified, in several cases, Tyr446 as the sole tyrosine-phosphorylated cortactin residue (20Hinsby A.M. Olsen J.V. Bennett K.L. Mann M. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 29-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Wolf-Yadlin A. Ross P.L. Pappin D.J. Rush J. Lauffenburger D.A. White F.M. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5058-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Second, our results show that in response to hyperosmolarity, the phosphorylation state of Tyr421 is dependent on the presence of Tyr446. Correspondingly, although the trapping mutant of PTP1B binds to Tyr446 and not Tyr421, inhibition of PTP1B or overexpression of the WT enzyme affects both residues. Finally, we have shown that Tyr446 is required for protection of cells from hyperosmolarity-induced apoptosis, pointing to the potential importance of this single residue in the regulation of actin remodeling. In future studies, we plan to investigate further the interrelationship between Tyr446 and the canonical Src sites as well as whether particular effectors of cortactin function depend on Tyr446 phosphorylation. An exciting possibility is that the regulation of cortactin could contribute to the effect of PTP1B on breast tumorigenesis in mice (5Julien S.G. Dubé N. Read M. Penney J. Paquet M. Han Y. Kennedy B.P. Muller W.J. Tremblay M.L. Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 6Bentires-Alj M. Neel B.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2420-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Amplification of a genomic region containing EMS1, encoding human cortactin, is associated with human cancer, and cortactin has been implicated in the promotion of tumor cell migration and invasion (12Buday L. Downward J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1775: 263-273PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether expression of cortactin Y446F affects the tumorigenicity of cancer cells. Nonetheless, deciphering the specific importance of PTP1B-mediated cortactin regulation in this process will be a challenge, given the pleiotropic effects of this enzyme on cancer cell signaling. Potentially, the phosphorylation state of Tyr446 could also be used as an in vivo reporter to monitor the effectiveness of PTP1B-targeted therapies. In conclusion, we have shown that PTP1B regulates cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation, likely by directly dephosphorylating Tyr446. This is the first report implicating a specific enzyme in the modification of this site, and it also establishes its functional significance in the protection of cells during hyperosmotic stress. On the basis of these results and published phosphoproteomic data, we propose that the current model of cortactin regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation, which holds that Tyr421, Tyr470, and Tyr486 are of primary importance, should be revised to include Tyr446. Furthermore, this study suggests a novel mechanism by which PTP1B may affect a variety of cellular processes, including tumorigenesis, through regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.

Veena Sangwan and Morag Park for suggestions and for critical reading of the manuscript, and Dr. Scott Weed for providing the human cortactin expression plasmids.

Genotyping of 100 patients revealed that in a third of them who harbor missense mutations in the GLUT1 transporter, transmembrane domain 4 (TM4), encoded by SLC2A1 exon IV, contains mutant residues that have the periodicity of one face of a kinked α-helix. Arg-126, located at the amino terminus of TM4, is the locus for most of the mutations followed by other arginine and glycine residues located elsewhere in the transporter but conserved among MFS proteins. The Arg-126 mutants were constructed and assayed for protein expression, targeting, and transport capacity in Xenopus oocytes. The role of charge at position 126, as well as its accessibility, was investigated in R126H by determining its activity as a function of extracellular pH. The results indicate that intracellular charges at the MFS TM2–3 and TM8–9 signature loops and flanking TMs 3, 5, and 6 are critical for the structure of GLUT1 as are TM glycines and that TM4, located at the catalytic core of MFS proteins, forms a helix that surfaces into the extracellular solution where another proton facilitates transport.

Transporters exposed to extracellular or intracellular solutions make available recognition sites for the binding of nutrients, neurotransmitters, ions, and other molecules and then allow the emergence and release of bound substrate at the opposite side of the membrane. In the case of facilitative transporters, binding to either side of the transporter initiates translocation, but net flow across an ensemble of transporters over a period of time is driven by substrate concentration gradients across the cell independently of other cellular energy sources.MFS proteins are loosely related in primary structure, but they probably fold similarly (1Abramson J. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 2Vardy E. Arkin I.T. Gottschalk K.E. Kaback H.R. Schuldiner S. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1832-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The structure of three MFS transporters has been solved: LacY (transporter classification (TC) 2.A.1.5.1) at 3.5-Å resolution (3Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), GltP (TC 2.A.1.4.3) at 3.3-Å (4Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar), and OxlT (TC 2.A.1.11.1) at 6.5-Å (5Hirai T. Heymann J.A. Shi D. Sarker R. Maloney P.C. Subramaniam S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 597-600PubMed Google Scholar) (for the TC system, see Ref. 6Busch W. Saier Jr., M.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2002; 37: 287-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and the Transport Classification Database (7Saier Jr., M.H. Tran C.V. Barabote R.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D181-D186Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar)). Their architectures are superimposable: the transporters contain 12 transmembrane helices arranged in two six-helical quasisymmetrical domains situated around a transport pathway normal to the plane of the membrane. A set of the helices lines a central catalytic cavity. In the case of LacY (or lactose permease, a lactose/H+ cotransporter), the helices located at the catalytic core interact with water-avid substrate to provide a stabilizing network of hydrogen bonds, van der Waals interactions, and hydrophobic residues capable of decreasing substrate dissociation after binding (3Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). This transient substrate stabilization then probably mobilizes adjacent helices, facilitating translocation across the membrane.GLUT1 (TC 2.A.1.1.28), encoded by the SLC2A1 gene, transports glucose in and out of many normal tissues and tumors, including erythrocytes (RBCs) and cerebral endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (8Uldry M. Thorens B. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). GLUT1 is densely expressed in the RBC membrane where it self-associates and exhibits modulated kinetics (9Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23829-23838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood-brain barrier GLUT1, which mediates the entry of glucose into the nervous system and thus supplies most of the carbon and energy that the brain consumes, is less well characterized kinetically (10Vannucci S.J. Maher F. Simpson I.A. Glia. 1997; 21: 2-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). A topological model based on hydropathy analysis (11Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) has been validated by the study of glycosylation mutants, establishing GLUT1 as a canonical 12-transmembrane domain MFS class member (12Hresko R.C. Kruse M. Strube M. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20482-20488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GLUT1 is about 80% α-helical as also established by circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (13Chin J.J. Jung E.K. Chen V. Jung C.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4113-4116Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Chin J.J. Jung E.K. Jung C.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7101-7104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the pattern of reactivity of substituted cysteines in several transmembrane domains is consistent with helical folding (15Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39562-39568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the experimental evidence converges on the prediction that the structure of the transmembrane core of GLUT1 closely resembles that of MFS (LacY, GltP, and OxlT) proteins.The study of pathological mutants offers a complementary window to the identification of residues and regions of unrecognized relevance. Amino acid-replacing (missense) mutants that retain correct folding and targeting are of particular value as they single out residues important for function. Homozygous SLC2A1 mutation causing GLUT1 absence is incompatible with embryonic survival because of the central role of GLUT1-mediated glucose transport during development (16Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Mao X. Cheng J. Yoo J. Noebels J.L. De Vivo D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 1169-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In contrast, heterozygous mutations cause encephalopathy (17Seidner G. Alvarez M.G. Yeh J.I. O'Driscoll K.R. Klepper J. Stump T.S. Wang D. Spinner N.B. Birnbaum M.J. De Vivo D.C. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Patients afflicted by classic, severe GLUT1 deficiency (18Pascual J.M. Wang D. Hinton V. Engelstad K. Saxena C.M. Van Heertum R.L. De Vivo D.C. Arch. Neurol. 2007; 64: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) manifest varying degrees of epilepsy, mental retardation, and other neurological abnormalities and share two characteristic indicators of GLUT1 transporter dysfunction: diminished cerebrospinal fluid glucose (hypoglycorrhachia) and reduced glucose uptake by the cerebrum detectable by positron emission tomography (19Pascual J.M. Wang D. Lecumberri B. Yang H. Mao X. Yang R. De Vivo D.C. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 150: 627-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 20Pascual J.M. Van Heertum R.L. Wang D. Engelstad K. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).We set out to first identify residues essential for transport by identifying and genotyping 100 GLUT1 deficiency syndrome patients. A third of them (33 of 100) carried missense mutations that were distributed among any one of the 10 SLC2A1 exons with the peculiarity that, of these, nearly a third of patients (13 of 33) harbored mutations in exon IV. The rest of the patients (67 of 100) exhibited a broad variety of sequence variations not associated with single amino acid replacement and therefore were less informative from a structural point of view. Exon IV is particularly notable because it encodes the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) of GLUT1, an important domain of MFS proteins given its proximity to the transport pathway that, in the case of LacY, interacts with substrate (3Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V. Verner G. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Science. 2003; 301: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). The data support the notion that GLUT1 TM4 exists as an α-helix because it exhibits a periodic mutation pattern that is consistent with this folding, and we infer that the side of the helix where the mutations are located provides a surface that is essential for catalysis.To probe the topology of TM4 relative to the membrane, we then tested the susceptibility of R126H, a naturally occurring mutant located near the amino end of TM4, to protonation from the extracellular solution and also analyzed other charged and neutral side chain substitutes of this residue. We found that Arg-126 is exposed at the extracellular aspect of the transporter and that a charge at this position facilitates glucose transport.Additional missense mutations eliminated conserved glycines and replaced charged intracellular residues delimiting TMs 3, 4, 5, and 6 and arginines situated in the TM2–3 and TM8–9 loops, which are part of the two RXGRR signature motifs present in the MFS (21Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Maiden M.C. Davis E.O. Baldwin S.A. Moore D.C. Henderson P.J. Nature. 1987; 325: 641-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). These findings support the folding of TM4 as an α-helix and highlight the essential function of protein charges located at transporter-membrane boundaries.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPatient Identification, RBC Glucose Uptake, and Genotyping— All contacts established with and information obtained about human subjects followed procedures approved by the Institutional Review Board of Columbia University and were voluntarily provided. Patients were identified on the basis of clinical and analytical criteria including infantile epilepsy and hypoglycorrhachia with diminished lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid among other symptoms and parameters compatible with the diagnosis of GLUT1 deficiency (23Wang D. Pascual J.M. Yang H. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Sun R.P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 57: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).RBC glucose uptake assays were performed in suspected patients using two control blood samples, which were sometimes obtained from the proband's normal parents, and were simultaneously drawn to avoid assay variability, a phenomenon that occurs when blood is subjected to shipping or storage (24Klepper J. Garcia-Alvarez M. O'Driscoll K.R. Parides M.K. Wang D. Ho Y.Y. De Vivo D.C. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 1999; 13: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Blood was collected in sodium heparin or citrate-phosphatedextrose tubes. Zero-trans uptake of a fixed concentration of glucose below the apparent transport Km over time used 14C-labeled 3-O-methyl-d-glucose (3OMG; 0.5 mm, 1 μCi/ml) and was measured at 4 °C and pH 7.4 in duplicate. Influx was terminated at 5-s intervals starting at 0 s (no label added) and ending at 30 s. Washed cells were lysed, and retained radiolabel was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. The slope of the plot of ln(1 - Ct/Ceq) over time, where Ct represents red cell label and Ceq represents isotope specific activity, was used to estimate uptake. Uptake of a series of glucose concentrations (0, 0.6, 1, 1.33, 2, 4, and 6 mm) during 15 s was similarly measured in quartets of identical samples. Typically the S.E. of the radioactive counts obtained from repeat samples did not exceed 6%. Apparent Km and Vmax values were obtained from Lineweaver-Burke plots with regression coefficients r generally greater than 0.96.Genomic DNA was obtained from each patient and control blood sample and sequenced over the entire SLC2A1 coding region over all introns except 1 (which spans 15,312 bp) and over all intron-exon boundaries. Sequencing was performed on both DNA strands. All patients carried one mutation in one allele except where noted, and control blood from relatives was devoid of mutation except where indicated. After confirmatory RBC assay and genetic analysis of at least one proband per family, the rest of the familial cases sharing typical symptomatology were confirmed only by genotyping.Recombinant DNA and Oocyte Culture—Subcloning of human GLUT1 in a custom plasmid, GLUT1/pM, was achieved by cloning a 1913-base pair Eco47III and HindIII GLUT1 cDNA restriction fragment derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) into a vector (pM) containing fragments of the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of the Xenopus β-globin gene to enhance expression. Substitutions R126H, R126K, R126E, R126L, and R126C were introduced in GLUT1/pM by PCR performed on template plasmid cDNA using mutagenic oligonucleotides and from which a DNA segment was excised and then replaced by ligation using unique endonuclease sites. All constructs were subjected to restriction analysis and DNA sequencing extending over mutant and ligation areas. Capped runoff cRNA transcripts labeled with [3H]UTP were prepared after plasmid linearization with NotI using an mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), verified by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, quantitated by liquid scintillation counting, and stored in water at -80 °C.Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) ovarian lobes were collected following procedures approved by the Columbia University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Stage V and VI oocytes were dissociated using collagenase and injected with 50 nl of diluted cRNA (0.40 μg/μl for all mutants). This dosage assured that the transport capacity of wild type-expressing oocytes remained below saturation. Control oocytes were injected with 50 nl of water. Cells were maintained in Barth's solution (containing 88 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 10 mm HEPES (178 mosm, pH 7.5)) at 18 °C for 2 days before use.GLUT1 Transport and Expression Assays—Zero-trans influx of 3OMG into oocytes was measured as described previously (25Brockmann K.

For each data point, six to eight oocytes were used; each point was then replicated an additional one to three times except where noted. After incubation for 10 min, the oocytes were washed four times with ice-cold Barth's solution containing 0.2 mm phloretin to block GLUT1 activity. Individual oocytes were then placed into vials, and 0.2 ml of 0.2 n NaOH plus 0.2% SDS were added and mixed. After cellular dissolution, 5 ml of scintillation fluid was placed into each vial for disintegration detection. Zero-trans efflux of 3OMG was performed by injecting different amounts of 14C-labeled 3OMG together with unlabeled 3OMG to reach calculated concentrations of 1–50 mm in oocytes previously expressing wild type and mutant GLUT1 (assuming an average oocyte volume of 0.8 μl). After injection, immediately before the efflux assay, oocytes were rapidly washed three times in 2 ml of Barth's solution and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 0.5 ml of Barth's solution. After 2 min, the oocyte was transferred to another scintillation vial, dissolved, and counted as above. The measured amount of labeled glucose in both vials was used to estimate intracellular glucose concentration for efflux measurements. Basal transport rates from water-injected oocytes were subtracted from transport by oocytes expressing mutant and wild type GLUT1. Water-injected oocyte transport rates typically reached ∼10% of GLUT1-injected oocytes. For R126H protonation experiments, the pH was lowered to 6.5, and methanesulfonic acid (Sigma) replaced HEPES. The results were expressed as pmol of 3OMG uptake/10 min/oocyte. Transport kinetics were analyzed by fitting uptake data to the Michaelis-Menten equation utilizing Origin (OriginLab Software, Inc., Northampton, MA).Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy permitted detection of GLUT1 in frozen oocyte sections as described previously (26Wang D. Pascual J.M. Iserovich P. Yang H. Ma L. Kuang K. Zuniga F.A. Sun R.P. Swaroop K.M. Fischbarg J. De Vivo D.C. J. Biol.

Confocal microscopy was performed at the Optical Microscopy Facility at Columbia University.For protein assay, total cell membranes were prepared as described previously (25Brockmann K. Wang D. Korenke C.G. von Moers A. Ho Y.Y. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. Yang H. Ma L. Kranz-Eble P. Fischbarg J. Hanefeld F. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: after disruption of defolliculated oocytes by pipetting, cells were washed free of yolk. Oocyte ghosts were then suspended in freshly made homogenization buffer (50 μl/oocyte) containing 10 mm HEPES, 83 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.9, and then stroked 25 times in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C three times, saving the supernatant. 15 μl of oocyte purified total membrane samples containing 2 μg of protein were subjected to 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and probed with purified rabbit Glut-101AP primary antibody at 1:5000 dilution and secondary antibody-horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) also at 1:5000 dilution. Under these conditions, GLUT1-expressing oocytes yielded a predominant band of about 55 kDa, corresponding to the monomeric, glycosylated transporter. A smaller, ∼45-kDa band was less abundant and reflected differential glycosylation as the ∼55-kDa fraction was susceptible to enzymatic deglycosylation and conversion to ∼45 kDa (not shown (4Huang Y. Lemieux M.J. Song J. Auer M. Wang D.N. Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar)). Additional ∼90–100-kDa bands and higher mass species were also detectable and possibly represented higher order GLUT1 aggregates.The fractionation procedure for the collection of a plasma membrane-rich fraction followed the method of Finidori-Lepicard et al. (27Finidori-Lepicard J. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hanoune J. Baulieu E.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In brief, because oocytes are large cells (1-mm diameter) densely filled with vacuoles and with a small plasma membrane to total cell material ratio, it is impractical to purify plasma membrane-associated GLUT1. Instead we isolated a cell fraction known to be enriched in plasma membrane protein as estimated by 5′-nucleotidase (a membrane enzyme) activity assay (27Finidori-Lepicard J. Schorderet-Slatkine S. Hanoune J. Baulieu E.E. Nature. 1981; 292: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 28Finidori J. Hanoune J. Baulieu E.E. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1982; 28: 211-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). When using this procedure, the P-1000 cell fraction is known to retain about 75% of the total cellular 5′-nucleotidase activity, and this fraction was used for Western blot analysis of predominantly plasma membrane material using the antibodies and procedures described above. Under these conditions, the molecular species detectable in the immunoblot resembled those identified in the whole-oocyte membrane extract except for a predominance of the monomeric transporter and an additional ∼25-kDa band that may represent a degradation product. GLUT1 signals were quantified digitally using ImageJ software (W. S. Rasband, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The densities of wild type GLUT1 signals in purified oocyte membranes were used to normalize mutant GLUT1 densities.GLUT1 Modeling—A human GLUT1 molecular model was constructed with the homology modeling algorithm Modeler 8v2 (29Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10371) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structures of LacY (Protein Data Bank code 2CFQ) (3Abramson J. Smirnova I. Kasho V.

Science. 2003; 301: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment used in the modeling was based on (a) sequence-structure alignments of the human GLUT1 sequence and the LacY and GlpT structures with FUGUE (30Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar) and (b) a pairwise structural alignment of LacY and GlpT calculated by Structal (31Gerstein M. Levitt M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) excluding the amino and carboxyl termini, which diverge significantly among MFS. The initial sequence alignment was further refined and validated by comparing the accessible residue positions detected in GLUT1 so far by the substituted cysteine accessibility method (32Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) by Mueckler and Makepeace (15Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol.

The long cytoplasmic loop between TM6 and TM7 and the loop between TM1 and TM2 were not modeled.RESULTSDistribution of GLUT1 Mutations—Of 100 GLUT1-deficient patients identified by clinical and analytical criteria, 91 carried a mutation in one SLC2A1 allele. One patient, reported previously (33Wang D. Pascual J.M. Ho Y.Y. Engelstad K. Jhung S. Miller C. Kranz-Eble P. De Vivo D.C. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50 (Abstr.

The remainder eight patients did not exhibit sequence variants associated with abnormal polypeptide encoding or other obvious pathogenic mechanisms and thus may carry undetected mutations in either the promotor region or intron I of SLC2A1 (neither was sequenced) or in another unidentified gene that can also cause GLUT1 deficiency.A total of 21 independent amino acid loci were susceptible to missense mutation (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Several patients shared missense mutations involving one of six individual residues: three patients at Asn-34, three at Gly-91 (reported in Ref. 34Klepper J. Monden I. Guertsen E. Voit T. Willemsen M. Keller K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), three at Arg-93, nine at Arg-126, three at Arg-153, and four at Arg-333. The most frequent substitution was R126H, a heritable mutation (25Brockmann K. Wang D. Korenke C.G. von Moers A. Ho Y.Y. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. Yang H. Ma L. Kranz-Eble P. Fischbarg J. Hanefeld F.

https://openalex.org/W1978056665,"Rab proteins regulate vesicle fusion events during the endocytosis, recycling, and degradation of activated receptor tyrosine kinases. The p85alpha subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase has GTPase-activating protein activity toward Rab5 and Rab4, an activity severely reduced by a single point mutation (p85-R274A). Expression of p85-R274A resulted in increased platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) activation and downstream signaling (Akt and MAPK) and in decreased PDGFR degradation. We now report that the biological consequences of p85-R274A expression cause cellular transformation as determined by the following: aberrant morphological phenotype, loss of contact inhibition, growth in soft agar, and tumor formation in nude mice. Immunohistochemistry shows that the tumors contain activated PDGFR and high levels of activated Akt. Coexpression of a dominant negative Rab5-S34N mutant attenuated these transformed properties. Our results demonstrate that disruption of the RabGAP function of p85alpha due to a single point mutation (R274A) is sufficient to cause cellular transformation via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent mechanism partially reversed by Rab5-S34N expression. This critical new role for p85 in the regulation of Rab function suggests a novel role for p85 in controlling receptor signaling and trafficking through its effects on Rab GTPases."

Two isoforms of human HARE, 315- and 190-kDa, are highly expressed in sinusoidal endothelial cells of liver, lymph node, and spleen; HARE is also in specialized cells in the eye, heart, brain, and kidney. Here we determined whether HA binding to HARE initiates intracellular signaling in Flp-In 293 cells stably expressing either the 315- and 190-kDa HARE or the 190-kDa HARE alone. HARE was co-immunoprecipitated with extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade.

A common feature of the three MAP kinases is that they are typically organized together in three-kinase modules. The usual ERK signaling cascade proceeds through activation of Raf, MEK, and then ERK1/2. MAP kinases are stimulated via receptor and nonreceptor protein kinases and G-protein-coupled receptors. MAP kinase cascades are differentially activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, stress, and ECM components (23Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 24Kyosseva S.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 2004; 59: 201-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). After activation, MAP kinases are translocated to the nucleus where they phosphorylate transcription factors that regulate expression of immediate-early response genes. This cascade of responses results in altered levels of proteins that lead to functional and morphological changes of the cell. HA signaling through CD44 and RHAMM involves several signaling pathways, including the MAP kinase cascade, that lead to HA-dependent functions in various cells and tissues; e.g. HA binding to CD44 may regulate hematopoiesis by activating the p38 MAP kinase (25Khaldoyanidi S. Moll J. Karakhanova S. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Blood. 1999; 94: 940-949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, HA-CD44 interactions affect matrix metabolism in articular chondrocytes via activation of transcription factor NFκB and the p38 MAP kinase (26Hamerman D. Todaro J. Green H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 101: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 27Ohno S. Im H.J. Knudson C.B. Knudson W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17952-17960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CD44 and RHAMM play pivotal roles in activating oncogenic signaling and HA-mediated tumor cell functions. Overexpression of RHAMM strongly correlates with overexpression of Ras and ERK, and could be a useful prognostic marker for breast cancer progression (28Wang C. Thor A.D. Moore D.H. Zhao Y. Kerschmann R. Stern R. Watson P.H. Turley E.A. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 567-576PubMed Google Scholar). CD44 and RHAMM form complexes with ERK1/2 in invasive breast cancer cells with high basal motility (29Hamilton S.R. Fard S.F. Paiwand F.F. Tolg C. Veiseh M. Wang C. McCarthy J.B. Bissell M.J.

An HA-CD44-mediated oncogenic mechanism also occurs in ovarian cancer progression (30Bourguignon L.Y.W. Gilad E. Rothman K. Peyrollier K. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11961-11972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that the receptor HARE was able to mediate HA-dependent intracellular signal transduction and increase the phosphorylation of HARE and ERK1/2. This unexpected cell signaling activity of HARE indicates that this receptor is involved in multiple intracellular routing or signaling pathways.

Cell Lines Expressing 315- or 190-kDa HARE—The construction of 190- and 315-HARE expression vectors, and the selection and characterization of stable Flp-In 293 cell transfectants are described in detail by Harris et al. (16Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 36201-36209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Harris E.N. Kyosseva S.V. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J.

To make the 190-HARE(Δlink) construct, a single primer (5′-CCACTTCCAGGATACCACTGTTCGGATGAAAGATGTGAACTGCACC-3′) was used with the 190-HARE wild type template to delete the coding region of the 93-aa Link domain. Mutagenesis was performed with pfu Ultra (Stratagene) in an EriComp thermal cycler (18 cycles: 94 °C, 30 s; 62 °C, 30 s; and 71 °C, 1 min/plasmid kb). After these reactions, both template and new plasmids were ethanol precipitated (0.1 volume of 3 m potassium acetate, pH 5.5, 2 volumes of 95% ethanol), resuspended in 17 μl of H2O, 2 μl of NEB4 buffer, and 2.5 units of DpnI to digest template plasmids, while retaining the intact mutant plasmids. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, the digestion mixtures were heated to 95 °C for 10 min and immediately transformed into TOP10 supercompetent Escherichia coli cells. Bacterial cells were screened by a Miniprep procedure, PCR, and sequencing to confirm the desired mutation. Plasmids containing correct mutations, open reading frames, and promoter regions were used to make stable cell lines as described (16Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Cells stably expressing recombinant full-length 315-HARE also produce the 190-HARE from the full-length protein by proteolysis. The cloned and amplified open reading frame for the full-length 315-HARE from pooled lymph node cDNAs (Marathon system; Clontech) was inserted into expression vector pcDNA5/RFT/V5-His-TOPO. Except for the secretion signal, the same strategy was used for the 190-HARE. Only stable clones with a single plasmid integrated into the correct, unique recombinase-mediated chromosomal site were selected and used, as described (16Harris E.N. Weigel J.A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol.

Cell Lines and Cell Stimulation—Cells expressing full-length 315-HARE, 190-HARE alone, Flp-In 293 parent cells, or cells transfected with vector alone were grown in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium with 8% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B for at least 2 days prior to experiments, to 80–90% confluence. Cells were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh medium without serum for 1 h at 37°C prior to starting the experiment. Based on preliminary results (not shown) the 1-h incubation in serum-free medium was optimal for observing subsequent HA-induced protein phosphorylation. The cells were washed, received fresh serum-free Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium, and incubated with HA at various concentrations for various times at 37 °C, as indicated. All experiments used non-animal-derived HA with a weight-average molar mass of 580 kDa. For ERK inhibition assays, after the 1-h incubation in serum-free medium, cells were pretreated with different concentrations of the MEK inhibitor PD 98059 for 30 min and then treated with 5 or 10 μg/ml of HA for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then collected by scraping, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged at 1,600 × g for 5 min. Cell pellets were incubated with mixing for 1 h at 4 °C in Lysis Buffer, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cell lysate supernatants were used for experiments after determination of protein content (32Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were subjected to 5 or 10% SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes (34Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (5927) Google Scholar) using a mini-transfer unit (Bio-Rad) for 2 h at 4°Cat 80 V in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 190 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol. To confirm that any differences in band intensity following Western blot analysis were not due to differences in protein loading, the membranes were first stained with 0.1% Ponceau S water-soluble stain and photographed. Membranes were then washed 4 times for 5 min each with water and incubated with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The washed membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with pAbs (diluted 1:1000 in 5% milk/TBST) to pERK1/2, or ERK1/2, or Abs (diluted 1:1000 in TBST containing 5% BSA) to pJNK, JNK, p-p38 MAP kinase, or p38 MAP kinase. After washing 3 times for 10 min each in TBST, the membranes were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP conjugate, diluted 1:2000 in TBST containing either 5% milk (for ERK Abs) or 5% BSA (for JNK and p38 Abs) for 1 h at room temperature. For Western blot analysis using anti-V5 pAb, membranes were incubated in TBST containing 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature, washed, incubated with 1:4000 goat anti-V5 Ab for 1 h, washed, and incubated with secondary anti-goat Ab conjugated to HRP diluted 1:6000. We used 5% BSA-containing buffers for blocking nonspecific binding sites and for incubations with anti-Tyr(P) (PY20) mAb, diluted 1:1000. After four washes for 10 min each in TBST, ECL and exposure to film was utilized for detection according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Autoradiography films were scanned into digital files, and band densities were quantified, using an Alpha Innotech FluoroChem 8000 imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA), as integrated densitometry values (i.e. the sum of all pixel values minus background correction). The results are expressed as a ratio, e.g. pERK divided by tERK. In Figs. 1, 2, and 5, 6, 7, 8, the blots shown in the same panel were successively stripped and stained with different Abs to normalize the results. After one round of detection, blots were stripped by washing with water and incubating in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS at 55 °C for 30 min. After five washings for 10–15 min each with TBST, the blots were reprobed with a different Ab as above. As a control for gel loading accuracy, bound Abs were stripped from the blot and the blot was reprobed with anti-actin Ab. The ECL and film method was utilized for detection. Figures show a representative set of Western blots from two or usually three independent experiments, which gave similar results.FIGURE 1HA induces Tyr phosphorylation of HARE.A, cells expressing 315-HARE, 190-HARE, or EV alone were cultured in T-25 flasks until confluent, washed, scraped, and lysed.

https://openalex.org/W2046615726,"Glycolysis is essential to Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite that causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle. Hexokinase (HK), the first enzyme in glycolysis, catalyzes the phosphorylation of glucose to form glucose 6-phosphate. T. brucei harbors two HKs that are 98% identical at the amino acid level, T. brucei hexokinase 1 (TbHK1) and TbHK2. Recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) has HK activity, whereas rTbHK2 does not. Unlike other eukaryotic HKs, TbHK1 is not subject to inhibition by ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. However, TbHK1 is inhibited by myristate, a critical fatty acid in T. brucei biology. We report here that rTbHKs, similar to authentic TbHK, form oligomers. Myristate dissociated these assemblies when incubated with either ATP or glucose. Furthermore, oligomer disruption was reversible by removal of myristate. Mixing of rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 monomers followed by reassembly yielded enzyme with an ∼3-fold increase in specific activity compared with similarly treated rTbHK1 alone. Surprisingly, reassembly of rTbHK2 with an inactive rTbHK1 variant yielded an active HK, revealing for the first time that rTbHK2 is competent for HK activity. Finally, pyrophosphate inhibits active reassembled rTbHK2 oligomers but not oligomeric rTbHK1, suggesting that the two enzymes have distinct regulatory mechanisms.

Even though energy metabolism varies between life stages, glycolysis appears to be essential to both BSF and PF parasites, as the silencing, mislocalization, or inhibition of glycolytic enzymes is lethal in both stages (1Albert M.A. Haanstra J.R.

Parasitol. 2008; 158: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).Glycolysis in trypanosomes is unique in several ways. Although glycolysis in most eukaryotes is cytoplasmic, a majority of the enzymes required for glycolysis in T. brucei are compartmentalized in a specialized peroxisome called the glycosome. In higher eukaryotes, glycolysis is regulated through allosteric modulation of glycolytic enzymes, including hexokinase (HK), by enzyme products or other metabolic effectors. Interestingly, T. brucei HK does not appear to be regulated in this manner (5Nwagwu M. Opperdoes F.R. Acta Trop. 1982; 39: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar).T. brucei expresses two hexokinases, TbHK1 and TbHK2, that are 98% identical at the amino acid level. Both have been detected in the glycosomes of PF and BSF parasites (6Colasante C. Ellis M. Ruppert T. Voncken F. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 3275-3293Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). It is unclear why T. brucei would need two nearly identical hexokinases, and historically, there has been little discrimination between the two genes and the enzymes they produce.Recombinant TbHK1 (rTbHK1) exhibits HK activity in vitro (7Morris M.T.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Furthermore, RNA interference (RNAi) of TbHK1 leads to a reduction in HK activity in both PF and BSF parasites and is lethal to BSF parasites (4Chambers J.W. Fowler M.L. Morris M.T. Morris J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 158: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the presumption that TbHK1 is the main HK involved in glycolysis (9Morris J.C. Wang Z. Drew M.E. Englund P.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4429-4438Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).However, the function of TbHK2 has remained a mystery. To date, rTbHK2 has lacked detectable HK activity, suggesting that it might have an activity in vivo distinct from catalytically active TbHK1. PF parasites lacking TbHK2 (by knock-out) are morphologically distinct from the parental strain, and they display increased HK activity, an observation that has been attributed to an increase in TbHK1 protein expression found in the TbHK2-deficient cells (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the BSF, the role of TbHK2 is also unclear, although RNAi knockdown of TbHK2 results in the loss of cellular TbHK activity and is lethal, suggesting an important function (1Albert M.A. Haanstra J.R.

Interestingly, TbHK1 activates TbHK2, and the enzymatic activity of the mixed complex, unlike that of TbHK1 alone, is regulated by pyrophosphate (PPi), suggesting a novel role for TbHK2 in the regulation of cell metabolism.MATERIALS AND METHODSTbHK Assays and Myristate Inhibition—rTbHK1, rTbHK2, and TbHK1(S160A) were expressed from pQE30 (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) and protein-purified as described (7Morris M.T.

For assays on cell lysates, 1 × 106 parasites were washed and lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 7.4, on ice and then assayed.Native Gels and In-gel HK Assay—Native gel electrophoresis of rTbHK1 was performed on 4% polyacrylamide gels (4% bisacrylamide, 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.05% (v/v) TEMED, and 0.05% ammonium persulfate) resolved in Tris/glycine buffer (2.7 mm Tris-HCl and 192 mm glycine, pH 6.9). Samples (∼50 ng of protein) were diluted in native gel loading buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol, 2.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), resolved, and silver-stained.For in-gel HK assays, proteins were resolved on 4% native gels, and the gels were washed in ultrapure water (5 min, room temperature) and then incubated in the dark (15 min, room temperature) with 3 units/ml glyceraldehyde-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.02 mg/ml phenazine methosulfate, 0.2 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, and 0.3 mm NADP+ in HK assay buffer (45 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 5 mm glucose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm ATP) (10Tsai H.J. Wilson J.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 206-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Gels were then soaked in 10% acetic acid (15 min, room temperature) to quench the reaction. Glucose 6-phosphate, the product of HK, was visualized by the precipitated formazan on the gel.Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis and Western Blotting of rTbHK1 Native Gels—The molecular masses of the components released from rTbHK1 oligomers following myristate treatment were determined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, where the first dimension was a 4% native gel, and the second was a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The 4% gels were run as described above. Lanes of the 4% native gel were excised, placed on the stacking gel of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and overlaid with 5× SDS-PAGE loading buffer prior to application of current to resolve proteins in the second dimension.For Western blotting, proteins were resolved by native gel and transferred in Tris/glycine buffer to nitrocellulose preequilibrated in the same buffer. Membranes were blocked with 1% nonfat milk in 1× TNT (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 75 mm NaCl, and 0.025% Tween) prior to incubation with mouse anti-RGS-His6 antibody (1:2000, 1 h, room temperature; Qiagen), which was detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature) and chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).Disassembly and Reassembly of rTbHK Oligomers—Recombinant hexokinases (rTbHK1, rTbHK2, and TbHK1(S160A)) were incubated (1 h, room temperature) with fatty acids solubilized in DMSO, including stearate (octadecanoic acid, C18), myristate (C14), and decanoate (C10) in 0.1 m triethanolamine, pH 7.4, supplemented with 5 mm ATP/Mg2+ or 5 mm glucose. Myristate was removed by washing the sample in an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device (3000 molecular weight cutoff, Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) after dilution in wash buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 250 mm imidazole). Seven volumes of wash buffer were passed through the filter. Oligomer disassembly was confirmed by native gel electrophoresis, and the concentration of recovered protein was determined using a Pierce BCA kit. Recovery was confirmed by a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel. To reassemble oligomers, myristate-treated monomeric rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 were mixed prior to washing on the Amicon filtration unit.RESULTSMyristate and Lonidamine (LND) Inhibit TbHK from Parasite Lysate, but Only Myristate Disrupts Oligomerization—Little is known concerning the regulation of T. brucei HK in vivo. Unlike many HKs, TbHK is not inhibited by glucose 6-phosphate or ADP (5Nwagwu M. Opperdoes F.R. Acta Trop. 1982; 39: 61-72PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate potential regulators, we explored rTbHK1 inhibition with a spectrum of metabolites, including amino acids (alanine, proline, glutamine, leucine, and threonine), carbohydrates (galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and inositol), phospholipids (phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidic acid), small molecules (lactate, malate, succinate, butyrate, glycerol, glycerol 3-phosphate, and acetyl-CoA), and glycolytic intermediates (fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, pyruvate, and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)) as potential TbHK1 inhibitors. None of these impacted rTbHK1 activity at a 10 mm final concentration under our standard assay conditions.Previously, we found that medium to long chain (C10–18) free fatty acids inhibited rTbHK1, with myristate being the most potent (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Authentic TbHK from BSF 90-13 lysate is also sensitive to myristate, being completely inhibited by 1 mm free fatty acid in an in vitro assay (Fig. 1A). Likewise, LND, another potent inhibitor of rTbHK1, inhibited authentic HK activity from BSF lysates (4Chambers J.W. Fowler M.L. Morris M.T. Morris J.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 158: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).TbHK activity has been previously isolated as an ∼300-kDa hexameric protein complex containing an unknown mixture of TbHK1 and TbHK2 from BSF parasites (11Misset O. Bos O.J. Opperdoes F.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because HK activity can be recovered after electrophoresis (due to loss of inhibitor during processing), we were able to examine the effect of inhibitor on the oligomeric state using an in-gel HK assay. Lysates were resolved on 4% native gels, and HK in-gel assays were performed. Untreated parasites yielded HK activity that migrated on the native gel as an oligomeric complex consistent with a hexamer with an apparent molecular mass of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Interestingly, lysates treated with myristate lacked detectable activity at the ∼300-kDa position but instead had HK activity at ∼50 kDa, consistent with migration of the monomer of the enzyme. LND-treated cell lysate yielded HK activity corresponding to an ∼300-kDa species, suggesting that LND does not disrupt the complex. Of note, in assays performed on lysates in solution, both myristate and LND were potent TbHK1 inhibitors.rTbHK Forms Oligomers—Oligomerization is not limited to authentic TbHK, as native gel analysis of purified rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 revealed that the proteins behave as oligomeric complexes, consistent with an apparent mass of ∼300 kDa (Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 11). The apparent mass of the complex was confirmed by gel filtration chromatography, with TbHK2 eluting between β-amylase (200 kDa) and apoferritin (440 kDa) (data not shown). These high molecular mass complexes were not the result of covalent linkage of subunits, as oligomers were disrupted by treatment with 0.1% SDS (data not shown).FIGURE 2rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 formoligomers.A, native gel(4% acrylamide) analysis of rTbHK1 (50 ng; lane1) after treatment (30 min, room temperature) with DMSO (lane 2), myristate (500 μm; lanes 3–5), or LND (10 mm; lanes 8–10) in the presence of 5 mm ATP/Mg2+ (lanes 3 and 8), 5 mm glucose (lanes 4 and 9), or no substrate (lanes 5 and 10) is shown. Additionally, untreated rTbHK1 (lane 6), untreated rTbHK2 (lane 11), DMSO treated rTbHK1 (lane 7), and rTbHK2 treated with ATP and myristate (lane 12) are included. Samples were then resolved and silver-stained. B, treatment of rTbHK1 oligomers with increasing salt can disrupt the complex. rTbHK1 (50 ng) was incubated with increasing NaCl(upper panels), KCl(middle panels), or MgCl2 (lower panels), and the impact was assessed by native gel (upper gel) or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (lower gel). Salt concentrations were 250 mm, 500 mm, 1 m, and 2.5 m. Aberrant migration (upon SDS-PAGE) was likely due to the high salt concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Interestingly, incubation of purified rTbHK1 with myristate (500 μm) in the presence of either ATP or glucose led to a disruption of the complex (Fig. 2A, lanes 3 and 4), whereas incubation with a longer fatty acid, stearate, or a shorter fatty acid, decanoate (neither of which appreciably inhibited TbHK1 activity) (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), under similar conditions had little impact on the oligomers (data not shown). Incubation with fatty acid alone (in the absence of either glucose or ATP) or with vehicle (DMSO) did not impact oligomerization (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). rTbHK2 oligomers were also disrupted by myristate in the presence of ATP (Fig. 2A, lane 12).Similar studies were carried out with LND, another potent rTbHK1 inhibitor. Incubation of rTbHK1 with LND in the presence or absence of ATP/Mg2+ or glucose had no impact on the ∼300-kDa complex compared with untreated rTbHK1 (Fig. 2A, lanes 6–10). This result is similar to that observed when LND was used to inhibit endogenous TbHK followed by in-gel HK assays (Fig. 1B, lane 3).Incubation of recombinant oligomers with different salts had distinct impacts on the complexes. Incubation with NaCl and KCl (from 250 mm to 2.5 m) had minimal impact on oligomers (Fig. 2B). Similar treatment with the divalent salt MgCl2, which is also required for activity, disrupted oligomers at higher concentrations. To control for possible loss of protein in sample handling, proteins were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which revealed minimal loss of protein during either treatment (Fig. 2B).Disassembly Yields HK Monomers—To further resolve the impact of myristate destabilization on rTbHK oligomers, samples were analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with native gel electrophoresis in the first dimension and SDS-PAGE in the second. This revealed that untreated rTbHK1 migrates as an ∼300-kDa complex that resolves into an ∼50-kDa species in the second denaturing dimension (indicated by * in Fig. 3A). However, incubation of rTbHK1 with myristate (1 mm) led to a decrease in the ∼50-kDa species arising from the ∼300-kDa complex (80% by densitometer) with a corresponding increase in a species migrating in the first dimension at the dye front that is ∼50 kDa in the SDS-PAGE dimension (indicated by [caret] in Fig. 3A). Western blotting of the 4% native gel with an antibody to the N-terminal epitope tag revealed an increase in the abundance of the monomeric (∼50 kDa) protein in response to increasing myristate (Fig. 3B). A corresponding decrease in the ∼300-kDa species in the native gel was noted by silver stain, but the oligomer was not transferred efficiently enough for Western blotting purposes.FIGURE 3Oligomers disassemble into monomers.A, two-dimensional electrophoresis of untreated (left panel) or myristate (1 mm)-treated (right panel) rTbHK1 oligomers. Proteins were resolved on 4% native gels that were then inserted into the stacking gel of a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins from the oligomer (*) or the monomer ([caret]) are indicated. The gels shown are representative of three experiments from two purifications of rTbHK1. B, Western blotting of rTbHK1 oligomers treated with increasing myristate (0–750 μm) resolved by 4% native gel. Following transfer, the blot was incubated with a primary mouse monoclonal antibody (1:2000) against the RGS-His6 epitope tag used in the purification. Following incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000), the membrane was developed using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Disassembly Is Reversible—To determine whether the disassembly of rTbHK oligomers is reversible, we incubated rTbHK1 or rTbHK2 with myristate in the presence of ATP/Mg2+ and then washed the myristate out of the samples by centrifugal filtration (see the scheme in Fig. 4A). Oligomers were treated with myristate (or DMSO carrier) and analyzed by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 4B) or by SDS-PAGE to confirm equal loading (lower panels in all sections of Fig. 4B). rTbHKs treated with myristate were disassembled (Fig. 4B, upper center panel) compared with samples treated with DMSO (Fig. 4B, lower center panel). As anticipated, myristate treatment also inhibited rTbHK1 by >95% (data not shown).FIGURE 4TbHK oligomer reassembly reveals that TbHK2 is an active hexokinase.A, schematic illustrating the disassembly and reassembly of oligomeric rTbHKs. B, native gel (4%) and SDS-PAGE analysis of TbHKs prior to incubation (left panels) with or without DMSO or myristate. Samples were then analyzed to assess dissociation (middle panels) and again after centrifugal filtration (right panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Samples were then subjected to centrifugal filtration, washed exhaustively to remove myristate, and then subjected to electrophoresis on native gels to examine reassembly. Both rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 yielded reassembled ∼300-kDa complexes after myristate disruption and centrifugal filtration. These oligomers were similar to complexes found in untreated samples (Fig. 4B, right panels).Oligomer Reassembly Alters Enzymatic Activity of the Complex—Following centrifugal filtration to remove myristate, rTbHK1 reassembled into oligomers with specific activity similar to untreated or DMSO-treated rTbHK1 samples (Fig. 5B, left panel). Furthermore, the reassembled rTbHK1 had Km values for glucose and ATP of 0.05 ± 0.003 and 0.25 ± 0.005 mm, respectively, similar to untreated rTbHK1 (0.06 mm 0.28 mm) (8Chambers J.W. Morris M.T. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 420-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). On the other hand, reassembled rTbHK2 remained inactive, as was found in the untreated sample (Fig. 5B, left panel).FIGURE 5Reassembly of mixed oligomers reveals that TbHK2 has HK activity.A, schematic representation for assembly of mixed complexes. B, hexokinase activity of untreated, DMSO-treated, or myristate-dissociated and reassembled rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 (left panel) and rTbHK1(S160A) (right panel). Equal amounts (250 ng) of rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 were used throughout. Please note that the differences in HK activities of DMSO-treated rTbHK1 in the left and right panels were due to differences in the specific activity of proteins used.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mixing rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 homohexamers without first disrupting the complexes had no impact on HK activity (Fig. 5B, left panel) (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, mixing equal amounts of myristate-treated (disassembled) rTbHK1 and rTbHK2 (Fig. 5A) prior to centrifugal filtration yielded an ∼3-fold increase in enzymatic activity compared with the controls (Fig. 5B, left panel). The heteromeric oligomer had similar affinity for glucose compared with rTbHK1, with Km = 0.035 ± 0.003 mm, whereas affinity for ATP was increased slightly, with Km = 0.12 ± 0.01 mm. Disassembly and reassembly were confirmed as before using native gel electrophoresis (data not shown).TbHK2 Assembled with a Catalytically Inactive Mutant, TbHK1(S160A), Has HK Activity—To determine whether the increase in mixed oligomer activity was due to a change in the specific activity of rTbHK1 or the result of some “activation” of rTbHK2 (which heretofore was inactive), rTbHK2 was reassembled with an inactive rTbHK1 variant, rTbHK1(S160A), which lacks phosphotransferase activity (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). First, the impact of centrifugal filtration and reassembly was assessed for rTbHK1(S160A). This variant lacked detectable HK activity, similar to rTbHK2 reassembled as a homohexamer (Fig. 5B, right panel). Interestingly, mixing rTbHK2 and rTbHK1(S160A) (to yield the rTbHK2-rTbHK1(S160A) complex) resulted in detectable HK activity (Fig. 5B, right panel) that had similar kinetic properties compared with rTbHK1, with Km values for glucose and ATP of 0.45 ± 0.006 and 0.19 ± 0.018 mm, respectively, similar to those found for rTbHK1 (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mixing myristate-treated rTbHK1(S160A) with disassembled rTbHK1 had little impact on activity.TbHK2 Is Inhibited by Pyrophosphate—Risedronate, a bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate, inhibits Trypanosoma cruzi HK (12Hudock M.P.

Parasitol. 2008; 158: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the HK activity resulting from the rTbHK2-rTbHK1(S160A) complex was slightly sensitive to 5 mm risedronate (Fig. 6A), a concentration that had no impact on rTbHK1 in complex with rTbHK1(S160A) (Fig. 6A). PPi itself was an even more potent inhibitor of the rTbHK2-rTbHK1 (S160A) complex (70% inhibition at 5 mm). Like risedronate, PPi had a negligible effect on TbHK1 complexed with rTbHK1(S160A) (Fig. 6A).FIGURE 6Pyrophosphate inhibits rTbHK2.A, reassembled rTbHK2-rTbHK1(S160A) complex or rTbHK1-rTbHK1(S160A) complex was incubated with risedronate (RSDN; 5 mm) or PPi (5 mm) prior to assaying for HK activity. B, complexes generated with a higher percentage of rTbHK2 have increased sensitivity to PPi. Proteins were reassembled with increasing molar amounts of rTbHK2 (while total protein was kept constant at 500 ng/assay) and then assayed for HK activity in the presence or absence of PPi (5 mm). Reassembly yielded TbHK1/TbHK2 ratios of 6:0, 5:1, 4:2, 3:3, 2:4, and 1:5, with untreated samples having ratios of 1.9, 3.1, 5.3, 6.4, 2.4, and 1.3 mmol/min HK activity, respectively. Results are plotted as the percent of this untreated activity remaining after PPi inhibition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Altering the ratio of active rTbHK1 monomer to inactive rTbHK2 monomer (both generated by myristate disruption of homohexamers) prior to reassembly altered the sensitivity of the mixed complexes to PPi (Fig. 6B). As more rTbHK2 was included in the complexes, the HK activity became more sensitive to PPi inhibition relative to untreated control complexes, suggesting that rTbHK2 is an important determinant in PPi sensitivity.Cellular HK Pyrophosphate Sensitivity Is Influenced by Parasite Carbon Source—The PPi sensitivity of the rTbHK2-rTbHK1(S160A) complex (Fig. 6A) and the observation that complexes containing a higher rTbHK2 percentage (Fig. 6B) were more sensitive to PPi suggested that this inhibitor could be used as a probe to determine the relative composition of TbHK complexes from T. brucei. To date, the lack of sensitive TbHK1 and TbHK2 antibodies has made it extremely challenging to investigate relative amounts of the nearly identical polypeptides. BSF 90-13 and TbHK2–/– PF 29-13 cells (which lack TbHK2) (7Morris M.T. DeBruin C. Yang Z. Chambers J.W. Smith K.S. Morris J.C. Eukaryot. Cell. 2006; 5: 2014-2023Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) had HKs with similar sensitivity to PPi, suggesting that the BSF may rely more on TbHK1 for cellular HK activity (Fig. 7A). However, parental PF 29-13 cells had HK activity that was composed of a higher percentage of PPi-sensitive HK, suggesting that TbHK2 plays a more important role in the metabolism of the PF parasite. The PF 29-13 HK activity was dynamic, with growth under different nutrient conditions leading to HK activity with differing PPi sensitivity (Fig. 7B). Parasites grown in medium with very littl"

NhaA consists of 12 TMSs 2The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; CL-NhaA, cysteineless NhaA; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BMH, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane; MTS-2-MTS, 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; MTSES, 2-sulfonatoethylmethanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt; o-PDM, N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide; p-PDM, N,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; L255C, NhaA Leu255 replaced with Cys (all other nhaA mutations are accordingly depicted). 2The abbreviations used are: TMS, transmembrane segment; CL-NhaA, cysteineless NhaA; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BMH, 1,6-bismaleimidohexane; MTS-2-MTS, 1,2-ethanediyl bismethanethiosulfonate; MTSES, 2-sulfonatoethylmethanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt; o-PDM, N,N′-o-phenylenedimaleimide; p-PDM, N,N′-p-phenylenedimaleimide; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; L255C, NhaA Leu255 replaced with Cys (all other nhaA mutations are accordingly depicted). with the N and C termini pointing into the cytoplasm. It represents a novel fold; TMSs IV and XI are each comprised of two short helices connected by extended chains that cross each other, in close contact, in the middle of the membrane (TMS IV/XI assembly (11Hunte C. Screpanti M. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 534: 1197-1202Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and Fig. 1). This creates a delicately balanced electrostatic environment in the middle of the membrane. An ion funnel opens to the cytoplasm with a negatively charged orifice that is most suitable to act as a cation trap and a “pH sensor.” The funnel (designated cytoplasmic) ends in the middle of the membrane in the vicinity of the putative ion binding site and the crossing of the TMS IV/XI assembly. Together these structural elements have been suggested to play a crucial role in the pH-controlled Na+/H+ exchange mechanism (11Hunte C. Screpanti M. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 534: 1197-1202Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Based on the NhaA crystal structure obtained at pH 4, very crucial functional and structural roles have also been assigned to TMS IX and the neighboring part of loop VIII–IX in the mechanism and pH regulation of NhaA. It contains amino acid residues that may (a) participate in the pH sensor at the orifice of the cytoplasmic funnel, (b) connect TMS IX to TMS XI of the TMS IV/XI assembly, (c) line the cytoplasmic cation funnel leading to the active site, and (d) line the NhaA dimer interface. The three-dimensional structure of NhaA monomer agrees with the electron density map obtained by cryoelectron microscopy of the two-dimensional crystal, implying that it represents a native conformation in the membrane (12Screpanti E. Padan E. Rimon A. Michel H. Hunte C. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 192-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, because both the two-dimensional and three-dimensional crystals were obtained at pH 4, at which NhaA is down-regulated, the structure of the active conformation(s) and the process(s) leading to it have remained open questions. Hence it is crucial to conduct experiments, both structurally and functionally oriented, at physiological pH at which NhaA is active to obtain a working model for the mechanism of activity and pH regulation of the antiporter at physiological pH. The present study examined the roles of TMS IX and the neighboring part of loop VIII–IX at physiological pH when NhaA is active. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions—EP432 is an E. coli K-12 derivative, which is melBLid, ΔnhaA1::kan, ΔnhaB1::cat, ΔlacZY, thr1 (13Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TA16 is nhaA+nhaB+lacIQ (TA15lacIQ) and otherwise isogenic to EP432 (4Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in modified L broth (LBK, L broth in which Na+ is replaced by K+) (14Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in minimal medium A without sodium citrate (15Davis B.D. Mingioli E.S. J. Bacteriol. 1950; 60: 17-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 0.5% glycerol, 0.01% MgS04·7H2O, and 2.5 μg/ml thiamine. Antibiotic was 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The resistance to Na+ was tested in Na+ selective medium: LB containing 0.6 m NaCl buffered with 60 mm 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol; pH was adjusted with HCl to pH 7 or pH 8.3. For plates, 1.5% agar was used. Plasmids—All plasmids used have pBR322 origin of replication and carry bla (AmpR). pCL-BSTX, a pCL-GMAR100 derivative (16Tzubery T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3265-3272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) encodes Cys-less NhaA with a silent BstX site at codon 248 in nhaA. pCL-AXH3, a derivative of pCL-AXH2, contains a BstXI silent site at codon 248 in nhaA (17Kozachkov L. Herz K. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2419-2430Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It expresses cysteineless NhaA (CL-NhaA) from the tac promoter fused at its C terminus to two factor Xa cleavage sites followed by a His6 tag. pCL-HAH4 is a derivative of pCL-HAH3 (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), bearing the silent BstXI mutation at codon 248 in nhaA. It expresses from the tac promoter a variant of CL-NhaA of which segment Arg383–Val388 was replaced by a hemagglutinin epitope followed by two factor Xa cleavage sites and a His6 tag. All plasmids carrying mutations are designated by the name of the plasmid followed by the mutation. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was conducted following a polymerase chain reaction-based protocol (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6810) Google Scholar) or site-directed mutagenesis facilitated by DpnI selection on hemimethylated DNA (20Fisher C.L. Pei G.K. BioTechniques. 1997; 23 (574): 570-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). For Cys replacement of Lys242, His243, Gly244, Arg245, Ser246, Pro247, Ala248, Lys249, Arg250, Leu251, His253, Leu255, Trp258, and Leu262, pCL-HAH4 was used as a template. For Cys replacement of His256, Pro257, and Val259 pCL-AXH3 was used as template. For Cys replacement of Leu264, Phe267, Phe344, and Phe267/Phe344 pCL-AXH3 and pCL-BstX were used as templates. All mutations were verified by DNA sequencing of the entire gene through the ligation junctions with the vector plasmid. Isolation of Membrane Vesicles and Assay of Na+/H+ Antiporter Activity—EP432 cells transformed with the respective plasmids were grown in LBK medium, and everted membrane vesicles were prepared and used to determine the Na+/H+ antiporter activity as described previously (21Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Goldberg E.B. Arbel T. Chen J. Karpel R. Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The assay of antiport activity was based upon the measurement of Na+-induced changes in the ΔpH as measured by acridine orange, a fluorescent probe of ΔpH. The fluorescence assay was performed with 2.5 ml of reaction mixture containing 50–100 μg of membrane protein, 0.5 μm acridine orange, 150 mm KCl, 50 mm 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane, and 5 mm MgCl2, and the pH was titrated with HCl as indicated. After energization with either ATP or d-lactate (2 mm, pH 7 titrated by KOH), quenching of the fluorescence was allowed to achieve a steady state, and then Na+ was added. A reversal of the fluorescence level (dequenching) indicates that protons are exiting the vesicles in antiport with Na+. As shown previously, the end level of dequenching is a good estimate of the antiporter activity (23Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and the concentration of the ion that gives half-maximal dequenching is a good estimate of the apparent Km for Na+ (or Li+) of the antiporter (23Schuldiner S. Fishkes H. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 706-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 24Tsuboi Y. Inoue H. Nakamura N. Kanazawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21467-21473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concentration range of the cations tested was 0.01–100 mm at the indicated pH values, and the apparent Km values were calculated by linear regression of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. High pressure membranes were isolated as described previously (25Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Protein Purification—For extraction of NhaA, membranes (0.5 mg of membrane protein) were resuspended in 1.15 ml of a solution containing 4.3 mm Tris/Cl (pH 7.5), 110 mm sucrose, and 60 mm choline chloride supplemented with 20% glycerol, 1% β-dodecyl maltoside, and 0.1 m MOPS (pH 7). The suspension was incubated for 20 min at 4 °C and centrifuged (Beckman TLA 100.4; 265,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). For affinity purification of NhaA, the supernatant was added to 50 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. Then beads were washed in binding and washing buffers (26Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted in 200 μl of acid elution buffer (27Rimon A. Tzubery T. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26810-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C in 20 μl of SDS-PAGE sampling buffer supplemented with 300 mm imidazole and centrifuged (Eppendorf; 20,800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C). Protein Determination—The protein was determined according to Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214435) Google Scholar). Detection and Quantification of NhaA and Its Mutated Proteins in the Membrane—NhaA and its mutated derivatives in membranes were quantitated in membranes by Western analysis as described previously (29Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) using the NhaA-specific monoclonal antibody 1F6 (30Padan E. Venturi M. Michel H. Hunte C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) or by resolving the affinity-purified proteins by SDS-PAGE, staining with Coomassie Blue, and quantification of the band density by Image Gauge (Fuji) software (6Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Accessibility of Cys Replacements of CL-NhaA to Impermeant Sulfhydryl Reagent MTSET—The accessibility assay in intact cells was performed as described previously (31Ninio S. Elbaz Y. Schuldiner S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 562: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), but the Tris buffer was replaced with 100 mm potassium phosphate and 5 mm MgSO4 (pH 7.5 or 8.5). For assay of accessibility to MTSET from the cytoplasmic side, everted membrane vesicles (500 μg of membrane protein) were incubated with 10 mm MTSET in the phosphate buffer (at pH 7.5 or 8.5) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 45 min. Then the reaction was stopped by dilution into 3 ml of TSC buffer (containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mm sucrose, and 140 mm choline chloride) and centrifuged (Beckman TLA 100.4; 265,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The protein was extracted, affinity-purified on Ni+2-NTA, and left on the beads. The beads were washed twice in binding buffer (26Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) at pH 7.4, resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.2 mm fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes), and further incubated for 30 min at 25 °C to determine the Cys left free following MTSET treatment. Then the beads were washed, and the protein was eluted in a sample buffer containing 300 mm imidazole and separated by SDS-PAGE. For evaluation of the fluorescence intensity, the gels were photographed under UV light (260 nm) as described previously (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For quantifying the amount of the protein, the gels were Coomassie Blue-stained, and the density of the bands was determined. After normalization of the fluorescence intensity to the amount of protein in the band, the accessibility to MTSET was determined from the difference in the fluorescence of the reagent-treated and untreated samples (100% fluorescence = 0% modification by MTSET (18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)). In Situ Site-directed Intermolecular Cross-linking—Site-directed intermolecular cross-linking was conducted in situ on high pressure membrane vesicles isolated from TA16 cells overexpressing the various NhaA mutants (25Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Membranes (500 μg of membrane protein) were resuspended in a buffer (0.5 ml) containing 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5 or 8.5), 5 mm MgSO4, and one of the freshly prepared homobifunctional cross-linkers: 2 mm BMH (Pierce), 1 mm o-PDM (Sigma), 1 mm p-PDM (Sigma), 2 mm MTS-2-MTS (Toronto Research Chemicals), or a 4 mm concentration of the oxidizing reagent diamide (Sigma). The stock solutions of the cross-linkers were prepared in N,N-dimethylformamide so that the amount of N,N-dimethylformamide in the reaction mixture did not exceed 1%, a concentration that does not affect the antiporter activity. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature with gentle rotation for 45 min, and the reaction was terminated by 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the case of maleimides (BMH, o-PDM, and p-PDM) or by dilution in TSC buffer (in the case of MTS-2-MTS and diamide). Then the affinity-purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (non-reducing conditions in the case of treatment with MTS-2-MTS and diamide) and Coomassie Blue-stained to determine the densities of the bands with mobility corresponding to that of NhaA monomers and dimers (6Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18Rimon A. Tzubery T. Galili L. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14897-14905Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The sum of the densities of the monomers and dimers equals 100%. Measurement of accessibility to the cross-linking reagents was performed on the proteins bound to the beads as described above for MTSET. Treatment of Membranes Expressing Cys Replacement Mutations with SH Reagents for Activity Assay—Membranes (0.5 mg of membrane protein) were resuspended in a reaction mixture as described above for cross-linking but containing one of the following reagents: 1 mm NEM, 1 mm MTSES (Anatrace), 1 mm MTSET (Anatrace), 1 mm AMS (Molecular Probes), or a 4 mm concentration of the oxidizing reagent diamide. The reaction mixture was incubated with gentle shaking for 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 3 ml of TSC buffer (containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol in the case of maleimide reagents) and centrifugation (Beckman TLA 100.4; 265,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The membranes were resuspended in TSC buffer (5–10 mg of membrane protein/ml), and the Na+/H+ antiporter activity was monitored as described above. For determination of accessibility to the SH reagents, the protein was affinity-purified, and free Cys residues were determined by fluorescein-5-maleimide labeling as described above for MTSET. Reconstitution of NhaA into Proteoliposomes and Measurement of ΔpH-driven 22Na Uptake—NhaA proteoliposomes were reconstituted and ΔpH-driven 22Na uptake was determined as described previously (4Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Kariv Z. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26470-26476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least twice with practically identical results. Cys Replacement Mutations, Expression in the Membrane, and Growth Phenotypes at Physiological pH—The crystal structure of the acid pH-locked conformation of NhaA (11Hunte C. Screpanti M. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 534: 1197-1202Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar) and structure-based computation (33Olkhova E. Hunte C. Screpanti E. Padan E. Michel H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) combined with genetic and biochemical data (16Tzubery T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3265-3272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) have suggested that the cytoplasmic end of helix IX and the in-tandem part of loop VIII–IX contain amino acid residues involved in the pH sensor of NhaA. To identify these residues, we systematically replaced with Cys the amino acids residues (each separately) in segment Glu241–Val259 of NhaA excluding E241C, V254C (6Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Venturi M. Padan E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3403-3412Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Gerchman Y. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24617-24624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and E252C (16Tzubery T. Rimon A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3265-3272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) that were isolated previously (Fig. 1). In addition, Leu262, Leu264, and Phe267 were replaced with Cys (Fig. 1). The latter two amino acids have been shown by the crystal structure to be close enough to interact with TMS XI residues and therefore, even with no experimental support, have been assigned a structural and/or functional role in the translocation machinery (Ref. 11Hunte C. Screpanti M. Venturi M. Rimon A. Padan E. Michel H. Nature. 2005; 534: 1197-1202Crossref Scopus (521) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). All mutants were constructed in CL-NhaA, a variant that is as expressed and active as the native NhaA (26Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The mutations were subjected to structural and functional studies at the physiological pH (pH 6.5–8.5) to reveal the physiological role of the replaced residues when NhaA is progressively activated with increasing pH (1Padan E. Bibi E. Masahiro I. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 4Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Challenging the results obtained at the physiological pH with the predictions based on the acid pH-locked crystal structure also allowed us to deduce whether pH-induced conformational changes occurred during the activation process. To characterize the mutations with respect to growth, expression, and antiporter activity, the mutated plasmids were transformed into EP432, an E. coli strain that lacks the two Na+-specific antiporters (NhaA and NhaB (13Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). This strain neither grows on selective media (0.6 m NaCl at pH 7 or 8.3) nor exhibits any Na+/H+ antiporter activity in isolated everted membrane vesicles unless transformed with a plasmid encoding an active antiporter (for a review, see Ref. 1Padan E. Bibi E. Masahiro I. Krulwich T.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1717: 67-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar; see also Table 1). As compared with the level of expression of the wild type (100%), all mutants were expressed at roughly 40% of wild type level (Table 1) from the multicopy plasmids. The mutant proteins, affinity-purified on a Ni+2-NTA column, were readily detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Notably this expression level is far above that obtained from a single chromosomal gene that confers a wild type phenotype (29Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas most of the single mutants conferred upon EP432 Na+ resistance similar to that of the wild type (Table 1), a few mutants grew somewhat less efficiently on the selective media as was evident by smaller colony number and colony size at either pH (K242C) or only at alkaline pH (R250C and H253C). Most interestingly, mutant F267C grew very similarly to the wild type at neutral pH but did not grow at all at alkaline pH (Table 1).TABLE 1Cys replacements of residues in loop VIII–IX, TMS IX, and TMS XI of NhaA For characterization of the mutations, EP432 cells were transformed with the plasmids carrying the indicated mutations. The expression level was expressed as a percentage of the control cells (EP432/pCl-HAH4) encoding CL-NhaA.

The small Tims escort hydrophobic proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane across the intermembrane space (IMS). 4The abbreviations used are: IMS, intermembrane space; WT, wild-type; PC, phosphatidylcholine; CL, cardiolipin; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; SC, synthetic complete; BN, blue native. Key to their function is their organization in heterooligomeric complexes. Upon entering the outer membrane channel, the small Tims are recognized in the IMS by Mia40 (1Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S.

Site-specific oxidation of their cysteines into intramolecular disulfides releases them in an assembly-competent folded state that allows formation of specific Tim complexes (2Mesecke N. Terziyska N.

Cell. 2008; 19: 226-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Tim12 stands out as the only small Tim exclusively located on the inner membrane (8Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It functions after recognition of the substrate by the soluble small Tim complexes (8Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 9Sirrenberg C. Endres M. Folsch H. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1998; 391: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and it associates with both the Tim9-Tim10 complex and Tim22 in the membrane (10Adam A. Endres M. Sirrenberg C. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of its interactions is still unknown. Here, we show that Tim12 has an intrinsic affinity for inner mitochondrial membrane lipids, which are enriched in cardiolipin. Deletion analysis, in vivo complementation assays, and import assays followed by analysis of native Tim complexes revealed distinct functional domains in Tim12: the N-terminal segment contains necessary import information but is dispensable for function, whereas the C-terminal end is essential in vivo, has a determining role in lipid binding and association with Tim9, and affects the assembly of Tim12 in complexes with other Tims. We show that Tim12 directly binds to transmembrane segments of its substrates, primarily via its N-terminal domain. As this “substrate sensor” domain of Tim12 overlaps in substrate binding with that of Tim10 and is dispensable, whereas on the other hand the Tim12 C-terminal “assembly domain” is essential, we propose that the key feature of Tim12 function relies on its role as a linker subunit between the soluble and membrane-embedded translocase complexes. In Vitro Transcription/Translation pSP64 Vector—Wild-type TIM12 was PCR-amplified with Tim12 (forward BamHI) and Tim12 (reverse EcoRI) primers from a yeast genomic DNA and cloned into pSP64 with BamHI-EcoRI. The deletion mutants were then PCR-amplified as BamHI-EcoRI fragments and cloned into pSP64. Bacterial Expression pET28 and pRSET Vectors—Wild-type TIM12 was PCR-amplified from a yeast genomic DNA and cloned as an NdeI-EcoRI fragment. The deletion mutants were extracted from pSP64 and cloned into pET28 (ΔN17 and ΔC18) or pRSETa (ΔN28 and ΔC39) by restriction digestion with BamHI-EcoRI. The extra sequence between the His tag and the ATG site in pET28 was extracted by digestion with NdeI-BamHI, and the 5′-overhangs were filled with Klenow and religated. Yeast Vector pRS316 for in Vivo Complementation of Tim12 Variants—The Tim12 flanking regions were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA using Tim12/Prom-5′ (forward) and Tim12/Prom-3′B (reverse) for the promoter (593 bp) and Tim12/Term-5′ (forward) and Tim12/Term-3′ (reverse) for the terminator (300 bp). The fragments obtained were subcloned into pGEMTeasy (Promega) or pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The promoter was isolated by digestion with HindIII-BamHI and cloned in front of the TIM12 open reading frame in pSP64/TIM12. The HindIII-EcoRI cassette was then subcloned into pRS316 to give the pRS316/5′B/TIM12 vector. The terminator was then cut with EcoRI-XbaI and cloned at the 3′-end of the open reading frame. This vector, pRS316/5′B/TIM12/3′, was then used to subclone the deletion mutants by replacing the TIM12 open reading frame with BamHI-EcoRI. The primers used for the cloning procedures are shown in supplemental Table 2. Recombinant proteins were expressed in the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain from pET28a, pRSETa, or pGEX4T-1 constructs (see supplemental Table 1). Purification of His6-tagged or glutathione S-transferase-tagged fusion proteins was performed according to published methods (12Baud C. de Marcos Lousa C. Tokatlidis K. Protein Pept.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36100-36108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). GAL-TIM12 Strain Generation—The cassette containing the KANMX selection marker followed by the GAL1-10 promoter was extracted from M4801 by ScaI-BamHI digestion and inserted into the pSP64TIM12prom/Tim12 plasmid, giving rise to the pSP64Tim12prom/KANMX4/GAL1-10/TIM12 plasmid. The whole cassette was amplified using the TIM12 promoter forward and Tim12 reverse primers. The PCR product was then used to transform the FT5 yeast strain (14Tzamarias D. Struhl K. Nature. 1994; 369: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and selected on YPGal medium for 2 days. The cells were replicated on YPGal supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml Geneticin (Sigma). To confirm the genotype of the colonies, genomic DNA was extracted, and the correct orientation was checked by PCR using Tim12 reverse EcoRI and KANMX4 reverse primers. Depletion of Tim12 from the GAL-TIM12 strain was confirmed by growth arrest in glucose-containing medium and by Western blotting of mitochondria purified from the GAL-TIM12 strain. Complementation Experiments—For the complementation experiments, the GAL-TIM12 strain was transformed with the pRS316 plasmid carrying the corresponding genes (different mutants of Tim12 or the fusion cytochrome b2-(1–85)/ΔN28Tim12) under the control of the endogenous TIM12 promoter (5′: 593 bp upstream of TIM12) and terminator (3′: 300 bp downstream of TIM12). The transformed clones were grown overnight at 30 °C in minimal medium SC galactose-Ura and then either shifted to SC glucose-Ura for 36 h at 30 °C or reinoculated in SC galactose-Ura. Serial 1/10 dilutions of each culture were made, and 5 μl were dropped on either SC glucose-Ura or SC galactose-Ura. Plates were then incubated at 30 °C for 2 days. Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cardiolipin (CL) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. 12 mg of lipids (PC or PC/CL at a 5/1 ratio) in chloroform were dried with nitrogen for 30 min; resuspended in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4; and incubated at room temperature for 1 h to obtain multilayer vesicles. Subsequent cycles of freezing/thawing (10 s in liquid nitrogen and 50 s in a 50 °C water bath) created single layer vesicles that were then homogenized by 10 cycles of extrusion through 100-nm filters. Liposome concentration was measured according to Ref. 15Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 469-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. 0.5 μg of recombinant protein was incubated with liposomes (lipid concentration of 5 mg/ml) in 50 μl of 100 mm NaCl and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (30 min, 22 °C). The reaction mixture was diluted with 50 μl of 2.4 m sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 (final sucrose concentration of 1.2 m). The reaction was overlaid with 100 μl of 0.25 m sucrose. The samples were centrifuged (100,000 × g, 3 h, 22 °C), and 50-μl fractions from the top were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (the “pellet” is material left in the tube and solubilized with SDS sample buffer). Mitoplasts derived from swelling of 50 μg of WT yeast mitochondria (either pretreated with 0.1 mg/ml protease K or left untreated) were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant protein in 50 μl of 0.25 m SEM buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Mops, pH 7.4), for 30 min at 22 °C. 130 μl of 2.4 m SEM buffer were added (final sucrose concentration of 1.8 m), and the samples were loaded at the bottom of a sucrose gradient (500 μl of 1.8 m SEM buffer, 1 ml of 1.6 m SEM buffer, and 500 μl of 0.25 m SEM buffer) and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 4 h, 4 °C). Fractions of 250 μl were collected from the top, precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Peptide spot membranes of ScAAC2 (103 13-mers overlapping by 10 residues) and ScTim9 (38 13-mers overlapping by 11 residues) were purchased from JPT Peptide Technologies. Screening of peptide spots was performed according to Ref. 16Vergnolle M.A. Baud C. Golovanov A.P. Alcock F. Luciano P. Lian L.Y. Tokatlidis K. J. Mol.

Purification of mitochondria, in vitro import reactions, and subsequent analyses by SDS-PAGE and BN-PAGE were performed as described previously (13Vial S. Lu H. Allen S. Savory P. Thornton D.

Biol. 2005; 351: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. Tim12 Binds to Mitochondrial Inner Membrane Lipids—Tim12 is rather unique in terms of sequence (11Gentle I.E. Perry A.J. Alcock F.H. Likic V.A. Dolezal P. Ng E.T. Pursell A.W. McConville M. Naderer T. Chanez A.L. Charriere F. Adchinger C. Schneider A. Tokatlidis K. Lithgow T. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), being the only small Tim that is exclusively associated with the inner membrane. As it was reported to be poorly soluble (12Baud C. de Marcos Lousa C. Tokatlidis K. Protein Pept. Lett. 2007; 14: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), in contrast to its homologues Tim9 and Tim10, we asked whether it might have an affinity for lipids. To address this, we mixed pure Tim12 with either mitoplasts or synthetic liposomes and tested their flotation in a sucrose gradient. Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using conditions in which only the exogenous protein (His-tagged Tim12) could be detected. In these conditions, pure Tim12 floats with mitoplasts to the top fractions of the gradient (Fig. 1A). Pretreatment of mitoplasts with pyruvate kinase (which degrades protein domains facing the IMS such as Tim23 used here as a control) did not affect binding at all, suggesting Tim12 could intrinsically associate with inner membrane lipids or with a pyruvate kinase-resistant proteinaceous component. We further tested this by using synthetic liposomes instead of mitoplasts. In the presence of PC liposomes, Tim12 floated weakly to the top fractions, but this interaction increased significantly when a mixture of PC and CL (a characteristic lipid of the inner membrane) was used. As a control, Tim9 did not float with liposomes (Fig. 1, B and C). This strongly suggests that Tim12 has an intrinsic affinity for mitochondrial inner membrane lipids, a property presumably not shared by any other small Tim. Functional Domain Mapping of Tim12: The C-terminal Segment Is Essential in Vivo—A sequence alignment of Tim12 with Tim9 and Tim10 from yeast shows that Tim12 has a longer C-terminal region (Fig. 2A). Could that be the basis for its unique properties? To address this, we created appropriate deletions of Tim12 that were used as a tool to uncover the precise function of Tim12 in translocase assembly and substrate binding. The deletions we generated for Tim12 (ΔC39, ΔC18, ΔN17, and ΔN28) are shown in Fig. 2B. We first performed in vivo complementation assays to test the viability of the different Tim12 deletions by generating a GAL-TIM12 strain with endogenous TIM12 (an essential gene) under the control of the GAL1-10 promoter (Fig. 2C). The GAL-TIM12 strain grows well in galactose, but cells died in glucose after 2 days of repression (Fig. 2C, empty). Growth was fully restored when the WT TIM12 gene with the endogenous TIM12 promoter and terminator was introduced (Fig. 2C, Tim12). The four deletion mutants revealed striking differences. The shorter deletions, ΔN17 and ΔC18, efficiently restored growth of the GAL-TIM12 strain on glucose, indicating that they are fully active. However, deletion of the C-terminal 39 residues (ΔC39) was lethal. Deletion of the N-terminal 28 residues (ΔN28) also caused a serious growth defect after growth for 2 days on glucose, but when the cells were left for more than 4 days, some surviving colonies could be seen (data not shown). The N-terminal End of Tim12 Is Necessary for Import—To further investigate the molecular basis of the in vivo phenotypes, all Tim12 versions were tested for import into WT mitochondria (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, ΔN28 showed a clear import defect, in sharp contrast to all other versions of Tim12 that could properly cross the outer membrane (M), and localized, upon swelling, to the mitoplast pellet (P). As ΔN28 could not even cross the outer membrane, it must be abrogated at an early stage of import. Because Mia40 is the crucial import receptor that facilitates translocation of small Tims across the outer membrane, we tested this interaction. Import into mitoplasts was performed for ΔN28 and WT Tim12 under conditions that allow monitoring the intermediate between Mia40 and Tim (Fig. 3B) (5Milenkovic D. Gabriel K. Guiard B. Schulze-Specking A. Pfanner N. Chacinska A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22472-22480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Sideris D.P. Tokatlidis K. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 65: 1360-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In lane 2, a proper intermediate of WT Tim12 with Mia40 is seen (shown by an asterisk) that is β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive (lane 3). By contrast, ΔN28 failed to give any such intermediate (lane 5). Although we cannot rule out that ΔN28 has additional defects in its interaction with TOM subunits, the specific defect in Mia40 interaction solidifies the point that ΔN28 is affected in import. We then fused ΔN28 to the presequence of cytochrome b2, an efficient presequence that targets proteins to the IMS (18Glick B.S. Brandt A. Cunningham K. Muller S. Hallberg R.L. Schatz G. Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). This should allow us to overcome the import defect and test the functionality of ΔN28 in vivo. We found that such a fusion can be properly imported in organello (albeit somewhat more slowly than the WT; data not shown), and it restored growth of the GAL-TIM12 strain on glucose (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these data suggest that segment 17–28 of the N-terminal end of Tim12 contains necessary targeting information, but the ΔN28 deletion is not abrogated in an essential function in vivo. The C-terminal End of Tim12 Has a Crucial Role in Assembly—To further address the assembly of the other three mutants that have no apparent import defects, BN-PAGE was used (Fig. 3D). Imported WT Tim12 associates mainly with a 300- and 70-kDa complex, in agreement with previous work (10Adam A. Endres M. Sirrenberg C. Lottspeich F. Neupert W. Brunner M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Strikingly, ΔC39 was found essentially unassembled and incapable of forming either a 70- or 300-kDa complex. On the other hand, ΔN17 and ΔC18 had some clearly weaker assembly defects, which are presumably tolerated in vivo, as these mutants are viable (Fig. 2C). Because the amount of ΔC39 properly crossing the outer membrane is similar to WT, ΔN17, and ΔC18 (Fig. 3A), ΔC39 is presumably unaffected at an early stage of import but rather has a specific assembly defect. We extended the BN-PAGE analysis by monitoring the kinetics of formation of the different assembly intermediates (Fig. 3E). WT Tim12 associates with three major complexes: (i) a 140-kDa complex, which is dithiothreitol-sensitive (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 6 and 10) and represents the Mia40-bound intermediate (1Chacinska A. Pfannschmidt S. Wiedemann N. Kozjak V. Sanjuan Szklarz L.K. Schulze-Specking A. Truscott K.N. Guiard B. Meisinger C. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3735-3746Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar); (ii) the 70-kDa complex, which is dependent on Tim9 and Tim10, as it is completely absent in Tim9-ts mitochondria (compare lanes 8 and 9); and (iii) the 300-kDa TIM22 complex, which appears significantly later than the 140- and 70-kDa complexes. As shown in Fig. 3E (lanes 1–4), ΔC39 is unaffected in the early steps of Mia40 interaction in the 140-kDa complex, which is dithiothreitol-sensitive (compare lanes 2 and 11). However, formation of the 70- or 300-kDa complex is completely abolished. This analysis supports a mechanism whereby Tim12 first assembles in the 140-kDa complex with Mia40. Oxidation by Mia40 releases Tim12 in an assembly-competent state, associating probably with Tim9 and/or Tim10 to a 70-kDa complex first and then to a 300-kDa complex formed with the other subunits of the TIM22 complex. Further work is needed to substantiate this model, but collectively, these data clearly support that the C-terminal end of Tim12 is a key determinant for Tim12 assembly in vivo. The C-terminal End Has a Dual Role Mediating Both Protein-Lipid and Protein-Protein Interactions—Which bimolecular interaction or interactions are affected by the C-terminal end that is crucial for assembly? As Tim12 was shown to interact with lipids (Fig. 1) and with Tim9 (12Baud C. de Marcos Lousa C. Tokatlidis K. Protein Pept. Lett. 2007; 14: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we tested both of these possibilities. In Fig. 4, we first tested in flotation assays the interaction of all four Tim12 deletions (purified from bacteria) with either mitoplasts (Fig. 4A) or synthetic PC/CL liposomes (Fig. 4B). Neither of the smallest deletions (ΔN17 and ΔC18) had any effect on lipid binding. However, when mitoplasts were used, ΔN28 could associate efficiently with the membranes of the top fractions, whereas ΔC39 could not. The association of ΔN28 with the mitoplasts persisted even when these were treated with pyruvate kinase, mirroring the behavior of WT Tim12 (Fig. 1A). By contrast, both ΔN28 and ΔC39 are deficient in their association with liposomes (Fig. 4B). This indicates that both the N-terminal segment 18–29 and the C-terminal segment 70–91 are important for the intrinsic binding of Tim12 to synthetic PC/CL liposomes; however, for the interaction with the more physiological milieu of the inner membrane, the N-terminal end is dispensable, but the C-terminal end is crucial, probably reflecting an interaction of the C-terminal end with a yet unidentified pyruvate kinase-resistant proteinaceous component of the membrane. The specific interaction recently observed in vitro between Tim12 and Tim9 (12Baud C. de Marcos Lousa C. Tokatlidis K. Protein Pept. Lett. 2007; 14: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) may be important for the assembly of Tim12 within the protein complexes of 70 and 300 kDa (Fig. 3, D and E). To investigate a putative effect of the Tim12 deletions on Tim9 binding, we performed PepSpot arrays with immobilized Tim9 peptides (Fig. 4C). Tim12 binds to Tim9 with a similar, albeit somewhat more restricted pattern than Tim10. ΔC39 displays a clear defect in binding to Tim9, in contrast to ΔN28, which appears unaffected. We confirmed this defective binding of ΔC39 with BIAcore analysis using Tim9 immobilized on the optical chip. Tim12 binding was reduced by >70% when the C-terminal end 39 amino acids were missing (ΔC39), and even ΔC18 showed a 50% decrease in binding. These results support a very crucial role of the C-terminal end of Tim12 in binding to both lipids and Tim9. Tim12 Directly Binds the Transmembrane Segments of Substrates via Its N-terminal Segment—Once assembled properly in its native complexes, Tim12 mediates carrier insertion into the membrane. Can Tim12 directly bind the substrate like Tim10, or is it a mainly structural component like Tim9 (16Vergnolle M.A. Baud C. Golovanov A.P. Alcock F. Luciano P. Lian L.Y. Tokatlidis K. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 351: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar)? To address this, PepSpot arrays of the carrier AAC were used (Fig. 5) (19Curran S.P. Leuenberger D. Oppliger W. Koehler C.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 942-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). WT Tim12 binds to AAC with a preference for the transmembrane regions (top), similar to Tim10 binding (bottom). Binding is unaffected in the ΔN17 and ΔC18 mutants (data not shown), only slightly affected in the ΔC39 deletion, but strongly decreased in the ΔN28 deletion (middle). It therefore appears that (i) Tim12 directly binds the substrate preferably on the transmembrane regions and that (ii) its N-terminal end is important for this interaction. The first novel finding of the present study is the property of Tim12 to bind lipids. This distinguishes Tim12 from the other small Tims and is specifically dependent on cardiolipin, which is enriched in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Association of peripherally attached translocase subunits with inner membrane lipids is not unprecedented: Tim44, a peripherally attached subunit of the TIM23 translocon, also binds to inner membrane lipids (20Weiss C. Oppliger W. Vergeres G. Demel R. Jeno P. Horst M. de Kruijff B. Schatz G. Azem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tim12 and Tim44 are functionally and structurally completely different and belong to different translocases. However, their lipid binding capacity may reflect a common strategy to recruit peripherally attached components (either from the IMS for Tim12 or from the matrix for Tim44) to inner membrane translocons so as to stabilize the necessary protein-protein interactions with the other translocon subunits and the substrates. As the organization of all small Tims in specific complexes is crucial for their function, we investigated the Tim12 assembly mechanism. Deletion analysis of its structural domains, coupled with in vivo complementation assays and analysis of native complexes, revealed strikingly different properties of its N- and C-terminal ends. The N-terminal end contains targeting information but is dispensable for function, as the cytochrome b2/ΔN28 fusion, which bypasses the import defect of ΔN28, restores growth of a GAL-TIM12 strain. By contrast, the ΔC39 deletion is lethal, arguing for essential functions of the C-terminal end in vivo. Indeed, we found that this deletion abrogates important molecular interactions in organello and in vitro. First, assembly of the 70- and 300-kDa complexes (reflecting interactions with small Tims and TIM22 components, respectively) is essentially abolished. Interestingly, these defects are manifested after the interaction with Mia40, which proceeds normally. Second, in vitro binding of pure ΔC39 with lipids and mitoplasts is affected, indicating that the intrinsic interaction of the folded Tim12 with the membrane is impaired. Third, the interaction with pure Tim9 is strongly decreased. These data point to a crucial role of the C-terminal end of Tim12 in assembly. How is this relevant in terms of binding to the substrate? Here we have shown that Tim12 binds to transmembrane segments of AAC and that this interaction is mediated by the N-terminal end in the same manner as Tim10. These results identify Tim12 as an additional substrate sensor in the small Tim family. However, an important difference between Tim10 and Tim12 is that the substrate sensor N-terminal end of Tim10 is essential (21Vergnolle M.A. Alcock F.H. Petrakis N. Tokatlidis K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 1315-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), whereas in Tim12 it is dispensable, probably because of this overlap in binding the same substrate segments. On the other hand, the C-terminal assembly domain is indispensable in vivo and ensures the unique role of Tim12 as a linker subunit in the carrier import pathway. The model that we propose for the biogenesis and function of Tim12, based on our findings, is shown in Fig. 6. Tim12 is imported via the TOM channel in mitochondria in a reduced state. Mia40 acts as the receptor of Tim12, helping it to fold to its native state by oxidizing it. Oxidized Tim12 is first integrated in a 70-kDa complex that contains Tim9 (presumably the TIM10 complex). This interaction is mediated by the C terminus of Tim12. Subsequently, Tim12 is integrated in a 300-kDa complex (presumably, the TIM22 complex). Tim12 is a peripheral subunit with an intrinsic affinity for inner membrane lipids from the IMS side, just as shown for Tim44 at the matrix side of the inner membrane. We propose that Tim12 tethers the TIM10 chaperone of the intermembrane space, close to the TIM22 channel, to facilitate the transport of the substrate from the chaperone into the transporting channel, just as Tim44 brings the mutant Hsp70 chaperone close to the TIM23 channel. This linker function of Tim12 is what makes it essential for cell viability, rather than its actual interaction with the substrates, which can be overcome by the substrate binding capacity of Tim10.

Using Csrp2 (gene symbol of the mouse CRP2 gene)-deficient mice, we previously demonstrated that an absence of CRP2 enhances VSMC migration and increases neointima formation following arterial injury. Despite its importance in vascular injury, the molecular mechanisms controlling CRP2 expression in VSMC are largely unknown. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ), a key factor present in the vessel wall in the early phases of arterial response to injury, plays an important role in modulating lesion formation. Because both CRP2 and TGFβ are mediators of VSMC responses, we examined the possibility that TGFβ might regulate CRP2 expression. TGFβ significantly induced CRP2 mRNA and protein expression in VSMCs. Promoter analysis identified a conserved cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-like site (TAACGTCA) in the Csrp2 promoter that was critical for basal promoter activity and response to TGFβ. Gel mobility shift assays revealed that mainly ATF2 bound to this CRE-like element, and mutation of the CRE sequences abolished binding. TGFβ enhanced the activation of ATF2, leading to increased phospho-ATF2 levels within the DNA-protein complexes. Furthermore, ATF2-transactivated Csrp2 promoter activity and TGFβ enhanced this activation. In addition, a phosphorylation-negative ATF2 mutant construct decreased basal and TGFβ-mediated Csrp2 promoter activity. Our results show for the first time in VSMC that TGFβ activates ATF2 phosphorylation and Csrp2 gene expression via a CRE promoter element.

In normal vessels, VSMCs are quiescent, differentiated, and contractile and regulate vascular tone and blood pressure. In response to arterial injury, VSMCs undergo a phenotypic transition whereby they migrate and proliferate from the media into the intima, contributing to vascular lesion formation and arteriosclerosis (1Owens G.K.

Given their prominent cytoskeletal association and presence in the nucleus, CRPs have both a major cytoskeletal function and a role controlling gene expression (6Kadrmas J.L. Beckerle M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 920-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). A cytoskeletal function of CRP3 was demonstrated in mice lacking CRP3; those mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy with hypertrophy and heart failure after birth (17Arber S. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Hongo M. Sansig G. Borg J. Perriard J.C. Chien K.R. Caroni P. Cell. 1997; 88: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Ultrastructural analysis revealed dramatic disruption of cardiomyocyte cytoarchitecture (17Arber S. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Hongo M. Sansig G. Borg J. Perriard J.C. Chien K.R. Caroni P.

Further supporting a function of CRP3 in maintaining the cytoarchitecture of striated muscle cells, the Drosophila homolog of muscle LIM protein, Mlp84B, was recently demonstrated to cooperate with d-titin to maintain muscle structural integrity (22Clark K.A. Bland J.M. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2066-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We recently identified a key role for the LIM domain-containing protein, CRP2, in the development of arteriosclerosis (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Following femoral artery wire injury, CRP2 expression persisted in the first few days and then decreased but was not abolished in the vessel wall by 14 days (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), implicating a role for CRP2 in vascular injury. By gene deletion experiments, we demonstrated that a lack of CRP2 increased neointima formation following arterial injury in mice (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Importantly, the increased intimal thickening in Csrp2 (gene symbol of the mouse CRP2 gene)-deficient mice correlated with enhanced VSMC migration into the intima (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This migratory role of CRP2 in arterial SMC emphasizes a cytoskeleton-associated function of CRP2 protein. In response to injury, many cytokines and growth factors are released within injured blood vessels (1Owens G.K. Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2598) Google Scholar, 23Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9989) Google Scholar, 24Tedgui A. Mallat Z. Physiol. Rev. 2006; 86: 515-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar). These mediators in turn alter gene expression patterns of vascular cells, including SMC marker genes, leading to phenotypic modulation of VSMC and neointima formation. Despite its important function in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis, the molecular mechanisms controlling CRP2 expression in the context of vascular injury remain largely unknown. We showed previously that one of these factors, PDGF-BB, down-regulates CRP2 mRNA expression (10Jain M.K. Fujita K.P. Hsieh C.-M. Endege W.O. Sibinga N.E. Yet S.-F. Kashiki S. Lee W.-S. Perrella M.A. Haber E. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10194-10199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Given that an absence of CRP2 promotes VSMC migration both in vitro and in vivo (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), induction of CRP2 by factors present in the injured vessels might serve as a protective mechanism and reduces VSMC migration and subsequent neointima formation. In the current study, we sought to identify factors, present in the context of vascular injury, that up-regulated CRP2. CRP2 regulation by these factors might ultimately protect against intimal thickening. TGFβ, a key factor present in the vessel wall in the early phases of the arterial response to injury plays an important role in modulating lesion formation. We identified that TGFβ induces CRP2 protein and mRNA expression. Analysis of the Csrp2 promoter by reporter gene transfection experiments revealed that a conserved CRE-like motif located at bp –461 to –454 of the Csrp2 gene was required for both basal and TGFβ-induced activation of the Csrp2 promoter. We further demonstrated that TGFβ activates ATF2 phosphorylation and Csrp2 gene expression via a CRE promoter element. Cell Culture and Reagents—Primary VSMCs were isolated from mouse or rat aortas and cultured in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium as described previously (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 25Günther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Cells were passaged every 3–5 days, and experiments were performed on cells 6–8 passages from primary culture. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Western Blot Analysis—Approximately 1 × 106 VSMCs were plated on 100-mm cell culture dishes and incubated overnight. Cells were treated with human recombinant TGFβ (10 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) for various times and lysed in extraction buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2% SDS) containing protease inhibitors (Complete™; Roche Applied Science). Cell extracts were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE using Novex gels (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce), and 20 μg of protein were loaded per lane. Separated proteins were then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell), followed by immunoblotting (26Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C.-M. Maemura K. Kobzik L. Wiesel P. Christou H. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R23-R29Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with CRP2-(91–98) antiserum (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and monoclonal α-tubulin antibody (Sigma) to verify equivalent loading. To assess phosphorylation of ATF2 and CREB, cells were plated, incubated overnight, serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium) for 24 h, and then stimulated with TGFβ. Protein extracts were prepared in extraction buffer containing protease inhibitor Complete™ and phosphatase inhibitor mixture 1 and 2 (Sigma) at the indicated time points. Membranes were incubated with antibodies for phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) (phosphorylated Thr71 of human ATF2; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) that recognizes both Thr51/Thr53 dually phosphorylated and Thr51 singly phosphorylated mouse ATF2, total ATF2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-CREB that recognizes phosphorylated Ser133 of CREB (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, VA), or total CREB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Northern Blot Analysis and Real Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was isolated from VSMCs using the RNeasy Mini RNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and Northern blot analysis was performed as described (26Yet S.-F. Perrella M.A. Layne M.D. Hsieh C.-M. Maemura K. Kobzik L. Wiesel P. Christou H. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: R23-R29Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The filters were hybridized with a random primed 32P-labeled mouse CRP2 cDNA open reading frame probe (15Yet S.-F. Folta S.C. Jain M.K. Hsieh C.-M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Zhang D. Marria P.B.

To correct for loading differences, the filters were hybridized to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide complementary to 18 S ribosomal RNA. The signal intensity was measured on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). In cyclohexamide experiments, 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA using the SuperScript III first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). Real time quantitative PCR was performed with the 7500 real time PCR system (ABI) using 2× SYBR Green PCR master mix (ABI) and 1% of the starting 1 μg of RNA with the following primers for CRP2: forward, 5′-CTGACTGAGAAAGAAGGCGAAATC-3′; reverse, 5′-TGCTGGCTGTTTCACAGTAGTGA-3′. β-Actin was used as the internal control with the following primers: forward, 5′-GAGAGGTATCCTGACCCTGAAG-3′; reverse, 5′-TGATCTGGGTCATCTTTTCACGG-3′. Quantification was performed by the comparative CT method. Migration Assays—To assess migration, wild type and Csrp2 null (Csrp2–/–) VSMCs (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were serum-starved (0.5% fetal bovine serum in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium) for 24 h and treated with or without TGFβ (10 ng/ml) for 12 h, and then migration assays were performed as described (16Wei J. Gorman T.E. Liu X. Ith B. Tseng A. Chen Z. Simon D.I. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were placed in the upper chamber of 6-well transwell plates (8-μm pore size; Costar) in triplicate (300,000 cells/well). The bottom chambers were filled with 0.5% fetal bovine serum medium containing PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml) (Peprotech) as a chemoattractant. Cells migrating through the filters after 2 h were quantified and normalized to the cell number of wild type without TGFβ treatment. Luciferase Reporter and Expression Plasmid Constructs—The mouse Csrp2 luciferase reporter plasmid –795Csrp2-luc was described previously (27Chang Y.-F. Wei J. Liu X. Chen Y.-H. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1675-H1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To generate a series of 5′-deletion constructs, Csrp2 promoter deletion fragments were generated by PCR with the use of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and cloned into the luciferase reporter pGL2-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI). These constructs share a common 3′-end at bp +40 but differ at the 5′-end at bp –573, –549, –480, and –438. With the –795Csrp2-luc construct as a template, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Pfu polymerase to create an internal deletion of bp –480 to –438 to generate the –795Δ(480/438)Csrp2-luc construct. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to mutate the CRE site from –461TAACGTCA to CACCGTAA (mutated bases are underlined) to generate the –795CREmutCsrp2-luc construct. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mouse ATF2 expression plasmid pCMV·SPORT6-ATF2 was purchased from Invitrogen. The open reading frame of ATF2 was amplified with Pfu polymerase using pCMV·SPORT6-ATF2 as a template and cloned into pFLAG-CMV5 vector (Sigma) to generate pFLAG-CMV5-ATF2. Site-directed mutagenesis was then performed using Pfu polymerase to mutate the three potential phosphorylation sites (Thr51, Thr53, and Ser72) to alanines (T51A, T53A, and S72A) (28Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) to generate phosphorylation-negative mutant pFLAG-CMV5-ATF2-AAA, which also functions as a dominant negative mutant (28Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Transient Transfection Assays—Approximately 1.6 × 105 VSMCs were plated onto each well of 6-well plates and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were then transfected using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) (21Chang D.F. Belaguli N.S. Iyer D. Roberts W.B. Wu S.P. Dong X.R. Marx J.G. Moore M.S. Beckerle M.C. Majesky M.W. Schwartz R.J. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 107-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To correct for differences in transfection efficiency, 500 ng each of the luciferase plasmids and pCMVβ (Clontech) were cotransfected into cells. Two hours following transfection, cells were treated with or without TGFβ (10 ng/ml). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured 24 h later; luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. For cotransfection experiments, –795Csrp2-luc (0.33 μg/well) and expression plasmid (0.67 μg/well) pCMV-CREB (Clontech), pCMV·SPORT6-ATF2, or empty vector were cotransfected into VSMCs. Similarly, for phosphorylation-negative ATF2 experiments, –795Csrp2-luc and pFLAG-CMV5-ATF2-AAA or empty vector pFLAG-CMV5 were cotransfected into VSMCs. For dominant negative Smad3 experiments, –795Csrp2-luc or 3TP-Lux (29Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) was cotransfected with pRK5-Smad3ΔC, which lacks C-terminal phosphorylation and activation sites (30Zhang Y. Feng X. We R. Derynck R. Nature. 1996; 383: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar) or empty pRK5 vector into VSMCs. Two hours following transfection, the indicated wells were treated with or without TGFβ. Because pCMVβ contains a consensus CRE site for potential ATF2 binding (data not shown), we omitted pCMVβ for transfection efficiency control and normalized luciferase activity to total protein content as described by Owens and co-workers (31Yoshida T. Sinha S. Dandre F. Wamhoff B.R. Hoofnagle M.H. Kremer B.E. Wang D.Z. Olson E.N. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Each construct was transfected at least three times, and each transfection was performed in triplicate. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared from VSMCs, and DNA-binding assays were performed as described (27Chang Y.-F. Wei J. Liu X. Chen Y.-H. Layne M.D. Yet S.-F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: H1675-H1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Complementary oligonucleotides from the Csrp2 promoter bp –467 to –448 containing the CRE-like sequence (in boldface type), 5′-TTTTCATAACGTCATTTGTT-3′ or three bases mutated (underlined) in the core sequence 5′-TTTTCACACCGTAATTTGTT-3′, and the CRE consensus sequence 5′-ATTGCCTGACGTCAGAGAGC-3′ (32Ishida A. Fujita N. Kitazawa R. Tsuruo T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26217-26224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) were synthesized. Additional mutant oligonucleotides with one or two bases mutated (underlined) in the core sequence (in boldface type) were also synthesized: mut1, 5′-TTTTCACAACGTCATTTGTT-3′ and mut2 5′-TTTTCACAACGCCATTTGTT-3′. Annealed complementary oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). To determine the specificity of the DNA-protein complexes, competition assays were performed with a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. To characterize the specific DNA-binding proteins, nuclear proteins were incubated with antibodies to ATF-2, CREB, or c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect phosphorylated proteins in the DNA-protein complexes, nuclear proteins were incubated with antibodies to phospho-ATF2 (Thr71) (Cell Signaling Technology) or phospho-CREB (Ser133) (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Mouse VSMCs were cultured in 150-mm dishes and fixed with formaldehyde as described in the instructions of the EZ ChIP chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). The fixed cells were harvested and prepared for chromatin immunoprecipitation according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. Following DNA fragmentation by sonication, aliquots of the samples equivalent to 2 × 106 cells were used in each reaction and subsequently incubated with 5 μg of CREB antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-CREB (Ser133) antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), or normal rabbit IgG (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions). Quantitative PCR (as described under “Northern Blot Analysis and Real Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction”) was subsequently performed using immunoprecipitated DNA. Aliquots of samples equivalent to 1% of initial cell lysate for each reaction were processed, and DNA was purified to use as input DNA control. The primers used to amplify a 165-bp fragment of the mouse Csrp2-CRE were 5′-GTGGGTTTCTTCCCCCCTCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CAGGATAGTCTCTGGTCAGAATC-3′ (reverse), and the primers used to amplify a 92-bp fragment of the mouse cyclin D1-CRE were 5′-CTGCCCGGCTTTGATCTCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCTGGAGGCTGCAGGAC-3′ (reverse). As an additional negative control, a 164-bp fragment within intron 1 of the Csrp2 gene was also amplified by quantitative PCR with the following primers: forward, 5′-TTCCCTTACTGCGGTGTCTCTC-3′; reverse, 5′-ACACATATCCTGGGGGCTGAAG-3′. TGFβ Induces CRP2 Expression in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells—TGFβ, a key factor present in the vessel wall in the early phases of arterial response to injury, plays important roles in modulating lesion formation (33Majesky M.W. Lindner V. Twardzik D.R. Schwartz S.M. Reidy M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 904-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Because CRP2 also has a significant role in modulating this response, we examined the possibility that TGFβ might regulate CRP2 expression. We treated VSMCs with TGFβ and evaluated CRP2 protein levels by Western blot analysis. The physiological concentrations of TGFβ have been reported to be ∼2–3 ng/ml in plasma and cells (34Meng J.

However, a higher concentration of 10 ng/ml has been routinely used in cultured cells (34Meng J. Thongngarm T. Nakajima M. Yamashita N. Ohta K. Bates C.A. Grunwald G.K. Rosenwasser L.J. Int. Arch.

To mimic the likely higher concentrations of cytokines released at the injured arterial microenvironment we used 10 ng/ml TGFβ for our studies. TGFβ induced CRP2 protein expression as early as 2 h, and the induction continued at the 4 h time point (Fig. 1A). A 3-fold induction was observed at 8 h, and this level of induction was maintained at 24 h when compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1A). Similar to the protein results, Northern blot analysis revealed that TGFβ induced CRP2 mRNA expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). A maximal 3-fold induction was observed at 4 h, which preceded maximal protein induction at 8 h (Fig. 1A), and was maintained at 24 h when compared with untreated controls (Fig. 1B). To determine the significance of CRP2 induction, we treated wild type and Csrp2–/– VSMC with or without TGFβ for 12 h to obtain maximal induction of CRP2 in wild type cells and then performed migration assays. Interestingly, compared with untreated controls, TGFβ treatment reduced wild type VSMC migration by ∼50%, whereas Csrp2–/– VSMC migration was not affected (Fig. 1C), indicating that up-regulation of CRP2 correlated with a blunted VSMC motility. TGFβ Does Not Alter the Half-life of CRP2 mRNA—To begin to elucidate the mechanisms underlying CRP2 mRNA induction, we performed experiments with the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the small GTPase Cdc42 controls polarized actin organization and exocytosis toward the bud. Gic2, a Cdc42 effector, is targeted to the bud tip and plays an important role in early bud formation. The GTP-bound Cdc42 interacts with Gic2 through the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain located at the N terminus of Gic2 and activates Gic2 during bud emergence. Here we identify a polybasic region in Gic2 adjacent to the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding domain that directly interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that this interaction is necessary for the polarized localization of Gic2 to the bud tip and is important for the function of Gic2 in cell polarization. We propose that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and Cdc42 act in concert to regulate polarized localization and function of Gic2 during polarized cell growth in the budding yeast.

Generation of cell polarity is critical for many basic cellular functions such as nutrient transport across epithelial cells and neuronal transmission in neurons. Cell polarization generally occurs by the delivery of proteins and lipids to specific sites on the plasma membrane (PM), 4The abbreviations used are: PM, plasma membrane; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PH, pleckstrin homology; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. 4The abbreviations used are: PM, plasma membrane; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; LUV, large unilamellar vesicles; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PS, phosphatidylserine; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PH, pleckstrin homology; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein. thus generating distinct cellular domains. Budding yeast is an excellent model organism for the study of cell polarity because polarized actin organization and membrane traffic are important for bud formation and major proteins involved in cell polarization are conserved in higher eukaryotes (1Johnson D.I.

Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins and a master regulator of cell polarity, controls polarized organization of actin cables and the exocytosis machinery for bud emergence and enlargement (3Park H.O. Bi E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 48-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 4Pruyne D. Bretscher A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 571-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gic2, and its homolog, Gic1, are a pair of Cdc42 effectors that each contain an N-terminal Cdc42/Rac Interactive Binding (CRIB) domain, which interacts with GTP-bound Cdc42 (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Deletion of GIC1 and GIC2 together, but not either one alone, causes cells to arrest in large, round, and unbudded morphologies at 37 °C, indicative of the loss of cell polarity (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gic2 is localized to the site of bud emergence and at tips of small buds in yeast and is required for polarized actin organization during budding at 37 °C (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gic2 is thought to function in polarized growth by linking activated Cdc42 to proteins that regulate actin organization, such as Bni1, Spa2, and Bud6 (7Jaquenoud M. Peter M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6244-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that Gic1 and Gic2 are also involved in the recruitment of septins to the presumptive bud site at the beginning of the cell cycle (8Iwase M. Luo J. Nagaraj S. Longtine M. Kim H.B. Haarer B.K. Caruso C. Tong Z. Pringle J.R. Bi E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1110-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Gic1 and Gic2 have overlapping functions, as cells that have lost either Gic1 or Gic2 are mostly normal in morphology and growth whereas cells that have lost both Gic proteins have morphological defects (including defects in actin polarization) as well as a severe growth defect at 37 °C (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Gic2 is expressed in a cell cycle-dependent manner with its expression peaking during bud emergence, and Gic2 is degraded shortly after bud emergence via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (7Jaquenoud M. Peter M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6244-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Binding of Gic2 to GTP-Cdc42 is a prerequisite for degradation, suggesting that Gic2 levels are down-regulated after Gic2 fulfills its role in cell polarization (9Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Here we report that Gic2 directly interacts with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) on the PM. We have identified a polybasic region within the N terminus of Gic2 that mediates this interaction. Mutations in this domain or depletion of PI(4,5)P2 from the PM disrupted the polarized localization of Gic2 in the buds. Further genetic and cell biological analyses demonstrated that the PI(4,5)P2 and Cdc42 function in concert to control the function of Gic2 as a regulator of polarized cell growth. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Standard methods were used for yeast medium and genetic manipulations (10Sherman F. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 194. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 3-21Google Scholar). All the major strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Mutagenesis on Gic2-GFP (pRS316-ADH-Gic2-GFP) was performed using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and verified by nucleotide sequencing. Various gic2 N-terminal (gic2NT) mutants were generated from a GIC2 2μ plasmid by PCR using different mutagenesis primers and subcloned into the centromere-based p415TEF vector (11Mumberg D.

Sun X. Zhang J. Guo W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1500-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). GFP-Gic2 was scored as polarized when it appeared as a single patch in the bud of small budded cells. For actin staining, cells were stained with Alexa Fluoro 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) after fixation and permeabilization as described previously (13He B. Xi F. Zhang X. Zhang J. Guo W. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4053-4065Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Ras Rescue Assay—Characterization of the proteins that bind to PI(4,5)P2 at the PM by Ras-rescuing assay was performed as described previously (14Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To generate Gic2N-RasQ61L(ΔF) fusion constructs, PCR fragments containing the N terminus of GIC2 were subcloned into the p3SOB-L2 vector (a gift from Dr. Lemmon). The resulting constructs were transformed into the cdc25ts mutant strain. Transformants were streaked out onto synthetic complete-leucine plates and incubated at the permissive (25 °C) or restrictive (37 °C) temperature for 3 days. RasQ61L(ΔF) fused with PLCδ-PH and Dynamin-PH, respectively, were used as positive and negative controls. Preparation of GST-Gic2NT Protein—Escherichia coli expressing GST-tagged Gic2NT wild-type and mutant proteins were induced overnight at 18 °C, and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise stated. Bacterial pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and sonicated in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; 1% Triton X-100 was added to increase solubility. The solution was centrifuged at 14,500 × g for 25 min, and the supernatant was filtered to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (prewashed with phosphate-buffered saline) for 1.5–2 h and then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (all washes were done at 500 × g for 5 min). GST-Gic2NT on beads were used directly for the in vitro binding assay, while GST-Gic2NT for the large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) sedimentation assay were first eluted from the GST beads with 30 mm reduced glutathione in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and dialyzed with HNa100 buffer. In Vitro Binding of Cdc42 and Gic2NT—His6-Cdc42 was prepared using the same protocol as the preparation of GST-Gic2NT, except that the bacterial pellets were washed in extraction buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 300 mm NaCl), 1% Triton X-100 was not added after sonication, the protein was eluted with extraction buffer + 200 mm imidazole, and the protein was dialyzed with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, + 150 mm NaCl. GST-Gic2NT and GST-gic2NT(pb) on beads were blocked with blocking buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at 4 °C. His6-Cdc42 was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT to strip the nucleotides and then incubated at room temperature for 60 min in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm GTPγS. The nucleotide-loaded His6-Cdc42 was added to the blocked GST proteins and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were washed in blocking buffer minus bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 1× SDS sample buffer. 10 μg of His6-Cdc42 and 10 μg of GST-Gic2NT protein were used for each reaction. LUV Sedimentation Assay—LUV sedimentation assay was performed as described previously (15Hokanson D. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). LUVs with 100 nm diameter were prepared by size extrusion. Lipid components were mixed at different molar ratios, dried with nitrogen stream, and resuspended at a concentration of 2 mm in a buffer containing 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and 176 mm sucrose. The mixed lipids were subjected to five cycles of freeze-thaw and 1 min of bath sonication before being passed through 100-nm filters using a mini-extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL). LUVs were dialyzed overnight in the HNa100 buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT). The percentages of phosphatidylserine (PS) and PI(4,5)P2 indicated in the text are the molar percentages of total PS and PI(4,5)P2, with the remainder being phosphatidylcholine (PC). Lipid concentrations are given as total lipid. The binding of 300 nm Gic2 to LUVs was determined by sedimentation assays conducted in 200 μl of total volume in an ultracentrifuge TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA). The tubes were preincubated for 1 h in a 50-μm solution of PC in the HNa100 buffer to prevent nonspecific binding of Gic2 to polycarbonate centrifuge tubes. Sucrose-loaded LUVs were precipitated at 150,000 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. The supernatants and pellets were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with SYPRO red (Invitrogen) for quantification of free and bound materials with the ImageQuant software. Subcellular Fractionation—Protocol for subcellular fractionation of yeast lysates was adapted from Goud et al. (16Goud B. Salminen A. Walworth N.C. Novick P.J. Cell. 1988; 53: 753-768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in synthetic complete medium plus the appropriate amino acids overnight at 25 °C; at an optical density of ∼0.6 they were shifted to 37 °C for 90 min. Cells were washed in 10 mm NaN3 and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in spheroplast wash buffer (1.4 m sorbiol, 50 mm KPi, pH 7.5, and 10 mm NaN3), supplemented with 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.15 mg/ml zymolyase 100T. The spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.8 m sorbitol, 10 mm triethanolamine, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2, and a protease inhibitor mixture including AEBSF (4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride), E64, pepstatin A, and 1,10-phenanthroline), left on ice for 10 min, transferred to a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Glass Co., Vineland, NJ), and lysed with 20 strokes from the A pestle. Cells were then spun at 500 × g for 10 min to generate the pellet (P1) and the supernatant (S1) fractions. The supernatant was then spun for 13,000 × g for 30 min to generate the P2 and S2 fractions. The protein concentration in S2 was used to normalize samples. For whole cell lysates, after spheroplast formation cells were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were left on ice for 10 min and were then broken by vortex. The Polybasic Region of Gic2 Binds to PI(4,5)P2 on the Plasma Membrane—The Cdc42 effector Gic2 is localized to the bud tip in budding yeast and is required for bud emergence (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The N terminus of Gic2 contains both a Cdc42-interacting CRIB domain and a polybasic region containing a number of positively charged (basic) residues (Fig. 1A). The exocyst component Sec3 is another downstream effector of Cdc42 (17Zhang X. Bi E. Novick P. Du L. Kozminski K.G. Lipschultz J. Guo W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46745-46750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered that an N-terminal polybasic region adjacent to the Cdc42 binding domain of Sec3 directly interacts with PI(4,5)P2 (18Zhang X. Orlando K. He B. Xi F. Zhang J. Zajac A. Guo W. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 180: 145-158Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). While the N terminus of Sec3 is important for its function in exocytosis, a gic2-sec3 chimera with the N terminus of Sec3 replaced by the N terminus of Gic2 behaves like the wild-type SEC3 in yeast cells. Furthermore, mutations in the polybasic region of gic2-sec3 chimera abolished its ability to replace SEC3 in yeast cells (18Zhang X. Orlando K. He B. Xi F. Zhang J. Zajac A. Guo W. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 180: 145-158Crossref Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These data suggested to us that the polybasic region of Gic2 might play an important role in the localization and/or function of Gic2 in cell polarity. To determine whether Gic2 can interact with the PM, we first performed a Ras rescue assay. Like the yeast two-hybrid system for testing protein-protein interactions, the Ras rescue assay provides an efficient assay of protein-lipid interaction in yeast cells. This assay employs a yeast temperature-sensitive strain with mutations in CDC25, which encodes the guaninenucleotide exchange factor for Ras. At the restrictive temperature of 37 °C, Ras-GDP at the PM cannot be converted to Ras-GTP and cells cannot grow (14Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The suspected PM binding domain is then fused to RasQ61L(ΔF), the constitutively active form of Ras lacking its farnesylation signal for PM association. If the domain can, in fact, associate with the PM, RasQ61L(ΔF) will be localized to the PM and the mutant CDC25 cells will be “rescued” at 37 °C. The Ras rescue assay has been used to identify proteins that bind to PI(4,5)P2 in the inner leaflet of the PM in yeast (14Isakoff S.J. Cardozo T. Andreev J. Li Z. Ferguson K.M. Abagyan R. Lemmon M.A. Aronheim A. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5374-5387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We fused the N terminus of Gic2 (amino acids 1–155) containing both the polybasic region and the CRIB domain to RasQ61L(ΔF). If the wild-type or mutant Gic2NT can associate with the PM, the activated Ras protein RasQ61L(ΔF) can be brought to the PM, therefore bypassing the need of Cdc25 to allow cell survival at 37 °C. Beginning with the Gic2 N-terminal wild-type construct (“gic2NT”), we mutated some of the basic residues within the polybasic region: K119A, K120A, and K121A (“gic2NT(3AA pb)”), and K109A, K110A, K119A, K120A, and K121A (“gic2NT(5AA pb)”). We also mutated key residues within the CRIB domain that have been shown previously to be essential for Cdc42 binding (I134A, S135A, P137A, “gic2NT(crib)”) (19Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). We found that cells containing RasQ61L(ΔF) fused with wild-type gic2NT and gic2NT(crib) grew at 37 °C, but those fused with gic2NT(3AA pb) or gic2NT(5AA pb) failed to grow (Fig. 1B). The positive control, a fusion protein containing the PLCδ-PH domain, and the negative control, a fusion protein containing the dynamin-PH domain that has a weaker affinity for PI(4,5)P2 (20Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), worked as expected. These results suggest that the polybasic domain mediates the association of Gic2 with the PM. Polybasic regions on a number of proteins have been found to directly interact with negatively charged phospholipids such as PI(4,5)P2 on the inner leaflet of the PM (21McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 22Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Várnai P. Balla T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1282-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether gic2NT binds directly to PI(4,5)P2 and whether the polybasic region mediates this interaction. We performed an in vitro lipid binding assay by examining the binding of recombinant GST-gic2NT to large LUVs containing various phospholipids by co-sedimentation. As shown in Fig. 1C, GST-gic2NT bound to LUVs containing 5% PI(4,5)P2, but not 20% PS or 100% PC. GST-gic2NT did not bind to PI and showed weaker binding to PI(3,5)P2 (supplemental Fig. 1). GST-gic2NT (5AA pb) was unable to bind to PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the polybasic region of Gic2 is critical for its ability to bind to PI(4,5)P2. Similar to GST-gic2NT, GST-gic2NT(crib) was still able to bind to PI(4,5)P2, indicating that the CRIB domain is not required for Gic2 to bind to PI(4,5)P2. To measure the affinity of these interactions, we examined the binding of gic2NT to LUVs with increasing lipid concentrations. The bound GST-gic2NT was quantified and plotted against the total lipid concentration with the equation: B = BmaxX/[Kd + X]. (Kd is the dissociation constant; X and B represent the concentrations of the free Gic2 and the bound Gic2, respectively, Fig. 1D). The Kd was calculated by nonlinear regression; the Kd for 5% PI(4,5)P2 alone is 56.2 μm and for a mixture of 5% PI(4,5)P2 and 20% PS is 55.4 μm. The gic2NT(pb) mutant remains capable of interacting with Cdc42 (Fig. 1E). Gic2 Localization at the Bud Tip Is Disrupted in a Yeast Mutant Lacking PI(4,5)P2 at the PM—The above Ras rescue assay and in vitro binding experiments suggest that Gic2 binds to PI(4,5)P2 via its N-terminal polybasic region. To further investigate the role of PI(4,5)P2 binding in Gic2 function, we examined the localization of GFP-Gic2 in cells lacking PI(4,5)P2 at the PM. We used a temperature-sensitive mutant of MSS4, which encodes a major PI(4)P 5-kinase that catalyzes the production of PI(4,5)P2 at the PM. At the restrictive temperature of 38 °C, the level of PI(4,5)P2 in the PM is greatly reduced in the mutant cells (23Desrivières S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15787-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We found that small budded control cells (MSS4) displayed polarized GFP-Gic2 at either 25 or 38 °C (Fig. 2). A similar percentage of the mss4 mutant cells with polarized GFP-Gic2 was observed at 25 °C, albeit the signal was not as concentrated as that in the wild-type cells, possibly as a result of a slightly reduced PI(4,5)P2 level in the mss4 mutant even at 25 °C (23Desrivières S. Cooke F.T. Parker P.J. Hall M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15787-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 24Stefan C.J. Audhya A. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 542-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, at 38 °C, <10% of the small budded mss4 cells displayed polarized GFP-Gic2. Together, the results suggest that Gic2 polarization at the bud tip is regulated by PI(4,5)P2. The N-terminal Polybasic Region of Gic2 Is Important for Its Function in Cell Polarity—A previous report found that overexpression of the N terminus (amino acids 1–208) of Gic2 under an inducible promoter resulted in large and round cells (9Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the N terminus of Gic2 may be dominant negative in yeast cells. To determine whether the polybasic region is important for the function of Gic2 in cell polarity, we overexpressed gic2NT (amino acids 1–155), gic2NT containing mutations in the CRIB domain (gic2NT(crib)), or gic2NT containing mutations in the polybasic region (gic2NT(3AA pb) and gic2NT(5AA pb)) in yeast cells using a centromere-based vector under the TEF promoter. As shown in Fig. 3B, expression of gic2NT resulted in slower cell growth. We also found that a higher level of expression using a 2μ vector resulted in cell inviability (not shown). Cells transformed with vector alone had no effect on growth. Overexpression of the N terminus harboring mutations in the CRIB domain or the polybasic region did not affect cell growth, even though they were expressed at even higher levels than gic2NT in yeast cells (Fig. 3A). This result suggests that the polybasic region, as well as the CRIB domain, is necessary to confer the dominant negative effect of gic2NT in the inhibition of growth. We next examined the morphology of the cells expressing the above gic2NT constructs. Consistent with the previous report (9Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), cells expressing gic2NT were abnormal in shape and significantly larger than cells expressing vector alone (Fig. 3C), suggesting a defect in cell polarity. In contrast, cells expressing gic2NT(crib), gic2NT(3AA pb), and gic2NT(5AA pb) mutants were approximately the same size as the vector control cells (Fig. 3, C and D). We have also examined F-actin in these cells by Alexa Fluoro 488 phalloidin staining. Actin was depolarized in large cells expressing gic2NT, but not in cells expressing gic2NT mutants (Fig. 3E). Therefore, the polarity defects observed with expression of gic2NT require both the CRIB domain and the polybasic region. This dominant negative analysis suggests that the CRIB domain and the polybasic region are necessary for Gic2 function in cell polarity. The Polybasic Region and the CRIB Domain Are Important for Gic2 Localization—Phospholipids are important regulators of intracellular functions. Our observation that Gic2 contains a polybasic region that interacts with PI(4,5)P2 brings up the possibility that the polybasic region is involved in regulating the localization of Gic2 in yeast cells. To determine whether this is the case, we expressed full-length GFP-GIC2, GFP-gic2(crib), GFP-gic2(pb) (5AA), or a combination of both mutations, GFP-gic2 (crib pb) in gic2Δ cells. We grew the cells at 25 °C and then shifted to 37 °C for 90 min, because it is known that Gic1 and Gic2 play an essential role in polarized growth at 37 °C (5Brown J.L. Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Chant J. Peter M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2972-2982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 6Chen G.C. Kim Y.J. Chan C.S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2958-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We found that GFP-Gic2 was polarized to the bud tip in the majority of small budded cells (74%) (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, a significantly smaller percentage of small budded cells displayed polarized GFP-gic2(crib) (24%), GFP-gic2(pb) (26%), or GFP-gic2(crib pb) (12%). Therefore, the polybasic region and CRIB domain are both critical for polarization of Gic2. Because the wild-type Gic1 is present in the gic2Δ strain, these cells are normal in morphology. Thus, the observed depolarization of gic2 variants was not a result of general loss of cell polarity in the cells. Because Gic2 is specifically expressed shortly before budding and is ubiquitinated and degraded after the small budded stage (7Jaquenoud M. Peter M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6244-6258Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 9Jaquenoud M. Gulli M.P. Peter K. Peter M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5360-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), most large budded cells do not have GFP-Gic2 signal. On the other hand, the gic2 variants were frequently found in cells at later stages of the cell cycle. Consistent with this finding, we found greater amounts of GFP-gic2 mutants as compared with wild-type GFP-Gic2 in whole cell lysates (Fig. 4C). To further verify that the level of GFP-Gic2 was controlled by ubiquitination and degrad"
https://openalex.org/W2039446355,"PDHK2 is a mitochondrial protein kinase that phosphorylates pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, thereby down-regulating the oxidation of pyruvate. Here, we present the crystal structure of PDHK2 bound to the inner lipoyl-bearing domain of dihydrolipoamide transacetylase (L2) determined with or without bound adenylyl imidodiphosphate. Both structures reveal a PDHK2 dimer complexed with two L2 domains. Comparison with apo-PDHK2 shows that L2 binding causes rearrangements in PDHK2 structure that affect the L2- and E1-binding sites. Significant differences are found between PDHK2 and PDHK3 with respect to the structure of their lipoyllysine-binding cavities, providing the first structural support to a number of studies showing that these isozymes are markedly different with respect to their affinity for the L2 domain. Both structures display a novel type II potassium-binding site located on the PDHK2 interface with the L2 domain. Binding of potassium ion at this site rigidifies the interface and appears to be critical in determining the strength of L2 binding. Evidence is also presented that potassium ions are indispensable for the cross-talk between the nucleotide- and L2-binding sites of PDHK2. The latter is believed to be essential for the movement of PDHK2 along the surface of the transacetylase scaffold."
https://openalex.org/W2074841054,"Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) triggers conformational movements in the alpha(1) and beta(2) pre-M1 regions that are associated with channel gating. At high concentrations, the barbiturate pentobarbital opens GABA(A)R channels with similar conductances as GABA, suggesting that their open state structures are alike. Little, however, is known about the structural rearrangements induced by barbiturates. Here, we examined whether pentobarbital activation triggers movements in the GABA(A)R pre-M1 regions. Alpha(1)beta(2) GABA(A)Rs containing cysteine substitutions in the pre-M1 alpha(1) (K219C, K221C) and beta(2) (K213C, K215C) subunits were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and analyzed using two-electrode voltage clamp. The cysteine substitutions had little to no effect on GABA and pentobarbital EC(50) values. Tethering chemically diverse thiol-reactive methanethiosulfonate reagents onto alpha(1)K219C and alpha(1)K221C affected GABA- and pentobarbital-activated currents differently, suggesting that the pre-M1 structural elements important for GABA and pentobarbital current activation are distinct. Moreover, pentobarbital altered the rates of cysteine modification by methanethiosulfonate reagents differently than GABA. For alpha(1)K221Cbeta(2) receptors, pentobarbital decreased the rate of cysteine modification whereas GABA had no effect. For alpha(1)beta(2)K215C receptors, pentobarbital had no effect whereas GABA increased the modification rate. The competitive GABA antagonist SR-95531 and a low, non-activating concentration of pentobarbital did not alter their modification rates, suggesting that the GABA- and pentobarbital-mediated changes in rates reflect gating movements. Overall, the data indicate that the pre-M1 region is involved in both GABA- and pentobarbital-mediated gating transitions. Pentobarbital, however, triggers different movements in this region than GABA, suggesting their activation mechanisms differ."
https://openalex.org/W2039991888,"In Escherichia coli, the complex II superfamily members succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (SQR) and quinol:fumarate reductase (QFR) participate in aerobic and anaerobic respiration, respectively. Complex II enzymes catalyze succinate and fumarate interconversion at the interface of two domains of the soluble flavoprotein subunit, the FAD binding domain and the capping domain. An 11-amino acid loop in the capping domain (Thr-A234 to Thr-A244 in quinol:fumarate reductase) begins at the interdomain hinge and covers the active site. Amino acids of this loop interact with both the substrate and a proton shuttle, potentially coordinating substrate binding and the proton shuttle protonation state. To assess the loopŉs role in catalysis, two threonine residues were mutated to alanine: QFR Thr-A244 (act-T; Thr-A254 in SQR), which hydrogen-bonds to the substrate at the active site, and QFR Thr-A234 (hinge-T; Thr-A244 in SQR), which is located at the hinge and hydrogen-bonds the proton shuttle. Both mutations impair catalysis and decrease substrate binding. The crystal structure of the hinge-T mutation reveals a reorientation between the FAD-binding and capping domains that accompanies proton shuttle alteration. Taken together, hydrogen bonding from act-T to substrate may coordinate with interdomain motions to twist the double bond of fumarate and introduce the strain important for attaining the transition state.

Taken together, hydrogen bonding from act-T to substrate may coordinate with interdomain motions to twist the double bond of fumarate and introduce the strain important for attaining the transition state. Complex II superfamily members catalyze two distinct chemical reactions: the interconversion of succinate and fumarate and the interconversion of quinone and quinol (1Cecchini G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 77-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In this capacity, complex II links the citric acid cycle to the electron transfer chain. The two reactions are coupled, since electrons that are the product of one reaction are transferred through the complex II enzyme to become the reactant of the second reaction. Homologues of complex II that preferentially oxidize succinate and reduce quinone participate in aerobic respiration are known as succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (SQR 3The abbreviations used are: SQR, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; QFR, quinol:fumarate reductase; CT, charge transfer; OAA, oxaloacetate; act-T, FrdA T244A or SdhA T254A mutation; hinge-T, FrdA T234A or SdhA T244A mutation; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol; Fcc3, flavocytochrome c3. 3The abbreviations used are: SQR, succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase; QFR, quinol:fumarate reductase; CT, charge transfer; OAA, oxaloacetate; act-T, FrdA T244A or SdhA T254A mutation; hinge-T, FrdA T234A or SdhA T244A mutation; BisTris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl) propane-1,3-diol; Fcc3, flavocytochrome c3.; SdhC-DAB). By contrast, those homologues that preferentially reduce fumarate and oxidize quinol are known as quinol:fumarate reductases (QFR; FrdABCD) and participate in bacterial anaerobic respiration with fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. Complex II enzymes contain four polypeptide chains, two of which, the flavoprotein (FrdA; SdhA) and the iron protein (FrdB; SdhB), are soluble subunits and two of which span the membrane (FrdCD; SdhCD) (2Iverson T.M. Luna-Chavez C. Schröder I. Cecchini G. Rees D.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Succinate and fumarate interconversion occurs in the flavoprotein, whereas quinol and quinone interconversion occurs in the membrane-spanning region of the protein. In addition to the integral-membrane complex II homologues, there are known soluble homologues of the flavoprotein that only catalyze dicarboxylate oxidoreduction without coupling this reaction to quinone chemistry within the membrane. Both the soluble and integral membrane homologues of complex II contain an FAD prosthetic group in the flavoprotein that performs hydride transfer during catalysis. In the membrane-bound forms of complex II, covalent binding of FAD raises its potential (Em7 =∼-55 to -70 mV) and allows membrane-bound enzymes to proficiently oxidize succinate as well as reduce fumarate (3Ohnishi T.

In general, the majority of structures with ligand bound into the active site are in closed or intermediate positions that are nearly closed. The flavoproteins of both the Wolinella succinogenes QFR (20Madej M.G. Nasiri H.R. Hilgendorff N.S. Schwalbe H. Lancaster C.R.D.

The physiological significance of interdomain flexibility in the complex II superfamily is debated (24Rothery E.L. Mowat C.G. Miles C.S. Mott S. Walkinshaw M.D. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4983-4989Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and there is currently no known correlation between domain rotations and the catalysis. However, this type of interdomain movement has been suggested to control substrate access to the active site in a number of other flavoenzymes (25Mattevi A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 276-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the interdomain hinge between the FAD-binding and capping domains contains an absolutely conserved His-Pro-Thr motif that begins in an 11-amino acid loop (Fig. 2A) containing residues important for catalysis in QFR and SQR (Fig. 1B). This active site loop begins at the hinge with a threonine (Thr-A234 in the E. coli QFR, Thr-A244 in the E. coli SQR) denoted as the hinge-T. The loop ends at a second threonine (Thr-A244 in E. coli QFR, Thr-A254 in the E. coli SQR) that forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction to the substrate in the active site and is denoted as act-T. The act-T hydrogen bond to substrate is particularly notable, since it may prime fumarate to accept hydride transfer from FAD, the first step in fumarate reduction by QFR. In solution, fumarate is a planar molecule constrained by a double bond (12Reid G.A. Miles C.S. Moysey R.K. Pankhurst K.L. Chapman S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, in complex II co-structures with fumarate, the O1 and O2 oxygen atoms are out of plane with the rest of the molecule (11Leys D. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20Madej M.G. Nasiri H.R. Hilgendorff N.S. Schwalbe H. Lancaster C.R.D. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 4963-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The strain across the double bond of fumarate may facilitate hydride transfer from flavin N5 to fumarate C2 by stabilizing the transition state and lowering the transition state barrier (11Leys D. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Meyer T.E. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 1113-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 12Reid G.A. Miles C.S. Moysey R.K. Pankhurst K.L. Chapman S.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The second step of fumarate reduction in QFR, protonation of the intermediate carbanion, may be influenced by hinge-T (QFR Thr-A234), located at the end of the interdomain hinge and the beginning of the active site loop. The hinge-T side chain Oγ forms a hydrogen-bonding interaction with the side chain guanidino Nζ atom of Arg 248, which is a part of the proton shuttle that delivers a proton to the buried active site. This proton shuttle begins with Arg-A248, extends through Glu-A245, and ends with Arg-A287, which directly interacts with substrate (12Reid G.A. Miles C.S. Moysey R.K. Pankhurst K.L. Chapman S.K.

In theory, the hydrogen-bonding interaction between the hinge-T Oγ and Arg-248 Nζ should lower the pKa of the arginine side chain and allow proton transfer at physiological pH values. To further investigate the unique role of the active site loop in catalysis, the function of act-T (QFR Thr-A244; SQR Thr-A254) and hinge-T (QFR Thr-A234; SQR Thr-A244) was examined using alanine mutations in the E. coli QFR and SQR enzymes. Both mutants showed a loss of substrate binding and a loss of catalysis. Since the hinge-T does not interact directly with substrate, the basis for the loss of substrate binding in the hinge-T mutant QFR was evaluated using x-ray crystallography, which revealed that the absence of interpretable density for bound dicarboxylate resulted from a domain reorientation. The role of the hydrogen bonds provided by act-T and hinge-T are discussed for QFR and SQR, respectively. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain DW35 (ΔfrdABCD, sdhC::kan), which was used as the host for expression of wild type and mutant forms of QFR and SQR, has been previously described (30Westenberg D.J.

Mutagenesis—Mutation of individual amino acids was accomplished using the QuikChange (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) site-directed mutagenesis kit. All mutations were verified by sequencing the HindIII-BstXI restriction fragment for SdhA mutations or the BstEII-ApaI fragment from FrdA. Mutagenized fragments were subcloned back into pFAS for SQR mutants or pH3 for QFR mutants. All cloning procedures were performed in accordance with methods previously described (4Blaut M.

Measurement of Enzyme Activity—To activate the enzymes, QFR and SQR were diluted to 5 mg of protein/ml in 30 mm BTP (BisTris-propane, pH 7.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Anapoe® C12E9 (Anatrace, Maumee, OH), 3 mm malonate and incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. For spectroscopic analysis, the enzymes were then concentrated with a Centriprep YM30 (Millipore) centrifugal filter device following the manufacturerŉs instructions and then passed through a PD-10 gel filtration column to remove malonate. Activated enzyme was then stored on ice for the duration of the experiment. The standard assay medium at 30 °C contained 50 mm BTP, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.006% C12E9 with the pH adjusted to intervals of 6.0-9.4 as appropriate. Potassium ferricyanide and phenazine ethosulfate/2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol were used as electron acceptors for reactions of succinate oxidation for QFR and SQR, respectively (35Maklashina E.

https://openalex.org/W2000263416,"Protein kinase Cδ (PKCδ) activation is generally attributed to lipid cofactor-dependent allosteric activation mechanisms at membranes. However, recent studies indicate that PKCδ also is dynamically regulated through tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2- and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-treated cardiomyocytes. H2O2 activates Src and related Src-family kinases (SFKs), which function as dual PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 kinases in vitro and contribute to H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311/Tyr332 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes and in mouse embryo fibroblasts. H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311/Tyr332 phosphorylation is defective in SYF cells (deficient in SFKs) and restored by Src re-expression. PMA also promotes PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation, but this is not associated with SFK activation or PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation. Rather, PMA increases PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation by delivering PKCδ to SFK-enriched caveolae. Cyclodextrin treatment disrupts caveolae and blocks PMA-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation, without blocking H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation. The enzyme that acts as a PKCδ-Tyr311 kinase without increasing PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr332 in PMA-treated cardiomyocytes is uncertain. Although in vitro kinase assays implicate c-Abl as a selective PKCδ-Tyr311 kinase, PMA-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation persists in cardiomyocytes treated with the c-Abl inhibitor ST1571 and c-Abl is not detected in caveolae; these results effectively exclude a c-Abl-dependent process. Finally, we show that 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol mimics the effect of PMA to drive PKCδ to caveolae and increase PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation, whereas G protein-coupled receptor agonists such as norepinephrine and endothelin-1 do not. These results suggest that norepinephrine and endothelin-1 increase 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol accumulation and activate PKCδ exclusively in non-caveolae membranes. Collectively, these results identify stimulus-specific PKCδ localization and tyrosine phosphorylation mechanisms that could be targeted for therapeutic advantage.

Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Traditional models of PKCδ activation have focused on lipid cofactor-dependent mechanisms that localize PKCδ in its active conformation to membranes. However, recent studies identify regulatory phosphorylation at Thr505 in the “activation loop” segment (a region flanked by the highly conserved DFG and APE sequences) as an additional mechanism that contributes to the dynamic control of PKCδ activity in some cellular contexts. Although activation loop phosphorylation is a stable modification that plays a critical role to structure other PKC isoforms in a favorable conformation for catalysis, PKCδ is catalytically active even without activation loop Thr505 phosphorylation. Rather, PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation plays a unique role as a dynamically regulated process that is increased by PMA and certain agonist-activated receptors and contributes to the control of PKCδ activity and/or substrate specificity (1Steinberg S.F.

PKCδ also is phosphorylated at Tyr311 and Tyr332, two tyrosine residues that are unique to the hinge region of PKCδ (and not conserved in other PKC isoforms). Our recent studies focused on mechanisms that regulate PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation, showing that oxidative stress resulting from H2O2 treatment leads to the release of PKCδ from membranes and a global increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation in both soluble and particulate subcellular compartments. H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is via a PP1-sensitive mechanism; this is presumed to reflect a role for Src or a related PP1-sensitive Src family kinase (SFK), because these enzymes are activated in H2O2-treated cardiomyocytes. PMA also increases PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation via a PP1-sensitive pathway. However, PMA-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is via a different signaling pathway that is confined to the membrane fraction and is not associated with a global increase in SFK activity. In vitro studies suggest that PMA increases PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation by inducing a conformational change that renders PKCδ a better substrate for phosphorylation by Src (7Rybin V.O. Guo J.

Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). According to this formulation, PMA promotes PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation by delivering the enzyme in an active conformation to a Src-enriched membrane fraction. Because caveolae have been identified as signaling domains for SFKs in other cell types, and our previous studies demonstrated that PMA delivers PKCδ to the caveolae compartment (9Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), this study examines the role of caveolae as platforms for cross-talk between PKCδ and SFKs in cardiomyocytes. Insofar as PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is predicted to be associated with a coordinate increase in PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr332 (a site that also is a target for in vitro Src-dependent phosphorylation (7Rybin V.O.

Chem. 2007; 282: 23631-23638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)), and PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation may impart functionally important properties (as a consensus binding sequence for the SH2 domain of the adapter protein Shc (10Leitges M.

Brodie C. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2165-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar)), the mechanisms that regulate PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation also were examined.

All other chemicals were reagent grade. Cell Culture—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from the hearts of 2-day-old Wistar rats by a trypsin dispersion procedure using a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiomyocytes followed by irradiation as described previously (2Rybin V.O.

Cells were plated on protamine sulfate-coated culture dishes at a density of 5 × 106 cells/100-mm dish. Experiments were performed on cultures grown for 5 days in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and then serum deprived for the subsequent 24 h. SYF and Src+ cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 100 μg/ml hygromycin at 37 °C, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Preparation of Soluble and Particulate or Detergent-insoluble Fractions—Soluble and particulate fractions were prepared according to methods published previously (7Rybin V.O. Guo J. Gertsberg Z. Elouardighi H. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23631-23638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then transferred to ice-cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μg/ml aprotinin, 48 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μm pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 50 mm sodium fluoride), lysed by sonication, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction and the particulate fraction was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Some studies used a different biochemical fractionation method to prepare soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions. Briefly, after washing with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were solubilized in detergent-containing lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS), sonicated, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was saved as the soluble fraction and the detergent-insoluble fraction was solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Preparation of Caveolae Membranes—Fractions enriched in the muscle-specific caveolin-3 isoform were prepared according to a detergent-free purification scheme described previously (9Rybin V.O. Xu X. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 14Rybin V.O. Xu X. Lisanti M.P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41447-41457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, cells from five 100-mm diameter dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 0.5 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.0 (0.5 ml/dish). Cells from five dishes were combined (total volume, 2.5 ml) for each preparation. The extract was sequentially disrupted by homogenization with a loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer (10 strokes), a Polytron tissue grinder (three 10-s bursts), and a tip sonicator (three 20-s bursts). The homogenate was then adjusted to 40% sucrose by adding an equal volume of 80% sucrose prepared in MES-buffered saline (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, and 0.15 m NaCl), placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, overlaid with a 5–30% discontinuous sucrose gradient (3 ml of 5% sucrose and 4 ml of 35% sucrose, both in MES-buffered saline containing 0.25 m sodium carbonate), and centrifuged at 260,000 × g for 16 to 18 h in a SW40 rotor (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA). After centrifugation, 13 1-ml fractions were collected. A pooled caveolae fraction (fractions 4–5, containing all of the buoyant caveolin-3 immunoreactivity and 0.5–1% total starting cell protein), a pooled fraction 8–13 (F8–13, which contains the bulk of the cellular material including the cytosol and most of the particulate membrane fraction), and the insoluble pellet (P, which is solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The caveolin-3-enriched membrane fraction isolated according to this method is biochemically distinct from the surrounding phospholipid bilayer and is operationally defined as caveolae in this study. However, it is important to note that this buoyant membrane fraction undoubtedly contains both true caveolae (specialized lipid raft membranes that contain caveolin and form invaginations at, or vesicles close to, the surface membrane) and morphologically featureless lipid rafts (that coexist and may even associate with caveolae (15Oh P. Schnitzer J.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 685-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar)). Biochemical methods to separate these distinct membrane subdomains and experiments to resolve their discrete cellular functions are beyond the scope of this study. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analysis—Immunoblotting on lysates or immunoprecipitated PKCδ was according to methods described previously or the manufacturer's instructions (2Rybin V.O. Sabri A.

Res. 1999; 84: 980-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). All anti-PKC antibodies (including the phosphosite specific antibodies (PSSAs) that specifically recognize PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505, Tyr311, and Tyr332) have been validated (2Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Of note, the PKCδ-Tyr(P)311 antibody is a highly specific reagent that can be used to track PKCδ phosphorylation (at endogenous levels of enzyme expression) in experiments on cell lysates. The anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)332 antibody is less specific and requires immunoprecipitation for studies of endogenous PKCδ phosphorylation. In each figure, each panel represents the results from a single gel (exposed for a uniform duration); detection was with enhanced chemiluminescence. In Vitro PKCδ Phosphorylation by Src and Other Tyrosine Kinases—0.03 μg of recombinant human PKCδ (rPKCδ) was preincubated in the absence or presence of Src kinase (0.18 units) in 110 μl of a reaction buffer containing 43 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5.45 mm MgCl2, 0.75 mm EDTA, 0.77 mm EGTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 125 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.006% Brij-35, 0.04 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm benzamidine, and [γ-32P]ATP (13 μCi, 83 μm). Incubations were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in the absence or presence of 91 μg/ml phosphatidylserine (PS) alone or with PMA (175 nm), DAG (7.2 μm), or diC8 (7.2 μm) and were stopped by adding 37 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted for PKCδ protein and phosphorylation. For peptide mapping studies, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the band corresponding to PKCδ was excised from the membrane, cut into small pieces, and treated for 30 min at 37 °C with polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.5%, w/v) in acetic acid (100 mm), followed by 5 water washes (to remove the acid) and a 10-min incubation at room temperature in the dark with 100 mm iodoacetate to carboxymethylate PKCδ. Membrane pieces were then washed three times with water and twice with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and incubated overnight at 37 °C in 60 μl of a buffer containing 42 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 17 μm HCl, and 10 μg of sequencing grade trypsin. Digested peptides were eluted from the membrane by sonication, lyophilized, and the residue was reconstituted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and fractionated by RP-HPLC on a Vydac semimicro C18 column (2.1 × 250 mm). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile over 140 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluant was monitored at 220 nm and fractions were collected every 30 s for Cherenkov counting. Radioactive peptides of interest were submitted to the Howard Hughes Medical Institute/Columbia University Protein Chemistry Core Facility for sequencing by MALDI-MS. Distinct Agonist-dependent PKCδ Phosphorylation Patterns in Cardiomyocytes—We previously reported that treatment with PMA, the α1-adrenergic receptor (α1-AR) agonist norepinephrine (NE), and H2O2 results in distinct PKCδ phosphorylation patterns in cardiomyocytes. Fig. 1 extends these studies to examine PKCδ regulation by endothelin-1 (ET-1) and PDGF. Fig. 1A shows that PKCδ is recovered from resting cardiomyocytes with little-to-no Thr505 or Tyr311 phosphorylation. NE and ET-1 increase PKCδ phosphorylation at Thr505. In each case, PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is maximal at 5 min (the first time point sampled in the experiments) and sustained for at least another 10 min of continuous stimulation (Fig. 1B). NE- and ET-1-dependent increases in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation are similar in magnitude, and comparable with the stimulatory effect of PMA (Fig. 1, A and C). We previously reported that PMA induces a rapid and sustained increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation that falls only as PKCδ protein abundance decreases due to down-regulation during chronic stimulation (2Rybin V.O. Sabri A. Short J. Braz J.C. Molkentin J.D. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14555-14564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows that the NE-dependent increase in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation also is sustained for at least 60 min, whereas the ET-1 response wanes with stimulation intervals greater than 30 min. PDGF also increases PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation, but this response is quite modest in magnitude when compared with the considerably more robust increases in PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation induced by NE, ET-1, or PMA. PDGF-dependent PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation is detected at 5 min and wanes as the stimulation interval is prolonged to >30 min (Fig. 1, B and C). PDGF increases PKCδ phosphorylation at Tyr311, whereas NE and ET-1 treatments for 5 min (Fig. 1A) or selected time points up to 60 min of incubation (Ref. 8Rybin V.O. Guo J. Sabri A. Elouardighi H. Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar and data not shown) do not lead to a detectable increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation. The magnitude of the PDGF-dependent increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is comparable with the stimulatory effect of PMA (Fig. 1, A and C). However, PDGF and PMA responses are not necessarily mediated by the identical signaling mechanism. Using an anti-Src-Tyr(P)416 PSSA that selectively recognizes the activation loop phosphorylated/activated forms of Src and related SFKs, Fig. 1B shows that PDGF induces a modest increase in Src activity. In contrast, PMA promotes PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation without increasing Src-Tyr416 phosphorylation (Fig. 1B and Ref. 8Rybin V.O. Guo J. Sabri A. Elouardighi H. Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Finally, Fig. 1B shows that H2O2 induces a robust increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation (to a level that exceeds PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation in PDGF- or PMA-treated cardiomyocytes) and that the H2O2 response is associated with a massive increase in Src-Tyr416 phosphorylation. PKCδ partitions between the soluble and particulate fractions of resting cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1D). PMA, NE, and ET-1 translocate PKCδ protein from the soluble to the particulate fraction and increase PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation exclusively in the particulate fraction (Fig. 1D and data not shown). The PMA-dependent increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation also is detected exclusively in the particulate fraction. In contrast, treatment with H2O2 (which does not translocate PKCδ to the particulate fraction, but rather releases PKCδ from the particulate fraction) leads to an increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation in both the soluble and particulate fractions. Fig. 1D also shows that H2O2 does not increase PKCδ-Thr505 phosphorylation and NE does not increase PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation. Tyr332 has been identified as another major phosphorylation site on heterologously overexpressed PKCδ in H2O2-treated COS-7 cells (16Konishi H. Yamauchi E. Taniguchi H. Yamamoto T. Matsuzaki H. Takemura Y. Ohmae K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6587-6592Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because preliminary studies demonstrated that the anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)332 antibody used in our studies is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to be used directly in immunoblotting studies on cell lysates, PKCδ was immunoprecipitated from resting and agonist-treated cardiomyocyte cultures followed by immunoblot analysis with anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)332, anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)311, a general anti-Tyr(P) antibody (to track total PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation), and an anti-PKCδ protein antibody (to validate equal protein recovery and loading). Fig. 2A shows that high concentrations of H2O2 promote PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation in association with an increase in Src-Tyr(P)416 SFKs or increasing PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation; NE does not increase Src phosphorylation at Tyr416 or PKCδ phosphorylation at either tyrosine residue. We previously used an immunoprecipitation strategy with antibodies that discriminate individual SFKs (Src, Lyn, and Fyn) followed by immunoblotting with the anti-Src-Tyr(P)416 PSSA to compare the time course for Src activation and PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation. These previous studies established that Src activation precedes PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation; H2O2 induces a similar rapid and robust increase in Src, Lyn, and Fyn activity that is maximal by 2 min, whereas the H2O2-dependent increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is detectable at 2 min and increases further as the incubation interval is prolonged to 5–30 min (8Rybin V.O. Guo J. Sabri A. Elouardighi H. Schaefer E. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19350-19361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B uses a similar strategy to compare the H2O2 requirements for SFK activation and PKCδ-Tyr311/Tyr332 phosphorylation. These studies show that high H2O2 concentrations (5 mm, a level of oxidative stress that typically leads to cellular necrosis) activate Src, Lyn, and Fyn, whereas lower H2O2 concentrations (0.1–1 mm) do not detectably increase Src, Lyn, or Fyn activity (although control experiments show that 0.1–1 mm H2O2 activates ERK and previous literature links low H2O2 concentrations to changes in gene expression, cardioprotection, and at least some features of the cardiac hypertrophic response (17Kemp T.J. Causton H.C. Clerk A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 307: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 18Kwon S.H. Pimentel D.R. Remondino A. Sawyer D.B. Colucci W.S. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2003; 35: 615-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)). The steep concentration-response curves for H2O2-dependent SFK activation identified in these experiments suggest an amplification mechanism. The results could reflect oxidative-inactivation of an antioxidant enzyme or an H2O2 response localized to mitochondria (where oxidative stress responses are amplified as a result of ROS-induced ROS release once H2O2 exceeds a threshold concentration (19Georgiou G. Masip L. Science. 2003; 300: 592-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 20Zorov D.B. Juhaszova M. Sollott S.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar)). Finally, we used a pharmacologic approach as an initial strategy to identify the kinase pathway(s) that promote PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation. Fig. 2, A and C, show that agonist-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 (and Src-Tyr416) phosphorylation are fully abrogated by PP1. Although a recent study attributed H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr332 phosphorylation to the epidermal growth factor receptor (which is recovered in a multiprotein complex with PKCδ from H2O2-treated COS-7 cells (21Morita M. Matsuzaki H. Yamamoto T. Fukami Y. Kikkawa U. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2008; 143: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)), agonist-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation is preserved in cardiomyocytes treated with AG1478 (an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, Fig. 2C); control experiments validate the efficacy of AG1478 treatment showing that AG1478 abrogates epidermal growth factor-dependent activation of ERK (Fig. 2C). Agonist-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation is also preserved in cardiomyocytes treated with GF109203X (a general PKC inhibitor) or PP3 (a structurally similar, but functionally inactive, PP1 analogue that serves as a negative control; Fig. 2A and data not shown). These results implicate Src or a related PP1-sensitive SFK in the PKCδ-Tyr311 and -Tyr332 phosphorylation pathway in cardiomyocytes. This conclusion gains further support from studies in SYF cells (that lack the major SFKs, Src, Yes, and Fyn) and Src+ cells (SYF cells engineered to re-express Src). In SYF cells, a high concentration of H2O2 leads to a robust increase in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation (identified with anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)332 antibodies in PKCδ pull-downs (Fig. 3A) and with anti-PKCδ-Tyr(P)311 in cell lysates (Fig. 3B)); PMA also induces a modest increase in PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation in Src+ cells (Fig. 3B). In contrast, H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is detected only at very low levels, and PMA-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphorylation is not detected in SYF cells. Control experiments establish that the defect in PKCδ tyrosine phosphorylation in H2O2-treated SYF cells is not due to a generalized defect in H2O2-dependent responses, because H2O2-dependent activation of ERK is similar in SYF and Src+ cells. The observation that SYF cells support a low level of H2O2-dependent PKCδ-Tyr311 phosphory"
https://openalex.org/W1989076356,"Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of hepatic bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol. During fasting and in type I diabetes, elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) induce expression of the Cyp7A1 gene and overexpression of PGC-1α in hepatoma cells stimulates bile acid synthesis. Using Ad-PGC-1α-RNA interference to induce acute disruption of PGC-1α in mice, here we show that PGC-1α is necessary for fasting-mediated induction of CYP7A1. Co-immunoprecipitation and promoter activation studies reveal that the induction of CYP7A1 is mediated by direct interaction between PGC-1α and the AF2 domain of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). In contrast, the very similar PGC-1β could not substitute for PGC-1α. We also show that transactivation of PGC-1α and LRH-1 is repressed by the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Treatment of mice with GW4064, a synthetic agonist for farnesoid X receptor, induced SHP expression and decreased both the recruitment of PGC-1α to the Cyp7A1 promoter and the fasting-induced expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. These data suggest that PGC-1α is an important co-activator for LRH-1 and that SHP targets the interaction between LRH-1 and PGC-1α to inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Overall, these studies provide further evidence for the important role of PGC-1α in bile acid homeostasis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of farnesoid X receptor in vivo can be used to reverse the increase in CYP7A1 associated with adverse metabolic conditions. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the classic pathway of hepatic bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol. During fasting and in type I diabetes, elevated levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) induce expression of the Cyp7A1 gene and overexpression of PGC-1α in hepatoma cells stimulates bile acid synthesis. Using Ad-PGC-1α-RNA interference to induce acute disruption of PGC-1α in mice, here we show that PGC-1α is necessary for fasting-mediated induction of CYP7A1. Co-immunoprecipitation and promoter activation studies reveal that the induction of CYP7A1 is mediated by direct interaction between PGC-1α and the AF2 domain of liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1). In contrast, the very similar PGC-1β could not substitute for PGC-1α. We also show that transactivation of PGC-1α and LRH-1 is repressed by the small heterodimer partner (SHP). Treatment of mice with GW4064, a synthetic agonist for farnesoid X receptor, induced SHP expression and decreased both the recruitment of PGC-1α to the Cyp7A1 promoter and the fasting-induced expression of CYP7A1 mRNA. These data suggest that PGC-1α is an important co-activator for LRH-1 and that SHP targets the interaction between LRH-1 and PGC-1α to inhibit CYP7A1 expression. Overall, these studies provide further evidence for the important role of PGC-1α in bile acid homeostasis and suggest that pharmacological targeting of farnesoid X receptor in vivo can be used to reverse the increase in CYP7A1 associated with adverse metabolic conditions. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol in the mammalian liver and secreted into the gall bladder where they are stored along with phospholipids and cholesterol. In response to food intake, chemosensory cells of the gastrointestinal track release cholecystokinin, which stimulates gall bladder contraction releasing bile contents into the small intestine to facilitate digestion and absorption of dietary lipids and fat-soluble vitamins. Under normal conditions, 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed through the distal intestine and returned to the liver and the remaining 5% are excreted into the feces along with excess cholesterol. Thus, bile acids play a crucial role in regulating mammalian cholesterol and general lipid homeostasis (1Chiang J.Y. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 443-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 2Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The first and rate-controlling step in the classic pathway for cholesterol conversion to bile acids is catalyzed by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). 2The abbreviations used are: CYP7A1, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase; FXR, farnesoid X receptor; LRH-1, liver receptor homologue 1; SHP, small heterodimer partner; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1; HNF-4, hepatic nuclear factor-4; FGF, fibroblast growth factor; STZ, streptozotocin; PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CYP8B1, cholesterol 12α-hydroxylase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; ERRE, estrogen receptor-related receptor responsive element; RNAi, RNA interference; CMV, cytomegalovirus; WT, wild type; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; LXR, liver X receptor. The activity of CYP7A1 is primarily controlled at the transcriptional level, as the gene is subject to regulation in response to a plethora of hormonal and dietary signals (3Jelinek D.F. Andersson S.

Most directly, bile acids themselves have been extensively studied as signaling molecules that regulate Cyp7A1 gene expression and provide a classic negative feedback system of control (2Russell D.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 137-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). The feedback mechanism is composed of several overlapping molecular pathways one of which is initiated through bile acids acting as ligand agonists for the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) (9Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar). Ligand-activated FXR directly binds to the promoter of the small heterodimer partner (Shp) gene and induces expression of the SHP mRNA (10Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

The SHP protein is an unusual member of the nuclear receptor family because it does not bind DNA directly but rather functions to curtail gene activation mediated by a subset of other DNA binding nuclear receptors through direct protein-protein interactions (12Seol W. Choi H.-S. Moore D.D. Science. 1996; 272: 1336-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The DNA binding monomeric LRH-1 nuclear receptor is the most widely recognized target of SHP repression and LRH-1 stimulation of Cyp7A1 gene expression was the first identified target for SHP in bile acid-dependent feedback regulation (10Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Price R.R. Watson M.A. McKee D.D. Moore L.B. Galardi C. Wilson J.G. Lewis M.C. Roth M.E. Maloney P.R. Willson T.M. Kliewer S.A. Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30708-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and can be a direct target for SHP repression as well (15Lee Y.-K. Dowhan D.H. Hadzopoulou-Cladaras M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). However, peptide binding and structural studies reveal there is a significant preference for SHP interacting with LRH-1 over HNF-4 and other nuclear receptors (16Li Y. Choi M. Suino K. Kovach A. Daugherty J. Kliewer S.A. Xu H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9505-9510Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In mice that overexpress SHP constitutively in the liver, CYP7A1 levels are repressed and both LRH-1 and SHP interact with the endogenous Cyp7A1 gene as shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (17Boulias K. Katrakili N. Bamberg K. Underhill P. Greenfield A. Talianidis I. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2624-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a complementary regulatory process, bile acids induce activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) (18Gupta S. Stravitz R.T. Dent P. Hylemon P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15816-15822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), which also plays an important role in inhibition of Cyp7A1 gene expression. Additional studies suggest that bile acids modulate other intracellular signaling systems, such as protein kinase C (19Stravitz R.T. Rao Y.P. Vlahcevic Z.R. Gurley E.C. Jarvis W.D. Hylemon P.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G293-G303PubMed Google Scholar), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (20Qiao D. Chen W. Stratagoules E.D. Martinez J.D. J. Biol.

Hylemon P.B. Dent P. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, how these additional pathways directly impact CYP7A1 gene expression has not been fully revealed. More recent studies have demonstrated that bile acids also induce expression of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes (22Holt J.A. Luo G. Billin A.N. Bisi J. McNeill Y.Y. Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M. Wang D.Y. Mansfield T.A. Kliewer S.A. Goodwin B. Jones S.A. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1581-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) or the mouse orthologue FGF15 in the mouse intestine through an FXR-dependent process (23Inagaki T. Choi M. Moschetta A. Peng L. Cummins C.L. McDonald J.G. Luo G. Jones S.A. Goodwin B. Richardson J.A. Gerard R.D. Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Kliewer S.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). The secreted FGF 19/15 in turn signals through FGFR4 in the liver to inhibit expression of the hepatic CYP7A1 gene. PGC-1α was originally identified as a transcriptional co-activator that was induced in brown adipose tissue in response to hypothermic stress (24Puigserver P. Wu Z. Park C.W. Graves R. Wright M. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1998; 92: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3102) Google Scholar). PGC-1α is also induced in liver by fasting and diabetes where it regulates several hepatic gluconeogenic genes acting as a transcriptional co-activator for DNA binding nuclear receptor family members (25Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H. Accili D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar, 26Yoon J.C.

In our previous studies, we showed that CYP7A1 was induced during fasting and by streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes and that a recombinant adenovirus expressing PGC-1α-induced Cyp7A1 gene expression and bile acid biosynthesis in HepG2 cells (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In the current studies, we have extended these earlier observations to show directly that the fasting induced expression of CYP7A1 is attenuated by an RNAi targeted to PGC-1α. We also show that full-length LRH-1 is a direct target for co-activation by PGC-1α, and that a functional interaction between LRH-1 and PGC-1α is inhibited by SHP in both co-transfection studies in cultured cells and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays from mouse liver. Based on these observations we reasoned that a targeted increase of SHP in animals would prevent the fasting and diabetes-dependent induction of CYP7A1. Consistent with this prediction, we also show that treating animals with the FXR synthetic agonist GW4064 to induce SHP expression also prevented the induction of CYP7A1 associated with fasting and diabetes. These results document the effectiveness of pharmacologically targeting FXR and SHP to limit the increased Cyp7A1 gene expression during stressful and pathological metabolic conditions. Plasmids—3x(LRH-1)pSynTATA-Luc was generated by inserting synthetic oligonucleotides containing three copies of the LRH-1 binding site, TCAAGGCCA, of the human CYP7A1 promoter into the SstI and NheI sites, immediately followed by TATA of the pSynTATA-Luc (27Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The SstI and NheI sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotides, respectively, for cloning purposes. ERRE-Luc and pcDNA3.1-PGC-1β were generously provided by Dr. B. Blumberg (University of California, Irvine) and Dr. B. Spiegelman (Harvard Medical School), respectively. pGL3R7α-342 and 3X(LXRE) were gifts from Dr. G. Gil (Virginia Commonwealth University) and Dr. Darryl Granner (Vanderbilt University). CMV-based expression constructs for SRC-1 and CBP were obtained from Dr. Chris Glass (University of California, San Diego). pGEX-4T1.PGC-1α was constructed by PCR-based amplification of full-length PGC-1α using the following primers: forward primer, 5′-ATGGCTTGGGACATGTGCAGCCAAGAC-3′; reverse primer, 5′-TTACCTGCGCAAGCTTCTCTGAGC-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and NotI and inserted into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of the multiple cloning site of pGEX-4T1. pcDNA3.1.PGC-1α was a gift from Dr. D. Kelly (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). pcDNA3.1.LRH-1/WT and pcDNA3.1.LRH-1/AF2 were described previously (28Datta S. Wang L. Moore D.D. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 807-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). CMV-SHP was a gift from Dr. D. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection Assay—293T cells were maintained in Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transient transfection was performed by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method, as described previously (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well dishes at a density of 3.5 × 105 cells/well 1 day before transfection. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 2 μg/well of the indicated luciferase-reporter, 1 μg/well of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency, and the indicated amount of expression vectors as described in the figure legends. Equal amounts of DNA were used for all transfection reactions by adding empty vector DNA. After 16 h, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh medium, and cultured for an additional 24 h before harvest. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays and normalization were described previously (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Values represent the mean of duplicates ± S.D. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. Animal Treatments—Four-week-old B6129 male mice were obtained from Taconic and maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. The mice were allowed to adapt to new environments for at least 1 week before experiments. At 8 weeks of age, mice were administered GW4064 (30 mg/kg body weight) by oral gavage twice a day and sacrificed in the following morning, 8 h after the second treatment. Streptozotocin (STZ) was injected into mice as described previously (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) to induce type I diabetes. Replication defective recombinant adenoviruses, PGC-1α RNAi or a control nonspecific RNAi (gifts from Dr. M. Montminy, Salk Institute), were propagated in 293 cells and purified by CsCl gradient centrifugation. A total of 1 × 109 plaque-forming units of each adenovirus was administered into mice by intravenous injection. 7 days after adenovirus infections, mice were sacrificed for RNA analysis. For fasting experiments, mice were fasted for 24 h, as described previously (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All mice were sacrificed between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Livers were removed and ∼20% was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until RNA was isolated. The remaining 80% was used directly for chromatin isolation as described below for the chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RNA Isolation and Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerŉs instructions. 20 μg of total RNA was subjected to Northern analysis or qPCR analyses, as described (6Shin D.J. Plateroti M. Samarut J. Osborne T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3853-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). An 80-base HindIII/EcoRI fragment of rat ribosomal protein L32 cDNA was used as a control to normalize the total amount of RNA per lane. Other cDNA probes used were also described previously (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Mouse livers were harvested, minced with a razor blade, and cross-linked for 10 min with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. The cross-linking was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Samples were centrifuged and supernatants were removed. Cell pellets were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer with a B pestle in buffer (5 mm Pipes, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors) to release nuclei. Cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 2 m sucrose, 10% glycerol, 0.15 mm spermine, and protease inhibitors). The homogenates were layered over buffer A and centrifuged at 26,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Nuclear pellets were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and protease inhibitors) and sonicated to reduce the size of chromatin to ∼500 bases in length. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated with an anti-PGC-1α (Santa Cruz sc-H13067) and analyzed as described previously (6Shin D.J. Plateroti M. Samarut J. Osborne T.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 3853-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for quantitative PCR: Cyp7A1, forward, 5′-TGGAAAGCTTCTGCCTGTTT-3′ and reverse, 5′-CGAAGGTCTGTCCCTCATGT-3′; Fgf15, forward, 5′-TCCCAGTCTGTGTCAGATGAAGATC-3′ and reverse, 5′-TTCGTTTTGGTCCTCCTCGCAG-3′; Pepck, forward, 5′-GTGGGAGTGACACCTCACAGC 3′ and reverse, 5′-AGGGCAGGCCTAGCCGAGACG-3′. Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—293T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/dish the day before transfection. After an overnight incubation, cells were transfected with the indicated vectors for 16 h. The next day, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, refed with fresh normal medium, and cultured for an additional 48 h. Cells were harvested in cell lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) and placed on ice for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After preclearing cell lysates with protein A beads at 4 °C for 2 h, samples were centrifuged and supernatants were incubated with an anti-PGC-1α overnight at 4 °C. After an additional incubation of the samples with protein A beads at 4 °C for 2 h, protein A beads were washed and immune complexes were eluted by SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 8% SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting with an anti-PGC-1α or an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal (Sigma). GST-binding Assays—GST-PGC-1α fusion protein or GST protein alone was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21. Equal amounts of GST-PGC-1α or GST were bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for 2 h at 4°C, followed by extensive washes to remove unbound GST protein. Full-length and ΔAF2 LRH-1 proteins were produced and labeled with 35Sbythe TnT-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega). 35S-Labeled LRH-1/WT or LRH-1/ΔAF2 was incubated with GST-PGC-1α-bound beads for 2 h at 4 °C in HEGN buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5% nonfat dry milk, followed by three washes to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Specific protein bound to GST-PGC-1α was eluted and subject to 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Protein Isolation and Blotting—Total cell lysates from 293T cells transfected with LRH-1/WT or LRH-1/ΔAF2 were fractionated on 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and analyzed first by Ponceau S staining to confirm that equal amounts of total protein were both loaded and transferred in each lane. Then, the blot was incubated with an anti-FLAG M2 mouse monoclonal (Sigma) followed by a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Reactivity was then detected with the ECL kit (Pierce). Ad-PGC-1α RNAi Reduced Fasting-induced Cyp7A1 Gene Expression—In a previous report, we showed that PGC-1α induced Cyp7A1 gene expression in cultured cells and that CYP7A1 was co-induced with PGC-1α during fasting and streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice (29Shin D.-J. Campos J.A. Gil G. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50047-50052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To directly evaluate whether PGC-1α is necessary for fasting-induced expression of CYP7A1, we decreased PGC-1α expression in liver by delivering an adenovirus construct expressing a PGC-1α RNAi into mice by intravenous injection. CYP7A1 and PGC-1α mRNAs were induced by 10- and 3.5-fold, respectively, in response to fasting in control mice (Fig. 1). Hepatic PGC-1α mRNA levels were effectively reduced by the PGC-1α RNAi and this was accompanied by a significant blunting of the fasting induction of CYP7A1 mRNA (p < 0.05). Expression of PEPCK was also induced by fasting and PGC-1α RNAi treatment seemed to blunt the response but the effect did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.069). These data extend our previous studies and document that PGC-1α plays a key role in the induction of CYP7A1 during fasting. PGC-1β Does Not Stimulate CYP7A1 Promoter Activity—PGC-1β is very similar to PGC-1α and is involved in many of the same physiological responses (30Lin J. Handschin C. Spiegelman B.M. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 361-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1692) Google Scholar). However, there are differences in target gene and pathway specificity so we investigated whether the Cyp7A1 promoter was also activated by PGC-1β. When the two co-activators were compared only PGC-1α displayed appreciable co-activation for the Cyp7A1 promoter (Fig. 2A, left panel). Although, an estrogen receptor-related receptor responsive promoter (ERRE) was co-activated by both PGC-1 family members indicating the failure to co-activate Cyp7A1 was not simply due to inefficient expression of PGC-1β (Fig. 2A, right panel). The PGC-1α responsive region of the murine Cyp7A1 gene harbors cis acting binding sites for several transcription factors including HNF-4, LXR, and LRH-1. Although a Gal4-LRH-1 fusion protein has been shown to activate a Gal4 reporter (31Safi R. Kovacic A. Gaillard S. Murata Y. Simpson E.R. McDonnell D.P. Clyne C.D. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 11762-11770Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), PGC-1α-dependent activation by the full-length LRH-1 protein through LRH-1 binding sites has not been specifically examined. To evaluate the ability of LRH-1 to activate transcription through an LRH-1 binding site along with PGC-1α or other co-activators, we constructed a reporter plasmid that contains three copies of the LRH-1 binding site from the human CYP7A1 promoter attached to a minimal TATA box containing the luciferase reporter gene (32Dooley K.A. Bennett M.K. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5285-5291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because this reporter contains only the LRH-1 binding sites and a minimal promoter, it provides a direct readout for the transcriptional activity through LRH-1 recognition elements. As shown in Fig. 2B, addition of an LRH-1 expression construct stimulated the triple response element reporter 6-fold and inclusion of the PGC-1α expression vector greatly enhanced LRH-1-mediated transactivation. As expected, the PGC-1α construct had no activity in the absence of co-transfected LRH-1. Expression from the control promoter construct lacking the LRH-1 recognition sites was not significantly affected by either LRH-1 or PGC-1α. These results clearly indicate that PGC-1α stimulated the transcriptional potential of LRH-1 through the LRH-1 target sites in the promoter. In contrast, PGC-1β did not function as a co-activator for the LRH-1 reporter either (Fig. 2C). The AF2 Domain of LRH-1 Is Required for PGC-1α-mediated Co-Activation—Because the carboxyl-terminal AF2 domain of nuclear receptors is important for recruitment of other co-activators, we examined whether the AF2 domain of LRH-1 might be required for PGC-1α-mediated co-activation. As shown in Fig. 3, PGC-1α enhanced transcriptional activity of the WT LRH-1 construct in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no effect when included with a construct containing a deletion of the AF2 domain. Importantly, deletion of the AF-2 domain did not alter protein expression as measured by an immunoblot detecting the FLAG epitope present in both proteins (Fig. 3B, inset).FIGURE 2PGC-1α is a co-activator for LRH-1.A, HepG2 cells were co-transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters (2 μg) along with expression vectors for PGC-1α (3 μg) or PGC-1β (3 μg) as detailed in the figure. pCMV-β-galactosidase (2 μg) was added to each transfection as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Luciferase activities were measured as described under “Materials and Methods” and were corrected for β-galactosidase activity. Results are expressed as -fold change relative to those of cells transfected with luciferase reporter alone. B and C, 293T cells were co-transfected with the indicated luciferase reporters (2 μg) along with expression vectors for PGC-1α (0.5 μg), PGC-1β (0.5 μg), or LRH-1 (0.5 μg) as detailed in the figure. pCMV-β-galactosidase (1 μg) was added to each transfection as an internal control for transfection efficiency.

https://openalex.org/W2070055751,"Although large-scale approaches have identified numerous mitochondrial phosphoproteins, little is known about the mitochondrial kinases and phosphatases that regulate these phosphoproteins. Here, we identify two members of the atypical dual specificity phosphatases (DSP), DSP18 and DSP21, that are localized in mitochondria. Although DSP18 is widely expressed in several mammalian tissues, DSP21 is selectively expressed in the testes. We demonstrate that DSP18 and DSP21 are targeted to mitochondria by cryptic internal localization signals. Subfractionation of mitochondria demonstrated that DSP18 is located in the intermembrane space as a peripheral membrane protein of the inner membrane. In contrast, subfractionation of rat testis mitochondria revealed DSP21 is localized to the matrix as a peripheral membrane protein of the inner membrane. Moreover, we demonstrate that a previously reported substrate for DSP18, the stress-activated protein kinase, does not localize to mitochondria in several different tissues, making it an unlikely substrate for DSP18. Finally, we show that induction of apoptosis by treatment with staurosporine causes translocation of DSP18 from the intermembrane space into the cytosol similar to other apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c. This work rigorously demonstrates the unique location of two highly similar DSPs on opposing sides of the mitochondrial inner membrane."

Within the symbiosomes the bacteria differentiate to bacteroids, the active form that carries out nitrogen fixation. The progression from free-living bacteria to bacteroid is characterized by physiological and morphological changes at the bacterial surface, a phase shift with an altered array of cell surface glycoconjugates.

We have determined the structure of the major O-polysaccharide (OPS) isolated from free living Rhizobium leguminosarum 3841, a symbiont of Pisum sativum, using chemical methods, mass spectrometry, and NMR spectroscopy analysis. The OPS is composed of several unusual glycosyl residues, including 6-deoxy-3-O-methyl-d-talose and 2-acetamido-2deoxy-l-quinovosamine.

Rhizobium leguminosarum is a Gram-negative endosymbiont that forms a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with the legume host Pisum sativum. Like other Rhizobiaceae, it is a member of the α-2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria, which includes the phytopathogen Agrobacterium and phylogenetically related bacteria such as the intracellular animal pathogens Bartonella and Brucella (1Bhat U.R.

A significant feature shared by members of this subgroup is the ability to survive intracellularly within the eukaryotic host, often surrounded by host membrane-derived compartments, which in the case of rhizobia are termed symbiosomes. Although the early stages of symbiotic infection have been studied, factors enabling rhizobia to survive within the host cell environment throughout their life cycle are poorly understood (2Kannenberg, E.

This is due in part to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of purified bacteroid mass to allow structural study of components. A model for symbiotic infection begins with a mutual exchange of signal molecules, including inter alia plant flavonoids and bacterial lipochitooligosaccharides, leading to bacterial adhesion to root hairs and the induction of unique plant-derived structures, e.g. root nodules, infection threads, and symbiosomes (2Kannenberg, E. L., Reuhs, B. L., Forsberg, L. S., and Carlson, R. W. (1998) in The Rhizobiaceae (Spaink, H. P., Kondorosi, A., and Hooykaas, P. J.

Rhizobia migrate through the infection threads and are internalized into the root cortical cells through a process resembling endocytosis. Internalization yields symbiosomes, specialized intracellular compartments composed of a plant-derived membrane that closely surrounds the bacterium. Within the symbiosomes the rhizobia differentiate into bacteroids, the active form that reduces atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia. In the case of R. leguminosarum, histochemical and electron micrograph studies have shown that the rhizobial surface is in close proximity to the surrounding plant-derived symbiosome membrane and that contact points appear to exist between the two (2Kannenberg, E.

Compositional and immunological studies have shown that in R. leguminosarum and the closely related Rhizobium etli, LPS/O-antigen epitope expression is modified by environmental factors, including growth at acidic pH or low oxygen concentration, conditions thought to mimic those within the nodule (17Bhat U.R.

In the majority of cases the epitope structures have not been characterized, and it has been difficult to draw precise conclusions about the significance of structural alterations with regard to nodulation efficiency or bacteroid survival. An advance in our understanding of rhizobial LPS structure-function was the observation that the expression of O-antigen/LPS structure can change dramatically upon progression from the free-living state to the bacteroid form. The structural details of this phase shift in LPS surface chemistry were recently described in the Sinorhizobium sp. NGR234 model system, where LPS expression shifts from that of a structurally complex, highly branched anionic rough LPS (lacking O-antigen) to an endogenously methylated, hydrophobic, rhamnan O-antigen (attached to a structurally modified core lipid A, i.e. a smooth LPS) (6Reuhs B.L.

These structural changes also occur on nitrogen-fixing bacteroids isolated from host Vigna unguiculata nodules (6Reuhs B.L. Relic B. Forsberg L.S. Marie C. Ojanen-Reuhs T. Stephens S.B. Wong C.H.

Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the other model system recently studied, that of R. etli-Phaseolus vulgaris, the transition from free-living state to bacteroid was accompanied by specific changes in the location and extent of O-methylation of O-antigen, changes that could also result in an alteration of bacteroid surface hydrophobicity (7D'Haeze W.

These and related studies indicate that a variety of changes in LPS surface chemistry occur during or immediately prior to differentiation of the free-living rhizobia (as exists within the infection threads) into bacteroids (2Kannenberg, E.

Continuing our analysis of the R. leguminosarum-Pisum model system, we have characterized the structure of the O-polysaccharide portion of the LPS from the free-living form of R. leguminosarum 3841 bv. viciae. Like R. etli, this bacterium synthesizes a structurally complex, low molecular mass OPS of uniform size, with endogenous O-methylation and O-acetylation contributing to structural heterogeneity. In addition, we have identified a new glycosyl residue, 3-acetimidoylamino-3-deoxy-d-gluco-hexuronic acid (Glc3NAmA, rhizoaminuronic acid) as a component of the 3841 OPS repeating unit. This is apparently the only known hexosaminuronic acid lacking an amino group at C2.

Cells were pelleted at late log phase (A600 = 2.50) and then washed by resuspending in phosphate-buffered saline followed by centrifugation to remove exopolysaccharides and culture media, yielding 648 g (wet weight) of cells per 100 liters of culture. Isolation of Lipopolysaccharide and O-polysaccharide—The washed cells were extracted using a hot phenol/water procedure in which the water layer contained 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% sodium azide, and 50 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.0, as described previously (11Reuhs B.L.

The total LPS was subjected to mild hydrolysis in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 4 h at 105 °C. Lipid A was removed by ultracentrifugation, and the polymeric carbohydrate portion (O-polysaccharide; OPS) was isolated by chromatography using a Bio-Gel P-10 column (45-90 μm, 1.5 × 90 cm). Further procedures describing lipid A and core oligosaccharide removal are in the supplemental material. Fractionation of O-polysaccharides by HPLC—The void volume from the Bio-Gel P-10 column, which contained the total soluble OPSs, was dialyzed, concentrated, and fractionated into separate polysaccharide components using an Asahipak-NH2P-50 4E column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) equipped with matching guard column (4.6 × 10 mm) and NH2P-LF pre-injector line filter (Shodex, Showa Denko K.K., Tokyo, Japan, distributed by Thomson Instrument Co.). The column was eluted at 0.7 ml/min at 35 °C, with a linear A/B gradient starting at 5% reagent B and ending at 70% B over ∼1 h. Reagent A consisted of 75% acetonitrile, 25% water, v/v, and reagent B consisted of 20% acetonitrile, 80% aqueous 1 m ammonium formate, pH 4.4, v/v. Adjustment of the 1 m aqueous NH4formate to pH 4.4 was performed with formic acid prior to adding the acetonitrile. The eluate was split 90:10 between a fraction collector (90%) and an evaporative light scattering detector (10%) (PL-ELS-1000, Polymer Laboratories). The eluate was also monitored by measuring UV absorbance at 215 nm. Chromatography was performed on an AKTA system (Amersham Biosciences) collecting 0.3-ml fractions. Appropriate OPS fractions were combined, dialyzed, concentrated by rotary vacuum evaporation, and subjected to structural analysis. De-O-acylation of OPS and Conversion of N-Acetimidoyl to N-Acetyl Groups—Portions (6-8 mg) of the OPS fractions purified by HPLC were de-O-acylated by treating with 12.5% v/v aqueous ammonia for 12 h at 35 °C (27Zähringer U.

The reactions were dialyzed versus water, then concentrated by rotary vacuum evaporation, and subjected to analysis. Preparation and Fractionation of Oligosaccharide Subunits—OPS samples were subjected to graded acid hydrolysis to establish conditions giving a maximal yield of fairly large oligosaccharides, with minimal yield of monosaccharides and minimal amounts of unhydrolyzed polymer. Typically, for the de-O-acylated polysaccharide, 0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid at 105 °C for 1.5 h was most effective, whereas for the native polymer, which was extensively O-acetylated, 3 h was required to obtain maximum yield of oligosaccharides. The products were evaluated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex-Peptide HR 10/30 FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with 50 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.0. The oligo- and monosaccharide products were monitored by evaporative light scattering detection with a 9:1 split. Semi-preparative amounts of oligosaccharides were generated by hydrolyzing 2-4 mg of polysaccharide per chromatographic run. Fractions were collected (0.4 ml), and the saccharides were subjected to structural analysis. Glycosyl Analyses—Carbohydrate compositions of the OPS and derived fractions were determined by preparing the TMS methylglycosides with GC-MS (electron impact) analysis (13Forsberg L.S. Noel K.D.

Carbohydrate identities and the locations of endogenous O-methyl groups were also determined by GC-MS analysis of the alditol acetates, using a 30-m SP-2330 capillary column (Supelco). Glycosyl residues containing carboxyl groups were analyzed by preparing carboxyl-reduced alditol acetates by converting the carboxyl groups to methyl esters (1 m methanolic HCl, 80 °C for 2 h), followed by carboxyl reduction with NaBD4 in water, 2 m trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, and conversion to the alditol acetates (13Forsberg L.S.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18851-18863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Authentic 6-deoxytalose (l-isomer) was obtained from a streptococcal cell wall glycan (32Pazur J.H. Forsberg L.S. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1980; 8: 107-116Google Scholar). Where possible, the absolute configuration of glycosyl residues was determined by preparing the diastereomeric TMS (-)-2-butylglycoside derivatives (33Gerwig G.J. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1979; 77: 1-7Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar). GC-MS analysis was performed on a DB-1 column with comparisons to authentic d-Fuc and l-Fuc. Linkage analysis of neutral sugars was performed by permethylation (Hakomori method), conversion to the PMAAs (13Forsberg L.S. Noel K.D. Box J. Carlson R.W. J. Biol.

The 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and other acidic residue linkages were identified by sequential permethylation, reduction of the carboxymethyl groups with lithium triethylborodeuteride (Aldrich), mild hydrolysis (0.1 m trifluoroacetic acid, 100 °C, 30 min) to cleave ketosidic linkages, reduction (NaBD4), and conversion to the PMAAs and GC-MS analysis (34Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Methylations using trideuteriomethyl iodide were also performed to confirm sugar identities and location of endogenous O-methyl ether groups. Oligosaccharide subunits derived from the OPS were analyzed as the permethylated oligosaccharide alditols by reduction of the reducing end with NaBD4, followed by methyl esterification/permethylation (Hakomori method). The products were analyzed by electron impact GC-MS (using SP-23230 and DB-5 columns), and by chemical ionization (CI) MS, using a 30-m DB-1 column with ammonia as reactant gas. Mass Spectrometry—Samples of OPS and derived oligosaccharides were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, using a Voyager-DE time of flight (TOF) spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Boston) in the positive and negative modes, using a matrix of 100 mm 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 90% methanol. The instrument was operated at an accelerating voltage of 25 kV with extraction delay time of 200 ns. Samples were desorbed with a nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm) and the detector sensitivity was 1000 mV full scale. Mass spectra were recorded over a m/z range of 500-20,000; spectra are the summation of 200 acquisitions. Maltooligosaccharides (degree of polymerization 3-15) were used for calibration. Electrospray ionization-Q-TOF (ESI-Q-TOF) MS analysis was performed on a Q-TOFII instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with an electrospray source. Samples were infused into the nebulizer at 5 μl/min, using nitrogen as the nebulization gas, and spectra were collected in the positive ion mode. The predicted molecular mass of the various saccharides was calculated using the following average incremental mass values, based on the atomic weights of the elements: hexose, 162.142; Kdo, 220.179; anhydro-Kdo, 202.164; 6-deoxyhexose, 146.143; mono-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 160.170; di-O-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, 174.197; 2-N-acetamido-2,6-dideoxyhexose, 187.196; 3-N-acetamido-3-deoxyhexuronic acid, 217.178; acetimidoyl 41.052; free reducing end, 18.015. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analyses—1H spectra and two-dimensional homo- and heteronuclear spectra of the OPS and derived oligosaccharides were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian Inova 600- or 800-MHz spectrometer, using a 5-mm triple probe and the standard Varian software (Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA). Polymeric samples were analyzed on the 800-MHz instrument, whereas derived oligosaccharides were analyzed on the 600-MHz instrument. Polysaccharides were dissolved in D2O yielding clear solutions at ∼5 mg/ml; spectra were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (δH 0.00 ppm). Oligosaccharides were analyzed at 300-500 μg/260 μl of D2O using 5-mm symmetrical microtubes matched for D2O (Shigemi Inc., Allison Park, PA). In most experiments pre-saturation was applied to the residual HDO signal. 1H-1H COSY (35Piantini U. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem.

https://openalex.org/W2125077120,"Human extracellular superoxide dismutase (EC-SOD) is a tetrameric glycoprotein responsible for the removal of superoxide generated in the extracellular space. Two different folding variants of EC-SOD exist based on the disulfide bridge connectivity, resulting in enzymatically active (aEC-SOD) and inactive (iEC-SOD) subunits. As a consequence of this, the assembly of the EC-SOD tetramers produces molecules with variable activity and may represent a way to regulate the antioxidant level in the extracellular space. To determine whether the formation of these two folding variants is an intra- or extracellular event, we analyzed the biosynthesis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing wild-type EC-SOD. These analyses revealed that both folding variants were present in the intra- and extracellular spaces, suggesting that the formation is an intracellular event. To further analyze the biosynthesis, we constructed mutants with the capacity to generate only aEC-SOD (C195S) or iEC-SOD (C45S). The expression of these suggested that the cellular biosynthetic machinery supported the secretion of aEC-SOD but not iEC-SOD. The coexpression of these two mutants did not affect the expression pattern. This study shows that generation of the EC-SOD folding variants is an intracellular event that depends on a free cysteine residue not involved in disulfide bonding.

The protein is a highly stable metalloenzyme containing copper and zinc ions, which support enzymatic and structural activities, respectively, and is predominantly found as a tetramer, although an octamer can be detected in EC-SOD purified from human tissue (4Marklund S.L.

Engstrom A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). One cysteine residue (Cys219) is involved in the formation of disulfide-linked homodimers (5Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the remaining five residues are disulfide-bonded in two different ways, generating distinct folding variants (17Petersen S.V. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13875-13880Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). One isozyme, aEC-SOD is active, whereas the other isoform, iEC-SOD, is not. Interestingly, the primary sequence of EC-SOD from rabbit (Swiss-Prot accession number P41975), mouse (accession number O09164), and rat (accession number Q08420) does not contain a specific cysteine residue essential for the formation of iEC-SOD, indicating that these species produce only aEC-SOD (18Petersen S.V. Due A.V. Valnickova Z. Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14275-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds of secreted proteins are generated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the action of thiol isomerase enzymes, including protein-disulfide isomerase (19Ellgaard L. Ruddock L.W. EMBO Rep. 2005; 6: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Although the majority of thiol isomerase enzymes are present in the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing evidence suggests that these proteins are also present in the extracellular space (20Turano C. Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The formation of disulfide bonds may serve several functions: (i) to confer stability to the overall protein structure; (ii) to participate directly in protein activity as seen in thiol/disulfide oxidoreductases, including thioredoxin; and (iii) to allosterically regulate protein activity by the reduction/oxidation of cysteines not directly participating in protein activity (21Schmidt B. Ho L. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7429-7433Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The presence of extracellular thiol isomerases and allosteric disulfide bonds demonstrates that the activity of extracellular proteins can be modulated by changing the redox status of specific cysteine residues. This type of regulation is now becoming evident in a number of proteins, including tissue factor (22Chen V.M. Ahamed J. Versteeg H.H. Berndt M.C. Ruf W. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12020-12028Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and CD4 (23Matthias L.J. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Vandegraaff N. Li P. Poumbourios P. Donoghue N. Hogg P.J. Nat.

Olsen D.A. Kenney J.M. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but it has until now been unclear whether the generation of aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD is an intra- or extracellular event. In this study, we present evidence that both variants are synthesized intracellularly. Moreover, our analyses indicate that the correct assembly of disulfide bridges in iEC-SOD depends on a free cysteine residue not involved in disulfide bonding, further supporting a role for thiol/disulfide exchange reactions in the biosynthesis of EC-SOD. Materials—Porcine trypsin (sequence grade) was purchased from Promega. A peptide representing Ala94–Cys107 (AIHVHQFGDLSQLC) of human EC-SOD was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester chemistry, and the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-peptide conjugate was subsequently used as an antigen emulsified in Freundŉs adjuvant (Sigma Genosys). The generated rabbit antiserum detects both aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD by Western blotting following separation of nonreduced tryptic digests by electrophoresis using a Tris/Tricine/SDS buffer system (see below). Proteins—EC-SOD was purified from human aorta or from cell culture supernatants using heparin affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography as described previously (5Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The intracellular pool of EC-SOD was enriched from cells transiently expressing wild-type EC-SOD. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution; lysed by the addition of 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 5 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody directed against human EC-SOD (16Olsen D.A. Petersen S.V. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Kristensen T. Bowler R.P. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. J. Biol.

Protein was eluted using 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.7), and fractions were immediately neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Fractions containing EC-SOD (evaluated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting) were pooled and stored at 4 °C. Construction of Expression Plasmids—The C45S and C195S EC-SOD mutants were constructed according to the QuikChange method using Herculase enhanced DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and DpnI (New England Biolabs). The template used was pcDNA3-cloned wild-type EC-SOD cDNA. PCR was performed with annealing at 60 °C and elongation times of 10 min in 16 cycles. The primers used were as follows (with the mutation underlined): C45S, 5′-CAGGCTCCACGCCGCCTCCCAGGTGCAGCCGTCGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCGACGGCTGCACCTGGGAGGCGGCGTGGAGCGTG-3′ (reverse); and C195S, 5′-CTGCGTGGTGGGCGTGTCCGGGCCCGGGCTCTGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCCAGAGCCCGGGCCCGGACACGCCCACCACGCAG-3′ (reverse). The sequences of expression constructs generated were verified by sequence analysis of both strands. Expression of Recombinant Protein—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbeccoŉs modified Eagleŉs medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were plated onto 9-cm tissue culture dishes and transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate co-precipitation (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) using 17 μg of plasmid DNA or, in the case of cotransfections, 8.5 μg of each plasmid DNA encoding EC-SOD variants. Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Quantum Prep midi-prep kit (Bio-Rad). After 48 h, the culture medium was replaced by serum-free medium. The medium was changed three times at intervals of 24 h, pooled, clarified by centrifugation, and subsequently analyzed for expression of EC-SOD by Western blotting. Cells used for the analysis of intracellular protein were harvested after 48 h in serum-free medium. Trypsin Digestion—Purified EC-SOD was lyophilized, and free cysteine residues were blocked by the addition of 20 mm iodoacetamide in 50 mm HEPES, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, and 20 mm 8-hydroxyquinoline (pH 8.3). The S-carbamidomethylated protein was recovered by reversephase chromatography using microcolumns containing Poros reverse-phase R1 resin (27Gobom J. Nordhoff E. Mirgorodskaya E. Ekman R. Roepstorff P. J. Mass Spectrom. 1999; 34: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and eluted using 90% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The lyophilized material was resuspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate; trypsin was added at an enzyme/protein ratio of 1:50; and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 5–15% gradient gels and the glycine/2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol HCl buffer system (28Bury A.F. J. Chromatogr. 1981; 213: 491-500Crossref Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Samples analyzed under denaturing conditions were boiled in the presence of 0.5% (w/v) SDS. Reducing conditions were obtained by the addition of 30 mm dithiothreitol. Samples analyzed by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis were analyzed without boiling prior to electrophoresis, and SDS was omitted in all buffers used. Peptides were separated by Tris/Tricine/SDS-gel electrophoresis using 16.5% acrylamide gels (29Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—Proteins separated by electrophoresis were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 10 mm CAPS and 10% methanol (pH 11) (30Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides separated by Tris/Tricine/SDS-gel electrophoresis were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 25 mm Tris-HCl and 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3) (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4). EC-SOD protein was subsequently detected using rabbit anti-human EC-SOD antiserum, and EC-SOD peptides were detected using rabbit antiserum directed against a peptide representing Ala94–Cys107. The blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ig (Sigma) and enhanced chemiluminescence. SOD Activity—Proteins were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, and the gel was subsequently equilibrated three times for 10 min each with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The gel was equilibrated with nitro blue tetrazolium, riboflavin, and TEMED as described (5Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Valnickova Z. Enghild J.J. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and SOD activity was detected by exposure to light. The activity was also determined in fluid phase using the xanthine oxidase/cytochrome c assay (32McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration used to calculate specific activity was estimated using absorption at 280 nm. EC-SOD Folding Variants Are Generated Intracellularly—We detected previously the presence of aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD in purified EC-SOD by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography of tryptic digests (17Petersen S.V. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13875-13880Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the presence of aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD may also be analyzed conveniently by nonreducing Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis. The detection of a 8.6-kDa (calculated) triple peptide confirmed the presence of aEC-SOD, whereas a 6.1-kDa (calculated) double peptide confirmed the presence of iEC-SOD (Fig. 1). The analysis of tissue-derived EC-SOD produced two bands with relative molecular masses of ∼11 and 6 kDa (Fig. 2). Analysis by N-terminal sequencing revealed that the 11-kDa band contained three N-terminal sequences representing the three tryptic peptides encompassing Cys45, Cys107, and Cys189/Cys190/Cys195, whereas the 6-kDa band produced two N-terminal sequences representing the peptides encompassing Cys107 and Cys189/ Cys190/Cys195 (data not shown). These analyses corroborated the presence of the two folding variants in purified EC-SOD.FIGURE 2Analysis of authentic EC-SOD by Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis.A, human EC-SOD purified from aorta and medium collected from transfected HEK 293 cells was digested by trypsin and analyzed by Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Intact EC-SOD and trypsin were included as controls. Molecular mass markers are included on the left. Bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. B, EC-SOD isolated from the intracellular compartment of transfected HEK 293 cells was digested with trypsin. The generated disulfide-linked peptides were separated by Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions and detected by Western blotting. Purified intact EC-SOD (aorta) and digested material (aorta + trypsin; two concentrations) were included as controls. This analysis showed that both folding variants are present in authentic and recombinant EC-SOD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To use recombinant protein expression for further studies, we first established that the eukaryotic expression system used supports the generation of both folding variants. EC-SOD purified from the medium of transfected HEK 293 cells was digested with trypsin and analyzed by nonreducing Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis. The band pattern produced was identical to that of tissue-derived EC-SOD, confirming that the transfected HEK 293 cells produced both folding variants (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether the generation of EC-SOD folding variants is an intra- or extracellular event, we analyzed the cell lysate of HEK 293 cells producing wild-type EC-SOD. The analysis of this material similarly produced a band pattern consistent with the presence of aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD (Fig. 2B), suggesting that the two variants are generated intracellularly before secretion. Forced Biosynthesis of Either iEC-SOD or aEC-SOD by Mutation of Cysteine Residues—In an attempt to analyze the biosynthesis of iEC-SOD or aEC-SOD separately, two EC-SOD mutants were constructed. The substitution of Cys45 for Ser (C45S) prevents the formation of aEC-SOD, as Cys45 is involved in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond (Fig. 3). The C45S substitution thus permits the generation of iEC-SOD only. Likewise, the substitution of Cys195 for Ser (C195S) eliminates the synthesis of iEC-SOD, forcing the cells to produce only aEC-SOD (Fig. 3). Expression of EC-SOD mutants was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting. The analysis of the medium derived from the C45S-transfected cells showed that it did not contain any detectable iEC-SOD (Fig. 4). The analysis of the C45S cell lysate showed two iEC-SOD bands of 32 and 29 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 4). Following peptide:N-glycosidase F treatment, only one band was detected, indicating that the difference in migration was caused by carbohydrate heterogeneity (data not shown). Moreover, it was shown previously that the EC-SOD subunit is cleaved immediately before secretion, underscoring the absence of any cleaved subunit in the intracellular compartment (14Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14818-14822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, the two bands detected represent the intact subunit in a glycosylated (32 kDa) and non-glycosylated (29 kDa) form (Fig. 4). When the analysis of the C45S cell lysate was performed using nonreducing conditions, a high molecular mass smear was apparent without the presence of distinct lower molecular mass bands (Fig. 4). Together, these findings suggest that C45S EC-SOD forms large disulfide-linked intracellular aggregates that prohibit secretion. When the medium of C195S-transfected cells was analyzed under reducing conditions, one band of 32 kDa was detected (Fig. 4), showing that the cells secrete intact and glycosylated C195S EC-SOD. Under nonreducing conditions, the material migrated as two bands of 48 and 27 kDa, representing the disulfide-linked dimer and monomer, respectively. When the C195S cell lysate was analyzed under reducing conditions, two bands identical to the C45S cells were produced, whereas the analysis at nonreducing conditions demonstrated three closely spaced bands in the range of 40–46 kDa, which are likely to represent partially processed EC-SOD. In conclusion, we have shown that C45S EC-SOD (pseudo-iEC-SOD) is produced by the cells but forms intracellular disulfide-linked aggregates, whereas C195S EC-SOD can be synthesized and secreted as an intact pseudo-aEC-SOD subunit.FIGURE 4Analysis of pseudo-EC-SOD expression. Medium (med.) and cell lysates (cells) of HEK 293 cells expressing pseudo-iEC-SOD (C45S) or pseudo-aEC-SOD (C195S) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting under nonreducing (without dithiothreitol (–DTT)) and reducing (with dithiothreitol (+DTT)) conditions as indicated. The positions of the intact subunit (reducing conditions) and the dimer/monomer (reducing conditions) are indicated. Molecular mass markers are shown in the middle. Only C195S EC-SOD could be expressed, whereas expression of C45S EC-SOD generated intracellular aggregates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) C195S EC-SOD Is an Active Tetramer—To establish whether C195S EC-SOD retains the structural and functional activities of native EC-SOD, we subjected the purified material to native gel electrophoresis. The analysis established that pseudo-aEC-SOD forms a tetramer (Fig. 5) and that the generated material is enzymatically active, as evident from the spectroscopic analysis of activity and by activity staining of protein separated by native gel electrophoresis (Fig. 5). These analyses established that C195S EC-SOD is correctly folded and retains activity. C45S/C195S EC-SOD Cotransfection of HEK 293 Cells—As the expression system has the capacity to produce both aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD when cells are transfected with a plasmid encoding wild-type EC-SOD (Fig. 1), we tested the system to determine whether the synthesis of C45S EC-SOD would be altered by the concomitant expression of C195S EC-SOD. To investigate this, we cotransfected cells with plasmids encoding both mutants. Secreted EC-SOD protein was subsequently purified from the medium, cleaved by trypsin, and subjected to analysis by nonreducing Tris/Tricine-gel electrophoresis. Only the triple peptide derived from aEC-SOD (C195S) was detected (Fig. 6). This result demonstrates that the folding of iEC-SOD (C45S) depends on factors other than aEC-SOD (C195S). The two folding variants called aEC-SOD and iEC-SOD were originally identified and characterized using authentic protein purified from human aorta (17Petersen S.V. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Thogersen I.B. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13875-13880Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our present analyses of cells expressing wild-type EC-SOD revealed that the two folding variants are generated intracellularly before secretion, demonstrating that the expression system contains the required biosynthesis machinery for production of both forms. In an attempt to investigate the biosynthesis of the two forms separately, we generated expression constructs encoding EC-SOD proteins in which serine residues were substituted for cysteine residues essential for the folding of the two forms (see Fig. 3). In theory, the C195S substitution will force the cells to produce only aEC-SOD, and the biochemical analyses of the protein produced supported this, as the cells secreted enzymatically active tetrameric EC-SOD. The substitution of Cys195 for Ser corresponds to the amino acid in rabbit, mouse, and rat EC-SOD (18Petersen S.V. Due A.V. Valnickova Z. Oury T.D. Crapo J.D. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14275-14281Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), and it is thus not surprising that this mutant was readily expressed. In contrast, the expression of C45S resulted in intracellular disulfide-bonded aggregation, and iEC-SOD was not detected in the medium. The substitution of serine for cysteine is generally used to analyze the function of cysteine residues because of the structural similarity of the side chains, and it is therefore intriguing that the C45S mutation generated large disulfide-bonded intracellular aggregates. This indicates that the inability to secrete iEC-SOD resides in the failure to generate the correct disulfide bridge pattern. This suggests that Cys45 (although free in mature iEC-SOD) is involved in the folding process, most likely by forming a transient disulfide bridge. Alternatively, aEC-SOD might promote the proper folding of iEC-SOD. However, coexpression experiments did not support this scenario, as only aEC-SOD was secreted. Together, these analyses have demonstrated that the presence of Cys45 is essential for the generation of iEC-SOD, suggesting that this residue participates actively during the folding process. The folding of EC-SOD is likely to involve metallochaperones during the insertion of copper and zinc and oxidoreductases to establish the correct disulfide bridge patterns. In this respect, it is interesting to note that the insertion of copper into Cu,Zn-SOD (9Hjalmarsson K. Marklund S.L. Engstrom A. Edlund T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6340-6344Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) involves a transient interprotein disulfide bridge between a metallochaperone and Cu,Zn-SOD (33Lamb A.L. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 751-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Following the insertion of copper, the cysteine residue of Cu,Zn-SOD involved in the interprotein disulfide bridge is oxidized to generate a disulfide bond essential for catalytic activity (34Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 181-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 35Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. D'Amelio N. Gaggelli E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 2333-2337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The insertion of copper into EC-SOD involves the activity of the metallochaperone Atox1 (antioxidant-1; also known as HAH1) (36Jeney V. Itoh S. Wendt M. Gradek Q. Ushio-Fukai M. Harrison D.G. Fukai T. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), which is a cytosolic protein that mediates the transport of copper into the trans-Golgi network via copper transporters in the membrane (37O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). The transport of copper from Atox1 to EC-SOD appears to be mediated by ATP7A (Menkes protein) (38Qin Z. Itoh S. Jeney V. Ushio-Fukai M. Fukai T. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Importantly, this copper shuttle involves the chelation of copper by cysteine residues in both Atox1 (39Pufahl R.A. Singer C.P. Peariso K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P.J. Fahrni C.J. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar, 40Wernimont A.K. Huffman D.L. Lamb A.L. O'Halloran T.V. Rosenzweig A.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and ATP7A (41Gitschier J. Moffat B. Reilly D. Wood W.I. Fairbrother W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In analogy to the folding of Cu,Zn-SOD, it may be hypothesized that the folding of EC-SOD involves a number of transient inter- or intramolecular disulfide bridges or that free cysteine residues are important for the acceptance of copper from the ATP7A copper transporter. This hypothesis is substantiated by our studies showing that Cys45 is essential for the folding of iEC-SOD, whereas Cys195 does not seem to have any effect on the folding of aEC-SOD. The regulation of protein activity by allosteric disulfide bridges involves the redox status of cysteine residues not directly involved in protein function, as e.g. the regulation of CD4 (23Matthias L.J. Yam P.T. Jiang X.M. Vandegraaff N. Li P. Poumbourios P. Donoghue N. Hogg P.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is not clear if the two folding variants of human EC-SOD can interconvert or whether these two forms are the result of different folding pathways generating stable end products. However, a putative interconversion between the two folding variants of human EC-SOD will require the disruption and regeneration of two disulfide bonds, and it is therefore likely to involve chaperones. Although generation/isomerization of disulfide bridges may be complex, increasing evidence suggests that these covalent bonds are more dynamic than previously thought and can undergo significant rearrangements to modulate functional activity. An example of this is the mitochondrial copper chaperone Cox17, which contains six highly conserved cysteine residues. This protein can exist in three different conformers: (i) fully reduced with the capacity to bind four copper ions, (ii) containing two disulfide bridges with the capacity to bind one copper ion, and (iii) fully oxidized without copper binding capacity (42Palumaa P. Kangur L. Voronova A. Sillard R. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 307-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The physiological function of this protein has been speculated to reside in the redox status of cysteine residues (43Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interconversion of the fully oxidized form requires the reduction of a disulfide bridge between vicinal cysteine residues and a subsequent isomerization of disulfide bridges (43Arnesano F. Balatri E. Banci L. Bertini I. Winge D.R. Structure (Camb.). 2005; 13: 713-722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a sequence of steps that would also convert iEC-SOD into aEC-SOD. We have shown that the two folding variants of human EC-SOD are generated intracellularly and that the folding of these two forms is likely to involve transient disulfide bridges. It was shown previously that post-translational modifications of EC-SOD can be modulated tissue-specifically (14Enghild J.J. Thogersen I.B. Oury T.D. Valnickova Z. Hojrup P. Crapo J.D. J. Biol.

Oury T.D. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1198-1207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). At present, it is not clear whether the synthesis of the two folding variants of human EC-SOD can be regulated; however, the presence of extracellular oxidoreductases (20Turano C. Coppari S. Altieri F. Ferraro A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 193: 154-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and redox-sensitive chaperones (46Hoffmann J.H. Linke K. Graf P.C. Lilie H. Jakob U.

https://openalex.org/W2168672135,"Neocarzinostatin, a clinical anticancer drug, is the archetypal member of the chromoprotein family of enediyne antitumor antibiotics that are composed of a nonprotein chromophore and an apoprotein. The neocarzinostatin chromophore consists of a nine-membered enediyne core, a deoxyaminosugar, and a naphthoic acid moiety. We have previously cloned and sequenced the neocarzinostatin biosynthetic gene cluster and proposed that the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety and its incorporation into the neocarzinostatin chromophore are catalyzed by five enzymes NcsB, NcsB1, NcsB2, NcsB3, and NcsB4. Here we report the biochemical characterization of NcsB1, unveiling that: (i) NcsB1 is an S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent O-methyltransferase; (ii) NcsB1 catalyzes regiospecific methylation at the 7-hydroxy group of its native substrate, 2,7-dihydroxy-5-methyl-1-naphthoic acid; (iii) NcsB1 also recognizes other dihydroxynaphthoic acids as substrates and catalyzes regiospecific O-methylation; and (iv) the carboxylate and its ortho-hydroxy groups of the substrate appear to be crucial for NcsB1 substrate recognition and binding, and O-methylation takes place only at the free hydroxy group of these dihydroxynaphthoic acids. These findings establish that NcsB1 catalyzes the third step in the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid moiety of the neocarzinostatin chromophore and further support the early proposal for the biosynthesis of the naphthoic acid and its incorporation into the neocarzinostatin chromophore with free naphthoic acids serving as intermediates. NcsB1 represents another opportunity that can now be exploited to produce novel neocarzinostatin analogs by engineering neocarzinostatin biosynthesis or applying directed biosynthesis strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2055861028,"The development of dendritic arbors is critical in neuronal circuit formation, as dendrites are the primary sites of synaptic input. Morphologically specialized dendritic protrusions called spines represent the main postsynaptic compartment for excitatory neurotransmission. Recently, we demonstrated that chicken acidic leucine-rich epidermal growth factor (EGF) -like domain-containing brain protein/neuroglycan C (CALEB/NGC), a neural member of the EGF family, mediates dendritic tree and spine complexity but that the signaling pathways in the respective processes differ. For a more detailed characterization of these signal transduction pathways, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with CALEB/NGC. Our results show that B56beta, a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, interacts with CALEB/NGC and inhibits CALEB/NGC-mediated dendritic branching but not spine formation. Binding of B56beta to CALEB/NGC was confirmed by several biochemical and immunocytochemical assays. Using affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the whole protein phosphatase 2A trimer, including structural and catalytic subunits, binds to CALEB/NGC via B56beta. We show that CALEB/NGC induces the phosphorylation of Akt in dendrites. Previously described to interfere with Akt signaling, B56beta inhibits Akt phosphorylation and Akt-dependent dendritic branching but not Akt-independent spine formation induced by CALEB/NGC. Our results contribute to a better understanding of signaling specificity leading to neuronal process differentiation in sequential developmental events."

The large cytoplasmic domain (f-loop) of NCX is required for regulation by various intracellular factors, and we have shown previously that residues 562–679 are determinants of NCX inhibition by exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP). Here we show that the same f-loop deletion eliminates the enhancement of NCX current by insulin, and we examine the signal pathways involved in the insulin response. NCX current (INCX) was measured in freshly isolated or cultured (up to 48 h) adult guinea pig myocytes and in myocytes expressing canine NCX1.1 with the 562–679 f-loop deletion (NCX-(Δ562–679)) via adenoviral gene transfer. INCX was recorded by whole-cell patch clamp as the Ni2+-sensitive current at 37 °C with intracellular Ca2+ buffered.

NCX regulation by insulin has also been proposed as one of the underlying mechanisms responsible for the positive inotropic effect of insulin on the failing myocardium (10Hsu C.H. Wei J. Chen Y.C.

Investig. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Because NCX is the main mechanism for removing Ca2+ from the cell, accounting for up to 30% of the total systolic Ca2+ removal in large animals, a significant reduction in exchanger activity could increase intracellular Ca2+ and may contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy as a result of altered diastolic Ca2+ removal (12Dhalla N.S. Pierce G.N. Innes I.R. Beamish R.E. Can. J. Cardiol. 1985; 1: 263-281PubMed Google Scholar). The pleiotropic actions of insulin are mediated by a cascade of parallel signaling pathways within the cell. The binding of insulin to its receptor results in the activation of its intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity with several downstream effects. One of the earliest steps of insulin signaling involves phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). This membrane-associated lipid is hydrolyzed by phospholipase Cγ to generate diacylglycerol, which activates protein kinase C (PKC), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which activates IP3-gated intracellular Ca2+ release channels. PIP2 phosphorylation by PI3-kinase leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (13Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar, 14Leevers S.J. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). PIP3 can then activate downstream kinases, including phosphoinositide-dependent kinase and Akt (protein kinase B), stimulating glycogen synthesis, growth, and the trafficking of glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the plasmalemma. Other actions of insulin receptor activation include the stimulation of src homology domain kinases and the small RAS GTPases to activate gene transcription responses. The involvement of PIP2 in the insulin response is of particular interest with respect to potential regulation of NCX, because PIP2 has already been shown to modulate the activity of NCX in giant patch experiments (15Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar) and influence NCX trafficking to the membrane (16Bossuyt J. Taylor B.E. James-Kracke M. Hale C.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hydrophobicity analysis of the NCX primary sequence suggests nine transmembrane regions with a large hydrophilic region between segments 5 and 6 (f-loop) (17Nicoll D.A. Ottolia M. Lu L. Lu Y.

Ion exchange and transport functions are associated with the transmembrane segments, whereas exchanger regulation appears to be mediated by the large (520 amino acids) cytoplasmic domain f-loop. This intracellular loop is essential for regulation of NCX activity by a number of intracellular factors (see reviews in Refs. 18Philipson K.D. Nicoll D.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 111-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 19Shigekawa M. Iwamoto T. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 864-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). At the N-terminal end of the f-loop, there is a domain referred to as the endogenous exchanger inhibitory peptide (XIP) region (20Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a synthetic peptide with the same sequence as the endogenous XIP region is applied to the intracellular side of the membrane, NCX function is potently inhibited (20Li Z. Nicoll D.A. Collins A. Hilgemann D.W. Filoteo A.G. Penniston J.T. Weiss J.N. Tomich J.M. Philipson K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1014-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PIP2 activation of the exchanger is also thought to involve the XIP domain of NCX (21Shannon T.R. Hale C.C. Milanick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1350-C1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous evidence from our laboratory indicated that f-loop residues 562–679 contain sites involved in the regulation of the NCX by the endogenous XIP region (22Maack C. Ganesan A. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Deletion of these amino acids eliminated XIP-induced inhibition of NCX in either non-cardiac cell lines or in adult guinea pig cardiomyocytes (22Maack C. Ganesan A. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, the aims of the present study were to evaluate the effects of insulin on the native NCX current (INCX) and to examine the role of the 562–679 f-loop deletion on the insulin response in intact adult myocytes. Viral Vectors—The coding sequence for the canine wild-type NCX (NCX1.1) was a gift from Dr. Kenneth Philipson (University of California, Los Angeles). The deletion mutant Δ562–679 was constructed as described previously (22Maack C. Ganesan A. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) by deleting amino acids 562–679, corresponding to the sequence FQNDEI... EHTKLEV of NCX using an Exsite polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Adult Cardiac Guinea Pig Myocyte Experiments—Animal protocols used were in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, published by the U. S. National Institutes of Health (NIH publication number 85-23, revised 1996) and were approved by The Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee. Isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes were obtained by enzymatic digestion as described previously (23O'Rourke B. Ramza B.M. Marban E. Science. 1994; 265: 962-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Freshly isolated myocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 15 mmol/liter HEPES (Invitrogen), pH 7.4, on laminin-coated coverslips in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. After 2 h, the myocytes were either used for patch clamp experiments or infected with adenovirus carrying the deletion mutant gene of NCX (pAdEcd-Δ562–679), together with a bicistronic vector containing a cytomegalovirus-driven green fluorescent protein sequence and a Drosophila/Bombyx-driven ecdysone receptor (pAdCGI-DBEcR) at a ratio of 10:1 as described previously (24Hoppe U.C. Marban E. Johns D.C. Mol. Ther. 2000; 1: 159-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The fluorescence emission of the green fluorescent protein reporter enabled us to identify transfected cells. Viruses were added to myocytes 2 h after being plated on coverslips. After 1 h, the medium was changed for Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin with the addition of ponasterone A (1–5 μg/ml; Invitrogen) in order to induce the expression. Medium with ponasterone A was exchanged every 24 h. Experiments were carried out 36–50 h post-induction. Whole-Cell Patch Clamp Recording—For INCX measurements, coverslips were mounted in a heated recording chamber (37 °C) on the stage of a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300) and superfused with external solution contained (in mmol/liter) NaCl 128, CsCl 10, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, sodium-HEPES 10, glucose 10, pH 7.4, with CsOH. The solution was K+-free to block inward rectifier K+- and Na+-K+-ATPase currents and also contained (in μmol/liter) nifedipine 10, 4-acetamido-4′-isothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (SITS) 100, and ouabain 0.5 in order to block L-type Ca2+, Cl-, and Na+-K+-ATPase currents, respectively. The internal solution contained (in mmol/liter) CsCl 120, CaCl2 3, MgCl2 0.5, Na+-HEPES 20, Mg-ATP 5, (K+)4-BAPTA 5, pH 7.25. The free internal calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was 200 nmol/liter calculated using the Maxchelator program (25Patton C. Thompson S. Epel D. Cell Calcium. 2004; 35: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The pipette-to-bath liquid junction potential was -2.7 mV and was corrected. Where indicated, XIP (RRLLFYKYVYKRYRAGKQRG) 100 μmol/liter, synthesized and purified by the protein synthesis core facility of The Johns Hopkins University, was added to the pipette solution. In some experiments PIP2 was added (30 or 60 μmol/liter) to the pipette solution. This solution was sonicated before use for 15 min. For cholesterol depletion to disrupt the caveolae (26Balijepalli R.C. Foell J.D. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar), the myocytes were treated with 1 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were voltage-clamped at a holding potential (EH) of -40 mV, with families of pulses applied from +80 to -80 mV (in 20-mV steps) for 300 ms at 0.5 Hz. After each pulse, voltage returned to EH. The NCX blocker NiCl2 (Ni2+, 10 mmol/liter) was added to the superfusing solution at the end of each experiment to obtain the Ni2+-sensitive current, representing INCX, calculated by subtracting the currents recorded in Ni2+ from the current recorded without Ni2+. The currents were measured at the end of the depolarizing pulse. For each cell, capacitative current was recorded to determine the membrane capacitance, which was used to calculate current density. The average cell capacitance was 97.36 ± 2.01 pF for cardiac fresh myocytes (n = 80), 83.29 ± 3.85 pF for cultured myocytes (n = 22), and 77.86 ± 2.41 pF for cultured myocytes expressing Δ562–679 (n = 49). Membrane currents were recorded as described previously (21Shannon T.R. Hale C.C. Milanick M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1350-C1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in whole-cell voltage clamp mode (Axopatch 200A amplifier, Digidata 1200B interface; Axon Instruments) with 2–4 MΩ pipettes, to give typical total series resistances of <10 MΩ. Electrophysiological signals were digitized, stored, and analyzed using custom-written software. Statistics—All data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis between groups was performed by a paired or unpaired Student's t test. For multiple comparisons, analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls post hoc test was used. A value of p < 0.05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. The Insulin Response and the Role of the f-Loop—Membrane currents were evoked by depolarizing pulses between +80 and -80 mV from a holding potential of -40 mV in guinea pig myocytes at 37 °C at baseline (Fig. 1A, Control) in the presence of insulin (1 μmol/liter, Fig. 1B) and after the addition of NiCl2 (10 mmol/liter, Fig. 1C). The mean Ni2+-sensitive current, hereafter referred to as INCX in all figures, was increased >2-fold across the entire voltage range by insulin as shown in the current density versus voltage (I-V) plots (Fig. 1E). A significant increase was observed for both reverse mode (at +80 mV +128.4 ± 28.6%, n = 9, p < 0.05) and forward mode INCX (at -80 mV +147.4 ± 38.7%, n = 9, p < 0.05) by 10 min after the insulin addition. Control currents recorded over the same time period in the absence of insulin did not show any significant change in INCX (data not shown). The average reversal potential, estimated as the zero current potential of the Ni2+-sensitive current (Erev) of NCX, was -40.7 ± 4.7 and -34.9 ± 2.6 mV (n = 9, NS) in the absence and presence of insulin, respectively. Previous evidence indicates that in intact adult cardiomyocytes f-loop residues 562–679 contain the regulatory sites for XIP, but not those involved in Ca2+ activation of NCX (22Maack C. Ganesan A. Sidor A. O'Rourke B. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To examine whether that portion of the exchanger participated in the insulin effect, in vitro adenoviral gene transfer of canine NCX1.1 with the amino acids 562–679 of f-loop deleted (NCX-(Δ562–679)) into adult guinea pig myocytes was performed. The cumulative I-V plots of INCX for non-infected cultured myocytes (Fig. 2A), myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) (Fig. 2B), and myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) with XIP in the pipette solution (Fig. 2C) were determined in the presence or absence of insulin. XIP was included in order to block any remaining native guinea pig INCX, which was predominantly replaced by the mutant NCX more than 24 h after viral transduction. Basal INCX density in all groups and at all voltages tested did not differ significantly when fresh myocytes, non-infected cultured myocytes, myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679), myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) with XIP in the pipette solution, and myocytes expressing wild-type canine NCX1.1 were compared (Fig. 2D; INCX at +80 mV: 2.33 ± 0.57 pA/pF, 3.81 ± 0.95 pA/pF, 2.78 ± 0.65 pA/pF, 4.42 ± 0.53 pA/pF, 3.14 ± 0.68 pA/pF, respectively, NS). The insulin effect in both NCX modes was still present in non-infected cultured myocytes (increase at +80 mV +65.22 ± 17.7%; at -80 mV +172.5 ± 59.9%, p < 0.05, n = 6) and in cultured myocytes expressing wild-type NCX1.1 (increase at +80 mV +54.5 ± 15.14%, at -80 mV +86.37 ± 25.12%, p < 0.05) but was substantially decreased in myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) (increase at +80 mV, +32.2 ± 14.5% and at -80 mV, +31.2 ± 19.9%; n = 8; NS versus control). This residual insulin response was largely eliminated in the presence of XIP (increase at +80 mV: +17.0 ± 10.5%; increase at -80 mV: +21.5 ± 17.5%; n = 9; NS). The NCX conductance (GNCX), calculated as the linear slope of the I-V plots, increased significantly with acute insulin treatment in fresh or non-infected cultured myocytes but not in myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) (Fig. 2D). The findings indicate that amino acids 562–679 are required for the insulin effect. As shown in Fig. 2D, the insulin effect is still present in wild-type canine NCX1.1-expressing myocytes, indicating that the viral transduction itself did not alter the insulin effect. The current in non-infected cultured myocytes was similar to the current in wild-type NCX1.1-expressing myocytes (at +80 mV ∼3 pA/pF), indicating that the total NCX activity remains constant after the native protein is replaced by viral transduction. Insulin Signaling Pathways—Our next objective was to determine which of the multiplicity of intracellular signaling pathways activated by insulin might be involved in the effect on the INCX. Earlier reports have suggested that a fraction of the NCX may reside in caveolae (27Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar), in which compartment also resides the components of the nitric-oxide synthase pathway. Insulin has been shown to increase nitric oxide production in vascular endothelial cells (11Zeng G. Quon M.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) through a mechanism involving phosphorylation of the synthase by Akt (27Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2994) Google Scholar, 28Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar), which is activated by the PI3-kinase pathway. Therefore, we first investigated whether the insulin effect on INCX in adult cardiomyocytes was altered when the nitric-oxide synthase was inhibited with l-NAME (5 mmol/liter). l-NAME treatment had no effect on basal INCX, and it did not prevent the enhancement of NCX conductance by insulin (Fig. 3). Furthermore, although cholesterol chelation by methyl-β-cyclodextrin has been used previously to disrupt lipid rafts and caveolae to prevent ion channel recruitment to the membrane (26Balijepalli R.C. Foell J.D. Hall D.D. Hell J.W. Kamp T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 7500-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and to disrupt the caveolin-3/NCX protein-protein interaction (16Bossuyt J. Taylor B.E. James-Kracke M. Hale C.C. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 29Bossuyt J. Taylor B.E. James-Kracke M. Hale C.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 976: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), this agent did not significantly affect basal or insulin-stimulated INCX (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4A, cumulative I-V plots from fresh myocytes pretreated for 30 min with 1 mmol/liter methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (1 mmol/liter; n = 9).

Disruption of caveolae did not prevent the insulin effect on both NCX modes. Error bars indicate S.E. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further investigated whether the NCX response was mediated by insulin activation of PI3-kinase by pretreating myocytes with the inhibitor wortmannin (WM). WM significantly enhanced GNCX in the absence of insulin, but the insulin effect on NCX was still present. The maximal GNCX with Ins and WM+Ins were not different (3.2 ± 0.3 and 3.8 ± 0.6 nS, respectively, NS), indicating that the PI3-kinase pathway did not mediate the insulin effect on the NCX (Fig. 5A). Insulin activates phospholipase C to initiate PIP2 hydrolysis, which leads to the activation of PKC. Pretreatment of myocytes with the PKC inhibitor chelerythrine (2.5 μmol/liter) blocked the insulin-mediated increase in GNCX (Fig. 5B). Because PIP2 is a known modulator of NCX activity and is also implicated in both the PI3-K and phospholipase C pathways, we next examined the effects of manipulating the intracellular PIP2 levels on basal and insulin-stimulated INCX. Cells dialyzed with PIP2 (30 or 60 μmol/liter) had larger basal NCX current in the absence of insulin (Fig. 6), confirming that PIP2 is an important modulator of the INCX in adult cardiomyocytes. Whereas 10 μmol/liter PIP2 (data not shown) was insufficient to increase INCX, 30 and 60 μmol/liter PIP2 increased GNCX (Fig. 6C) to similar levels. Moreover, the insulin effect was small with 30 μmol/liter PIP2 and was not significant with 60 μmol/liter PIP2 (Fig. 6, A–C); that is, the stimulatory effect of insulin was not additive to that of PIP2. The effects of insulin on GNCX, expressed as a percent increase of basal values, highlight the effects of the different experimental protocols used in this study (Fig. 7).FIGURE 7Normalized insulin effect on NCX.A, the average increase in GNCX induced by Ins (1 μmol/liter), expressed as percent change from the control, examined in the presence of 1 mmol/liter methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) (n = 9), 5 mmol/liter l-NAME (n = 8), 100 nmol/liter WM (n = 8), or 2.5 μmol/liter chelerythrine (Che) (n = 7). B, bars compare the insulin effect on GNCX in myocytes dialyzed with different PIP2 concentrations (30 or 60 μmol/liter). C, average increase in GNCX in fresh myocytes, non-infected cultured myocytes, cultured myocytes expressing NCX-(Δ562–679) with or without XIP in the pipette solution, and cultured myocytes expressing WT NCX.

Error bars indicate S.E. of the mean.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the present study, we have demonstrated that insulin can increase INCX in native adult ventricular myocytes and in cultured myocytes. Deletion of amino acids 562–679 in the cytoplasmic f-loop of NCX eliminated the insulin response. The insulin effect was not mediated by PI3-kinase activation nor did it involve nitric-oxide synthase activation or recruitment of NCX from caveolae. The insulin-mediated increase in NCX conductance was prevented by inhibition of protein kinase C and was not additive with the stimulatory effect of PIP2 on NCX. NCX in Diabetes and the Effect of Insulin—A decrease in cardiac NCX activity in diabetic animals has been reported by a number of groups (7Hattori Y. Matsuda N. Kimura J. Ishitani T. Tamada A. Gando S. Kemmotsu O. Kanno M. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Makino N. Dhalla K.S. Elimban V. Dhalla N.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: E202-E207PubMed Google Scholar) and has been suggested as a mechanism contributing to diastolic dysfunction and cardiomyopathy in diabetes. In some models, both mRNA and protein levels of NCX are decreased (7Hattori Y. Matsuda N. Kimura J. Ishitani T. Tamada A. Gando S. Kemmotsu O. Kanno M. J. Physiol. 2000; 527: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); however, the role of acute modulation of NCX by insulin and/or high glucose without an effect on NCX mRNA has been suggested to underlie the altered activity in other models (9Schaffer S.W. Ballard-Croft C. Boerth S. Allo S.N. Cardiovasc. Res. 1997; 34: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 30Golfman L. Dixon I.M. Takeda N. Lukas A. Dakshinamurti K. Dhalla N.S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 188: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Direct measurement of the acute effect of insulin on INCX under controlled patch clamp conditions has not been reported previously, but earlier studies have shown that insulin, as well as other agents that induce phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis (31Mene P. Pugliese F. Cinotti G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: F466-F473PubMed Google Scholar), can increase NCX activity within minutes, measured as the Na+-dependent component of 45Ca2+ uptake by sarcolemmal vesicles (32Gupta M.P. Makino N. Khatter K. Dhalla N.S. Life Sci. 1986; 39: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Kato M. Kako K.J. Mol. Cell.

Acute enhancement of NCX activity by insulin (34Ballard C. Mozaffari M. Schaffer S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), platelet-derived growth factor, or insulin-like growth factor (35Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. Hypertension. 1997; 30: 1440-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) can be suppressed by PKC inhibitors. These findings are consistent with the present results showing that PKC inhibition with chelerythrine eliminated the insulin effect on INCX. Enhanced NCX activity has also been indirectly implicated in the positive inotropic effects of insulin on the failing human myocardium (10Hsu C.H. Wei J. Chen Y.C. Yang S.P. Tsai C.S. Lin C.I. J.
