https://openalex.org/W2015053255,"Protecting the world's freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80% of the world's population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2161998322,"A genome-wide association (GWA) study of more than 180,000 individuals has identified hundreds of genetic variants in at least 180 loci associated with adult human height. The loci are not clustered randomly but are enriched for genes involved in growth-related processes that influence adult height. This demonstrates that GWA studies of common human traits, and therefore of many diseases, can identify large numbers of loci that implicate potential causal genes. This very large genome-wide association study identifies hundreds of new genetic variants influencing adult height in at least 180 loci enriched for genes involved in skeletal growth defects. The results show that the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant, that many loci have multiple independently associated variants and that associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes. Most common human traits and diseases have a polygenic pattern of inheritance: DNA sequence variants at many genetic loci influence the phenotype. Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified more than 600 variants associated with human traits1, but these typically explain small fractions of phenotypic variation, raising questions about the use of further studies. Here, using 183,727 individuals, we show that hundreds of genetic variants, in at least 180 loci, influence adult height, a highly heritable and classic polygenic trait2,3. The large number of loci reveals patterns with important implications for genetic studies of common human diseases and traits. First, the 180 loci are not random, but instead are enriched for genes that are connected in biological pathways (P = 0.016) and that underlie skeletal growth defects (P < 0.001). Second, the likely causal gene is often located near the most strongly associated variant: in 13 of 21 loci containing a known skeletal growth gene, that gene was closest to the associated variant. Third, at least 19 loci have multiple independently associated variants, suggesting that allelic heterogeneity is a frequent feature of polygenic traits, that comprehensive explorations of already-discovered loci should discover additional variants and that an appreciable fraction of associated loci may have been identified. Fourth, associated variants are enriched for likely functional effects on genes, being over-represented among variants that alter amino-acid structure of proteins and expression levels of nearby genes. Our data explain approximately 10% of the phenotypic variation in height, and we estimate that unidentified common variants of similar effect sizes would increase this figure to approximately 16% of phenotypic variation (approximately 20% of heritable variation). Although additional approaches are needed to dissect the genetic architecture of polygenic human traits fully, our findings indicate that GWA studies can identify large numbers of loci that implicate biologically relevant genes and pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2021678907,"In eukaryotes, U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) forms spliceosomes in equal stoichiometry with U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs; however, its abundance in human far exceeds that of the other snRNPs. Here we used antisense morpholino oligonucleotide to U1 snRNA to achieve functional U1 snRNP knockdown in HeLa cells, and identified accumulated unspliced pre-mRNAs by genomic tiling microarrays. In addition to inhibiting splicing, U1 snRNP knockdown caused premature cleavage and polyadenylation in numerous pre-mRNAs at cryptic polyadenylation signals, frequently in introns near (<5 kilobases) the start of the transcript. This did not occur when splicing was inhibited with U2 snRNA antisense morpholino oligonucleotide or the U2-snRNP-inactivating drug spliceostatin A unless U1 antisense morpholino oligonucleotide was also included. We further show that U1 snRNA–pre-mRNA base pairing was required to suppress premature cleavage and polyadenylation from nearby cryptic polyadenylation signals located in introns. These findings reveal a critical splicing-independent function for U1 snRNP in protecting the transcriptome, which we propose explains its overabundance."
https://openalex.org/W2053001474,"Traditionally, quantum entanglement has been central to foundational discussions of quantum mechanics. The measurement of correlations between entangled particles can have results at odds with classical behaviour. These discrepancies grow exponentially with the number of entangled particles. With the ample experimental confirmation of quantum mechanical predictions, entanglement has evolved from a philosophical conundrum into a key resource for technologies such as quantum communication and computation. Although entanglement in superconducting circuits has been limited so far to two qubits, the extension of entanglement to three, eight and ten qubits has been achieved among spins, ions and photons, respectively. A key question for solid-state quantum information processing is whether an engineered system could display the multi-qubit entanglement necessary for quantum error correction, which starts with tripartite entanglement. Here, using a circuit quantum electrodynamics architecture, we demonstrate deterministic production of three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states with fidelity of 88 per cent, measured with quantum state tomography. Several entanglement witnesses detect genuine three-qubit entanglement by violating biseparable bounds by 830 ± 80 per cent. We demonstrate the first step of basic quantum error correction, namely the encoding of a logical qubit into a manifold of GHZ-like states using a repetition code. The integration of this encoding with decoding and error-correcting steps in a feedback loop will be the next step for quantum computing with integrated circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2023398724,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in humans and will on average affect up to one in eight women in their lifetime in the United States and Europe. The Women's Health Initiative and the Million Women Study have shown that hormone replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk of incident and fatal breast cancer. In particular, synthetic progesterone derivatives (progestins) such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), used in millions of women for hormone replacement therapy and contraceptives, markedly increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Here we show that the in vivo administration of MPA triggers massive induction of the key osteoclast differentiation factor RANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) in mammary-gland epithelial cells. Genetic inactivation of the RANKL receptor RANK in mammary-gland epithelial cells prevents MPA-induced epithelial proliferation, impairs expansion of the CD49f(hi) stem-cell-enriched population, and sensitizes these cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death. Deletion of RANK from the mammary epithelium results in a markedly decreased incidence and delayed onset of MPA-driven mammary cancer. These data show that the RANKL/RANK system controls the incidence and onset of progestin-driven breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2166473014,"Superconductivity and magnetism generally do not coexist. Changing the relative number of up and down spin electrons disrupts the basic mechanism of superconductivity, where atoms of opposite momentum and spin form Cooper pairs. Nearly forty years ago Fulde and Ferrell and Larkin and Ovchinnikov proposed an exotic pairing mechanism (FFLO) where magnetism is accommodated by formation of pairs with finite momentum. Despite intense theoretical and experimental efforts, however, polarized superconductivity remains largely elusive. Here we report experimental measurements of density profiles of a two spin mixture of ultracold 6Li atoms trapped in an array of one dimensional (1D) tubes, a system analogous to electrons in 1D wires. At finite spin imbalance, the system phase separates with an inverted phase profile in comparison to the three-dimensional case. In 1D we find a partially polarized core surrounded by wings composed of either a completely paired BCS superfluid or a fully polarized Fermi gas, depending on the degree of polarization. Our observations are in quantitative agreement with theoretical calculations in which the partially polarized phase is found to be a 1D analogue of the FFLO state. This study demonstrates how ultracold atomic gases in 1D may be used to create non-trivial new phases of matter, and also paves the way for direct observation and further study of the FFLO phase."
https://openalex.org/W1981981290,"Most antibodies are highly specific, binding with high affinity to a single foreign antigen. However, an analysis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein-specific monoclonal antibodies from infected subjects provides evidence for a surprisingly high degree of polyreactivity. Of 134 different antibodies directed at the gp140 envelope glycoprotein cloned from six patients, 75% were polyreactive, binding with high affinity to one gp140 site and with lower affinity to other sites on the viral surface. Relatively few gp140 glycoprotein spikes are displayed on the surface of HIV, so homotypic bivalent antibody binding is disfavoured and 'heteroligation' may help to improve net antibody affinity in such instances. During immune responses, antibodies are selected for their ability to bind to foreign antigens with high affinity, in part by their ability to undergo homotypic bivalent binding. However, this type of binding is not always possible. Here, the monoclonal antibodies produced in two infected subjects in response to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) glycoprotein have been analysed. The results provide evidence for polyreactivity, which may be required when the density of glycoprotein spikes is so low that bivalent binding is unlikely. During immune responses, antibodies are selected for their ability to bind to foreign antigens with high affinity, in part by their ability to undergo homotypic bivalent binding. However, this type of binding is not always possible. For example, the small number of gp140 glycoprotein spikes displayed on the surface of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disfavours homotypic bivalent antibody binding1,2,3. Here we show that during the human antibody response to HIV, somatic mutations that increase antibody affinity also increase breadth and neutralizing potency. Surprisingly, the responding naive and memory B cells produce polyreactive antibodies, which are capable of bivalent heteroligation between one high-affinity anti-HIV-gp140 combining site and a second low-affinity site on another molecular structure on HIV. Although cross-reactivity to self-antigens or polyreactivity is strongly selected against during B-cell development4, it is a common serologic feature of certain infections in humans, including HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and hepatitis C virus. Seventy-five per cent of the 134 monoclonal anti-HIV-gp140 antibodies cloned from six patients5 with high titres of neutralizing antibodies are polyreactive. Despite the low affinity of the polyreactive combining site, heteroligation demonstrably increases the apparent affinity of polyreactive antibodies to HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2117997131,"Quantum entanglement, in which the states of two or more particles are inextricably linked, is a key requirement for quantum computation. In superconducting devices, two-qubit entangled states have been used to implement simple quantum algorithms. The availability of three-qubit states, which can be entangled in two fundamentally different ways (the GHZ and W states), would be a significant advance because they should make it possible to perform error correction and infer scalability to the higher numbers of qubits needed for a practical quantum-information-processing device. Two groups now report the generation of three-qubit entanglement. John Martinis and colleagues create and measure both GHZ and W-type states. Leonardo DiCarlo and colleagues generate the GHZ state and demonstrate the first step of basic quantum error correction by encoding a logical qubit into a manifold of GHZ-like states using a repetition code. Quantum entanglement is one of the key resources required for quantum computation. In superconducting devices, two-qubit entangled states have been used to implement simple quantum algorithms, but three-qubit states, which can be entangled in two fundamentally different ways, have not been demonstrated. Here, however, three superconducting phase qubits have been used to create and measure these two entangled three-qubit states. Entanglement is one of the key resources required for quantum computation1, so the experimental creation and measurement of entangled states is of crucial importance for various physical implementations of quantum computers2. In superconducting devices3, two-qubit entangled states have been demonstrated and used to show violations of Bell’s inequality4 and to implement simple quantum algorithms5. Unlike the two-qubit case, where all maximally entangled two-qubit states are equivalent up to local changes of basis, three qubits can be entangled in two fundamentally different ways6. These are typified by the states |GHZ〉 = (|000〉 + |111〉)/ and |W〉 = (|001〉 + |010〉 + |100〉)/ . Here we demonstrate the operation of three coupled superconducting phase qubits7 and use them to create and measure |GHZ〉 and |W〉 states. The states are fully characterized using quantum state tomography8 and are shown to satisfy entanglement witnesses9, confirming that they are indeed examples of three-qubit entanglement and are not separable into mixtures of two-qubit entanglement."

https://openalex.org/W2001824102,"Methylating drugs such as temozolomide (TMZ) are widely used in the treatment of brain tumors including malignant glioblastoma. The mechanism of TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis, however, is not fully understood. Here, we tested the potential involvement of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in this process. We found that methylating agents TMZ and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induce AMPK activation in primary cultured human glioblastoma and glioblastoma cell lines. TMZ-induced O6-methylguanine production is involved in AMPK activation. O6-benzylguanine, an O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, enhances TMZ-induced O6-methylguanine production, leading to enhanced reactive oxygen species production, which serves as an upstream signal for AMPK activation. Activation of AMPK is involved in TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis. AMPK inhibitor (Compound C) or AMPKα siRNA knockdown inhibits TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis, whereas AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside enhances it. In further studies, we found that activation of AMPK is involved in TMZ-induced p53 activation and subsequent p21, Noxa, and Bax up-regulation. Activation of AMPK by TMZ also inhibits mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and promotes anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 down-regulation, which together mediate TMZ-induced pro-cell apoptosis effects. Our study suggests that activation of AMPK by TMZ contributes to glioblastoma cell apoptosis, probably by promoting p53 activation and inhibiting mTORC1 signaling.

Astrocytic tumors are the most common primary brain tumors. Of the astrocytic tumors, malignant glioblastoma is the most malignant form and has the worst prognosis. Complete surgical resection of glioblastoma is difficult, and the tumor generally recurs within a year after radiation and chemotherapy regardless of the initial response to these treatment modalities (1Conrad C.A. Milosavljevic V.P. Yung W.K. Neurol. Clin. 1995; 13: 795-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Despite the use of O6-methylating agents (TMZ for example) in glioblastoma therapy, the median survival times of patients suffering from the most severe form glioblastoma are still remarkably low (12–14 months). There is an urgent need for improving glioblastoma therapy. One goal that needs to be reached in achieving this would be to improve our knowledge of the mechanism of alkylating agent-induced death in glioblastoma cells (2Roos W.P. Batista L.F. Naumann S.C.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic-sensing protein kinase, which plays an essential role as an energy-sensor mainly in ATP-deprived conditions (10Hardie D.G. Carling D. Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 821-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). In the activated states, AMPK down-regulates several anabolic enzymes and thus shuts down the ATP-consuming metabolic pathways. Interestingly, several recent reports have observed the strong pro-apoptotic potential of AMPK in activated conditions such as AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR)-treated cells or constitutively active AMPK mutant (3Garcia-Gil M.

Interestingly, certain chemotherapy drugs can also activates AMPK, mediating pro-cell death and apoptosis effects (12Ji, C., Yang, B., Yang, Y. L., He, S. H., Miao, D. S., He, L., Bi, Z. G. (2010) Oncogene, in press.Google Scholar). For example, a recent paper suggests that AMPK activation is a key player for doxorubicin-induced cancer cell apoptosis (12Ji, C., Yang, B., Yang, Y. L., He, S. H., Miao, D. S., He, L., Bi, Z. G. (2010) Oncogene, in press.Google Scholar). However, the potential effects of AMPK activation on TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis have not been studied. Here, we found for the first time that methylating agents TMZ and N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induce AMPK activation in both primary cultured human glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma cell lines, which mediates cell death and apoptosis. We found that activation of AMPK is involved in TMZ-induced p53 activation and mTORC1 inhibition. AKT1, T-S6K, AMPKα1, AMPKα2, TSC1 (Hamartin), TSC2 (Tuberin), Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, p21, p53, AKT, ERK1/2, LKB1, goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, and goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Compound C, rapamycin, and AICAR were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG), TMZ, MNNG, monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin, H2O2, and N-acetylcysteine (NAc) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). T-AMPKα and all phosphorylation antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Bevery, MA). Glioblastoma U87MG and U373MG cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with a 10% FBS (Sigma), penicillin/streptomycin (1:100; Sigma) and 4 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Following informed consent, tumor samples classified as glioblastoma based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria were obtained from patients undergoing surgical treatment at Brain Hospital affiliated with Nanjing Medical University. Within 1–3 h after surgical removal, tumors were washed and enzymatically dissociated into single cells. Red blood cells were removed by differential centrifugation. Tumor cells were then cultured serum medium consisting of DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) with basic FGF and EGF (50 ng/ml each; Calbiochem). The culture dish and plates were precoated with poly-l-lysine/laminin mixture (Invitrogen). Cell viability was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method. Briefly, cells were collected and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/cm2. Different seeding densities were optimized at the beginning of the experiments. 20 μl of MTT tetrazolium salt (Sigma) dissolved in Hanks' balanced solution at a concentration of 5 mg/ml was added to each well with the indicated treatment and incubated in CO2 incubator for 4 h. Finally, the medium was aspirated from each well, and 150 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was added to dissolve formazan crystals, and the absorbance of each well was obtained using a Dynatech MR5000 plate reader at a test wavelength of 490 nm with a reference wavelength of 630 nm. Aliquots of 40 μg of protein from each sample were separated by 10–12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). After blocking with 10% instant nonfat dry milk for 1 h, membranes were incubated with specific antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 1 h. Antibody binding was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). U87MG cells treated with the appropriate stimuli were treated with lysis buffer, 200 mm NaCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.3 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Sciences). Aliquots of 800 μg of proteins from each sample were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose (beads) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared samples were incubated with primary antibodies in lysis buffer overnight at 4 °C. To this was added 35 μl of protein A/G beads, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and once with lysis buffer, boiled, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane followed by Western blotting analysis. To detect apoptotic cells, cells were stained with DNA dye Hoechst 33342 (Sigma). Cells with the indicated treatment were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 to stain the nuclei for 5 min. After washing with PBS, the apoptotic cells were observed under a confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica TCS SMD FCS, Leica, Germany). Cells exhibiting condensed chromatin nuclei (Hoechst 33342 stain, Blue) were scored as apoptotic cells. For each Hoechst experiment, at least 100 cells in five random scope fields were counted for apoptotic rate. The Cell Apoptosis ELISA Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to detect apoptosis in glioblastoma cell lines with different treatments according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, after the indicated treatments, the cytoplasmic histone/DNA fragments from cells were extracted and bound to immobilized anti-histone antibody. Subsequently, the peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody was used for the detection of immobilized histone/DNA fragments. After the addition of substrate for peroxidase, the spectrophotometric absorbance of the samples was determined by using Dynatech MR5000 plate reader at 405 nM. siRNA for AMPKα1/α2 (sc-45312), LKB1 (sc-35816), ATM (sc-29761), and Bcl-2 (sc-29214) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. SignalSilence® mTOR siRNA was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. U87MG or primary cultured glioblastoma cells were cultured and seeded in a 6-well plate 1 day prior to transfection and cultured to 70% confluence the following day. For RNAi experiments, 3.2 μl of PLUS™ Reagent (Invitrogen) was diluted in 90 μl of RNA dilution water (Invitrogen) for 5 min in room temperature. Then, 10 μl of siRNA (10 μm) or control (scramble) siRNA (10 μm) was added to the PLUS™ Reagent and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 3.6 μl of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) was then added to the complex. After a 30-min incubation, the transfection complex was formed. Finally, the complex was added to the wells containing 1 ml of medium with the final siRNA concentration of 100 nm. Target protein expression was determined by Western blotting 48 h after transfection, successfully knocked down cells were used for further experiments. Human TSC1 (sc-37437-SH)/TSC2 (sc-36762-SH) and p53 shRNA (sc-29435-sh) plasmids were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. U87MG cells were cultured and seeded in a 6-well plate 1 day prior to transfection and cultured to 70% confluence the following day. For shRNA experiments, 3.2 μl of PLUS™ Reagent was diluted in 90 μl of RNA dilution water for 5 min in room temperature. Then, 2 μg of plasmid or 2 μg of control plasmid was added to the PLUS™ Reagent and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. 3.6 μl of Lipofectamine was then added to the complex. After a 30-min incubation, the transfection complex was formed and added to U87MG cells. Cells were then cultured for additional 48 h, followed by puromycin (0.5 μm) selection. TSC2/TSC1 or p53 expression was detected by Western blotting 48 h later. Successfully transfected stable cells were cultured and stored for further experiments. Cultured U87MG cells were loaded with 1 μm fluorescent dye dihydrorhodamine 2 h before treatment, which reacts with ROS in cells and results in a change of fluorescence. After the indicated treatments, U87MG cells were trypsinized, suspended in ice-cold PBS, and fixed in 70% ethyl alcohol at −20 °C. The changes in fluorescence in drug-treated cells were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Induction of ROS generation was expressed in arbitrary units (versus control). The values in the figures are expressed as the means ± S.D. The figures in this study are representative of at least three independent experiments. Values of p < 0.05 were considered as statistically significant (ANOVA) with a Newman-Keuls post test. First, we tested the possible effect of TMZ on AMPK activation in cultured glioblastoma cells. Essential to activation of AMPK is its phosphorylation at Thr-172 by an upstream kinase LKB1 (13Shaw R.J. Kosmatka M. Bardeesy N. Hurley R.L. Witters L.A. DePinho R.A. Cantley L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 3329-3335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). LKB1 is activated allosterically by binding to the pseudokinase STRAD and the adaptor protein MO25. The LKB1-STRAD-MO25 heterotrimeric complex represents the biologically active unit that is capable of phosphorylates and activates AMPK. Phosphorylation of LKB at Ser-428 influences the ability of LKB1 to bind and phosphorylate AMPK at Thr-172 (14Xie Z. Dong Y. Zhang M. Cui M.Z. Cohen R.A. Riek U. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Zou M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6366-6375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). After AMPK activation, AMPK phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser-79) (15Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 1996; 270: E299-E304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is well established as a key indicator for AMPK activity. As shown in Fig. 1, A–D, in two different glioblastoma cell lines (U87MG and U373MG), TMZ clearly induced AMPK and its upstream molecular LKB1 and downstream molecular ACC phosphorylation in a both time- and dose-dependent manner. As expected, TMZ induced U87MG cell death (Fig. 1H, reduced cell viability, MTT assay) and cell apoptosis (Fig. 1, E–G) in a dose-dependent manner, the cell apoptosis was confirmed by two different methods including Hoechst 33342 assay (Fig. 1, E and F) and histone/DNA ELISA (Fig. 1G). Importantly, TMZ also induced strong AMPK activation in primary cultured human glioblastoma cells in a both dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, I and J). As shown in Fig. 1, TMZ induced strong AMPK activation in cultured glioblastoma cells. Further, MNNG, another DNA-methylating agent, was also able to induce AMPK activation (Fig. 2A). We then tested the possible upstream signals for AMPK activation by TMZ. Previous studies have identified ROS as strong AMPK activators (16Kim D.S. Woo E.R. Chae S.W. Ha K.C. Lee G.H. Hong S.T. Kwon D.Y. Kim M.S. Jung Y.K. Kim H.M. Kim H.K. Kim H.R. Chae H.J. Life Sci. 2007; 80: 314-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J.F. Liu J.J. Lu M.Q. Cai C.J. Yang Y. Li H. Xu C.

Signal. 2007; 19: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), so we next tested the possible involvement of ROS production in TMZ-induced AMPK activation. As shown in Fig, 2C, TMZ induced ROS production in U87MG cells, NAc, an antioxidant, largely inhibited TMZ-induced ROS production and AMPK activation (Fig. 2, C and F). As expected, direct H2O2 treatment induced strong AMPK activation; so did the AMPK activator AICAR (Fig. 2D). Here, we suggest that ROS production that leads to AMPK activation by TMZ is associated with induction of DNA damage. To support this, we found that O6-BG, an O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inhibitor, which is reportedly to enhance TMZ-induced O6-MeG production (the lethal DNA damage by TMZ) (2Roos W.P. Batista L.F. Naumann S.C. Wick W. Weller M. Menck C.F. Kaina B. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 19Preuss I. Thust R. Kaina B. Int. J. Cancer. 1996; 65: 506-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 20Kaina B. Fritz G. Mitra S. Coquerelle T. Carcinogenesis. 1991; 12: 1857-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), caused enhanced ROS generation and downstream AMPK activation (Fig. 2, B and C). Further, the other DNA-methylating agent MNNG was also able to induce ROS production and AMPK activation, which was also enhanced by O6-BG (Fig. 2, A–C). So, we indicate that TMZ causes DNA damage which leads to ROS production, the latter serving as an upstream signal for AMPK activation. Knockdown of LKB1 by specific siRNA reduced TMZ-induced AMPK activation, indicating that LKB1 might be the upstream signal for AMPK activation in response to TMZ (Fig. 2E). Importantly, NAc and Compound C, which inhibited TMZ-induced AMPK activation (Fig. 2F), also inhibited TMZ-induced cell death (reduced cell viability) and apoptosis (detected by Hoechst staining and histone/DNA ELISA) (Fig. 2, G–J). Further, knockdown of the upstream signal LKB1 also diminished TMZ-induced cell death and apoptosis (Fig. 2, K–M). These results indicated that AMPK activation might be involved in TMZ-induced cell death/apoptosis in cultured glioblastoma cells. To confirm further that AMPK activation is involved in TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death/apoptosis, AMPKα siRNA was used. As shown in Fig. 3A, AMPKα1/2 siRNAs efficiently knocked down both AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 in cultured U87MG cells, whereas control (scramble) siRNA had almost no effect on AMPKα1/2 expression. TMZ-induced cell death and apoptosis were largely inhibited in AMPKα1/2 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, B–E). However, enforced AMPK activation by AICAR enhanced TMZ-induced cell death and apoptosis in cultured U87MG cells (Fig. 3, F and G). Importantly, knockdown of AMPKα1/2 by specific siRNAs in primary cultured glioblastoma cells (Fig. 3H) also inhibited TMZ-induced cell death and apoptosis (Fig. 3, I and J). Taking these results into account, we suggest that AMPK activation is involved in TMZ-induced cell apoptosis in cultured glioblastoma cells. Because we have showed that TMZ induces AMPK activation, which contributes to glioblastoma cell death and apoptosis (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3), we next tried to identity the downstream targets of AMPK activation. We first focused on p53 because p53 is a key mediator for TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell death (2Roos W.P. Batista L.F. Naumann S.C. Wick W. Weller M. Menck C.F. Kaina B.

As shown in Fig. 4A, TMZ-induced p53 phosphorylation (at serine 15) and up-regulation/stabilization in U87MG cells. p21 and pro-apoptotic proteins Noxa and Bax were also induced after TMZ treatment (Fig. 4A). To confirm further the requirement of p53 to TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell apoptosis, we generated a p53 knockdown stable U87MG cell by introducing a p53 shRNA plasmid to wild-type U87MG cells through the methods mentioned above (Fig. 4B). TMZ-induced cell death and apoptosis were largely inhibited in the shRNA-transfected low p53 expression stable U87MG cells (Fig. 4, K and L), again supporting that requirement of p53 for TMZ-induced cell apoptosis. Further, p53 knockdown by shRNA largely inhibited TMZ-induced p21 and Noxa/Bax expression, suggesting that p21/Noxa/Bax was induced in a p53-dependent manner after TMZ treatment (Fig. 4B). Importantly, inhibition of the activation of AMPK by Compound C (Fig. 4C) and AMPKα1/2 siRNAs (Fig. 4D) efficiently reduced TMZ-induced p53 activation (phosphorylation at Ser-15 and accumulation) as well as downstream p21/Noxa/Bax induction (Fig. 4, C and D), indicating that activation of AMPK is involved in TMZ-induced p53 activation. We then tested whether there was a direct link between AMPK and p53 in TMZ-treated glioblastoma cells by using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, and we found that AMPKα formed a complex with p53, where AMPK directly phosphorylates p53 (Ser-15) after TMZ or AICAR treatment (Fig. 4, E–I). Notably, AICAR and H2O2, two other AMPK activation agents, were also able to induce p53 activation, which was also inhibited by AMPK siRNA (Fig. 4J). Importantly, the induction of p53/p21 by TMZ was also inhibited by AMPKα1/2 siRNA knockdown in primary cultured human glioblastoma cells (Fig. 5J). Taking all of these results into account, we suggest that TMZ induces AMPK activation, activated AMPK directly binds to and phosphorylates p53, and activated p53 then mediates glioma cell apoptosis, probably by regulation the expression of its downstream target proteins including p21, Noxa, and Bax.FIGURE 5AMPK activation mediates TMZ-induced mTORC1 inhibition in vitro. A, glioblastoma U87MG cells were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for the indicated times. p-S6K (Thr-389), p-4E-BP1 (Ser-65), p-S6 (Ser-235/236), T-AMPKα, and AKT1 were detected. B, U87MG cells transfected with scramble (Ctrl) or AMPKα1/2 siRNA were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for 24 h. p-4E-BP1 (Ser-65), p-S6 (Ser-235/236), and relative loading controls were detected.

D, U87MG cells were transfected with TSC2/TSC1 shRNA for 48 h. Successfully transfected cells were selected by puromycin. After selection, cells were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for 24 h. p-4E-BP1 (Ser-65), p-S6 (Ser-235/236), TSC1, TSC2, and AKT1 were detected. E, glioblastoma U87MG cells were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for the indicated times. Bcl-2 expression was detected by Western blotting. F, U87MG cells were treated with rapamycin (100 nm) for 12 h. mTOR, p-S6K (Thr-389), p-S6 (Ser-235/236), p-AKT (Ser-473), AKT1, and Bcl-2 were detected. G, U87MG cells were transfected with scramble (Ctrl) or mTOR siRNA for 48 h. mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser-2448), p-S6K (Thr-389), p-AKT (Ser-473), AKT1, and Bcl-2 were detected. H, U87MG cells transfected with control (scramble) or AMPKα1/2 siRNA were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for 48 h. The expression levels of AMPKα1/2, Bcl-2, and β-actin were detected. I, U87MG cells were pretreated with Compound C (CC, 10 μm) for 2 h, followed by 250 μm TMZ treatment for 48 h. Bcl-2 and β-actin were detected. The effects of AICAR (1 mm) and H2O2 (250 μm, 24 h) on Bcl-2 expression were also detected. J, primary cultured human glioblastoma cells transfected with control (scramble) or AMPKα1/2 siRNA were treated with TMZ (250 μm) for 48 h. The expression levels of AMPKα1/2, AMPKβ, p53, p21, Bcl-2, and p-S6K as well as loading control β-actin were detected. K and L, U87MG cells were pretreated with rapamycin (100 nm) for 2 h, followed by 250 μm TMZ treatment. Cell viability (48 h later) was detected by MTT assay. Cell apoptosis (36 h later) was detected by histone/DNA ELISA. M, U87MG cells were transfected with scramble (Ctrl), mTOR, or Bcl-2 siRNA for 48 h followed by TMZ (250 μm) treatment for another 48 h. Cell viability was detected by MTT assay. N, proposed signal pathway involved in this study is shown. TMZ induces AMPK activation in glioblastoma cells, DNA damage caused by TMZ plays an important role in ROS production and following LKB1/AMPK activation. Activation of AMPK contributes TMZ-induced glioblastoma cell apoptosis, probably by regulating p53 (positively) and mTORC1 (negatively) pathways as well as altering the expression of apoptosis-associated proteins, including p21, Bax, Noxa, and Bcl-2. In addition to AMPK, ATM and possible other DNA repair proteins may also be involved in p53 activation by TMZ.

Mice with a liver-specific FoxO1 deletion (L-FoxO1) show reduced HGP and reduced expression of glucose production genes. To determine the contribution of additional transcription factors to HGP, we created double and triple liver-specific knock-outs lacking FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 or the related protein FoxA2. We show that, when compared with single knock-out of FoxO1, triple ablation of FoxO genes causes more pronounced fasting hypoglycemia, increased glucose tolerance, and enhanced insulin sensitivity, with decreased plasma insulin levels. In contrast, combined ablation of FoxO1 and FoxA2 phenocopied the single knock-out of FoxO1. These data indicate that FoxOs work in concert to regulate multiple aspects of hepatic glucose metabolism.

Blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range under physiological circumstances, partly by the action of hormones to stimulate or inhibit glucose production, which occurs mainly in liver (1Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1198-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Hepatic glucose production (HGP) 2The abbreviations used are: HGPhepatic glucose productionGTTglucose tolerance testqPCRquantitative PCRAUCarea under the curve. is a combination of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, and although it is generally accepted that HGP is high in patients with diabetes, the physiology of this abnormality remains disputed (2Nuttall F.Q.

FoxO1 is a transcription factor that confers hormone sensitivity onto HGP (5Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1359-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, FoxO1 interacts with coactivator Pgc1α to promote the expression of gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic genes including glucose-6-phosphatase (6Puigserver P. Rhee J. Donovan J. Walkey C.J. Yoon J.C. Oriente F. Kitamura Y. Altomonte J. Dong H. Accili D. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2003; 423: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). This activity is blocked by insulin through the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway, wherein phosphorylation of FoxO1 by Akt causes its nuclear exclusion and inactivation (7Nakae J. Park B.C. Accili D. J. Biol.

Fittingly, FoxO1 haplo-insufficiency or hepatic expression of dominant negative FoxO1 in mice reduces glucogenetic gene expression and rescues the diabetic phenotype of insulin resistance (8Nakae J.

Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Moreover, hepatic FoxO1 ablation in mice lacking either the insulin receptor or the insulin receptor substrates IRS1 and IRS2 rescues the diabetic phenotypes of these mice (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A.

L-FoxO1 mice demonstrate that FoxO1 plays a physiological role in the regulation of HGP by hormones. It remains unclear whether residual HGP in L-FoxO1 mice reflects non-hormonal (basal) glucose turnover or whether there is another hormone-regulated component that is dependent on additional transcription factors. Candidates include Crtc2 (Torc2), FoxA2, and other FoxOs (12Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 13Koo S.H.

Although ablations of transcription factors such as C/Ebpα or Fxr cause low HGP, these proteins are not regulated by cAMP or insulin signaling and appear to control basal, as opposed to hormone-dependent, rates of HGP (14Ma K.

Surviving L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice, as well as L-FoxO1,O3 mice, which were born at expected ratios, had no gross abnormalities, nor differences in body weight, when compared with littermate controls. To identify any compensatory changes in FoxO expression due to deletion of other family members, we examined FoxO mRNAs. Knock-outs showed >90% reduced expression of the expected mRNAs (Fig. 1), without changes in FoxO3 or FoxO4 expression in L-FoxO1 mice when compared with controls. In L-FoxO1,O3 mice, FoxO4 was slightly decreased. L-FoxO1 mice have a defect in HGP initiation at birth, when pups are first required to maintain their own glycemia, by inducing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (26Hume R. Burchell A. Williams F.L. Koh D.K. Early Hum. Dev. 2005; 81: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); this manifests as fasting hypoglycemia (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). We found that L-FoxO1 mice, as reported (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), have lower glucose at postnatal day 2 when compared with littermate controls (Fig. 2A). L-FoxO1,O3 mice showed a similar phenotype. L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice had a more profound defect in postnatal HGP, with 58% lower glucose when compared with littermate controls (p < 0.001). We noted differences in glucose and insulin levels between control groups from different strains; these are likely due to the mixed genetic backgrounds, which are known to affect glucose metabolism and insulin levels (27Toye A.A. Lippiat J.D. Proks P. Shimomura K. Bentley L. Hugill A. Mijat V. Goldsworthy M. Moir L. Haynes A. Quarterman J. Freeman H.C. Ashcroft F.M. Cox R.D.

However, even considering the genetic contribution from background strain, it is clear that triple FoxO ablation causes hypoglycemia to an extent not seen in any of the single knock-outs. Single and compound FoxO knock-outs also showed relative hypoglycemia as adults (p < 0.05). However, this phenotype was extremely variable because of potential extrahepatic contributions to this process and genetic background effects. We measured ad libitum fed and 5-h fasted insulin levels (Fig. 2B). L-FoxO1 mice showed a trend toward reduced fed insulin, and L-FoxO1,O3 mice showed a magnification of this phenotype, with fed insulin around half that of littermate controls. L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice had even more dramatically reduced insulin, 66% lower than controls (p < 0.01), and also had lower insulin after a 5-h fast (p < 0.05). Notably, although all other control and knock-out strains showed higher insulin during ad libitum feeding than after a 5-h fast, L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice appear to have minimal differences in insulin between fed and fasted states. This suggests exquisite insulin sensitivity. We found that, as reported (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), L-FoxO1 mice have improved glucose tolerance, with an 18% decrease in area under the curve (AUC) (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2, C and D). The magnitude of this phenotype was doubled in L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice, with a 37% decrease in AUC when compared with controls (p < 0.0001). L-FoxO1,O3 mice showed an intermediate phenotype. To directly compare knock-out strains, we calculated the AUC for each mouse, relative to the mean AUC of same strain littermates. Analysis by one-way analysis of variance revealed that L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice have improved glucose tolerance when compared with both L-FoxO1 and L-FoxO1,O3 (Fig. 2D). It has been suggested that transcription factor FoxA2 is regulated similarly to FoxO1 (29Wolfrum C. Besser D. Luca E. Stoffel M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11624-11629Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) and that it has a role in HGP (12Wolfrum C. Asilmaz E. Luca E. Friedman J.M. Stoffel M. Nature. 2004; 432: 1027-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 30Wang J.C. Stafford J.M. Scott D.K. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14717-14721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), although mice lacking hepatic FoxA2 have no defects in glucose metabolism (25Sund N.J. Ang S.L. Sackett S.D. Shen W. Daigle N. Magnuson M.A. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5175-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether FoxA2 contributed to HGP similarly to FoxOs, we crossed L-FoxO1 mice with those bearing FoxA2lox/lox alleles (25Sund N.J. Ang S.L. Sackett S.D. Shen W. Daigle N. Magnuson M.A. Kaestner K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5175-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Unlike L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice, however, L-FoxO1,A2 mice showed no difference in GTT when compared with L-FoxO1 (Fig. 2D). These mice also showed no difference in insulin levels (Fig. 2B), indicating no enhancement of insulin sensitivity. These data confirm that FoxA2 does not contribute significantly to HGP. Next, we measured the expression of genes involved in glucose homeostasis (Fig. 3). Glucose-6-phosphatase (encoded by G6pc), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (encoded by Pck1), and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (encoded by Igfbp1) are reported FoxO1 targets, and we found them down-regulated in L-FoxO1 mice, as reported (10Matsumoto M. Pocai A. Rossetti L. Depinho R.A. Accili D. Cell Metab. 2007; 6: 208-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). However, these genes were not further down-regulated in double and triple FoxO knock-outs, and in some cases, these genes were expressed at normal levels. Liver pyruvate kinase (encoded by Pklr) was also normal in all three strains, as was pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-4 (encoded by Pdk4), although it showed a trend toward up-regulation. In contrast, glucokinase (encoded by Gck) was slightly elevated in L-FoxO1 and L-FoxO1,O3 mice and was induced 3-fold in L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice, suggesting that the further reduction in glucose output in these mice is due to a combination of reduced gluconeogenesis and rapid metabolism of glucose into glucose-6-phosphate. The ability of FoxO1 to promote HGP through increased expression of glucogenetic genes has been confirmed extensively (5Nakae J. Kitamura T. Silver D.L. Accili D. J. Clin.

FoxO3 and FoxO4, however, have not previously been reported to be involved in this pathway, and no glucose metabolism defects have been described in either FoxO3−/− or FoxO4−/− mice (23Hosaka T. Biggs 3rd, W.H. Tieu D. Boyer A.D. Varki N.M. Cavenee W.K. Arden K.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2975-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Thus the discovery of their role in HGP was somewhat unexpected. Furthermore, FoxO4 is X-linked, and our studies were limited to males, indicating that even a single FoxO allele is sufficient to sustain FoxO activity. This intimates a multipartite system of redundancy to ensure normal HGP. Our observations reveal that the most profound effects occur with knock-out of all three FoxOs, similar to other FoxO effects (21Paik J.H. Kollipara R. Chu G. Ji H. Xiao Y. Ding Z. Miao L. Tothova Z. Horner J.W. Carrasco D.R. Jiang S. Gilliland D.G. Chin L. Wong W.H. Castrillon D.H. DePinho R.A. Cell. 2007; 128: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). However, we have not studied FoxO1,O4 double knockouts; thus we cannot rule out that the products of these two genes predominate over glucose homeostasis. It is also interesting that compound FoxO knock-outs do not necessarily display further decreases in canonical FoxO1 targets. Instead, these mice demonstrate that some targets, such as G6pc and Igfbp1, may be preferentially regulated by FoxO1, whereas other targets that contribute to glucose homeostasis are regulated redundantly by multiple FoxOs. Gck is regulated by insulin through an unclear mechanism (32Iynedjian P.B. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 27-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), although FoxO1 has been suggested as a repressor (33Ganjam G.K. Dimova E.Y. Unterman T.G. Kietzmann T. J. Biol.

Our observation that Gck is up-regulated in L-FoxO1,O3,O4 mice supports the possibility that FoxOs act redundantly to maintain its levels or that Gck may be a target of FoxO4 specifically.

It has proven difficult to observe NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals free of their presumed interactions with conventional intracellular Ca2+ channels in the ER. The inaccessibility of intracellular NAADP-sensitive channels to patch clamp recording has further limited opportunities to resolve directly their biophysical properties. Here, we address these issues by mutating a lysosomal targeting sequence in TPC2. This redirects TPC2 to the plasma membrane, where it is both uncoupled from ryanodine receptors and accessible to electrophysiological analysis.CONCLUSIONSBy manipulating an endogenous endo-lysosomal targeting sequence near the N terminus of TPC2, we succeeded in expressing TPC2 in the plasma membrane. This allowed us to dissociate activation of TPC2 by NAADP from amplification of the initial Ca2+ signal by Ca2+ release from the ER, thereby demonstrating that ryanodine receptors are not the primary targets of NAADP. Our single-channel recordings and mutagenesis demonstrate that TPC2 is a pore-forming subunit of a Ca2+-permeable channel activated by NAADP.

It has proven difficult to observe NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals free of their presumed interactions with conventional intracellular Ca2+ channels in the ER. The inaccessibility of intracellular NAADP-sensitive channels to patch clamp recording has further limited opportunities to resolve directly their biophysical properties. Here, we address these issues by mutating a lysosomal targeting sequence in TPC2. This redirects TPC2 to the plasma membrane, where it is both uncoupled from ryanodine receptors and accessible to electrophysiological analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1977549744,"The calnexin cycle is a process by which glycosylated proteins are subjected to folding cycles in the endoplasmic reticulum lumen via binding to the membrane protein calnexin (CNX) or to its soluble homolog calreticulin (CRT). CNX and CRT specifically recognize monoglucosylated Glc(1)Man(9)GlcNAc(2) glycans, but the structural determinants underlying this specificity are unknown. Here, we report a 1.95-Å crystal structure of the CRT lectin domain in complex with the tetrasaccharide α-Glc-(1→3)-α-Man-(1→2)-α-Man-(1→2)-Man. The tetrasaccharide binds to a long channel on CRT formed by a concave β-sheet. All four sugar moieties are engaged in the protein binding via an extensive network of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts. The structure explains the requirement for glucose at the nonreducing end of the carbohydrate; the oxygen O(2) of glucose perfectly fits to a pocket formed by CRT side chains while forming direct hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl of Gly(124) and the side chain of Lys(111). The structure also explains a requirement for the Cys(105)-Cys(137) disulfide bond in CRT/CNX for efficient carbohydrate binding. The Cys(105)-Cys(137) disulfide bond is involved in intimate contacts with the third and fourth sugar moieties of the Glc(1)Man(3) tetrasaccharide. Finally, the structure rationalizes previous mutagenesis of CRT and lays a structural groundwork for future studies of the role of CNX/CRT in diverse biological pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2059964907,"Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) surprised medical workers by a massive outbreak in the Indian Ocean region, reaching Europe in 2007, with exceptional pathologies in infants and elderly patients. Although CHIKV was recently shown to persist in myoblasts, monocytes, and macrophages, we argued that robust antiviral mechanisms, including apoptosis, are essential to ward off the virus. Herein, we tested the capacity of CHIKV to mobilize the apoptotic machinery in HeLa cells as well as primary fibroblasts, making use of several inhibitors of caspases, cell blebbing, and engulfment of the apoptotic blebs by neighboring cells. CHIKV triggered apoptosis through intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Bystander apoptosis was also evidenced in neighboring cells in a caspase-8-dependent manner. Remarkably, by hiding in apoptotic blebs, CHIKV was able to infect neighboring cells. In HeLa cells, these events were inhibited specifically by zVAD-fmk and DEVD-cho (caspase inhibitors), blebbistatin, Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor), and genistein, annexin V, and cytochalasin B (inhibitors of blebbing and engulfment). These CHIKV-apoptotic blebs were also capable of infecting macrophages (primary cultures, MM6- and THP1-PMA differentiated cells) otherwise refractory to infection by CHIKV alone. Remarkably, viral replication in macrophages did not yield a proinflammatory response. We describe a novel infectious mechanism by which CHIKV invades host cells and escapes the host response."

However, very few studies have conducted a multivariate analysis incorporating both the major predictors of depression in women, in accordance with comprehensive developmental models of depression, and specific stressors associated with the biological and psychosocial state of the mother-to-be. Methodology/Principal Findings We used a cross-sectional cohort design to analyze the associations between prenatal depression and potential risk factors. 693 French-speaking women with singleton pregnancies at 20–28 weeks' gestation were consecutively recruited at Caen University Hospital. Fifty women with missing values were subsequently excluded from the analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Risk factors were either extracted from the computerized obstetric records or assessed by means of self-administered questionnaires. The associations between prenatal depression and the potential risk factors were assessed using log-binomial regression models to obtain a direct estimate of relative risk (RR). The following factors were found to be significant in the multivariate analysis: level of education (p<0.001), past psychiatric history (adjusted RR = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1;2.8, p = 0.014), stress related to the health and viability of the fetus (adjusted RR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.6;4.1, p<0.001), and stress related to severe marital conflicts (adjusted RR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.5;3.9, p<0.001) or to serious difficulties at work (adjusted RR = 1.6, 95% CI :1.04;2.4, p = 0.031). An association was also found with the previous delivery of a child with a major or minor birth defect (adjusted RR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.04;4.0, p = 0.038). Univariate analyses revealed a strong association with childhood adversity (parental rejection: RR = 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2;2.8, p = 0.0055 and family secrets: RR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2;3.1, p = 0.0046) and with lack of partner support (RR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30;0.84, p = 0.0086). Conclusions/Significance Our study identifies several risk factors that could easily be assessed in clinical practice. It draws attention to the impact of previously delivering a child with a birth defect. The association with childhood adversity warrants further study."
https://openalex.org/W2077429257,"Background Circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology are the observable phenotypes from cycles in expression of, interactions between, and degradation of the underlying molecular components. In bilaterian animals, the core molecular components include Timeless-Timeout, photoreceptive cryptochromes, and several members of the basic-loop-helix-Per-ARNT-Sim (bHLH-PAS) family. While many of core circadian genes are conserved throughout the Bilateria, their specific roles vary among species. Here, we identify and experimentally study the rhythmic gene expression of conserved circadian clock members in a sea anemone in order to characterize this gene network in a member of the phylum Cnidaria and to infer critical components of the clockwork used in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians. Methodology/Principal Findings We identified homologs of circadian regulatory genes in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis, including a gene most similar to Timeout, three cryptochromes, and several key bHLH-PAS transcription factors. We then maintained N. vectensis either in complete darkness or in a 12 hour light: 12 hour dark cycle in three different light treatments (blue only, full spectrum, blue-depleted). Gene expression varied in response to light cycle and light treatment, with a particularly strong pattern observed for NvClock. The cryptochromes more closely related to the light-sensitive clade of cryptochromes were upregulated in light treatments that included blue wavelengths. With co-immunoprecipitation, we determined that heterodimerization between CLOCK and CYCLE is conserved within N. vectensis. Additionally, we identified E-box motifs, DNA sequences recognized by the CLOCK:CYCLE heterodimer, upstream of genes showing rhythmic expression. Conclusions/Significance This study reveals conserved molecular and functional components of the circadian clock that were in place at the divergence of the Cnidaria and Bilateria, suggesting the animal circadian clockwork is more ancient than previous data suggest. Characterizing circadian regulation in a cnidarian provides insight into the early origins of animal circadian rhythms and molecular regulation of environmentally cued behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2026791298,"The impact of retinal pathology detected by high-resolution imaging on vision remains largely unexplored. Therefore, the aim of the study was to achieve high-resolution structure-function correlation of the human macula in vivo.To obtain high-resolution tomographic and topographic images of the macula spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO), respectively, were used. Functional mapping of the macula was obtained by using fundus-controlled microperimetry. Custom software allowed for co-registration of the fundus mapped microperimetry coordinates with both SD-OCT and cSLO datasets. The method was applied in a cross-sectional observational study of retinal diseases and in a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of intravitreal ranibizumab in macular telangietasia type 2. There was a significant relationship between outer retinal thickness and retinal sensitivity (p<0.001) and neurodegeneration leaving less than about 50 µm of parafoveal outer retinal thickness completely abolished light sensitivity. In contrast, functional preservation was found if neurodegeneration spared the photoreceptors, but caused quite extensive disruption of the inner retina. Longitudinal data revealed that small lesions affecting the photoreceptor layer typically precede functional detection but later cause severe loss of light sensitivity. Ranibizumab was shown to be ineffective to prevent such functional loss in macular telangietasia type 2.Since there is a general need for efficient monitoring of the effectiveness of therapy in neurodegenerative diseases of the retina and since SD-OCT imaging is becoming more widely available, surrogate endpoints derived from such structure-function correlation may become highly relevant in future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2113695378,"Nucleoside diphosphate kinases (NDPKs) are encoded by the Nme (non-metastatic cell) gene family. Although they comprise a family of 10 genes, NDPK-A and -B are ubiquitously expressed and account for most of the NDPK activity. We previously showed that NDPK-B activates the K(+) channel KCa3.1 via histidine phosphorylation of the C terminus of KCa3.1, which is required for T cell receptor-stimulated Ca(2+) flux and proliferation of activated naive human CD4 T cells. We now report the phenotype of NDPK-B(-/-) mice. NDPK-B(-/-) mice are phenotypically normal at birth with a normal life span. Although T and B cell development is normal in NDPK-B(-/-) mice, KCa3.1 channel activity and cytokine production are markedly defective in T helper 1 (Th1) and Th2 cells, whereas Th17 function is normal. These findings phenocopy studies in the same cells isolated from KCa3.1(-/-) mice and thereby support genetically that NDPK-B functions upstream of KCa3.1. NDPK-A and -B have been linked to an astonishing array of disparate cellular and biochemical functions, few of which have been confirmed in vivo in physiological relevant systems. NDPK-B(-/-) mice will be an essential tool with which to definitively address the biological functions of NDPK-B. Our finding that NDPK-B is required for activation of Th1 and Th2 CD4 T cells, together with the normal overall phenotype of NDPK-B(-/-) mice, suggests that specific pharmacological inhibitors of NDPK-B may provide new opportunities to treat Th1- and Th2-mediated autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2042168553,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomes and proteins are present in human brain tissues although the impact of HIV/HCV co-infection on neuropathogenesis remains unclear. Herein, we investigate HCV infectivity and effects on neuronal survival and neuroinflammation in conjunction with HIV infection. Methodology Human microglia, astrocyte and neuron cultures were infected with cell culture-derived HCV or exposed to HCV core protein with or without HIV-1 infection or HIV-1 Viral Protein R (Vpr) exposure. Host immune gene expression and cell viability were measured. Patch-clamp studies of human neurons were performed in the presence or absence of HCV core protein. Neurobehavioral performance and neuropathology were examined in HIV-1 Vpr-transgenic mice in which stereotaxic intrastriatal implants of HCV core protein were performed. Principal Findings HCV-encoded RNA as well as HCV core and non-structural 3 (NS3) proteins were detectable in human microglia and astrocytes infected with HCV. HCV core protein exposure induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1β, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α in microglia (p<0.05) but not in astrocytes while increased chemokine (e.g. CXCL10 and interleukin-8) expression was observed in both microglia and astrocytes (p<0.05). HCV core protein modulated neuronal membrane currents and reduced both β-III-tubulin and lipidated LC3-II expression (p<0.05). Neurons exposed to supernatants from HCV core-activated microglia exhibited reduced β-III-tubulin expression (p<0.05). HCV core protein neurotoxicity and interleukin-6 induction were potentiated by HIV-1 Vpr protein (p<0.05). HIV-1 Vpr transgenic mice implanted with HCV core protein showed gliosis, reduced neuronal counts together with diminished LC3 immunoreactivity. HCV core-implanted animals displayed neurobehavioral deficits at days 7 and 14 post-implantation (p<0.05). Conclusions HCV core protein exposure caused neuronal injury through suppression of neuronal autophagy in addition to neuroimmune activation. The additive neurotoxic effects of HCV- and HIV-encoded proteins highlight extrahepatic mechanisms by which HCV infection worsens the disease course of HIV infection."

Direct measurement of the magnitude and characteristics of water stored within glaciers has proved difficult, but Joel Harper et al. now report the discovery of an extensive network of interconnected basal crevasses within the Bench Glacier in Alaska, revealed through the use of a combination of direct borehole observations and radar and seismic imaging. The crevasses hold water equivalent to a 10-centimetre layer, enough to be an important factor for future ice-sheet modelling. Water within glaciers and ice sheets has a strong potential to influence ice velocity and, ultimately, the rate of sea-level rise. But so far direct measurement of the magnitude and characteristics of water stored within glaciers has proved difficult. Here, a combination of in situ borehole measurements and radar and seismic imaging has been used to show that there is an extensive network of basal crevasses in the Bench Glacier in Alaska. The crevasses hold water equivalent to at least a decimetre layer. Water plays a first-order role in basal sliding of glaciers and ice sheets and is often a key constituent of accelerated glacier motion1,2,3,4. Subglacial water is known to occupy systems of cavities and conduits at the interface between ice and the underlying bed surface, depending upon the history of water input and the characteristics of the substrate5. Full understanding of the extent and configuration of basal water is lacking, however, because direct observation is difficult. This limits our ability to simulate ice dynamics and the subsequent impacts on sea-level rise realistically. Here we show that the subglacial hydrological system can have a large volume of water occupying basal crevasses that extend upward from the bed into the overlying ice. Radar and seismic imaging combined with in situ borehole measurements collected on Bench Glacier, Alaska, reveal numerous water-filled basal crevasses with highly transmissive connections to the bed. Some crevasses extend many tens of metres above the bed and together they hold a volume of water equivalent to at least a decimetre layer covering the bed. Our results demonstrate that the basal hydrologic system can extend high into the overlying ice mass, where basal crevasses increase water-storage capacity and could potentially modulate basal water pressure. Because basal crevasses can form under commonly observed glaciological conditions, our findings have implications for interpreting and modelling subglacial hydrologic processes and related sliding accelerations of glaciers and ice sheets."

Checkpoint with forkhead-associated and RING domains (CHFR) is central to this checkpoint, and its activity is ablated in many tumors and cancer cell lines through promoter hypermethylation or mutation. The interaction between the PAR-binding zinc finger (PBZ) of CHFR and poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is crucial for a functional antephase checkpoint. We determined the crystal structure of the cysteine-rich region of human CHFR (amino acids 425–664) to 1.9 Å resolution, which revealed a multizinc binding domain of elaborate topology within which the PBZ is embedded. The PBZ of CHFR closely resembles the analogous motifs from aprataxin-like factor and CG1218-PA, which lie within unstructured regions of their respective proteins. Based on co-crystal structures of CHFR bound to several different PAR-like ligands (adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose, adenosine monophosphate, and P1P2-diadenosine 5′-pyrophosphate), we made a model of the CHFR-PAR interaction, which we validated using site-specific mutagenesis and surface plasmon resonance.

Progress through the eukaryotic cell division cycle is regulated by mechanisms, or checkpoints, that detect potentially disastrous defects, such as DNA damage (1Morgan D.O. The Cell Cycle, Principles of Control. Oxford University Press, 2007Google Scholar). Cells are particularly sensitive to defects during mitosis, and several checkpoints regulate the passage into mitosis/M phase from interphase/G2 and progress through mitosis to ensure the accurate segregation of chromosomes. The early prophase or antephase checkpoint responds to cellular stresses, such as microtubule poisons and UV irradiation, encountered in the period before late prophase and leads to decondensation of chromosomes and a delay in mitotic progression (reviewed in Ref. 2Chin C.F.

Dantzer F. Ame J.C. de Murcia G. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). There are at least 17 PAR polymerases (PARPs) in the human genome and also a number of enzymes that modify proteins singly with mono(ADP-ribose) (mADPr). PARPs catalyze the displacement of the nicotinamide group of NAD+ by the growing PAR chain to form a 1–2-O-glycosidic linkage with the 2′-OH group of either the adenine ribose or the nicotinamide ribose, resulting in a branched and heterogeneous polymer. Several PARPs have mitotic functions; e.g. tankyrase-1 modifies the spindle-associated protein NuMA, and this activity is required for the proper assembly and maintenance of bipolar spindles (16Chang P. Coughlin M. Mitchison T.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 17Chang W. Dynek J.N. Smith S. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PAR synthesis is essential for a functional antephase checkpoint, and CHFR interacts with PAR through a 20-amino acid PAR binding zinc finger motif (PBZ) at the C-terminal end of its cysteine-rich region (see Fig. 1A) (18Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). CHFR lacking the PBZ does not co-localize with nuclear PAR foci in interphase HEK293T cells and cannot rescue antephase checkpoint function in HeLa cells despite retaining autoubiquitination activity (18Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). The loss of checkpoint function might, however, be due to some other defect of CHFR lacking the PBZ that was not controlled for, such as binding and ubiquitination of substrates (e.g. Aurora-A and HDAC1), which requires the cysteine-rich region (9Yu X. Minter-Dykhouse K. Malureanu L. Zhao W.M. Zhang D. Merkle C.J. Ward I.M. Saya H. Fang G. van Deursen J. Chen J. Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 401-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Oh Y.M.

Nevertheless, it seems likely that the CHFR-PAR interaction is an important part of the antephase checkpoint and could form part of the checkpoint sensor for cellular stress and microtubule poisons or be required for proper localization of CHFR. poly(ADP-ribose) PAR-binding zinc finger poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose P1P2-diadenosine 5′-pyrophosphate surface plasmon resonance resonance units. The structure of the CHFR PBZ and the basis of molecular recognition of PAR are unknown. NMR structures of PBZs from the DNA damage factor APLF (aprataxin and PNK-like factor) and an uncharacterized Drosophila protein CG1218-PA have been determined (19Isogai S. Kanno S. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Ito Y. Yasui A. Shirakawa M. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 20Eustermann S. Brockmann C. Mehrotra P.V. Yang J.C. Loakes D. West S.C. Ahel I.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9129-9134Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of PAR has frustrated attempts to derive high resolution structures of the PAR-PBZ interaction. Nevertheless, studies with APLF and ligands that resemble small PAR fragments have identified a single adenine binding site within a hydrophobic pocket that is crucial for PAR binding (20Eustermann S. Brockmann C. Mehrotra P.V. Yang J.C. Loakes D. West S.C. Ahel I. Neuhaus D. Nat. Struct Mol. Biol. 2010; 17: 241-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Li G.Y. McCulloch R.D. Fenton A.L.

NMR chemical shift experiments using PAR and mADPr suggest that this pocket has a conserved function in CG1218-PA and CHFR (19Isogai S. Kanno S. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Ito Y. Yasui A. Shirakawa M. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The binding site for PAR extends over more of the PBZ surface than just this pocket, although it is not known which other PAR features are recognized. The binding site of PAR on CHFR appears to be more extensive than on other PBZs and is greater than that of mADPr, although this might be an artifact of the isolated PBZ motif removed from the context of the cysteine-rich region (19Isogai S. Kanno S. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Ito Y. Yasui A. Shirakawa M. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Many of the key details of PAR recognition by PBZs remain to be discovered. For example, it is not clear whether individual PBZs recognize more than one subunit of PAR, which is presumably important for discrimination between PAR and mADPr. The forkhead-associated domain is the only region of CHFR for which a structure has been determined (22Stavridi E.S. Huyen Y. Loreto I.R. Scolnick D.M. Halazonetis T.D. Pavletich N.P. Jeffrey P.D. Structure. 2002; 10: 891-899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because there are no structures of the other domains of CHFR or details of its interactions with molecular partners, we investigated the purification and crystallization of the human CHFR protein. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of human CHFR and the details of its interaction with PAR. CHFR cysteine-rich domain constructs 407–664 (CHFR-C1) and 394–664 (CHFR-C2) were cloned into the pETM6T1 vector (derived from pET44 (Novagen)) with an N-terminal, tobacco etch virus-cleavable His6-NusA tag for expression in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown in lysogeny broth medium at 37 °C to an optical density of 0.4, induced by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated overnight at 21 °C. 0.4 mm ZnCl2 was added to the medium before induction. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Proteins were purified by anion exchange using an anion exchange-Sepharose 4 fast flow column (GE Healthcare) run with an increasing salt gradient from 0.1 to 1 m NaCl over 20 column volumes. The tag was cleaved overnight with tobacco etch virus protease at a ratio of ∼1:20 to eluted protein. The proteins were reloaded onto the anion exchange-Sepharose column to separate the cleaved proteins from the tag and then further purified using a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), which was equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.5, and 2% (v/v) glycerol. Proteins were concentrated in gel filtration buffer to 8 mg/ml. Full-length CHFR, prepared for thermal denaturation and PAR-binding assays, was cloned into a modified version of the pRSF vector (Novagen) with an N-terminal cleavable His6-FLAG-double streptavidin tag. The full-length protein was expressed using the same method as for the CHFR cysteine-rich domain constructs. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet. The protein was purified using Strep-Tactin resin (Fisher) and eluted by cleaving the tag with 3C protease in lysis buffer (without protease inhibitors). The protein was further purified using a Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column as described for the CHFR cysteine-rich domain constructs. Mutations were introduced into full-length CHFR by the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene), and mutant proteins were expressed and purified in the same way as the wild type full-length protein. The initial crystallization hit for the CHFR 407–664 construct was obtained from the Qiagen Classics Suite HT screen, which was set up using an Art Robbins Phoenix liquid handling system. Crystals of dimension less than 50 μm initially appeared after 3 weeks in 12% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, buffer. An additive screen was carried out using additive screen HT (Hampton research) to optimize this condition further. Larger crystals (100 μm) were observed within 7 days when 0.1 m KCl was added to the original crystallization buffer. All subsequent CHFR-C1 and CHFR-C2 crystals were grown by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 18 °C by mixing 1 μl of protein with an equal volume of well buffer containing 12% (w/v) PEG 20,000, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.1 m MES, pH 6.5, buffer. For the co-crystallization of CHFR 407–664 with adenosine 5′-diphosphoribose (mADPR) and AMP, the protein was incubated on ice with 5 mm mADPR (Sigma) and 10 mm AMP (Sigma), respectively, for 1 h, before adding 1 μl of this mixture to 1 μl of well buffer. All crystals were soaked for 5 min in well buffer (plus 5 or 10 mm of the ligand), supplemented with 20% (w/v) PEG 20,000, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Nucleotide-free CHFR 394–664 crystals were used for the ligand-soaking experiments. The synthesis of P1P2-diadenosine 5′-pyrophosphate (AMP2) was carried out essentially as previously described (23Millo E. Zocchi E. Galatini A. Benatti U. Damonte G. Synth. Commun. 2008; 38: 3260-3269Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (see supplemental material for further details). Crystals were transferred to a fresh drop-containing well buffer supplemented with 10 mm AMP2 for 8 h and then transferred to a fresh drop-containing well buffer (plus 10 mm AMP2) supplemented with 20% (w/v) PEG 20,000 and flash frozen. Data were collected at the Diamond light source, UK (beamlines I02, I03, and I04). Fluorescence scans of these crystals showed the presence of bound zinc, which was resolved into 10 sites. One crystal of the CHFR 407–664 mADPR complex was used to collect data sets at two wavelengths, one close to the zinc edge and a high resolution data set far from the edge (Table 1). Data were processed using Mosflm and Scala (24Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4.Acta Crystallogr. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). Single-wavelength anomalous dispersion experimental phases were calculated using data set 1 (figure of merit was 0.35, which was improved to 0.69 after density modification), and the initial model was built using the Autosol and Autobuild programs, part of the PHENIX software suite (25Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. McCoy A.J. Moriarty N.W. Oeffner R. Read R.J. Richardson D.C. Richardson J.S. Terwilliger T.C. Zwart P.H. Acta Crystallogr. D. 2010; 66: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (16563) Google Scholar). The structure obtained in the presence of mADPR was used as a model to solve the structure of the nucleotide-free, AMP- and AMP2-bound protein by molecular replacement in PHASER (26McCoy A.J.

Open table in a new tab Thermal denaturation assays using Sypro Orange dye (Sigma) were used to measure the relative thermal stability of CHFR proteins. Sypro Orange fluoresces when bound to hydrophobic regions exposed in proteins. As the proteins are heated, they unfold, and there is an increase in fluorescence. 100-μl samples of 5 μm CHFR were prepared on ice in 50 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris 8.5, 2% (v/v) glycerol, and 5× Sypro Orange. 25-μl aliquots of each protein sample were then added to three wells of a 96-well PCR plate (Bio-Rad), and each protein was analyzed in triplicate. The thermal denaturation assay was conducted in an iCycler, iQ5 Real Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad). Samples were prechilled in the machine to 4 °C for 10 min, and then the plate was heated up from 4 to 95 °C at 2 °C/min. Fluorescence intensity of the Sypro Orange was measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 470/600 nm. The fluorescence data were fitted to the equation, y = (anx + bn) + ((adx + bd) − (anx + bn))/(1 + e(Tm − x)/m), using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.), where an and ad represent the slopes of the native and denatured base lines, bn and bd are the y intercepts of the native and denatured baselines, Tm is the apparent melting temperature, and m describes the slope of the denaturation. SPR assays were performed on a BIAcore 3000 instrument (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C using running buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5 mm TCEP, 0.005% (v/v) Tween 20). 35 RU of biotinyl-PAR (see supplemental material) was immobilized on flow cells 2 and 4 of BIAcore SA sensor chips (GE Healthcare), 1 and 3 being left blank. All flow cells were then blocked with 5 mm biotin. CHFR proteins were dialyzed against running buffer and injected at 40 μl/min for 375 s over pairs of blank and PAR-containing flow cells. Individual sensorgrams were recorded for each CHFR protein at each of >10 concentrations over a range from 0.1 nm to 2 μm (supplemental Fig. S7). The sensor chip surface was regenerated between injections by perfusion of 35 μl of 20 mm glycine/HCl, pH 2.0, at 10 μl/min. Sensorgrams were processed using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB). Sensorgrams recorded from flow cells 2 and 4 were corrected for passive refractive index changes and nonspecific interactions by subtraction of the corresponding sensorgram recorded from flow cells 1 and 3. With 35 RU of immobilized biotinyl-PAR, maximum binding of CHFR was ∼110 RU. The association phase of sensorgrams (t = 0–360 s) were fitted to a biphasic exponential equation, r = Req1(1 − e−Ka1t) + Req2(1 − e−Ka2t), using Prism 5, to derive values for response at equilibrium (Req), where Req = Req1 + Req2. Req was plotted against sample concentration and fitted by non-linear regression to a binding isotherm described by the equation Req = ([CHFR]n × 110 RU)/([CHFR]n + KDn). The PAR model Protein Data Bank file and refinement parameters (.cif) were initially produced using the PRODRG server and edited to correct the obvious stereochemical errors. One adenine group and one AMP group were automatically fitted into the electron density maps (of the AMP and AMP2 ligand structures, respectively) using COOT, which was also used for several rounds of manual fitting (to remove any clashes) and geometry refinement. The final structure was energy-minimized as described in the supplemental material. CHFR consists of an N-terminal FHA domain, a central RING domain, and C-terminal cysteine-rich region (CHFR-C, residues 407–664) (Fig. 1A). It is not known whether these domains are independent or whether they interact. Searches of the SWISSPROT, SMART, and Pfam databases suggested that this putative zinc binding region is unrelated to any domains of known three-dimensional structure (29Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar, 30Sonnhammer E.L. Eddy S.R. Durbin R. Proteins. 1997; 28: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar) with the exception of the PBZ motif (residues 620–644) (18Ahel I. Ahel D. Matsusaka T. Clark A.J. Pines J. Boulton S.J. West S.C. Nature. 2008; 451: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 19Isogai S. Kanno S. Ariyoshi M. Tochio H. Ito Y. Yasui A. Shirakawa M. Genes Cells. 2010; 15: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to determine the structure of the cysteine-rich region using x-ray crystallography. Two different fragments of CHFR that included the entire cysteine-rich region were crystallized in space group C2: residues 407–664 in the presence of mono-ADP-ribose (CHFR-C1/mADPR) and residues 394–664 in apo-form (CHFR-C2). The structure of CHFR-C1/mADPR was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing, which revealed two protein chains having five zinc sites each, and was refined to a final resolution of 1.9 Å (Table 1 and Fig. 1B). The apo-form was solved by molecular replacement and refined to 2.5 Å. The structures were highly similar both within (Cα root mean square deviation = 1.13 Å) and between (Cα root mean square deviation = 0.22 Å) crystals except for the last three residues, which diverge by 3–11 Å, indicating some flexibility in this region. In both structures, residues 425–445 and 473–663 are modeled, whereas no ordered electron density was observed for residues 446–472. The cysteine-rich region forms a single continuous structural unit comprising an N-terminal region that has only a few short secondary structure elements, a central α-helical region, and a C-terminal PBZ motif (Fig. 2). The secondary structure of CHFR-C comprises eight α-helices and four β-strands. The strands are each made up of three residues and formed into two short β-sheets. No structures that significantly resemble the whole CHFR-C domain were found from a search of the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (31Holm L. Kääriäinen S. Rosenström P. Schenkel A. Bioinformatics. 2008; 24: 2780-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows how the protein chain traces a meandering path between the first four zinc binding sites (colored blue to green) past the α-helical region (colored green, yellow, and orange) and down to contact the PBZ (colored red). The chain returns back through two α-helices (colored green and yellow) and connects to the N-terminal region via the second half of zinc motif 4. A long helix (colored orange in Fig. 1B) then leads the chain finally into the PBZ (colored red). The long loops between β3-α4 and α5-β4 are ordered through a network of hydrogen bonds and through packing of conserved hydrophobic side chains against the hydrophobic residues of α4, α5, and α6, as shown for Phe536 in supplemental Fig. S1. There are four zinc-binding motifs within CHFR-C, which bind five zinc ions (Fig. 2 and supplemental Movie S1). It is usually the case that tandem zinc binding domains are modular, with distinct motifs within the sequence in which the four residues that coordinate each zinc ion are clustered (see the Protein of the Month: Zinc Fingers I"

Severe redox imbalance by overproduction of reactive oxygen species is one of the main causes of necrosis. Here we demonstrate that H2O2 induces a sustained activity of TRPM4, a Ca2+-activated, Ca2+-impermeant nonselective cation channel resulting in an increased vulnerability to cell death. In HEK 293 cells overexpressing TRPM4, H2O2 was found to eliminate in a dose-dependent manner TRPM4 desensitization. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that the Cys1093 residue is crucial for the H2O2-mediated loss of desensitization. In HeLa cells, which endogenously express TRPM4, H2O2 elicited necrosis as well as apoptosis. H2O2-mediated necrosis but not apoptosis was abolished by replacement of external Na+ ions with sucrose or the non-permeant cation N-methyl-d-glucamine and by knocking down TRPM4 with a shRNA directed against TRPM4. Conversely, transient overexpression of TRPM4 in HeLa cells in which TRPM4 was previously silenced re-established vulnerability to H2O2-induced necrotic cell death. In addition, HeLa cells exposed to H2O2 displayed an irreversible loss of membrane potential, which was prevented by TRPM4 knockdown.

In addition, these channels have been shown to depend on phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (7Zhang Z. Okawa H. Wang Y. Liman E.R. J. Biol.

TRPM4 features similar biophysical and pharmacological properties to Ca2+-activated, Ca2+-impermeable nonselective cation channels (CAN) described in many excitable and nonexcitable cells (9Chen M. Simard J.M. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6512-6521Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Petersen O.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R520-R522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). CAN channels are widely expressed among different tissues exhibiting several common characteristics, such as a low open probability when studied in situ, a conductance of 15–30 pS under symmetrical Na+ conditions, and a weak voltage-dependent gating. In addition, these channels are activated by intracellular Ca2+ and blocked by ATP, suggesting that their activation may be coupled to the metabolic status of the cell. Furthermore, some CAN channels have been found to be activated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a number of cell types (11Inoue M. Fujishiro N. Imanaga I. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 385-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Schlenker T. Feranchak A.P. Schwake L. Stremmel W. Roman R.M. Fitz J.G.

Cell Physiol. 2004; 287: C963-C970Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Because of their ion selectivity, an unregulated activation of CAN channels may have detrimental consequences for cell homeostasis, expressed by a collapse of the Na+ and K+ transmembrane gradients, a reduction of the membrane potential, and an increased turnover rate of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump and thus, increased ATP consumption. Several of these conditions observed under oxidative stress may lead to necrotic cell death. Thus, distinctive and necessary events are membrane depolarization and cell swelling, a phenomenon known as necrotic volume increase (18Barros L.F. Hermosilla T. Castro J. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A Mol. Integr. Physiol. 2001; 130: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 19Okada Y. Maeno E. Shimizu T. Dezaki K. Wang J. Morishima S. J. Physiol. 2001; 532: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of these channels prevents cytosolic Na+ and Ca2+ overload, cell volume increase, and death of liver and neuronal cells exposed to oxidative damage (15Barros L.F. Stutzin A. Calixto A. Catalán M. Castro J. Hetz C. Hermosilla T. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 114-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 20Liang D. Bhatta S. Gerzanich V. Simard J.M. Neurosurg. Focus. 2007; 22: E2Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). More recently, Gerzanich et al. (21Gerzanich V. Woo S.K. Vennekens R. Tsymbalyuk O. Ivanova S. Ivanov A. Geng Z. Chen Z. Nilius B. Flockerzi V. Freichel M. Simard J.M. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) demonstrated that in vitro expression of TRPM4, a molecular candidate for CAN channels as previously suggested (10Petersen O.H. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R520-R522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22Simard J.M. Chen M. Tarasov K.V. Bhatta S. Ivanova S. Melnitchenko L. Tsymbalyuk N. West G.A. Gerzanich V. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), predisposes to cell death upon ATP depletion. In this work we addressed the question whether TRPM4 is modulated by ROS. Here we show that the Cys1093 residue participates in mediating the effect of H2O2 on TRPM4 current desensitization. As a result, the transmembrane potential collapses eventually leading to severe metabolic derangement and subsequent cell death. T-REx-293 cells, a HEK 293-derived cell line, were obtained from Invitrogen and cultured in DMEM/F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mm glutamine. HeLa cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in DMEM, low glucose supplemented with 5% FBS and 2 mm glutamine. Both cell lines were maintained in a 95% air, 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C, passaged twice a week and used from passages 5–10. The full-length human TRPM4b cDNA containing a FLAG epitope tag in the N terminus was cloned into a modified version of the pcDNA4/TO vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into T-REx-293 cells that stably express plasmid pcDNA6/TR for Tet-repressor expression (Invitrogen). Cells were placed under zeocin selection and zeocin-resistant clones were screened for tetracycline-inducible expression of the FLAG-tagged TRPM4 protein. The medium was supplemented with blasticidin (5 µg/ml, Invitrogen) and zeocin (0.4 mg/ml, Invitrogen). For most experiments, cells were resuspended in medium containing 1 µg/ml of tetracycline (Invitrogen) 18–24 h before experiments. For electrophysiological experiments cells were plated on coverslips and 1 µg/ml of tetracycline was added for 16–24 h before performing experiments. A short-hairpin RNA for TRPM4 was constructed according to Ref. 23Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar. Briefly, 64-mer primers were designed to include a 19-mer TRPM4 sequence (24Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), its complement, a spacer region, 5′ BglII site and 3′ HindIII sites. A scrambled duplex was used as a control. The annealed double-stranded DNA was cloned into the pSUPER.retro.neo vector (Oligoengine, Seattle, WA) and HeLa cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and placed under G418 (Sigma) selection. G418-resistant clones were screened for TRPM4 mRNA reduction and clones were kept in a medium supplemented with G418 (0.5 mg/ml; Invitrogen). RT and qPCR were performed to measure TRPM2, TRPM4, TRPM7, and the housekeeping gene GADPH mRNA levels in HeLa cells using the primers described in Ref. 25Fonfria E. Murdock P.R. Cusdin F.S. Benham C.D. Kelsell R.E. McNulty S. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 2006; 26: 159-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). DNase I-treated RNA was used for reverse transcription using the SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen). Equal amounts of RNA were used as templates in each reaction. qPCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Data are presented as relative mRNA levels of the gene of interest normalized to relative levels of GADPH mRNA. These values were calculated from a standard curve generated with HeLa wild type cDNA. Mutagenesis (C1093A) of the recombinant human TRPM4 cDNA in the pcDNA4/TO vector was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's instructions, using the primers: forward, 5′-TGCTCAGGCAATTGGCTAGGCGACC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GGTCGCCTAGCCAATTGCCTGAGCA-3′. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant was verified by DNA sequencing. Whole cell patch clamp experiments on T-REx-293 hTRPM4 cells were performed 16–24 h after tetracycline induction. In acute overexpression experiments, HEK 293 cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the C1093A mutation using Lipofectamine 2000 and electrophysiological experiments were conducted 48 h post transfection. For whole cell experiments, the internal pipette solution contained (in mm) CsCl 140, NaCl 5, MgCl2 1, BAPTA 1, CaCl2 0.83, and pH 7.2 adjusted with CsOH. The bath solution (in mm) was: NaCl 140, CsCl 5, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10, tamoxifen 0.01, and pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH. For current clamp experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm): KCl 140, NaCl 5, HEPES 10, CaCl2 0.01, MgCl2 1, pH 7.2, adjusted with KOH and the bath solution contained (in mm), NaCl 140, KCl 5, CaCl2 1, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES, 10, tamoxifen, 0.01, and pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. In inside-out experiments, the pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH. The bath solution contained (in mm): 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.01 CaCl2, 10 HEPES, 1 HEDTA, pH 7.2, adjusted with NaOH. Free [Ca2+] of the solutions was calculated using the program WinMaxc, version 2.50 with the appropriate Ca2+ buffers. Patch clamp experiments were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). Data were digitized at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. The pClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices Corp.) was used for data acquisition and analysis. Patch electrodes (∼3 MΩ resistance) were pulled from borosilicate glass (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) using a BB-CH puller (Mecanex SA, Geneva, Switzerland). When applicable, voltages were corrected for liquid junction potentials. All experiments were conducted at 22 ± 2 °C. T-REx-293 hTRPM4 cells were exposed to experimental conditions in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin instead of FBS. Cells were exposed to H2O2 (Merck KgaA-Chemicals, Darmstad, Germany) for 4 h and viability was determined 20 h later. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity in cell supernatants was determined by a colorimetric end point kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). A calibration curve was produced to ensure linearity in the range studied. Background was subtracted and data were expressed as the fraction of maximum release measured in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). T-REx-293 hTRPM4 or HeLa cells were exposed to experimental conditions in DMEM/F-12 or DMEM-low glucose, respectively, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin instead of FBS. Cells were exposed to H2O2 for 4 h and viability was determined 20 h later. In selected experiments, DMEM was made following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) and reagents to facilitate Na+ replacement. HEPES (25 mm) was used as a buffer instead of NaHCO3 and cells were kept at 37 °C without CO2. Sodium was replaced equimolarly by N-methyl-d-glucamine or sucrose. Osmolarity was kept constant across different solutions. Osmolarity was measured with a micro-osmometer (Advanced Instruments, Norwood, MA). Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 800 × g for 5 min and the pellet was suspended in 200 µl of PBS. Afterward, cells were washed once with PBS and stained with propidium iodide (PI, 10 µg/ml, Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. DNA content was analyzed with a flow cytometry system (FACSCanto, BD Biosciences). A minimum of 10,000 cells/sample were analyzed. PI intensity analysis was performed using FACSDiva software version 4.1.1 (BD Biosciences). Cell death was determined according to a previously described method (26Hetz C. Bono M.R. Barros L.F. Lagos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In brief, PI enters the cell upon plasma membrane disruption thus binding to DNA. Because its fluorescence is proportional to the DNA content, live cells (M0) present a low fluorescence, whereas in necrotic cells (M2) PI binds mainly to intact DNA showing a high fluorescence. Apoptotic cells with degraded DNA (M1) bind less PI than necrotic cells but its fluorescence is higher than M0. shRNA-TRPM4 and shRNA-SS HeLa cells cultured on 25-mm glass coverslips were put into a recording chamber mounted on a confocal spinning disk system (DSU Olympus, Germany) and changes in cell water volume of individual cells were assessed by measuring variations in the concentration of the intracellularly trapped fluorescent dye red calcein (Invitrogen), with an excitation wavelength of 555 nm and emission wavelength between 580 and 620 nm recorded with a band pass filter, similar as previously described (27Crowe W.E. Altamirano J. Huerto L. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 28Stutzin A. Torres R. Oporto M. Pacheco P. Eguiguren A.L. Cid L.P. Sepúlveda F.V. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 1999; 277: C392-C402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were loaded with 5 µm calcein-AM for 5 min and then superfused with an isosmotic solution for 15 min before adding H2O2. Images were obtained at 10-s intervals and the fluorescence of a ∼10-µm2 area in the center of a cell was measured. Data are presented as Vt/V0 values, where V0 is the cell water volume in isosmotic solution at time 0 and Vt is the cell water volume at time t. Vt/V0 was calculated from the fluorescence intensity ratio F0/Ft. Cells were harvested and collected by centrifugation (3,000 × g at 4 °C) and lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm PMSF, 1.5 µg/ml of aprotinin, 10 µg/ml of antipain, 10 µg/ml of leupeptin, 0.1 mg/ml of benzamidine, pH 7.4). Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and proteins from the supernatants were size-fractionated in 6 and 12% SDS-PAGE (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin polyclonal antibodies (Sigma), respectively. Unless stated, all chemicals and reagents were from Merck KgaA-Chemicals (Darmstad, Germany) and Sigma. All results are presented as mean ± S.E. from 3 or more independent experiments. Statistical analysis of the data were performed using Statgraphics Plus 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni or Dunns post hoc tests and Student's t test were used and considered significant at p < 0.05. To address the role of TRPM4 in ROS-mediated cell death, we first explored whether TRPM4 would be sensitive to ROS. Fig. 1A shows an averaged time course of currents measured at 100 mV activated by 600 nm Ca2+ in the pipette solution in T-REx-293 hTRPM4 cells overexpressing TRPM4 under the control of a tet inducible system (HEK-TRPM4 tet+) (24Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1A). As expected for heterologously overexpressed TRPM4 channels, the current was transient and appeared to be completely abolished after 2 min and showed no reactivation even at 20 min (supplemental Fig. S1B) (7Zhang Z. Okawa H. Wang Y. Liman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39185-39192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 30Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To discard that the recorded current was carried by Cl− ions, experiments were performed in which the extracellular NaCl concentration was reduced to 40 mm. As predictable for a cation current, the reversal potential shifted to −31 mV, close to the expected value of −29 mV (n = 8). There was no influence of H2O2 on the reversal potential of the currents. Fig. 1B depicts representative control whole cell current traces at −100 and 100 mV recorded at 30 (peak) and 120 s after breaking into the cell. The I-V curves obtained from representative voltage ramps, measured at the peak and 120 s, display the typical rectification found for TRPM4 currents (Fig. 1C) (4Nilius B. Prenen J. Droogmans G. Voets T. Vennekens R. Freichel M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30813-30820Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). To study the effect of H2O2 on TRPM4 currents, HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells were exposed to 200 µm H2O2 throughout the recording. In the experiments with H2O2, tamoxifen was used to avoid contamination with volume-activated Cl− currents (31Varela D. Simon F. Riveros A. Jørgensen F. Stutzin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13301-13304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). As depicted in Fig. 1D, the current (measured at 100 mV) remained activated and showed very little desensitization. The loss of desensitization was also evident when observing traces recorded at −100 and 100 mV (Fig. 1E). The I-V relationship was comparable with control conditions at the peak and at later times during the experiment, yet showed less inward rectification (Fig. 1F). The effect of H2O2 was dose-dependent and became apparent at concentrations ≥50 µm without significant modification of the voltage dependence (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). The effect of H2O2 on TRPM4 currents was also observed in whole cell (supplemental Fig. S1E) and inside-out recordings (supplemental Fig. S1F) upon exposure to H2O2 after current desensitization. Flufenamic acid (100 µm) or glibenclamide (10 µm), two known inhibitors of TRPM4 (32Guinamard R. Demion M. Magaud C. Potreau D. Bois P. Hypertension. 2006; 48: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) significantly reduced this non-desensitizing current from 148 ± 15.8 to 5 ± 2.1 and 9.6 ± 5.6 pA/pF, respectively (not shown). Because of the striking similarity between the effect of H2O2 and an increased calmodulin binding at the C terminus region on whole cell current desensitization (30Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we focused our interest in the cysteine residue located at position 1093 in the C terminus next to the beginning of the third CaM binding motif spanning the Arg1095-Thr1151 sequence (30Nilius B. Prenen J. Tang J. Wang C. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Voets T. Zhu M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6423-6433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). It should be noted that no cysteine residues were found close to the other predicted CaM binding motif located at the C terminus of the protein. To that end, this cysteine residue was mutated to alanine and the effect of H2O2 on HEK 293 cells overexpressing the mutation was explored electrophysiologically. Fig. 2A shows a representative time course experiment of whole cell currents measured at 100 mV activated by 600 nm Ca2+ in the pipette solution. In contrast to wild type TRPM4 currents (Fig. 1D), exposure to 200 µm H2O2 had no effect on current desensitization, suggesting that for H2O2 to be effective requires the Cys1093 residue. Because of the complexity of the processes and the variety of factors that apparently govern the desensitization of TRPM4 currents, we next asked the question whether the rescue from desensitization by PI(4,5)P2 of this mutant was hindered. Fig. 2 depicts representative time course experiments of inside-out patches from HEK 293 cells overexpressing wild type TRPM4 channels (B) or channels carrying the C1093A mutation (C). The current was activated in the presence of 10 µm Ca2+ in the bath solution and recorded at 100 mV. As shown, the C1093A mutant retains the sensitivity to PI(4,5)P2, indicating that H2O2 does not hamper the action of PI(4,5)P2. To study whether a persistent, non-desensitizing TRPM4-mediated current would have an impact on cell viability, we measured LDH release of HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells subjected to H2O2. To that purpose, cells were incubated with 200 µm H2O2 for 4 h and LDH release was assessed 20 h after H2O2 removal. As seen in Fig. 3A, H2O2 did not alter significantly the proportion of live cells in HEK-TRPM4 tet− cells. In contrast, HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells exhibited a significant increase in cell death that was reduced by preincubation with NEM or DTT. As shown in Fig. 3B, the effect of NEM on cell death was correlated with the inhibition by NEM of the effect of H2O2 on TRPM4 currents. The thiol-alkylating agent NEM was used to prevent H2O2-mediated oxidation of cysteine residues. On the other hand, DTT was used to block H2O2-induced thiol modifications, maintaining these groups in a reduced state. To characterize further the H2O2-mediated cell death, flow cytometer experiments were performed. Fig. 3C displays representative histograms of PI incorporation for untreated HEK-TRPM4 tet− and HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells and cells were exposed to 200 µm H2O2 using the same protocol as described for the LDH release experiments. As shown, H2O2 induced an increase in the M2 population (∼5.5-fold) corresponding to necrotic cells along with a decrease in the M0 population (∼2.7-fold), corresponding to live cells, both compared with untreated HEK-TRPM4 tet− and HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells (Fig. 3D). However, the proportion of apoptotic cells (M1) was not affected by H2O2. Next, we explored whether native TRPM4 might play a role in H2O2-induced epithelial cell necrosis. Because TRPM4 mRNA has been detected in several cell lines, including HeLa cells (33Prawitt D. Monteilh-Zoller M.K. Brixel L. Spangenberg C. Zabel B. Fleig A. Penner R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15166-15171Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we used these cells as a model. To address this issue we performed extracellular cation replacement experiments and evaluated cell viability with flow cytometry upon exposure to H2O2. In contrast to HEK-TRPM4 tet+ cells, HeLa cells appeared to be more resistant to H2O2 and thus, cell death was detected at concentrations ≥0.8 mm (not shown). As depicted in Fig. 4, a 4-h long exposure to 1 mm H2O2 in the presence of extracellular Na+ triggered a ∼7-fold decrease in viable cells, a ∼5.7-fold increase in apoptotic cells, and a ∼9-fold increase in the necrotic population. Extracellular Na+ replacement by the impermeant cation N-methyl-d-glucamine or sucrose during H2O2 exposure reduced the necrotic (M2) population to control values, yet the apoptotic (M1) population did not differ significantly from that observed under conditions of normal extracellular Na+. In line with these results, the unspecific TRPM4 blocker glibenclamide decreased H2O2-induced necrotic cell death. Because of the lack of specific pharmacological tools available to block TRPM4 as well as to rule out the participation of other ROS-sensitive TRPM4-related channels, such as TRPM2 and TRPM7 in H2O2-induced necrosis in HeLa cells, the participation of endogenous TRPM4 channels in cell death was explored by knocking down the expression of TRPM4 with RNAi tools. For that purpose, HeLa cell lines stably expressing a shRNA against TRPM4 (shRNA-TRPM4) or a scramble sequence (shRNA-SS) (24Launay P. Cheng H. Srivatsan S. Penner R. Fleig A. Kinet J.P. Science. 2004; 306: 1374-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) were generated. To test the efficiency and specificity of the shRNA, we conducted qPCR experiments. As shown in supplemental Fig. S2, expression of TRPM4 was reduced by ∼80% in shRNA-TRPM4 cells compared with cells transfected with shRNA-SS. Additionally, shRNA-TRPM4 proved to be specific for TRPM4 as observed by the lack of effect on TRPM2 and TRPM7 transcripts. Given that a persistent activity of nonselective cation channels would eventually reduce membrane potential, we studied the effect of H2O2 on the membrane potential in HeLa cells. To that end, current clamp recordings were performed. As illustrated in Fig. 5A, the resting membrane potential of wild type, shRNA-SS, and shRNA-TRPM4 HeLa cells under basal conditions were similar, however, upon continuous exposure to 1 mm H2O2, shRNA-SS HeLa cells as well as wild type HeLa cells gradually depolarized reaching values close to 0 mV. In contrast, shRNA-TRPM4 HeLa cells maintained their resting membrane potential. The progressive collapse of the membrane potential observed in wild type and shRNA-SS HeLa cells exposed to H2O2 was paralleled by a significant increase in cell volume (Fig. 5B). Loss of membrane potential and thus, normal ion gradients would have a profound impact on cell function, particularly cell viability. Therefore, if TRPM4 plays a role in H2O2-induced necrosis, it can be anticipated that shRNA-TRPM4 HeLa cells would become relatively resistant to H2O2. As shown in Fig. 6A, necrosis was sig"

https://openalex.org/W2016075369,"Background From the first case reports of pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 it was clear that a significant proportion of infected individuals suffered a primary viral pneumonia. The objective of this study was twofold; to assess the utility of the CURB-65 community acquired pneumonia (CAP) severity index in predicting pneumonia severity and ICU admission, and to assess the relative sensitivity of nasopharyngeal versus lower respiratory tract sampling for the detection of pandemic influenza (H1N1) CAP. Methods A retrospective cohort study of 70 patients hospitalised for pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 in an adult tertiary referral hospital. Characteristics evaluated included age, pregnancy status, sex, respiratory signs and symptoms, smoking and alcohol history, CURB-65 score, co-morbidities, disabling sequelae, length of stay and in-hospital mortality outcomes. Laboratory features evaluated included lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein (CRP), nasopharyngeal and lower respiratory tract pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 PCR results. Results Patients with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza CAP differed significantly from those without pneumonia regarding length of stay, need for ICU admission, CRP and the likelihood of disabling sequelae. The CURB-65 score did not predict CAP severity or the need for ICU admission (only 2/11 patients admitted to ICU had CURB-65 scores of 2 or 3). Nasopharyngeal specimens for PCR were only 62.9% sensitive in CAP patients compared to 97.8% sensitivity for lower respiratory tract specimens. Conclusions The CURB-65 score does not predict severe pandemic influenza (H1N1) 2009 CAP or need for ICU admission. Lower respiratory tract specimens should be collected when pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza CAP is suspected."

However, knowledge of the plasticity of the enzyme in solution has remained scant. Thus, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS) was utilized to probe the conformations of ligand-free P450 2B4 and the complex with 4-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (4-CPI) or 1-biphenyl-4-methyl-1H-imidazole (1-PBI). The results of DXMS indicate that the binding of 4-CPI slowed the hydrogen-deuterium exchange rate over the B′- and C-helices and portions of the F-G-helix cassette compared with P450 2B4 in the absence of ligands. In contrast, there was little difference between the ligand-free and 1-PBI-bound exchange sets. In addition, DXMS suggests that the ligand-free P450 2B4 is predominantly open in solution. Interestingly, a new high resolution structure of ligand-free P450 2B4 was obtained in a closed conformation very similar to the 4-CPI complex. Molecular dynamics simulations performed with the closed ligand-free structure as the starting point were used to probe the energetically accessible conformations of P450 2B4. The simulations were found to equilibrate to a conformation resembling the 1-PBI-bound P450 2B4 crystal structure. The results indicate that conformational changes observed in available crystal structures of the promiscuous xenobiotic metabolizing cytochrome P450 2B4 are consistent with its solution structural behavior.

Many individual mammalian cytochromes P450 can accept a wide variety of hydrophobic substrates of differing shapes and sizes and render them more hydrophilic for excretion or subsequent conjugation. In addition to their central role in drug clearance, the ability of mammalian cytochromes P450 to convert various inactive precursors to the respective bioactive compounds makes these enzymes of paramount importance for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries (2Al Omari A. Murry D.J. J. Pharm. Pract. 2007; 20: 206-218Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res.

P450s show the ability to form compact structures around small ligands or empty active sites, as evidenced by P450 2B4 complexed with 1-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazole (1-CPI) or 4-CPI (10Zhao Y. Sun L.

Moreover, some P450s also appear able to alter their conformations to accommodate ligands of greater volume, as seen in P450 2B4 with bifonazole (15Zhao Y. White M.A. Muralidhara B.K. Sun L.

However, because of the formation of a dimer involving coordination of His226 of each monomer with the heme iron of the other monomer, subsequent solution biophysical work and crystallography efforts utilized the internal mutant H226Y.

The interest in the P450 2B subfamily was prompted by some marked species differences in function that could be attributed to relatively few amino acid substitutions (20Zhao Y. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examination of crystal structures of P450 2B4dH reveals plastic regions able to accommodate binding of ligands of a wide range of sizes (15Zhao Y. White M.A. Muralidhara B.K. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Stout C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5973-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these observations were supported by isothermal titration calorimetry (20Zhao Y. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which provided early indications that P450 2B4dH can adopt different conformations in solution upon ligand binding, an ability also seen in P450 3A4 (16Ekroos M. Sjögren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, direct observations of solution behavior have been lacking.Although there is considerable information about static crystal structures of P450 2B4dH complexed with ligands and about thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding, much less is known concerning the plasticity of the dynamic regions of this enzyme in solution. Amide hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), which traditionally utilizes matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI), is an ideal method to determine such solution behavior (21Busenlehner L.S. Armstrong R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2005; 433: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Engen J.R.

Evidence from the previously determined structures of P450 2B4dH and a novel ligand-free crystal structure solved at 1.8 Å resolution allows interpretation of conformational dynamics associated with ligand binding.DISCUSSIONDespite the intense focus in recent years on the ligand recognition and binding step in the P450 catalytic cycle, there is still uncertainty as to how a single enzyme handles a diverse assortment of compounds (65Davydov D.R.

Data from a host of complementary techniques, including NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and crystallography, indicate an integral role of protein dynamics in ligand binding and catalysis for many enzymes, including P450s (38Pochapsky S.S.

The results presented here describe for the first time the use of DXMS to analyze the solution dynamic behavior of a mammalian drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 in the absence and presence of ligands. These results indicate that the snapshots from the various crystal structures of P450 2B4dH provide a good representation of the dynamic solution behavior of this enzyme in the absence or presence of ligands (10Zhao Y.

Additionally, a new ligand-free crystal structure of this protein in an alternate, closed conformation combined with a molecular dynamics simulation show that both the open and closed conformations of ligand-free P450 2B4dH are energetically accessible.Results of DXMS experiments indicate that the amide hydrogens of P450 2B4dH are provided differing solvent protection depending upon the presence or absence of ligand and the identity of that ligand. Peptides covering large portions of the previously identified plastic regions of the protein (15Zhao Y. White M.A. Muralidhara B.K. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Stout C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5973-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), the B′- and C-helices, residues Ile101–Asp134, and the F-G cassette, residues Pro183–Thr255, showed significant slowing in the H-D exchange rate in the presence of 4-CPI compared with the exchange rate of ligand-free P450 2B4dH. These differences are in agreement with changes observed in these plastic regions in the previously reported crystal structures of open ligand-free and 4-CPI-bound P450 2B4dH (supplemental Fig. S2) (11Scott E.E. White M.A. He Y.A. Johnson E.F. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27294-27301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 19Scott E.E. He Y.A. Wester M.R.

Conversely, P450 2B4dH with and without 1-PBI shows little difference in H-D exchange rates across the entire protein. These results indicate that binding of 1-PBI does not increase protection from amide hydrogen exchange for the plastic regions of the protein in the B′-C loop and the F-G cassette but do not contradict the differences in conformation between the crystal structures of P450 2B4dH complexed with 1-PBI and the open ligand-free structure (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). Although DXMS demonstrates that the large majority of P450 2B4dH adopts a more open conformation in the absence of ligand, averaging across the entire population of protein means that closed conformers representing minor populations would not be observed with this method.In contrast to the DXMS results, the new closed crystal structure of ligand-free P450 2B4dH was essentially super-imposable onto the 4-CPI complex, with an overall root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.49 Å in a Cα overlay. The prosthetic heme group bound to Cys436 and the residues previously found within a 5-Å radius of 4-CPI in 2B4dH show minimal changes in orientation between the 4-CPI-bound and closed ligand-free conformations (Fig. 5A). Ile101, Phe206, Phe297, and Val477 show small rearrangements, presumably because of ligand binding, whereas Glu301 flips away from the active site, as seen in the P450 2B6dH-4-CPI (72Gay S.C. Shah M.B. Talakad J.C. Maekawa K. Roberts A.G. Wilderman P.R. Sun L. Yang J.Y. Huelga S.C. Hong W.X. Zhang Q. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2010; 77: 529-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and P450 2B4dH-1-CPI (10Zhao Y. Sun L. Muralidhara B.K. Kumar S. White M.A. Stout C.D. Halpert J.R. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 11559-11567Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) structures. Most of these residues show major differences in orientation between the closed and open ligand-free structures (Fig. 5B). Transitioning between such open and closed states appears to be facilitated by reorientation of the F- and G-helices and the B-C loop. Moreover, the open ligand-free structure forms a dimer via coordination of His226 of each monomer with the heme iron of the other monomer. Such dimer formation was prevented in the subsequent structures and the DXMS studies by mutation of His226 to Tyr. The DXMS studies indicate a predominantly open conformation in the absence of ligand in contrast to the new closed ligand-free crystal structure. The only major difference observed between the closed ligand-free structure and the previously reported 4-CPI-bound complex was in the positioning of the C-D loop, residues Asp134–Arg140 (Fig. 5A, insets). Interestingly, the C-D loop of P450 2B4dH appears to have high solvent accessibility in both the absence and presence of ligands as seen by both DXMS and the difference in arrangement of the loop in the various crystal structures of the enzyme. This finding is interesting in light of recent work investigating interactions between cytochrome P450 2B6 and cytochrome P450 reductase (73Bumpus N.N. Hollenberg P.F. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2010; 104: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking experiments indicate that the C-D loop interacts with cytochrome P450 reductase.The results reported here enabled analysis of structural plasticity of P450 2B4dH in terms of existing models of protein structural dynamics. Koshland's induced fit mechanism postulates changes in enzyme conformation after the binding of a ligand (74Koshland Jr., D.E. Némethy G. Filmer D. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 365-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (2180) Google Scholar). In contrast, Monod-Wyman-Changeaux allostery theory proposes heterogeneity of conformations in solution whereby the ligand induces a change by binding to a specific conformer and affecting the equilibrium of conformers (75Monod J. Wyman J. Changeux J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 12: 88-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (6084) Google Scholar). These two models are represented visually in Scheme 1. Previous reports of ligand interactions with P450 2B4 inferred the induced fit model (18Gay S.C. Sun L. Maekawa K. Halpert J.R. Stout C.D. Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 4762-4771Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Zhao Y. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 2008; 377: 232-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), but recent studies suggest that bacterial P450s exist in multiple conformers in solution, which more closely resembles the Monod-Wyman-Changeaux theory. For example, two ligand-free crystal structures of P450 EryK were reported in markedly different conformations influenced by salt concentration (71Savino C. Montemiglio L.C. Sciara G. Miele A.E. Kendrew S.G. Jemth P. Gianni S. Vallone B. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 29170-29179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and NMR and MD studies of CYP119 suggest multiple conformers in solution (77Lampe J.N. Brandman R. Sivaramakrishnan S. de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9594-9603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Most recently, a crystal structure of P450cam was solved in an open ligand-free conformation (78Lee Y.T. Wilson R.F. Rupniewski I. Goodin D.B. Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3412-3419Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, no evidence has been presented that distinguishes between these two models of ligand binding in mammalian P450s. In the case of P450 EryK, changing salt concentration altered the population distribution of states with high salt shifting the equilibrium to the closed state. The substrate erythromycin D bound more tightly to the closed conformation of the enzyme, indicating involvement of population shift in protein-ligand interactions (71Savino C. Montemiglio L.C.

However, in the case of P450 2B4dH, protein-ligand interactions are most readily explained by induced fit (Scheme 1, path 1). Results from DXMS and MD point to the majority of the protein existing in an open orientation in solution (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Binding of 1-PBI to the open conformation would require little rearrangement, because this is close to the final bound structure (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S2). Conversely, 4-CPI could bind either to an open or closed conformer but most likely interacts with the open conformer, which is the predominant solution form of the enzyme. Although induced fit protein interactions are the most straightforward explanation of these results, there is a possibility that 4-CPI could interact with P450 2B4dH by binding preferentially to a more closed form of the enzyme (Scheme 1, path 2).SCHEME 1Protein ligand interaction models.

Interestingly, a new crystal structure of ligand-free P450 2B4dH was found in a closed conformation that is strikingly different from the previously reported open ligand-free structure. The molecular dynamics simulation allowed for conversion from this closed ligand-free structure to a conformation similar to the 1-PBI-bound and open ligand-free structures. On the whole, utilization of DXMS in structural studies of mammalian drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 demonstrates that movements in the plastic regions of P450 2B4dH in solution are in close accord with the differences seen in available crystal structures of the protein. This finding is supported by the molecular dynamics simulation, thus providing valuable insight into both ligand-independent as well as ligand-dependent mechanisms of protein conformational changes in solution.

Many individual mammalian cytochromes P450 can accept a wide variety of hydrophobic substrates of differing shapes and sizes and render them more hydrophilic for excretion or subsequent conjugation. In addition to their central role in drug clearance, the ability of mammalian cytochromes P450 to convert various inactive precursors to the respective bioactive compounds makes these enzymes of paramount importance for the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries (2Al Omari A. Murry D.J. J. Pharm. Pract. 2007; 20: 206-218Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res.

However, because of the formation of a dimer involving coordination of His226 of each monomer with the heme iron of the other monomer, subsequent solution biophysical work and crystallography efforts utilized the internal mutant H226Y.

The interest in the P450 2B subfamily was prompted by some marked species differences in function that could be attributed to relatively few amino acid substitutions (20Zhao Y. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Examination of crystal structures of P450 2B4dH reveals plastic regions able to accommodate binding of ligands of a wide range of sizes (15Zhao Y. White M.A. Muralidhara B.K. Sun L. Halpert J.R. Stout C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 5973-5981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these observations were supported by isothermal titration calorimetry (20Zhao Y. Halpert J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1770: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which provided early indications that P450 2B4dH can adopt different conformations in solution upon ligand binding, an ability also seen in P450 3A4 (16Ekroos M. Sjögren T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 13682-13687Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). However, direct observations of solution behavior have been lacking.Although there is considerable information about static crystal structures of P450 2B4dH complexed with ligands and about thermodynamic parameters of ligand binding, much less is known concerning the plasticity of the dynamic regions of this enzyme in solution. Amide hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange mass spectrometry (DXMS), which traditionally utilizes matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) or electrospray ionization (ESI), is an ideal method to determine such solution behavior (21Busenlehner L.S.

The binding site of archazolid is presumed to overlap with the binding site of the established plecomacrolide V-ATPase inhibitors bafilomycin and concanamycin in subunit c of the membrane-integral VO complex. Using a semi-synthetic derivative of archazolid for photoaffinity labeling of the V1VO holoenzyme we confirmed binding of archazolid to the VO subunit c.

https://openalex.org/W2133862521,"The key contribution of this work is to introduce a mathematical framework to understand self-organized dynamics in the brain that can explain certain aspects of itinerant behavior. Specifically, we introduce a model based upon the coupling of generalized Lotka-Volterra systems. This coupling is based upon competition for common resources. The system can be regarded as a normal or canonical form for any distributed system that shows self-organized dynamics that entail winnerless competition. Crucially, we will show that some of the fundamental instabilities that arise in these coupled systems are remarkably similar to endogenous activity seen in the brain (using EEG and fMRI). Furthermore, by changing a small subset of the system's parameters we can produce bifurcations and metastable sequential dynamics changing, which bear a remarkable similarity to pathological brain states seen in psychiatry. In what follows, we will consider the coupling of two macroscopic modes of brain activity, which, in a purely descriptive fashion, we will label as cognitive and emotional modes. Our aim is to examine the dynamical structures that emerge when coupling these two modes and relate them tentatively to brain activity in normal and non-normal states."
https://openalex.org/W2134890525,"Fire is frequently used as a land management tool for cattle ranching and annual crops in the Amazon. However, these maintenance fires often escape into surrounding forests, with potentially severe impacts for forest biodiversity. We examined the effect of experimental fires on leaf-litter arthropod abundance in a seasonally-dry forest in the Brazilian Amazon. The study plots (50 ha each) included a thrice-burned forest and an unburned control forest. Pitfall-trap samples were collected at 160 randomly selected points in both plots, with sampling stratified across four intra-annual replicates across the dry and wet seasons, corresponding to 6, 8, 10 and 12 months after the most recent fire. Arthropods were identified to the level of order (separating Formicidae). In order to better understand the processes that determine arthropod abundance in thrice-burned forests, we measured canopy openness, understory density and litter depth. All arthropod taxa were significantly affected by fire and season. In addition, the interactions between burn treatment and season were highly significant for all taxa but Isoptera. The burned plot was characterized by a more open canopy, lower understory density and shallower litter depth. Hierarchical partitioning revealed that canopy openness was the most important factor explaining arthropod order abundances in the thrice-burned plot, whereas all three environmental variables were significant in the unburned control plot. These results reveal the marked impact of recurrent wildfires and seasonality on litter arthropods in this transitional forest, and demonstrate the overwhelming importance of canopy-openness in driving post-fire arthropod abundance."
https://openalex.org/W2070097315,"Hsp90 is an ATP-dependent molecular chaperone, which facilitates the activation and stabilization of hundreds of client proteins in cooperation with a defined set of cofactors. Many client proteins are protein kinases, which are activated and stabilized by Hsp90 in cooperation with the kinase-specific co-chaperone Cdc37. Other Hsp90 co-chaperones, like the ATPase activator Aha1, also are implicated in kinase activation, and it is not yet clear how Cdc37 is integrated into Hsp90 co-chaperone complexes. Here, we studied the interaction between Cdc37, Hsp90, and other Hsp90 co-chaperones from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Nematode Cdc37 binds with high affinity to Hsp90 and strongly inhibits the ATPase activity. In contrast to the human Hsp90 system, we observed binding of Cdc37 to open and closed Hsp90 conformations, potentially reflecting two different binding modes. Using a novel ultracentrifugation setup, which allows accurate analysis of multifactorial protein complexes, we show that cooperative and competitive interactions exist between other co-chaperones and Cdc37-Hsp90 complexes in the C. elegans system. We observed strong competitive interactions between Cdc37 and the co-chaperones p23 and Sti1, whereas the binding of the phosphatase Pph5 and the ATPase activator Aha1 to Cdc37-Hsp90 complexes is possible. The ternary Aha1-Cdc37-Hsp90 complex is disrupted by the nucleotide-induced closing reaction at the N terminus of Hsp90. This implies a carefully regulated exchange process of cofactors during the chaperoning of kinase clients by Hsp90."
https://openalex.org/W2078567325,"The kinetics of phosphoryl exchange involving ATP and ADP have been investigated successfully by in vivo (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy using magnetization transfer. However, magnetization transfer effects seen on the signals of ATP also could arise from intramolecular cross-relaxation. This relaxation process carries information on the association state of ATP in the cell. To disentangle contributions of chemical exchange and cross-relaxation to magnetization transfer effects seen in (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy of skeletal muscle, we performed saturation transfer experiments on wild type and double-mutant mice lacking the cytosolic muscle creatine kinase and adenylate kinase isoforms. We find that cross-relaxation, observed as nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), is responsible for magnetization transfer between ATP phosphates both in wild type and in mutant mice. Analysis of (31)P relaxation properties identifies these effects as transferred NOEs, i.e. underlying this process is an exchange between free cellular ATP and ATP bound to slowly rotating macromolecules. This explains the β-ATP signal decrease upon saturation of the γ-ATP resonance. Although this usually is attributed to β-ADP ↔ β-ATP phosphoryl exchange, we did not detect an effect of this exchange on the β-ATP signal as expected for free [ADP], derived from the creatine kinase equilibrium reaction. This indicates that in resting muscle, conditions prevail that prevent saturation of β-ADP spins and puts into question the derivation of free [ADP] from the creatine kinase equilibrium. We present a model, matching the experimental result, for ADP ↔ ATP exchange, in which ADP is only transiently present in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W2114293579,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an αβγ heterotrimer conserved throughout evolution and important for energy sensing in all eukaryote cells. AMPK controls metabolism and various cellular events in response to both hormones and changes in cellular energy status. The γ subunit senses intracellular energy status through the competitive binding of AMP and ATP. We show here that targeted disruption of the mouse AMPKγ1 gene (Prkag1) causes regenerative hemolytic anemia by increasing the sequestration of abnormal erythrocytes. Prkag1(-/-) mice displayed splenomegaly and iron accumulation due to compensatory splenic erythropoiesis and erythrophagocytosis. Moreover, AMPKγ1-deficient erythrocytes were highly resistant to osmotic hemolysis and poorly deformable in response to increasing shear stress, consistent with greater membrane rigidity. No change in cytoskeletal protein composition was observed; however, the phosphorylation level of adducin, a protein promoting the binding of spectrin to actin, was higher in AMPKγ1-deficient erythrocytes. Together, these results demonstrate that AMPKγ1 subunit is required for the maintenance of erythrocyte membrane elasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1973562333,"Protocols were developed to automate image analysis and to track the movement of thousands of vesicular compartments in live cells. Algorithms were used to discriminate among different types of movement (e.g. random, caged, and directed). We applied these tools to investigate the steady-state distribution and movement of lytic granules (LG) in live natural killer (NK) cells by high-speed 3-dimensional (3D) spinning disc confocal and 2-dimensional total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Both mouse NK cells and a human NK cell line deficient in the small GTPase Rab27a were examined. The unbiased analysis of large datasets led to the following observations and conclusions. The majority of LG in the cytosol and at the plasma membrane of unstimulated NK cells are mobile. The use of inhibitors indicated that movement in the cytosol required microtubules but not actin, whereas movement at the plasma membrane required both. Rab27a deficiency resulted in fewer LG, and in a reduced fraction of mobile LG, at the plasma membrane. In contrast, loss of Rab27a increased the fraction of mobile LG and the extent of their movement in the cytosol. Therefore, in addition to its documented role in LG delivery to the plasma membrane, Rab27a may restrict LG movement in the cytosol."
https://openalex.org/W1990832172,"The type IIb class of plant Ca(2+)-ATPases contains a unique N-terminal extension that encompasses a calmodulin (CaM) binding domain and an auto-inhibitory domain. Binding of Ca(2+)-CaM to this region can release auto-inhibition and activates the calcium pump. Using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, we have determined the solution structure of the complex of a plant CaM isoform with the CaM-binding domain of the well characterized Ca(2+)-ATPase BCA1 from cauliflower. The complex has a rather elongated structure in which the two lobes of CaM do not contact each other. The anchor residues Trp-23 and Ile-40 form a 1-8-18 interaction motif. Binding of Ca(2+)-CaM gives rise to the induction of two helical parts in this unique target peptide. The two helical portions are connected by a highly positively charged bend region, which represents a relatively fixed angle and positions the two lobes of CaM in an orientation that has not been seen before in any complex structure of calmodulin. The behavior of the complex was further characterized by heteronuclear NMR dynamics measurements of the isotope-labeled protein and peptide. These data suggest a unique calcium-driven activation mechanism for BCA1 and other plant Ca(2+)-ATPases that may also explain the action of calcium-CaM on some other target enzymes. Moreover, CaM activation of plant Ca(2+)-ATPases seems to occur in an organelle-specific manner."
https://openalex.org/W2059115911,"We have isolated an enzyme classified as chlorogenate: glucarate caffeoyltransferase (CGT) from seedlings of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that catalyzes the formation of caffeoylglucarate and caffeoylgalactarate using chlorogenate (5-O-caffeoylquinate) as acyl donor. Peptide sequences obtained by trypsin digestion and spectrometric sequencing were used to isolate the SlCGT cDNA encoding a protein of 380 amino acids with a putative targeting signal of 24 amino acids indicating an entry of the SlCGT into the secretory pathway. Immunogold electron microscopy revealed the localization of the enzyme in the apoplastic space of tomato leaves. Southern blot analysis of genomic cDNA suggests that SlCGT is encoded by a single-copy gene. The SlCGT cDNA was functionally expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves and proved to confer chlorogenate-dependent caffeoyltransferase activity in the presence of glucarate. Sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence identified the protein unexpectedly as a GDSL lipase-like protein, representing a new member of the SGNH protein superfamily. Lipases of this family employ a catalytic triad of Ser-Asp-His with Ser as nucleophile of the GDSL motif. Site-directed mutagenesis of each residue of the assumed respective SlCGT catalytic triad, however, indicated that the catalytic triad of the GDSL lipase is not essential for SlCGT enzymatic activity. SlCGT is therefore the first example of a GDSL lipase-like protein that lost hydrolytic activity and has acquired a completely new function in plant metabolism, functioning in secondary metabolism as acyltransferase in synthesis of hydroxycinnamate esters by employing amino acid residues different from the lipase catalytic triad."
https://openalex.org/W2090153891,"Relatively little is known about the degree of inter-specific variability in visual scanning strategies in species with laterally placed eyes (e.g., birds). This is relevant because many species detect prey while perching; therefore, head movement behavior may be an indicator of prey detection rate, a central parameter in foraging models. We studied head movement strategies in three diurnal raptors belonging to the Accipitridae and Falconidae families.We used behavioral recording of individuals under field and captive conditions to calculate the rate of two types of head movements and the interval between consecutive head movements. Cooper's Hawks had the highest rate of regular head movements, which can facilitate tracking prey items in the visually cluttered environment they inhabit (e.g., forested habitats). On the other hand, Red-tailed Hawks showed long intervals between consecutive head movements, which is consistent with prey searching in less visually obstructed environments (e.g., open habitats) and with detecting prey movement from a distance with their central foveae. Finally, American Kestrels have the highest rates of translational head movements (vertical or frontal displacements of the head keeping the bill in the same direction), which have been associated with depth perception through motion parallax. Higher translational head movement rates may be a strategy to compensate for the reduced degree of eye movement of this species.Cooper's Hawks, Red-tailed Hawks, and American Kestrels use both regular and translational head movements, but to different extents. We conclude that these diurnal raptors have species-specific strategies to gather visual information while perching. These strategies may optimize prey search and detection with different visual systems in habitat types with different degrees of visual obstruction."
https://openalex.org/W1993001984,"Integrins are postulated to undergo structural rearrangement from a low affinity bent conformer to a high affinity extended conformer upon activation. However, some reports have shown that a bent conformer is capable of binding a ligand, whereas another report has shown that integrin extension does not absolutely lead to activation. To clarify whether integrin affinity is indeed regulated by the so-called switchblade-like movement, we have engineered a series of mutant αIIbβ3 integrins that are constrained specifically in either a bent or an extended conformation. These mutant αIIbβ3 integrins were expressed in mammalian cells, and fibrinogen binding to these cells was examined. The bent integrins were created through the introduction of artificial disulfide bridges in the β-head/β-tail interface. Cells expressing bent integrins all failed to bind fibrinogen unless pretreated with DTT to disrupt the disulfide bridges. The extended integrins were created by introducing N-glycosylation sites in amino acid residues located close to the α-genu, where the integrin legs fold backward. Among these mutants, activation was maximized in one integrin with an N-glycosylation site located behind the α-genu. This extension-induced activation was completely blocked when the swing-out of the hybrid domain was prevented. These results suggest that the bent and extended conformers represent low affinity and high affinity conformers, respectively, and that extension-induced activation depends on the swing-out of the hybrid domain. Taken together, these results are consistent with the current hypothesis that integrin affinity is regulated by the switchblade-like movement of the integrin legs."
https://openalex.org/W2112299240,"Mps1 is a protein kinase that regulates normal mitotic progression and the spindle checkpoint in response to spindle damage. The levels of Mps1 are relatively low in cells during interphase but elevated in mitosis or upon activation of the spindle checkpoint, although the dynamic range of Mps1 expression and the Mps1 catalytic mechanism have not been carefully characterized. Our recent structural studies of the Mps1 kinase domain revealed that the carboxyl-terminal tail region of Mps1 is unstructured, raising the question of whether this region has any functional role in Mps1 catalysis. Here we first determined the cellular abundance of Mps1 during cell cycle progression and found that Mps1 levels vary between 60,000 per cell in early G(1) and 110,000 per cell during mitosis. We studied phosphorylation of a number of Mps1 substrates in vitro and in culture cells. Unexpectedly, we found that the unstructured carboxyl-terminal region of Mps1 plays an essential role in substrate recruitment. Kinetics studies using the purified recombinant wild type and mutant kinases indicate that the carboxyl-terminal tail is largely dispensable for autophosphorylation of Mps1 but critical for trans-phosphorylation of substrates in vitro and in cultured cells. Mps1 mutant without the unstructured tail region is defective in mediating spindle assembly checkpoint activation. Our results underscore the importance of the unstructured tail region of Mps1 in kinase activation."
https://openalex.org/W2042411903,"Inward rectifier K(+) (Kir) channels are activated by phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP(2)), but G protein-gated Kir (K(G)) channels further require either G protein βγ subunits (Gβγ) or intracellular Na(+) for their activation. To reveal the mechanism(s) underlying this regulation, we compared the crystal structures of the cytoplasmic domain of K(G) channel subunit Kir3.2 obtained in the presence and the absence of Na(+). The Na(+)-free Kir3.2, but not the Na(+)-plus Kir3.2, possessed an ionic bond connecting the N terminus and the CD loop of the C terminus. Functional analyses revealed that the ionic bond between His-69 on the N terminus and Asp-228 on the CD loop, which are known to be critically involved in Gβγ- and Na(+)-dependent activation, lowered PIP(2) sensitivity. The conservation of these residues within the K(G) channel family indicates that the ionic bond is a character that maintains the channels in a closed state by controlling the PIP(2) sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2052230390,"Background NPM1 gene at chromosome 5q35 is involved in recurrent translocations in leukemia and lymphoma. It also undergoes mutations in 60% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases with normal karyotype. The incidence and significance of NPM1 deletion in human leukemia have not been elucidated. Methodology and Principal Findings Bone marrow samples from 145 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML were included in this study. Cytogenetically 43 cases had isolated 5q-, 84 cases had 5q- plus other changes and 18 cases had complex karyotype without 5q deletion. FISH and direct sequencing investigated the NPM1 gene. NPM1 deletion was an uncommon event in the “5q- syndrome” but occurred in over 40% of cases with high risk MDS/AML with complex karyotypes and 5q loss. It originated from large 5q chromosome deletions. Simultaneous exon 12 mutations were never found. NPM1 gene status was related to the pattern of complex cytogenetic aberrations. NPM1 haploinsufficiency was significantly associated with monosomies (p<0.001) and gross chromosomal rearrangements, i.e., markers, rings, and double minutes (p<0.001), while NPM1 disomy was associated with structural changes (p = 0.013). Interestingly, in complex karyotypes with 5q- TP53 deletion and/or mutations are not specifically associated with NPM1 deletion. Conclusions and Significance NPM1/5q35 deletion is a consistent event in MDS/AML with a 5q-/-5 in complex karyotypes. NPM1 deletion and NPM1 exon 12 mutations appear to be mutually exclusive and are associated with two distinct cytogenetic subsets of MDS and AML."

https://openalex.org/W2065711651,"With its incredible strength and toughness, spider dragline silk is widely lauded for its impressive material properties. Dragline silk is composed of two structural proteins, MaSp1 and MaSp2, which are encoded by members of the spidroin gene family. While previous studies have characterized the genes that encode the constituent proteins of spider silks, nothing is known about the physical location of these genes. We determined karyotypes and sex chromosome organization for the widow spiders, Latrodectus hesperus and L. geometricus (Araneae, Theridiidae). We then used fluorescence in situ hybridization to map the genomic locations of the genes for the silk proteins that compose the remarkable spider dragline. These genes included three loci for the MaSp1 protein and the single locus for the MaSp2 protein. In addition, we mapped a MaSp1 pseudogene. All the MaSp1 gene copies and pseudogene localized to a single chromosomal region while MaSp2 was located on a different chromosome of L. hesperus. Using probes derived from L. hesperus, we comparatively mapped all three MaSp1 loci to a single region of a L. geometricus chromosome. As with L. hesperus, MaSp2 was found on a separate L. geometricus chromosome, thus again unlinked to the MaSp1 loci. These results indicate orthology of the corresponding chromosomal regions in the two widow genomes. Moreover, the occurrence of multiple MaSp1 loci in a conserved gene cluster across species suggests that MaSp1 proliferated by tandem duplication in a common ancestor of L. geometricus and L. hesperus. Unequal crossover events during recombination could have given rise to the gene copies and could also maintain sequence similarity among gene copies over time. Further comparative mapping with taxa of increasing divergence from Latrodectus will pinpoint when the MaSp1 duplication events occurred and the phylogenetic distribution of silk gene linkage patterns."
https://openalex.org/W1991766132,"Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) disease is a genetically inherited multi-lipid storage disorder with impaired efflux of cholesterol from lysosomal storage organelles.The effect of screen-selected cholesterol lowering compounds on the major sterol pathways was studied in CT60 mutant CHO cells lacking NPC1 protein. Each of the selected chemicals decreases cholesterol in the lysosomal storage organelles of NPC1 mutant cells through one or more of the following mechanisms: increased cholesterol efflux from the cell, decreased uptake of low-density lipoproteins, and/or increased levels of cholesteryl esters. Several chemicals promote efflux of cholesterol to extracellular acceptors in both non-NPC and NPC1 mutant cells. The uptake of low-density lipoprotein-derived cholesterol is inhibited by some of the studied compounds.Results herein provide the information for prioritized further studies in identifying molecular targets of the chemicals. This approach proved successful in the identification of seven chemicals as novel inhibitors of lysosomal acid lipase (Rosenbaum et al, Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009, 1791:1155-1165)."
https://openalex.org/W2013280836,"Several firing patterns experimentally observed in neural populations have been successfully correlated to animal behavior. Population bursting, hereby regarded as a period of high firing rate followed by a period of quiescence, is typically observed in groups of neurons during behavior. Biophysical membrane-potential models of single cell bursting involve at least three equations. Extending such models to study the collective behavior of neural populations involves thousands of equations and can be very expensive computationally. For this reason, low dimensional population models that capture biophysical aspects of networks are needed. \noindent The present paper uses a firing-rate model to study mechanisms that trigger and stop transitions between tonic and phasic population firing. These mechanisms are captured through a two-dimensional system, which can potentially be extended to include interactions between different areas of the nervous system with a small number of equations. The typical behavior of midbrain dopaminergic neurons in the rodent is used as an example to illustrate and interpret our results. \noindent The model presented here can be used as a building block to study interactions between networks of neurons. This theoretical approach may help contextualize and understand the factors involved in regulating burst firing in populations and how it may modulate distinct aspects of behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2005759587,"We have previously reported that thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) exhibits intrinsic proteolytic activity toward large peptides. The structural basis for this observation was clarified by the crystal structures of human and bovine TAFI. These structures evinced a significant rotation of the pro-domain away from the catalytic moiety when compared with other pro-carboxypeptidases, thus enabling access of large peptide substrates to the active site cleft. Here, we further investigated the flexible nature of the pro-domain and demonstrated that TAFI forms productive complexes with protein carboxypeptidase inhibitors from potato, leech, and tick (PCI, LCI, and TCI, respectively). We determined the crystal structure of the bovine TAFI-TCI complex, revealing that the pro-domain was completely displaced from the position observed in the TAFI structure. It protruded into the bulk solvent and was disordered, whereas TCI occupied the position previously held by the pro-domain. The authentic nature of the presently studied TAFI-inhibitor complexes was supported by the trimming of the C-terminal residues from the three inhibitors upon complex formation. This finding suggests that the inhibitors interact with the active site of TAFI in a substrate-like manner. Taken together, these data show for the first time that TAFI is able to form a bona fide complex with protein carboxypeptidase inhibitors. This underlines the unusually flexible nature of the pro-domain and implies a possible mechanism for regulation of TAFI intrinsic proteolytic activity in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2048821366,"Disruption of <i>HpURE2</i> resulted in a low expression of genes encoding nitrate-assimilatory proteins; sensitivity to Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Cd<sup>2+</sup>; no induction of <i>ENA1</i>; low levels of the GATA-type transcription factor Gat1; and low intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Gat1 levels were also very low in a Δ<i>cnb1</i> mutant lacking the regulatory subunit of calcineurin. The strain Δ<i>ure2</i> was very sensitive to the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 and displayed several phenotypes reminiscent of Δ<i>cnb1</i>. The reporter <i>4xCDRE-lacZ</i>, containing calcineurin-dependent response elements in its promoter, revealed that calcineurin activation was reduced in <i>Hp</i>Δ<i>ure2</i>. Expression of <i>ScURE2</i> in Δ<i>ure2</i> rescued nitrogen catabolite repression and Cd<sup>2+</sup> tolerance but not those phenotypes depending on calcineurin activation, such as salt tolerance and nitrate assimilation gene derepression. <i>Hp</i>Δ<i>ure2</i> showed an increased expression of the gene <i>PMR1</i> encoding the Golgi Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase, whereas that of <i>PMC1</i> encoding the vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase remained unaltered. <i>PMR1</i> up-regulation was abolished by deletion of the GATA-type transcription factor <i>GAT2</i> in a <i>Hp</i>Δ<i>ure2</i> genetic background, and normal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were recovered.

https://openalex.org/W2069082132,"TFIIB is the only factor within the multimegadalton transcription complex that is obligatorily required to undergo dissociation and re-association with each round of mRNA transcription. Here we show that a six-amino acid human TFIIB tip region is needed for appropriate levels of serine 5 C-terminal domain phosphorylation and mRNA capping and for retention of the required elongation factor TFIIF. We suggest that the broad functions of this tiny region are used to suppress transcription noise by restricting functional RNA synthesis from non-promoter sites on the genome, which will not contain TFIIB."
