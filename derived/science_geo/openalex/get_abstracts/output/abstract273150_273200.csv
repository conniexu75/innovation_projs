https://openalex.org/W2057091716,"Samarium-neodymium and rubidium-strontium isotopic systematics together with plausible assumptions regarding the geochemical evlution of continental crust material, have been used to ascertain the times at which segments of continental crust were formed. Analyses of composites from the Canadian Shield representing portions of the Superior, Slave, and Churchill structural provinces indicate that these provinces were all formed within the period 2.5 to 2.7 aeons. It has been possible to determine the mean age of sediment provenances, as studies of sedimentary rocks suggest that the samarium-neodymium isotopic system is not substantially disturbed during sedimentation or diagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2042513092,"A new method is described for studying, reproducibly, the kinetics of crystallization of minerals under conditions of constant solution composition even at very low supersaturations. For calcium phosphates the method provides direct evidence for octacalcium phosphate as the precursor to hydroxyapatite precipitation at physiological pH."
https://openalex.org/W2057656083,The butterfly Battus philenor forms search images for leaf shape when searching for its two larval host plants in southeast Texas. This behavior increases the rate of discovery of host plants and permits females to track changes in relative host plant suitability for larval growth. Apostatic selection resulting from search image formation is a likely explanation for divergence in leaf shape by the two host plants.
https://openalex.org/W2016302429,"Slow-spreading (<35 millimeters per year) mid-ocean ridges are dominated by segmented, asymmetric, rifted depressions like continental rifts. Fast-spreading ridges display symmetric, elevated volcanic edifices that vary in shape and size along axis. Deep earthquakes, major normal faults, and exposures of lower crustal rocks are common only along slow-spreading ridges. These contrasting features suggest that mechanical deformation is far more important in crustal formation at slow-spreading ridges than at fast-spreading ridges. New seismic images suggest that the nature and scale of segmentation of slow-spreading ridges is integral to the deformational process and not to magmatic processes that may control segmentation on fast-spreading ridges."
https://openalex.org/W2002325083,"Amphipods were collected from an ocean depth of 5700 meters in a windowed pressure-retaining trap, kept alive in the trap for as long as 9 days aboard ship, and transported to a land laboratory. Observations suggest that the animals can easily tolerate decompressions of 29 percent and briefly of 70 percent of the value of 580 bars, the pressure of their natural habitat. The average pleopod beat frequency was 106 beats per minute. Evidence suggests that food (fish bait) can have at least a 4-day residence time in the gut of these animals."
https://openalex.org/W1989834196,"Excavations into the Australian swamp of Lancefield show that a bone bed dated at 26,000 years ago contains perhaps 10,000 giant extinct animals. Associated artifacts suggest that humans were in the area, but the direct cause of death of the animals is, on present evidence, not explicable. Such a recent date for the classic megafauna shows that it was living together with humans for at least 7000 years in southeast Australia. This enduring association argues against a catastrophic and rapid overkill in the Australian Pleistocene."
https://openalex.org/W2008017337,"In the early stages of cellular interaction between the symbionts of Lecidea albocaerulescens, the phycobiont produced an extracellular sheath which bound to it hyphae of the mycobiont. Such a sheath may be a means by which the symbionts recognize each other. Hyphae of the mycobiont formed flattened appressoria as they grew over the algal cells and in this way secured the autotrophic population necessary for the development of a lichen thallus."
https://openalex.org/W2023984358,"Insights from dendrochronology have provided a new seasonal predictor for air pollution meteorology. In the San Francisco Bay Area summer ozone excesses over the federal ozone standard are correlated (correlation coefficient r = .87) with precipitation for the two preceding winters, a factor related to tree-ring width in a precipitation-stressed climate. The hypothesis that reactive hydrocarbon emissions from vegetative biomass affects these ozone excesses was supported by a similar correlation between summer hydrocarbon average maximums and the two-winter precipitation factor, reaching r = .88 at suburban stations. A weak tendency for hot summers to follow wet winters (in 16 years of California data) explains only a minor part of the ozone-rain relationship in multiple correlations."
https://openalex.org/W1983196043,"Degraded lignin compounds have been identified in Triassic age (about 200 million years) silicified wood from the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. The pyrolysis products from black carbonaceous samples include carbon dioxide, low-molecular-weight alkanes and alkenes, benzene, alkyl-substituted benzenes, phenol, cresol, xylenols, indenes, benzofurans, trimethylindanone, and naphthalenes. These compounds are also the primary pyrolyzates of modern lignin above 500 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1969783005,"Since at least the late Mesozoic, the abundance of terrestrial vegetation has been the major factor in atmospheric carbon dioxideloxygen fluctuations. Of modern ecosystem types occupying more than 1 percent of the earth's surface, productivity/area ratios of terrestrial ecosystems (excepting tundra and alpine meadow, desert scrub, and rock, ice, and sand) exceed those of marine ecosystems and probably have done so for much of late Phanerozoic time. Reduction of terrestrial ecosystems during marine transgression would decrease the world primary productivity, thus increasing the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and decreasing the oxygen concentration. Regression would produce opposite effects."
https://openalex.org/W2036994322,"The Copernicus Orbiting Astronomical Observatory was used to obtain measurements of Mars Lyman-alpha (1215.671-angstrom) emission at the solar minimum, which has resulted in the first information on atomic hydrogen concentrations in the upper atmosphere of Mars at the solar minimum. The Copernicus measurements, coupled with the Viking in situ measurements of the temperature (170 degrees +/- 30 degrees K) of the upper atmosphere of Mars, indicate that the atomic hydrogen number density at the exobase of Mars (250 kilometers) is about 60 times greater than that deduced from Mariner 6 and 7 Lyman-alpha measurements obtained during a period of high solar activity. The Copernicus results are consistent with Hunten's hypothesis of the diffusion-limited escape of atomic hydrogen from Mars."

https://openalex.org/W2041923527,"On 15 August, a Russian research vessel, the Viktor Buynitskiy, will leave the Norwegian port of Kirkenes packed with surveying equipment and scientists. Its mission will be to check out one of the more alarming environmental stories that have drifted out of the former Soviet Union since its collapse last fall: a claim that the Arctic is being polluted by tons of radioactive waste spilled or dumped by the Soviet military. Since May, US officials have been searching for information to confirm or disprove the reports about Russian radiation. The basic concern, is as follows: Arctic waters - and, potentially, fisheries near Norway and Alaska - are in danger of being contaminated by radioactive isotopes leaking from two major sources. One is the area around Novaya Zemlya, an archipelago where the Soviets conducted bomb tests, scuttled submarines, and disposed of waste canisters. The other is freshwater runoff into the Arctic Ocean - including the Ob and Yenisey Rivers - carrying isotopes from weapons plants, waste ponds, and accident sites in Siberia."

https://openalex.org/W2034972672,"The Physics Interviewing Project assists graduate physics departments in evaluating foreign applicants. Supported by some 20 universities, two interviewers, both working scientists, travel abroad and interview students individually for about 1 hour each. Prospective teaching assistants are rated on physics knowledge, problem-solving ability, and English language proficiency. Ratings on all interviewees are sent to all supporting schools and other schools as requested. The Project aids able students from countries that have no physics Ph.D. programs (Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) to obtain assistantships and Ph.D.'s abroad, assists in the technological development of those countries, and helps U.S. schools in selecting the most promising foreign candidates. A similar program should be beneficial in other sciences."
