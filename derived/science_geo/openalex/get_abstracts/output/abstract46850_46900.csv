https://openalex.org/W2070972951,"Local increases in neuronal activity within the brain lead to dilation of blood vessels and to increased regional cerebral blood flow. Increases in extracellular potassium concentration are known to dilate cerebral arterioles. Recent studies have suggested that the potassium released by active neurons is transported through astrocytic glial cells and released from their endfeet onto blood vessels. The results of computer simulations of potassium dynamics in the brain indicate that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet raises perivascular potassium concentration much more rapidly and to higher levels than does diffusion of potassium through extracellular space, particularly when the site of a potassium increase is some distance from the vessel wall. On the basis of this finding, it is proposed that the release of potassium from astrocyte endfeet plays an important role in regulating regional cerebral blood flow in response to changes in neuronal activity."

https://openalex.org/W2027598184,"Many mandibulate insects that feed on milkweeds, or other latex-producing plants, cut leaf veins before feeding distal to the cuts. Vein cutting blocks latex flow to intended feeding sites and can be viewed as an insect counteradaptation to the plant's defensive secretion. Experimental vein severance renders milkweed leaves edible to generalist herbivores that do not show vein-cutting behaviors and ordinarily ignore milkweeds in nature."

https://openalex.org/W2000666872,"Toxic chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins are known to be formed in incinerators that burn municipal refuse. These compounds were synthesized by surface-catalyzed reactions on fly ash particulates taken from incinerators. Dioxins were produced catalytically from chlorinated phenol precursors, from non-chlorinated compounds that were chemically dissimilar to dioxins, and from reaction of phenol with inorganic chlorides. The relative amounts of dioxins formed from [13C6]pentachlorophenol with different fly ashes that had been cleaned of all organic compounds corresponded well with those amounts originally found on the samples as received from the incinerators. The optimum temperature range for the formation of dioxins from pentachlorophenol was 250 degrees to 350 degrees C."
https://openalex.org/W1657628981,"A cDNA clone encoding a human cellular thyroid hormone binding protein (p55) has been isolated. The cDNA sequence contains a single open reading frame of 1524 nucleotides which encodes a polypeptide of 491 amino acids and a signal sequence of 17 amino acids. Two partial protein sequences determined from the purified protein correspond to the deduced amino acid sequence. In vitro translation of mRNA prepared by transcription of the cDNA clone yielded a protein of the size of an unprocessed precursor (Mr 57,000) as well as smaller fragments which were immunoprecipitated by antibodies against p55. The isolation of the cDNA clone should allow elucidation of the cellular function of this thyroid hormone binding protein which is present in the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope."

https://openalex.org/W2017579442,"Grafts of the anterior limb bud introduced at embryonic day 4 between histoincompatible chick embryos were subject to chronic, mild rejection beginning from several weeks to several months after birth. In contrast, quail wing buds similarly grafted into chickens started to be rejected at the first or second week after birth and finally autoamputated. Embryonic thymus epithelium from donor quail (before it had been colonized by hemopoietic cells) was grafted into chicks. A chimeric thymic epithelial stroma was generated in which the lymphocytes of the chick acquired the capacity to recognize the grafted limb as self either permanently or for a protracted period of time. In such thymic chimeras the grafted wings were not rejected."

https://openalex.org/W1989052124,"In order to identify the genetic factors associated with the radiation-resistant human laryngeal carcinoma cell line (SQ-20B), tumor cell DNA was transfected into NIH/3T3 cells. A high incidence (six out of six) of raf sequences was found in transfected NIH/3T3 clones and the tumorigenic potential of SQ-20B DNA could be linked to genomic fragments that represent most of the kinase domain of human c-raf-1. An apparently unaltered 3.5-kilobase pair (kb) human c-raf transcript was identified in SQ-20B cells but was not observed in the transfected NIH/3T3 cell clones. Two new transcripts (4.2 kb and 2.6 kb) were found in tumorigenic clones; the large transcript was missing in a very poorly tumorigenic clone. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that the normal autosomes of chromosome 3 were absent in SQ-20B karyotypes and had formed apparently stable marker chromosomes. Unlike the recipient NIH/3T3 cell line, 30 percent of the transformed clone-1 metaphases had minute and double-minute chromosomes representative of amplified DNA sequences. The frequency of the c-raf-1 identification by NIH/3T3 transfection of SQ-20B DNA suggests the presence of some genetic abnormality within this locus."

https://openalex.org/W2102131815,Small linear DNA molecules containing histone octamers (nucleosome cores) are transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase with only slightly lower efficiency than naked DNA templates. The position of the histone octamer on the DNA remains unchanged even after multiple passages by the polymerase. The histone octamer is not released even transiently from the DNA by polymerase transit. We conclude that histone octamers do not impede transcription elongation.
https://openalex.org/W1979511611,"We have examined DNA repair in the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in cultured human cells treated with 4'-hydroxymethyl-4,5',8-trimethylpsoralen (HMT) using a newly developed assay for interstrand DNA cross-linking in defined genomic sequences. Within 24 hr, 80% of the cross-links, but only 45% of the monoadducts, were removed from a 32 kb transcribed sequence, demonstrating that repair efficiency in an active human gene varies with the nature of the damage. HMT monoadducts were also detected in the replicated DHFR sequence at frequencies indicating little interference with replication. The existence of cross-linkable monoadduct sites in the replicated DNA implies strand continuity opposite those sites and a relatively error-free mechanism of bypass. Translesion replication could circumvent transcription blockage in a damaged gene. These findings have important implications for mechanisms of mutagenesis and DNA lesion tolerance in human cells."

https://openalex.org/W1981259408,"The discovery of the first definitively correlated earliest Jurassic (200 million years before present) tetrapod assemblage (Fundy basin, Newark Supergroup, Nova Scotia) allows reevaluation of the duration of the Triassic-Jurassic tetrapod extinction event. Present are tritheledont and mammal-like reptiles, prosauropod, theropod, and ornithischian dinosaurs, protosuchian and sphenosuchian crocodylomorphs, sphenodontids, and hybodont, semionotid, and palaeonisciform fishes. All of the families are known from Late Triassic and Jurassic strata from elsewhere; however, pollen and spore, radiometric, and geochemical correlation indicate an early Hettangian age for these assemblages. Because all ""typical Triassic"" forms are absent from these assemblages, most Triassic-Jurassic tetrapod extinctions occurred before this time and without the introduction of new families. As was previously suggested by studies of marine invertebrates, this pattern is consistent with a global extinction event at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. The Manicouagan impact structure of Quebec provides dates broadly compatible with the Triassic-Jurassic boundary and, following the impact theory of mass extinctions, may be implicated in the cause."

https://openalex.org/W2004382481,"Synthesis of α- and β-tubulin is controlled in animal cells by a novel autoregulatory mechanism: the concentration of unpolymerized subunits specifies the level of tubulin mRNAs. Using transient DNA transfection, we have localized the sequences that identify a β-tubulin RNA as a substrate for autoregulation. Insertion of as few as 106 nucleotides (57 bases of 5′ untranslated region and 49 coding nucleotides) from a β-tubulin gene into a thymidine kinase gene is sufficient to make expression of the resultant chimeric RNA regulated as if it were an authentic β-tubulin mRNA. Furthermore, all 5′ untranslated region sequences can be deleted without disrupting regulation. We conclude that this novel autoregulatory pathway is specified by cytoplasmic events that modulate mRNA stability through sequences lying within the first 16 translated codons of a β-tubulin mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2038843255,"A monoclonal antibody elicited by a transition-state analog that is representative of an intramolecular six-membered ring cyclization reaction acted as a stereospecific, enzyme-like catalyst for the appropriate substrate. Formation of a single enantiomer of a delta-lactone from the corresponding racemic delta-hydroxyester was accelerated by the antibody by about a factor of 170, which permitted isolation of the lactone in an enantiomeric excess of about 94 percent. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of catalytic-antibody generation for chemical transformations that require stereochemical control."
https://openalex.org/W1513221428,"A stable nonreducible trifunctional cross-linking amino acid has been isolated from mature bovine skin collagen fibrils. Previous cross-link peptide isolations and amino acid analyses indicate the compound has properties identical with those of hydroxyaldolhistidine. Its newly proposed structure was verified using fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry, and 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. The data indicated that the cross-link consists of the prosthetic groups from one residue each of histidine, hydroxylysine, and lysine. The 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance data indicated that imidazole C-2 of histidine is linked to C-6 of norleucine (epsilon-deaminated lysine residue) which in turn is linked to the C-6 amino group of hydroxylysine. Based on the trivial names for other cross-linking residues found in collagen and elastin it was given the name histidinohydroxylysinonorleucine. In vitro incubation studies for up to 24 weeks, in aqueous solution at physiological pH and ionic strength, using 6-month-old bovine embryo skin demonstrated a one-to-one stoichiometric relationship between the disappearance of the labile reducible bifunctional cross-link dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine and the appearance of histidinohydroxylsinonorleucine. These results can partially explain the previously observed disappearance of dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine with chronological age."
https://openalex.org/W2017343440,"We have identified the species-nonspecific factor required for mouse rDNA transcription, factor C, as an activated subform of RNA polymerase I. C is an RNA polymerase I since it copurifies with bulk polymerase I activity on the three chromatographic columns used to achieve a virtually homogenous preparation of polymerase I, as well as on four additional matrices; it is quantitatively neutralized as well as immunoprecipitated by two different types of anti-polymerase I antibodies; and it has thermal lability identical to that of bulk polymerase I. However, C is clearly distinct from bulk polymerase I in its ability to participate in the stable rDNA transcription complex and to catalyze accurate initiation of rRNA synthesis. It also has a greater sedimentation coefficient than bulk polymerase I. Furthermore, this activated polymerase subform is specifically lacking in extracts of cells in which rDNA transcription was down-regulated because of cycloheximide treatment or attainment of stationary phase. These data suggest that regulation of rDNA transcription in vivo may involve modulation in availability of the activated polymerase I subform."
https://openalex.org/W2012750095,"Cultured cells from either chicken lens or liver plated on solid substrates form flat epithelial sheets with adherens-type junctions between them. In lens cells these junctions contain A-CAM, while the same type of intercellular junctions in liver cells contain another cell adhesion molecule, L-CAM. Coculturing of lens and liver cells in the same dish resulted in the formation of mixed (heterotypic) adherens junctions. Double immunofluorescent labeling for both A-CAM and L-CAM indicated that the mixed junctions contained both molecules, each of which was present on one of the two partner cells. Moreover, the formation of the heterotypic junctions could be effectively inhibited by both anti-A-CAM and anti-L-CAM antibodies. It has thus been proposed that A-CAM and L-CAM share significant functional homology and may be involved in heterophilic interactions leading to the establishment of molecularly and cellularly asymmetrical adherens-type junctions."

The noncancerous skin fibroblasts of family members exhibit a unique characteristic of being resistant to the killing effect of ionizing radiation. A three- to eightfold elevation in expression of c-myc and an apparent activation of c-raf-1 gene have been observed in these noncancerous skin fibroblasts. These results may provide insight into the heritable defect underlying the familial predisposition to a variety of cancers.

https://openalex.org/W1539563997,"Heparin with high anticoagulant activity was isolated from the two marine clam species Anomalocardia brasiliana and Tivela mactroides. A large portion of the polysaccharide chains of both preparations bound with high affinity to immobilized antithrombin. Titrations monitored by tryptophan fluorescence showed that clam polysaccharide chains with Mr approximately 22,500 contained up to three binding sites for antithrombin and that the binding constants for the interaction of these chains with antithrombin were higher than those reported for mammalian heparin of comparable size. Structural analysis of clam heparin fractions and subfractions of clam heparin with differing affinity for immobilized antithrombin revealed the presence of large amounts (up to 25-30% of the total disaccharide units) of the 3-O-sulfated saccharide sequences (-GlcNSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(3-OSO3)- and (-GlcNSO3)-GlcA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-, previously identified as unique markers for the antithrombin-binding region of heparin. The content of these saccharide sequences was found to increase with increasing affinity of the parent polysaccharide for antithrombin. Structural analysis of the clam heparins also demonstrated the occurrence of a novel saccharide sequence, tentatively identified as (-GlcNSO3)-IdA-GlcNSO3(3,6-di-OSO3)-, that has not previously been found in heparin or related polysaccharides. The contents of this latter sequence, at most 3-4% of the total disaccharide units, showed no correlation with the affinity for antithrombin."

https://openalex.org/W1528032238,"Abstract Porcine submaxillary gland mucin was deglycosylated with a mixture of pure glycosidases to give apomucin containing less than 1% carbohydrate. The resulting apomucin freed of glycosidases was found to contain nine amino acids: threonine, serine, glutamic acid, proline, glycine, alanine, valine, isoleucine, and arginine. Serine, threonine, glycine, and alanine comprise 77% of the composition. The molecular weight of apomucin was 96,500 as determined by gel filtration in guanidine hydrochloride. Its Stokes radius was greater than 68.6 A, a far larger value than expected for a globular protein with Mr = 96,500. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of apomucin suggests that it contains 42% aperiodic or other structure, 40% beta-turns, 10% antiparallel pleated sheet, and 8% helical structures. The predicted secondary structure of a 50-residue peptide from ovine submaxillary gland mucin resembles the circular dichroism predictions, being dominated by turns that would lead to an extended nonglobular structure. Analysis for the secondary structure of a 36-residue tryptic peptide derived from porcine submaxillary gland apomucin predicts a similar structure. It is concluded that apomucin is likely devoid of traditional secondary structure and serves as a scaffold upon which oligosaccharides are added in O-glycosidic linkage. When sufficient sialic acid is present in the oligosaccharides, native highly viscous mucin containing about two-thirds carbohydrate by weight is obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2014274009,"Chemical evidence is needed in both insect endocrinology and sensory physiology to understand hormone and pheromone action at the molecular level. Radiolabeled pheromones and hormones have been synthesized and used to identify binding and catabolic proteins from insect tissues. Chemically modified analogs, including photoaffinity labels and enzyme inhibitors, are among the tools used to covalently modify the specific acceptor or catalytic sites. Such targeted agents can also provide leads for the design of growth and mating disruptants by allowing manipulation of the physiologically important interactions of the chemical signals with macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1541401066,"Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) regulates the expression of a select few genes in quiescent BALB/c-3T3 cells. This was demonstrated by gel electrophoresis of radiolabeled proteins and by molecular cloning of twelve distinct IGF I-regulated cDNAs. Together, the electrophoretic and cloning data show that IGF I stimulates the expression of about 0.15% of the genes expressed by 3T3 cells, perhaps 30 genes in total. The genes encode both cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins. At the regulatory level the IGF I-controlled genes segregate into two categories. Category I genes (the minority) respond preferentially to IGF I. Their induction is prevented by actinomycin D, and they are superinduced by the combination of IGF I and anisomycin. Category II genes (the majority) respond to platelet-derived growth factor as well as to IGF I. The response of category II genes to IGF I is insensitive to actinomycin D. The data indicate that category II genes are constitutively transcribed and that IGF I regulates stability of the transcripts. The expression of category II genes correlates well with the ability of 3T3 cells to survive in serum-free culture medium."
https://openalex.org/W1944079823,"Using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (GLC/MS), we have confirmed the existence of several sialic acid modifications in the adult rat and human colon. The major O-acetylated sialic acid in both species is 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid; N-glycolylneuraminic acid is a major component of the adult rat colon. Both of these major modifications were found to be developmentally regulated during the perinatal period in the rat. The N-glycolyl modification is present prenatally and disappears rapidly in the postnatal period. It reappears in the preweanling period, reaching levels at weaning comparable to those found prenatally. In contrast, the 9-O-acetyl modification is very low prenatally, and undergoes a marked increase shortly after birth in both the rat and human colon. The difference in the kinetics of appearance of the two modifications suggests that they are independently regulated. Regulation of these modifications seems to be influenced by exposure to bacterial by-products or environmental stimuli. The N-glycolyl modification in the rat colon reappeared at weaning, a time of major change in enteral colonic substances. Spontaneously aborted human fetuses, including three with intrauterine infection at 27, 33, and 35 wk of gestation, showed adult levels of O-acetylation in colonic tissue. Also, although O-acetylation in freshly isolated colon tumor specimens was only somewhat lower than that in the adult normal colon, all established colon cancer cell lines studied showed minimal O-acetylation."
https://openalex.org/W1544708285,"Abstract The inhibition of thrombin by antithrombin III (AT III) and heparin has been studied in pure systems to determine the kinetics of inhibition during human prothrombin activation. The present study shows that prothrombinase-catalyzed prothrombin activation resulted in the generation of thrombin and meizothrombin(des F1). In the absence of heparin the second-order rate constants of the inactivation of both thrombin and meizothrombin(des F1) formed in the reaction mixture appeared to be identical, k = 3.7 X 10(5) M-1 min-1. The rate constant of inhibition of purified thrombin was 6.5 X 10(5) M-1 min-1. In the presence of heparin the decay of the amidolytic activity was biexponential and could be modeled by a four-parameter equation to determine the pseudo first-order rate constants of inhibition as well as the composition of the reaction with respect to the levels of thrombin and meizothrombin(des F1). The ratio of thrombin over meizothrombin(des F1) varied with the initial prothrombin concentration. Heparin catalyzed the AT III inhibition of thrombin but not meizothrombin(des F1) formed during the prothrombin activation. Thrombin, generated by (Xa-Va-phospholipid-Ca2+) was inhibited by AT III/heparin more slowly than purified thrombin, and the saturation kinetics of the inhibition with respect to AT III differed from those found with purified thrombin."
https://openalex.org/W2001536418,"Adenosine monophosphate is required for the activation of glycogen phosphorylase b and for release of the inhibition of phosphorylase a by glucose. Two molecules of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) bind to symmetry related sites at the subunit interface of the phosphorylase dimer. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds to the same site, but does not promote catalytic activity. The structure of glucose-inhibited phosphorylase a bound to AMP and also of the complex formed with glucose and ATP is described. Crystallographic refinement of these complexes reveals that structural changes are associated with AMP but not ATP binding. The origin of these effects can be traced to different effector binding modes exhibited by AMP and ATP, respectively. The conformational changes associated with AMP binding traverse multiple paths in the enzyme and link the effector and catalytic sites."
https://openalex.org/W92761622,"The 31P NMR pH indicator, methylphosphonate, has been extensively characterized, and the uncertainty in pH determination by its chemical shift has been analyzed. The pKa decreases by 0.003 pH unit/degrees C and 0.06 pH unit/100 mM ionic strength. The pKa appears not to be sensitive to Ca2+ but is sensitive to Mg2+, resulting in an uncertainty of +/- 0.05 pH unit. Substituting 300 mM Na+ for 300 mM K+ causes the pKa to decrease by 0.1 pH unit. Taking the effects of temperature, ionic strength, and cation identity into account, the overall estimated uncertainty in pH determination can be as high as +/- 0.1 pH unit. Methylphosphonate was tested as a pH indicator in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. Our data indicate that both the unchanged and monoanion forms of methyl phosphonate are very permeable, rendering this compound unsuitable as a pH indicator in this system. However, the sensitivity of this compound's chemical shift to pH and the relative insensitivity to other parameters suggest that phosphonates, as a group, may be applicable as pH indicators by 31P NMR."
https://openalex.org/W1518112685,"PUT cells were selected from the XD line of cultured tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv. Xanthi-nc) for the ability to utilize putrescine as sole nitrogen source. Previous work had indicated that hydroxycinnamoylputrescines (principally caffeoylputrescine) and 4-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA) are obligatory intermediates in the assimilation of putrescine by PUT cells. The apparent absence in these cells of diamine or polyamine oxidase and pyrroline dehydrogenase, enzymes which catalyze putrescine oxidation in some plant species, led us to propose the following pathway for putrescine oxidation in PUT cells: putrescine----hydroxycinnamoylputrescine----hydroxycinnamoyl - 4-aminobutyraldehyde----hydroxycinnamoyl-GABA----GABA. We tested the hypothesis by looking for the predicted compound, caffeoyl-GABA. A chemical synthesis was developed, and chromatographic and mass spectroscopic procedures were devised for identifying the compound in extracts of cells and plant tissues. Caffeoyl-GABA was found in extracts of PUT cells in micromolar concentrations but was not present in XD cells. Thus, its occurrence in PUT cells appears to be a direct result of selection for the ability to catabolize putrescine. Caffeoyl-GABA has the same distribution in tobacco plants as caffeoylputrescine, i.e. flower buds greater than open flowers greater than floral leaves, green fruit; absent in vegetative tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1508671389,"Two high precision techniques, titration microcalorimetry and thin-layer optical binding measurements, have made possible the evaluation of enthalpy changes for the overall oxygenation reactions for human hemoglobin (HbAo). Although the heat of adding three oxygen molecules could not be evaluated due to the indeterminate contribution of this species to the oxygen binding curve of the protein (Gill, S. J., Di Cera, E., Doyle, M. L., Bishop, G. A., and Robert, C. H. (1987) Biochemistry, 26, 3995-4002), the heats for binding two and four oxygen molecules were found to be simple multiples of the first binding heat. A direct consequence of equal stepwise heats is invariance of the shape of the binding curve with temperature, as pointed out by Wyman (Wyman, J. (1939) J. Biol. Chem. 127, 581-599). Titration microcalorimetry was also performed for the binding of carbon monoxide to hemoglobin. While the tight binding of CO precludes high-precision binding measurements, it does allow one to accurately determine the heat of ligation as a function of the CO bound. In these titrations a uniform heat of reaction is not observed, but the heat of binding increases markedly near the end point. This implies that the stepwise binding enthalpy for adding the third CO molecule is anomalously endothermic and for adding the fourth strongly exothermic. A similar phenomenon cannot be ruled out in the case of oxygen because of imprecision intrinsic in the analysis of the weaker ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W1545491241,"5-Oxoprolinase catalyzes a reaction in which the cleavage of ATP to ADP and Pi and the decyclization of 5-oxoproline to form glutamate are coupled. When the reaction catalyzed by 5-oxoprolinase of Pseudomonas putida was carried out to 90% completion in H2(18)O, the residual 5-oxoproline was found to contain 18O in the amide carbonyl oxygen atom. Such isotopic incorporation was not observed in similar studies with a subunit of the enzyme which catalyzes 5-oxoproline-dependent ATPase and formation of a phosphorylated 5-oxoproline intermediate (Seddon, A.P., and Meister, A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 11538-11543). When the complete reaction was carried out in H2(18)O, the products glutamate (gamma-carboxyl) and inorganic phosphate were mono- and di-labeled with 18O. Studies with 5-[18O]oxo-L-proline confirmed such replacement of the oxygen atoms of the gamma-carboxyl group of glutamate and the carbonyl oxygen of 5-oxoproline. Oxygen was not transferred from 5-oxoproline to inorganic phosphate. Studies with analogs of 5-oxoproline showed that di-labeling of inorganic phosphate occurred only when ATP hydrolysis was coupled or partially coupled with the decyclization of the substrate. Studies with 5-oxoprolinase from rat kidney gave similar results. These observations are in accord with the view that the reaction involves enzyme-bound phosphorylated intermediates and provide evidence for a phosphorylated tetrahedral intermediate, whose formation is required for coupling."
https://openalex.org/W1597539653,"The steady-state kinetic mechanism for the reaction of n-alkylamines and phenazine ethosulfate (PES) or phenazine methosulfate (PMS) with methylamine dehydrogenase from bacterium W3A1 is found to be of the ping-pong type. This conclusion is based on the observations that 1/v versus 1/[methylamine] or 1/[butylamine] plots, at various constant concentrations of an oxidizing substrate, and 1/v versus 1/[PES] or 1/[PMS] plots, at various constant concentrations of a reducing substrate, are parallel. Additionally, the values of kcat/Km for four n-alkylamines are identical when PES is the oxidizing substrate, as were the kcat/Km values for four reoxidizing substrates when methylamine was the reducing substrate. Last, analysis of steady-state kinetic data obtained when methylamine and propylamine are presented to the enzyme simultaneously and PES and PMS are used simultaneously also supports the involvement of a ping-pong mechanism. The enzymic reaction with either methylamine or PES is dependent on the ionic strength, and the data indicate that each interacts with an anionic site on methylamine dehydrogenase. The presence of ammonium ion at low concentration activates the enzyme, but at high concentration this ion is a competitive inhibitor in the reaction involving methylamine and the enzyme. A complete steady-state mechanism describing these ammonia effects is presented and is discussed in light of the nature of the pyrroloquinoline quinone cofactor covalently bound to the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W324421699,"The energy metabolism of an anaerobic obligate thermophile, Clostridium thermocellum, has been examined as a function of incubation temperature using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Specifically investigated were the generation and availability of ATP as a function of temperature, activation energies for key processes in energy metabolism including formation of a pH gradient across the cell membrane, transport of key nutrients, and initial steps in glycolysis, and the existence of a membrane phase transition in the intact organism. Cells generate ATP via glycolysis at all temperatures examined; hence, limitation of the energy supply is not directly responsible for the lack of growth of this organism at low temperatures. Estimations of activation energies show a distinct hierarchy in the ATP-utilizing reactions examined. Conservation of ATP hydrolysis energy as delta pH has the lowest activation energy (less than or equal to 4 kcal/mol), two transport processes exhibit 10 kcal/mol activation energies, and early phosphorylation steps in glycolysis have significantly higher activation energies (approximately 25 kcal/mol). Neither the membrane-bound ATPase responsible for formation of the pH gradient nor the permease involved in phosphate transport shows evidence of a change in behavior around the phase transition temperature determined for extracted lipids of C. thermocellum. Line widths of inorganic phosphate do show a break in behavior around 35-40 degrees C. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed."
