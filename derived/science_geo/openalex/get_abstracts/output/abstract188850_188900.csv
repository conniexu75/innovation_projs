https://openalex.org/W2075401851,"Although microscopic laws of physics are invariant under the reversal of the arrow of time, the transport of energy and information in most devices is an irreversible process. It is this irreversibility that leads to intrinsic dissipations in electronic devices and limits the possibility of quantum computation. We theoretically predict that the electric field can induce a substantial amount of dissipationless quantum spin current at room temperature, in hole-doped semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs. On the basis of a generalization of the quantum Hall effect, the predicted effect leads to efficient spin injection without the need for metallic ferromagnets. Principles found here could enable quantum spintronic devices with integrated information processing and storage units, operating with low power consumption and performing reversible quantum computation."

https://openalex.org/W2091458978,"Hybridization is frequent in many organismal groups, but its role in adaptation is poorly understood. In sunflowers, species found in the most extreme habitats are ancient hybrids, and new gene combinations generated by hybridization are speculated to have contributed to ecological divergence. This possibility was tested through phenotypic and genomic comparisons of ancient and synthetic hybrids. Most trait differences in ancient hybrids could be recreated by complementary gene action in synthetic hybrids and were favored by selection. The same combinations of parental chromosomal segments required to generate extreme phenotypes in synthetic hybrids also occurred in ancient hybrids. Thus, hybridization facilitated ecological divergence in sunflowers."

https://openalex.org/W2002104055,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive, lethal neuromuscular disease that is associated with the degeneration of spinal and brainstem motor neurons, leading to atrophy of limb, axial, and respiratory muscles. The cause of ALS is unknown, and there is no effective therapy. Neurotrophic factors are candidates for therapeutic evaluation in ALS. Although chronic delivery of molecules to the central nervous system has proven difficult, we recently discovered that adeno-associated virus can be retrogradely transported efficiently from muscle to motor neurons of the spinal cord. We report that insulin-like growth factor 1 prolongs life and delays disease progression, even when delivered at the time of overt disease symptoms."
https://openalex.org/W1997679949,"The amygdalohippocampal circuit plays a pivotal role in Pavlovian fear memory. We simultaneously recorded electrical activity in the lateral amygdala (LA) and the CA1 area of the hippocampus in freely behaving fear-conditioned mice. Patterns of activity were related to fear behavior evoked by conditioned and indifferent sensory stimuli and contexts. Rhythmically synchronized activity at theta frequencies increased between the LA and the CA1 after fear conditioning and became significant during confrontation with conditioned fear stimuli and expression of freezing behavior. Synchronization of theta activities in the amygdalohippocampal network represents a neuronal correlate of conditioned fear, apt to improve neuronal communication during memory retrieval."

https://openalex.org/W2091127227,Age-related hearing loss (AHL) in common inbred mouse strains is a genetically complex quantitative trait. We found a synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism in exon 7 of Cdh23 that shows significant association with AHL and the deafness modifier mdfw (modifer of deafwaddler). The hypomorphic Cdh23(753A) allele causes in-frame skipping of exon 7. Altered adhesion or reduced stability of CDH23 may confer susceptibility to AHL. Homozygosity at Cdh23(753A) or in combination with heterogeneous secondary factors is a primary determinant of AHL in mice.

https://openalex.org/W2012543502,"During early development in vertebrates, Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is produced by the notochord and the floor plate. A ventrodorsal gradient of Shh directs ventrodorsal patterning of the neural tube. However, Shh is also required for the survival of neuroepithelial cells. We show that Patched (Ptc) induces apoptotic cell death unless its ligand Shh is present to block the signal. Moreover, the blockade of Ptc-induced cell death partly rescues the chick spinal cord defect provoked by Shh deprivation. Thus, the proapoptotic activity of unbound Ptc and the positive effect of Shh-bound Ptc on cell differentiation probably cooperate to achieve the appropriate spinal cord development."

Lateral gene transfer is considered the primary explanation for discordance among gene phylogenies and as an obstacle to reconstructing the tree of life. We measured the extent of phylogenetic conflict and alien-gene acquisition within quartets of sequenced genomes. Although comparisons of complete gene inventories indicate appreciable gain and loss of genes, orthologs available for phylogenetic reconstruction are consistent with a single tree."
https://openalex.org/W2044321635,"Amyloid fibrils are components of proteinaceous plaques that are associated with conformational diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, and familial amyloidosis. Amyloid polypeptides share a specific quarternary element known as structure. Commonly, fibrillar aggregates are modified by advanced glycation end products (AGE). In addition, AGE formation itself induces protein aggregation. Both amyloid proteins and protein-AGE adducts bind multiligand receptors, such as receptor for AGE, CD36, and scavenger receptors A and B type I, and the serine protease tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that glycation induces refolding of globular proteins, accompanied by formation of structure. Using transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate here that glycated albumin condensates into fibrous or amorphous aggregates. These aggregates bind to amyloid-specific dyes Congo red and thioflavin T and to tPA. In contrast to globular albumin, glycated albumin contains amino acid residues in β-sheet conformation, as measured with circular dichroism spectropolarimetry. Moreover, it displays structure, as determined with x-ray fiber diffraction. We conclude that glycation induces refolding of initially globular albumin into amyloid fibrils comprising structure. This would explain how glycated ligands and amyloid ligands can bind to the same multiligand cross-β structure receptors and to tPA."
https://openalex.org/W2031171284,"Angiopoietin-like 3 (ANGPTL3) is a secreted protein that is mainly expressed in the liver and regulates lipid metabolism by inhibiting the lipolysis of triglyceriderich lipoproteins. Using deletion mutants of human ANGPTL3, we demonstrated that the N-terminal coiled-coil domain-containing fragment-(17–207) and not the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain-containing fragment-(207–460) increased the plasma triglyceride levels in mice. We also found that the N-terminal region 17–165 was required to increase plasma triglyceride levels in mice and that a substitution of basic amino acid residues in the region 61–66 of the fragment showed no increase in the plasma triglyceride levels and no inhibition of lipolysis by lipoprotein lipase. In addition, when we analyzed ANGPTL3 in human plasma, we detected cleaved fragments of ANGPTL3. By analyzing recombinant ANGPTL3 in mouse plasma, we found that it was cleaved at two sites, Arg221↓Ala222 and Arg224↓Thr225, which are located in the linker region between the coiled-coil domain and the fibrinogen-like domain. Furthermore, a cleavage-resistant mutant of ANGPTL3 was determined to be less active than wild-type ANGPTL3 in increasing mouse plasma triglyceride levels but not in inhibiting lipoprotein lipase activity. These findings suggest that the cleavage of ANGPTL3 is important for the activation of ANGPTL3 in vivo.

ANGPTL3 is structurally similar to angiopoietins (2Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J.

It also has a signal peptide for secretion, a helical domain predicted to form coiled-coils (CCD), and a C-terminal globular fibrinogen-like domain (FLD). Angiopoietins are ligands that bind to the receptor tyrosine kinase Tie2. The FLDs of angiopoietins bind to Tie2, and the CCDs of angiopoietins mediate ligand homo-oligomerization (5Procopio W.N. Pelavin P.I. Lee W.M.F. Yeilding N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30196-30201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although ANGPTL3 does not bind to Tie2, it may also induce angiogenesis by binding to integrin αVβ3 (6Camenisch G. Pisabarro M.T. Sherman D. Kowalski J. Nagel M. Hass P. Gurney A. Bodary S.C.

We reported that KK/Snk mice (previously, KK/San) had abnormally low plasma lipid levels and identified a mutation in the Angptl3 gene as the cause of the hypolipidemic phenotype of KK/Snk mice (7Shiraki T. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Diabetes Frontier. 1993; 4: 641Google Scholar, 8Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Hidehiko F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Injection of recombinant ANGPTL3 or adenoviruses encoding ANGPTL3 resulted in an increase of plasma lipid levels in mice. It has been speculated that ANGPTL3 was capable of inhibiting lipolysis of triglycerides, because an injection of recombinant ANGPTL3 induced a rapid increase in mouse plasma triglyceride levels (9Rossetti L. Goldberg I.J. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 112-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 10Naoumova R.P. Betteridge D.J. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2215-2216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We further reported that very low density lipoprotein clearance was enhanced in KK/Snk mice and that recombinant ANGPTL3 directly inhibited lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity in vitro (11Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yoshida K. Ando Y. Koishi R. Ueda K. Inaba T. Minekura H. Kohama T. Furukawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33742-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ANGPTL3 could be involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting LPL activity. Thus, ANGPTL3 seems to be a multifunctional factor that may regulate both lipid metabolism and angiogenesis. The C-terminal FLD of ANGPTL3 was reported to be involved in angiogenesis via binding to integrin αVβ3 (6Camenisch G. Pisabarro M.T. Sherman D. Kowalski J. Nagel M. Hass P. Gurney A. Bodary S.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 17281-17290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but the domain of ANGPTL3 that is involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism has not been elucidated. In this study, we constructed various mutants of ANGPTL3 and analyzed the region of ANGPTL3 required for its function in lipid metabolism. Further, as it was revealed that ANGPTL3 was cleaved in the linker region between CCD and FLD, we estimated the importance of this cleavage to the activity of ANGPTL3 in vivo. Construction of Mutants—We inserted each mutant DNA into a mammalian expression vector (pME18S) as described below. Full-length ANGPTL3 cDNA was cloned previously (8Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Hidehiko F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the sense primer, 5′-TTGAATTCGGCTTGCCACCATGGTCACAATTAAGCTCCTTCTTTTTATTG-3′ (includes an EcoRI site and a Kozak consensus sequence, underlined), and the antisense primer, 5′-TCTAGAGCCTCGTTCATTCAAAGCTTTCTGAATCTG-3′ (includes an XbaI site, underlined), digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and cloned into the corresponding sites of pME18S to form pME/ANGPTL3. Two synthesized oligonucleotides, 5′-GATCAGCATCATCACCATCACCAT-3′ and 5′-GATCCTGGTGATGGTGATGATGCG-3′, were annealed to each other and cloned into the BclI site of pME/ANGPTL3, which is located near the end of the signal peptide-coding region, to form pME/His/ANGPTL3. Plasmid pME/ANGPTL3-(207–460) was generated from pME/ANGPTL3 by digestion with BclI/SpeI, purification of a 3.8-kbp fragment, filling in of the 5′ overhang with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligation. Plasmid pME/ANGPTL3-(17–207) was generated from pME/His/ANGPTL3 by digestion with SpeI, filling in of the 5′ overhang with T4 DNA polymerase, and self-ligation. Plasmid pME/ANGPTL3-(79–207) was generated from pME/ANGPTL3-(17–207) by digestion with BclI, purification of a 4.2-kbp fragment, and self-ligation. Plasmid pME/ANGPTL3-(17–165) was generated from pME/His/ANGPTL3 by replacing the EcoRI/SpeI fragment with an EcoRI/SpeI fragment that was generated by PCR using the sense primer 5′-TAAAAGCTGCGGAATTCGGCTTGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-ACACTAGTTTTTAAGTGAAGTTACTTCTGG-3′. Plasmid pME/ANGPTL3-[17–207mu] was generated from pME/ANGPTL3-(17–207). Substitutions of H62I, K63N, and K65N were carried out by site-directed mutagenesis using the Mutan-Super Express Km kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) and a synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-GTCATAAACACGAACGGCCAAATTAATGAC-3′. Plasmid pME/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] was generated from pME/His/ANGPTL3. To perform the substitutions of R204T and R205T, the EcoRI/SpeI fragment was replaced with the EcoRI/SpeI fragment produced by PCR using the sense primer 5′-TAAAAGCTGCGGAATTCGGCTTGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-GTTCTTGAATACTAGTCGTTGTGAGCTG-3′. Substitutions of R221S and R224S were performed by site-directed mutagenesis using a synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-CAAGCCAACTGCACCAAGTACTACTCCC-3′. A substitution of R235S was conducted by site-directed mutagenesis using a synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-GAATGAAATAAGTAATGTAAAACATG-3′. We verified the nucleotide sequences of all mutants generated by PCR or site-directed mutagenesis. Construction of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses were generated as previously described (12Miyake S. Makimura M. Kanegae Y. Harada S. Sato Y. Takamori K. Tokuda C. Saito I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) using an adenovirus expression vector kit (Takara Shuzo). EcoRI/XbaI fragments of recombinant pME18Ss generated above were blunt-ended and inserted into the SwaI site of a cosmid vector pAxCAwt. Co-transfection of these constructs and adenoviral DNA generated recombinant adenoviruses. Recombinant genes were under the control of a CAG promoter. Recombinant adenoviruses encoding His/ANGPTL3, ANGPTL3-(17–165), ANGPTL3-(17–207), ANGPTL3-(79–207), ANGPTL3-(207–460), ANGPTL3-[17–207mu], and ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] were designated as Ad/His/ANGPTL3, Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–165), Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207), Ad/ANGPTL3-(79–207), Ad/ANGPTL3-(207–460), Ad/ANGPTL3-[17–207mu], and Ad/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu], respectively. Recombinant adenoviruses were cultured and purified as described previously (13Kanegae Y. Makimura M. Saito I. Jpn. J. Med. Sci. Biol. 1994; 47: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). We confirmed the presence of the secreted proteins in the culture supernatant of all recombinant adenovirus-infected HeLa cells as follows. We infected 5 × 107 pfu of recombinant adenovirus on a 25-cm2 sheet of confluent HeLa cells. At 3 days after infection, we collected the supernatant of the cells. After adding trichloroacetic acid of 1/10 the volume, proteins were obtained from the supernatant by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ANGPTL3 polyclonal antibody as a probe. Animal Assay—KK/Snk mice were established as previously described (7Shiraki T. Yoshioka S. Horikoshi H. Diabetes Frontier. 1993; 4: 641Google Scholar, 8Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Hidehiko F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We injected a recombinant adenovirus intravenously to KK/Snk mice via the tail vein. We obtained blood from the retro-orbital plexus at several time points after injection. We measured the plasma triglyceride concentration with a commercial kit (WAKO Pure Chemical Co., Osaka, Japan). Protein Preparation—We transfected mammalian gene expression constructs into COS-1 cells using reagent LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). At 3–4 days after transfection, we collected the supernatants of the transfected cells and purified the recombinant proteins using the His Trap kit (Amersham Biosciences). The purified recombinant proteins were further dialyzed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (Sigma). Thereafter, the inhibitory activity on lipolysis was assessed by an LPL assay. LPL Assay—The LPL activity assays were conducted using rat LPL obtained from rat preadipocytes as described previously (11Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yoshida K. Ando Y. Koishi R. Ueda K. Inaba T. Minekura H. Kohama T. Furukawa H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33742-33748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Detection of Human Plasma ANGPTL3—We prepared a mouse monoclonal antibody and a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognized the recombinant ANGPTL3 prepared as described previously (8Koishi R. Ando Y. Ono M. Shimamura M. Yasumo H. Fujiwara T. Horikoshi H. Hidehiko F. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 151-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibody used in this study was confirmed to recognize the N-terminal portion 17–207 of ANGPTL3. We purified human plasma (Sigma) by affinity chromatography that was prepared by immobilizing the anti-ANTPTL3 monoclonal antibody to an N-hydroxy-succinimide-activated HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences) at a concentration of 5 mg/ml packed gel. We eluted the proteins that bound to the column with 0.5 m NaCl and 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.7) and immediately neutralized them with 1/10 volume of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The purified proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-ANGPTL3 polyclonal antibody as a probe. Characterization of the Cleavage Site of ANGPTL3—KK/Snk mice were intravenously injected with 2 × 109 pfu of the recombinant adenovirus, Ad/His/ANGPTL3. We collected the plasma from the recombinant adenovirus-injected KK/Snk mice at 2 days after injection and then purified the proteins that contained a hexahistidine tag from the plasma using the His Trap kit (Amersham Biosciences). The purified proteins were deoxidized in 10 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma) and alkylated in 55 mm iodoacetamide (Wako Pure Chemical Co.). The deoxidized and alkylated proteins were digested with lysyl endopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Co.) or deglycosylated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) followed by digestion with sequencing grade endoproteinase Glu-C (Promega, Madison, WI). Then, formic acid was added to the peptides (final concentration 0.05%), and the digested proteins were analyzed by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry: column, original fused silica electrospray needle packed with Inertsil ODS-2 (GL Science, Tokyo, Japan); solvent delivery, CapLC System (Waters, Milford, MA); solvent A, 0.05% formic acid/H2O; solvent B, 0.05% formic acid/acetonitrile; linear gradient elution, 0–30% solvent B over 1 h; mass spectrometer, Q-Tof2 (Micromass, Manchester, UK) with an electrospray ion source. The resulting spectra were processed with ProteinLynx (Micromass, Manchester, UK) software. N-terminal Fragment of ANGPTL3 Increases Plasma Triglyceride Levels in Mice: Determination of the Region Essential for Activity—To determine the region of ANGPTL3 involved in lipid metabolism, we first tested whether the N-terminal CCD-containing region or the C-terminal FLD-containing region, alone, could increase plasma triglyceride levels in mice. We constructed deletion mutants of ANGPTL3, ANGPTL3-(17–207) and ANGPTL3-(207–460) (Fig. 1A) and generated recombinant adenoviruses, Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207) and Ad/ANGPTL3-(207–460). After confirming that recombinant proteins were released in the supernatant of the adenovirus-infected Hela cells (Fig. 1B), the adenoviruses were injected into KK/Snk mice. The recombinant proteins were also detected in the plasma of mice injected with Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207) and Ad/ANGPTL3-(207–460) (Fig. 1C). The plasma triglyceride levels of Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207)-injected mice were dramatically increased, whereas those of Ad/ANGPTL3-(207–460)-injected mice were not (Fig. 1D). To narrow down the essential region of the functional domain of ANGPTL3, we generated recombinant adenoviruses, Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–165) and Ad/ANGPTL3-(79–207) and injected them into KK/Snk mice. Injection of Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–165) resulted in an increase in plasma triglyceride levels, whereas injection of Ad/ANGPTL3-(79–207) did not (Fig. 1E). Although the amount of recombinant proteins secreted from Ad/ANGPTL3-(79–207)-infected HeLa cells was greater than that from Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–165)-infected HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), we could not detect any recombinant proteins in the plasma of mice injected with Ad/ANGPTL3-(79–207) (Fig. 1C, lane 4). These data show that the region 17–165 elicits activity and suggest that the region 17–78 could be essential for protein stability in vivo. To evaluate whether a shorter fragment consisting of the first 78 N-terminal amino acid residues and not including the coiled-coil domain was active or not, we constructed an expression vector that encoded 1–78 of ANGPTL3 and transfected it into COS-1 cells. However, we could not detect any recombinant protein in the supernatant of the COS-1 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we could not elucidate whether region 17–78 was sufficient for the activity or not. On the other hand, we found that there was a putative heparin-binding motif (14Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), 61VHKTKG66, in the region 17–78. To analyze the importance of this motif, we constructed a mutant in which basic amino residues of the motif VHKTKG were substituted with VINTNG (ANGPTL3-[17–207mu]) (Fig. 2A) and generated an adenovirus Ad/ANGPTL3-[17–207mu]. Injection of Ad/ANGPTL3-[17–207mu] into KK/Snk mice did not increase plasma triglyceride levels (Fig. 2B) even though recombinant proteins were detected in the plasma of Ad/ANGPTL3-[17–207mu]-infected mice as much as in the plasma of Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207)-injected mice (Fig. 2C), where plasma triglyceride levels were dramatically increased (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Importance of a putative heparin-binding motif for the activity.

As shown in Fig. 2D, recombinant ANGPTL3-(17–207) inhibited the lipolysis of triglycerides by LPL. ANGPTL3-[17–207mu] also inhibited lipolysis but only at high concentrations. The inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3-[17–207mu] on LPL in vitro was much lower than that of ANGPTL3-(17–207). ANGPTL3 Is Cleaved in Vivo in Human and Mouse—As mentioned above, it was shown that the N-terminal region of ANGPTL3 was involved in lipid metabolism, whereas the C-terminal region of ANGPTL3 was involved in angiogenesis. We could not detect any ANGPTL3 protein in human plasma by Western blotting using either anti-ANGPTL3 polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies (data not shown). To detect ANGPTL3 protein in human plasma and determine whether ANGPTL3 can be processed into smaller fragments, we purified ANGPTL3 from human plasma by affinity chromatography using anti-ANGPTL3 monoclonal antibody that recognizes the N-terminal 17–207 of ANGPTL3. Purified ANGPTL3 was visualized by Western blotting using anti-ANGPTL3 polyclonal antibody. We detected cleaved ANGPTL3 as well as full-length ANGPTL3 (Fig. 3A). In addition, we detected cleaved proteins, whose molecular masses were ∼30–35 kDa, as well as full-length proteins in the plasma of Ad/His/ANGPTL3-injected mice (Fig. 3B). Then, we purified the N-terminal fragment of ANGPTL3 from the plasma of Ad/His/ANGPTL3-injected mice by nickel affinity chromatography. We digested the purified protein sample with lysyl endopeptidase or endoproteinase Glu-C and analyzed the digested fragments by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. As a result, we detected peptides 198EIENQLRRTSIQEPTEISLSSKPR221 and 198EIENQLRRTSIQEPTEISLSSKPRAPR224 in the sample digested with lysyl endopeptidase, and peptides 214ISLSSKPR221 and 214ISLSSKPRAPR224 in the sample digested with endoproteinase Glu-C. Thus, it was found that ANGPTL3 was cleaved at two sites, Arg221↓Ala222 and Arg224↓Thr225, in the linker region between CCD and FLD (Fig. 3C). Cleavage of ANGPTL3 Is Important for Its Activation in Vivo—We showed that ANGPTL3 was cleaved in mice and that the N-terminal fragment of ANGPTL3 increased plasma triglyceride levels. Although full-length ANGPTL3 inhibited lipolysis of triglycerides by LPL in vitro to the same extent as the N-terminal fragment of ANGPTL3, we considered that cleavage of ANGPTL3 could be required to increase plasma triglyceride levels. To evaluate the effect of the cleavage, we generated a recombinant adenovirus (Ad/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu]) that encoded a mutant ANGPTL3 in which all five arginine residues located in and near the linker region between the CCD and the FLD were substituted with other amino acids (R203T, R204T, R221S, R224S, and R235S) (Fig. 4A). We injected Ad/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] into KK/Snk mice. We confirmed that cleaved recombinant proteins were not detected in the plasma of Ad/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu]-injected mice (Fig. 4B). This result suggests that the substitution of these amino acids alters the susceptibility to cleavage in vivo. At 1 day after injection of the recombinant adenovirus, the plasma triglyceride concentration in Ad/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu]-injected mice was 186.4 ± 11.2 mg/deciliter (n = 3), whereas that of Ad/His/ANGPTL3- and Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207)-injected mice was dramatically increased and reached 1243 ± 184 and 2564 ± 67 mg/deciliter, respectively (Fig. 4C). Recombinant proteins were detected in the plasma of Ad/His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu]-injected mice as much as in the plasma of Ad/His/ANGPTL3- and Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207)-injected mice (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] is less active than His/ANGPTL3 in mice. Next, we prepared recombinant His/ANGPTL3 and His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] and confirmed that recombinant His/ANGPTL3-[5Rmu] inhibited lipolysis of triglycerides by acting on LPL as potently as recombinant His/ANGPTL3 (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that the substitution of the five amino acids did not result in the loss of lipolysis inhibition in vitro and that cleavage of ANGPTL3 is an important process for the activation of ANGPTL3 in vivo. ANGPTL3 consists of the N-terminal CCD, C-terminal FLD, and a linker region. We have shown that ANGPTL3 is cleaved in the linker region between CCD and FLD in vivo and that the cleaved N-terminal portion of ANGPTL3 inhibits LPL activity and increases the level of circulating plasma triglycerides in mice. Furthermore, a cleavage-resistant mutant of ANGPTL3 was found to be less active than the cleavable wild-type ANGPTL3 in increasing mouse plasma triglyceride levels, which suggests that cleavage of ANGPTL3 is an important process for the activation of ANGPTL3 in vivo. We have also shown that the putative heparin-binding motif located at 61–66 is important for the activity. We showed that the N-terminal 17–207 of ANGPTL3 has the ability to regulate lipid metabolism. It was reported that the C-terminal portion of ANGPTL3 had the ability to induce angiogenesis (6Camenisch G. Pisabarro M.T. Sherman D. Kowalski J. Nagel M. Hass P. Gurney A. Bodary S.C. Liang X.H. Clark K.R. Beresini M.H. Ferrara N. Gerber H.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17281-17290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Therefore, the regions of ANGPTL3 involved in angiogenesis and lipid metabolism were determined to be different from each other. Furthermore, we were able to narrow the region involved in lipid metabolism down to the region 17–165. The plasma triglyceride levels of mice injected with Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–165) (1304 ± 262 mg/deciliter at 1 day postinjection) were lower than those injected with Ad/ANGPTL3-(17–207) (5056 ± 93 mg/deciliter at 1 day postinjection) (Fig. 1, D and E). However, these plasma triglyceride levels seemed to be correlated with the plasma levels of recombinant protein (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the region 17–165 could increase the plasma triglyceride levels as well as the region 17–207. We also showed that a substitution of basic amino residues in the putative heparin-binding motif located at 61–66 of the N-terminal resulted in a dramatic decrease in its inhibitory activity on LPL in vitro. Although it was reported that heparin modulated LPL activity in vitro (15Lithell H. Boberg J. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1977; 37: 551-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), only adding heparin did not affect the inhibitory effect of ANGPTL3 on LPL activity (data not shown). We reported that ANGPTL4 could also inhibit LPL activity (16Yoshida K. Shimizugawa T. Ono M. Furukawa H. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1770-1772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), but we could not find a putative heparin-binding motif in the active region of ANGPTL4. These findings suggest that a region containing the putative heparinbinding motif may interact with a factor involved in lipolysis other than heparin, and the binding of this factor to the putative heparin-binding motif may be important for the activity. To elucidate how ANGPTL3 inhibits the lipolysis of triglyceride, it must be determined whether ANGPTL3 directly inhibits LPL or whether another factor is involved. A putative heparin-binding motif-substituted mutant protein would be useful as a negative control in further studies. With regard to the cleaved N-terminal fragment, we detected cleaved ANGPTL3 in human and ANGPTL3-overexpressed mice. Although we did not use any protein inhibitors when collecting plasma, we did confirm that the recombinant full-length ANGPTL3 protein was not cleaved during incubation with mouse plasma at 37 °C for an hour. We also considered that the cleavage of ANGPTL3 that we observed did not occur after we collected the plasma. We determined that the main cleavage sites were at Arg221↓Ala222 and Arg224↓Thr225, but other small bands of cleaved proteins were also detected (Fig. 3B), suggesting that ANGPTL3 may have been cleaved at other sites albeit only a little. To examine this further, we substituted five arginine residues located in and near the linker region between CCD and FLD. We confirmed that the substitutions of the five amino acid residues altered the susceptibility to the cleavage in vivo (Fig. 4B) and that the substitution of these amino acids did not alter the LPL inhibitory activity of these recombinant proteins in vitro (Fig. 4D). We demonstrated that the increase of plasma triglyceride levels in the cleavage-resistant mutant ANGPTL3-overexpressed mice was far less than that in the wild-type ANGPTL3-overexpressed mice (Fig. 4C), even though the amounts of recombinant protein detected in the plasma of the cleavage-resistant mutant ANGPTL3-overexpressed mice were greater than those of the wild-type ANGPTL3-overexpressed mice (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that non-cleavable, full-length ANGPTL3 is less active in increasing triglyceride levels in vivo despite its high LPL inhibitory activity in vitro. There could be two explanations behind this inconsistency between the in vitro and in vivo activities of full-length ANGPTL3. One is the possibility that ANGPTL3 inhibition of LPL is not the cause of the increase in triglyceride levels in vivo but that the increase in triglyceride levels is due to ANGPTL3 affecting hepatic lipase. The other is the possibility that full-length ANGPTL3 is not able to inhibit LPL in vivo unless it is cleaved. With regard to the first hypothesis, we had found that the inhibition of hepatic lipase by ANGPTL3-(17–207) was very weak compared with that of LPL (data not shown). Moreover, when the N-terminal fragments of ANGPTL3 (ANGPTL3-(17–207)) and its mutant (ANGPTL3-[17–207mu]) were tested, the inhibitory activity on LPL in vitro corresponded well to the triglyceride-increasing activity in vivo. Therefore, we considered that the triglyceride increase was because of the inhibition of LPL by ANGPTL3. With regard to the second hypothesis, it is known that some growth factors and cytokines are associated with other proteins that can suppress their actions and that in order to activate these factors and cytokines, they must first be liberated from these proteins by proteolytic processing (17Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 18Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 19Fowlkes J.L. Winkler M.K. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2002; 13: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Natural full-length ANGPTL3 may also be in complex with a protein, and this protein may be bound to the active site of ANGPTL3. It could be considered that the cleavage of ANGPTL3 dislodges the protein and releases the active ANGPTL3 fragment. We previously found that ANGPTL3 was able to bind to adipocytes and heparin was partially able to inhibit this binding (20Shimamura M. Matsuda M. Kobayashi S. Ando Y. Ono M. Koishi R. Furukawa H. Makishima M. Shimomura I. Biochem. Biophys Res. Comm. 2003; 301: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ANGPTL3 may bind to proteoglycans. Therefore, proteoglycans could be the proteins binding to ANGPTL3 and suppressing its activity. ANGPTL3 is mainly expressed in the liver (1Conklin D. Gilbertson D. Taft D.W. Maurer M.F. Whitmore T.E. Smith D.L. Walker K.M. Chen L.H. Wattler S. Nehls M. Lewis K.B. Genomics. 1999; 62: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In plasma, full-length ANGPTL3 was also detected (Fig. 3, A and B). These findings let us speculate that after being secreted from the liver, ANGPTL3 circulates in the blood in the full-length form and carries out its role in lipogenesis at the target site upon its cleavage.

Notch is modified in its epidermal growth factor-like domains by the addition of fucose to serine or threonine residues. O-Fucosylation is mediated by protein O-fucosyltransferase 1, and down-regulation of this enzyme by RNA interference or mutation of the Ofut1 gene in Drosophila or by mutation of the Pofut1 gene in mouse prevents Notch signaling. To investigate the molecular basis for the requirement for O-linked fucose on Notch, we assayed the ability of tagged, soluble forms of the Notch extracellular domain to bind to its ligands, Delta and Serrate. Down-regulation of OFUT1 by RNA interference in Notch-secreting cells inhibits both Delta-Notch and Serrate-Notch binding, demonstrating a requirement for O-linked fucose for efficient binding of Notch to its ligands. Conversely, overexpression of OFUT1 in cultured cells increases Serrate-Notch binding but inhibits Delta-Notch binding. These effects of OFUT1 are consistent with the consequences of OFUT1 overexpression on Notch signaling in vivo. Intriguingly, they are also opposite to, and are suppressed by, expression of the glycosyltransferase Fringe, which specifically modifies O-linked fucose. Thus, Notch-ligand interactions are dependent upon both the presence and the type of O-fucose glycans. Notch receptors are glycoproteins that mediate a wide range of developmental processes.

Thus, Notch-ligand interactions are dependent upon both the presence and the type of O-fucose glycans. Notch receptors are transmembrane proteins that regulate a wide range of cell fate decisions throughout the Metazoa (for review, see Ref. 1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). The broad range of processes that require normal Notch signaling is reflected in the range of human diseases that result from mutations in components of the Notch signaling pathway. These include leukemia, Alagille syndrome, CADASIL, and spondylocostal dystoses (for review, see Refs. 2Joutel A. Tournier-Lasserve E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar and 3Gridley T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 9-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notch receptors are activated by two types of ligands, Serrate ligands and Delta ligands. The core components of the Notch pathway are all highly conserved, but the Drosophila genome encodes a single Notch, a single Serrate (SER), 1The abbreviations used are: SER, Serrate; DL, Delta; EGF, epidermal growth factor-like; RNAi, RNA interference; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA; AP, alkaline phosphatase; OFUT1, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1; O-fucose, O-linked fucose. and a single Delta (DL), whereas mammalian genomes encode four Notches, three Deltas, and two Serrates (called Jagged in mammals). Interaction of ligand and receptor triggers proteolytic processing of Notch, resulting in the translocation of the intracellular domain of Notch from the plasma membrane to the nucleus (for review, see Ref. 4Mumm J.S. Kopan R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 228: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, Notch forms a complex with other proteins to regulate the transcription of downstream target genes. Recent studies have revealed that glycosylation is essential for normal Notch signaling. The extracellular domain of Notch includes 36 tandemly repeated epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domains. Many of these EGF domains are subject to an unusual post-translational modification in which fucose is attached in an O-linkage to a serine or threonine residue that occurs right before the third cysteine of the EGF domain (5Moloney D.J. Shair L.H. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9604-9611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). O-linked fucose (O-fucose) is essential for Notch signaling as down-regulation of the enzyme that mediates O-fucosylation by RNAi in Drosophila or by mutation in mouse impairs Notch signaling (6Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Subsequent to the action this enzyme, protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (OFUT1 in Drosophila), O-fucose can be further elongated by the action of another glycosyltransferase, Fringe, which attaches N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) in a β1,3 linkage to EGF-O-fucose (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). In contrast to the general positive requirement for the O-fucose monosaccharide in Notch signaling, studies of Fringe indicate that elongated forms of O-fucose glycans differentially modulate the ability of the two types of Notch ligands to activate the Notch receptor (Refs. 10Hicks C.

Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Genetic and cell culture studies further show that both OFUT1 and Fringe influence Notch signaling cell autonomously (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat.

Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), indicating that they act in the signal receiving cell, presumably by directly glycosylating Notch, which is a substrate for their glycosyltransferase activities (5Moloney D.J.

Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Epistasis analyses indicate that both OFUT1 and Fringe act upstream of the activated (cleaved) form of the Notch receptor (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 10Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat.

Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar), which positions the requirement for O-fucose glycans upstream of the proteolytic cleavages associated with Notch activation. In principle this leaves several possibilities for how O-fucose glycans affect Notch signaling, such as an influence on intracellular trafficking, an influence on Notch-ligand binding, or an influence on Notch proteolysis. The possibility that OFUT1 affects Notch-ligand binding has not been investigated previously, and evidence both for and against the possibility that Fringe influences Notch signaling at the level of Notch-ligand binding has been presented in prior studies (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 10Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat.

Here, we demonstrate that the O-fucose monosaccharide is essential for the normal binding of Notch to its ligands, DL and SER. We also extend prior studies of the influence of O-fucose elongation by demonstrating that Fringe not only enhances DL-Notch binding (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) but also inhibits SER-Notch binding, and we show that OFUT1 overexpression and Fringe expression exert opposing influences on Notch-ligand binding. Our results underscore the central importance of O-fucosylation to Notch signaling and identify a mechanism by which O-fucose glycans exert their influence. Expression Constructs—All proteins were expressed under control of the metallothionein promoter. N:AP and DL:AP expression constructs were from S. Cohen (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar), and FNG and OFUT1 expression constructs have been described previously (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D.

Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We also used an OFUT1 expression construct in which V5 and His6 tags were added to the C terminus (pRmHa3b-Ofut1V5His). These tags have no detectable influence on its enzymatic activity. To express Fc:AP, the plasmid pMT/BIP/Fc:AP was constructed by amplifying DNA encoding amino acids 1-530 of human placental alkaline phosphatase (AP) from the N:AP plasmid (pMT-N-AP/pRMHA-3) (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) using the primers AP forward(CGGAATTCCATCATCCTAGTTGAGGAGGAG) and AP REV (GCTCTAGAGGGAGCAGTGGCCGTCTCCAG), cutting with EcoRI and XbaI, and ligating in-frame with the Fc domain of human IgG from pMT/Bip/Fc (N. Haines). The Fc sequences for pMT/Bip/Fc were isolated by PCR from LFng-Fc (18Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development. 1997; 124: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N-EGF:FLAG (N. Haines) was constructed by PCR amplifying sequences encoding amino acids 66-1452 of Notch using primers ACGAATTCCTGCACAAGTGTCGGTTG and AGTCTAGAGATATCGCAGCGTTTGCC, PCR amplifying a triple FLAG epitope tag from p3xFLAG-CMV-9 (Sigma) using primers GGTCTAGAGACTACAAAGACCATG and TTACCGGTCACTTGTCATCGTCATCA, digesting with EcoRI, XbaI, and AgeI (sites underlined), and ligating into p(MT)1B (N. Haines). Cell-based Notch-Ligand Binding Assays—The binding assay was adopted from the protocol of Bruckner et al. (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and involves mixing conditioned media containing N:AP or Fc:AP with S2 cells expressing a Notch ligand or with control S2 cells. For Preparation of AP Fusion-conditioned Media—Cells were cultured in M3 complete medium (Sigma) in 6-cm dishes to a density of 2-3 × 106/ml (∼80% confluency), then transfected with expression constructs (8 μg of total DNA) using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) in Drosophila SF medium (Invitrogen) for 6 h. They were then cultured for 24 h in M3 complete medium, and then expression was induced in HyQ-CCM3 medium (Hyclone) by the addition of CuSO4 to 0.7 mm. Two days after induction, the conditioned medium was collected, centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris, and assayed for AP activity. Western blotting (not shown) confirmed that AP activity was proportional to amounts of N:AP. For the experiments in Fig. 2A, the N:AP fusion in the conditioned media was concentrated by centrifugation though Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters, 10,000 molecular weight cut-off (Millipore). The amount of AP fusion in the media was equalized among experiments presented in the same panel by the addition of conditioned medium from untransfected S2 cells. When N:AP was co-transfected with OFUT1:V5His or FNG, the total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding vector DNA (pRMHa-3) as needed. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) was prepared as described previously (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). RNAi for Ofut1 was then achieved by adding 40 μg of dsRNA 6 h after transfection. After 1 h, 3 ml of M3 complete medium was then added, and the cells were cultured for 4 days before induction of transgene expression in HyQ-CCM3. For Preparation of Cells for Binding Assays—DL-Expressing cells were a stable transfectant, and SER-expressing cells were transiently transfected (19Rebay I. Fleming R.J. Fehon R.G. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1991; 67: 687-699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar). Control S2 cells for experiments shown were transiently transfected with vector (pRMHa-3). In separate experiments (not shown), the amount of AP activity detected was not affected by transfection of control cells. Cells were cultured to a density of ∼5 × 106/ml in 4 ml of HyQ CCM3 and then induced with 0.7 mm CuSO4 in HyQ CCM3 for 2 days. Cells were then washed in HyQ CCM3 and resuspended in HyQ CCM3 supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. For the Binding Assay—0.3 ml of conditioned media and 0.3 ml of cells were mixed and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with gentle agitation. Cells were then washed 4 times at room temperature with Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.05% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% azide and then lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. Endogenous S2 cell AP was inactivated by heat treatment for 65 °C for 10 min, and bound AP activity was assayed using 6.25 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate as a substrate in 1 m diethanolamine, 5 mm MgCl2, at 37 °C for 30 min. The AP reaction was then stopped by the addition of 1 m NaOH, and AP activity was detected by the formation of a colored product using a spectrophotometer and expressed as milliabsorbance units (at 405 nm) of product formed/min. A mock assay in which S2 cell-conditioned medium was incubated with each corresponding cell type was used as the spectrophotometer blank. In Vitro Notch-Ligand Binding Assays—The binding assay involves mixing conditioned media containing DL:AP, SER:AP, or Fc:AP with agarose beads displaying the extracellular domain of Notch or with control beads. Conditioned media containing AP-tagged proteins was prepared as described above. For Preparation of Beads—5 ml of conditioned media from cells secreting N-EGF:FLAG or control cells transfected with pMT(1B) vector was mixed with 50 ml of Ezview Red anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) at 4 °C overnight and then washed 3 times with 5 ml of Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm CaCl2. Similar amounts of N-EGF:FLAG from normal and RNAi-treated S2 cells were loaded onto beads, and after washing, the amount bound to beads was re-evaluated by Western blotting. For Western blotting, N-EGF:FLAG was detected using a mouse anti-FLAG primary antibody, a horseradish peroxide-coupled anti-mouse secondary antibody, and Supersignal West Dura chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce) and then assayed using a Flourochem 8800 CCD camera system (Alpha Innotech). Amounts were then normalized by diluting N-EGF:FLAG-loaded beads with beads mock-loaded with S2 cell-conditioned medium. For Binding Assay—5 μl of N-EGF:FLAG beads or control beads were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm CaCl2. Beads were then resuspended in 50 μl of conditioned media containing 3000 mAbs/min AP fusion protein, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed 5 times in 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution. AP activity was then assayed as described above. In Vitro Fringe Glycosylation—N:AP or N-EGF:FLAG was isolated from conditioned media using anti-AP or anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma). The amount of Notch on beads was quantified by AP activity for N:AP and by Western blotting N-EGF:FLAG, as described above. After washing three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution, beads were equilibrated with Fringe assay buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm MnCl2). 10 μl of beads were then incubated with purified Fringe:His6 (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F.

Beads were then washed four times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and subjected to scintillation counting. The values reported are subtracted for background and are defined as the counts detected using beads mock-loaded with S2 cell-conditioned medium as a substrate. Antibodies—Antibodies used were mouse anti-DL (C594.9B, DSHB), rat anti-α-tubulin (Serotec), mouse anti-V5 (Invitrogen), mouse anti-WG (4D4, DSHB), rat anti-SER (20Papayannopoulos V. Tomlinson A. Panin V.M. Rauskolb C. Irvine K.D. Science. 1998; 281: 2031-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma), and guinea pig anti-OFUT1. Imaginal discs were stained as described previously (13Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Guinea pig anti-OFUT1 was prepared at Pocono Rabbit Farm by immunization with a peptide sequence corresponding to the C terminus of OFUT1, amino acids 388-402, fused to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Drosophila Stocks and Crosses—l (2)SH2260 (Ofut1SH) flies were obtained from S. Hou (21Oh S.W. Kingsley T. Shin H.H. Zheng Z. Chen H.W. Chen X. Wang H. Ruan P. Moody M. Hou S.X. Genetics. 2003; 163: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar). This mutation was crossed onto FRT42B[G13] by meiotic recombination, and mutant clones were generated by crossing to y w hs-Flp122 ; FRT42B[G13] Ubi-GFP:nls flies and heat-shocking to induce flipase-mediated mitotic recombination (22Xu T. Rubin G.M. Development. 1993; 117: 1223-1237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A Mutation in the Drosophila Ofut1 Gene—The requirement for OFUT1 in Notch signaling has been demonstrated by RNAi in Drosophila (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and by a targeted mutation in the murine Pofut1 gene (6Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Recently, Oh et al. (21Oh S.W. Kingsley T. Shin H.H. Zheng Z. Chen H.W. Chen X. Wang H. Ruan P. Moody M. Hou S.X. Genetics. 2003; 163: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar) described the results of a large scale screen for lethal transposable element insertions in Drosophila. One line, l (2)SH2260, was reported to have an insertion in the 3′ end of Ofut1 (21Oh S.W. Kingsley T. Shin H.H. Zheng Z. Chen H.W. Chen X. Wang H. Ruan P. Moody M. Hou S.X. Genetics. 2003; 163: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar) and is predicted to result in replacement of the seven C-terminal amino acids of OFUT1 with four different amino acids followed by a stop codon (Fig. 1A) (21Oh S.W. Kingsley T. Shin H.H. Zheng Z. Chen H.W. Chen X. Wang H. Ruan P. Moody M. Hou S.X. Genetics. 2003; 163: 195-201PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm that this insertion creates an Ofut1 mutation, we examined animals in which patches of cells were made homozygous mutants for this allele by mitotic recombination. These animals exhibit classic Notch mutant phenotypes, such as wing notching, thickened wing veins, and loss of sensory bristles on the notum (Fig. 1, B-E), consistent with the phenotypes generated by RNAi of Ofut1 (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In developing wing imaginal discs, the expression of targets of Notch signaling, such as Wingless, is lost in cells mutant for Ofut1 (Fig. 1F). This mutation (referred to hereafter as Ofut1SH) thus provides an independent demonstration of the requirement for OFUT1 for Notch signaling in Drosophila and indicates that the seven C-terminal amino acids of OFUT1 are essential for function in vivo. The last four amino acids of OFUT1 conform to a consensus signal for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 1A) (23Wang Y. Shao L. Shi S. Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Stanley P. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40338-40345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 24Andres D.A. Rhodes J.D. Meisel R.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14277-14282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and experiments are in progress to determine whether the loss of function in Ofut1SH is due to loss of enzymatic activity or to mislocalization. A Cell-based Notch-Ligand Binding Assay—Genetic studies imply that O-fucose is required on Notch in order for it to be activated by its ligands (Fig. 1) (6Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this requirement reflects an influence on the binding of Notch to its ligands, we assayed the ability of an AP-tagged extracellular fragment of Notch (N:AP) to bind to ligand-expressing cells. N:AP was secreted into the culture media, and the conditioned media was used for binding studies. This assay has been employed previously to demonstrate that elongation of O-fucose by the N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase Fringe can enhance DL-Notch binding (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although it is possible to assay both N:AP binding to DL-expressing cells and DL:AP binding to Notch-expressing cells, we found that changes in OFUT1 levels affected the amount of N:AP secreted from cells (not shown). Because of a concern that the amount of Notch on the cell surface might vary with different levels of O-fucosylation and the difficulty of controlling for such variations, we focused on assaying N:AP binding to ligand-expressing cells. Amounts of N:AP were determined before incubation with cells and then equalized by dilution with conditioned medium from cultured Drosophila S2 cells. After binding and washing, the amount of N:AP retained by cells was determined by assaying AP activity. S2 cells endogenously express OFUT1, but not Fringe (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). N:AP isolated from otherwise wild-type S2 cells binds to DL-expressing cells (Fig. 2A) (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Although we have not been able to saturate the binding of N:AP to DL-expressing cells, the amount bound is proportional to the amount of N:AP incubated with cells over at least a 40-fold range (Fig. 2A) and is proportional to the amount of DL-expressing cells over at least a 100-fold range (not shown). A much lower signal, which defines the background of the assay, is observed either when a control protein consisting of the Fc domain of human IgG (Fc:AP) is incubated with DL-expressing cells or when N:AP is incubated with S2 cells that do not express a Notch ligand (Fig. 2A). Importantly, we have also been able to detect SER-Notch binding with this assay (Fig. 2A), which was not detected previously (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). As for DL-expressing cells, the amount of N:AP bound to SER-expressing cells is proportional to the amount of N:AP incubated with cells (Fig. 2A). O-Fucosylation Is Required for Notch-Ligand Binding—To determine whether O-fucosylation influences Notch-ligand binding, N:AP was isolated from S2 cells transfected with a N:AP expression construct and simultaneously treated with dsRNA corresponding to Ofut1. In S2 cells, the addition of dsRNA to the culture media is sufficient to promote mRNA degradation through RNAi (25Clemens J.C. Worby C.A. Simonson-Leff N. Muda M. Maehama T. Hemmings B.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Western blotting confirmed that depletion of OFUT1 expression by RNAi was highly effective (Fig. 2B). When N:AP is isolated from S2 cells treated with Ofut1 RNAi (iOfut1), the binding of N:AP to DL-expressing cells is diminished to near background levels (Fig. 2C). A small amount of binding is sometimes observed, which might be due to incomplete inhibition of fucosylation by RNAi or might indicate that O-fucose potentiates binding but is not absolutely required for binding. Regardless, these results imply that O-fucose is required on Notch for normal binding to DL. Similarly, down-regulation of OFUT1 in Notch-secreting cells by RNAi also strongly inhibits SER-N:AP binding (Fig. 2C). The requirement for OFUT1 for both DL-Notch and SER-Notch binding provides an explanation for the severe Notch mutant phenotypes generated by loss of Ofut1 function in vivo (Fig. 1) (6Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OFUT1 Differentially Modulates DL-Notch and SER-Notch Binding—Intriguingly, overexpression of OFUT1 inhibits certain aspects of Notch signaling in Drosophila (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this impairment of Notch signaling might also be effected at the level of Notch-ligand binding, we assayed the consequences of increased OFUT1 expression on the binding of N:AP to ligand-expressing cells. The ability of N:AP isolated from S2 cells that were co-transfected with an OFUT1 expression construct to bind to DL-expressing cells was substantially impaired in comparison to N:AP isolated from control cells (Fig. 3A). By contrast, co-expression of OFUT1 and N:AP actually resulted in enhanced binding of N:AP to SER-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). The distinct effects of OFUT1 overexpression on DL-Notch and SER-Notch binding provide an explanation for the partial inhibition of Notch signaling observed when OFUT1 is overexpressed in the Drosophila notum (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OFUT1 impairs lateral inhibition among proneural cells, which depends solely on DL but does not affect the asymmetric lineage decisions of the sensory organ precursor cells, during which Notch activation can be provided by either SER or DL (26Zeng C. Younger-Shepherd S. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The Influence of OFUT1 Overexpression Is Counteracted by Fringe—Intriguingly, the influence of elevated OFUT1 expression is exactly opposite to that of Fringe in the regulation of Notch signaling (Refs. 10Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 11Klein T. Arias A.M.

Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar; for review, see Ref. 14Haltiwanger R.S. Stanley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1573: 328-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar and 15Haines, N., and Irvine, K. D. (2003) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Therefore, we used the N:AP binding assay to investigate the relationship between the influences of OFUT1 and Fringe on Notch-ligand binding. Expression of Fringe substantially enhances binding of N:AP to DL-expressing cells (Fig. 3A) (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Importantly, when Fringe and OFUT1 are co-expressed, the inhibitory influence of OFUT1 on DL-N:AP binding is suppressed, and DL-N:AP binding is enhanced just as well as in the absence of exogenous OFUT1 (Fig. 3A). The inability to detect N:AP binding to SER in a prior study precluded assessment of the influence of Fringe on SER-Notch binding in Drosophila (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). We find that Fringe can completely inhibit binding of N:AP to SER-expressing cells (Fig. 3B). Moreover, even when Fringe and OFUT1 are co-expressed, the binding of N:AP to SER is effectively blocked by co-expression with Fringe (Fig. 3B). Changes in Glycosylation Associated with Expression of Fringe and OFUT1—To confirm that changes in OFUT1 and Fringe expression are correlated with altered glycosylation of Notch and to provide an indication of the extent to which Notch glycosylation is altered, we employed in vitro glycosylation assays. Because glycosylation by Fringe is restricted to O-fucose on EGF domains (8Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 27Panin V.M. Shao L. Lei L. Moloney D.J. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29945-29952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 28Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), in vivo glycosylation by Fringe is expected to effectively cap O-fucose sites, thus precluding N:AP isolated from Fringe-expressing cells from serving as a Fringe substrate in vitro. Indeed, the N:AP isolated from Fringe-expressing S2 cells was a substantially worse substrate for Fringe than N:AP isolated from S2 cells that do not express Fringe (Fig. 3C). Conversely, if overexpression of OFUT1 modulates Notch-ligand binding by increasing O-fucosylation of Notch, N:AP isolated from cells overexpressing OFUT1 might be expected to be a better substrate for Fringe and a worse substrate for OFUT1. However, this was not the case, as no significant difference in in vitro glycosylation of N:AP was observed (Fig. 3C and data not shown). This raises the possibility that the modulation of Notch-ligand binding by elevated OFUT1 expression is not actually due to altered O-fucosylation. However, it is also possible that O-fucosylation of only one or a few specific EGF domains is responsible for the influence of elevated OFUT1 expression. Because there are 23 potential O-fucose sites on Notch, such a change could be too subtle to be detected in our glycosylation assays. Notch-Ligand Binding in Vitro—We also attempted to confirm that decreased expression of OFUT1 by RNAi reduced glycosylation of N:AP. However, the decreased secretion of N:AP from iOfut1-treated cells created technical difficulties with this experiment. Therefore, we established an alternative Notch-ligand binding assay in which the EGF domains of Notch were fused to a triple FLAG epitope tag (N-EGF:FLAG). RNAi for Ofut1 reduces secretion of N:AP from cells to ∼10% that from untreated cells, but secretion of N-EGF:FLAG is only reduced to 50% that from untreated cells (not shown). To assay Notch-ligand binding, we then bound N-EGF:FLAG to anti-FLAG-agarose beads and mixed these beads with conditioned medium from cells secreting DL:AP, SER:AP, or as a control, Fc:AP. DL:AP and SER:AP bind specifically to N-EGF:FLAG beads and not to control beads without N-EGF:FLAG (Fig 4A). By contrast, when beads are prepared from equivalent amounts of N-EGF:FLAG (as assayed by Western blotting) isolated from cells treated with dsRNA for Ofut1, the binding of SER:AP and DL:AP is substantially decreased (Fig. 4A). This in vitro, bead-based binding assay, thus, provides an independent confirmation of the requirement for O-fucose for Notch-ligand binding. Importantly, in vitro glycosylation then confirmed that N-EGF:FLAG isolated from iOfut1-treated cells is a worse substrate for Fringe than N-EGF:FLAG from untreated S2 cells (Fig. 4B), consistent with the expectation that O-fucosylation of N-EGF:FLAG is impaired by Ofut1 RNAi (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). O-Fucose Is Required for Notch-Ligand Binding—The studies presented here indicate that O-fucosylation is required for the physical binding of Notch to its ligands DL and SER. These binding studies are consistent prior genetic studies, which positioned a requirement for O-fucosylation in signal-receiving cells, upstream of the cleavages associated with Notch activation (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Although our results do not exclude the possibility that O-fucose glycans could also act at other steps, and indeed we detect some influence of Ofut1 RNAi on secretion of Notch extracellular domain fusion proteins, the requirement for O-fucose for Notch-ligand binding can in principle account for the requirement for OFUT1 in Notch signaling. Notably, OFUT1 is required for efficient binding of Notch to both SER and DL. This is consistent with the severe Notch phenotypes observed in vivo when Ofut1 is impaired by mutation or RNAi (Fig. 1) (6Shi S. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5234-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). By contrast, elongation of O-fucose by the GlcNAc transferase Fringe exerts opposing influences on the ability of Notch to bind to SER and DL. Evidence that Fringe influences Notch-ligand binding has been reported previously (9Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 16Shimizu K. Chiba S. Saito T. Kumano K. Takahashi T. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25753-25758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), but other studies have yielded conflicting results (10Hicks C. Johnston S.H. diSibio G. Collazo A. Vogt T.F. Weinmaster G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 17Klueg K.M. Muskavitch M.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3289-3297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our hands, Fringe has clear and reproducible effects on both DL-Notch and SER-Notch binding. Importantly, these effects of Fringe on Notch-ligand binding recapitulate its effects on signaling by these two ligands in Drosophila. The ability of both the O-fucose monosaccharide and elongated forms of O-fucose to influence Notch-ligand binding, the influence of O-fucosylation on binding by both ligands, and the consistent correlations between the effects of O-fucosylation on binding in vitro and its effects on signaling in vivo all argue that O-fucose glycans act at the ligand binding step of Notch signaling. Beyond their importance to understanding regulation of Notch signaling, these observations, thus, provide a striking example of glycosylation as a mechanism for modulating protein-protein interactions. With the determination that O-fucosylation affects Notch-ligand binding, attention must now be turned to elucidating the mechanistic basis for this affect. OFUT1 and Fringe always act in Notch-expressing cells to influence Notch signaling and Notch-ligand binding, which implicates Notch itself as the relevant substrate. However, the actual sites of glycosylation on Notch that mediate the effects of these glycosyltransferases remain to be identified. It is also not yet clear whether the importance of O-fucosylation reflects a role for lectin-like recognition of Notch by its ligands or other co-factors or whether instead O-fucose glycans influence Notch-ligand binding indirectly by altering the conformation or oligomerization of Notch. Differential Modulation of Notch-Ligand Interactions—By contrast to the positive requirement for OFUT1 demonstrated by RNAi, overexpression of OFUT1 enhances SER-Notch binding but inhibits DL-Notch binding. It is intriguing that elevated OFUT1 expression provides a mechanism for differentially modulating the ability of different Notch ligands to interact with the Notch receptor. Previously, the only factor known that could discriminate between the ability of Delta to activate Notch and that of Serrate to activate Notch was Fringe. Indeed, elevated OFUT1 expression might be a mechanism for increasing the sensitivity of cells to the presence or absence of Fringe. In vivo, Fringe only affects a subset of Notch signaling events, and it remains unclear why certain processes are sensitive to Fringe, whereas others are insensitive (for review, see Refs. 15Haines, N., and Irvine, K. D. (2003) Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar and 29Panin V.M. Irvine K.D. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 609-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Because OFUT1 acts oppositely to Fringe, yet its effects can be blocked by Fringe, the relative impact of Fringe on DL-Notch or SER-Notch interactions is expected to be greater in tissues where OFUT1 is expressed at higher levels. Indeed, even though expression of Fringe alone has no obvious effect on the patterning of notal bristles, it has a strong effect when OFUT1 is also overexpressed. Overexpression of OFUT1 inhibits DL-Notch signaling, resulting in the formation of excess sensory bristles, but this effect is partially inhibited by co-expression with Fringe (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition to increasing the sensitivity of Notch signaling events to the presence or absence of Fringe, elevated OFUT1 expression presents a potential mechanism for modulating Notch signaling independently of Fringe. Although the in vivo relevance of Notch-ligand modulation by increased expression of OFUT1 at endogenous levels of expression remains uncertain, we note that certain tissues, such as the lymph gland, express much higher levels of Ofut1 than surrounding cells (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Intriguingly then, in most Drosophila tissues DL is the sole or major Notch ligand. However, in the larval lymph gland, a role for Notch signaling in regulating cell fate decisions during hematopoiesis has recently been described, and SER, rather than DL, is the ligand that regulates Notch in this tissue (30Duvic B. Hoffmann J.A. Meister M. Royet J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1923-1927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 31Lebestky T. Jung S.H. Banerjee U. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These observations provide some support for the possibility that transcriptional regulation of Ofut1 might provide a mechanism for Notch pathway regulation (7Okajima T. Irvine K.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 893-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) and suggest developmental contexts in which this issue may be investigated further. We thank T.

https://openalex.org/W2050424784,"The human multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) transports a wide variety of structurally diverse compounds out of the cell. The drug-binding pocket of P-gp is located in the transmembrane domains. Although occupation of the drug-binding pocket by one molecule is sufficient to activate the ATPase activity of P-gp, the drug-binding pocket may be large enough to accommodate two different substrates at the same time. In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis to test whether P-gp could simultaneously interact with the thiol-reactive drug substrate, Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA) and a second drug substrate. TMEA is a cross-linker substrate of P-gp that allowed us to test for stimulation of cross-linking by a second substrate such as calcein-acetoxymethyl ester, colchicine, demecolcine, cyclosporin A, rhodamine B, progesterone, and verapamil. We report that verapamil induced TMEA cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12). By contrast, no cross-linked product was detected in mutants F343C(TM6), V982C(TM12), or F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of TMEA alone. The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of TMEA decreased with increased cross-linking of the mutant protein. These results show that binding of verapamil must induce changes in the drug-binding pocket (induced-fit mechanism) resulting in exposure of residues F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) to TMEA. The results also indicate that the common drug-binding pocket in P-gp is large enough to accommodate both verapamil and TMEA simultaneously and suggests that the substrates must occupy different regions in the common drug-binding pocket.

TMEA is a cross-linker substrate of P-gp that allowed us to test for stimulation of cross-linking by a second substrate such as calcein-acetoxymethyl ester, colchicine, demecolcine, cyclosporin A, rhodamine B, progesterone, and verapamil. We report that verapamil induced TMEA cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12). By contrast, no cross-linked product was detected in mutants F343C(TM6), V982C(TM12), or F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of TMEA alone. The verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of TMEA decreased with increased cross-linking of the mutant protein. These results show that binding of verapamil must induce changes in the drug-binding pocket (induced-fit mechanism) resulting in exposure of residues F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) to TMEA. The results also indicate that the common drug-binding pocket in P-gp is large enough to accommodate both verapamil and TMEA simultaneously and suggests that the substrates must occupy different regions in the common drug-binding pocket.

The 1280 amino acids of P-gp are arranged as two repeating units of 610 amino acids that are joined by a linker region of about 60 amino acids (6Chen C.J. Chin J.E. Ueda K. Clark D.P. Pastan I.

An important goal in understanding the mechanism of P-gp is to determine the location and number of drug-binding sites. Studies with thiol-reactive substrate analogs of P-gp and cysteine mutants have shown that residues from multiple TM segments contribute to a common drug-binding pocket (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J.

P-gp in the resting state is in the “closed” conformation where the cytoplasmic ends of the TM segments are close to each other but far apart at the extracellular end of the molecule (20Loo T.W.

A. 2002; 99: 3511-3516Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Covalent binding of a single molecule of the drug substrate verapamil in the drug-binding pocket was sufficient to permanently activate P-gp (24Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20449-20452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The dimensions of the P-gp drug-binding pocket as determined with thiol-reactive cross-linker substrates, however, indicated the drug-binding pocket may accommodate more than one substrate at the same time (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). To determine whether more than one substrate could bind to P-gp at the same time, we used the drug substrate Tris-(2-maleimidoethyl)amine (TMEA). TMEA is a useful compound for analyzing the P-gp drug-binding pocket because it will cross-link cysteine residues if they are close to the binding site of TMEA. Binding of a second drug substrate will inhibit TMEA cross-linking if there is significant overlap of the binding sites. Similarly, cross-linking could be unaffected or enhanced if the binding site of the second drug substrate does not overlap that of TMEA. In this study, we used cysteine-scanning mutagenesis and reaction with TMEA in the presence of other drug substrates to determine whether P-gp could simultaneously bind to two different drug substrates in the common drug-binding pocket. Construction of Mutants—Cysteine residues were introduced into a histidine-tagged Cys-less P-gp cDNA (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cys-less P-gp was constructed by replacing the seven endogenous cysteines at positions 137, 431, 717, 956, 1074, 1125, and 1227 with alanines (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The Cys-less P-gp retained the ability to confer multidrug resistance and exhibited drug-stimulated ATPase activity (7Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

The presence of the histidine tag facilitated purification of the mutant P-gps by nickel-chelate chromatography (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Treatment of Mutants with TMEA—HEK 293 cells (10 10-cm diameter plates) were transfected with the mutant cDNAs. After 24 h, the media were replaced with fresh media and the cells grown for 72 h at 27 °C. Membranes were prepared and suspended in 200 μl of Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) as described previously (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test the effect of drug substrates on cross-linking by TMEA, the membranes were pre-incubated with no drug or saturating levels of calcein-AM (1 mm), colchicine (10 mm), demecolcine (2 mm), cyclosporin A (0.2 mm), progesterone (2 mm), rhodamine B (2 mm), verapamil (1 mm), R(+)-verapamil (1 mm) or S(–)-verapamil (1 mm) (Sigma) for 10 min at 21 °C. The mixtures were then incubated for 15 min at 21 °C in the presence of 0, 0.1, or 1 mm TMEA. The reactions were stopped by addition of 300 mm cysteine, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 30 mm. After another 10 min at 21 °C, SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 4% (w/v) SDS, and 4%(v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) was added. The mixtures were subjected to immunoblot analysis with rabbit polyclonal anti-P-gp antibody (28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). To monitor the time course of verapamil-stimulated TMEA cross-linking, the membranes were pre-incubated with 1 mm verapamil for 10 min at 21 °C. The membranes were then incubated for 0–32 min in the presence of 0.1 mm TMEA. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 30 mm cysteine. To monitor the dependence of cross-linking on TMEA concentration, membranes were pre-incubated with 1 mm verapamil for 10 min at 21 °C and then treated with various concentrations (0–1 mm) of TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 30 mm cysteine. The dependence of TMEA cross-linking on verapamil concentration was determined by pre-incubating the membranes in the presence of various concentrations (0–1 mm) of verapamil for 10 min at 21 °C followed by treatment with 0.1 mm TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer containing 30 mm cysteine. Expression, Purification, and Measurement of Drug-stimulated ATPase Activity of P-gp Mutants—HEK 293 cells were transfected with the mutant cDNAs. The medium was replaced after 24 h with fresh medium containing 10 μm cyclosporin A. Cyclosporin A is a substrate of P-gp and acts as a powerful chemical chaperone in promoting maturation of P-gp and increases the yield of mature P-gp (29Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 27585-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). After another 24 h, the transfected cells were harvested, and the mutants were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography. The isolated mutant P-gps were mixed with lipid (sheep brain lipid, type IIs, Sigma) and sonicated as described previously (26Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21449-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). An aliquot of the P-gp/lipid mixture was incubated with 1 mm verapamil for 10 min at 21 °C and then treated with various concentrations (0–1 mm) of TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of cysteine, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 30 mm. After another 10 min at 21 °C, the samples were mixed with an equal volume of ATPase buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP and no verapamil or 1 mm verapamil. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and the amount of inorganic phosphate liberated was determined (33Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). We had shown that the P-gp drug-binding pocket is shaped liked a “funnel,” i.e. narrow at the cytoplasmic side, at least 9 Å in the middle, and even wider at the extracellular side (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appeared that the drug-binding pocket was potentially large enough to simultaneously accommodate more than one substrate. To determine whether two different substrates could bind at the same time, we tested double cysteine mutants for drug-stimulated cross-linking with the thiol-reactive cross-linker TMEA (see Fig. 3 for structure). The rationale was that binding of the first drug substrate would cause a substrate-induced conformational change in the drug-binding pocket so that it would promote cross-linking of neighboring cysteine residues by TMEA if the drug-binding site of the first substrate did not overlap that of TMEA. Cross-linking in P-gp is readily detectable because the cross-linked product migrates with lower mobility on SDS-PAGE gels (34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Urbatsch I.L. Gimi K. Wilke-Mounts S. Lerner-Marmarosh N. Rousseau M.E. Gros P. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26980-26987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TMEA was selected as the cross-linker because it is a P-gp substrate (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); it is relatively small (10.3 Å spacer arm), and it has three thiol-reactive maleimide side chains that can form non-cleavable thioester linkages. Accordingly, membranes from cells expressing P-gp mutants with one cysteine in the NH2-terminal TM domain (TM6) and a second cysteine in the COOH-terminal TM domain (TM12) were pre-incubated with saturating concentrations of the drug substrates calcein-AM (1 mm), colchicine (10 mm), demecolcine (2 mm), cyclosporin A (0.2 mm), progesterone (2 mm), rhodamine B (2 mm), verapamil (1 mm), R(+)-verapamil (1 mm), or S(–)-verapamil (1 mm). The membranes were then treated with 0.1 mm TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. The reactions were done at 21 °C because maleimides react very slowly at low temperature (36Kenyon G.L. Bruice T.W. Methods Enzymol. 1977; 47: 407-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), whereas incubation at a higher temperature (37 °C) results in increased thermal motion in P-gp. The reactions were stopped by addition of cysteine and the samples subjected to immunoblot analysis. One mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) showed substrate-stimulated cross-linking with TMEA. Verapamil, R(+)-verapamil, and S(–)-verapamil promoted cross-linking of P-gp with TMEA (Fig. 1A). By contrast, none of the drug substrates promoted cross-linking in mutant F343C(TM6) or mutant V982C(TM12) (Fig. 1, B and C). Similarly, the drug substrates did not promote cross-linking in mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the absence of TMEA (Fig. 1D). Similar results were obtained when cross-linking was carried out with 1 mm TMEA (data not shown).Fig. 1Effect of drugs on cross-linking of P-gp mutants. Membranes were prepared from HEK 293 cells expressing P-gp mutants F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) (A and D), F343C(TM6) (B), or V982C(TM12) (C). The membranes were pre-incubated at 21 °C for 10 min with no drug (No Drug), calcein-AM (CAM), colchicine (Colch), demecolcine (Deme), cyclosporin A (Cyclo), rhodamine B (Rhod), progesterone (Prog), verapamil (Ver), R(+)-verapamil (R-Ver), or S(–)-verapamil (S-Ver). The reaction mixtures were then treated with (+) or without (–) 0.1 mm TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. The reactions were stopped by addition of cysteine and SDS sample buffer. The mixtures were subjected to immunoblot analysis. The positions of the cross-linked (X-link) product and mature (170 kDa) P-gps are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both stereoisomers of verapamil, R(+)-verapamil and S(–)-verapamil, promoted TMEA cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) (Fig. 1A). This is consistent with our observation that both isomers were equal in their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of wild-type P-gp (about 15-fold stimulation; Km about 30 μm). Mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) showed a time-dependent increase in the level of cross-linking (Fig. 2A). In the presence of 0.1 mm TMEA and 1 mm verapamil, cross-linked product was detected after 4 min at 21 °C. After 32 min, the majority (>80%) of the mutant protein was cross-linked. The dependence of cross-linking on TMEA concentration was also determined. Membranes from mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) were pre-incubated with 1 mm verapamil and then reacted with various concentrations (0–1 mm) of TMEA. Fig. 2B shows cross-linked product was readily detected in the presence of 0.1–1 mm TMEA. Similarly, the dependence of TMEA cross-linking on the verapamil concentration was determined by pre-incubating membranes with various concentrations of verapamil (0 to 1 mm) followed by treatment with 0.1 mm TMEA for 15 min at 21 °C. Cross-linked product was detected at 3 μm verapamil. The amount of cross-linked product increased with increasing concentrations of verapamil, with >50% of the mutant cross-linked in the presence of 0.3 or 1 mm verapamil. To determine whether the active form of the mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) was reacting with TMEA, we tested for inhibition of drug-stimulated ATPase activity. The rationale was that cross-linking should cause inhibition of activity because activity is dependent on rearrangement of TM segments within P-gp (37Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20986-20989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19435-19438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly, histidine-tagged Cys-less, F343C(TM6), V982C(TM12), and F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) mutant P-gps were isolated by nickel-chelate chromatography, mixed with lipid, sonicated, and samples incubated for 10 min at 21 °C in the presence of 1 mm verapamil. The samples were then treated for 15 min at 21 °C in the presence of various concentrations (0–1 mm) of TMEA. The reactions were quenched by addition of cysteine, and verapamil-stimulated ATPase activities were determined. The activity of the Cys-less P-gp was not inhibited by TMEA (data not shown) (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). There was good correlation, however, between the concentration of TMEA required for substantial cross-linking (0.1–1 mm TMEA; Fig. 2B) and the concentration (0.1 to 1 mm) required for more than 50% inhibition of the activity of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12). Half-maximal inhibition occurred at 84 μm TMEA. The mutants F343C(TM6) and V982C(TM12) were also tested for inhibition by TMEA. We previously reported that the activity of mutant V982C(TM12) showed half-maximal inhibition at 420 μm TMEA when incubated with TMEA in the absence of verapamil (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the present study, incubation of mutant V982C(TM12) with TMEA in the presence of 1 mm verapamil gave a similar pattern of inhibition, with half-maximal inhibition occurring at 410 μm TMEA (Fig. 3). Mutant F343C(TM6) showed a dramatic change in sensitivity to TMEA when verapamil was present. TMEA had little effect on the activity of mutant F343C(TM6) in the absence of verapamil (Fig. 3). Incubation of mutant F343C(TM6) in the presence of 1 mm verapamil, however, caused a large increase in sensitivity of TMEA. The activity of the mutant was inhibited by more than 75% in the presence of verapamil and 1 mm TMEA. Half-maximal inhibition of verapamil-stimulated ATPase activity occurred at 180 μm TMEA. It appears that the presence of verapamil increased the reactivity or proximity of F343C to TMEA. In a previous study (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we showed that TMEA alone could cross-link mutant L339C(TM6)/V982(TM12). In this mutant cross-linking was inhibited by the presence of verapamil. By contrast, cross-linking in mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) by TMEA occurred only in the presence of verapamil (Figs. 1 and 2). An explanation for these differences is that binding of verapamil causes conformational changes in TM6 resulting in changes in the positions of residues 339 and 343. Such substrate-induced conformational changes add further support for the substrate-induced fit mechanism of binding. We had shown previously (39Loo T.W. Bartlett M.C. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13603-13606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) that drug substrates such as colchicine, cyclosporin A, demecolcine, and progesterone can promote direct cross-linking between cysteine residues in the TM segments lining the putative drug-binding pocket with a zero length cross-linker (copper phenanthroline). It was found that progesterone promoted cross-linking in mutants P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12), and P350C(TM6)/A935C(TM11); cyclosporin A promoted cross-linking in mutant P350C(TM6)/G939C(TM11), and colchicine and demecolcine promoted cross-linking in mutant P350C(TM6)/V991C(TM12). When TM6 is modeled as an α-helical wheel, residues 339 and 343 are on the same face of the helix but separated by a turn of the helix (Fig. 4A). Binding of verapamil would cause a 5-Å displacement of TM6 toward the extracellular side. This would cause Cys-343 to move to a more favored position to react with TMEA. Movements of such magnitude have been reported with TM segments that line the calcium-binding site in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1) ATPase (40Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of SERCA1 with and without bound calcium shows movements in TMs 3 and 4 of about a 5 Å toward the outside of the membrane. The ability of drug substrates to alter the structure of a protein has also been reported for other multidrug-binding regulatory proteins. The multidrug-binding protein QacR is a soluble regulatory protein from Staphylococcus aureus whose expression can be induced by structurally diverse cationic lipophilic drugs. The crystal structures of QacR complexed with six different drugs were reported (41Schumacher M.A. Miller M.C. Grkovic S. Brown M.H. Skurray R.A. Brennan R.G. Science. 2001; 294: 2158-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). QacR forms a dimer and binds one ligand. A stoichiometry of 1 ligand per dimer has also been reported for other multidrug-binding proteins such as EmrR and BmrR (42Ahmed M. Borsch C.M. Taylor S.S. Vazquez-Laslop N. Neyfakh A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28506-28513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Brooun A. Tomashek J.J. Lewis K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5131-5133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand binding induced large conformational changes in the drug-binding pocket of QacR and indicated the presence of two separate potentially overlapping binding sites within a single pocket that was surrounded by five α-helices. Analysis of the drug-binding pocket of P-gp indicates that it may share many features with QacR. In the absence of drug substrates, the six TM segments (TMs 4–6 and 10–12) that contribute residues to the drug-binding site are close to each other because cysteines in TMs 4–6 can be directly cross-linked to cysteines in TMs 10–12 with copper phenanthroline (zero length cross-linker) (22Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5253-5256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 34Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27482-27487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Binding of drug substrates increases the distance between TMs 4–6 and TMs 10–12 to at least 10–15 Å (20Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36877-36880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). It is interesting that these distances are consistent with those reported recently between opposing TM6 helices (14 Å) of the ABC transporter MsbA from Vibrio cholera (44Chang G. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 330: 419-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of MsbA was in the closed conformation. MsbA has some homology to P-gp and requires two monomers to form the minimum functional unit. The ability of verapamil to promote cross-linking of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) with TMEA indicates that both verapamil and TMEA can simultaneously occupy the drug-binding pocket. The results also suggest that binding of one rather than two TMEA molecules occurred because cross-linking by TMEA was almost complete in mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of verapamil. Binding of two TMEA molecules would have resulted in little cross-linking. The cross-linking pattern of mutant F343C(TM6)/V982C(TM12) in the presence of verapamil plus TMEA suggests that single molecules of verapamil and TMEA are bound to sites that are close to each other in the drug-binding pocket. Kinetic and labeling studies suggest that P-gp has up to three different drug-binding sites (45Shapiro A.B. Ling V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 122-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 46Garrigos M. Mir L.M. Orlowski S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 664-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 47Dey S. Ramachandra M. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Ambudkar S.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10594-10599Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). One way of reconciling these results is through a model. Fig. 4B shows that the drug-binding pocket is located at the interface between the TM domains from both halves of P-gp. Within this binding pocket are regions that bind to specific drug substrates whose sites could potentially overlap. Our results support the presence of two distinct sites within the drug-binding pocket. TMEA is a substrate of P-gp because it can stimulate the ATPase activity of Cys-less P-gp (25Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31800-31805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although TMEA cross-linked C343(TM6) and C982(TM12), this position may not be the exact TMEA drug-binding site that leads to ATPase activation and transport. The exact location could not be determined because cross-linking of mutant C343(TM6)/C982(TM12) produced an inactive protein. The TMEA-binding site is probably close by, but because verapamil caused conformational changes in P-gp, the TMEA-binding site may also have been altered in a way that allows the TMEA molecule to act as a “reporter” of any conformational change. Fig. 4C shows a model of verapamil-induced conformational change promoting cross-linking between C343(TM6) and C982(TM12). Binding of verapamil causes TM6 to move toward the extracellular surface through a turn of the helix. This results in exposure of Cys-343 so that it can be cross-linked to C982 with TMEA. In summary, the results from this study provide further evidence for the substrate-induced fit mechanism for drug binding and that two different substrates can bind simultaneously in the same drug-binding pocket."

To determine the physiological roles of this phosphorylation event in p53-dependent DNA damage responses, a Ser18 to Ala missense mutation was introduced into the germline of mice. Thymocytes and fibroblasts from the knock-in mice show reduced transactivation of many p53 target genes following DNA damage. p53 protein stabilization and DNA binding are similar in knock-in and wild type mice, but C-terminal acetylation was defective, consistent with a role for Ser18 in the recruitment of transcriptional co-activators. The apoptotic response of knock-in thymocytes to ionizing radiation is intermediate between that of wild type and p53 null thymocytes. Despite impaired transcriptional and apoptotic responses, the knock-in mice are not prone to spontaneous tumorigenesis. This indicates that neither phosphorylation of p53 on Ser18 by ATM nor a full transcriptional response is essential to prevent spontaneous tumor formation in mice.

This indicates that neither phosphorylation of p53 on Ser18 by ATM nor a full transcriptional response is essential to prevent spontaneous tumor formation in mice. p53 is the most commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers and plays two main roles in cellular responses to stresses. It causes cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, partly depending on the cell types (1Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7457) Google Scholar, 2Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Both p53-triggered responses can protect the genome from accumulating mutations and passing these mutations on to the daughter cells. Structural and functional analyses of p53 have shown that p53 is a transcription factor with a sequence-specific DNA-binding domain in the central region and a transcriptional activation domain at the N terminus. Three additional domains, including a nuclear localization signal, a tetramerization domain, and an extreme C-terminal regulatory domain, are present in the C terminus of p53 (2Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). The transcriptional activities of p53 are essential for both p53-dependent cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (3Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 4Jimenez G.S. Nister M. Stommel J.M. Beeche M. Barcarse E.A. Zhang X.Q. O'Gorman S. Wahl G.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage and other sources of cellular stresses, the protein levels of p53 are greatly up-regulated, and its transcriptional activities are significantly induced (2Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear how these stresses signal p53 responses. The p53 protein level is regulated post-transcriptionally, and up-regulation of p53 following DNA damages is mainly due to increased protein stability (5Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). The interaction between p53 and Mdm2, a transcriptional target of p53, represents a negative feedback regulatory mechanism for the rapid turnover of p53 in normal cells (6Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3718) Google Scholar, 7Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2846) Google Scholar). In this context, p53 is degraded through a ubiquitin-dependent pathway, and Mdm2 functions as the p53-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (8Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar, 9Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence suggests that phosphorylation of p53 might play important roles in regulating p53 stability and activity (5Appella E. Anderson C.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 2764-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Both human and mouse p53 are phosphorylated at multiple sites at the N and C terminus both in vivo and in vitro by a number of kinases. In this context, phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 occurs rapidly following DNA damage and requires the ATM family protein kinases (10Canman C.E. Chen C.Y. Lee M.H. Kastan M.B. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1994; 59: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L. Smorodinsky N.I. Prives C. Reiss Y. Shiloh Y. Ziv Y.

A number of studies have sought to elucidate the role of Ser15 phosphorylation in regulating p53 stability and activity. One study reported that phosphorylation of p53 at Ser15 disrupted its interactions with Mdm2, leading to p53 stabilization (13Shieh S.Y. Ikeda M. Taya Y. Prives C. Cell. 1997; 91: 325-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). Others have argued that Ser15 phosphorylation is required for the acetylation of p53 at C-terminal Lys residues but dispensable for p53-Mdm2 interaction (14Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K. Giordano A. Levine A.S. Kelly K. Cell. 1997; 89: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 15Lambert P.F. Kashanchi F. Radonovich M.F. Shiekhattar R. Brady J.N. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 463: 312-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To address the importance of Ser15 phosphorylation in p53 responses to DNA damage, we introduced a missense Ser18 (corresponding to Ser15 of human p53) to Ala mutation into the endogenous p53 gene of mouse embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; IR, ionizing radiation; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation. cells. Analysis of homozygous mutant p53S18A ES cells indicated that phosphorylation of mouse p53 at Ser18 is important for the maximum induction of p53 protein levels after DNA damage (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, p53-dependent cell cycle G1 arrest and induction of p21 were impaired in p53S18A-differentiated ES cells (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, p53 acetylation at the extreme C terminus is normal in p53S18A ES cells. These previous findings support a role for Ser18 phosphorylation in regulating p53 responses to DNA damage. However, considering that the ES cell is an atypical cell type in the regulation of p53 stability and activity (18Aladjem M.I. Spike B.T. Rodewald L.W. Hope T.J. Klemm M. Jaenisch R. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we introduced the p53S18A mutation into mouse germline. Construction of p53S18A Mice—p53S18A ES cells were described previously (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The heterozygous mutant ES cells were injected into C57/BL6 blastocysts to generate chimeric mice that transmitted the mutation into mouse germline. The germline-transmitted mice were bred with CMV-Cre mice to excise the PGK-neor gene from the targeted alleles. Heterozygous mutant mice were intercrossed to generate p53S18A mice. Western Blotting Analysis—Protein extracts from 4 × 105 MEFs or 5 × 106 mouse thymocytes were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8% (for Mdm2), 12% (p53), or 15% (p21) polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% dry milk and probed with a monoclonal antibody against p53 (pAb240; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), a polyclonal antibody against p53 (CM-5; Vector Laboratories Inc.), a polyclonal antibody against p21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), or a monoclonal antibody against Mdm2 (2A10; Oncogene Science). The filter was then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, developed with ECL Plus from Amersham Biosciences. To determine whether the amount of proteins in each lane was comparable, the filter was stripped and probed with a goat polyclonal antibody against β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). To detect p53 acetylation at the C terminus, MEFs were exposed to UV light (60 J/M2) and treated with 5 μm thichostatin A for 4 h before harvesting. Cell extracts from the irradiated and untreated controls were analyzed by Western blot with antibodies specific for p53 or p53 acetylated at Lys379. Rabbit polyclonal antibody against murine p53 acetylated at Lys379 was described previously (3Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis—Cell cycle G1/S arrest was performed as previously described (19Xu Y. Yang E.M. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, subconfluent MEFs were synchronized at G0 by serum starvation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal calf serum for 96 h. Irradiated or untreated G0 synchronized cells were trypsinized and plated in 10-cm-diameter plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/plate in normal growth medium supplemented with 10 mm bromodeoxyuridine. After 24 h of bromodeoxyuridine labeling, the cells were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stored at –20 °C. DNA content and DNA synthesis were analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described (19Xu Y. Yang E.M. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). p53-dependent Apoptosis in Mouse Thymocytes—Single cell suspension of thymocytes were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, at a density of 106 cells/ml and treated with increasing dosages of IR. Ten hours after treatment, the percentages of apoptotic thymocytes were determined by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Annexin V (Pharmingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry as described (3Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from thymocytes of untreated or irradiated (5 grays) mice 8 h after IR with a Qiagen RNeasy extraction kit. RNA amount and quality were monitored with Agilent Nano6000 RNA chips (Agilent Technologies). Ten micrograms of total RNA from each thymocyte sample were reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), converted into double-stranded cDNA, and then biotin-labeled during in vitro transcription using the ENZO RNA Transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix, Sunnydale, CA) according to Affymetrix recommended protocols. Each sample was pre-tested for RNA integrity by hybridization to Affymetrix Test3 chips and then hybridized to Affymetrix Murine Genome U74Av2 expression arrays, which interrogate ∼12,600 murine sequences (listed at www.affymetrix.com). Data from microarray experiments were evaluated by Affymetrix MAS 5.0 and DMT software. Following scanning of each oligonucleotide array, the average signal intensity (sum of all intensities/number of sequence) was set to 100. Real Time PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from MEFs or thymocytes with the combination of Trizol (Invitrogen) and RNeasy RNA Cleanup (Qiagen). RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase for 20 min (Roche Applied Science) at room temperature before being reverse transcribed using Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed on an MX-400 machine (Stratagene) with SyBr Green PCR Master Mix (ABI). PCR conditions consisted of a 10-min hot start at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 61 °C. The average threshold cycle (C t) for each gene was determined from triplicate reactions, and levels of gene expression relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were determined as previously described (20Boley S.E. Wong V.A. French J.E. Recio L. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 66: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The primer sequences for p21, Bax, and cyclin G were described (20Boley S.E. Wong V.A. French J.E. Recio L. Toxicol. Sci. 2002; 66: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other primers are listed below: Mdm2 primers, 5′-ATTGCCTGGATCAGGATTCAGTT-3′ and ACCTCATCATCCTCATCTGAGA-3′; Noxa primers, 5′-CCACCTGAGTTCGCAGCTCAA-3′ and 5′-GTTGAGCACACTCGTCCTTCAA-3′; Perp primers, 5′-TCATCCTGTGCATCTGCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGTTATCGTGAAGCCTGAA-3′; 14-3-3σ primers, 5′-GCCGAACGGTATGAAGACAT-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCGTTGCTCTTCTGCT-3′; and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers, 5′-CCAGTATGACTCCACTCACG-3′ and 5′-GACTCCACGACATACTCAGC-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP analysis of in vivo binding of p53 to p53-dependent promoters was performed essentially as described (21Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). For ChIP, 1.6 × 106 MEFs in a 10-cm dish were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Formaldehyde was neutralized by the addition of 125 mm glycine for 5 min. The cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping in 1 ml of 1% SDS 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mg/liter sonicated salmon sperm DNA and protease inhibitors (15 mg/liter aprotinin, 2 mg/liter leupeptin, and 0.2 g/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were vortexed, and insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. The pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 0.25% SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mg/l sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and protease inhibitors and sonicated to an average fragment size of 0.6 kb using a Microtip on a Branson sonicator. The remaining insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was diluted with 2 volumes of 1% Nonidet P-40, 350 mm NaCl and split in three samples. Each ChIP was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with 10 μl of antibody-coated paramagnetic protein G beads (Dynal). One μg PAb248 (22Yewdell J.W. Gannon J.V. Lane D.P. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 444-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used per ChIP. Immune complexes were collected with a magnet, washed four times in 1% Nonidet P-40, 350 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resuspended in 125 μl of 1% SDS, and eluted by heating to 85 °C for 10 min. Cross-linking was reversed by incubation of the eluate for 6 h at 65 °C. The samples were diluted with 125 μl of water containing 160 mg/liter proteinase K and incubated for 1 h at 50 °C. DNA was purified by extraction with phenolchloroform and precipitated with isopropanol and glycogen. Quantitative PCR was performed on a PE5700 PCR machine using a SYBR Master Mix (Perkin Elmer). The PCR cycles were 50 °C for 2 min to digest dUTP-containing DNA and 95 °C for 10 min to activate Taq Gold polymerase, and then there were cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min repeated 40 times, except for the Mdm2 primers where the annealing temperature was 62 °C. The primer sequences are: Mdm2, forward primer 5′-GGTCAAGTTGGGACACGTCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGCGTTTAAATAACCCCAGCTG-3′; PERP distal promoter, forward primer 5′-CACCTATATAAGGCTATGTGTAGAGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′ TACAATATCATATGGAGGAATCTAGTCTGTG 3′; and PERP proximal promoter, forward primer 5′-TCACAGGCTATTGGGATGTCC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AACACAGTGTAAGGAGCATGGCT-3′. For ChIP analysis of histone acetylation at p53-dependent promoters, anti-acetyl histone H3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to immunoprecipitate acetylated chromatin. The primers to detect the promoters of Mdm2, p21, and β-actin are: p21, forward primer 5′-CCTTTCTATCAGCCCCAGAGGATA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGGACATCCTTAATTATCTGGGGT-3′; Mdm2, forward primer 5′-GGTGCCTGGTCCCGGACTCGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AGAGGGTCCCCCAGGGGTGTC-3′; and β-actin, forward primer 5′-TTACGCCTAGCGTGTAGACTCT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AATACTGTGTACTCTCAAGATGGA-3′. p53-dependent Activities in Thymocytes after IR—Mouse thymocytes undergo p53-dependent apoptosis after IR (23Lowe S.W. Schmitt E.M. Smith S.W. Osborne B.A. Jacks T. Nature. 1993; 362: 847-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (2764) Google Scholar, 24Clarke A.R. Purdie C.A. Harrison D.J. Morris R.G. Bird C.C. Hooper M.L. Wyllie A.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 849-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). Therefore, to test the functions of p53 phosphorylation at Ser18 in regulating p53 apoptotic activities, we analyzed p53 stabilization and p53-dependent apoptosis in p53S18A thymocytes after IR essentially as described (25Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The protein levels of p53 were induced similarly in p53S18A and wild type thymocytes after IR (Fig. 1A). However, p53-dependent apoptosis was significantly impaired in p53S18A thymocytes after IR, indicating that Ser18 phosphorylation was not required for p53 accumulation but was important to fully activate p53 apoptotic activities (Fig. 1B). To better define the basis for the impaired p53-dependent apoptosis in p53S18A thymocytes after IR, we profiled the global gene expression in both wild type and p53S18A thymocytes before and after IR by microarray analysis. Scatter graphs from duplicate experiments (two sets of treated wild type and p53S18A thymocytes and two sets of untreated controls) show high reproducibility. Upon IR treatment, clear differences between wild type and p53S18A thymocytes were revealed with respect to overall transcriptional response to IR. In this context, mRNA levels of the known p53-inducible downstream genes p21, Perp, SNK, 14-3-3σ, and tumor necrosis factor α were increased to considerably higher levels in wild type thymocytes than in p53S18A thymocytes after IR (Table I). However, the impacts of p53S18A mutation on p53-dependent gene expression appear to be promoter-specific, because a number of other known p53 downstream target genes, including Mdm2, Noxa, Bax, Apaf1, and Wig1, were similarly induced in p53S18A thymocytes as in wild type thymocytes after IR (Table I). The differential induction of a number of p53-dependent genes including p21, Mdm2, Noxa, Perp, cyclin G, and 14-3-3σ in wild type and p53S18A thymocytes after IR was further confirmed by quantitative real time PCR analysis (Fig. 2A).Table IFold induction of the mRNA levels of well known p53-dependent genes in wild type and p53S18A thymocytes after IR as determined by Affymetrix gene chip system.Folds of induction in thymocytes after IRGenesWild typep53S18AExpt. 1Expt. 2AverageExpt. 1Expt. 2Averagep21121513.52.864.4Mdm21.71.51.61.52.5214-3-3σ6.266.11.92.12TNF-α4.786.40.71.20.95C/EBP1411.512.752.21.31.75SNK167.511.753.43.33.3Calcyclin1814160.50.80.7Perp8.54.56.5312Apaf142333.53.25Bax44.54.25565.5BLK121.5243Wig-16456.587.25Pig83.52.532.73.22.95 Open table in a new tab The promoter-specific effects of S18A mutation on the expression of p53 target genes could be due to the differential requirement of Ser18 phosphorylation in the recruitment of co-activators to the distinct p53-dependent promoters. Therefore, we employed a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to analyze the histone H3 acetylation at two promoters of p53-dependent genes, Mdm2, Noxa, and p21, in wild type and p53S18A thymocytes with or without IR treatment. As an internal control, histone H3 acetylation at β-actin promoter was also analyzed. Histone acetylation of the Mdm2 promoter was increased to a similar extent in both wild type and p53S18A thymocytes after IR (Fig. 2C). However, histone acetylation of the p21 promoter was reduced in p53S18A thymocytes after IR when compared with that of wild type thymocyte (Fig. 2C). The correlation between the expression levels of Mdm2, Noxa, and p21, and histone acetylation of their promoters suggests that Ser18 phosphorylation is important to recruit co-activators to some but not all p53-dependent promoters. p53 Induction in p53S18A MEFs after DNA Damage—To define the roles of Ser18 phosphorylation in p53 responses to DNA damage in MEFs, p53 protein levels in p53S18A MEFs at different time points after IR and UV radiation were analyzed by Western blotting. Unexpectedly, we found that p53 was induced to higher peak levels in p53S18A MEFs than in wild type MEFs (Fig. 3, A and B). Because Mdm2-p53 interaction plays a major role in regulating p53 stability, we analyzed p53-Mdm2 interaction by co-immunoprecipitation assay in wild type and p53S18A MEFs at different time points after UV radiation (25Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated that p53-Mdm2 interaction was disrupted in both wild type and p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 3C). Therefore, Ser18 phosphorylation was not required to disrupt p53-Mdm2 interaction after UV radiation. However, p53-Mdm2 interaction appeared to be relatively weaker in p53S18A MEFs than that in wild type MEFs at various time points after UV radiation, thus providing the potential basis for the higher protein levels of p53 in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation. To further understand the basis for the reduced p53-Mdm2 interaction in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, we analyzed the induction of Mdm2 mRNA in p53S18A and wild type MEFs after UV radiation by quantitative real time PCR. In contrast to the findings that higher Mdm2 mRNA levels were detected in p53S18A thymocytes after IR, Mdm2 mRNA levels were significantly lower in p53S18A MEFs than in wild type MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 2B). Mdm2 mRNA levels were also reduced in p53S18A MEFs after IR, indicating that the differential impacts of the S18A mutations on the Mdm2 expression in thymocytes and MEFs were not due to the distinct types of DNA damage (data not shown). The reduced Mdm2 induction in p53S18A MEFs could account for the higher levels of p53 accumulation in these cells after DNA damage. Induction of other analyzed p53-dependent genes was also reduced in MEFs after both UV radiation (Fig. 2B). p53-dependent Activities in p53S18A MEFs after UV Radiation—To test whether the high levels of p53 protein are functional in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, we assayed the G1 cell cycle arrest in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation as described (19Xu Y. Yang E.M. Brugarolas J. Jacks T. Baltimore D. Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 4385-4390Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The G1/S cell cycle arrest was significantly impaired in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, indicating that Ser18 phosphorylation is required for the activation of this p53 activity after DNA damage in MEFs (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this notion, p53-dependent induction of p21 was reduced in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 2B). Phosphorylation of p53 at the N terminus was suggested to be involved in the nuclear retention of p53 (26Zhang Y. Xiong Y. Science. 2001; 292: 1910-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, one possibility for the impaired p53 activities in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation was that p53S18A is mostly cytoplasmic. To test this notion, we analyzed the subcellular localization of p53 in MEFs after UV by immunochemical staining with anti-p53 antibody as described (3Chao C. Saito S. Kang J. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4967-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Our analysis indicated that p53 accumulated in the nucleus of p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 4B). In support of this finding, Western blotting analysis of p53 levels in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of MEFs also indicated that p53 was mostly nuclear in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (data not shown). Acetylation of p53 at the C terminus has been suggested to activate p53-dependent transcriptional activities by recruiting co-activators (27Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 28Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the p53 acetylation at the C terminus in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation as described (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In contrast to what was observed in p53S18A ES cells (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), acetylation of p53 at the C terminus was greatly reduced in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, providing a potential mechanism for the impaired p53 activities in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 4C). In Vivo DNA Binding to p53-dependent Promoters—Because p53 acetylation was significantly reduced in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, we assayed the in vivo binding of p53 to various p53-dependent promoters in wild type and p53S18A MEFs using chromatin immunoprecipitation assay as described (21Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This analysis indicated that the binding of p53 to these p53-dependent promoters was normal in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation (Fig. 5). Therefore, our findings support the notion that p53 acetylation at the C terminus is not required for its binding to p53-dependent promoters. In addition, the impaired p53 activities in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation are not due to impaired binding of p53 to p53-dependent promoters. Tumorigenesis in p53S18A Mice—Modulation of p53 activities appears to be required during early mouse embryogenesis (29Montes de Oca Luna R. Wagner D.S. Lozano G. Nature. 1995; 378: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). The genotype of the offspring from the intercrossing of heterozygous mutant mice showed a ratio of p53+/+:p53+/S18A: p53S18A of 86:132:88, close to the expected 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. Therefore, Ser18 phosphorylation is not required for the modulation of p53 activities during embryonic development. p53S18A mice were viable and matured into adulthood without any apparent developmental defects. Because some p53-dependent responses to DNA damage were impaired in p53S18A mice, these mice might be prone to cancer. Therefore, we monitored the onset of tumorigenesis in more than 55 pairs of p53S18A and littermate or age-matched wild type controls, which are presently between 1 and 2 years old. No apparent increase in spontaneous tumorigenesis was observed in p53S18A mice, suggesting that S18A mutation did not significantly affect p53 tumor suppression activities. It remains to be seen whether challenge of p53S18A mice with carcinogens will reveal enhanced tumor susceptibility or other hidden phenotypes. To investigate the functions of Ser18 phosphorylation in regulating p53 stability and activity, we analyzed the p53 responses to various types of DNA damage in a number of primary cell types, including MEFs, thymocytes, and ES cells (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that Ser18 phosphorylation plays important roles in regulating p53 stability in response to genotoxic stresses in different cell types. In p53S18A ES cells, we previously showed a delayed and reduced p53 induction after DNA damage (17Chao C. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11936-11941Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, here we show that the maximum levels of p53 induction induced by IR are similar in wild type and p53S18A thymocytes. In addition, higher than normal levels of p53 proteins accumulate in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation, probably because of weaker interaction between p53 and Mdm2. The difference in p53 stabilization and acetylation in p53S18A ES cells and fibroblasts after UV radiation suggests that regulation of p53 is atypical in ES cells, as suggested by Aladjem et al. (18Aladjem M.I. Spike B.T. Rodewald L.W. Hope T.J. Klemm M. Jaenisch R. Wahl G.M. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to study the effects of p53 phosphorylation site mutants in various primary cell types in order to draw conclusions on the in vivo function of the phosphorylation event. In this context, during our studies of the Ser23 phosphorylation site mutant, we analyzed the effects of S23A mutation on p53 stabilization in ES cells, MEFs, and thymocytes after DNA damage. Our results lead to the conclusion that the S23A mutation had no effect on p53 stabilization after DNA damage in all three primary cell types analyzed (25Wu Z. Earle J. Saito S. Anderson C.W. Appella E. Xu Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The normal or higher than normal levels of p53 induction in p53S18A MEFs and thymocytes after DNA damage highlight the importance of Ser18 phosphorylation in activating p53 functions. The findings that p53-dependent cell cycle G1 arrest and apoptosis are impaired in p53S18A cells after DNA damage indicate that Ser18 phosphorylation is important for the activation of p53 activities after these genotoxic stresses. The impaired p53 activities in p53S18A cells after DNA damage are not due to abnormal subcellular location of p53 after DNA damage, because p53 accumulated similarly in the nucleus of wild type and p53S18A cells after DNA damage. The impaired p53 activities are also not due to defective sequence-specific DNA-binding of p53S18A to p53-dependent promoters because p53 binds to a number of p53-dependent promoters normally in p53S18A cells after DNA damage. The greatly reduced acetylation of p53 at the C terminus in p53S18A MEFs after UV radiation might account for the impaired p53 activities, because these acetylation events were shown to be required to recruit transcriptional co-activators to p53-dependent promoters (27Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 28Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Our findings also indicate that p53 acetylation at the C terminus is not required to activate the sequence-specific DNA binding activities of p53, a conclusion consistent with several published studies (27Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 28Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Another novel finding from our studies is that the roles of Ser18 phosphorylation in regulating the transcription of p53 target genes appear to be promoter-specific. In this context, although the induction of many p53-dependent genes was impaired in p53S18A thymocytes after IR, induction of some p53-dependent genes was normal in p53S18A thymocytes after IR when compared with those in wild type thymocytes after IR. It is possible that the unaffected promoters, such as Mdm2 promoter, contain DNA-binding motifs bound by other transcriptional factors, which function redundantly with p53 in the recruitment of the transcriptional machinery. In addition, this promoter-specific role may sometimes depend on the cell types, for example, the induction of Mdm2 is enhanced in p53S18A thymocytes but reduced in p53S18A MEFs after DNA damage. The findings of the promoter-specific roles of Ser18 phosphorylation have several implications. As revealed by the analysis of p53-dependent responses to DNA damage, p53-dependent functions appear to be intermediately defective in p53S18A mice. However, no apparent increase in spontaneous tumorigenesis was observed in p53S18A mice. Therefore, it is possible that the unaffected p53-dependent gene products in p53S18A cells could still suppress tumorigenesis. A number of p53-dependent gene products are involved in apoptosis (30Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2726) Google Scholar). The promoter-specific roles of Ser18 could also help us to identify p53-dependent genes that are involved in IR-induced thymocyte apoptosis. Finally, most published studies on the impacts of p53 phosphorylation used only a few well known p53 target genes, such as p21 and Mdm2, as read-outs for p53 functions. However, because we now show that the role of phosphorylation could be promoter-specific, a more comprehensive group of p53 target genes should be investigated in future functional studies of p53 post-translational modifications.

However, the C57BL/6 murine strain does not display the large increase in circulating IgG and IgE antibodies found in human atopy and asthma. We found that commercial ovalbumin was contaminated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in amounts sufficient to fully activate endothelial cells in an in vitro assay of the first step of inflammation. Desensitization of TLR4 by LPS pretreatment suppressed the inflammatory effect of ovalbumin. The presence of LPS was occult, because it does not require serum presentation and, like the LPS of Salmonella minnesota, was not suppressed by polymyxin B.

Reconstitution of purified ovalbumin with S. minnesota LPS decreased lung inflammation, decreased changes in lung function, and suppressed anti-ovalbumin antibody production. We conclude endotoxin contaminates ovalbumin preparations and that endotoxin co-administration with the ovalbumin antigen creates a state of tolerance in a murine model of AHR. Co-exposure to endotoxin and antigen occurs in humans through organic dusts, so murine models of AHR may reflect the clinical situation, but models based on commercial ovalbumin do not accurately reflect the effect of protein antigen alone on animal physiology.

Increased levels of circulating IgE and IgG1 antibody and a propensity to allergic responses, atopy, are associated with the development of asthma. The natural history of the early phases of asthma remain ill-defined with a multitude of genes underlying predisposition toward this disease, variation in environmental exposure to triggers, access to medical care, and a lengthy interval before the development of symptoms all contributing to the complexity of the natural history of this disease. Animal models of AHR, where control of the timing of exposure to the initiating antigen, the use of a defined allergen trigger, and genetic manipulation are possible, are defining the roles of cytokines and inflammatory and immune cells (1Gleich G.J. Kita H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2101-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 2Drazen J.M. Takebayashi T. Long N.C. De Sanctis G.T. Shore S.A. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1999; 29: 37-47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Vasquez Y.R. Spina D. Respir. Res. 2000; 1: 82-86PubMed Google Scholar). The role of acute and chronic inflammation in altering the airway structure and function in animal models suggests that pro-inflammatory agents could contribute to the development of AHR (4O'Byrne P.M. Postma D.S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 159: S41-S63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A premier candidate in this category is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria. LPS is a potent and pleiotropic inflammatory agent that is a component of tobacco smoke (5Hasday J.D. Bascom R. Costa J.J. Fitzgerald T. Dubin W. Chest. 1999; 115: 829-835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), house dust (6Park J.H. Spiegelman D.L. Burge H.A. Gold D.R. Chew G.L. Milton D.K. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 1023-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and even extracts used in allergen testing (7Hunt L.W. Gleich G.J. Ohnishi T. Weiler D.A. Mansfield E.S. Kita H. Sur S. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 149: 1471-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Co-exposure to LPS or β (1→3) glucans along with particulate antigens is common in certain agricultural and industrial settings that produce organic dusts (8Rylander R. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2002; 8: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). Segmental installation of LPS into human lung results in an intense local inflammatory response characterized by a rapid neutrophilic influx (9Nightingale J.A. Rogers D.F. Hart L.A. Kharitonov S.A. Chung K.F. Barnes P.J. Thorax. 1998; 53: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10O'Grady N.P. Preas H.L. Pugin J. Fiuza C. Tropea M. Reda D. Banks S.M. Suffredini A.F. Am. J. Respir.

Tropea M. Reda D. Banks S.M. Suffredini A.F. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 1591-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This progression of cellular influx is mirrored, we find (11Albertine K.H. Wang L. Watanabe S. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L219-L233PubMed Google Scholar), in a murine model of AHR using ovalbumin sensitization and aerosol challenge. Why exposure to ovalbumin would mirror changes wrought by endotoxin is unknown. Ovalbumin has long been employed as a model immunogen as a single antigen to reduce the complexity of modeling AHR. Ovalbumin induces IgE accumulation in the serum of mice, although there is a significant variation in the amount and antibody class among strains (12Takeda K. Haczku A. Lee J.J. Irvin C.G. Gelfand E.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L394-L402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Wilder J.A. Collie D.D. Wilson B.S. Bice D.E. Lyons C.R. Lipscomb M.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 20: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and at least in BALB/c mice anti-ovalbumin IgE injection alone induces AHR (14Oshiba A. Hamelmann E. Takeda K. Bradley K.L. Loader J.E. Larsen G.L. Gelfand E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1398-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). We find, however, that commercial preparations of ovalbumin are highly contaminated with an inflammatory endotoxin that was not sequestered by polymyxin B treatment. We purified large amounts of ovalbumin to an endotoxin-free state and then examined how co-administration of an inflammatory and immunologic trigger, a likely scenario outside the laboratory setting, affects the development of AHR in a murine model of this disease. We report that co-administration of endotoxin with the ovalbumin immunogen suppresses changes in lung function, alters lung pathology, and suppresses immunoglobulin production. Reagents and Chemicals—Reagents and their sources were as follows: HBSS, BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD); human serum albumin, Baxter Healthcare (Glendale, CA); CD14-neutralizing monoclonal antibody MY4, Coulter Corp. (Miami, FL); TNFα and IL-1β were the products of R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN); ovalbumin, Salmonella minnesota LPS (R595), Escherichia coli LPS (0111:B4), polymyxin B sulfate, and all other chemicals unless otherwise noted were from Sigma (St Louis, MO). We examined four lots of ovalbumin with similar results; the data was collected using any of several batches of ovalbumin. N-Palmitoyl[S-2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-2(R,S)-propyl]-(R)-cysteinyl-seryl-lysyl-lysyl-lysyl-lysine (Pam3CSK4) was made from N-palmitoyl-[S-2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)-2(R,S)-propyl]-(R)-cysteine by the Chemical Synthesis core facility (University of Utah). Endothelial Cell Culture, Neutrophil Isolation, and Adhesion Assays—Primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells and [111In]oxine-labeled neutrophils used in adhesion assays were prepared as previously described (15Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 2235-2246Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), and use of these materials was approved by the University of Utah institutional review board. Values of 111In-neutrophils tightly bound to endothelial cells during a 5-min co-incubation represent the average and range of two samples for each condition from at least two similar experiments. Endotoxic Activity in Ovalbumin—Endotoxin-like contaminants in ovalbumin were visualized by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining with periodic acid activation as described previously (16Tsai C.M. Frasch C.E. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). Endotoxin was quantitated by a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000) purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Commercial and purified ovalbumin were tested for contamination with E. coli and S. minnesota LPS as standards. Commercial ovalbumin was diluted until the endotoxic activity entered the linear range of the standard, whereas purified ovalbumin was assayed in an undiluted form. We attempted to remove endotoxin from commercial ovalbumin (grade V) with endotoxin-affinity resin (END-X®, Associates of Cape Cod, Inc., Falmouth, MA), polymyxin B beads (Sigma), Extracti-Gel®D detergent-removing gel (Pierce, Rockford, IL) after incubating ovalbumin in 1% Nonidet P40 (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN). Commercial ovalbumin was also precipitated with 60% (NH4)2SO4, as described previously (17Fothergill L.A. Fothergill J.E. Biochem. J. 1970; 116: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). None of these procedures successfully removed the endotoxic material from the large amounts of ovalbumin needed for animal studies. Ovalbumin Purification from Chicken Egg White—Ovalbumin was prepared from chicken egg white as described previously (18Awade A.C. Moreau S. Molle D. Brule G. Maubois J.L. J. Chromatogr. A. 1994; 677: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Vachier M.C. Piot M. Awade A.C. J. Chromatogr. B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 664: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), except that all steps were performed under sterile conditions, all solutions used in the purification were filtered through a 0.22-μm sterile filter unit (Nalgen, Rochester, NY), and a few modifications were made to accommodate the large amounts (>100 g) of ovalbumin being purified. Chicken eggs were washed with antibacterial soap and aseptically punctured, and their white was transferred into autoclaved glassware with a sterile syringe and needle in a laminar flow hood. The white from six eggs was made to 500 ml with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g for 5 min, and 150-ml portions of the egg white solution were loaded onto a XK 50/60 Q-Sepharose Fast Flow fast-protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) at a flow rate of 7.5 ml/min. The column was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) (Buffer A) until A 280 returned to the baseline; the non-bound material was defined as fraction 1. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 100% buffer A to 50% buffer A and 50% buffer B (0.3 m NaCl in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)) and held at this mixture until ovalbumin finished eluting. This was fraction 2. The column was then stripped of remaining lipids and proteins by washing with 1 m NaOH, 70% EtOH, and 2 m NaCl, which was collected as fraction 3. The collected material was concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (molecular weight cutoff of 30,000, Millipore, Bedford, MA), the buffer was then substituted with endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma) and then reconcentrated until the pH stabilized between pH 7.2 and 7.4 (a minimum of three exchanges was required for this result). Protein concentration was determined by BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL), adjusted to 20 mg/ml, and stored at -70 °C until use. Ovalbumin Immunization, Airway Sensitization, Histology, and Plethysmography—Pathogen-free 3-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Simenson (Gilroy, CA). Upon delivery, the mice were kept in a pathogen-free animal facility and were given food and water ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Utah approved these animal experiments. Ovalbumin sensitization by injection and aerosolization, and collection of histologic specimens, was described previously (11Albertine K.H. Wang L. Watanabe S. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L219-L233PubMed Google Scholar). Penh estimation of lung function of sensitized mice was analyzed by whole body barometric plethysmography (Buxco Electronics, Inc., Sharon, CT) after methacholine challenge as described previously (11Albertine K.H. Wang L. Watanabe S. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L219-L233PubMed Google Scholar). Breathing patterns were assessed immediately after methacholine challenge using the variable Penh. Penh, or enhanced pause, is a unit-less calculated number that increases with bronchoconstriction (20Hamelmann E. Schwarze J. Takeda K. Oshiba A. Larsen G.L. Irvin C.G. Gelfand E.W. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1997; 156: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar), although we find it does not accurately reflect lung compliance (11Albertine K.H. Wang L. Watanabe S. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L219-L233PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-ovalbumin IgE ELISA—Mice were euthanized after plethysmography, their blood was collected by cardiac puncture, their serum was collected after centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min, and then stored at -70 °C. Specific IgE that bound ovalbumin antigen was quantitated by ELISA. High capacity EIA plates (Corning, Corning, NY) were coated with the cognate ovalbumin sample (50 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. The wells were washed thrice with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20, the plates were blocked with 2% human serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C, washed thrice with PBS/Tween 20 and probed for 2 h at 37 °C with biotin-conjugated goat anti-mouse (BD Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). Commercial Ovalbumin Is Inflammatory—Inflammation is initiated and localized by activation of endothelium (21McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. Weyrich A.S. Zimmerman G.A. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2003; 10: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). LPS stimulates endothelial cells via TLR4 receptors and induces expression of TLR2 receptors that respond to other endotoxins, including bacterial lipoproteins (22Faure E. Thomas L. Xu H. Medvedev A. Equils O. Arditi M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2018-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). We used human umbilical vein endothelial cells to probe for pro-inflammatory material by treating these cells for 4 h with buffer containing either human serum albumin or chicken ovalbumin before their state of activation was assessed by overlaying the monolayer with quiescent human PMN (23Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Prescott S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: S3-S5PubMed Google Scholar). Pyrogen-free human serum albumin did not induce endothelial cell-dependent PMN adhesion (Fig. 1), but even low concentrations of ovalbumin proved to be equivalent to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or E. coli LPS in stimulating endothelial cells. The response of endothelial cells to E. coli LPS is enhanced by the LPS-binding protein and soluble CD14 of serum, and serum similarly potentiated the response to low concentrations of ovalbumin. Higher concentrations of ovalbumin, however, did not require these accessory proteins. LPS-like Material Is Present in Commercial Ovalbumin, but Cannot Easily Be Suppressed by Polymyxin B—Resolution of commercial ovalbumin by SDS-PAGE and staining with a periodate-Schiff reaction showed the presence of material with the characteristics of LPS (not shown), so we assessed the endotoxic content of this ovalbumin with a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. We found that as little as 3 μg/ml ovalbumin contained about 0.5 enzyme unit/ml of endotoxic activity (Fig. 2A). This is a considerable amount of endotoxin, but because we do not know its identity, we cannot calculate its mass in the absence of an appropriate standard. However, extrapolating from the LPS of E. coli, we estimate that 1 mg of this batch of ovalbumin could be contaminated with as much as 10 μg of LPS. We tested whether the inflammatory material in commercial ovalbumin was the endotoxic contaminant we quantified in the Limulus assay. For this we pretreated, or not, each of the agonists with polymyxin B, an antibiotic that sequesters LPS. We found (Fig. 2B) that polymyxin B abolished the stimulation of endothelial cells by our positive control, E. coli LPS, whereas it was only partially effective at this concentration when mixed with even low concentrations of ovalbumin. In this experiment we used a submaximal amount of ovalbumin (3 μg/ml) to be sure that the ratio of polymyxin B to endotoxin was high, but even so polymyxin B was ineffective in neutralizing the endothelial cell agonist(s). LPS from S. minnesota Is Resistant to Polymyxin B Sequestration and Does Not Require CD14 Presentation—Chicken eggs can be contaminated with Salmonella, and the TLR4 receptor responds to the endotoxin of this bacteria as it does to that of E. coli (24Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5780-5787Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), so we determined whether Salmonella LPS differed from E. coli LPS as a target for polymyxin B sequestration. To test this, LPS from the two bacteria was pretreated with polymyxin B, and endothelial cell activation was assayed in serum-containing medium in the continued presence of polymyxin B. E. coli LPS became inflammatory in this assay at 100 ng/ml, and even at ten times this concentration its inflammatory effect was completely suppressed by polymyxin B (Fig. 3A). In contrast, Salmonella LPS (Fig. 3B) was considerably more potent than the LPS from E. coli in activating endothelial cells, and it was completely resistant to the effects of polymyxin B. Accordingly, we found (not shown) that columns containing immobilized polymyxin B were unable to remove the biologic activity from commercial ovalbumin. We determined whether the effect of Salmonella LPS on endothelial cells, like that of E. coli, was enhanced by the presence of serum and the soluble CD14 (sCD14) it contains (25Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 19-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). We preincubated endothelial cells in the presence or absence of serum, or with the blocking anti-CD14 monoclonal antibody MY4. The serum-supplied sCD14 was important at low concentrations of E. coli LPS, because MY4 completely inhibited endothelial cell activation at LPS concentrations of 100 ng/ml and below (Fig. 3C). Above this concentration, the response to E. coli LPS became both serum- and CD-14-independent. In contrast, activation of endothelial cells by Salmonella LPS was only partially dependent on serum and sCD14 and only at low LPS concentrations. The LPS of Salmonella (Fig. 3D) displays several of the characteristics of the biologically active material in purchased ovalbumin in that it is potent, largely independent of serum, and minimally affected by polymyxin B. LPS, but Not an Endotoxic Lipopeptide, Desensitized Endothelial Cells to Commercial Ovalbumin—We explored the nature of the inflammatory agent in commercial ovalbumin by distinguishing LPS from non-LPS endotoxins, because both prokaryotic proteins displaying a lipid-modified N-terminal cysteinyl residue and LPS are a potent endothelial cell agonists (26Wooten R.M. Modur V.R. McIntyre T.M. Weis J.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar, 27Neilsen P.O. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5231-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We selectively desensitized endothelial cells to either LPS or endotoxic proteins by a 24-h pre-exposure to Salmonella LPS or a synthetic lipid-modified endotoxic peptide Pam3CSK4. These agents activated the endothelial cell monolayers (not shown), but after 24 h most of the response had faded (note the slightly higher background in media/LPS and media/Pam3CSK4 compared with the open bar depicting media pretreated/media challenged monolayers in Fig. 4A). Challenge of these buffer- or endotoxin-pretreated cells with TNFα or IL-1β showed they still mounted an inflammatory response to unrelated inflammatory agents (Fig. 4A). These cells were, however, selectively unable to respond to a subsequent exposure to the desensitizing agonist. Thus cells pre-exposed to Salmonella LPS did not respond to a subsequent exposure to this LPS, but did respond to Pam3CSK4. The converse also was true: Pam3CSK4 desensitized only to a second exposure to Pam3CSK4 and not to a subsequent LPS challenge. With the controls established validating this approach, we desensitized endothelial cells for 24 h with purified ovalbumin as a stringent control, or with Salmonella LPS or Pam3CSK4, and then challenged these cells with purified or commercial ovalbumin for 4 h. Cells preincubated with purified ovalbumin and then challenged with purified ovalbumin were not activated (open bars), whereas those preincubated with Salmonella LPS or Pam3CSK4 showed a low level of residual activation as before (left bars of Fig. 4B). Cells preincubated with purified ovalbumin and then challenged with commercial ovalbumin still displayed a strong inflammatory response (compare the open bars in Fig. 4B). In contrast, cells desensitized to Salmonella LPS (the dark bar) showed a complete lack of a response to commercial ovalbumin. Conversely, endothelial cells desensitized to Pam3CSK4 fully responded to a subsequent challenge with commercial ovalbumin. Commercial ovalbumin, then, must contain an endotoxin that is recognized in the same way as Salmonella LPS. Contamination of Commercial Ovalbumin Accounts for Its Inflammatory Effects—We purified large amounts of ovalbumin from fresh eggs to find that the purified ovalbumin, in marked contrast to the starting material, was without effect on endothelial cell monolayers (Fig. 5). The presence of serum did not increase the sensitivity of the cells to purified ovalbumin, which it did for low, and not high, amounts of commercial ovalbumin. We added Salmonella LPS to the purified ovalbumin and found that this combination behaved as higher concentrations of commercial ovalbumin: there was high basal activity that was insensitive to the presence of serum, polymyxin B, or anti-CD14 MY4 antibody. We noted that ovalbumin enhanced the effect of Salmonella LPS over free LPS (compare the unfilled bars of the rightmost two groups of columns), but we have no direct evidence that ovalbumin aids in the presentation of LPS to endothelial cells. Ovalbumin Contamination Affects Development of Murine AHR—Commercial ovalbumin has been widely used as an antigen in murine models of airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). We determined whether purified ovalbumin, in the absence of a concomitant inflammatory signal from contaminating endotoxin, induced AHR, and whether the addition of Salmonella LPS to this endotoxin-free material recapitulated the results obtained with commercial ovalbumin. Mice were sensitized on day 0 with either endotoxin-free PBS, purified ovalbumin, ovalbumin reconstituted with Salmonella LPS, commercial ovalbumin, or Salmonella LPS alone. These mice were then exposed to these same agents in an aerosolized form on day 8 and then every day for 9 days starting on day 14 as described previously (11Albertine K.H. Wang L. Watanabe S. Marathe G.K. Zimmerman G.A. McIntyre T.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: L219-L233PubMed Google Scholar, 28Brusselle G.G. Kips J.C. Tavernier J.H. van der Heyden J.G. Cuvelier C.A. Pauwels R.A. Bluethmann H. Clin. Exp. Allergy. 1994; 24: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). To detect AHR, the breathing patterns of these mice were analyzed on days 15, 18, and 22 of the protocol in awake unrestrained animals by plethysmography, to calculate the Penh variable, just after each mouse was challenged with methacholine. Mice challenged with commercial ovalbumin developed small changes, about 2-fold, in their airway reactivity (Fig. 6) by day 22 when challenged with minimally effective dose of methacholine (15 mg/ml). We tested purified, endotoxin-free ovalbumin in this model, but unexpectedly found that this proved to be significantly better at sensitizing the mice than the commercial material. By example, as early as day 18 mice sensitized with the endotoxin-free ovalbumin responded to the methacholine challenge, and this response was greatly increased by day 22 of the model. Salmonella LPS alone, when used at a concentration giving a response equivalent to commercial ovalbumin in the Limulus amebocyte assay, did not differ in its effects from the vehicle control. We then combined this amount of Salmonella LPS with purified ovalbumin to find that this combination suppressed the effect of the purified protein in sensitizing the mice to the methacholine challenge. The combination of Salmonella LPS and endotoxin-free ovalbumin therefore behaved much as the purchased protein preparation. We conclude that endotoxin can be a powerful negative modulator in the development of AHR in this model. Lung Inflammation and Structural Changes Induced by Purified and Commercial Ovalbumin—We examined lung sections from mice subjected to the AHR model to find that the sections from PBS-exposed control mice were unremarkable (Fig. 7A). In contrast, sections from mice sensitized and challenged with either purified or commercial ovalbumin showed distinct, and non-equivalent, changes over time. Lung consolidation was evident in animals receiving purified ovalbumin (note the overall increase in tissue staining), but this was not a prominent feature of mice receiving commercial ovalbumin. Enlargement (Fig. 7B) of the areas outlined in Fig. 7A confirm the impression of consolidation and cellularity. Among the notable changes were perivascular infiltrates, thickened septa around airways and thickened alveolar walls, and the presence of alveolar edema, as shown by the pink staining material, in the lung sections of mice receiving purified ovalbumin. In contrast to the histology of animals challenged with purified ovalbumin, the alveoli of mice receiving commercial ovalbumin were clearly dilated. The alveolar destruction and dilatation caused by commercial ovalbumin is similar to the emphysematous-like lesions found after long term intratracheal exposure of mice to LPS (29Vernooy J.H. Dentener M.A. van Suylen R.J. Buurman W.A. Wouters E.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Supplementation of purified ovalbumin with Salmonella LPS suppressed, but not completely, formation of perivascular infiltrates and alveolar thickening. The addition of Salmonella LPS to the purified ovalbumin also caused some alveolar dilatation, but, at least at this concentration, did not completely recapitulate the changes caused by exposure to commercial ovalbumin. Circulating IgE Levels Differ after Immunization with Commercial or Purified Ovalbumin—We determined whether LPS contamination suppressed the immune response to ovalbumin, or just the development of AHR, and so quantified the levels of IgE in serum from each group of mice. We found that mice sensitized to commercial ovalbumin displayed a minor increase in circulating total (Fig. 8A) or ovalbumin-specific (Fig. 8B) IgE levels, but that mice treated with purified ovalbumin demonstrated a large increase in IgE over time. We also found that addition of Salmonella LPS to the purified material suppressed the animal's immunologic response to the antigen and inhibited IgE accumulation. Murine models of AHR and other immunologic disorders, where genetic manipulation is possible, promise to be invaluable in understanding complicated disease. The use of a single immunogen and a defined time of sensitization in the murine model eliminate two key variables in human disease. Here we show that the most commonly employed immunogen in models of murine AHR is sufficiently contaminated with an endotoxin to affect the inflammatory system. We anticipated that removing endotoxin from the immunogen used in the initial intraperitoneal injection and in the subsequent aerosol exposures would suppress development of AHR, because we would have removed an adjuvant from the immunogen and because chronic LPS exposure causes persistent lung inflammation (29Vernooy J.H. Dentener M.A. van Suylen R.J. Buurman W.A. Wouters E.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Instead, we saw that the effect of this endotoxic material was to suppress the development of AHR, lung consolidation, and IgE accumulation. Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is an initial step in the inflammatory response to endotoxin, and so we used these cells to probe for bioactivity. We found endothelial cells to be fully activated by a few micrograms of commercial ovalbumin, where we estimate, based on the Limulus amebocyte assay, that as much as 1% of the mass may be endotoxin. The response of the LAL assay varies with the nature of the LPS being analyzed, so we lack an appropriate standard to accurately define its mass in ovalbumin. A recent publication (30Strohmeier G.R. Walsh J.H. Klings E.S. Farber H.W. Cruikshank W.W. Center D.M. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 2063-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) also detected endotoxic activity in ovalbumin solutions, although at levels less than we measured, that did not affect the development of lung disease in BALB/c mice. Also in BALB/c mice, addition of low levels of LPS induces an IgE-promoting Th2-type response, whereas higher amounts of LPS induce a Th1 response (31Eisenbarth S.C. Piggott D.A. Huleatt J.W. Visintin I. Herrick C.A. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 1645-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (989) Google Scholar). This study, unlike most murine models of AHR, did not use alum as an adjuvant, so this may account for the difference we find in a model using C57BL/6 mice, but there also are large differences in the response to ovalbumin among inbred strains of mice (32Brewer J.P. Kisselgof A.B. Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Among these differences is the very low production of ovalbumin-specific IgE antibody by C57BL/6 mice relative to BALB/c mice (32Brewer J.P. Kisselgof A.B. Martin T.R. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 160: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), although we show here that the presence of contaminating endotoxin in ovalbumin significantly suppresses the production of these antibodies in C57BL/6 mice. Endotoxin in commercial ovalbumin did not behave like E. coli LPS in that it was resistant to sequestration by polymyxin B and insensitive to the presence of soluble CD14 and LPS-binding protein in serum. The LPS of the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella also proved to be resistant to polymyxin B inhibition (33Cavaillon J.M. Haeffner-Cavaillon N. Mol. Immunol. 1986; 23: 965-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) (see above) and also does not require presentation by CD14 or LPS-binding protein. The principle in commercial ovalbumin responsible for endothelial cell activation seemed to act through the same receptor, likely TLR4 (34Lien E. Means T.K. Heine H. Yoshimura A. Kusumoto S. Fukase K. Fenton M.J. Oikawa M. Qureshi N. Monks B. Finberg R.W. Ingalls R.R. Golenbock D.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), as Salmonella LPS, because selective desensitization to this LPS prevented cellular activation by commercial ovalbumin. We conclude that an endotoxin contaminates commercial ovalbumin, and its nature makes it less susceptible to suppression by methods that are effective in blocking the effects of E. coli LPS. This property makes standard approaches to detecting or suppressing endotoxic activity by chromatography over immobilized polymyxin B ineffective. A recent editorial “Eat Dirt—The Hygiene Hypothesis and Allergic Diseases” (35Weiss S.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 930-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) encapsulates the idea that the gradual increase in the prevalence of autoimmune disease stems from a gradual decrease in early childhood infections obtained through better public health measures. A study relating children's exposure to endotoxin with hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization supports the conclusion that a subject's environmental exposure to endotoxin might have a crucial role in developing tolerance to ubiquitous natural allergens (36Braun-Fahrlander C. Riedler J. Herz U. Eder W. Waser M. Grize L. Maisch S. Carr D. Gerlach F. Bufe A. Lauener R.P. Schierl R. Renz H. Nowak D. von Mutius E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 347: 869-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar). Endotoxins contaminate organic dusts (8Rylander R. J. Endotoxin. Res. 2002; 8: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar) and subchronic inhalation of LPS in a murine model causes persistent airway disease in endotoxin-responsive mice (37Brass D.M. Savov J.D. Gavett S.H. Haykal-Coates N. Schwartz D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: L755-L761Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other approaches have suggested that early exposure to endotoxin independently increases the risk of developing wheeze (38Park J.H. Gold D.R. Spiegelman D.L. Burge H.A. Milton D.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and suggest that chronic inhalation of endotoxin may contribute to the development of asthma, although the timing of endotoxin exposure and of course genotype affect how endotoxins affect the response to allergens (39Schwartz D.A. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 163: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Asthma is a particularly complex autoimmune disorder, and unraveling its natural history in animal models with mixed antigen and adjuvant is problematic. Egg white proteins physically bind pathogenic bacteria to prevent upper urinary tract infections (40Johnson J.R. Swanson J.L. Neill M.A. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 578-583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) during egg formation, and indeed we found that even fresh eggs sterilely prepared contained sufficient endotoxic material to fully activate endothelial cells. Purification of ovalbumin was the only effective means we found to circumvent the effect of endotoxic contamination: Extracti-Gel®D beads, precipitation by SDS (41Hegg P.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 579: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), sequestration with immobilized polymyxin B, and phenol extraction of LPS (42Manthey C.L. Vogel S.N. J. Endotoxin Res. 1994; 1: 84-91Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) were ineffective or did not provide soluble antigen (not shown). We conclude that Salmonella-like material in commercial ovalbumin is a potent, serum-independent, and polymyxin B-resistant inflammatory agent that causes immune tolerance in C57BL/6 mice. Such contaminants complicate lessons derived from murine models of airway hyper-reactivity that use unpurified ovalbumin as the immunogen.

https://openalex.org/W1999516481,"Components of ORC (the origin recognition complex) are highly conserved among eukaryotes and are thought to play an essential role in the initiation of DNA replication. The level of the largest subunit of human ORC (ORC1) during the cell cycle was studied in several human cell lines with a specific antibody. In all cell lines, ORC1 levels oscillate: ORC1 starts to accumulate in mid-G1 phase, reaches a peak at the G1/S boundary, and decreases to a basal level in S phase. In contrast, the levels of other ORC subunits (ORCs 2–5) remain constant throughout the cell cycle. The oscillation of ORC1, or the ORC1 cycle, also occurs in cells expressing ORC1 ectopically from a constitutive promoter. Furthermore, the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocks the decrease in ORC1, suggesting that the ORC1 cycle is mainly due to 26 S proteasome-dependent degradation. Arrest of the cell cycle in early S phase by hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, or thymidine treatment is associated with basal levels of ORC1, indicating that ORC1 proteolysis starts in early S phase and is independent of S phase progression. These observations indicate that the ORC1 cycle in human cells is highly linked with cell cycle progression, allowing the initiation of replication to be coordinated with the cell cycle and preventing origins from refiring.

The replication of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotes is limited to once per cell division cycle. This control appears to be achieved mainly by the regulation of replication origins so that they fire only once per cell cycle.

The sequential assembly of these factors on origin-ORC complexes precedes initiation, as has been shown in yeast and Xenopus systems.

These associations provide an important mechanism that 1) ensures that replication origins fire at precise times and 2) prevents re-initiation.Budding yeast ORC is a static complex that is maintained at a constant level and remains bound to origins throughout the cell cycle (4Diffley J.F.

Thus, MCM loading in yeast is mainly regulated by other factors such as cell cycle-regulated Cdc6 or CDK kinase activities (7Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev.

It is also known that the phosphorylation status of ORC subunits correlates with the timing of pre-RC formation, suggesting a role for ORC phosphorylation in MCM loading (16Nguyen V.Q. Co C. Li J.J.

Similar phosphorylation of ORC subunits was found in a Xenopus egg extract system, suggesting a conserved mechanism for the regulation of ORC functions (17Romanowski P. Marr J. Madine M.A. Rowles A.

Recent studies have elucidated possible mechanisms for the regulation of ORC activity in mammals. In human and hamster cells, ORC1, the largest subunit, is ubiquitinated in S phase (19Mendez J.

In human cells, ORC1 is poly-ubiquitinated by the SCFskp2 ubiquitin ligase complex and degraded through the 26 S proteasome pathway (19Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cellular content of ORC1 is greatly reduced in S phase (19Mendez J.

In hamster cells, ORC1 is only mono-ubiquitinated and may be regulated by a mechanism other than degradation (21Li C.J. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Indeed, the cellular ORC1 level remains constant in hamster cells (21Li C.J. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell.

These data suggest that the activity of mammalian ORC is regulated by ubiquitination of ORC1, but ubiquitinated ORC1 has different fates in different species or cell lines.To elucidate the mechanisms that regulate ORC activity in mammals, and especially in humans, we determined the levels of ORC subunits in several human cell lines throughout the cell cycle. From systematic studies in which we synchronized these cells by a variety of methods, we conclude that ORC1 exhibits cell cycle-dependent oscillation, a phenomenon we have termed the ORC1 cycle. The ORC1 cycle ensures the dynamic assembly of ORC and MCM on chromatin in G1 phase, which may correspond to the formation of the pre-RC in human cells, as demonstrated in an accompanying paper (24Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Synchronization—Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). To impose cell cycle arrest by the double-thymidine block method, HeLa S3 cells were incubated in the presence of 2.5 mm thymidine for two periods of 24 h with an intervening incubation of 12 h in the absence of thymidine. For M phase arrest, cells were subjected to the double-thymidine block procedure and then cultured in the presence of 150 ng/ml TN16 (WAKO, Japan) for 12 h. Synchronous growth following arrest was achieved by two washes with PBS and subsequent culturing without reagents. Telomerase-immortalized human retina pigment epithelial cells (TERT-RPE1 cells, Invitrogen) were synchronized by serum starvation. TERT-PRE1 cells (50% confluent) were incubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without FCS for 84–96 h and then released from starvation by the addition of 10% FCS. Hydroxyurea (HU) was included at 2.5 mm. Synchronized growth was monitored by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) of propidium iodide-stained cells (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), by immunoblot analysis of cyclin E and cyclin A levels, and by 5-bromo-2′-deoxy-uridine (BrdUrd) incorporation. Incorporated BrdUrd was detected using the 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine Labeling and Detection Kit I (Roche Applied Science, Germany). Briefly, cells were labeled with BrdUrd for 10 min and detected using a monoclonal antibody against BrdUrd and a fluorescein-conjugated second antibody, as specified by the manufacturer. Cells were also stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) as described previously (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The fluorescent signals were visualized with a Leica DMRBE and captured with Photometrics PXL.Expression of ORC1-FLAG in Human 293 Cells—The ORC1 cDNA with a C-terminal fusion to the 3xFLAG sequence (5′-GACTACAAAGACCATGACGGTGATTATAAAGATCATGACATCGATTACAAGGATGACGATGACAAG-3′) and an N-terminal fusion to an artificial Kozak sequence (5′-GCCGCCGCC-3′) was inserted downstream of the CMV promoter of pcDNA3.1zeo (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid (pcDNA-ORC1-FLAG) was transfected into 293 cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science, Germany), and clones expressing ORC1-FLAG were obtained by selection on zeocin. A clone (1C2) expressing a level of ORC1-FLAG equivalent to the endogenous level of ORC1 was chosen for the experiments shown in Fig. 4C.Preparation of Cell Extracts—For whole cell extracts, cells plated on dishes were washed three times with PBS, suspended in modified CSK buffer (0.1% TX-100mCSK: 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Pipes (pH 7.0), 300 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Triton), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin), and mixed with an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (100 mm Tris-Cl (pH 6.8), 200 mm dithiothreitol, 4% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 20% glycerol). Trichloroacetic acid fixation was done as described previously (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol.

The peptides were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli by standard methods. To obtain monospecific antibodies, the crude antisera were affinity-purified with antigens. Anti-human ORC2 and MCM7 monoclonal antibodies, 3B7 and 4B4, were purchased from MBL (Japan), and anti-human ORC3 and ORC4 antisera were kindly provided by Dr. A. Dutta (26Thome K.C. Dhar S.K.

Immunoblotting with these antibodies was done as described previously (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol.

The coverslips were incubated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Triton for 10 min, washed three times with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), incubated with #209 in TBS-T containing 10% FCS overnight at 4 °C, washed three times with TBS-T and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated secondary antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., reactive with rabbit IgG) at room temperature for 2 h. After three washes with TBS-T followed by one PBS wash, cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and washed three times with PBS. Samples were stained with the anti-BrdUrd antibody in the same way. Fluorescent images were collected using a Leica DMRBE microscope coupled to a Photometrics PXL capturing system (Fig. 2), or by using an Olympus confocal microscope (Fluoview FV500; Fig. 3). To count BrdUrd- and ORC1-positive cells (Fig. 2), threshold levels were set just above the cytoplasmic background (Iplab Spectrum P 3.1.2c, Scanalytics Inc.), and cells showing nuclear signals were scored as positive.Fig. 2Quantitative analysis of ORC subunits in synchronously growing HeLa S3 released from M phase arrest. HeLa S3 cells were released from M phase arrest by TN16 treatment and harvested at the indicated time points. FACS profiles (upper left panels, first row) and staining patterns with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, second row) or antibodies to ORC1 (#209, third row) and BrdUrd (fourth row) are shown.

Typical results for G1, early S, and late S phases are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)RESULTSDetection of Human ORC1 from Human Cell Lysates with Anti-ORC1 Antibodies—We previously characterized ORC1 in human cells using the monoclonal antibody 3A2A, which was raised against a human ORC1 peptide (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this study, we prepared a new polyclonal anti-ORC1 antibody, #209, which detected a 100-kDa polypeptide band, as shown by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1), and precipitated proteins of the same size from human cell extracts (24Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have confirmed that the 100-kDa polypeptide that reacts with #209 is ORC1 by two lines of evidence. First, the amino acid sequences of 16 tryptic peptides produced from the immunoprecipitated band matched those of human ORC1, as shown by LC/MS/MS analysis (24Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Second, the 100-kDa band shown in Fig. 1 disappeared after cells were subjected to RNA interference with human ORC1-specific small interference RNAs (24Ohta S. Tatsumi Y. Fujita M. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41535-41540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, the new antibody is highly specific to human ORC1. On the other hand, although our previous antibody, 3A2A, also reacted specifically with 100-kDa polypeptide(s) in human cells, including ORC1, LC/MS/MS analysis showed that it also cross-reacted with the 100-kDa polypyrimidine tract binding protein-associated splicing factor (data not shown). The broader recognition specificity of 3A2A may affect our previous conclusions concerning human ORC1 (25Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, we re-examined human ORC1 with the new antibody and confirmed that most of our original results are valid, except that we now estimate the ORC1 content of HeLa S3 cells to be 1.5 × 104 molecules/cell (data not shown), and the ORC1 level oscillates in a cell cycle-dependent manner as described bellow. Hereafter, we used the #209 antibody to characterize ORC1 in human cells.Fig. 1Detection of cellular ORC1 protein with the #209 polyclonal antibody. Proteins in a whole cell lysate prepared from 1 × 105 HeLa S3 cells were separated in a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to immunoblot analysis with the #209 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Cell Cycle-dependent Oscillation of ORC1 in HeLa S3 Cells Synchronized by M Phase Arrest—As described under “Experimental Procedures” and above for the #209 antibody, we obtained antibodies specific for ORCs 1–5 that could be used to detect their respective targets in HeLa S3 cell lysates. We analyzed synchronously growing HeLa S3 cells released from a metaphase arrest imposed by treatment with TN16. Cell cycle progression was monitored by counting BrdUrd-positive cells and by analyzing the single-parameter FACS patterns. These profiles indicated that S phase started between 6 and 9 h after release from arrest (Fig. 2). Whole-cell extracts were prepared from cells withdrawn at indicated time points and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies against ORC subunits, cyclins A and E. The latter two proteins were used as representative markers for cell cycle transitions (29Dulic V. Lees E. Reed S.I. Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). It is notable that the cyclin E level correlated with the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells and that the cyclin A level increased in S phase. ORC1 was at a basal level from metaphase to early G1 (0–3 h), started to increase between 3 and 6 h, peaked at 9 h (G1/S) at a level 10-fold higher than the basal level, and then decreased from S to G2 phase (Fig. 2). In contrast, the levels of the ORC2–5 subunits remained constant over time. The oscillation of ORC1 observed by immunoblotting was confirmed by counting #209-positive cells. The ORC1-positive proportion of cells increased during G1 up to the G1/S boundary (3–9 h) and decreased during S phase (9–15 h). These two results clearly indicate that the increase in ORC1 abundance occurred slightly earlier than the increases in the cyclin E level and in the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells, which both peaked at 15 h (Fig. 2).The ORC1 Level Decreases before S Phase in Individual Cells—More precise observations of cells stained with the #209 antibody by confocal microscopy showed that ORC1 appeared as punctate signals in HeLa S3 nuclei, suggesting that it associates with nuclear structures (Fig. 3). The number of dots in a cell was correlated with its position in the cell cycle by simultaneously staining for BrdUrd. As indicated in Fig. 3, more than 500 ORC1-specific dots were dispersed throughout the nucleus in G1 phase cells, but this number decreased in parallel with cell cycle progression (Fig. 3, early S and late S). These data strongly suggest that the decrease in ORC1 abundance that precedes S phase is a result of changes in protein levels in individual cells. Interestingly, ORC1 signals did not overlap with BrdUrd signals, suggesting that ORC1 is not present at sites of DNA synthesis.Cell Cycle-dependent Oscillation of ORC1 Observed under Various Conditions—Next, we asked whether the oscillation of ORC1 in HeLa S3 cells described above is cell type-specific. We tested two human cell lines, 293 (an embryonic kidney cell line transformed with adenovirus type 5, Fig. 4A) and HEp-2 (a larynx carcinoma cell line, Fig. 4B). Synchronization experiments demonstrated that HEp-2 cells enter S phase with a schedule similar to that of HeLa S3 cells, but 293 cells enter S phase slightly earlier, as indicated by FACS analysis and the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells. For both cell lines, ORC1-specific oscillations were observed, and the ORC1 level peaked earlier than the increase in the frequency of BrdUrd positive cells, although ORCs 2–5 remained at constant levels throughout the cell cycle, as seen for HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Next we tested whether oscillation could be observed for FLAG-tagged ORC1 ectopically expressed from a CMV-promoter in 293 cells. For a cell line expressing FLAG-tagged ORC1 at a level similar to that of endogenous ORC1 (data not shown), we observed oscillation in the levels of the FLAG-tagged protein as that of endogenous ORC1 (Fig. 4C).We further tested a different synchronization method to confirm ORC1 oscillation. HeLa S3, 293, and HEp-2 cells were arrested in early S phase for 24 h by the double-thymidine block method, and cellular protein contents were studied as described above after release from arrest (time 0) (Fig. 5, A–C). In all cases, ORC1 was at a basal level at time 0 and remained there until the beginning of BrdUrd incorporation. As was seen in M phase synchronization experiments, the ORC1 peak appeared earlier than the increase in the frequency of BrdUrd-positive cells. Again, the levels of ORC2–5 were constant.Fig. 5Quantitative analysis of ORC subunits in synchronously growing human cells released from early S phase arrest and comparison of lysis methods. HeLa S3 (A), 293 (B), and HEp-2 (C) cells were released from an early S phase arrest imposed by the double-thymidine block method and harvested at the indicated time points. FACS profiles (top panels) and the ratios of BrdUrd-positive cell numbers to total DAPI-stained cells (graphs at right) are shown. Quantitative immunoblot analysis of ORC subunits was performed with whole cell lysates as shown in Fig. 2 (lower left panels). The relative band intensities of ORC1 are shown as in Fig. 2 in the graphs at right. D, asynchronously growing cells (Asyn) or cells arrested by the thymidine block method for 24 h (Thy) were first harvested in Triton buffer and then mixed with SDS (Triton), lysed directly with SDS (SDS), or first fixed with trichloroacetic acid and then lysed with SDS (TCA). Quantitative immunoblot analysis of ORC1 and ORC2 was performed with lysates prepared from 1 × 105 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We used a relatively mild lysis method in the preceding experiments, by first suspending cells in Triton buffer and subsequently mixing them with SDS buffer. Thus, it is formally possible that the decrease in ORC1 might be due simply to degradation during sample preparation, because ORC1 has been reported to be very unstable (21Li C.J. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 105-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 23Okuno Y. McNairn A.J. den Elzen N. Pines J. Gilbert D.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4263-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To address this concern, we tested more direct extraction conditions: 1) cells in culture dishes were directly lysed with SDS buffer, and 2) cells were first fixed with trichloroacetic acid and then lysed with SDS buffer (Fig. 5D). In both cases, the extent of degradation of ORC1 in extracts prepared from thymidine-blocked cells was the same as in extracts prepared by our original method, indicating that the levels of ORC1 observed in our cell lysates reflect the levels of ORC1 in human cells.Further studies done with TERT-RPE1 cells (telomerase-immortalized human retina pigment epithelial cells) arrested in G0 by serum starvation for 4 days showed that the level of ORC1 was also low in these cells (Fig. 6). When the cells were stimulated with serum, the level of ORC1 started to increase at 12 h, peaked at 18 h, and decreased in the following S phase (18–27 h, Fig. 6). This result indicates that the ORC1 cycle also occurs in synchronized non-cancer cells. Therefore, irrespective of cell types, antibodies for detection and synchronization methods, the ORC1 cycle can be observed in human cells.Fig. 6Oscillation of ORC1 in synchronously growing TERT-PRE1 cells released from serum starvation. Serum-starved TERT-PRE1 cells were released from arrest by the addition of 10% FCS at time 0 and harvested at the indicated time points.

Selective activation of α6β1 integrin in microvascular endothelial cells by the anti-β1 antibody TS2/16 therefore accounts for their adhesion responses to thrombospondins and explains the distinct functions of α4β1 and α6β1 integrins as thrombospondin receptors in microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells.

Integrins play a major role in mediating interactions between cells and their extracellular matrix environment. In addition to providing physical anchoring of cells, engagement of integrins transmits signals into cells that regulate their survival and behavior (reviewed in Ref. 1Hynes R.O.

TSP1 modulates cell behavior by altering cell adhesion, motility, proliferation, survival, gene expression, and differentiation. Some cellular responses to TSP1 are mediated by non-integrin receptors (5Brown E.J. Frazier W.A.

To date, interactions of TSP1 with αvβ3, α3β1, α4β1, and α5β1 have been demonstrated (9Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J.

Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but the recognition site identified for α3β1 is not conserved in TSP2 (13Krutzsch H.C. Choe B.

One of the best characterized biological activities of TSP1 and TSP2 is to modulate angiogenesis. Inhibition of endothelial cell chemotaxis is mediated by the TSP1 receptor CD36 (14Dawson D.W.

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans and CD47 may also contribute to the anti-angiogenic activities of TSP1 (15Vogel T. Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Blake D.A. Hartman J. Mendelovitz S. Panet A. Roberts D.D. J.

We previous reported that α3β1 mediates a pro-angiogenic activity of the N-terminal pentraxin module of TSP1 (18Chandrasekaran L. He C.-Z. Al-Barazi H.O. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Roberts D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This integrin is constitutively expressed on venous and microvascular endothelial cells, but its ability to bind TSP1 is regulated by cell-cell signaling involving VE-cadherin (18Chandrasekaran L.

Because β1-dependent interactions of TSP1 or TSP2 with endothelial cells could not be completely inhibited by α3β1 antagonists, we examined the role of additional β1 integrins expressed on endothelial cells as TSP receptors. 2M.

This effort revealed that a second β1 integrin, α4β1, selectively functions as a TSP1 and TSP2 receptor in large vessel endothelial cells. However, microvascular cells are refractory to α4β1 antagonists. We have therefore examined the role of additional β1 integrins as TSP receptors in microvascular cells and report here that α6β1 is a major integrin receptor for TSP1 and TSP2 that mediates adhesion and chemotaxis of microvascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, we identify a specific sequence in the N-terminal module of TSP1 that mediates this interaction and demonstrate that this sequence antagonizes interactions of α6β1 with its well characterized ligand laminin-1. Cell Culture—Human dermal microvascular endothelial (HDMVE) cells and human lung microvascular endothelial (HMVE-L) cells (Cambrex Bio Science Inc., Walkersville, MD) were grown under the conditions specified by the manufacturer. Adult iliac vein endothelial cells (AG10773A; NIA Repository, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were grown on flasks coated with 0.1% gelatin in medium 199 containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mm glutamine, 30 μg/ml endothelial cell mitogen (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA), and 30 μg/ml heparin.

Residue numbers refer to the mature sequence of secreted TSP1. The forward and reverse mutation-inducing primer sequences were 5′-GAGTGGTCTTTCCGCGCCAGGGCCAGCAGCGTG-3′ and 5′-GAGTGGTCTTTCCGCGCCAGGGCCAGCAGCGTG-3′, respectively. After growth on LB broth/ampicillin plates at 30 °C, the mutated plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue cells for isolation, transformed into Rosetta cells (Novagen) for protein expression, and grown to log phase at 37 °C on LB broth plus carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml). Inclusion bodies were isolated, and the mutant recombinant protein was purified as described previously for the wild-type recombinant protein (15Vogel T. Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Blake D.A. Hartman J.

Recombinant S7D-VCAM-1 (soluble 7-domain vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, residues 1–674) was prepared as described previously (12Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D.

Antibodies and Reagents—The β1-activating antibody TS2/16 (23Hemler M.E. Sanchez-Madrid F. Flotte T.J. Krensky A.M. Burakoff S.J. Bhan A.K. Springer T.A. Strominger J.L. J.

The function-blocking rat anti-human α6 monoclonal antibody GoH3 was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). The α3β1-blocking antibody P1B5 was from Sigma. The fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse antibody used in flow cytometry was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). The α4β1 integrin function inhibitor (4-((2-methylphenyl)aminocarbonyl)aminophenyl)acetyl-LDVP (24Lin K. Ateeq H.S. Hsiung S.H. Chong L.T. Zimmerman C.N. Castro A. Lee W.C. Hammond C.E. Kalkunte S.

(Gaithersburg, MD). Cell Adhesion Assay—Laminin-1 (5 μg/ml), TSP1 (40 μg/ml), S7DVCAM-1 (5 μg/ml), and NoC1 and NoC2 (30 μg/ml) in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and TSP1-(1–175) (30 μg/ml) in 20 mm NaHCO3 (pH 8.0) were absorbed (as triplicates of 8-μl drops) onto polystyrene dishes (Falcon 1008) by overnight incubation at 4 °C. The drops were aspirated, and the plates were blocked by incubation with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in DPBS for 30 min. Cells were dissociated using 2 mm EDTA in DPBS and resuspended in medium 199 containing 0.1% BSA at 5 × 106 cells/ml for HUVE cells or in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm HEPES for HT-1080 cells. For activating β1 integrins, antibody TS2/16 was added at 5–10 μg/ml. For inhibition studies, the anti-α6 antibody GoH3 at 5–10 μg/ml or peptide LALERKDHSG at 200 μm was added. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °Cin5%CO2, the dishes were washed three times with DPBS and fixed for 30 min with 1% glutaraldehyde in DPBS. After staining with Diff-Quik solution II (Dade Behring, New Castle, DE), cells were counted microscopically in 0.25-mm2 fields for each triplicate analysis. Only cells with a diameter >25 μm were considered spread, and cells with a diameter <25 μm were considered attached. α6 Integrin Expression—Semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR was used to determine the expression levels of α6β1 integrin on endothelial cells. Total RNA was isolated from HUVE and HDMVE cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using 2 μg of total RNA. The enzyme was inactivated at 70 °C for 15 min. The cDNA was amplified using platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) and specific primer pairs for α6 integrin (sense, AAGTCTCAGTTTCTTGCTTGGG; and antisense, TTCTTTGTTGACCACCCTCC). Amplification was carried out for two cycles of 1 min at 95 °C and 4 min at 55 °C, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 2.5 min at 55 °C, and 10 min at 70 °C. Flow Cytometry Analysis—HUVE and HDMVE cells were washed with DPBS containing 0.2% BSA and incubated with Puck's saline containing 0.2% EDTA and 10% FBS at 37 °C for 6 min. Cells were dislodged and resuspended in a large volume of Puck's saline/EDTA solution, centrifuged, resuspended in DPBS containing 0.2% BSA at a density of 6 × 106 cells/ml, and stored on ice. Cells (1 × 106/labeling reaction) were incubated with 2 μg of antibody TS2/16 as a control or with 2 μg of antibody GoH3 for 1 h. Cells were washed twice with DPBS and 0.2% EDTA and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. Labeled cells were washed again and fixed with 300 μl of 1% formaldehyde in DPBS. Flow cytometry acquisition was performed using a BD Biosciences flow cytometer. Immunoprecipitation Analysis—HUVE or HDMVE cells grown in 10-cm dishes were dislodged with 2 mm EDTA, centrifuged, and resuspended (1 × 106 cells/ml) in a 1 mg/ml solution of EZ-Link Sulfo-NHSLC-Biotin (Pierce) at room temperature for 1 h. After washing with DPBS, the cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm NaF supplemented with 10 μg/ml each antipain, pepstatin A, chymostatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the lysate was precleared by centrifugation. Equal volumes with equal protein concentrations were immunoprecipitated using the anti-α6 antibody GoH3 prebound to anti-mouse IgG agarose (Sigma). The immune complexes were washed six times with Tris-buffered saline, diluted with sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol, heated, and fractionated on precast SDS gels (Bio-Rad). After transfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, the proteins were detected using horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and visualized using chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Chemotaxis—HDMVE cells at passages 5–8 were used 2–3 days after passage. Modified Boyden chambers and 8-μm pore polycarbonate membranes (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) coated with 100 μg/ml gelatin in 0.1% aqueous acetic acid were used. Cells were dislodged with 2 mm EDTA and allowed to recover for 30 min suspended in complete medium. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in medium 199 containing 0.1% BSA and added (56 μl) to the upper chamber in the absence or presence of TSP1 (30 μg/ml), NoC1 or NoC2 (20 μg/ml), or blocking antibodies. Wells in the lower chamber contained 28 μl of assay medium alone or with TSP1 (30 μg/ml) or NoC1 or NoC2 (20 μg/ml). Cells were allowed to migrate for 6 h. The membranes were fixed and stained. Migrated cells were counted microscopically. α6β1 Integrin Mediates Microvascular Endothelial Cell Adhesion to TSP1—Residues 175–242 of the N-terminal module of TSP1 contain a recognition site for α3β1 (13Krutzsch H.C. Choe B. Sipes J.M. Guo N. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24080-24086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) that is partially responsible for adhesion of microvascular endothelial cells to TSP1 (18Chandrasekaran L. He C.-Z. Al-Barazi H.O. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Roberts D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, TSP1-(1–175) was only severalfold less active than intact TSP1 in mediating adhesion of antibody TS2/16-activated HDMVE cells (Fig. 1A). This region contains an α4β1-binding site that mediates adhesion of large vessel endothelial cells, 2M. J. Calzada, L. Zhou, J. M. Sipes, J. Zhang, H. C. Krutzsch, M. L. Iruela-Arispe, D. S. Annis, D. F. Mosher, and D. D. Roberts, submitted for publication. but an α4β1 antagonist did not significantly inhibit adhesion of HDMVE cells to TSP1-(1–175) or intact TSP1 (Fig. 1B). Because adhesion to this region was inhibited by a β1-blocking antibody (data not shown), we used function-blocking antibodies specific for other α subunits to define its specificity. An antibody against α9β1 integrin was inactive (data not shown), but an α6-blocking antibody reproducibly decreased adhesion of HDMVE cells to TSP1 and TSP1-(1–175) (Fig. 1B). Inhibition of adhesion to TSP1-(1–175) by antibody GoH3 was comparable to that obtained using the known α6β1 ligand laminin-1 (Fig. 1B). α6β1 also played a significant role in adhesion of unstimulated HDMVE cells to TSP1 and TSP1-(1–175) (Fig. 1C). Antibody GoH3 inhibited adhesion of unstimulated cells by 50 ± 17% to intact TSP1 and by 52 ± 4% to TSP1-(1–175). Activation using antibody TS2/16 increased adhesion to TSP1-(1–175) by 5-fold, and this adhesion remained 56 ± 3% inhibitable by antibody GoH3. Therefore, TSP1 differs from the activation-independent α6β1 ligand Cyr61 (25Leu S.-J. Liu Y. Chen N. Chen C.-C. Lam S.C.-T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33801-33808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) in that its interaction with the integrin is partially activation-dependent. Inhibition by the anti-α6β1 antibody was reproducibly observed using several independent isolates of HDMVE cells, but not using HUVE cells (Fig. 2A). An α4β1 antagonist reproducibly inhibited adhesion of antibody TS2/16-activated HUVE cells to TSP1-(1–175), but not to laminin-1 (Fig. 2A). HUVE cell adhesion to this known α6β1 ligand was only slightly inhibited by the anti-α6β1 antibody (Fig. 2A), suggesting that α6β1 integrin is either absent or not functional in these cells. To determine whether the distinct behavior of HDMVE and HUVE cells was unique to endothelial cells from these anatomical sites, we tested microvascular and large vessel cells from different organs. Adhesion of iliac vein endothelial (AG10773A) cells was also insensitive to the anti-α6β1 antibody (Fig. 2B), whereas HMVE-L cell adhesion was inhibited by this antibody (Fig. 2C). Therefore, the selective expression or function of α6β1 as a TSP1 receptor may be a general characteristic of microvascular endothelial cells. α6β1 Integrin Also Recognizes TSP2—Adhesion of HDMVE cells to the trimeric N-terminal regions of both TSP1 (NoC1) and TSP2 (NoC2) was β1-dependent (Fig. 3A), but the anti-α6 antibody was a more effective inhibitor of HDMVE cell adhesion to NoC2 than to NoC1 (Fig. 3B). The lesser sensitivity for NoC1 may be explained by the presence of an α3β1-binding site in NoC1, but not in NoC2. However, α6β1 appears to be the major β1 integrin in HDMVE cells that recognizes TSP2. α6β1 Integrin Expression Levels Are Similar in Large and Small Vessel Cells—The levels of α6β1 expression were measured to examine why microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells differed in their utilization of α6β1 as a TSP receptor. α6 mRNA was expressed at similar levels in HUVE and HDMVE cells based on reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 4A). Cell-surface expression of α6 and β1 subunits assessed by flow cytometry did not differ between HUVE and HDMVE cells (Fig. 4B). However, analysis of the total expression levels by immunoprecipitation using the same anti-α6 antibody revealed some differences in the α6 subunit (Fig. 4C). On an underexposed blot (Fig. 4C, upper panel), more intact 120-kDa α6 subunit was reproducibly detected in HDMVE cells than in HUVE cells. By densitometry, this represented a 1.6-fold difference in α6 subunit between HDMVE and HUVE cells. After a longer exposure (Fig. 4C, lower panel), we could also detect differences in the pattern of processed α6 subunits or integrin-associated proteins. In addition to the intact α6 subunit, HUVE cell immunoprecipitates contained 70- and 43-kDa proteins. The apparent masses of these proteins are consistent with the unreduced and reduced molecular masses reported for a structural variant of the α6 integrin called α6 parvus (26Davis T.L. Rabinovitz I. Futscher B.W. Schnolzer M. Burger F. Liu Y. Kulesz-Martin M. Cress A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26099-26106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the gel was run under reducing conditions, it is possible that the 70-kDa band corresponds to partially unreduced α6 parvus. In the α6 immunoprecipitate from HDMVE cells, these bands were less abundant relative to the intact 120-kDa α6 subunit, but an additional unknown protein was also detected. Likewise, a slight difference in the expression levels of this integrin was also found in HMVE-L and AG10773A cells (Fig. 4D). These minor differences may not be sufficient to account for the differential function of α6β1 in these cells. Activation States of α6β1 Integrin Differ in HUVE and HDMVE Cells—The differences in expression of α6β1 integrin in HUVE and HDMVE cells are probably insufficient to account for the differences in its function. Alternatively, the activating antibody TS2/16 may not stimulate α6β1 integrin equally in microvascular and large vessel endothelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we compared the activity of other integrin activation agonists in these cells (Fig. 5). In contrast to antibody TS2/16, MnCl2 and lipopolysaccharide stimulated anti-α6β1 antibody-inhibitable adhesion of HUVE cells to TSP1 and laminin-1. Notably, we previously found that lipopolysaccharide does not activate α3β1 integrin in endothelial cells (18Chandrasekaran L. He C.-Z. Al-Barazi H.O. Krutzsch H.C. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Roberts D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2885-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that this agonist is selective for activating α6β1 integrin. We also used antibody TS2/16 to activate HUVE cells exposed to conditioned medium from HDMVE cells to determine whether the latter cells release growth factors that facilitate α6β1 activation. However, the α6β1-blocking antibody had no effect under these conditions (Fig. 5). We consistently observed less inhibition of adhesion to TSP1 and laminin substrates by the α6β1-blocking antibody following MnCl2 or lipopolysaccharide addition in HUVE cells compared with HDMVE cells (data not shown). These results indicate that α6β1 is more easily activated in microvascular than in large vessel endothelial cells. Identification of an α6β1 -Binding Sequence in the N-terminal Module of TSP1—The smallest portions of TSP1 and TSP2 that supported α6β1-dependent adhesion contain amino acids 1–175 of mature TSP1 and amino acids 1–359 of TSP2, suggesting that the α6β1-binding site is localized in the N-terminal modules of both proteins. The N-terminal modules of TSP1 and TSP2 are evolutionarily related to the G modules of laminin α subunits (27Beckmann G. Hanke J. Bork P. Reich J.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Given that the laminin G modules contain an α6β1-binding site (28Hall D.E. Reichardt L.F. Crowley E. Holley B. Moezzi H. Sonnenberg A. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2175-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 29Sonnenberg A. Linders C.J. Modderman P.W. Damsky C.H. Aumailley M. Timpl R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2145-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), we considered that the position of the α6β1-binding sequence may be conserved in TSP1. Therefore, two synthetic peptides were synthesized that aligned with a proposed α6β1-binding sequence from laminin-1, peptide AG-32 (30Nomizu M. Kim W.H. Yamamura K. Utani A. Song S.Y. Otaka A. Roller P.P. Kleinman H.K. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20583-20590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, neither LFVQEDRAQLYI (TSP1-(140–151)) nor ATGQWKSITLF (TSP1-(131–141)) inhibited HDMVE cell adhesion to TSP1 or NoC2 (Fig. 6) (data not shown). Because integrin recognition sites often require an Asp or Glu residue (2Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12809-12812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our second approach to identify a sequence recognized by α6β1 integrin in TSP1 and TSP2 was to search for conserved Asp or Glu residues in the N-terminal modules of the known TSP1 and TSP2 sequences. Such conserved acidic residues are present at positions 14, 35, 90, 111, 126, 127, 145, and 162 of TSP1. We tested synthetic peptides containing six of the conserved acidic residues that were identified on this basis. Control peptides for each had Ala substituted for the conserved Asp or Glu residues. The conserved Asp/Glu residue at position 162 was previously identified as an α4β1-binding site in TSP1 and TSP2 (12Li Z. Calzada M. Sipes J. Cashel J. Krutzsch H. Annis D. Mosher D. Roberts D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and did not affect α6β1-mediated adhesion. Synthetic peptides containing acidic residues 35 (ELTGAARKGSGRRLVKGPD), 126 and 127 (VSVEEA), 111 (SNGKAGTLDLS), and 145 (LFVQEDRAQLYI) were inactive (Fig. 6). However, a peptide containing Glu90 (LALERKDHSG) strongly inhibited HDMVE cell adhesion to NoC2 (Fig. 7A), TSP1-(1–175) (Fig. 7B), and the E8 fragment of laminin-1 (Fig. 6). This inhibition was dose-dependent and specific in that control peptide LALARKDHSG was inactive (Fig. 7, A and B). To confirm that the peptide antagonized α6β1, we tested HT-1080 cells, which exhibit α6β1-dependent adhesion to the laminin-1 E8 fragment (31Aumailley M. Timpl R. Sonnenberg A. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 188: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HT-1080 cell adhesion to NoC2 (Fig. 7C) and to the E8 fragment of laminin-1 (Fig. 7D), which contains its α6β1-binding site (29Sonnenberg A. Linders C.J. Modderman P.W. Damsky C.H. Aumailley M.

https://openalex.org/W2013714072,"Inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) by Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation is critical for normal cell cycle progression and is a converging event for several cell cycle checkpoints. In this study, we compared the relative contribution of inhibitory phosphorylation for cyclin A/B1-CDC2 and cyclin A/E-CDK2 complexes. We found that inhibitory phosphorylation plays a major role in the regulation of CDC2 but only a minor role for CDK2 during the unperturbed cell cycle of HeLa cells. The relative importance of inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 and CDK2 may reflect their distinct cellular functions. Despite this, expression of nonphosphorylation mutants of both CDC2 and CDK2 triggered unscheduled histone H3 phosphorylation early in the cell cycle and was cytotoxic. DNA damage by a radiomimetic drug or replication block by hydroxyurea stimulated a buildup of cyclin B1 but was accompanied by an increase of inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2. After DNA damage and replication block, all cyclin-CDK pairs that control S phase and mitosis were to different degrees inhibited by phosphorylation. Ectopic expression of nonphosphorylated CDC2 stimulated DNA replication, histone H3 phosphorylation, and cell division even after DNA damage. Similarly, a nonphosphorylation mutant of CDK2, but not CDK4, disrupted the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. Finally, CDC25A, CDC25B, a dominantnegative CHK1, but not CDC25C or a dominant-negative WEE1, stimulated histone H3 phosphorylation after DNA damage.

Cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 1The abbreviations used are: CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase; ADR, adriamycin; CMP, camptothecin; Dox, doxycycline; HU, hydroxyurea; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; BrdUrd, bromode-oxyuridine; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. are key regulators of the eukaryotic cell cycle. In mammalian cells, different cyclin-CDK complexes are involved in regulating different cell cycle transitions: cyclin D-CDK4/6 for G1 progression, cyclin E-CDK2 for the G1-S transition, cyclin A-CDK2 for S phase progression, and cyclin A/B-CDC2 (CDK1) for entry into M phase (reviewed in Refs. 1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar and 2Poon R.Y.C. Bertino J.R. Encyclopedia of Cancer. Academic Press, San Diego2002: 393-404Google Scholar). The kinase activity of CDK is tightly regulated by an intricate system of phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions. By definition, the activation of CDKs is dependent on a cyclin subunit. Activation of CDKs requires binding to a cyclin partner and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue (Thr161 in CDC2). Inhibition of some CDKs is carried out by phosphorylation of residues close to the catalytic site (Thr14 and Tyr15 in CDC2), and binding to protein inhibitors of the p21 CIP1 / WAF1 and p16 INK4A families. The regulation of the archetype CDK, CDC2, remains the best understood. CDC2 exists as an unphosphorylated and inactive monomer during G1. During S phase, cyclin B1 accumulates and forms an inactive complex with Thr14-, Tyr15-, and Thr161-phosphorylated CDC2. This inactive cyclin B1-CDC2 complex continues to accumulate during G2 until it is activated by dephosphorylation of Thr14 and Tyr15 during mitosis. CDC2 is inactivated when cyclin B1 is degraded by APC/C as the cell exit mitosis. The phosphorylation of CDC2 returns to the ground state in G1 when Thr161 is dephosphorylated. For mammalian CDC2, Thr14 and Tyr15 are phosphorylated by WEE1 and MYT1, and dephosphorylated by members of the CDC25 family. WEE1 is a dual specificity protein kinase that phosphorylates Tyr15 but not Thr14 (3Parker L.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1992; 257: 1955-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The activity of human WEE1 is suppressed during mitosis, when it is transiently hyperphosphorylated and degraded (4Watanabe N. Broome M. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1878-1891Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 5Parker L.L. Sylvestre P.J. Byrnes M.J. Liu F. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9638-9642Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6McGowan C.H. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2166-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism of how WEE1 is regulated is not completely understood, data from yeast and other organisms suggest that WEE1 is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of its N-terminal noncatalytic region, possibly by cyclin B1-CDC2 in a feedback loop. MYT1 is an endoplasmic reticulum- and Golgi complex-bound protein kinase that can phosphorylate both the Thr14 and Tyr15 residues of CDC2, but has a stronger preference for Thr14 (7Booher R.N. Holman P.S. Fattaey A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22300-22306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Liu F. Stanton J.J. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 571-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). MYT1 activity decreases during M phase, coinciding with the phosphorylation of its C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain of MYT1 also has a separate inhibitory function for CDC2, as it can bind cyclin B1-CDC2 and prevent its entry into the nucleus (9Wells N.J. Watanabe N. Tokusumi T. Jiang W. Verdecia M.A. Hunter T. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3361-3371PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liu F. Rothblum-Oviatt C. Ryan C.E. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5113-5123Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thr14 and Tyr15 are dephosphorylated by the dual specificity phosphatase CDC25. Mammalian cells contain three isoforms of CDC25 (A, B, and C), which are believed to function at discrete periods during the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 11Nilsson I. Hoffmann I. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 2000; 4: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). CDC25C is the major phosphatase that activates CDC2 for entry into mitosis, CDC25B may have roles in both G2 and S phase, and CDC25A functions in G1. Recently, CDC25A has also been implicated for the control of mitosis (12Mailand N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Groth A. Mann M. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Active cyclin B1-CDC2 phosphorylates the N-terminal region of CDC25C and increases its activity (13Strausfeld U. Fernandez A. Capony J.P. Girard F. Lautredou N. Derancourt J. Labbe J.C. Lamb N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5989-6000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylates CDC25A and stabilizes the phosphatase (12Mailand N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Groth A. Mann M. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These autocatalytic mechanisms lead to a rapid and complete activation of all the cyclin B1-CDC2 as cells enter mitosis. For cyclin B-CDC2, the involvement of Thr14/Tyr15-dependent regulation appears to be well conserved through evolution. The notable exception is budding yeast, in which phosphorylation of Cdc28p (the CDC2 homolog) is dispensable for normal cell cycle progression (14Amon A. Surana U. Muroff I. Nasmyth K. Nature. 1992; 355: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15Sorger P.K. Murray A.W. Nature. 1992; 355: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The involvement of inhibitory phosphorylation in the regulation of other cyclin-CDK pairs during normal cell cycle is not as well defined. Cyclin A-CDC2 is activated and destroyed slightly ahead of cyclin B1-CDC2. Cyclin A-CDC2 is not regulated by inhibitory phosphorylation in Xenopus embryonic cell cycle (16Clarke P.R. Leiss D. Pagano M. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1751-1761Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), but is inhibited by phosphorylation in Drosophila (17Sprenger F. Yakubovich N. O'Farrell P.H. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 488-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Vertebrate CDK2 is phosphorylated on Thr14 and Tyr15 during S phase and G2, and can be activated by CDC25 (18Goldstone S. Pavey S. Forrest A. Sinnamon J. Gabrielli B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 921-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Gu Y. Rosenblatt J. Morgan D.O. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3995-4005Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 20Sebastian B. Kakizuka A. Hunter T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3521-3524Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 21Gabrielli B.G. Lee M.S. Walker D.H. Piwnica-Worms H. Maller J.L. J. Biol.

Whereas inhibitory phosphorylation is crucial for the regulation of CDC2 in vivo, the case for CDK2 is not as clear. It has been shown that inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 plays no essential role in Drosophila development (23Lane M.E. Elend M. Heidmann D. Herr A. Marzodko S. Herzig A. Lehner C.F. Genetics. 2000; 155: 233-244PubMed Google Scholar). For vertebrate cells, ectopic expression of a nonphosphorylatable CDK2 in HeLa cells induces premature chromosome condensation (24Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), suggesting that inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 may play a role in normal cell cycle control. Similarly, G1-S transition is blocked by microinjection of antibodies against CDC25A (25Jinno S. Suto K. Nagata A. Igarashi M. Kanaoka Y. Nojima H. Okayama H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1549-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 26Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and is accelerated by ectopic expression of CDC25A (22Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, whether exogenous CDC25A reduces inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2 is a contentious issue (22Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 27Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Proper control of cell cycle progression requires several checkpoint controls, which among other things, regulate the activities of CDKs to ensure that each stage of the cell cycle is completed before the next stage is initiated. Deregulation of checkpoints may allow cell cycle progression to become insensitive to genotoxic stress and give rise to genomic instability. The G2 DNA damage checkpoint exerts its effects mainly through the inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 (reviewed in Ref. 28Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Upon DNA damage, ATM/ATR phosphorylates and activates CHK1/CHK2, which in turn phosphorylates CDC25C on Ser216. This either inactivates the phosphatase activity of CDC25C directly, or indirectly through the creation of a 14-3-3 binding site (29Lopez-Girona A. Kanoh J. Russell P. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 50-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Blasina A. de Weyer I.V. Laus M.C. Luyten W.H. Parker A.E. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This tips the balance of Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation toward CDC2 inactivation. Destruction of CDC25A (12Mailand N. Podtelejnikov A.V. Groth A. Mann M. Bartek J. Lukas J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5911-5920Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) and activation of WEE1 by CHK1 and 14-3-3 (31Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) may also contribute to Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation of CDC2 after DNA damage. In agreement with an essential role of inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint, expression of a nonphosphorylatable CDC2 impairs the irradiation-induced G2 delay and CDC2 inactivation (24Jin P. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 963-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 32Blasina A. Paegle E.S. McGowan C.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is believed that the checkpoint that responses to a block in replication is executed through similar mechanisms as the G2 DNA damage checkpoints (reviewed in Ref. 33Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, CDC2 is phosphorylated on Thr14/Tyr15 during replication block (34Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Moreover, expression of a nonphosphorylatable CDC2 renders cells highly sensitive to killing by replication block (32Blasina A. Paegle E.S. McGowan C.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The G1 DNA damage checkpoint inhibits cyclin-CDK2 through mechanisms comprised of p53 and the CDK inhibitor p21 CIP1/WAF1 (reviewed in Ref. 35Prives C. Cell. 1998; 95: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). A parallel pathway that monitors DNA damage during G1 and S phase involves inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK2. Several DNA damage-induced protein kinases, including ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2, phosphorylate and promote the destruction of CDC25A (36Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar, 37Sorensen C.S. Syljuasen R.G. Falck J. Schroeder T. Ronnstrand L. Khanna K.K. Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Lukas J. Cancer Cell. 2003; 3: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). This prevents the dephosphorylation of Thr14/Tyr15 in CDK2 and impairs both G1-S transition and S phase progression. CDK2 participates in the phosphorylation of pRb and releases the transcription factor E2F (reviewed in Ref. 38Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2245-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). E2F controls the expression of a number of genes required for S phase. CDK2 also phosphorylates components of the prereplication complex. This serves two purposes: one involves the loading of CDC45 and activation of the origin by phosphorylation of MCM proteins; the other involves prevention of re-replication by phosphorylation of CDC6 (39Coverley D. Pelizon C. Trewick S. Laskey R.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1929-1938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Saha P. Chen J. Thome K.C. Lawlis S.J. Hou Z.H. Hendricks M. Parvin J.D. Dutta A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2758-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Petersen B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK4 also plays a role in the G1 DNA damage checkpoint. CDK4 is phosphorylated on Tyr17 (the Tyr15 equivalent site) after UV-induced G1 checkpoint, and ectopic expression of a nonphosphorylatable CDK4 abolished the checkpoint (42Terada Y. Tatsuka M. Jinno S. Okayama H. Nature. 1995; 376: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Recent data have placed some uncertainties on the functions of inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 in the DNA damage and replication checkpoints. Inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2 in response to replication block is abolished in mammalian cells without ATR (34Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). However, the replication checkpoint remains intact in ATR knockout cells, suggesting that incomplete DNA replication can prevent M phase entry independently of Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation of CDC2 (34Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In this study, we compared the relative contribution of inhibitory phosphorylation for cyclin A/B1-CDC2 and cyclin A/E-CDK2 complexes during unperturbed cell cycle, DNA damage, and replication block. We found that inhibitory phosphorylation plays a critical role in the regulation of CDC2, but only a minor role for CDK2 during unperturbed cell cycle. However, expression of nonphosphorylation mutants of both CDC2 and CDK2 is cytotoxic. We further investigated the relative contribution of inhibitory phosphorylation of CDC2, CDK2, CDK4, as well as regulators of Thr14/Tyr15 (CDC25 family and WEE1) in the DNA damage checkpoints.

Chinese hamster ovary cells were obtained from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). E1A-immortalized wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts and p53–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts were gifts from Dr. Richard Woo (Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) calf serum (for HtTA1) or fetal bovine serum (for H1299) in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with a calcium phosphate precipitation method (48Ausubel F. Brent R. Kingston R. Moore D. Seidman J. Smith J. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

For mitotic block synchronization, cells were first blocked with thymidine for 24 h before being released into medium containing nocodazole for 9 h. The cells were then washed and seeded into fresh medium without nocodazole. Unless stated otherwise, cells were treated with the following reagents at the indicated final concentration: adriamycin (ADR) (0.02 μg/ml), camptothecin (CMP) (700 nm), Dox (1 μg/ml), G418 (100 μg/ml), hydroxyurea (HU) (1.5 mm), nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml), puromycin (1 μg/ml), and thymidine (2 mm). Stable inducible cell lines were produced by co-transfection of FLAG-tagged CDKs in pUHD-P1/PUR and pLINX (a gift from Tony Hunter, The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) into H1299. Two days after transfection, the cells were then selected in medium supplemented with puromycin, G418, and Dox. After about 3 weeks of selection, individual colonies were isolated and expanded. The expression of FLAG-tagged proteins was analyzed after growing cells in medium in the presence or absence of Dox for 24 h. The established cell lines were propagated in the presence of Dox but without other antibiotic selection. Cell Growth Analysis—Cell growth was measured by seeding ∼104 cells/60-mm plate and recording an image from the same randomly selected areas (within 2-mm diameter circles fixed at the bottom of the plate) every 24 h using a light microscope and a cool CCD camera. The number of attached cells was counted and the population doubling time was estimated by plotting the log of cell number against time. For clonogenic survival assays, 500 cells were seeded per 60-mm plate either in the presence or absence of Dox. Dox was supplemented into the medium at the indicated time and fresh medium (with or without Dox) was replenished every 3 days. After 2 weeks, colonies were fixed with methanol:acetic acid (2:1, v/v) and visualized by staining with 2% (w/v) crystal violet in 20% methanol. For β-galactosidase staining, cells were fixed in 0.05% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in PBS at 25 °C for 10 min. The cells were then washed four times with PBS, and stained with a solution containing 20 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 20 mm K3Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) in PBS at 37 °C for 16 h. Flow Cytometry—Flow cytometry analysis after propidium iodide staining were performed as described (51Siu W.Y. Arooz T. Poon R.Y.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 250: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For double analysis of cell cycle and histone H3 phosphorylation, cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed in ice-cold 80% EtOH, and washed twice with PBST (PBS supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin). The cell pellet was resuspended in the residue buffer and incubated with 1 μg of primary antibody at 25 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed twice with PBST, resuspended in the residue buffer, and incubated with 2.5 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) at 25 °C for 30 min. After washing once in PBST, the cells were processed for propidium iodide staining and two-dimensional flow cytometry analysis. In some experiments, transfected cells were distinguished from non-transfected cells by co-transfection of a membrane-targeted GFP reporter (52Jiang W. Hunter T. BioTechniques. 1998; 24 (352, 354): 349-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) (a gift from Wai Jiang and Tony Hunter, The Salk Institute). Cells were harvested by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry as usual, and the DNA content of GFP-positive and GFP-negative cells was analyzed. BrdUrd Incorporation—Cells were incubated in medium supplemented with 10 μm BrdUrd for 2 h. The cells were then harvested and fixed with 80% ethanol. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were treated with 2 m HCl at 25 °C for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS followed by once with PBST. The cell pellet was resuspended in residue buffer and incubated with 2 μl of anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) at 25 °C for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with PBST and incubated with 5 μl of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibodies (DAKO) at 25 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed with PBST, and processed for propidium iodide staining and two-dimensional flow cytometry analysis. Phosphatase Treatment and Histone H1 Kinase Assays—Expression of recombinant GST-CDC25A and GST-CDC25B proteins in bacteria and purification with GSH-agarose chromatography were as described (49Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of GST fusion proteins in 10 μl of phosphatase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 25 °C for 30 min. After washing in kinase buffer (80 mm Na β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgOAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol), the histone H1 kinase activity was assayed as described previously (46Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was quantified with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies and Immunological Methods—Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as described (49Poon R.Y.C. Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1197-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy were performed as described previously (53Yam C.H. Siu W.Y. Arooz T. Chiu C.H. Lau A. Wang X.Q. Poon R.Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5075-5078PubMed Google Scholar), except that the cells were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 min onto the coverslips just before fixing.

Dual acylation is important for attachment to liquid-ordered microdomains or lipid rafts. Accordingly, Src is excluded from lipid rafts in fibroblasts. Evidence of partial genetic redundancy between Src and Fyn for brain-specific targets suggests that these two kinases may occupy overlapping subcellular locations. Neuronal Src (NSrc), an alternative isoform of Src with a 6-amino acid insert in the Src homology 3 domain, is highly expressed in neurons. We investigated whether this structural difference in NSrc allows it to associate with lipid rafts. We found that perinatal mouse brains express predominantly NSrc, which is partly (10–20%) in a lipid raft fraction from brain but not fibroblasts. The association of Src with brain lipid rafts does not depend on the NSrc insert but depends on the amino-terminal myristoylation signal. A crude lipid fraction from brain promotes NSrc entry into rafts in vitro. Moreover, lipid raft-localized NSrc is more catalytically active than NSrc from the soluble fraction, possibly because raft localization alters access to other tyrosine kinases and phosphatases.

The Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (SFKs) 1The abbreviations used are: SFK(s), Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases; cSrc, normal splice form of Src; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MAb, monoclonal antibody; NSrc, neuronal Src; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SH2 and SH3 domains, Src homology 2 and 3 domains, respectively; TBS, Tris-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: SFK(s), Src family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases; cSrc, normal splice form of Src; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; MAb, monoclonal antibody; NSrc, neuronal Src; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; SH2 and SH3 domains, Src homology 2 and 3 domains, respectively; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. is broadly expressed and involved in many cell surface receptor-mediated signaling cascades (for review, see Refs. 1Brown M.T.

Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 176-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Elucidation of normal SFK function has been difficult because most stimuli that activate SFKs also activate non-SFK tyrosine kinases. Moreover, redundancy within the SFK family has confounded attributing a specific signaling process exclusively to one kinase. Gene disruption studies have sometimes revealed exclusive functions for specific SFKs in certain cell types, Src in osteoclasts (3Lowe C. Yoneda T. Boyce B.F. Chen H. Mundy G.R. Soriano P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and Lck in T cells (4Molina T. Kishihara K. Siderovski D. van Ewijk W. Narendran A. Timms E. Wakeham A.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1845-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The subcellular localizations of SFKs have provided valuable clues toward understanding their functions. Src in focal adhesions plays a key role in integrin-dependent signaling events that affect cellular adhesion and motility (6Lipfert L. Haimovich B. Schaller M.D. Cobb B.S. Parsons J.T. Brugge J.S. J.

Localization of SFKs to various subcellular locations can be affected by protein-protein interactions involving their SH3 or SH2 domains (7Kaplan K.B. Bibbins K.B. Swedlow J.R. Arnaud M. Morgan D.O.

However, lipid-lipid interactions involving amino-terminal acyl groups on SFKs are the primary mechanism for membrane localization of SFKs (11Sefton B.M. Trowbridge I.S. Cooper J.A. Scolnick E.M.

Enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and phosphoinositides, these membrane microdomains contain proteins involved in vesicular trafficking and signal transduction. Lipid rafts often contain structural proteins such as caveolins and flotillins, but some do not (20Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol.

It is thought that rafts function in signaling by concentrating signaling components, as seen during immunoglobulin E-triggered allergic responses in mast cells and basophils (27Field K.A. Holowka D. Baird B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9201-9205Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 28Sheets E.D. Holowka D. Baird B. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 95-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Conversely, exclusion of molecules from rafts may also regulate signal transduction. For instance, T cell receptor engagement leads to raft aggregation, thus facilitating colocalization of Lck, LAT, and T cell receptor while excluding CD45 phosphatase, hence enhancing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (29Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 447-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Although most SFKs are double acylated, with myristate on Gly-2 and palmitate on Cys-3, Src, Blk, and the p61 isoform of Hck are only myristoylated (13Koegl M. Zlatkine P. Ley S.C. Courtneidge S.A.

Dual acylation is important for the inclusion of SFKs such as Fyn, Lyn, Lck, and Hck p59 into lipid rafts of fibroblasts and leukocytes (30Robbins S.M. Quintrell N.A. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3507-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 31Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1159-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Introducing a palmitoylation signal into wild-type Src causes relocalization to rafts (31Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Dietzen D.J. Kwong J. Link D.C. Lublin D.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The exclusion of Src from rafts implies that it may not encounter substrates that are localized in or traffic through lipid rafts, and hence Src may be performing distinct functions from raft-localized SFKs. This notion is supported by the finding that EphrinA5 tyrosine phosphorylation in brain lipid rafts is reduced when Fyn is absent, even though Src is present (35Davy A. Gale N.W. Murray E.W. Klinghoffer R.A. Soriano P. Feuerstein C. Robbins S.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 3125-3135Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). On the other hand, some other brain proteins are phosphorylated by either Src or Fyn. For example, Src and Fyn are redundant for tyrosine phosphorylation of p190 RhoGAP in the brain (36Brouns M.R. Matheson S.F. Settleman J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). And although Reelin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Dab1 in neurons appears to be primarily mediated by Fyn, Src can phosphorylate Dab1 when Fyn is absent (37Arnaud L. Ballif B.A. Forster E. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 9-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This implies that both Fyn and Src can access p190 RhoGAP and Dab1. It is known that an alternative form of Src, neuronal Src (NSrc), is expressed during neuronal differentiation (38Brugge J.S. Cotton P.C. Queral A.E. Barrett J.N. Nonner D. Keane R.W. Nature. 1985; 316: 554-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). NSrc differs from the normal splice form (called here cSrc) by 6 amino acids (RKVDVR) that are inserted into the SH3 domain because of an alternative splicing event (39Levy J.B. Dorai T. Wang L.H. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4142-4145Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 40Martinez R. Mathey-Prevot B. Bernards A. Baltimore D. Science. 1987; 237: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The activity of NSrc is 2–4-fold higher than that of cSrc (41Brugge J. Cotton P. Lustig A. Yonemoto W. Lipsich L. Coussens P. Barrett J.N. Nonner D. Keane R.W. Genes Dev. 1987; 1: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 42Cartwright C.A. Simantov R. Kaplan P.L. Hunter T. Eckhart W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1830-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It is thought that these 6 amino acids destabilize the inactive conformation of Src, thereby leading to enhanced activity (43Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the inclusion of these amino acids alters the localization of Src in cells and perhaps redistributes Src into lipid rafts. Consistent with this hypothesis, the NSrc insert is on a surface of the SH3 domain which is thought to be close to the membrane (43Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). If NSrc is in lipid rafts, that may explain the observed partial redundancy with Fyn. Indeed, some reports place Src in lipid rafts, despite the absence of a palmitoylation signal. Some studies used “pan-Src” antibody, or antibodies against the phosphorylated activation loop tyrosine of Src, which do not distinguish Src from other SFKs (44Tansey M.G. Baloh R.H. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 611-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 45Lee H. Park D.S. Wang X.B. Scherer P.E. Schwartz P.E. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34556-34567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, Src monoclonal antibodies have been used to show ligand-stimulated Src recruitment to EphrinB1-containing microdomains in neurons (46Palmer A. Zimmer M. Erdmann K.S. Eulenburg V. Porthin A. Heumann R. Deutsch U. Klein R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and specific antibodies show the coexistence of Src, Fyn, Lyn, and Yes in rafts from neuroblastoma cells (47Prinetti A. Iwabuchi K. Hakomori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20916-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 48Kalka D. von Reitzenstein C. Kopitz J. Cantz M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 989-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that Src itself is actually localized to rafts, at least in some tissues. We have investigated further whether Src itself is in lipid rafts and found that up to 20% of mouse brain Src is in lipid rafts. However, Src is not in lipid rafts in fibroblasts. As expected, the major form of Src in mouse brain is NSrc, but isoform differences do not explain the presence of Src in brain lipid rafts. When NSrc is expressed in fibroblasts it does not enter rafts. Localization to lipid rafts in brain requires only the amino-terminal myristoylation signal and not the SH3 region containing the NSrc insert and depends on brain lipids. Finally, to begin to understand the function of NSrc in rafts, we explored the kinase activity of NSrc in mouse brain and found that total NSrc kinase activity is dependent not only on the isoform but also on raft association. Cell Lines, Culture, and Transfection—SYF1 cells, derived from src-/- yes-/- fyn-/- mouse embryos using T antigen, were described previously (49Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2459-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). To generate SYF1 cells reexpressing either mouse cSrc or mouse NSrc a standard retroviral infection protocol was used (50Miller A.D. Rosman G.J. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 980-982PubMed Google Scholar). The retroviral vector pLXSH containing Src cDNA was used to generate viruses in 293T cells, followed by exposure of target SYF1 to these viruses at a low multiplicity of infection. The day after viral infection, SYF cells were selected with 0.2 mg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem). Src expression was verified by Western blotting. After the initial selection, stable cell lines (selected as pools, not clones) were maintained in the absence of hygromycin, and all cell lines were used at low passage number for all experiments. Fyn3 cells, SYF1 cells reexpressing Fyn cDNA, were provided by Dr. L. A. Cary. SYF1 cells, Src- or Fyn-reexpressing SYF cells, and human embryonic kidney 293T cell lines were all grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). 293T cells were transfected with DNA:calcium phosphate coprecipitates using the HEPES-buffered calcium phosphate method. Transfection medium was replaced by fresh culture medium 24 h after transfection, and cells were lysed 48 h after transfection. For retrovirus production 4 ml of fresh medium was added after 48 h, and virus was collected between 60 to 72 h post-transfection. SYF cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) using methods described by the manufacturer. Transfection medium was replaced with fresh culture medium 12 h post-transfection, and cells were lysed 48 h post-transfection. Animals—All mice used in this study were hybrid C57BL6J/129Sv. Genotyping typing was performed by PCR on tail DNA Expression Plasmids—Construction of mouse Src cDNA expression plasmids pSGT-cSrc, pSGT-NSrc, pLXSH-cSrc, and pLXSH-NSrc are described in Ref. 37Arnaud L.

Hemagglutinin epitope (HA)-tagged cSrc and NSrc cDNAs were constructed by replacing the stop codon of Src cDNA in pSGT-Src with an XhoI site and subcloning the sequenced BamHI-XhoI fragment into pIRES-hrGFP-2a.1 (Stratagene).

Src NH2-terminal 7 amino acids were fused to GFP (pCMX-Src7aa-GFP) by first replacing the start codon of GFP in pCMX-GFP with a HindIII-ATG-KpnI cassette (pCMX-Δ ATG-GFP). A HindIII-KpnI adaptor encoding the first 7 amino acids of Src, MGSNKSK, was prepared by boiling the oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTCCATGGGCAGCAACAAGAGCAAGGGTAC-3′ and 5′-CCTTGCTCTTGTTGCTGCCCATGGA-3′ and annealing them at room temperature. The double-stranded adaptor was purified from a 15% acrylamide-TBE gel after ethidium bromide staining, excising the DNA band, and eluting DNA from the gel piece by overnight incubation in water. Double-stranded adaptors encoding the G2A mutant, MASNKSK, were purified similarly. These adaptors were cloned into HindIII- and KpnI-digested pCMX-Δ ATG-GFP. All plasmids were sequenced to confirm the appropriate changes. Antibodies—Anti-Src monoclonal antibody (MAb) LA074 was produced from LP-016 mouse hybridoma cells (NCI Repository, Viromed Biosafety Laboratories, Camden, NJ) and diluted from an unpurified cell supernatant. This MAb was raised against amino acids 2–17 of v-Src. The anti-Src MAb 327 was a kind gift from Dr. J. S. Brugge (Harvard University). An anti-pan-Src antibody that recognizes Src, Yes, and Fyn, SRC2, and anti-Fyn antibody, FYN3, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-Src Tyr-418 (referred to as such for anti-phospho autocatalytic tyrosine) and anti-phospho-Src Tyr-529 (referred to as such for anti-phospho carboxyl-terminal tyrosine) antibody were from Biosource. Anti-HA antibody HA.11 was from Covance, anti-caveolin antibody from Transduction Laboratories, and anti-GFP antibody from Roche Applied Science. The anti-GST antibody 38.3 was described earlier (52Waskiewicz A.J. Flynn A. Proud C.G. Cooper J.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1909-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Bio-Rad. Preparation of Lipid Rafts—Lipid rafts were isolated from cells and brain tissue primarily as described earlier (53Kawabuchi M. Satomi Y. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Nada S. Nagai K. Tarakhovsky A. Okada M. Nature. 2000; 404: 999-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Briefly, frozen brain tissue was weighed and homogenized in an ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 5% glycerol in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) at a ratio of 8:1 (v/w) by 5 strokes with a loose pestle followed by 10 strokes with a tight pestle of an all glass homogenizer, while keeping the entire apparatus chilled on ice. The brain lysates were collected in microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min in a cooled tabletop microcentrifuge to sediment nuclei and tissue debris. The supernatant was collected and used for preparation of lipid rafts. Cultured adherent cells, in culture dishes, were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and scraped and collected in chilled PBS. The cells were centrifuged gently in a clinical centrifuge, and PBS was aspirated. The packed cell volume was estimated, and the cell pellet was gently resuspended in ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer at a ratio of 8:1 (v/v). After mixing on ice for 20 min, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min in a cooled tabletop microcentrifuge to sediment nuclei, and the supernatant was collected for preparation of lipid rafts. The Triton X-100 lysates collected as described above were mixed on ice for at least 1 h. Then, to 1 ml of the lysate, 1 ml of an 80% sucrose solution in buffer A was gradually added with continuous mixing on ice resulting in a solution containing 40% sucrose. 1.9 ml of this mixture was placed at the bottom of a 5-ml ultracentrifuge tube (Ultraclear, Beckman), and 2.5 ml of a 35% sucrose solution in buffer A and 0.7 ml of a 5% sucrose solution in buffer A were sequentially layered to form a small scale sucrose step gradient. These sucrose gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 55 rotor for 16 h at 200,000 × g and at 4 °C. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the top and analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Often, lipid raft material was collected from the interface between 5 and 35% sucrose in one 0.5-ml “raft” fraction, and the last four fractions were combined to produce a 2-ml mixture of “soluble” fraction. In general 50 μl of raft or soluble fractions was precipitated by mixing with 20 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid and incubating on ice for 30 min followed by high speed centrifugation at 4 °C for 15 min. The trichloroacetic acid precipitates were washed with 250 μl of ice-cold acetone, air dried, and resuspended in 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The raft fractions are thus overloaded by a factor of 4 relative to the nonraft fractions. However, the total protein in the raft fractions was less than 1% of the protein in the soluble fractions. For immunoprecipitation reactions (see below), raft fractions were solubilized by adding octyl β-d-glucopyranoside (Calbiochem) to a final concentration of 2%. In mixing experiments, lysates, recombinant proteins, and lipid preparations were mixed together in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer on ice for at least 2 h prior to mixing with 80% sucrose solution in buffer A. In some experiments, a Triton X-100-soluble fraction of a cell lysate was isolated by ultracentrifugation of a 1% Triton X-100 lysate in an airdriven ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at maximum air pressure and at 4 °C, thus precipitating insoluble material. Immunoprecipitation, Gel Electrophoresis, and Western Blot Analysis—Total protein levels in lysates were measured using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye, and equivalent amounts of protein were used for immunoprecipitation from Triton X-100 fractions. Because the total protein in lipid raft fractions was limitingly low for measurement, same volume equivalents of raft fraction as soluble fractions were used when comparing abundance of proteins in each fraction. Alternatively, for standardization purposes prior to immunoprecipitation kinase assays, or to compare phosphorylation status of proteins, a range of amounts of immunoprecipitates was analyzed. 1% Triton X-100 lysates, with or without added octyl β-d-glucopyranoside, were mixed with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) to obtain a total volume of 600 μl. Immunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating the indicated primary antibodies with the cell lysates for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes formed with rabbit antibodies were precipitated by incubating the reactions with protein A-immobilized Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma) for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes formed with mouse antibodies were immunoprecipitated by a similar incubation with either protein G-immobilized Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) or with rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G and protein A-immobilized Sepharose CL-4B beads. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and were either resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blotting or processed through additional washes in preparation for kinase assays. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (8Cary L.A. Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2427-2440Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar); however, different acrylamide concentration in gels and different acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratios were used to obtain optimal separation of proteins. The different gel properties are described in the legends of each experiment. Most notable are the 8 or 9% acrylamide gels with a 20:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide ratio which were used to separate Src or Fyn from the immunoglobulin G heavy chain in immunoprecipitates. The proteins were transferred to pure nitrocellulose filters (0.22 μm pore size), and the were filters stained with Ponceau S to confirm proper transfer and subsequently blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with indicated primary antibody for either 1 or 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After incubation with the indicated primary antibody, the filters were washed three times with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The filters were washed three times with TBST and once TBS, and immune complexes formed on the blot were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Western Lighting (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) chemiluminescence reagent. Immunoprecipitate Kinase Assays—Src immunoprecipitates using MAb LA074 or MAb 327 were washed three times with ice-cold radio-immunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer, once with buffer PAN (10 mm PIPES, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 20 μg/ml aprotinin) containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, once with buffer PAN and once with kinase buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 7, 4 mm MnCl2). Rabbit muscle enolase (Sigma) was denatured with 50 mm acetic acid for 5 min at 30 °C and buffered with 1 m PIPES, pH 7.0. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in kinase buffer containing 1 μm ATP and 5 μCi of [γ32P]ATP and 1.5 μg of acid-denatured enolase as a substrate, per reaction, for 5 or 10 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were either blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, processed for Western blotting and autoradiography, or dried and directly visualized by autoradiography. V8 Protease Mapping—Src immunoprecipitates using MAb LA074 were washed three times with ice-cold radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and once with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij 35, 2 mm MnCl2). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 400 units of fresh λ phosphatase (New England Biolabs) at 30 °C"

MenB, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA synthase, the fourth enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway leading from chorismate to menaquinone, catalyzes the conversion of O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA) to 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA (DHNA-CoA). Based on our interest in developing novel tuberculosis chemotherapeutics, we have solved the structures of MenB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its complex with acetoacetyl-coenzyme A at 1.8 and 2.3 Å resolution, respectively. Like other members of the crotonase superfamily, MenB folds as an (α3)2 hexamer, but its fold is distinct in that the C terminus crosses the trimer-trimer interface, forming a flexible part of the active site within the opposing trimer. The highly conserved active site of MenB contains a deep pocket lined by Asp-192, Tyr-287, and hydrophobic residues. Mutagenesis shows that Asp-192 and Tyr-287 are essential for enzymatic catalysis. We postulate a catalytic mechanism in which MenB enables proton transfer within the substrate to yield an oxyanion as the initial step in catalysis. Knowledge of the active site geometry and characterization of the catalytic mechanism of MenB will aid in identifying new inhibitors for this potential drug target.

Critical issues in the treatment and control of tuberculosis, a disease that kills more than two million people world-wide every year (1Kochi A. Tubercle. 1991; 72: 1-6Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 2Bloom B.R. Murray C.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1245) Google Scholar), include the role of this disease as a major opportunistic pathogen in patients with HIV-AIDS and the emergence of multidrug resistance strains of M. tuberculosis (MDRTB) (3Snider Jr., D.E. Roper W.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 703-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 4Perlman D.C. Hanvanich M. Aids. 1997; 11: S173-S179PubMed Google Scholar, 5Rattan A. Kalia A. Ahmad N. Emerg. Infect Dis. 1998; 4: 195-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Based on the knowledge that menaquinone is the sole quinone in M. tuberculosis and that humans must obtain this vitamin (K2) either in their diet or from intestinal bacteria, menaquinone biosynthesis may be an attractive novel target for anti-TB drug discovery. Consequently, we have initiated studies on the putative biosynthetic enzymes in this pathway from M. tuberculosis. Quinones are lipid-soluble molecules that shuttle electrons between the membrane-bound protein complexes in the electron transport chain. In mammalian cells, the electron transport chain is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane where the membrane-soluble quinone is ubiquinone, a benzoquinone (coenzyme Q, Fig. 1). In prokaryotes, the electron transport chain sometimes utilizes menaquinone, a naphthoquinone (vitamin K2, Fig. 1), in addition to or instead of ubiquinone. The principal structural variations within the two main classes of quinones occur from the length of the isoprenoid chain. Thus, in mitochondria the ubiquinone has a side chain of 10 isoprene units (CoQ-10) while in Escherichia coli the ubiquinone has a side chain of 8 isoprene units (CoQ-8) (6Lester R.L. Crane F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2169-2175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli, a facultative anaerobe, utilizes ubiquinone (CoQ-8) under aerobic conditions, but uses menaquinone (MK-8) when grown anaerobically (6Lester R.L. Crane F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2169-2175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bishop D.H.L. Pandya K.P. King H.K. Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 606-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Bacillus subtilis, a Gram-positive aerobe, contains only menaquinone (MK-7) (7Bishop D.H.L. Pandya K.P. King H.K. Biochem. J. 1962; 83: 606-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, inactivation of genes encoding the menaquinone biosynthetic enzymes in B. subtilis produces an absolute requirement for menaquinone or a downstream metabolite in the growth media (8Meganathan R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9386-9388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rowland B. Hill K. Miller P. Driscoll J. Taber H. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 167: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Several pieces of data support the notion that M. tuberculosis, like B. subtilis, utilizes only menaquinone in the electron transport chain. Firstly, studies classifying bacteria based on their quinone content identified only menaquinone and not ubiquinone in M. tuberculosis (6Lester R.L. Crane F.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2169-2175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Noll H. J. Biol. Chem. 1958; 232: 919-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Collins M.D. Pirouz T. Goodfellow M. Minnikin D.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1977; 100: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1858) Google Scholar). Secondly, Goldman and co-workers (12Segel W.P. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 380-390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Kusunose E. Goldman D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) isolated the NADH oxidase system from M. tuberculosis and demonstrated that it catalyzed the reduction of naphthoquinones. Lastly, the M. tuberculosis genome contains homologs of most of the E. coli men genes (see below and genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/, Ref. 14Cole S.T. Brosch R. Parkhill J. Garnier T. Churcher C. Harris D. Gordon S.V. Eiglmeier K. Gas S. Barry III, C.E. Tekaia F. Badcock K. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Connor R. Davies R. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Hamlin N. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Jagels K. Barrell B.G. et al.Nature. 1998; 393: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (6557) Google Scholar). Conversely, homologs of some of the key ubiquinone biosynthetic genes are absent. For example, there is no homolog of chorismate pyruvate-lyase (UbiC), the enzyme that converts chorismate into 4-hydroxybenzoate (15Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Taylor S. Tandon M. Nicewonger R. Wu M.

The proposed pathway from E. coli, where the primary menaquinone has a 40 carbon isoprene chain (MK-8), is shown in Fig. 2. Chorismate, derived from the shikimate pathway, is initially converted into isochorismate by MenF, an isochorismate synthase (30Daruwala R. Kwon O. Meganathan R. Hudspeth M.E. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 140: 159-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then to 2-succinyl-6-hydroxy-2,4-cyclohexadiene-1-carboxylate (SHCHC) by the action of MenD, a thiamin-dependent enzyme (31Meganathan R. Bentley R. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 739-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Palaniappan C. Sharma V. Hudspeth M.E. Meganathan R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8111-8118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SHCHC is then dehydrated by MenC to give the aromatic compound O-succinylben-zoate (OSB) 1The abbreviations used are: OSB-CoA, O-succinylbenzoyl-coenzyme A; AA-CoA, acetoacetyl-coenzyme A; DHNA-CoA, 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA; rms, root mean square; asu, asymmetric unit; NCS, non-crystallographic symmetry; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (33Sharma V. Meganathan R. Hudspeth M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4917-4921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MenC, which is a member of the enolase superfamily, is perhaps the best studied enzyme from the E. coli pathway and an x-ray structure has been determined by Gerlt and co-workers (34Palmer D.R. Garrett J.B. Sharma V. Meganathan R. Babbitt P.C. Gerlt J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4252-4258Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and Rayment and co-workers (35Thompson T.B. Garrett J.B. Taylor E.A. Meganathan R. Gerlt J.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10662-10676Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Following the MenC reaction, OSB is then converted into 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoic acid (DHNA) by the actions of at least two enzymes. Following the ATP-dependent synthesis of OSB-CoA by MenE (36Sharma V. Hudspeth M.E. Meganathan R. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 168: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), a member of the acyl-CoA ligase superfamily (37Chang K.H. Xiang H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15650-15659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the naphthoquinol skeleton of DHNA is generated via a cyclization reaction catalyzed by 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoyl-CoA synthase, MenB (27Meganathan R. Bentley R. Taber H. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 328-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Meganathan R. Bentley R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5336-5340Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 39Sharma V. Suvarna K. Meganathan R. Hudspeth M.E. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5057-5062Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It was previously thought that MenB also catalyzed the hydrolysis of DHNA-CoA to DHNA. However Meganathan (43Meganathan R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 203: 131-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has recently proposed that yfbB, an open reading frame that follows menD in the E. coli operon, codes for a thioesterase that fulfills this function. Finally, in the last two steps of the pathway, menaquinone is synthesized from DHNA by the actions of MenA, which catalyzes the prenylation of DHNA, and by MenG, an S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyl transferase. In another example of divergence between mammals and prokaryotes, the polyprenyl pyrophosphate required by MenA is synthesized via a non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway (40Schwender J. Seemann M. Lichtenthaler H.K. Rohmer M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316 (Pt 1): 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 41Putra S.R. Disch A. Bravo J.M. Rohmer M. FEMS Microbiol.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although electron transport in humans does not involve menaquinone, this compound plays an essential role in blood clotting, for example being involved in the γ-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in prothrombin (45Dowd P. Ham S.W. Naganathan S. Hershline R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 419-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). However, humans cannot synthesize menaquinone (vitamin K2) and must obtain it in the diet or from bacteria present in the gut. Consequently, the menaquinone biosynthetic pathway in M. tuberculosis may be an attractive target for the development of novel chemotherapeutics. Based on the premise that menaquinone biosynthesis is essential for survival of M. tuberculosis, we have initiated a series of studies to identify and characterize the mycobacterial enzymes involved in this pathway. Although not organized into a distinct operon as they are in E. coli, the M. tuberculosis homologs of menA, menB, menC, menD, menE, and menH are clustered in one region of the genome (Fig. 3). Devolving from our long standing interest in the enzymology of enoyl-CoA hydratase and other members of the crotonase superfamily (46Bell A.F. Feng Y. Hofstein H.A. Parikh S. Wu J. Rudolph M.J. Kisker C. Whitty A. Tonge P.J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1247-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), we have initially focused on the putative 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA synthase, MenB, from M. tuberculosis (Rv0548c) which is 48% identical and 62% similar (over 285 out of 314 residues) to the E. coli homolog and is a member of the crotonase superfamily (47Wu W.J.

Here we report the 1.8 Å x-ray structure of the M. tuberculosis MenB, as well as the 2.3 Å structure of a complex with acetoacetyl-CoA (AA-CoA), which reveals the active site geometry and confirms that this enzyme is indeed a member of the crotonase superfamily as previously suggested (47Wu W.J. Anderson V.E. Raleigh D.P. Tonge P.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2211-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 48Gerlt J.A. Babbitt P.C. Annu. Rev.

We also demonstrate that MenB synthesizes 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoyl-CoA (DHNA-CoA) from O-succinylbenzoyl-CoA (OSB-CoA), as expected, and identify active site residues required for catalysis. Based on these studies, we propose a catalytic mechanism that will guide the search for inhibitors of this key enzyme of the menaquinone pathway. Materials—M. tuberculosis genomic DNA was obtained from the TB Research Materials Facility at Colorado State University. Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of MenB from M. Tuberculosis—Rv0548c, the gene encoding the putative 1,4-dihydroxynaphthoyl-CoA synthase (MenB) from M. tuberculosis, was obtained by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen). Use of the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites placed the menB gene in-frame with an N-terminal His tag sequence. Protein expression was performed using BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Following growth in 800 ml of LB media containing 0.2 mg/ml ampicillin and induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 10 ml of His-binding buffer (5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and lysed by 5 passages through a French Press cell (12,000 psi). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 33,000 rpm for 90 min at 4 °C, and the clarified supernatant was passed through a column containing 3 ml of His-bind resin (Novagen). The column was washed with 50 ml of His-binding buffer and 30 ml of wash buffer (60 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.9) before MenB was subsequently eluted using 20 ml of elution buffer (0.5 m imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). Fractions containing MenB were pooled and the imidazole immediately removed by chromatography on G-25 resin using 20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.0, as the elution buffer. The concentration of MenB was determined by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 41,370 m-1 cm-1 calculated from the primary sequence. Coupled Assay for MenB—OSB-CoA, the substrate for MenB, is unstable and decomposes relatively rapidly to OSB spirodilactone (Fig. 4). Consequently, we used a coupled assay with MenE, the preceding enzyme in the pathway, to synthesize OSB-CoA in situ. The menE gene from E. coli was amplified by PCR and ligated into a pET-15b plasmid in-frame with an N-terminal His tag sequence using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. Following overexpression in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, MenE was purified by His tag affinity purification following a similar protocol as described for MenB. The concentration of MenE was determined as described for MenB, using an extinction coefficient of 104,770 m-1 cm-1. Coupled assays contained OSB (130 μm), ATP (130 μm), CoA (2-130 μm), MenE (2 μm), and MenB (0.14 μm). The formation of the MenB product was monitored at 392 nm using a CARY-100 spectrophotometer. Reactions were initiated by the addition of MenB following preincubation of the other reactants for 10 min to allow complete conversion of OSB to OSB-CoA. All kinetics were performed at 25 °C. Product formation was also monitored using reversed-phase HPLC. Reaction mixtures were analyzed using a Vydac C18 analytical column and running a gradient of 0-40% buffer B over 40 min at 1 ml/min. Buffer A was 50 mm NH4+CH3COO-, pH 5.9 while buffer B was 100% methanol. Crystallization and Structure Solution—Wild-type MenB was crystallized using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method, equilibrating a mixture of 1 μl of protein solution and 1 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.5-2% dioxane, 1.2-1.3 m (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 m MES pH 6.5 against an excess of reservoir solution. Crystals were soaked in reservoir solution containing 30% glycerol and subsequently cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen. Data were collected at beamline X26C at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, equipped with an ADSC Quantum 4 detector. Diffraction data were indexed, integrated, and scaled using the HKL software (50Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 276. Academic Press, 1997: 307-326Google Scholar). Crystals belong to space group P21 with a = 90.4 Å, b = 139.4 Å, c = 142.0 Å, and β = 97.3°, and contain 2 (α3)2 hexamers per asymmetric unit (asu). Dynamic light scattering suggests that MenB is a hexamer in solution. The self-rotation function of the diffraction data is compatible with two hexamers of 32 point symmetry in the asu. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the programs BEAST (51Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) and COMO (52Jogl G. Tao X. Xu Y. Tong L. Acta Crystallogr D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1127-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) for the rotation and translation search, respectively and the structure of the hexamer of enoyl-CoA hydratase (PDB code 1DUB) as a search model. The presence of two hexamers per asu allowed 12-fold density averaging with the program DM (53Bailey S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) to extend phases from 4 Å to 1.8 Å resolution. The main chain of various loops and the C-terminal residues 270-314 were rebuilt using the program O (54Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Side chains from enoyl-CoA hydratase were replaced with those from MenB using Swiss-Pdb Viewer (55Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar) and fitted into the electron density using the program O. 12-fold non-crystallographic symmetry (NCS) restraints were maintained throughout the entire refinement process using REFMAC (56Brünger A.T. X-PLOR version 3.1-A system for X-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven and London1992Google Scholar, 57Murshudov G. Vagin A. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar). The tightness of constraints was chosen to minimize the free R-value. The average root mean square deviation of equivalent main chain and side chain atoms of NCS-related subunits is 0.05 Å and 0.30 Å, respectively. MenB crystals were soaked with AA-CoA at a concentration of 2.2 mm. Crystals were cryo-protected and data were collected as described above. The soaked crystals were isomorphous to the unsoaked MenB crystals, allowing difference Fourier methods to be used for the calculation of electron density maps. AA-CoA was modeled into the density and refined at an occupancy of 0.75. Preparation and Kinetic Assays of MenB Mutants—QuikChange mutagenesis (Stratagene) was used to generate the R133A, Y287F, D185N and D192N MenB mutants. Following DNA sequencing, the mutant enzymes were overexpressed and purified using the method described for wild-type MenB. Subsequently, the coupled assay with MenE was used to assay each of the mutant MenB proteins. Enzymatic Activity of M. tuberculosis MenB—Wild-type MenB was assayed using a coupled assay in which OSB-CoA, the substrate for MenB, was generated in situ by the action of MenE on OSB, ATP and CoA (Fig. 2). Sufficient MenE was included in reaction mixtures so that OSB-CoA was formed from OSB and CoA rapidly enough to preclude significant decomposition of OSB-CoA to the spirodilactone prior to the addition of MenB. In the presence of MenB, UV-visible absorption scans revealed the time-dependent formation of a species with λmax at 392 nm that corresponded to a new peak upon HPLC analysis eluting at 39.7 min, while OSB, ATP, and CoA eluted at 6.7, 5.1, and 21.6 min, respectively. The product peak obtained by HPLC was characterized by two absorption bands with λmax values at 260 and 392 nm, consistent with the presumption that it was 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoyl-CoA (DHNA-CoA). Assuming that only CoA absorbed at 260 nm, the observed product absorbance ratio A 260/A 392 of 4 allowed the estimation of an extinction coefficient at 392 nm of 4,000 m-1 cm-1 for the product. Using this extinction coefficient, wild type MenB had k cat and K m values of 14.9 ± 0.4 min-1 and 7.3 ± 0.9 μm, respectively, assuming that the concentration of OSB-CoA in the reaction mixture was equal to the limiting MenE substrate (CoA). To confirm that the product of the MenB-catalyzed reaction was indeed DHNA-CoA, a reaction mixture in 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 7) was analyzed using ESI-MSMS before and after the addition of MenB. Mass spectrometry (M+H) revealed the MenB-dependent formation of a single species with a mass of 954.1 Da consistent with the mass expected for DHNA-CoA (M+H for C32H42N7O19P3S = 954.14691 Da). Crystal Structure of MenB—MenB crystals belong to space group P21 with unit cell dimensions: a = 90.4 Å, b = 139.4 Å, c = 142.0 Å, and β = 97.3°. Initial phases were calculated by molecular replacement using enoyl-CoA hydratase (Ref. 58Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K.

The model has good overall stereochemistry with 91% of all residues in the most favorable regions of the Ramachandran diagram and 9% in additionally allowed regions as defined by PROCHECK (59Laskowski R.A.

The quarternary structures of the two hexamers are almost identical as well, with rms deviations of 0.132 Å over all Cα atoms. The overall fold of MenB is characteristic of the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase (crotonase) superfamily. Seven other members of this family have been structurally characterized to date, namely enoyl-CoA hydratase (Ref. 58Engel C.K. Mathieu M. Zeelen J.P. Hiltunen J.K. Wierenga R.K.

The fold of each of these enzymes is fundamentally identical except for domain swapping of the C-terminal residues (60Benning M.M. Haller T. Gerlt J.A. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4630-4639Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In three-dimensional domain swapping, one domain of a subunit is replaced by the same domain from an identical subunit, resulting in an intertwined oligomer (66Bennett M.J. Schlunegger M.P. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2455-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The two C-terminal α-helices of the crotonase fold (corresponding to α9 and α10 spanning residues 271-288 and 290-301 in MenB) are oriented in different directions such that they are part of different active sites in the hexameric structures (Fig. 6). In Δ3-Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase, 6-oxo camphor hydrolase, and methylmalonyl CoA decarboxylase, the C terminus folds back onto the core domain such that it covers the active site of its own subunit (Fig. 6D). This is in contrast to enoyl-CoA hydratase, 4-chlorobenzoyl CoA dehalogenase, dienoyl CoA isomerase, and the human AUH protein, in which the C terminus protrudes away from the core domain and covers the active site of an adjacent subunit within the trimer (Fig. 6C). MenB is the first structurally characterized superfamily member that uses its C terminus to cross over the trimer-trimer interface, forming part of the active site of a subunit on the opposing trimer (Fig. 6, A and B).

The level of the ORC1 subunit oscillates throughout the cell cycle, defining an ORC1 cycle. ORC1 accumulates in G1 and is degraded in S phase, although other ORC subunits (ORCs 2–5) remain at almost constant levels. The behavior of ORC components in human cell nuclei with respect to the ORC1 cycle demonstrates that ORCs 2–5 form a complex that is present throughout the cell cycle and that associates with ORC1 when it accumulates in G1 nuclei. ORCs 2–5 are found in both nuclease-insoluble and -soluble fractions. The appearance of nuclease-insoluble ORCs 2–5 parallels the increase in the level of ORC1 associating with nuclease-insoluble, non-chromatin nuclear structures. Thus, ORCs 2–5 are temporally recruited to nuclease-insoluble structures by formation of the ORC1–5 complex. An artificial reduction in the level of ORC1 in human cells by RNA interference results in a shift of ORC2 to the nuclease-soluble fraction, and the association of MCM proteins with chromatin fractions is also blocked by this treatment. These results indicate that ORC1 regulates the status of the ORC complex in human nuclei by tethering ORCs 2–5 to nuclear structures. This dynamic shift is further required for the loading of MCM proteins onto chromatin. Thus, the pre-replication complex in human cells may be regulated by the temporal accumulation of ORC1 in G1 nuclei.

Prior to the initiation of DNA replication, ORC forms a large protein complex, called the pre-replicative complex (pre-RC), in association with other initiation factors, including Cdc6 and the mini-chromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins. The pre-RC then changes to a post-replicative form with the dissociation of these factors, in parallel with alterations in the ORC-DNA interaction (2Liang C. Stillman B.

Recent studies have demonstrated that several nuclear events, including replication, take place in specialized compartments where specific factors assemble in highly organized structures (23Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 162: 455-484Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand how replication is initiated and regulated in eukaryotic cells, it is necessary to determine how replication proteins are assembled into higher order complexes and how they are distributed among subnuclear compartments. Previous studies have demonstrated that MCMs associate with pre-replicative chromatin and subsequently dissociate upon the initiation of replication (2Liang C. Stillman B.

Similarly, mammalian CDC6 proteins appear to accumulate in G1 phase nuclei and to move to the cytoplasm in early S phase (27Fujita M. Yamada C. Goto H. Yokoyama N. Kuzushima K. Inagaki M. Tsurumi T.

These observations suggest that the dynamic behavior of these proteins in S phase nuclei may be linked to the mechanism that restricts replication to only once per cell cycle. In budding yeast, however, ORC behaves as a static nuclear component and associates with chromatin DNA throughout the cell cycle (2Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Diffley J.F. Cocker J.H. Dowell S.J. Rowley A.

Cell. 1997; 90: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Despite the overall high conservation of ORC proteins among species, animal ORCs exhibit greater regulatory flexibility than their yeast counterparts. For example, expression of the mammalian ORC1 gene is regulated by the E2F protein (16Ohtani K. DeGregori J. Leone G. Herendeen D.R. Kelly T.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6977-6984Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and Xenopus ORC is known to dissociate from metaphase chromatin, as observed in an egg extract system (11Romanowski P. Madine M.A. Rowles A. Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1416-1425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In addition, the Drosophila ORC1 protein changes in abundance depending on developmental stage and on the cell cycle, and ectopic expression of DmORC1 alters the program of proliferation. This finding suggests that ORC, and especially ORC1, regulates the growth of animal cells by controlling S phase progression (30Asano M. Wharton R.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2435-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Indeed, the accompanying paper (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) describes an ORC1 cycle in human cells, which is characterized by ORC1 accumulation during G1 and reduction during the S phase. In this study, we demonstrate that chromatin-bound ORC2–5 subunits are recruited to nuclease-insoluble, non-chromatin structures in a manner that parallels the ORC1 cycle. Furthermore, this shift in the distribution of ORCs 2–5 tightly correlates with the partitioning of MCMs to chromatin fractions. These results strongly suggest that the accumulation of ORC1 precedes replication complex assembly in human nuclei prior to the S phase. Cell Culture and Synchronization—Cell culture, synchronization, and monitoring of the cell cycle were done as described (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol.

Fractionation of Cellular Proteins—Whole cell extract preparation and fractionation of proteins from HeLa S3 cells with Triton X-100 (Triton), NaCl, or DNase I were done as described (31Tatsumi Y.

RNA Interference Experiments—RNA interference (RNAi) experiments were done essentially as specified by “The siRNA User's Guide” (www.mpibpc.gwdg.de/abteilungen/100/105/sirna.html). Annealed siRNAs specific for ORC1 (ORC1 plus 73a, 5′-CUGCACUACCAAACCUAUAdTdT; ORC1 plus 73b, 5′-UAUAGGUUUGGUAGUGCAGTT-3′), CDC6 (CDC6 plus 82, 5′-CUCCAGUGAUGCCAAACUAdTdT-3′; 5′-UAGUUUGGCATCACUGGAGdTdT-3′), LaminA/C (33Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar), and pGL (luciferase, 33) were transfected into HeLa S3 cells with Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instruction. Cells were harvested and fractionated 2 days after transfection. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—All antibodies used in this study have been described (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). #209 (anti-ORC1 antibody) beads were prepared by immobilization of the purified antibody to protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, UK), at a ratio of 2 μg of IgG to 10 μl of beads, with dimethyl pimelimidate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). ORC1 was precipitated from 0.1% TX-300mCSK extracts (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol.

For ORC2, the same lysate was incubated with 1 μg of 3B7 (MBL) at 4 °C for 2 h, followed by addition of 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The supernatants were recovered as unbound fractions. The beads were washed twice with 0.1% TX-300mCSK, and elutes were obtained with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.0) and neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8). All immunoblotting procedures were as described (32Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometry—All procedures were essentially done as described previously (34Ohta S. Shiomi Y. Sugino K. Obuse O. Tsurimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40362-40367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and the region of the gel-containing proteins from about 200 to 30 kDa (Fig. 2) was cut at intervals of ∼1 mm. Proteins in the gel slices were subjected to reduction, alkylation, and tryptic digestion with modified trypsin (Roche Applied Science, Germany) at 37 °C for 14 h. After in-gel digestion, the product peptides were extracted with 5% formic acid and acetonitrile, dried under vacuum, and dissolved in 5% formic acid. Multiply digested peptides from each gel slice were separated by micro-capillary C18-reverse phase chromatography (200 μm × 5-cm capillary, Michrom BioResources) and directly applied to an LCQ Advantage quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan) with a nanoelectrospray needle (New Objective) mounted on a 3D-stage (AMR, Japan). The primary ion spectrum data generated by LC/MS/MS were screened against the NCBI non-redundant protein data base with the Mascot program (Matrix Science, UK) to identify high scoring proteins. Subcellular Localization of ORC Subunits in HeLa S3 Cells—To study the behavior of ORC subunits in human cells, proteins extracted from HeLa S3 cells growing asynchronously were fractionated into soluble and insoluble fractions by treatment with 0.1% TX-100mCSK. ORC1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 were predominantly found in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 1A), suggesting that they localize to chromatin. When the washed nuclei were further treated with DNase I to extract bulk chromatin-associated DNA (32Tatsumi Y. Tsurimoto T. Shirahige K. Yoshikawa H. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5904-5910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), most ORC1 remained associated with nuclease-insoluble nuclear structures (non-chromatin nuclear structures) (Fig. 1C). In contrast, about half of the ORC2, -3, -4, and -5 subunits (ORCs 2–5) were solubilized by this treatment, indicating that half of them are associated with nuclear structures (Fig. 1C). When the Triton-insoluble fraction was treated with buffers containing increasing concentrations of NaCl, ORC1 was solubilized by 0.3 m NaCl but not by 0.2 m NaCl, whereas ORCs 2–5 were gradually solubilized by 0.2 and 0.3 m NaCl, as shown in Fig. 1B. Composition of the ORC Complex in HeLa S3 Cells—To determine whether human ORC subunits are in a stable complex similar to yeast ORC, we studied co-immunoprecipitates with ORC1 from the Triton-insoluble fraction of HeLa S3 cells extracted with 0.3 m NaCl. Several specific bands were detectable on SDS-polyacrylamide gels of proteins precipitated with the #209 antibody (Fig. 2). To identify the proteins in these bands, slices from the gel were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides with ORC1 amino acid sequences were found in gel slice #10, which contained proteins of 100-kDa molecular mass. Peptides with ORC2 and ORC3 amino acid sequences were identified in gel slice #16 (67 kDa), and peptides with ORC4 and ORC5 amino acid sequences were found in gel slice #25 (45 kDa). To confirm this result, immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies against ORCs 2–5 (Fig. 3A). Under conditions in which most ORC1 in the lysate was precipitated, roughly half of the ORC2–5 proteins in the extract were co-immunoprecipitated with ORC1. This result was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged ORC1 with an anti-FLAG antibody from the 293-cell line, 1C2, which expresses the tagged protein at the same level as endogenous ORC1 (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). ORCs 2–5 were specifically precipitated with FLAG-ORC1 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that a protein complex consisting of the ORC1–5 subunits is present in the chromatin-bound fraction of human cell extracts. Cell Cycle-dependent Formation of the ORC1–5 Complex— Next, we studied whether ORCs1–5 persist as a tight complex throughout the cell cycle, as observed for yeast ORC. We prepared 0.3 m NaCl lysates from synchronously growing HeLa S3 cells after release from M phase arrest mediated by the drug TN16. Most cellular ORC1–5 subunits were extracted with 0.3 m NaCl (Fig. 1B). In this experiment, the level of ORC1 was low in metaphase and early G1 (0–3 h), rose between 6 and 12 h (middle G1), reached a peak at 12 h (G1/S), and then decreased from S to G2 phase, slightly in advance of the decrease in the level of cyclin E, as described in a previous study (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). The levels of the ORC2–5 subunits, however, remained essentially constant over time. The #209 antibody precipitated ORC1 at 9 and 12 h, times at which it accumulates, and it co-precipitated ORC2–4 subunits in the same period (Fig. 4, A and B). In a converse experiment with the anti-ORC2 antibody, constant amounts of both ORC2 and ORC3 were precipitated throughout the cell cycle (Fig. 4C), and ORC1 appeared in precipitates when it accumulated in cells. Interestingly, although the levels of ORC4 and 5 are constant throughout the cell cycle (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A), the amounts of these proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with ORC2 increased when ORC1 was present (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that ORC2 and ORC3 form a stable complex throughout the cell cycle and that their association with ORC4 and ORC5 is stabilized transiently when ORC1 accumulates on chromatin and associates with the ORC2–5 complex from late G1 to early S phase. Recruitment of ORCs 2–5 to a Non-chromatin Nuclear Structure through Interaction with ORC1—Although most ORC1 protein was found in a non-chromatin nuclear fraction in extracts from asynchronously growing cells, ORCs 2–5 partitioned into both DNase I-soluble and -insoluble fractions (Fig. 1C). Because accumulated ORC1 appeared to readily associate with ORCs 2–5 (Fig. 4), we speculated that ORCs 2–5 are recruited to the DNase I-insoluble fraction through their association with ORC1. To determine whether the re-distribution of ORCs 2–5 to the DNase I-insoluble fraction is cell cycle-dependent and occurs in G1, we fractionated ORC1 and ORC2 from synchronously growing cells after release from TN16-mediated arrest by DNase I digestion sensitivity (Fig. 5). From 0 (M phase) to 6 h (early G1 phase), most cellular ORC2 was soluble with DNase I. Subsequently, ORC2 started to appear in the insoluble fraction at 9 h and peaked at 12 h. This temporal association of ORC2 with the nuclease-insoluble fraction correlates well with the abundance of ORC1 in this fraction. To obtain more convincing evidence that ORC1 recruits ORCs 2–5 to DNase I-insoluble nuclear structures, we artificially eliminated ORC1 from cells by RNA interference (RNAi) and monitored the distribution of ORC2 in nuclear structures. As shown in Fig. 6A, within 2 days of transfection of ORC1 siRNA into HeLa S3 cells, ORC1 became undetectable. This reduction in ORC1 is specific to the ORC1 siRNA, because siRNAs specific for CDC6, lamin A/C, or luciferase (pGL2) did not affect the level of ORC1 but clearly caused their respective target proteins to disappear. When ORC1 was eliminated from cells, we observed an obvious shift of ORC2 from DNase I-insoluble fractions to DNase I-soluble fractions (Fig. 6B, ORC2). This result strongly supports the ORC1-dependent recruitment of ORC2 to DNase I-insoluble fractions as mentioned above. The Loading of MCM onto Chromatin Requires the ORC1–5 Complex and CDC6 Protein—We observed the temporal formation of the ORC1–5 complex in non-chromatin nuclear structures in G1 phase human cells. What is the functional meaning of this assembly? In budding yeast, MCM is loaded onto origin DNA in an ORC- and CDC6-dependent manner to form the pre-RC. In mammalian cells, the loading of MCM onto chromatin in G1 is simultaneous with the accumulation of ORC1 (Fig. 4) (31Tatsumi Y. Ohta S. Kimura H. Tsurimoto T. Obuse C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41528-41534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 35Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H. Kim S.Y. Hidaka M. Tansey W.P. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 481-491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). This result implies that ORC1–5 complex formation may be required for loading MCM onto chromatin. To test this possibility, we analyzed the effect of the ORC1-specific siRNA on MCM loading. The level of MCM3 in the chromatin fraction (Triton ppt) was greatly diminished by the reduction of ORC1 in HeLa S3 cells (Fig. 6A), strongly suggesting that the loading of MCM onto chromatin is not mediated by ORCs 2–5 but by the complete ORC1–5 complex. Interestingly, the elimination of CDC6 from cells by RNAi inhibited MCM loading. Thus, both CDC6 and ORCs1–5 are necessary for MCM loading onto chromatin in human cells. It is noteworthy that CDC6-specific siRNA treatment did not interfere with the association of ORC2 with the DNase I-insoluble fraction. On the other hand, elimination of ORC1 also did not affect the association of CDC6 with nuclease-insoluble fractions. Thus, the association of CDC6 with nuclear structures and the formation of the ORC1–5 complex on nuclear structures are independent. ORC was originally identified in budding yeast as a complex of six different subunits. All six subunit components of ORC have been identified in various eukaryotes, including humans, indicating that the configuration of the complex is conserved among eukaryotes (7Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 36DePamphilis M.L. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 310: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To date, stable ORC1–6 complexes have been isolated from yeast, flies, and frogs. However, although we detected the ORC1–5 complex in human cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-ORC1 or ORC2 antibodies, we could detect ORC6 in these precipitates neither by the sensitive technique of mass spectrometry (Fig. 2) nor by immunoblot analysis with the anti-ORC6 antibody (data not shown). Thus, ORC6 in human cells may interact with other ORC subunits only weakly, if at all. The same limited affinity of ORC6 for the ORC1–5 complex has been reported for reconstitution experiments using a baculovirus expression system (21Dhar S.K. Delmolino L. Dutta A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29067-29071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22Vashee S. Simancek P. Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26666-26673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These findings do not necessarily mean that ORC6 is less important for ORC function, because it has been reported that Drosophila ORC6 is important for the specific binding of ORC to origin DNA (37Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11997-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, ORC6 has a role in the regulation of ORC activity by its transient interaction with the ORC1–5 complex. Interestingly, it has been reported that human ORC6 has a role as a kinetochore complex component, in addition to its role in the initiation of replication (38Prasanth S.G. Prasanth K.V. Stillman B. Science. 2002; 297: 1026-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Further studies of its behavior during the cell cycle will be necessary to understand how human ORC6 functions in replication. We have demonstrated that the appearance of the ORC1–5 complex is cell cycle-dependent and regulated by the ORC1 cycle. Furthermore, ORC2 and ORC3 are always in a stable complex, but ORC4 and ORC5 are separable from ORC2 and ORC3 in the absence of ORC1. Thus, human ORC subunits have a dynamic assembly mechanism that is regulated primarily by the level of ORC1. This result indicates that the subunit configuration of ORC in animal cells is apparently different from that in budding yeast and that there are multiple assembly states, each of which has a distinct role in regulating replication complex formation at origins (Fig. 7). A prominent protein assembly in human cells is the ORC2–5 complex, which is always found in the chromatin fraction. It has been reported that ORC proteins specifically bind to replication origin sequences in budding yeast, fission yeast, and Drosophila (1Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar, 37Chesnokov I. Remus D. Botchan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11997-12002Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 39Chuang R.Y. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2656-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this association is maintained throughout the cell cycle in budding yeast. Recent studies have demonstrated that human ORC2 and ORC3 bind to the Epstein-Barr virus replication origin (oriP) and that ORC2 binds to a potential replication origin region in the human MCM4 locus throughout the cell cycle (40Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In contrast, human ORC1 associates with the MCM4 origin only in G1 phase (40Ladenburger E.M. Keller C. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1036-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The ORC2–5/chromatin complex that we have observed associates with ORC1 in G1. Due to the coincidence of the reported origin association and our observed chromatin binding of ORC subunits during the cell cycle, we suggest that the ORC2–5 complex associates with chromatin by binding to DNA, probably to potential origin sequences (Fig. 7A). If this is the case, human ORCs 2–5 are sufficiently active to recognize potential replication origin sequences and to bind them, like budding yeast ORC. Subsequently, some replication origins will be chosen by ORC1 and recruited to nuclear structures where replication machineries assemble (Fig. 7B). Formation of the ORC1–5 complex in nuclear structures promotes binding of MCM to chromatin, which corresponds to pre-RC formation (Fig. 7C). Once MCM is loaded, the ORC1–5 complex disassembles by the degradation of ORC1 (Fig. 7D). Subsequently, further initiation steps occur, including the loading of the DNA synthesis apparatus (Fig. 7E). This proposed mechanism has two implications. The first concerns the selection of origins to be fired from among the many sites potentially bound by the ORC2–5 complex. Thus, ORC1 may determine the timing and order of origin firing by recruiting ORC2–5/chromatin complexes to nuclear structures or sites. The second is to ensure that origins are fired only once per cell cycle, by the inactivation of ORC1 immediately after use. This model is consistent with previous reports that ori-β at the dihydrofolate reductase locus of Chinese hamster ovary cells and that the β-globin locus origin of HeLa S3 cells associate with similar nuclease-insoluble nuclear structures in late G1 and dissociate from them after the initiation of replication in S phase (41Djeliova V. Russev G. Anachkova B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3181-3187Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It is well known that in yeast and Xenopus, the loading of MCMs onto the ORC/origin complex corresponds to the formation of the pre-RC, a direct precursor of the complex that initiates replication. This step requires the essential components CDC6 and Cdt1, in addition to an active ORC complex (7Bell S.P. Dutta A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 333-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar, 36DePamphilis M.L. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 310: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We showed with RNAi experiments that both ORC1 and CDC6 are required for the loading of MCMs onto chromatin in human cells (Fig. 6). We also observed that the presence of the ORC2–5 complex in chromatin fractions is not sufficient for MCM loading onto chromatin. In yeast, ORCs 1–6 form a stable complex, and the transient accumulation of activator proteins primes a reaction to MCM loading. As discussed above, if the human ORC2–5 complex functions like the budding yeast ORC1–6 complex, human ORC1 and CDC6 may function as activators. In this respect, because the level of human ORC1 oscillates, so that it accumulates in concert with the loading of MCM, ORC1 may activate ORC functions as CDC6 does in budding yeast. Indeed, ORC1 and CDC6 share significant amino acid sequence similarity and are derived from the same ancestor (42Liu J. Smith C.L. DeRyckere D. DeAngelis K. Martin G.S. Berger J.M. Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, human CDC6 exhibits a pattern of oscillation opposite to that of ORC1, accumulating during S phase, peaking in M phase and decreasing in the following G1 phase (35Mendez J. Zou-Yang X.H.

This observation indicates that, although both CDC6 and ORC1 are required for MCM loading in human cells, they have distinct temporal patterns of expression roles and different roles in pre-RC formation. We have demonstrated that human ORC components exhibit a dynamic pattern of assembly during the cell cycle. Several lines of evidence strongly support the proposal that this assembly directly links temporal and spatial controls in the initiation of replication in human chromosomes. However, many questions remain to be answered: how does ORC recognize specific chromosomal DNAs, how are ATP binding and hydrolysis involved in dynamic assembly and in the initiation mechanism, how do further protein assemblies, for example, those including CDC6, CDT1, and CDC45, develop, and what is the significance of ORC1 degradation prior to origin firing? Further experiments will be necessary to answer these questions and to elucidate the mechanism by which DNA replication is regulated in animal cells. We thank Drs. Hisao Masukata (Osaka University) and Dr. Hiroshi Kimura (Tokyo Medical and Dental University) for critical reading of the manuscript and valuable comments, Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2021522009,"E2F6 contains a DNA binding domain that is very similar to that of the other members of the E2F family of transcriptional regulators. However, E2F6 cannot bind to all promoters that contain consensus E2F-binding sites. Therefore, we used a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic microarrays to identify promoters bound by E2F6 in human cells. Although most of the identified promoters were bound by multiple E2F family members, one promoter was bound only by E2F6. To determine which of the newly identified promoters were regulated by E2F6, we reduced the level of E2F6 by using RNA interference technology. We found that mRNA transcribed from promoters bound by E2F6 was increased after reduction of the amount of E2F6 protein in the cell. Interestingly, many of the E2F6-regulated genes encoded functions involved in tumor suppression and the maintenance of chromatin structure. Specifically, our results suggest that E2F6 represses transcription of the brca1, ctip, art27, hp1α, and the rbap48 genes. E2F6 has been postulated to mediate transcriptional repression by recruiting a histone H3 methyltransferase to the DNA. However, we found that the E2F6-regulated promoters did not contain histone H3 methylated at lysine 9. To determine the mechanism by which E2F6 regulates transcription, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation before and after the introduction of small inhibitory ribonucleic acids specific to E2F6. We found that depletion of E2F6 resulted in the recruitment of E2F1 to the target promoters. In summary, we have identified 48 endogenous target genes of E2F6 and have shown that E2F6 can repress target promoters in a manner that does not require histone H3 methylation at lysine 9.

In summary, we have identified 48 endogenous target genes of E2F6 and have shown that E2F6 can repress target promoters in a manner that does not require histone H3 methylation at lysine 9. The E2F family consists of six members, E2Fs 1-6, and two obligate heterodimeric partners, DP1 and DP2, which are required for binding to DNA (1Trimarchi J.M. Lees J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). All of the E2Fs contain a conserved DNA binding and dimerization domain, and the different E2F-DP heterodimers can bind to the same consensus sequence. E2Fs 1-5 each contain a C-terminal transactivation domain that can interact with a variety of transcriptional coactivators such as CREB 1The abbreviations used are: CREB, cAMP-response element-binding protein; Eu-HMTase, euchromatin-specific histone methyltransferase; ChIP-chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation-microarray analysis; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; siRNA, small inhibitory ribonucleic acid; RT, reverse transcriptase; myc, myelocytomatosis oncogene; art27, androgen receptor trapped clone 27; brca1, breast cancer 1; ctip, CTBP-interacting protein; rbap48, retinoblastoma-associated p48; hp1α, heterochromatin protein 1; htf6, human teratocarcinoma finger; gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; RNA pol II, RNA polymerase II; GFP, green fluorescence protein.-binding protein and TFIIH (2Fry C.J.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2643-2658Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain also contains sequences required for binding to the pocket protein family of transcriptional repressors (retinoblastoma, p107, and p130). E2Fs 1-3 interact preferentially with retinoblastoma, whereas E2F4 and -5 mainly associate with p107 or p130 (4Classon M. Harlow E. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Depending upon exactly which proteins associate with the C-terminal domain, E2Fs1-5 can therefore mediate either activation or repression. E2F6, the most recently identified E2F family member, lacks the C-terminal transactivation domain found in the other E2Fs. Therefore, E2F6 likely cannot serve as a transcriptional activator or bind to the pocket protein family. However, E2F6 has been shown to be a potent transcriptional repressor (5Morkel M. Wenkel J. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Hagemeier C. Nature. 1997; 390: 567-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 6Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Verona R. Moberg K. Andon N. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Because E2F6 lacks the pocket protein interaction domain, transcriptional repression may be mediated via interaction with other proteins. Yeast two-hybrid studies have shown that E2F6 can be found in a multiprotein complex with members of the Bmi1-containing Polycomb group complex of transcriptional repressors (9Trimarchi J.M. Fairchild B. Wen J. Lees J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1519-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that E2F6 is also a component of a complex that contains Polycomb group proteins such as RING1, RING2, MBLR, h-l(3)mbt-like protein, and YAF2 (10Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). A general function of Polycomb group complexes is to specify developmental patterning, which is accomplished, in part, by the repression of homeobox gene expression (11Jacobs J.J. van Lohuizen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 151-161PubMed Google Scholar). E2F6-null mice display homeotic transformations of the axial skeleton (12Storre J. Elsasser H.P. Fuchs M. Ullmann D. Livingston D.M. Gaubatz S. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and resemble animals lacking the Bmi1 polycomb group protein (13van der Lugt N.M. Domen J. Linders K. van Roon M. Robanus-Maandag E. te Riele H. van der Valk M. Deschamps J. Sofroniew M. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 757-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that an E2F6-containing Polycomb group complex is required to silence certain homeotic genes during development. Complexes containing Bmi1 are implicated in the development of cancer through the repression of the p16ink4a and p19arf genes (14Jacobs J.J. Scheijen B. Voncken J.W. Kieboom K. Berns A. van Lohuizen M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2678-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific link between E2F6 and the development of cancer. Also, support of a link between E2F6 and carcinogenesis comes from studies demonstrating that overexpression of E2F6 can alter cell growth parameters. For example, overexpressed E2F6 can inhibit entry into S phase of cells stimulated to exit G0 phase (7Gaubatz S. Wood J.G. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and can also delay the exit from S phase (8Cartwright P. Muller H. Wagener C. Holm K. Helin K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 611-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the possible links between E2F6 and cell growth control are intriguing, little is known about the exact genes regulated by E2F6, and it is not yet clear exactly how E2F6 mediates transcriptional regulation. Recently, Ogawa et al. (10Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) identified a novel euchromatic-specific histone methyltransferase (Eu-HMTase) as part of an E2F6-containing complex from HeLa cells, and this Eu-HMTase was shown to specifically methylate histone H3 at lysine 9 on free histones and mononucleosomes in vitro. This specific histone H3 modification (H3 Me-K9) produced by eukaryotic histone methyltransferases (HMTase), such as SUV39H1, has been shown to recruit HP1 and to create a locally repressive heterochromatic structure (15Neilsen S.J. Schneider R. Bauer U.-M. Bannister A.J. Morrison A. O'Carroll D. Firestein R. Cleary M. Jenuwein T. Herrera R.E. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2001; 412: 561-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The identification of the E2F6-HMTase complex has led to an hypothesis regarding the mechanism of E2F6-mediated transcriptional repression. It has been postulated that the transcriptional repressive activity of E2F6 begins with the recruitment of the Eu-HMTase, which is followed by the methylation of histone H3 at Lys-9, and the subsequent establishment of heterochromatin via recruitment of HP1. However, it has not been rigorously tested whether E2F6 does indeed convert euchromatin into heterochromatin in vivo. As noted above, all of the E2F family members, including E2F6, can bind in vitro to a consensus element (TTTSSCGC). However, it is not yet clear if the same set of target genes will be regulated by all the E2Fs in vivo. Our group has recently utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with CpG island microarrays (ChIP-chip) to identify novel in vivo targets of E2F1, E2F4, pRB, and MYC (16Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 18Mao D.Y.L. Watson J.D. Yan P.S. Barsyte-Lovejoy D. Khosravi F. Wong W.W.-L. Farnham P.J. Huang T.H.-M. Penn L.Z. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 882-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). CpG islands are tracts of at least 200 bp C + G-rich sequences that are found in the promoters and first exons of about 70% of human genes (19Ioshikhes I.P. Zhang M.Q. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 61-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Davuluri R.V. Grosse I. Zhang M.Q. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Because E2F-binding sites are most commonly found within proximal promoter regions and because the consensus binding sequence is GC-rich, the CpG arrays have proved to be very useful for identifying E2F target genes. This present study utilizes an improved version of our previous ChIP-chip protocol to identify genomic targets of E2F6 in human cancer cells. We find that E2F6 regulates genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of neoplasia and in regulating chromatin structure and heredity. We also provide in vivo evidence that E2F6 can repress targets via a mechanism distinct from methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9. Chromatin Immunoprecipitations (ChIP)—The ChIP procedure was performed as described previously (21Oberley M.J. Tsao J. Yau P. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) with HeLa and 293 cells, with the following exceptions (see also mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham). The chromatin was sheared to an average size of 500-2000 bp. After cross-linking reversal and proteinase K digestion, each individual IP was purified with the use of a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and samples were eluted with 30 μl of elution buffer. After elution the IPs were examined by gene-specific PCR on the art27 promoter to ensure that the IP successfully enriched the promoter significantly more than did an IgG control. Antibodies used in the ChIP assays include E2F1 (KH20KH95, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), E2F4 (sc866 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), E2F6 (sc8366X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Max (sc197, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RNA polymerase II (sc-899, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and histone H3 tri-methylated at K9 (Ab8898, Abcam, Cambridge, UK). E2F6 (sc8366P) and TCF4 (sc8631P) peptides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Amplicon Generation and Labeling—For detailed protocols on these steps see Oberley et al. (21Oberley M.J. Tsao J. Yau P. Farnham P.J. Methods Enzymol. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) or mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham. The generation of amplicons from the individual ChIPs was adapted from Ren et al. (20Davuluri R.V. Grosse I. Zhang M.Q. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Briefly, two unidirectional linkers oligoJW102 (5′ gcg gtg acc cgg gag atc tga att c 3′) and oligoJW103 (5′ gaa ttc aga tc 3′) were annealed and blunt-end ligated to the chromatin IPs. Amplicons were created by PCR; each sample consisted of 5 μl of 10× Taq polymerase buffer, 7 μl of 2 mm dNTPs, 3 μl of MgCl2, 6.5 μl of betaine, 2.5 μl of oligoJW102 (20uM), 1 μl of Taq (Promega, M1861), and 25 μl of the blunted and ligated chromatin. PCR was run with one cycle at 55 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 5 min, and 95 °C for 2 min. Twenty cycles were then run at 95 °C for 0.5 min, 55 °C for 0.5 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Finally the products were extended at 72 °C for 4 min and then held at 4 °C until purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was quantitated and stored -20 °C until labeling. The amplicons were labeled with amino-allyl dUTP using 3 × 2 μg of the E2F6 IP amplicon (or 3 × 2 μg of the IgG IP amplicon) and 3 × 2 μg of the total input chromatin amplicon, as described previously (22Yan P.S. Chen C.-M. Shi H. Rahmatpanah F. Wei S.H. Caldwell C.W. Huang T.H.-M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8375-8380PubMed Google Scholar). We coupled the Cy5 dye to the E2F6 IP (or the IgG) amplicon and Cy3 dye to the total reference amplicon, using standard methods (22Yan P.S. Chen C.-M. Shi H. Rahmatpanah F. Wei S.H. Caldwell C.W. Huang T.H.-M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8375-8380PubMed Google Scholar). Unincorporated dye was then removed with a QIAquick PCR kit, eluting with H2O. The labeled chromatin was then dried with heat in a speed-vac and stored dry at -20 °C until ready for hybridization. CpG Island Hybridization—The generation and hybridization of the CpG island microarrays have been described elsewhere (17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 22Yan P.S. Chen C.-M. Shi H. Rahmatpanah F. Wei S.H. Caldwell C.W. Huang T.H.-M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 8375-8380PubMed Google Scholar). The hybridized microarrays were analyzed using the Genepix Pro 4.1 (Axon Instruments) software package. This provided a set of raw values for each feature on each array. Features of poor intensity (<500) and those that had obvious blemishes were manually flagged and removed from the putative positive list. To identify clones that are selectively enriched during IP relative to the starting population, the Cy5 and Cy3 channels were normalized across the entire array, by taking the ratio of the medians for all quality features and normalizing them to unity. After normalization, a ratio was generated that was the intensity in the Cy5 channel minus background divided by the intensity in the Cy3 channel minus background. The ratio was generated for all features that met these criteria, and features with ratios above 2 were selected for further analysis. The identified CpG island clones were then sequenced by standard methods using primers corresponding to vector sequences. PCR Assays—To analyze the identified CpG islands (and other characterized promoter regions), PCRs were performed. Primer sequences for all the ChIP confirmations are available at our website: mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham. Each PCR mixture contained 2 μl of immunoprecipitated DNA (or 10 ng of each amplicon) and was performed as described previously (16Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide intercalation. RNAi Transfections, Westerns, and RT-PCR Assays—293 cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 on 60-mm plates 24 h before transfection with the siRNAs. siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon (Louisville, CO) and included siE2F6-01 (AAGGAUUGUGCUCAGCAGCUG-custom order), siE2F6 smart pool (M-003264-00-05), or siGFP (D-001300-01-05). Transfections were performed with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen) or TransIT-TKO (Mirus, Madison, WI) according to manufacturers' instructions. Western blots were performed as described previously (16Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The same antibodies were used for Westerns as described above for the ChIP assays. RT-PCR analysis was performed as described previously (23Kirmizis A. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 113-121PubMed Google Scholar). Primer sequences for all the RT-PCR assays are available at our website: mcardle.oncology.wisc.edu/farnham. The Identification of E2F6 Genomic Binding Sites Using CpG Microarrays—As noted above, very few bona fide target genes for E2F6 have been identified. In fact, we have found that many well characterized E2F target genes are not bound by E2F6. As an example, we have characterized the binding pattern of the E2Fs on the myc promoter, an established E2F target gene (24Lavia P. Jansen-Durr P. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 25Weinmann A.S. Bartley S.M. Zhang M.Q. Zhang T. Farnham P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6820-6832Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). By using the ChIP assay, we examined binding of E2Fs 1-4 and 6 in human 293 cells. Primers were used that spanned the consensus E2F-binding site, which is located just upstream of the transcriptional start in the myc promoter. The antibodies to E2F1-4 enriched the myc promoter sequences, indicating that the myc promoter is bound by these proteins in asynchronously growing 293 cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast the E2F6 antibody did not enrich the myc promoter sequences relative to the IgG control sample. Given that the myc promoter was occupied by the other E2Fs, the chromatin structure must be permissible to E2F family member binding. Thus, the absence of E2F6 binding suggests that E2F6 likely requires determinants for binding other than the presence of a consensus E2F-binding site. This indicates that E2F6 may bind to only a subset of promoters bound by other E2F family members. Our laboratory has recently utilized chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by CpG microarray analysis (ChIP-chip) to identify genomic targets of E2F4 (17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) and E2F1 (16Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Because of the success of these prior experiments, we reasoned that the ChIP-chip technique would be an excellent method to identify a large set of E2F6 target genes. However, prior to beginning the array experiments, it was essential to have a positive control promoter to ensure specific enrichment of E2F6-bound DNA in the immunoprecipitated chromatin. Therefore, we tested a series of additional E2F target promoters for their ability to bind to E2F6. Examination of well characterized E2F target genes (such as dhfr) revealed that E2F6 did not bind to the promoter regions (data not shown). Because promoters that have consensus E2F-binding sites (such as the myc and dhfr promoters) do not bind E2F6, we next tested promoters that bind E2F family members via non-consensus E2F sites (17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Although the promoter for the art27 (Androgen receptor trapped clone 27) gene, which functions as a coactivator of the androgen receptor (26Markus S.M. Taneja S.S. Logan S.K. Li W. Ha S. Hittelmen A.B. Rogatsky I. Garabedian M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 670-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), does not contain a consensus E2F site (as defined as TTTSSCGC), it does have two near consensus E2F sites located at -280 and -109 relative to the transcriptional start site. We have shown previously that the art27 promoter (which was previously called uxt (27Schroer A. Schneider S. Ropers H. Nothwang H. Genomics. 1999; 56: 340-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) is bound by several E2F family members in HeLa cells (17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). However, binding of E2F6 was not tested in the previous study. We have now demonstrated in vivo binding of E2Fs 1-4 and 6 to the art27 promoter in 293 cells (Fig. 1A). As a negative control, the 3′-untranslated region of the dhfr gene was analyzed. As expected, this region was not enriched by antibodies to any of the E2Fs. Interestingly, E2F6 bound to the art27 promoter in 293 cells but not in HeLa cells (Fig. 1B), despite the fact that E2F6 protein is expressed at significant levels in HeLa cells and that these cells were used to purify the E2F6-containing complex that included the novel Eu-HMTase (10Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). These data indicate that E2F6 shows target gene selectivity and cell type specificity. Because E2F6 has been postulated to be a transcriptional repressor, we compared the activity in 293 cells of art27 promoter constructs containing or lacking the sequences that resemble E2F-binding sites (Fig. 2). We transfected each promoter-luciferase construct into 293 cells, along with a cytomegalovirus-Renilla control for transfection efficiency, harvested the cells after 48 h, and measured the promoter activity. Interestingly, we found that deletion of each E2F-like site resulted in increased activity of the art27 promoter, which suggests that E2F6, perhaps in conjunction with other E2Fs (28Croxton R. Ma Y. Song L. Haura E.B. Cress W.D. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 1359-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), acts to repress the transcriptional activity of the art27 promoter. Based on these studies, we have used 293 cells as an experimental system, and the art27 promoter as our positive control, for the study of E2F6-mediated transcriptional regulation of target genes. Our next step was to perform a high-throughput genomic screen to identify E2F6-binding loci in 293 cells. Our lab has previously screened chromatin immunoprecipitates with CpG island microarrays to identify genomic targets of E2F family members (16Wells J. Yan P.S. Cechvala M. Huang T. Farnham P.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1445-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Weinmann A.S. Yan P.S. Oberley M.J. Huang T.H.-M. Farnham P.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). In our previous studies, multiple individual ChIP samples were pooled to obtain enough material to probe a microarray. Here we have adapted several changes to our previously published protocols that have allowed a more rigorous discrimination of robust in vivo targets (Fig. 3A). One critical change was the inclusion of a ligation-mediated PCR step (29Ren B. Robert F. Wyrick J.J. Aparicio O. Jennings E.G. Simon I. Zeitlinger J. Schreiber J. Hannett N. Kanin E. Volkert T.L. Wilson C.J. Bell S.P. Young R.A. Science. 2000; 290: 2306-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar) that has allowed a considerable reduction in the quantity of cells required. We performed a ChIP assay on 1 × 107 cells with antibodies specific for E2F6 or an IgG control. After extensive washing, the cross-links were reversed, and the DNA was purified. Next, the E2F6 IP, the IgG IP, and 10 ng of total input DNA were blunt-ended, ligated to a unidirectional linker, and amplified to generate enough DNA to probe the CpG microarrays. Equal amounts of amplicons (6 μg of the E2F6 IP and 6 μg of total input) were labeled with amino-allyl dUTP, and then the E2F6 labeled amplicon was conjugated with Cy5, whereas the reference total input amplicon was conjugated with Cy3. These two labeled pools of DNA were mixed with CoT-1 DNA, which binds the repeat DNA in the samples, and applied to a CpG island microarray under stringent hybridization conditions. The arrays were hybridized overnight at 60 °C, washed, and then scanned on an Axon Instrument 4000B scanner, using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments) to analyze the array. After manually flagging any obvious blemishes on the resulting image, all features that gave quality signals were included in a data set that was normalized by setting the ratio of all medians to unity. The results of three array experiments are depicted in Fig. 3B, which is a dot plot on a logarithmic scale where the Cy5 intensity of each feature is plotted on the x axis and the Cy3 intensity of the feature is plotted on the y axis. For the first array hybridization, the total input sample was divided in two; half was labeled with Cy5, and half was labeled with Cy3. These labeled amplicons were then hybridized to an array to give a total versus total comparison (Fig. 3B, red squares). As expected, this plot produced a straight line with a good regression value (R 2 = 0.9468) for spotted arrays. Then, as a negative control, an IgG amplicon was labeled with Cy5 and compared with Cy3-labeled total input chromatin (yellow circles); any CpG-islands that were non-specifically enriched by IgG during the ChIP assay were then discarded from further analysis. Finally, the experimental plot is depicted with blue diamonds, which show the results of hybridization of the E2F6 IP amplicon labeled with Cy5 versus the reference total input amplicon that was labeled with Cy3. As is evident from Fig. 3B, there were many features that displayed enriched Cy5 intensities relative to Cy3, and those that were enriched at least 2-fold over total in independent hybridization experiments were chosen for follow up analysis. After repeating each hybridization twice, there were 77 CpG islands that were specifically enriched at least 2-fold higher than starting input chromatin by the E2F6 ChIP; these were not enriched by IgG in either experiment. The clones from the CpG island library (30Cross S.H. Charlton J.A. Nan X. Bird A.P. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 236-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) that were spotted onto the arrays have not been sequenced, so all putatively positive clones were sequenced and localized in the human genome using the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Web Browser (genome.ucsc.edu). The majority of the sequenced clones (92.2%) were CpG islands located in the promoters and/or first exons of either characterized genes, mRNAs, ESTs, or predicted genes (Fig. 4). Of the remaining six clones, we were unable to sequence five of them, and the final one did not map to any region of the genome using the April 2003 version of the University of California Santa Cruz Genome Web Browser. Because there is some degree of redundancy of the CpG islands spotted on the arrays, the 77 features that were identified as positive in the two independent hybridizations actually represented 48 independent CpG islands. Of these 48 independent CpG islands, 26 were found in the promoter and 5′ region of characterized genes, and 22 were localized to uncharacterized mRNAs, ESTs, or predicted genes. The redundancy on the arrays provided a measure of the robustness of the hybridization procedures. For example, the hp1α locus was identified as an E2F6 target seven times. Fig. 4 shows the identity of the characterized genes, their function, and whether an E2F consensus binding site exists within 1000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Because Ogawa et al. (10Ogawa H. Ishiguro K. Gaubatz S. Livingston D.M. Nakatani Y. Science. 2002; 296: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar) identified E2F6 in a complex with Mga and Max, E2F6 may also be recruited to promoters via E boxes (CACGTG), due to protein-protein interactions with Max-Mga heterodimers. Therefore, the presence or absence of a consensus E box (CCACGTGG) is also indicated. Interestingly, ne"

In this study we describe the pharmacological properties of a novel small molecular weight CCR1 antagonist, CP-481,715 (quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid [4(R)-carbamoyl-1(S)-(3-fluorobenzyl)-2(S),7-dihydroxy-7-methyloctyl]amide). Radiolabeled binding studies indicate that CP-481,715 binds to human CCR1 with a K d of 9.2 nm and displaces 125I-labeled CCL3 from CCR1-transfected cells with an IC50 of 74 nm. CP-481,715 lacks intrinsic agonist activity but fully blocks the ability of CCL3 and CCL5 to stimulate receptor signaling (guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) incorporation; IC50 = 210 nm), calcium mobilization (IC50 = 71 nm), monocyte chemotaxis (IC50 = 55 nm), and matrix metalloproteinase 9 release (IC50 = 54 nm). CP-481,715 retains activity in human whole blood, inhibiting CCL3-induced CD11b up-regulation and actin polymerization (IC50 = 165 and 57 nm, respectively) on monocytes. Furthermore, it behaves as a competitive and reversible antagonist. CP-481,715 is >100-fold selective for CCR1 as compared with a panel of G-protein-coupled receptors including related chemokine receptors. Evidence for its potential use in human disease is suggested by its ability to inhibit 90% of the monocyte chemotactic activity present in 11/15 rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid samples. These data illustrate that CP-481,715 is a potent and selective antagonist for CCR1 with therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases.

These data illustrate that CP-481,715 is a potent and selective antagonist for CCR1 with therapeutic potential for rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting 0.5–2% of the population in the Western world, the majority of whom are female. Central to the pathogenesis of this disease is the infiltration of monocytes into synovial tissue. This is supported by the predominance of monocytes in the joint during flare (1Cutolo M. Sulli A. Barone A. Seriolo B. Accardo S. Clin. Exp. Rheum. 1993; 11: 331-339PubMed Google Scholar, 2Tak P.P. Smeets T.J.M. Daha M.R. Kluin P.M Meijers K.A.E. Brand R. Meinders A.E. Breedveld F.C. Arth.

Joint, Bone, Spine: Revue du Rhumatisme. 2002; 69: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 4Meyer O. Presse Medicale. 2000; 29: 463-468PubMed Google Scholar), and the ability of monocytes to secrete tissue-damaging proteolytic enzymes that participate in joint destruction (5Jenkins J.K. Hardy K.J. McMurray R.W. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2002; 323: 171-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Consequently, an agent that inhibits monocyte infiltration into synovial tissue has the potential to decrease tissue damage and joint destruction, thus, providing a novel therapy for rheumatoid arthritis. Leukocyte infiltration into inflammatory sites is believed to be regulated by small molecular weight cytokines known as chemokines. Chemokines are 7–10-kDa proteins that can be divided into four groups (CC, CXC, CX3C, and C) depending on the spacing of their N-terminal cysteine residues. Approximately 40 different chemokines have been identified. Some of these are constitutively expressed and play a crucial role in development and lymph node architecture. However, most chemokines are specifically induced at inflammatory sites during disease (6Proudfoot A.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Chemokines are of interest as therapeutic targets because they exert their effects through seven-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptors, well precedented drug targets. Although chemokines are best known for their ability to stimulate cell migration, they also have additional activities that can contribute to tissue damage and inflammation including enhancing T cell activation (7Ward S.G. Bacon K. Westwick J. Immunity. 1998; 9: 1-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), regulating TH-1/TH-2 polarization (8Gao J.-L. Wynn T.A. Chang Y. Lee E.J.

In rheumatoid arthritis two chemokines believed to play a major role in regulating monocyte infiltration into synovial tissues are CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein-1α) and CCL5 (RANTES, regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted). CCL3 and CCL5 have potent monocyte chemotactic activity both in vitro (14Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) and in vivo, as demonstrated in human subjects injected intradermally with these agents (15Lee S.C. Brummet M.E. Shahabuddin S.

In these studies, the levels of CCL3 and monocytes in synovial tissue were directly proportional to the magnitude of joint pain (2Tak P.P. Smeets T.J.M. Daha M.R. Kluin P.M Meijers K.A.E. Brand R.

The role of these chemokines in the pathogenesis of arthritis is also supported by human genetic association studies (24Makki R.F. al Sharif F. Gonzalez-Gay M.A. Garcia-Porrua C. Ollier W.E.

The potential importance of CCR1 in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis coupled with the well known success in identifying antagonists of G-protein-coupled receptors prompted us to initiate a search for small molecular weight antagonists of CCR1. These efforts led to the identification of the novel antagonist, CP-481,715. In this study we describe the in vitro biological properties of CP-481,715 and demonstrate its ability to dose-dependently inhibit CCL3- and CCL5-induced chemotaxis, integrin up-regulation, intracellular calcium mobilization, and matrix metalloprotease production. Furthermore, CP-481,715 retains activity in whole blood, and as evidence for its potential therapeutic utility, we demonstrate its ability to inhibit the monocyte chemotactic activity induced by synovial fluid from rheumatoid arthritis patients. These studies suggest that blocking CCR1 may represent a novel therapeutic approach to prevent monocyte infiltration into inflammatory sites such as the synovial tissue. Materials—The CCR1 antagonist CP-481,715 (quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid [4(R)-carbamoyl-1(S)-(3-fluorobenzyl)-2(S),7-dihydroxy-7-methyloctyl]amide; see Fig. 1) and [3H]CP-481,715 were prepared by the Pfizer Medicinal chemistry group. 125I-Labeled CCL3 was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All unlabeled chemokines were obtained from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) unless otherwise indicated and checked for purity by high performance liquid chromatography. Human recombinant interleukin-2 and TNFα were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Reagents—Bovine serum albumin, fluorescein diacetate, and Accuspin™ System-Histopaque-1077 tubes were purchased from Sigma. Heparin was purchased from American Pharmaceutical Partners Inc. (Los Angeles, CA). Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium chloride and magnesium chloride, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and Geneticin were obtained from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was purchased from Hyclone, Logan, Utah. RPMI 1640, HEPES, glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin were all obtained from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Tissue culture medium for cell cultures consisted of RPMI 1640 containing fetal bovine serum (10%), l-glutamine (2 mm), HEPES (10 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Cell Lines—CCR1-transfected HEK 293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were prepared as previously described (28Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). CCR1-, CCR2-, CCR5-, CXCR1-, CXCR2-, and CXCR4-transfected 300-19 cells were obtained from Dr. Israel Charo at the Gladstone Institute. Cells were maintained in Geneticin for selection, split twice weekly, and discarded after passage 12. The human monocytic cell line, THP-1 (ATCC TIB 202), was maintained in RPMI medium and split 24 h before use. Chemokine and CP-481,715 Binding Studies—Binding assays were conducted with CCR1-transfected HEK 293 cells as previously described (28Neote K. DiGregorio D. Mak J.Y. Horuk R. Schall T.J. Cell. 1993; 72: 415-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). The number of CCR1 receptors on the cells was calculated to be 75,000/cell. Cells were typically grown to 80% confluence, removed by trypsinization and plated into flasks at least 48 h before the experiment. On the day of the experiment, cells were collected, washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and resuspended in the assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 2.5 × 105 cells/ml. Cells were then placed into a 96-well plate (25,000 cells/well) and incubated with 50 pm125I-labeled CCL3 or 125I-labeled CCL5 (specific activity 2200 Ci/mmol) in the presence or absence of varying concentrations of CP-481,715 at 4 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by harvesting through a GF/B filter plate (Packard) presoaked with 0.3% polyethyleneimine (Sigma) and washed 3 times with cold wash buffer (10 mm HEPES, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). The radioactivity in each well was determined using a scintillation counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) after the addition of 50 μl of Scint-20 scintillation fluid. Nonspecific binding was assessed in competition studies using unlabeled CCL3 (100 nm). The K d for 125I-labeled CCL3 was calculated to be 3 nm. Similar experiments on CCR1-transfected cells were done using 3H-CP-481,715. Assessment of G-protein Signaling Using [35]GTPγS Incorporation— THP-1 cells were freeze-thawed three times to create membranes that were then utilized for the assay. 100 nm CCL3 was added to 100 μg of the membrane preparation in the presence of various concentrations of CP-481,715 and 10 mm GDP. [35S]GTPγS incorporation was measured using an SPA assay (Amersham Bioscience). To assess the potential for inverse agonist activity, GTPγS incorporation was also measured on membranes in the presence of CP-481,715 without added CCL3. Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)— Human blood was collected from normal volunteers in heparinized syringes (30 units/ml) and then immediately transferred to Accuspin tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g. PBMCs were collected from the interface and washed twice with PBS. Any remaining red blood cells were removed by hypotonic lysis. Cells were then subjected to slow speed centrifugation (100 × g) to remove any platelets. Chemotaxis Assays—PBMC chemotaxis was conducted in 48-well chemotaxis chambers purchased from NeuroProbe, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD) as previously described (29Cole K.E. Strick C.A. Paradis T.J. Ogborne K.T. Loetscher M. Gladue R.P. Lin W. Boyd J.G. Moser B. Wood D.E. Sahagan B.G. Neote K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 2009-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Briefly, agonists were diluted in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin then added to the bottom wells of the chamber. A polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filter with 5-μm pores (Neuroprobe) was placed between the upper and lower wells of the chamber. PBMCs were then added to the top chamber (2 × 105) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of CP-481,715, and the apparatus was incubated for 60 min in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the non-migrating cells were removed from the upper chamber, and the top of the filter was wiped. The bottom portion of the filter was stained with Diff-Quik (Dade Behring, Newark, DE), and the number of migrating cells in six random fields were enumerated with a microscope. A similar procedure was employed for THP-1 cells except a 96-well chemotaxis chamber was utilized, 8 × 105 cells were added to the upper wells, and the chamber was incubated for 3 h rather than 60 min. In this case, after incubation and the removal of non-migrating cells as above, 2 mm cold EDTA was added to the upper wells, and the chemotaxis chamber was incubated at 4 °C for 20 min. The EDTA was then removed, and the 96-well microtiter plate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The filter was then removed, the culture medium was discarded, and 0.2% fluorescein diacetate was added to the plates. The plates were then incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C until a yellow color developed. The number of migrating cells was quantitated by reading the intensity of the color on a microtiter plate reader at 490 nm. Calcium Measurements—Human CCR1-transfected 300-19 cells were harvested, centrifuged, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1.6 mm CaCl2. The cells were loaded with indo-1 AM (2 μm; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and then washed twice with buffer and suspended at 1 × 107/ml. Calcium mobilization was assessed using a fluorometer (Photon Technology Corp. International, Lawrenceville, NJ) after the addition of CP-481,715 or diluent and CCL3 or CCL5. Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) Generation—PBMCs were placed in 24-well plates (VWR, Boston, MA) at 2 × 106/ml in tissue culture medium. 20 nm CCL5 or 10 ng/ml TNFα was then added to the cells in the presence or absence of various concentrations of CP-481,715. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and centrifuged, and the concentration of MMP9 in the supernatants was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Whole Blood Monocyte CD11b Up-regulation—CD11b up-regulation on monocytes in human whole blood was assessed as previously described (30Conklyn M.J. Neote K. Showell H.J. Cytokine. 1996; 8: 762-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood samples were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of various concentrations of CP-481,715. CCL3 was then added to the blood at various concentrations. After 15 min, the assay tubes were placed in an ice-water bath to stop the reaction. Cells were then washed by adding 1 ml of PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.2% sodium azide (wash solution). The cells were then pelleted at 200 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. CD11b expression on CD14+ monocytes was then determined by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Whole Blood Actin Polymerization—Human blood collected in EDTA was incubated with various dilutions of CP-481,715 or diluent for 5 min at room temperature. CCL3 (10 nm) was then added, and after 50 s the reaction was terminated by adding fluorescence-activated cell sorter lysing solution (BD Biosciences) containing paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA). After 10 min, the cells were collected by centrifugation, washed with PBS, and stained for 1 h at room temperature in the dark with a solution containing lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma), paraformaldehyde, and N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)) phallacidin (Molecular Probes). The cells were then washed with PBS containing 2% fetal calf serum, and the fluorescence was quantitated using a FACScan (BD Biosciences). Identification of CP-481,715 and Characterization of Its Effects on CCR1 Using Binding Assays—A binding assay using CCR1-transfected HEK 293 cells was used to screen our compound library for small molecular weight compounds that inhibit CCL3 binding to CCR1. Chemical optimization of active compounds from this screen led to the identification of quinoxaline-2-carboxylic acid [4(R)-carbamoyl-1(S)-(3-fluorobenzyl)-2(S)-7-dihydroxy-7-methyloctyl] amide (CP-481,715) as the lead compound (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 2A, competition binding experiments demonstrated that CP-481,715 displaces 125I-labeled CCL3 from CCR1-transfected HEK 293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 74 nm). Similar results were observed with 125I-labeled CCL5 (data not shown). To better define its interaction, competition binding experiments were also conducted with radiolabeled CP-481,715. As shown in Fig. 2B, [3H]CP-481,715 binds to human CCR1-expressing HEK 293 cells with a K d of 9.2 nm. These data demonstrate that CP-481,715 binds to human CCR1 and prevents its interaction with CCL3. CP-481,715 Inhibits GTP Hydrolysis—Because interaction with the CCR1 receptor could impart both agonist and/or antagonist properties, we next sought to characterize this interaction from a functional perspective. During receptor activation, GDP bound to the α subunit of G-protein receptors is released, leading to the rapid binding of GTP and the subsequent dissociation of β/γ subunits. The release of these β/γ subunits initiates a cascade of intracellular events (i.e. calcium mobilization, adenylate cyclase activation, etc.) culminating in the hydrolysis of GTP to return the receptor to its resting state. The initial step in G-protein signaling can be quantitated by measuring the incorporation of the non-hydrolyzable form of GTP, [35S]GTPγS. As shown in Fig. 3, THP-1 cells had a basal level of receptor activity (35S-GTP) that was not significantly affected by CP-481,715, indicating that CP-481,715 was not acting as an inverse agonist (31Barr A.J. Manning D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32979-32987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, CP-481,715 was able to block CCL3 (100 nm)-induced [35S]GTPγS incorporation in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of 210 nm). CP-481,715 Inhibits Calcium Mobilization but Has No Agonist Properties—We next characterized the effects of CP-481,715 on CCR1 function by measuring intracellular calcium mobilization in CCR1-transfected 300-19 cells. In these studies CP-481,715 did not directly induce calcium mobilization, supporting its lack of intrinsic agonist activity (data not shown). In contrast, as shown in Fig. 4, calcium mobilization induced by CCL3 was blocked by CP-481,715 in a concentration-dependent manner. The amount of CP-481,715 necessary to block this effect was directly proportional to the concentration of CCL3 utilized, demonstrating a 5–6-fold change in IC50 with each log change in CCL3 concentration. This data suggest that CP-481,715 is a competitive antagonist of CCR1. To provide evidence that CP-481,715 was not acting nonspecifically (e.g. by inhibiting downstream signaling), we performed experiments on THP-1 monocytes that express both CCR1 and CCR2. As shown in Fig. 5A, calcium mobilization was induced by THP-1 cells using either CCL3 or CCL2. CP-481,715 was able to inhibit CCL3- but not CCL2-induced intracellular calcium mobilization (Fig. 5B). Again, CP-481,715 did not directly induce any calcium mobilization on THP-1 cells. To further establish that the inhibitory effects of CP-481,715 were mediated through direct interaction with CCR1 and not through effects on its ligands, we also measured calcium mobilization on CCR5-transfected cells because both CCL3 and CCL5 also interact with this receptor. CP-481,715 did not inhibit calcium mobilization in CCR5 transfected cells in response to either ligand (data not shown). Collectively, these studies indicate that CP-481,715 completely antagonizes the CCR1 receptor, lacks intrinsic agonist activity, does not directly interfere with its ligands, and does not antagonize CCR5 or CCR2. CP-481,715 Inhibits Leukocyte Chemotaxis—A major property of chemokines is their ability to induce leukocyte migration and mediate the infiltration of these cells into sites of inflammation. As such, to better characterize the activity of CP-481,715 on CCR1 in a way that may be more relevant for disease, we performed a series of experiments examining the effects of CP-481,715 on chemotaxis. As shown in Fig. 6, CP-481,715 inhibited the chemotaxis of THP-1 cells and human peripheral blood monocytes to an optimal concentration of CCL3 (1.0 nm) with an IC50 of 110 and 55 nm, respectively. CP-481,715 also inhibited the chemotaxis of monocytes to other CCR1 ligands, including CCL5 and CCL14, and was able to partially inhibit the response to the shared ligand CCL7, which interacts with both CCR1 and CCR2 on monocytes (data not shown). Concentrations of CP-481,715 up to 25 μm did not inhibit the chemotaxis of THP-1 or primary human monocytes in response to the CCR2 ligand, CCL2, indicating that CP-481,715 did not exert nonspecific effects on cells that would generally interfere with migration. Because calcium mobilization studies demonstrated a proportional relationship between the amount of CP-481,715 necessary to inhibit activity and the concentration of CCL3, we next determined whether the same effects were observed on chemotaxis. As shown in Fig. 7, the concentration of CP-481,715 necessary to inhibit 50, 75, or 90% of the chemotactic response to CCL3 was directly dependent on the amount of agonist used to stimulate the response. For example, the IC50 for CP-481,715 was 5, 16, and 66 nm using CCL3 concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 nm, respectively. Similar results were also observed when CCL5 was used as the agonist (data not shown). These studies further suggest that CP-481,715 is a competitive antagonist of CCR1. An important property for a receptor antagonist is reversibility. Non-reversibility could imply a covalent interaction of the antagonist with the receptor which, in long term use in patients, could lead to immunogenicity. To determine whether the effects of CP-481,715 were reversible, we exposed THP-1 cells to various concentrations of CP-481,715 (up to 10 μm) for 30 min. As expected, the migration of these cells was totally inhibited in response to CCL3. However washing CP-481,715-exposed cells restored their ability to respond to CCL3 (data not shown), indicating that the effects of CP-481,715 on CCR1 are fully reversible. Selectivity of CP-481,715 for CCR1—CP-481,715 was evaluated against a panel of G-protein-coupled receptors using binding assays (Table I). In all cases, <10% inhibitory activity was observed at a concentration of 3 μm. Furthermore, drug concentrations as high as 25 μm did not inhibit receptor binding of the appropriate ligand to cells expressing CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR1, and CXCR2, and did not inhibit the chemotaxis of human cells to the chemokines CCL2, CCL27, CCL20, CCL19, CXCL8, CXCL11, and CXCL12 (data not shown). These results indicate that CP-481,715 is >100-fold selective for CCR1. In addition to its selectivity as compared with other receptors, CP-481,715 is also selective for the human receptor and does not inhibit the effects of CCL3 on mouse, rat, guinea pig, dog, rabbit, or monkey leukocytes as demonstrated with binding, chemotaxis, and whole blood studies at concentrations up to 25 μm (data not shown).Table IPanel of G-protein-coupled receptors evaluated for activity with CP-481,715 GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; AMPA, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid; NMDA, N-methyl-d-asparate; PAF, platlet-activating factor.ClassReceptor evaluatedAdenosineA1, A2A, A3Adrenergicα1, non-selective, α2, non-selective, β1, β2Angiotensin IIAT1, AT2BradykininB1, B2DopamineD1, D2, D3, D4.4GABANon-selectiveGlutamateAMPA, Kainate, NMDAHistamineH1, central, H2, H3MelanocortinMC4MuscarinicM1, M2, M3, M4NeurokininNK1NicotinicNeuronal, muscle-typeOpiateδ, κ, μPlatelet-activating factorPAFSerotonin5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT7 Open table in a new tab Effects of CP-481,715 on CCL3-mediated CD11b Up-regulation in Human Whole Blood—A crucial attribute for therapeutic agents is their ability to retain activity in the presence of high protein concentrations. This may be especially true for chemokine receptor antagonists since the cells migrating into inflammatory sites in response to a chemotactic gradient would come from the peripheral blood. To address this, we measured two components of CCR1 activity, integrin up-regulation and cytoskeletal rearrangement in whole blood. The up-regulation of integrins, such as CD11b, mediate the firm adherence of leukocytes to the endothelium, a prerequisite to cell infiltration. As shown in Fig. 8, CP-481,715 dose-dependently inhibited CD11b up-regulation on monocytes in human blood (average IC50 from 10 different donors = 160 nm). As an alternative assessment of whole blood activity that may be more indicative of cell migration, we also measured actin polymerization on monocytes in response to CCL3. CP-481,715 also inhibited CCL3-induced actin polymerization in human blood with an IC50 of 58 nm (Fig. 8).

Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a bioactive lipid mediator produced by platelets and found in the blood and atherosclerotic plaques. LPA receptors on platelets, leukocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells regulate growth, differentiation, survival, motility, and contractile activity. Definition of the opposing pathways of synthesis and degradation that control extracellular LPA levels is critical to understanding how LPA bioactivity is regulated. We show that intact platelets and platelet membranes actively dephosphorylate LPA and identify the major enzyme responsible as lipid phosphate phosphatase 1 (LPP1). Localization of LPP1 to the platelet surface is increased by exposure to LPA. A novel receptor-inactive sn-3-substituted difluoromethylenephosphonate analog of phosphatidic acid that is a potent competitive inhibitor of LPP1 activity potentiates platelet aggregation and shape change responses to LPA and amplifies LPA production by agonist-stimulated platelets. Our results identify LPP1 as a pivotal regulator of LPA signaling in the cardiovascular system. These findings are consistent with genetic and cell biological evidence implicating LPPs as negative regulators of lysophospholipid signaling and suggest that the mechanisms involve both attenuation of lysophospholipid actions at cell surface receptors and opposition of lysophospholipid production.

LPA and the structurally related compound sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are present in biological fluids at physiologically relevant concentrations and exert many of their effects on target cells by binding to specific heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled cell surface receptors. Responses to stimulation with LPA and S1P include growth, differentiation, chemotaxis, smooth muscle contraction, and changes in cell morphology and motility through alterations in organization of the actin cytoskeleton (1Hla T.

Blood plasma contains physiologically relevant levels of LPA (4Baker D.L. Desiderio D.M. Miller D.D. Tolley B. Tigyi G.J. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 292: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Because of the multiple actions of LPA on cells of the vasculature, a growing body of evidence suggests that LPA plays an important role in blood clotting, wound healing, and tissue regeneration (3Tigyi G. Prostaglandins. 2001; 64: 47-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mitogenic and chemotactic actions of LPA may also participate in the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages and aberrant stimulation of endothelial and vascular muscle cell growth that underlie intimal hyperplasia, formation of an atherosclerotic plaque, and progression of atherosclerosis (5Siess W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1582: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Elevated plasma levels of LPA have also been associated with ovarian and certain other gynecological cancers, where LPA may participate in autocrine or paracrine stimulation of tumor cell growth (6Tanyi J.L. Morris A.J. Wolf J.K. Fang X. Hasegawa Y. Lapushin R. Auersperg N. Sigal Y.J. Newman R.A. Felix E.A. Atkinson E.N. Mills G.B. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1073-1082PubMed Google Scholar). LPA is a major growth factor in serum where it is produced by pathways that are initiated by platelet activation. Platelets also appear to play a central role in the production of LPA in the blood (7Gerrard J.M. Robinson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1001: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8Eichholtz T. Jalink K. Fahrenfort I. Moolenaar W.H. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 677-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). One pathway for LPA synthesis involves the actions of a secretory phospholipase A2 on phosphatidic acid (PA)-enriched membrane microparticles that are released from activated platelets (9Fourcade O.

Another pathway involves formation of lysophosphatidylcholine by lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase or release of this lipid by platelets and other blood cells, which is then converted to LPA by the lysophosphatidylcholine-selective lysophospholipase D activity of autotaxin (10Sano T.

When in the plasma membrane, the active sites of these enzymes are oriented toward the extracellular space (18Roberts R. Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol.

Here we show that a specific LPP isoform, LPP1, is strongly expressed in platelets and that its localization and activity are regulated by platelet agonists. Newly synthesized chemical inhibitors identify LPP1 as a global regulator of LPA production and signaling in platelets.

Isolation of Human Platelets and Microvesicles—Blood was collected from healthy aspirin-free donors, and platelet-rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation. For most experiments, platelets were separated from citrated plasma by gel-filtration through Sepharose 2B in Tyrode's buffer (138 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 12 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 0.35% BSA, 0.1% glucose, pH 7.4). Aggregation of gel-filtered platelets (1–3 × 108/ml) was performed as previously described (33Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). For isolation of microvesicles, platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 and incubated with 19 μm A23187 and 100 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 37 °C for 30 min. Intact platelets were sedimented at 2000 × g for 20 min at room temperature, and microvesicles were recovered by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Antibodies—A peptide corresponding to residues 254–267 (FFKERTSFKERKE) of the sequence of human LPP1 was synthesized and used as a conjugated antigen for production of an affinity-purified rabbit antibody using the procedure previously described for the LPP3 antibody (20Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Surface-labeling Platelets with Biotin—Washed platelets were suspended in Tyrode's buffer at 5 × 108/ml and then mixed with an equal volume of Sulfo-N-Hydroxysuccimido-biotin (1 mg/ml) in Tyrode's buffer. The mixture was incubated at room temperature with constant rocking for 30 min. Platelets were washed twice with Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm glycine and then suspended in buffer A and 2% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with constant rocking. The material was centrifuged at 25,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was mixed with ∼8 units of avidin-Sepharose and rocked at 4 °C for 1h. The resin was sedimented by gentle centrifugation and washed six times by resuspension in ∼100 volumes of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 2% Triton X-100. The avidin-Sepharose was resuspended in lysis buffer for determination of LPA phosphatase activity or boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis of proteins by Western blotting. Sucrose Density Gradient Fractionation—Outdated platelets were washed and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation as previously described (33Coller B.S. Peerschke E.I. Scudder L.E. Sullivan C.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). A stepwise sucrose gradient (from 0.8 to 2.0 m sucrose in increments of 0.2 m) was used to subfractionate the platelet lysate. The platelet lysate was layered on top of the gradient and centrifuged at 100,000 × g and 4 °C for 60 min in a SW-41 rotor (Beckman Instruments; Palo Alto, CA). A volume containing 30 μg of the indicated fractions was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The relative concentrations of the well-characterized platelet membrane proteins GPIIIa, α-granule P-selectin, and LPP1 were determined by immunoblotting and scanning densitometry. Enzymatic Deglycosylation—Proteins were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation using previously described procedures or modifications of procedures provided by the manufacturer (20Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The enzymes used were obtained from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA. Fluorescence Microscopy—Fibrinogen (100 μg/ml) was immobilized on Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Rochester, NY) overnight at 4 °C, and nonspecific sites were blocked with BSA. Gel-filtered platelets (25,000–50,000/ml in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 mm MgCl2) were incubated with the fibrinogen-coated slides in the absence or presence of 10 μm ADP or 1 μm LPA for 30 min at room temperature (∼22 °C). The wells were washed by inversion, and the adherent platelets were stained for 30 min at RT with either monoclonal antibody 10E5 against αIIbβ3 or monoclonal antibody 6F1 against α2β1, or control antibody (34Broekman M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Platelets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at RT and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at RT. After washing, the fixed, permeabilized platelets were incubated in the dark with TRITC-phalloidin (0.025 μg/ml in PBS, Sigma Chemical Co.) antibodies specific for LPP1 or LPP3 and the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody. Slides were mounted with Prolong AntiFade (Molecular Probes) and examined with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope. Digital images were captured and scored by a blinded reviewer for the number of adherent platelets/high power field and the percentage of spread platelets/high power field. Spread platelets were identified by TRITC-phalloidin staining of actin fibers. Rho Activation Assays—Platelets were incubated in 100-mm diameter dishes that had been coated with 100 μg/ml fibrinogen as described above. Rho activation was measured using a rhotekin binding assay (Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. Total and active Rho were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting of total lysate and rhotekin-bound proteins, respectively, and quantitated by scanning densitometry. Measurement of LPA Production by Platelets—LPA production by washed platelets was determined using minor modifications of a recently published procedure (10Sano T. Baker D. Virag T. Wada A. Yatomi Y. Kobayashi T. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21197-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In brief, gel-filtered platelets were washed and then resuspended in phosphate-free Tyrode's buffer containing 2 mCi of [ 32P]PO42- and 1 μm prostaglandin E1 at 2 × 109 platelets/ml. The platelet suspension was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Platelets were sedimented by gentle centrifugation, the labeling medium was removed, and the platelets were washed twice in Tyrode's buffer containing 1 μm prostaglandin E1 before resuspension in this buffer to a final density of 2 × 108 platelets/ml. 0.5-ml incubations were initiated by combining 0.25 ml of platelet suspension with 0.25 ml of Tyrode's buffer supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2 and containing combinations of 10 μm TRAP (thrombin receptor-activating peptide SFLLRN) with 10 μm XY-14. 37 °C incubations in a gently shaking water bath were terminated by microcentrifugation. Lipids were extracted from the supernatant and separated by thin layer chromatography as described (10Sano T. Baker D. Virag T. Wada A. Yatomi Y. Kobayashi T. Igarashi Y. Tigyi G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21197-21206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). [32P]LPA was identified by co-migration with a radiolabeled standard run in parallel and quantitated using a STORM PhosphorImager system. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated and, where appropriate, analyzed by Student t test. Characterization of LPP Activities in Intact Platelets and Platelet-derived Fractions—When gel-filtered human platelets were incubated with 10 μm [32P]oleyl-LPA in a final concentration of 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA, we observed rapid time-dependent release of ammonium molybdate-extractable [ 32P]PO42-, which occurred without significant uptake of the substrate by the platelets. When this experiment was repeated using a mixture of [32P]oleyl-LPA and oleyl-LPA that was labeled with 3H in the acyl chain, we found that greater than 95% LPA was converted to a stoichiometric mixture of monoacylglycerol and PO42- and that the kinetics of accumulation of these products were identical. Taken together, these results show that intact platelets contain a surface phosphatase that actively dephosphorylates LPA to generate the receptor-inactive molecule monoacylglycerol. To probe the substrate specificity of this phosphatase activity, we examined dephosphorylation of LPA, PA, and S1P by intact platelets, platelets that had been disrupted by brief probe sonication, and platelet-derived membrane microvesicles. Intact platelets dephosphorylated all three substrates, and the rate of dephosphorylation of LPA was approximately four times greater than that observed with PA and six times greater than observed with S1P. When platelets were disrupted by sonication, the rate of dephosphorylation of LPA was approximately doubled suggesting that most of the activity responsible was at the platelet surface. The microvesicle preparations contained ∼20% of the LPA phosphatase activity of the platelets from which they were derived (Table I). Using mixed substrate and Triton X-100 micelles, we found that LPA, PA, and S1P phosphatase activities were predominantly membrane-associated in platelets, were stimulated by Triton X-100, were independent of Mg2+, and were insensitive to inhibition by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), all of which are characteristic properties of the LPP enzymes (14Brindley D.N.

Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We raised an antibody against LPP1 by immunization of rabbits with a peptide corresponding to a unique internal sequence (Fig. 1A). This antibody selectively recognizes LPP1 expressed in sf9 cells using a baculovirus vector in Western blots (Fig. 1B) and efficiently immunoprecipitates LPP1 but not LPP2 or LPP3 activity from detergent extracts of membranes from insect cells infected with these vectors (Fig. 1C). Detergent extracts from platelet membranes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation using the LPP1 and LPP3 antibodies. Although immunoprecipitation using an irrelevant control antibody resulted in no loss of LPP activity from the extracts, immunoprecipitation with the LPP1 antibody resulted in depletion of 87 ± 0 3.1% of LPP activity. By contrast, immunoprecipitation with the LPP3 antibody depleted only 4.5 ± 0.7% of the activity (means ± S.D., n = 3). In agreement with these findings, LPA phosphatase activity in the immune complexes from the LPP1 immunoprecipitation was ∼16-fold higher than that recovered after immunoprecipitation with the LPP3 antibody (Fig. 1D). Western blot analysis of detergent extracts of platelet membranes using the LPP1 antibody described above detected a strongly reacting protein species with a molecular mass of ∼34 kDa and a less abundant species with a molecular mass of ∼31 kDa. LPPs are extremely hydrophobic and it is likely that the minor immunoreactive species with higher molecular weight represent aggregated forms of the proteins. Human LPP1 has a predicted molecular mass of 31.9 kDa. All LPP isoforms contain a single functional consensus glycosylation sequence in the loop between transmembrane regions three and four. Glycosylated LPPs have been shown to be sensitive to treatment with N-glycanase and sialidase (14Brindley D.N. Waggoner D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24281-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 20Sciorra V.A. Morris A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3863-3876Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We found that treatment of samples with N-gycosidase F increased electrophoretic mobility of the ∼34-kDa species, but no increase in mobility was observed when samples were treated with endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, α2–3,6,8,9-neuraminidase, β1,4-galactosidase, or β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. These results suggest that platelet LPP1 is modified by N-linked glycosylation. Mobility of the less abundant immunoreactive species was unaltered by these treatments, so this may represent a nonglycosylated form of the protein (Fig. 1E). We detected a less abundant ∼35-kDa immunoreactive protein when platelet membrane extracts were probed using an LPP3-specific antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that LPP1 accounts for the major LPP activity in human platelets and platelets also express LPP3 at a much lower level (Fig. 1F). Distinct Localization Patterns of LPP1 and LPP3 in Resting and LPA-stimulated Adherent Platelets—We used indirect immunofluorescence to examine the distribution of LPP1 in fixed platelets adherent to fibrinogen. These experiments revealed that in unstimulated platelets LPP1 localized to the platelet surface and possibly also intracellular membrane structures. Stimulation of platelets with LPA resulted in dramatic platelet spreading, which was accompanied by concomitant expansion of LPP1 distribution across the platelet surface (Fig. 2, A and B). LPP1 was not distributed evenly in resting or stimulated platelets but displayed a punctate localization pattern. LPP1 localization was distinct from that of two other platelet surface proteins αIIbβ3 and α2β1 (not shown, but see Fig. 2, C–E). Similar changes in LPP distribution were observed when platelets were stimulated with the thrombin receptor-activating peptide TRAP or with ADP (not shown). Unexpectedly, staining platelets with the LPP3 antibody revealed that the apparently low levels of expression of this LPP isoform observed by Western blotting arise not from uniformly low expression in the entire platelet population but because LPP3 is strongly expressed in ∼5% of the platelets (Fig. 2, C and D). In LPA-activated platelets, LPP3 localized both to the center of the platelet and to the platelet periphery. Interestingly, the localization pattern of LPP3 was very similar to that of αIIbβ3 (Fig. 2E). LPP3 has recently been noted to contain an RGD sequence that interacts with β3 integrins and was therefore postulated to function in cell-cell interactions (26Humtsoe J.O. Feng S. Thakker G.D.

https://openalex.org/W2097507625,"Together, RecQ helicase and topoisomerase III (Topo III) of Escherichia coli comprise a potent DNA strand passage activity that can catenate covalently closed DNA (Harmon, F. G., DiGate, R. J., and Kowalczykowski, S. C. (1999) Mol. Cell 3, 611-620). Here we directly assessed the structure of the catenated DNA species formed by RecQ helicase and Topo III using atomic force microscopy. The images show complex catenated DNA species involving crossovers between multiple double-stranded DNA molecules that are consistent with full catenanes. E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein significantly stimulated both the topoisomerase activity of Topo III alone and the DNA strand passage activity of RecQ helicase and Topo III. Titration data suggest that an intermediate of the RecQ helicase unwinding process, perhaps a RecQ helicase-DNA fork, is the target for Topo III action. Catenated DNA is the predominant product under conditions of molecular crowding; however, we also discovered that RecQ helicase and single-stranded DNA-binding protein greatly stimulated the intramolecular strand passage (“supercoiling”) activity of Topo III, as revealed by changes in the linking number of uncatenated DNA. Together our results demonstrate that RecQ helicase and Topo III function together to comprise a potent and concerted single-strand DNA passage activity that can mediate both catenation-decatenation processes and changes in DNA topology. Together, RecQ helicase and topoisomerase III (Topo III) of Escherichia coli comprise a potent DNA strand passage activity that can catenate covalently closed DNA (Harmon, F. G., DiGate, R.

Together our results demonstrate that RecQ helicase and Topo III function together to comprise a potent and concerted single-strand DNA passage activity that can mediate both catenation-decatenation processes and changes in DNA topology. The RecQ family of proteins is a large and important class of DNA helicases (for review, see Ref. 1Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Members of this helicase family are widespread, having been identified in bacteria (RecQ) (2Irino N. Nakayama K. Nakayama H. Mol.

Koonin E.V. Donchenko A.P. Blinov V.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar), and they possess many common biochemical attributes (14Umezu K. Nakayama K.

Because of the association of mutations in several of these proteins with human diseases, understanding the role of these RecQ-like helicases in DNA metabolism is likely to provide an important understanding of the molecular basis of these diseases. Null mutations in the WRN helicase are implicated in Werner's syndrome, the major clinical manifestation of which is premature aging and a predisposition to cancer (10Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Loss of BLM helicase function results in Bloom's syndrome; in this case, afflicted individuals are highly susceptible to certain types of cancer (15Gray M.D. Shen J.C. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Blank A. Sopher B.L. Martin G.M. Oshima J. Loeb L.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 100-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Mutations in the RECQ4 helicase are found in a subset of Rothmund-Thompson syndrome cases, a disease that is also typified by a predisposition to malignancy (12Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Goto M. Miller R.W. Smithson W.A. Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 18Lindor N.M. Furuichi Y. Kitao S. Shimamoto A. Arndt C. Jalal S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 90: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Phenotypic analysis indicates that these helicases are needed in their respective organisms to maintain the stability of the genome (for review, see Ref. 19Chakraverty R.K. Hickson I.D. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 286-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For example, human cells lacking BLM helicase function display elevated levels of sister chromatid exchange (20German J. Medicine. 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). Similarly, gross chromosomal rearrangements and breakage are common phenotypes of human cells lacking WRN helicase function. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, SGS1 mutation leads to genetic instability at the rDNA locus, which results in premature aging in this organism (3Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 21Sinclair D.A. Mills K. Guarente L.

Sci. 1998; 23: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of the Rqh1 helicase in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe leads to an increased incidence of chromosome nondisjunction and elevated levels of recombination following DNA damage (5Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a null mutation at the recQ locus, which encodes the RecQ helicase from Escherichia coli, results in a 30-fold increase in illegitimate recombination (23Hanada K. Ukita T. Kohno Y. Saito K. Kato J. Ikeda H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3860-3865Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Genomic stability in many organisms also appears to require the function of a Topo III 1The abbreviations used are: Topo III, topoisomerase III; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AFM, atomic force microscopy; scDNA, supercoiled DNA; rcDNA, relaxed, covalently closed DNA; PEG, polyethylene glycol; hdDNA, heat-denatured, relaxed, covalently closed DNA; K eff, effective concentration of protein required to reach half the maximal rate of catenation; Topo I, topoisomerase I; wgTopo I, wheat germ topoisomerase I; ΔLk, linking number difference from relaxed DNA; scDNA, supercoiled DNA; SSB protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).1The abbreviations used are: Topo III, topoisomerase III; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; AFM, atomic force microscopy; scDNA, supercoiled DNA; rcDNA, relaxed, covalently closed DNA; PEG, polyethylene glycol; hdDNA, heat-denatured, relaxed, covalently closed DNA; K eff, effective concentration of protein required to reach half the maximal rate of catenation; Topo I, topoisomerase I; wgTopo I, wheat germ topoisomerase I; ΔLk, linking number difference from relaxed DNA; scDNA, supercoiled DNA; SSB protein, single-stranded DNA-binding protein; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate).-like enzyme. Similar to the RecQ family of helicases, these topoisomerases are highly conserved, with structural homologues identified in humans (24Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 25Ng S.W. Liu Y. Hasselblatt K.T. Mok S.C. Berkowitz R.S.

Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and bacteria (28DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An indication of their importance in DNA metabolism is reflected in the fact that mammalian cells possess two distinct isoforms of Topo III, hTopo IIIα and hTopo IIIβ. Furthermore, a null mutation in mouse Topo IIIα is embryonically lethal (26Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Additionally, loss of Topo III function in S. pombe leads to aberrant mitotic chromosome segregation, and these effects are ultimately lethal (29Goodwin A. Wang S.W. Toda T. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 30Maftahi M. Han C. Langston L.D. Hope J.C. Zigouras N. Freyer G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4715-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, top3 mutants display elevated levels of homologous recombination between short repeated DNA sequences (27Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Similarly, loss of Topo III function in E. coli results in an increase in deletions arising from recombination events between direct repeats (31Whoriskey S.K. Schofield M.A. Miller J.H. Genetics. 1991; 127: 21-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Schofield M.A. Agbunag R. Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5168-5170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of the E. coli and S. cerevisiae proteins revealed that these topoisomerases also share several common biochemical attributes. Both the yeast and bacterial proteins are type 1A topoisomerases (i.e. binding and strand cleavage is limited to one strand); therefore, each displays a distinct preference for acting on DNA substrates having regions of ssDNA (33DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kim R.A. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17178-17185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another common attribute of Topo III-like enzymes is that they more readily catenate/decatenate DNA molecules that possess ssDNA regions, whereas they remove supercoils from fully duplex DNA molecules slowly. An emerging paradigm for the RecQ-like helicases is that their role in DNA metabolism requires a specific interaction between the helicase and a Topo III-like topoisomerase. This unusual functional pairing of proteins was first identified in S. cerevisiae, where a mutation in SGS1 was found to suppress the hyper-recombination phenotype of top3 mutants (3Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In addition, epistasis analysis also indicated that TOP3 and SGS1 act in the same pathway. This was supported by the fact that Sgs1 physically interacts with yeast Topo III (3Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 35Bennett R.J. Noirot-Gros M.-F. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26898-26905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S. pombe Rqh1 helicase and its cognate Topo III also share a genetic interaction, because a rqh1 deletion suppresses the lethal phenotype of a TOP3 mutation (29Goodwin A. Wang S.W. Toda T. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4050-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the human BLM helicase physically interacts with hTopo IIIα (36Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H. Riou J.F. Turley H. Gatter K.C. Hickson I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9636-9644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and, in a heterologous eukaryotic system, yeast Sgs1 helicase interacts with hTopo IIIβ (25Ng S.W. Liu Y. Hasselblatt K.T. Mok S.C. Berkowitz R.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, the coupling of helicase and topoisomerase function was also identified in bacteria; E. coli RecQ helicase functionally interacts with E. coli Topo III in vitro, and a similar behavior was also observed for RecQ helicase and Topo III from S. cerevisiae (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These findings were consistent with this being a conserved activity of RecQ-like helicases and Topo III-like topoisomerases, The biochemical consequences of these interactions are largely unknown, except in the case of E. coli Topo III and RecQ helicase. Acting together, these two proteins exhibit a potent duplex DNA strand passage activity that is absent in either of the individual proteins. The DNA strand passage activity possessed by this combination of proteins is unique in that it permits Topo III to catenate and decatenate covalently closed duplex DNA (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Recent work has also demonstrated that BLM helicase (in conjunction with human RPA) significantly stimulates the DNA strand passage activity of hTopo III (38Wu L. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4823-4829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we further characterized the DNA strand passage activity of RecQ helicase and Topo III with respect to the effects of ssDNA-binding proteins, the concentration of both RecQ helicase and Topo III, and the effect of macromolecular crowding. Furthermore, the structure of the catenated DNA produced by RecQ helicase and Topo III was visualized using AFM. We discovered that RecQ helicase and Topo III also can efficiently change the linking number of rcDNA, and we found that negative supercoils are exclusively introduced into covalently closed dsDNA. A mechanism for how RecQ helicase and Topo III promote such diverse reactions is proposed. Reagents—Chemicals were reagent grade, and all solutions were prepared using Barnstead NanoPure water. PEG (M r 8,000) was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in water as a 40% (w/v) stock, and used without further purification. Phosphoenolpyruvate and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Nucleotides were dissolved in water as concentrated stock solutions at pH 7.5 and the concentrations determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 1.54 × 104m-1 cm-1 at 260 nm. Chloroquine diphosphate was purchased from Sigma and was dissolved as a concentrated stock solution in water. Proteins—RecQ helicase and RecA protein were purified as described previously (39Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). E. coli Topo III and Topo I were purified as described previously (33DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32655-32659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wheat germ topoisomerase I was purchased from Promega. SSB protein was purified from E. coli strain RLM727 as described (41LeBowitz, J. (1985) Biochemical Mechanism of Strand Initiation in Bacteriophage Lambda DNA Replication. Ph.D. thesis, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MDGoogle Scholar), and its concentration was determined as described previously (42Harmon F.G. Rehrauer W.M. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23874-23883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae RPA was provided by Noriko Kantake (University of California, Davis, CA). DNA—pUC19 supercoiled DNA (scDNA) was purified using alkaline lysis followed by CsCl-ethidium bromide equilibrium centrifugation (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). pUC19 rcDNA was produced by treatment of pUC19 scDNA with 1 unit of wheat germ Topo I/μg of DNA, as described by the manufacturer. The relaxed dsDNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation, following phenol extraction. The molar nucleotide concentration of dsDNA was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.5 × 103m-1 cm-1 at 260 nm. Topoisomers having a defined mean ΔLk value (from 0.01 to -8.0) were produced from pUC19 scDNA using wheat germ Topo I and ethidium bromide, using the method of Bowater et al. (44Bowater R. Aboul-Ela F. Lilley D.M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 212: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RecQ Helicase-Topo III Assays—All catenation reactions were carried out as described previously (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), with the indicated changes. Standard conditions consisted of 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10% PEG, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 80 units ml-1 pyruvate kinase, 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP. Standard reactions were 50 μl and consisted of 15 μm (nucleotides: 5.6 nm molecules) pUC19 scDNA or rcDNA (as indicated), 1.0 μm SSB protein, 1.0 μm RecQ helicase, and 0.1 μm Topo III. When RPA was substituted for SSB protein, its concentration was 0.32 μm. Utilization of rcDNA substrate was determined from agarose gels stained with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide, using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The effect of SSB protein and RPA on the relaxation activity of Topo III was assayed under standard conditions without ATP and 10% PEG. Topo III was present at a concentration of 0.1 μm, which corresponded to a total of 8 units of topoisomerase activity. For each topoisomerase, 1 activity unit was the amount of protein needed to fully relax 200 ng of pUC19 scDNA in 10 min at 37 °C in 50 μl of the following buffer: 40 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 40% glycerol. Unless indicated differently, SSB protein and RPA were present at 0.43 and 0.32 μm, respectively. Aliquots of these reactions were stopped and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis as described below. Supercoiling reactions contained 15 μm (nucleotides; 5.6 nm molecules) pUC19 rcDNA, 1.0 μm SSB protein, 1.0 μm RecQ helicase, and 8 units of the indicated topoisomerase. Reactions with wheat germ Topo I were stopped by adding a mix of 5% SDS and 0.25 m EDTA to yield a final concentration of 1% SDS and 50 mm EDTA. The reactions with E. coli Topo I and Topo III were stopped by addition of 0.5 m EDTA to a final concentration of 50 mm, followed 2 min later by 10% SDS to a final concentration of 1%. Samples were deproteinized by treatment with 1.5 μg μl-1 proteinase K (Roche) at 37 °C for 10 min. pUC19 hdDNA was produced by first incubating a mock reaction lacking proteins at 95 °C for 5 min, then rapidly chilling the sample in an ice water bath for 5 min. Samples were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel, and run in 0.5× TBE buffer at 1.5 V cm-1 for 12 h. Where indicated, chloroquine diphosphate was present in the gel and running buffer at a concentration of either 0.8 or 8.0 μm. Gels were stained with 1.0 μg ml-1 ethidium bromide in water for 1 h, followed by extensive (>2 h) de-staining with water. Where indicated, gels were dried and probed as described previously (45Zerbib D. Colloms S.D. Sherratt D.J. West S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide probe was New England Biolabs M13/pUC19 reverse sequencing primer (-48) that had been 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Bands corresponding to DNA were detected using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Atomic Force Microscopy—Protein-free catenanes were isolated from a standard catenation reaction after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, followed by deproteinization with proteinase K treatment at 65 °C for 20 min. Proteinase K was inactivated by incubation at 75 °C for 20 min, and the DNA was precipitated with ethanol. The DNA was purified further by use of a MicroSpin S-400 column (Amersham Biosciences). To improve sensitivity, the protein-free catenanes were coated with RecA protein just prior to visualization. The RecA protein-DNA catenane complexes were formed in 50 μl as follows; 5 μm RecA protein was incubated with 66 units of wheat germ Topo I, and ∼30 μm (nucleotides) DNA products were incubated in 25 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm magnesium acetate and 2.5 mm ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. ATPγS was then added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and incubation was continued for another 30 min. A 20-μl aliquot of these complexes was then applied to a freshly cleaved mica surface, which was rinsed immediately with 1 ml of water and dried with a stream of nitrogen gas. The sample surface was imaged with a Digital Instruments Nanoscope III in air, using tapping mode with a TESP cantilever. Images were analyzed using Digital Instruments Nanoscope software. Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals That DNA Catenanes Are Formed by RecQ Helicase and Topo III—Previously, we showed that RecQ helicase and E. coli Topo III together comprise a potent DNA strand passage activity, which produces catenated dsDNA (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In a standard catenation reaction, Topo III and RecQ helicase (with E. coli SSB protein) convert pUC19 scDNA into complex, catenated DNA species (for a representative gel, see Fig. 2, lanes a-d). Using restriction analysis, we argued that these complex multimers represented fully catenated DNA (i.e. dsDNA molecules linked by a full dsDNA strand pass) rather than hemi-catenated DNA (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Both to confirm directly the structure of these multimers and to assess their complexity, protein-free catenanes were imaged by AFM. Visualization was aided by coating the DNA with RecA protein just prior to imaging (46Krasnow M.A. Stasiak A. Spengler S.J. Dean F. Koller T. Cozzarelli N.R. Nature. 1983; 304: 559-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A representative image, shown at low magnification (10-μm2 scan area), reveals that RecQ helicase and Topo III form a heterogeneous population of linked DNA molecules (Fig. 1A). The majority of the DNA molecules present are linked with others; of a total of ∼80 DNA molecules, ∼45 are catenated with one or more DNA molecules. In addition, approximately one-half of the catenanes share multiple points of crossover with the DNA molecules with which they are associated, and the remaining species represent singly linked DNA molecules. The most complex catenated DNA species have a similar makeup; they consist of one primary DNA molecule to which are linked many individual, secondary molecules (Fig. 1A, molecules a-d). Linked dsDNA molecules were not observed when a sample of the pUC19 scDNA substrate was imaged using the same procedure (data not shown). The DNA molecules in Fig. 1A that appear as arcs or incomplete circles are not broken DNA molecules but, instead, were not fully coated with RecA protein. At higher magnification, two different catenated DNA species (molecules 1 and 2 in Fig. 1A) show that the path of each individual DNA dsDNA molecule is consistent with a catenated structure (Fig. 1B). This direct analysis complements our previous findings demonstrating that Topo III and RecQ helicase produce fully catenated DNA. Macromolecular Crowding Favors the Formation of Catenanes by RecQ Helicase and Topo III—To better understand the means by which RecQ helicase and Topo III catenate DNA and to better mimic intracellular conditions, the role of the macromolecular crowding agent, PEG, was determined. The extent of catenation by RecQ helicase and Topo III could only be measured by quantifying the loss of the initial substrate, because the catenated DNA species are heterogeneous and, therefore, are difficult to quantify directly. However, quantification of the remaining pUC19 scDNA was complicated by the changes in topological state of the uncatenated scDNA substrate during the course of the reaction (Fig. 2, lanes a-d). To overcome this problem, rcDNA was used as the starting DNA substrate. Topo III and RecQ helicase readily catenate this DNA substrate in a reaction that is comparable with that observed with pUC19 scDNA (Fig. 2, compare lanes m-p with lanes a-d). Furthermore, neither RecQ helicase nor Topo III alone produces catenated DNA when provided with this DNA substrate (data not shown), and as seen previously with scDNA (37Harmon F.G. DiGate R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 611-620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We found that the concentration of PEG has a significant influence on the nature of the DNA species produced by the DNA strand passage activity of RecQ helicase and Topo III (Fig. 2). In the presence of 10% PEG (i.e. standard conditions), the reaction is biased toward the production of catenated DNA species, the electrophoretic mobility of which is slower and which accumulate over the 20-min time course (Fig. 2, lanes m-p). However, a small proportion of the rcDNA substrate is also converted to faster migrating topological forms. These presumably supercoiled DNA species reach their peak concentration at ∼5 min (lane n), and their levels do not increase over the remaining 15 min of the reaction. On the other hand, in the absence of PEG, the bias of the reaction shifted so that RecQ helicase and Topo III mainly change the topology of the individual rcDNA molecules, and produce fewer catenated DNA (Fig. 2, lanes e-h). Under these conditions, the majority of the rcDNA substrate is converted to the supercoiled DNA species, which initially are heterogeneous (i.e. at 5-10 min) and are subsequently converted into a distinct topological species (lane h). The composition of these topological forms is further investigated in a later section (see below). At an intermediate concentration of PEG, 5%, RecQ helicase and Topo III generate an approximately equal mixture of catenated and supercoiled products. The putatively supercoiled DNA products migrate more slowly than those produced at either 0 or 10% PEG, which is an indication that RecQ helicase and Topo III introduce smaller changes in the linking number of the rcDNA substrate. Finally, when the PEG concentration was elevated to 15%, catenation was drastically reduced (Fig. 2, lanes q-t) and only a small amount of supercoiled DNA was produced. At an even higher concentration of PEG (20%), the activities of RecQ helicase and Topo III were completely inhibited (data not shown). These results show that PEG is not absolutely required for RecQ helicase and Topo III to exhibit DNA strand passage activity; however, the macromolecular crowding effect of this volume excluding agent does stimulate DNA catenation.

https://openalex.org/W2008341422,"Transcription of Ebola virus (EBOV)-specific mRNA is driven by the nucleocapsid proteins NP, VP35, and L. This process is further dependent on VP30, an essential EBOV-specific transcription factor. The present study addresses the self-assembly of VP30 and the functional significance of this process for viral transcription and propagation. Essential for oligomerization of VP30 is a region spanning amino acids 94–112. Within this region a cluster of four leucine residues is of critical importance. Mutation of only one of these leucine residues resulted in oligomerization-deficient VP30 molecules that were no longer able to support EBOV-specific transcription. The essential role of homo-oligomerization for the function of VP30 was further corroborated by the finding that mixed VP30 oligomers consisting of VP30 and transcriptionally inactive VP30 mutants were impaired in their ability to support EBOV transcription. The dominant negative effect of these VP30 mutants was dependent on their ability to bind to VP30. The oligomerization of VP30 could be dose dependently inhibited by a 25-mer peptide (E30pep-wt) derived from the presumed oligomerization domain (IC50,1 μm). A control peptide (E30pep-3LA), in which three leucines were changed to alanine, had no inhibitory effect. Thus, E30pep-wt seemed to bind efficiently to VP30 and consequently blocked the oligomerization of the protein. When E30pep-wt was transfected into EBOV-infected cells, the peptide inhibited viral replication suggesting that inhibition of VP30 oligomerization represents a target for EBOV antiviral drugs.

Ebola virus (EBOV), 1The abbreviations used are: EBOV, Ebola virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; wt, wild type.1The abbreviations used are: EBOV, Ebola virus; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; wt, wild type. a filovirus, causes sporadic outbreaks of a fatal hemorrhagic fever in Africa (1World Health OrganizationWkly. Epidemiol. Rec. 2001; 76: 41-48PubMed Google Scholar, 2World Health OrganizationEpidemiol. Bull. 1995; 16: 16PubMed Google Scholar, 3Bowen E.T. Lloyd G. Harris W.J. Platt G.S. Baskerville A.

Since the natural host of the virus is not yet identified, the outbreaks are unpredictable and so are the risk factors for the population in the endemic areas in central Africa. To date, neither a vaccine nor a treatment of the EBOV infection are available. The enveloped EBOV particles are composed of seven structural proteins and the negative sense RNA genome. Four viral proteins NP, VP35, L, and VP30 are the constituents of the nucleocapsid. The main component of the nucleocapsid complex is NP, a heavily phosphorylated protein, that encapsidates the genomic RNA and forms intracellular inclusions upon recombinant expression (5Sanchez A. Kiley M.P. Holloway B.P. McCormick J.B. Auperin D.D. Virology. 1989; 170: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 6Elliott L.H. Kiley M.P. McCormick J.B. Virology. 1985; 147: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The NP inclusions are morphologically highly similar to the inclusions formed during EBOV infection of target cells. VP35 and L are the components of the viral polymerase. VP30 represents an EBOV-specific transcription activation factor (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most viruses of the order Mononegavirales contain three proteins, N (NP), P, and L, that drive the processes of replication (synthesis of genomic RNA) and transcription (synthesis of viral mRNAs). These proteins also constitute the respective viral nucleocapsid complex. N (or NP) represents the major nucleocapsid protein that encapsidates the viral genome. The encapsidated genome serves as a template for the viral polymerase complex, which is constituted by the catalytic subunit L and the cofactor P (8Conzelmann K.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 123-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An EBOV-specific minigenome-based reverse genetic system revealed that EBOV follows another strategy to synthesize the different RNA species. NP, VP35 (the P analogue), and L were sufficient for viral replication, similar to the other Mononegavirales. The fourth nucleocapsid protein, VP30, although not influencing replication, dramatically activated the synthesis of the viral mRNAs (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Volchkov V.E. Volchkova V.A. Mühlberger E. Kolesnikova L.V. Weik M. Dolnik O. Klenk H.D. Science. 2001; 291: 1965-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The exact mechanism of how VP30 activates transcription is still unclear. Recent investigations have suggested that VP30 most probably is effective at a very early stage of transcription. Transcription of the EBOV minigenomes could take place in the absence of VP30 if an RNA secondary structure that includes the transcription start site of the first gene (NP) is destroyed (10Weik M. Modrof J. Klenk H.D. Becker S. Mühlberger E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8532-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Thus, one function of VP30 during transcription might be to overcome this barrier. Transcription activation by VP30 is strongly regulated by the phosphorylation state of VP30. While the non- or weakly phosphorylated protein activates transcription, the fully phosphorylated VP30 is strongly inhibited in this function. In contrast, the binding of VP30 to nucleocapsid-like structures that are formed by the major nucleocapsid protein NP is inversely regulated. The phosphorylated VP30 binds to the nucleocapsid-like structures, whereas the nonphosphorylated protein does not (11Modrof J. Mühlberger E. Klenk H.D. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33099-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). VP30 contains a nonconventional zinc finger whose integrity is a prerequisite for the function of the protein (12Modrof J. Becker S. Mühlberger E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 3334-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated whether VP30, like many other transcription factors, is a homo-oligomer and, if so, whether the oligomerization is essential for its function. It was found that VP30 is, indeed, present as an oligomer. Relevant for oligomerization is a stretch of ∼20 amino acids flanking a central tetraleucine cluster whose integrity is essential for VP30 self-association. While oligomerization is not needed for the interaction of VP30 with the EBOV nucleocapsid, oligomerization of VP30 is essential for the transactivating function and for the propagation of EBOV in cell culture. Viruses and Cell Lines—EBOV-Zaire strain Mayinga was grown and passaged under biosafety level 4 conditions as described elsewhere (13Becker S. Feldmann H. Will C. Slenczka W. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 181: 43-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The recombinant vaccinia virus MVA-T7 was grown and titered in chicken embryo fibroblasts (14Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Monolayer cultures of HeLa cells were used for all experiments with the recombinant vaccinia virus MVA-T7, and cells were cultured as described by Mühlberger et al. (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BSR T7/5 cells (a BHK-21 cell clone), which constitutively expressed T7 RNA polymerase, were cultured as described by Buchholz et al. (15Buchholz U.J. Finke S. Conzelmann K.K. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For transfection experiments, cells were grown in 6-well plates (7 cm2). HUH7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Molecular Cloning of VP30 and VP30 Mutants—For expression of VP30 and the VP30 mutants, the respective genes were cloned into the plasmid pTM1 under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter (16Fuerst T.R. Niles E.G. Studier F.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8122-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (1861) Google Scholar). The cloning of pT-VP30f, pT-VP30, and pT-VP30ΔN2–68 has been described previously (11Modrof J. Mühlberger E. Klenk H.D. Becker S. J. Biol.

Cloning of the Mutants pT-VP30fΔC114–288 and pT-VP30ΔC114–288— The coding region for amino acids 1–113 of the VP30 gene was amplified by PCR using pT-VP30 as template. For synthesis of pT-VP30fΔC the primers 410 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG GAA GCT TCA TAT GAG AGA GGA CG-3′) and 711 (5′-AGA CTC GAG TTA TTC TAC TGA TCC ACA AGT CTT ACG G-3′) were used. 410, the forward primer, contained a BamHI restriction site (underlined) and the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (abbreviated f). The reverse primer 711 contained an XhoI restriction site (underlined). To construct pT-VP30ΔC, the forward primer 408 (5′-ACC GGA TCC ATG GAA GCT TCA TAT GAG AGA-3′) was used in combination with 711. The resulting DNA fragments were cloned into the plasmid pTM1. Cloning of the Mutants pT-VP30Δ 72–112 and pT-VP30fΔ 72–93—For the internal deletions of the mutants pT-VP30fΔ72–112 and pT-VP30Δ72–93 a second PshAI restriction site was inserted into the vector pT-VP30f at position 8721 (EBOV genome) in the case of pT-VP30fΔ72–112 or at position 8786 for the construct pT-VP30Δ72–93 using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The resulting vector was digested with PshAI, the DNA fragments encoding either amino acids 72–112 or 72–93 were removed, and the remaining fragments were religated. Cloning of VP30 Substitution Mutants—Cloning of the VP30 substitution mutants was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with either pT-VP30f, pT-VP30, pT-VP30fΔN, or pT-VP30fΔC as template. All mutants were verified by sequencing. Ebola Virus Transcription Analysis—BSR T7/5 cells (5 × 105 in a 7-cm2 well) were transfected with plasmids encoding the EBOV nucleocapsid proteins NP, VP35, VP30 (or/and VP30 mutants), L, and an EBOV-specific minigenome containing the CAT reporter gene (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the supplier's protocol. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 8–12 h and then washed two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and further incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12–36 h at 37 °C. Subsequently cells were harvested, and CAT activity, as a readout for transcription activity, was determined. CAT Assay—CAT activity was determined using a standard protocol (17Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar). Quantification of the radioactivity was done with a Fuji BAS-1000 Bio-Imager analyzer (Fujifilm) by using the TINA software (Raytest). Peptide Synthesis—The peptides were synthesized by Dr. M. Krause at the Institute of Molecular Biology and Tumor Research (Philipps University of Marburg). The peptides E30pep-wt (QLESLTDRELLLLIARKTCGSVE-CONH2) and E30pep-3LA (QLESLTDREAAALIARKTCGSVE-CONH2) were derived from the Ebola virus VP30 amino acid sequence 91–113; in E30pep-3LA the leucines at position 100–102 were replaced by alanines. In Vitro Translation with Peptide Inhibition—pT-VP30 and pT-VP30f were in vitro translated simultaneously and metabolically labeled with 35S Promix using the TnT T7 quick coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the supplier's protocol. Before starting the in vitro translation, peptides were added in different concentrations (which are given in Fig. 6). Afterward 5 μl of each in vitro translation reaction was diluted into 500 μl of CoIP buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0,4% deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Coimmunoprecipitation with the monoclonal α-FLAG antibody M2 (Sigma) was performed as described elsewhere (18Modrof J. Moritz C. Kolesnikova L. Konakova T. Hartlieb B. Randolf A. Mühlberger E.

VP30 Forms Oligomers—To investigate oligomerization of VP30, we took advantage of the fact that the fusion of a FLAG epitope to the C terminus of VP30 (VP30f) resulted in a SDS-PAGE migration velocity of the fusion protein that is distinguishable from VP30 (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Upon single expression of VP30f and VP30 and subsequent immunoprecipitation, the α-FLAG monoclonal antibody that was used recognized the epitope-tagged protein but not wild-type VP30 (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). However, upon coexpression, the α-FLAG antibody sedimented both proteins indicating that VP30 interacted with VP30f and the mixed oligomers were precipitated (Fig. 1, lane 3). An interaction between VP30f and VP30 was only detected when both proteins were coexpressed. Mixing of preformed VP30 and VP30f did not lead to significant amounts of VP30·VP30f complexes (data not shown). These results suggest that (i) VP30 oligomerizes cotranslationally or rapidly after synthesis and (ii) the formed oligomers are stable and do not dissociate easily (19Curran J. Boeck R. Lin-Marq N. Lupas A. Kolakofsky D. Virology. 1995; 214: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Localization of the Oligomerization Site—To map the oligomerization site of VP30, N- and C-terminal deletion mutants as well as internal deletion mutants of VP30 were constructed (Fig. 2A) and used in a coimmunoprecipitation assay. VP30 and VP30 mutants were expressed in HeLa cells, and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG antibody. Mutants lacking the N-terminal 68 (VP30ΔN) and the C-terminal 174 amino acids (VP30ΔC) were still able to interact with VP30 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). While an internal deletion of amino acids 72–93 left VP30 in an oligomerization-competent state (lane 3, VP30Δ 72–93), deletion of amino acids 72–112 abolished oligomerization completely (lane 4, VP30Δ 72–112). Thus, amino acids 94–112 are essential for oligomerization of VP30. Oligomerization via a Tetraleucine Motif—In silico analyses of the amino acid sequence of the determined region (20Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) predicted an α-helical structure between amino acid residues 97–106. Within this region, a cluster of four leucines was most remarkable (Fig. 3A). To investigate the significance of this cluster for the oligomerization of VP30, single leucine residues were substituted by alanines. Each mutant was also constructed as a FLAG-tagged twin. Pairs of tagged and untagged VP30 mutants were coexpressed in HeLa cells, radioactively labeled, and immunoprecipitated with an α-FLAG antibody (Fig. 3B). Substitutions in the tetraleucine motif impaired oligomerization of VP30 drastically even if only one of the leucine residues was changed to alanine (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–7). Immunoprecipitation of the cell lysates with an α-VP30 serum confirmed the presence of the non-interacting VP30 mutants (data not shown). Oligomerization Does Not Influence the Interaction between VP30 and the NP-induced Inclusions—It was then analyzed whether the oligomerization of VP30 is essential for the ability of the protein to interact with the nucleocapsid of EBOV. To this end, we took advantage of the fact that upon coexpression with the major nucleocapsid protein NP the homogenously distributed VP30 relocalizes into NP-induced inclusions (Fig. 4A and Ref. 11Modrof J. Mühlberger E. Klenk H.D. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33099-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). When the oligomerization-deficient mutant VP30L100–102A was coexpressed with NP, both proteins were still detected in the NP-induced inclusions suggesting that the oligomerization of VP30 is not essential for its binding to NP inclusions (Fig. 4B). Oligomerization Is Essential for Transcription Activation by VP30 —It was then of interest whether the oligomerization of VP30 influenced EBOV-specific transcription. This was investigated by using an EBOV-specific transcription system that is active only in the presence of VP30 (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VP30 activates the transcription of an EBOV-specific minigenome that contains a CAT reporter gene. The resulting CAT activity is a readout for the EBOV-specific transcription (Fig. 3C, lanes 1 and 2, and Ref. 7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this system, the wild-type VP30 was replaced by the VP30 Leu → Ala substitution mutants (Fig. 3A), and the effect of the replacement was determined by quantifying the CAT reporter gene activity. None of the substitution mutants was able to activate EBOV transcription (lanes 3–6), strongly suggesting that oligomerization of VP30 is required for EBOV transcription. To confirm this result we investigated the following working hypothesis. If oligomerization of functional VP30 molecules is essential for transcription activation, mixed oligomers of wild-type VP30 and inactive VP30 mutants that still contain an intact oligomerization domain (VP30ΔN or VP30ΔC, Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3) should be impaired in their ability to activate transcription. In contrast, a combination of VP30 and inactive VP30 mutants, which should not bind to VP30 since the presumed oligomerization site contained leucine to alanine mutations (e.g. VP30ΔNL100A and VP30ΔCL100A), should leave the transcription activation function of wild-type VP30 unimpaired. First, activity of VP30 deletion mutants was tested with the result that VP30ΔN and VP30ΔC turned out to be inactive (Fig. 5A, panel I, lane 3, and B, panel I, lane 2). Then a transcription assay was set up coexpressing VP30 and either VP30ΔN or VP30ΔC. CAT reporter gene activity was determined at 36 h posttransfection. The transcription activity that was detected using wild-type VP30 alone was set to 100% (Fig. 5, A and B, panels II). The addition of VP30ΔN or VP30ΔC led to a significant reduction of transcription (Fig. 5, A, lane 4, and B, lane 3). In contrast, the addition of VP30ΔNL100–102A or VP30ΔCL100–102A that are both inactive but cannot bind to VP30 did not modify significantly the activity of the transcription system (Fig. 5, A, lane 6, and B, lane 5). The protein expression of VP30 and the VP30 mutants had been controlled by Western blotting (Fig. 5, A and B, panels III). So far the results have been in accord with the above described hypothesis. Surprisingly the mutants that had changed only one leucine to alanine (VP30ΔNL100A and VP30ΔCL100A) turned out to be dominant negative like VP30ΔN and VP30ΔC (Fig. 5, A, lane 5, and B, lane 4). Therefore we presumed that the mutants containing only a single leucine → alanine substitution were still able to bind to VP30 and thus induce the negative effect. To test this presumption, several FLAG-tagged VP30ΔN mutants were coexpressed with VP30wt or VP30L100A and precipitated with an α-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5C, lanes 1–4). The experiment revealed that, indeed, VP30ΔNL100A was able to oligomerize with VP30, although binding was reduced (lane 2). The mutant VP30ΔNL100–102A showed no interaction with VP30 (lane 3). Interestingly no cosedimentation was observed if both the full-length VP30 protein and the ΔN mutant contained a mutation of one leucine residue to alanine (lane 4). The latter result confirmed the results of Fig. 3B. Taken together, the oligomerization of wild-type VP30 with an inactive VP30 mutant inhibited the transactivating function of VP30. Thus, it can be concluded that (i) the oligomerization of intact VP30 monomers is the prerequisite for the function of VP30 as a transcriptional activator and (ii) inactive mutants of VP30 that are able to oligomerize display a dominant negative phenotype. Inhibition of VP30 Oligomerization Using Synthetic Peptides—To further investigate the oligomerization of VP30, we used peptides that were derived from the presumed oligomerization domain to check whether these could inhibit the self-assembly of VP30. One of the peptides used was identical to amino acids 91–113 (Fig. 6A, E30pep-wt); the other contained three leucine to alanine substitutions (E30pep-3LA). VP30 and FLAG-tagged VP30 were in vitro translated in the presence of increasing concentrations of the peptides E30pep-wt or E30pep-3LA (0–10 μm). Then the FLAG-tagged VP30 was precipitated with an α-FLAG antibody, the immunoprecipitate was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the amount of precipitated VP30f and cosedimented VP30 was quantified (Fig. 6, B and C). The presence of E30pep-wt during the coexpression of VP30 and VP30f resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of the oligomerization of VP30 (Fig. 6, B and C, left panel). The IC50 for the inhibition was approximately 1 μm. The presence of identical concentrations of the control peptide E30pep-3LA had no effect on oligomerization (Fig. 6, B and C, right panel). The peptides did not affect the expression of VP30 or VP30f (Fig. 6D). To summarize these findings, peptides consisting of the amino acids 91–113 of VP30 were sufficient to compete with VP30 for its binding to VP30f. Essential for the ability of the peptide to bind VP30 was the presence of a leucine cluster at positions 100–102. Thus, these 20 amino acids seemed to be sufficient to bind and block the oligomerization site of VP30. Altogether our findings support the view that VP30 oligomerization is essential for the activity of the protein in viral transcription and that the oligomerization is mediated by amino acids 91–113 comprising a tetraleucine cluster whose presence is critical. Influence of VP30 Oligomerization on EBOV Propagation— Finally we checked whether VP30 oligomerization was also essential for the propagation of EBOV in cell culture. Thus, Vero cells were transfected with the peptide E30pep-wt or E30pep-3LA and subsequently infected with EBOV. At 24 h postinfection, the number of infected cells was determined by the presence of the typical NP inclusions. We found that the presence of E30pep-wt, but not E30pep-3LA, inhibited the EBOV infection indicating that oligomerization of VP30 plays an essential role for the replication cycle of EBOV (Fig. 7). Experiments with EBOV-infected HUH7 cells essentially gave the same results (data not shown). Because of the limited coding capacity of the EBOV genome the virus exploits the available genomic information extensively, leading to the phenomenon that EBOV proteins often have several functions. This has been shown e.g. for the matrix protein VP40 that on the one hand triggers budding of progeny viruses and on the other hand is an important factor for viral morphology (21Licata J.M. Simpson-Holley M. Wright N.T. Han Z. Paragas J. Harty R.N. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 1812-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 22Timmins J. Schoehn G. Ricard-Blum S. Scianimanico S. Vernet T.

Virol. 2002; 76: 4855-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Another example is VP35, the cofactor of the viral polymerase L. VP35 is essential for viral RNA synthesis and simultaneously shuts down the interferon response of the host cell (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Basler C.F. Wang X. Mühlberger E. Volchkov V. Paragas J. Klenk H.D. Garcia-Sastre A. Palese P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12289-12294Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). It is poorly understood whether and how the different functions of the two proteins are regulated. Additional information is available on the regulation of the two functions of VP30. It has been shown that the protein is not only an activator of viral transcription but is also involved in the formation of the viral nucleocapsid. The switch between the two functions of VP30 is presumed to be modulated by phosphorylation of six serine residues in the N terminus of the molecule (11Modrof J. Mühlberger E. Klenk H.D. Becker S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33099-33104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In the present study, we focused on the function of another co- or posttranslational modification of VP30, the homo-oligomerization of the protein. We investigated whether the homo-oligomerization of VP30 is important for binding to the nucleocapsid, the transcription activation, or both. To this end, we first mapped the homo-oligomerization domain of EBOV VP30 and found that amino acids 94–112 are essential for binding. Of critical importance was a cluster of four leucine residues inside the detected region. Even the replacement of one of the leucines was sufficient to inhibit significantly the self-assembly of VP30 molecules. In silico analyses based on the algorithm of Rost and Sander (20Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) predicted an α-helical structure that encompasses amino acid residues 97–106. It is presumed that oligomerization of VP30 is dependent on the formation of the predicted α-helix. The stoichiometry of the complex has yet to be determined. Examples of viral proteins whose oligomerization is also dependent on hydrophobic residues inside an α-helical structure are the 2B protein of coxsackievirus or the E4 protein of human papillomavirus (25de Jong A.S. Schrama I.W. Willems P.H. Galama J.M. Melchers W.J. van Kuppeveld F.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 783-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 26Ashmole I. Gallimore P.H. Roberts S. Virology. 1998; 240: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, within these proteins the hydrophobic residues essential for oligomerization are facing the same direction. The three leucines that are relevant for VP30 oligomerization are adjacent to each other and therefore face different directions within the α-helical structure. It is likely that the leucines are essential to support the formation of the α-helix that in turn is necessary for VP30 homo-oligomerization. The fact that the leucine cluster is highly conserved in VP30 of the closely related Marburg virus further pointed to an important biological role of this particular region. Further experiments showed that Marburg virus VP30 is also present as an oligomer (data not shown). When the oligomerization-incompetent VP30 mutants were checked for their capability to interact with NP inclusions that represent accumulations of nucleocapsid-like structures, it was found that oligomerization was not necessary for binding to the NP inclusions. This result suggested that the nucleocapsid-binding domain of VP30 is not influenced by the oligomerization of the protein. A similar result has been observed for the protein of human parainfluenza virus type 3. Formation of the complex between P protein and the nucleocapsid protein N and interaction with the N RNA template were independent of P protein oligomerization (27Choudhary S.K. Malur A.G. Huo Y. De B.P. Banerjee A.K. Virology. 2002; 302: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In a reconstituted plasmid-based minigenome system, VP30 has been shown to activate viral transcription efficiently (7Mühlberger E. Weik M. Volchkov V.E. Klenk H.-D. Becker S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2333-2342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When oligomerization-incompetent VP30 mutants were used in the EBOV-specific replication/transcription system, it turned out that the transcription activation function of the protein was completely inhibited. This result suggested that the transactive form of VP30 is a complex of several VP30 molecules. This was underlined by the finding that inactive but oligomerization-competent VP30 mutants displayed a dominant negative effect on VP30-mediated transcription. In contrast, inactive and oligomerization-deficient VP30 mutants did not impair the activity of wild-type VP30. It is known that several viral and cellular transcription factors are functional as homo-oligomers. Thus, the human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 Tax protein e.g. represents a transcriptional activator of viral and cellular genes and functions optimally as a homodimer (28Jin D.Y. Jeang K.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The active conformation of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is tetrameric, and the oligomerization is permitted by a tetramerization domain whose integrity is essential for DNA binding (29Chene P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2611-2617Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Moreover many other DNA- or RNA-binding proteins like the Rev protein and the integrase of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or the baculovirus IE1 are active as oligomers (30Thomas S.L. Oft M. Jaksche H. Casari G. Heger P. Dobrovnik M. Bevec D. Hauber J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2935-2944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lutzke R.A. Plasterk R.H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4841-4848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Olson V.A. Wetter J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6042-6051Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although it is not yet clear whether VP30 binds RNA directly, VP30 is essential for a very early step of transcription that is modulated by an RNA secondary structure that was found to be present in the EBOV genome and in the transcript of the first gene (NP). Possibly VP30 functions as a helicase that helps the polymerase complex to overcome the secondary structure. This can be concluded from the finding that, after deletion of the secondary structure, EBOV transcription becomes independent of VP30 (10Weik M. Modrof J. Klenk H.D. Becker S. Mühlberger E. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8532-8539Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Analysis of the VP30 amino acid sequence revealed a QXXR motif at amino acids 228–231 that is specific for the DEA(D/H) box of RNA helicases (33Caruthers J.M. McKay D.B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The arginine in this motif has been postulated to interact with RNA (34Caruthers J.M. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13080-13085Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Whether VP30 indeed acts as a helicase remains to be shown. VP30 oligomerization could be inhibited by a synthetic peptide (E30pep-wt), consisting of 25 amino acids that were homologous to the presumed oligomerization domain of VP30 (containing the leucine cluster). In contrast, oligomerization was not inhibited by a peptide (E30pep-3LA) in which three of the four leucines were replaced by alanines. Inhibition of protein oligomerization with synthetic peptides is a new but widely used method. For example, Maroun et al. (35Maroun R.G. Gayet S. Benleulmi M.S. Porumb H. Zargarian L. Merad H. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13840-13848Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) used peptides to inhibit the dimerization of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 integrase, and Shangary and Johnson (36Shangary S. Johnson D.E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9485-9495Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) showed inhibition of the heterodimerization of BAX/Bcl-2 and BAX/Bcl-xL by synthetic peptides. In both cases, the sequence of the peptides used was derived from proposed interaction domains of the respective protein targets. While the IC50 for inhibition of the heterodimerization of BAX/Bcl-2 was 15 μm, the IC50 tested by integration of human immunodeficiency virus into the genome was 80 nm. The detected IC50 of approximately 1 μm for the inhibition of VP30 oligomerization by E30pep-wt reflects that the peptide efficiently disturbed the VP30 self-interaction. To address the role of VP30 oligomerization in the context of the viral life cycle, EBOV-infected cells were transfected with E30pep-wt. The resulting inhibition of EBOV growth was specific since the control peptide E30pep-3LA did not show a substantial inhibitory effect. These data provide evidence that oligomerization of VP30 is essential for EBOV propagation. Similar results concerning the function of homo-oligomerization have been reported for the ICP0 protein of Herpes simplex virus type I, which is a viral transactivator (37Lium E.K. Panagiotidis C.A. Wen X. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7785-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon coexpression of active and inactive forms of ICP0, a mixed oligomer is formed resulting in an inactive ICP0. The concentration of E30pep-wt that was necessary to inhibit the EBOV infection was considerably higher than the concentration used in the in vitro system. On one hand, this is due to the necessity to transfect the peptide into the cell. On the other hand, E30pep-wt had to compete with the already oligomerized VP30 that is introduced into the cell by the input virus. In summary, the data showed that VP30 oligomerization is dependent on a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids with four central leucine residues. Mutation of the leucine residues inactivated the VP30-dependent EBOV transcription. Moreover EBOV propagation was impaired upon inhibition of VP30 oligomerization by synthetic peptides that were identical to the presumed oligomerization domain."

The enzymes responsible for producing cyclic ADP-ribose in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells remain unknown; however, two mammalian enzymes that are capable of producing cyclic ADP-ribose extracellularly have been identified, CD38 and CD157. The present study investigated whether an ADP-ribosyl cyclase/NAD+-glycohydrolase independent of CD38 is present in brain tissue. To address this question, NAD+ metabolizing activities were accurately examined in developing and adult Cd38 -/- mouse brain protein extracts and cells. Low ADP-ribosyl cyclase and NAD+-glycohydrolase activities (in the range of pmol of product formed/mg of protein/min) were detected in Cd38 -/- brain at all developmental stages studied. Both activities were found to be associated with cell membranes. The activities were significantly higher in Triton X-100-treated neural cells compared with intact cells, suggesting an intracellular location of the novel cyclase. The cyclase and glycohydrolase activities were optimal at pH 6.0 and were inhibited by zinc, properties which are distinct from those of CD157. Both activities were enhanced by guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), a result suggesting that the novel enzyme may be regulated by a G protein-dependent mechanism. Altogether our results indicate the presence of an intracellular membrane-bound ADP-ribosyl cyclase/NAD+-glycohydrolase distinct from CD38 and from CD157 in mouse brain. This novel enzyme, which is more active in the developing brain than in the adult tissue, may play an important role in cyclic ADP-ribose-mediated calcium signaling during brain development as well as in adult tissue.

This novel enzyme, which is more active in the developing brain than in the adult tissue, may play an important role in cyclic ADP-ribose-mediated calcium signaling during brain development as well as in adult tissue. Calcium is a universal signaling molecule that is involved in a wide variety of processes in almost all cell types from procaryotes to eucaryotes. The increase in cytosolic calcium levels necessary for signal transduction is usually achieved by entry of extracellular calcium and amplification of the process by calcium released from intracellular storage sites. The intracellular calcium mobilization occurs via two major families of channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, i.e. the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and the ryanodine receptors. The amplification of cytosolic calcium has been shown to be regulated by cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR), 1The abbreviations used are: cADPR, cyclic ADP-ribose; ADPR, ADP-ribose; NGD+, nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide; ADPRyl cyclase, ADP-ribosyl cyclase; NADase, NAD+-glycohydrolase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); GDPβS, guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate); Sol extract, soluble extract obtained after high speed centrifugation; P10 extract, membrane extract obtained after low speed centrifugation; P540 extract, membrane extract obtained after high speed centrifugation; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; E, embryonic day; PN, postnatal day; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid. a metabolite of NAD+, that modulates calcium-induced calcium release. This regulation of calcium mobilization via cADPR has been conserved during evolution (1Wu Y. Kuzma J. Marechal E. Graeff R. Lee H.C. Foster R. Chua N.H.

The ryanodine receptors, at least some isoforms, are generally considered to be responsive to cADPR (3Sitsapesan R. McGarry S.J. Williams A.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 386-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, effects of cADPR on the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced calcium release and the binding of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to its receptors were also described recently (4Missiaen L.

The cascade of cellular events leading to the control of intracellular calcium channels by cADPR remains to be clarified. One of the most intriguing questions concerns the identity of the enzyme(s) that is responsible for producing cADPR in the cytosol of mammalian cells. Cyclic ADPR is known to be synthesized from NAD+ by enzymes having ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. The first cyclase discovered was isolated from the ovotestis of Aplysia californica (6Glick D.L. Hellmich M.R. Beushausen S. Tempst P. Bayley H. Strumwasser F. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). More recently, the Aplysia cyclase was also found in the neurons of this mollusk (7Mothet J.P. Fossier P. Meunier F.M. Stinnakre J. Tauc L. Baux G. J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In mammals, two proteins having around 30% sequence identity with the Aplysia cyclase and capable of ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity have been identified: CD38, which is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in many tissues, (8States D.J.

We recently have shown that the cADPR contents are nearly equivalent in brain tissues isolated from wild type and Cd38 -/- mice (15Partida-Sanchez S. Cockayne D.A. Monard S. Jacobson E.L.

To explain such observations we proposed that an ADP-ribosyl cyclase distinct from CD38 and with low basal activity might be present in brain and responsible for the cADPR synthesis in that tissue. In the present study, we have examined NAD+ metabolizing activities in brain extracts and cells isolated from Cd38 -/- animals using a highly sensitive technique based on [14C]NAD+ utilization and HPLC analysis. We demonstrate the presence of a novel ADP-ribosyl cyclase/NAD+-glycohydrolase in developing and adult brain. The enzyme, which has clearly different biochemical properties from CD157, is more active in developing brain tissue compared with adult tissue. Experiments on Cd38 -/- brain protein extracts and cells strongly suggest that the enzyme is intracellularly located. Lastly the activity of the novel cyclase is enhanced by GTPγS in vitro and could therefore be regulated by a G protein-dependent signaling pathway. Materials—ADP-ribosyl cyclase from A. californica, nucleotide pyrophosphatase from Crotalus atrox venom, NAD+-glycohydrolase from Neurospora crassa, NAD+, and phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C were purchased from Sigma. GTPγS and GDPβS were purchased from Roche Applied Science and Sigma. [14C]NAD+ (nicotinamide [U-14C]adenine dinucleotide, 300 mCi/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Brain Protein Extracts—Protein extracts were prepared from developing (embryonic day 15, called E15, and postnatal day 1, called PN1) and adult brains of B6.192P2-(N12) Cd38 -/- (28Cockayne D.A. Muchamuel T. Grimaldi J.C. Muller-Steffner H. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Murray R. Schuber F. Howard M.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mice. Adult brains were perfused with phosphate-buffered saline medium containing 5 mm EDTA. After dissection, tissues were either flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or used immediately. Frozen tissues were first ground using a mortar and pestle and then suspended, using a Potter-Elvehjem grinder, in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 10% (w/w) glycerol, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 units/ml DNase I (Roche Applied Science), and protease inhibitors (Complete™, Roche Applied Science). Fresh tissues were directly suspended in the lysis buffer. The extract obtained at this step is referred to as the crude (or total) protein extract. After centrifugation of the total extract for 30 min at 1,000 × g to eliminate non-lysed cells, the supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The pellet (referred to as P10) was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 10% (w/w) glycerol, and protease inhibitors, and the supernatant was centrifuged again for 30 min at 540,000 × g. The pellet obtained by high speed centrifugation (referred to as P540 extract) was resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0, 10% (w/w) glycerol, and protease inhibitors, and the soluble (referred to as Sol) extract was collected. Protein content was determined according to Bradford (29Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Suspended Cells from Neonate Cerebral Hemispheres—Cerebral hemispheres from neonatal mice (between day 1 or 2 postpartum) were dissected and cleaned of meninges in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen). Each cerebral hemisphere was then gently triturated using a plastic pipette until a homogenous suspension was obtained. After centrifugation the cell pellet was resuspended in a saline medium containing 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 30 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes at pH 7.5. Viable cells were counted using a mix of acridine orange and ethidium bromide: about 90% of the cells were viable under our experimental conditions. The same pool of suspended cells was divided to compare the activity of intact and permeabilized cells. Permeabilization was performed by adding 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Enzymatic Reactions with [14C]NAD + —Protein extracts were incubated with 60 μm [14C]NAD+ (8 mCi/mmol) at 32 °C in 20 mm citrate-HCl (pH 4.0), MES-NaOH (pH 5.0 and 6.0), or Tris-HCl (pH 7.0 and 8.0). In the assay with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, the P540 extract (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 30 min at 32 °C and pH 7.0 in the presence of 1 unit of enzyme. To test the effect of high salt concentrations, the P540 extract (1 mg/ml) was incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with stirring in a buffer containing 500 mm KCl, 150 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8.0. Samples were subsequently centrifuged for 30 min at 540,000 × g. The NAD+ metabolizing activities were then measured (15-h incubation of extract at 1 mg/ml with 60 μm NAD+, 2 mm EDTA at 32 °C and pH 6.0) in the pellet and supernatant and compared with the activity observed in the non-treated P540 extract. In the assays with nucleotides, the P540 extracts (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 1 h at pH 7.0 with 300 μm cGMP, GTPγS, GDPβS, or ATPγS or with 1 mm GTP or ATP before NAD+ was added. Then measurements of the NAD+ metabolizing activity were performed (3-h incubation at pH 7.0). In the experiment performed with cGMP, 300 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were added to inhibit cGMP degradation. Suspended cerebral hemisphere cells (4 × 106 cells in 200 μl of reaction medium, corresponding to an average of 3.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with 200 μm [14C]NAD+ (4 mCi/mmol) for 4 h at 37 °C and pH 7.5 in a saline medium (see above) either in the absence or presence of 1% (w/v) Triton X-100. Standards were prepared by mixing products (1:1:1) formed by reacting [14C]NAD+ with Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (60 μm NAD+, 0.4 μg/ml enzyme; 15-min incubation at 32 °C), with nucleotide pyrophosphatase (60 μm NAD+, 0.04 units/ml enzyme; 15-min incubation at 32 °C), and with NAD+-glycohydrolase (NADase) (60 μm NAD+, 0.04 units/ml enzyme; 15-min incubation at 32 °C). All reactions were stopped at given times by adding 10% (v/v) perchloric acid, incubating for 10 min at 6 °C, and then centrifuging the samples (16,000 × g for 10 min). After neutralization of the supernatant with K2CO3 and a short centrifugation of the sample to eliminate the precipitates, the supernatant containing the reaction products was analyzed by HPLC. Enzymatic Reactions with NGD + —Assays of GDP-ribosyl cyclase activity were performed with P540 protein extracts (1 mg/ml) using 1 mm NGD+ in 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MES-NaOH at pH 6.0 and 32 °C. Extracts from adult Cd38 -/- brains were tested within 22 h of incubation time. Extracts from E15 Cd38 -/- brains were tested within 16 h of incubation time. Controls performed under exactly the same conditions, but with boiled P540 extract, were performed. To avoid any destruction of the fluorescent reaction product cyclic GDP-ribose by perchloric acid, 2C. Ceni and M.-J. Moutin, unpublished observation. the proteins in the assay were eliminated by centrifugation at 540,000 × g and 0 °C for 30 min followed by filtration of the supernatant through a Microsep 10K filter (Gelman Laboratory, Northborough, MA). The reaction products were then analyzed by HPLC. Standards were prepared by reacting NGD+ with Aplysia ADP-ribosyl cyclase (20 μm NGD+, 0.4 μg/ml enzyme, 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.0 and 32 °C for a 5-min incubation). Enzymatic Reactions with [14C]cADPR—[14C]cADPR was synthesized from [14C]NAD+ using Aplysia cyclase. Then P540 extracts (2 mg/ml) were tested for cADPR hydrolase activity by a 23-h incubation with 60 μm [14C]cADPR (6 mCi/mmol) in 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm MESNaOH at pH 6.0 and 32 °C. Control experiments were performed under the same conditions but in the absence of the P540 extract. Analysis by HPLC—HPLC analysis was performed on a 300-× 3.0-mm μBondapak C18 column (Waters) equipped with a guard column (LiChroCART® 4-4 LiChrospher® 100 RP-18 5 μm, Merck Eurolab) as in Ref. 30Augustin A. Muller-Steffner H. Schuber F. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 43-52PubMed Google Scholar. Aliquots of 50-100 μl were injected and eluted isocratically at room temperature with a medium containing 10 mm ammonium phosphate buffer at pH 5.5 and 1% (v/v) acetonitrile. Radiodetection of the products was performed with an on-line radioactivity monitor (LB 506D, Berthold) after mixing eluting products with a scintillation liquid (Quickzint flow 302, Zinsser Analytic) using a pump (LP 5035, Berthold). Reaction products of NAD+ (ADPR, cADPR, and AMP) were identified on the chromatograms by separately injecting standards. Cyclic ADP-ribose was further identified by its chemical conversion to ADPR when incubated for 15 min at 100 °C. ADPR was also characterized by its enzymatic transformation to AMP catalyzed by nucleotide pyrophosphatase. The NAD+ products were always separated in the same order; however, elution times could vary (particularly for NAD+). This was due to differences in the room temperature in which the experiment was performed or the age of the C18 column. We controlled for these variables by running the standards every time the experiments were performed. Chromatograms of the standards are shown in two critical figures (Figs. 1 and 6).Fig. 6Comparison of NAD+ metabolizing activities from intact (A) and permeabilized (B) cerebral hemisphere cells isolated from Cd38 -/- neonates. Suspensions of cells obtained from the cerebral hemispheres of Cd38 -/- neonates were separated into two pools. One pool was maintained in a saline medium, and the other was permeabilized by adding 1% Triton X-100. Intact and permeabilized cells (4 × 106 cells/assay) were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and pH 7.5 with 200 μm [14C]NAD+ (4 mCi/mmol) in the presence of 5 mm EDTA.

Previous results have shown that the cADPR content of brain homogenates prepared from Cd38 -/- mice is only marginally reduced when compared with wild type brain homogenates, suggesting the existence of an ADP-ribosyl cyclase distinct from CD38 in the brain (15Partida-Sanchez S. Cockayne D.A. Monard S. Jacobson E.L. Oppenheimer N. Garvy B. Kusser K. Goodrich S. Howard M. Harmsen A. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1209-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, NAD+-glycohydrolase (28Cockayne D.A. Muchamuel T. Grimaldi J.C. Muller-Steffner H. Randall T.D. Lund F.E. Murray R. Schuber F. Howard M.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 1324-1333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ADP/GDP-ribosyl cyclase (26Ceni C. Pochon N. Brun V. Muller-Steffner H. Andrieux A. Grunwald D. Schuber F. De Waard M. Lund F.E. Villaz M. Moutin M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) activities were not detected in Cd38 -/- brain protein extracts. To reconcile these disparate results, we have suggested that a CD38-independent ADP-ribosyl cyclase with basal activity too low to be measurable using the usual assay conditions, which could be activated by unknown cellular mechanisms, may be present in brain tissue (26Ceni C. Pochon N. Brun V. Muller-Steffner H. Andrieux A. Grunwald D. Schuber F. De Waard M. Lund F.E. Villaz M. Moutin M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have designed experimental conditions to determine very low levels of cADPR and ADPR production and have re-examined the presence of ADP-ribosyl cyclase (ADPRyl cyclase) and NADase activities in different brain extracts and in brain cells isolated from Cd38 -/- mouse. Evidence for cADPR and ADPR Synthesis in a Membrane Fraction from Cd38-/- Mouse Brain—To detect the presence of a putative enzyme distinct from CD38 and able to transform NAD+ into cADPR in murine brain tissues, we have used a sensitive assay with [14C]NAD+ as substrate, and reactions products were detected by HPLC coupled to an on-line radioactivity detector. Several fractions from brains of Cd38 -/- adult mice were tested, including total protein extract, Sol extract, and two membrane fractions obtained at low (P10 extract) and high speed (P540 extract) centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). All the enzymatic assays were performed in the presence of EDTA, which inhibits nucleotide pyrophosphatases that may hydrolyze NAD+ and the formed ADPR (31Twu J.S. Haroz R.K. Bretthauer R.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 184: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 32Johnson R.A. Salomon Y. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The extracts were tested for their ability to convert NAD+ into cADPR and ADPR after incubation at 32 °C with NAD+ for 10 min to 25 h. Different concentrations of NAD+ (6 μm, 60 μm, and 3 mm) and two pH conditions (pH 6.0 and pH 7.0) were examined. The stability of NAD+, cADPR, and ADPR was controlled within the time of measurement using standards: under our experimental conditions, the decrease in content of the standards was found to be less than 3% in 25 h (not shown). The highest cyclase and glycohydrolase activities were observed when extracts were incubated with 60 μm NAD+ at pH 6.0. Fig. 1 shows representative HPLC radiochromatograms obtained after reacting 60 μm NAD+ for 15 h at pH 6.0 with P10 (Fig. 1B), P540 (Fig. 1C), or Sol (Fig. 1D) extracts. Reactions with the P10 (Fig. 1B) and Sol (Fig. 1D) extracts yielded small peaks corresponding to ADPR and representing a conversion of 5.6 and 2.7% of NAD+, respectively. While the amount of ADPR present in the Sol extract was equivalent to the contaminating ADPR present in the sample of [14C]NAD+ used (not shown), the amount of ADPR present in the P10 membrane extract was greater and suggested that the P10 fraction had very low NADase activity. No peak corresponding to cADPR was detected with either of these extracts. In contrast, incubation of NAD+ with the P540 membranes yielded ADPR and cADPR peaks (Fig. 1C and Fig. 2A, which corresponds to a 3-fold magnification of the chromatogram shown in Fig. 1C). Under our experimental conditions, these two reaction products represented a conversion of respectively 15.4 and 1.4% of the reactive NAD+. Heat inactivation of the P540 fraction (10 min at 100 °C) before incubation with [14C]NAD+ completely abolished the formation of both products demonstrating their enzymatic origin (not shown). The identity of the ADPR peak was confirmed by treatment with nucleotide pyrophosphatase, which yielded AMP. Similarly the identity of the cADPR peak was assessed by an absence of reaction with nucleotide pyrophosphatase and its hydrolytic transformation into ADPR by heat treatment (15 min at 100 °C). Cyclic ADP-ribose and ADPR formation increased linearly with the protein concentration of the P540 extract as shown in Fig. 2B. Together these results demonstrate the presence of low basal ADPRyl cyclase and NADase activities, evocative of a multifunctional enzyme, in a protein fraction isolated from Cd38 -/- mouse brain. This P540 fraction, obtained after high speed centrifugation, was shown previously to be enriched in endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membranes (26Ceni C. Pochon N. Brun V. Muller-Steffner H. Andrieux A. Grunwald D. Schuber F. De Waard M. Lund F.E. Villaz M. Moutin M.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 175-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rates of Activities in the Membrane Fraction Isolated from Adult Cd38-/- Mouse Brain— Fig. 3 shows the time course of cADPR and ADPR production by the P540 membrane fraction at pH 6.0 (Fig. 3A) or 7.0 (Fig. 3C). At pH 6.0, both cADPR and ADPR increased linearly during the 25 h of measurement, reaching average values of 1.14 and 10.5 nmol, respectively. The deduced rates of reaction are 0.8 pmol of cADPR and 7 pmol of ADPR formed/mg of extract/min. Thus, at this pH, the ratio between ADPRyl cyclase and NADase activities is ∼1:9. At pH 7.0, cADPR and ADPR also increased linearly but more slowly than at pH 6.0, reaching average values of 0.7 and 5.8 nmol formed in 25 h. The deduced rates of reaction are 0.5 pmol of cADPR and 4 pmol of ADPR formed/mg/min. Thus, at this pH, the deduced ratio between ADPRyl cyclase and NADase activities is ∼1:8. Under these same experimental conditions, the NADase activity observed in a P540 brain extract from normal mice was approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher (4.6 nmol of product formed/mg/min, not shown). Thus under basal in vitro conditions, CD38 accounts for the vast majority of NADase activity. Interestingly minimal cADPR was formed when incubating the P540 extracts from normal mouse brains with NAD+, correlating with the ratio of 1:100 between cyclase and glycohydrolase activities of CD38 already estimated (33Takasawa S.

Searching for Chk2-binding proteins by a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified a strong interaction with karyopherin-alpha2 (KPNA-2), a gene product involved in active nuclear import of proteins bearing a nuclear localization signal (NLS). This finding was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Of the three predicted Chk2 NLSs, located at amino acids 179-182 (NLS-1), 240-256 (NLS-2), and 515-522 (NLS-3), only the latter mediated the interaction with KPNA-2 in the yeast two-hybrid system, and in particular with its C terminus. Unlike mutations in NLS-1 or NLS-2, which left the nuclear localization of Chk2 unaffected, mutations in NLS-3 caused a cytoplasmic relocalization, indicating that the NLS-3 motif acts indeed as NLS for Chk2 in vivo. Finally, co-transfection experiments with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Chk2 and wild type or mutant KPNA-2 confirmed the role of KPNA-2 in nuclear import of Chk2."
https://openalex.org/W2015756962,"Endothelial lipase (EL) influences high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism in vivo and mediates bridging and uptake of HDL particles independent of its lipolytic activity in vitro. To determine whether EL has a nonlipolytic ligand function in HDL metabolism in vivo, 1 × 1011 particles of a recombinant adenovirus encoding human EL (AdEL), catalytically inactive human EL (AdELS149A), or control (Adnull) were injected into wild-type, apoA-I transgenic, and hepatic lipase knockout mice. ELS149A protein was expressed at higher levels than wild-type EL. EL and ELS149A protein were both substantially increased in the postheparin plasma compared with preheparin, indicating that both the wild-type and mutant EL were bound to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Overexpression of wild-type EL was associated with a significantly increased postheparin-plasma phospholipase activity and dramatically decreased levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, phospholipids, and apoA-I. Injection of AdELS149A did not result in increased phospholipase activity confirming that ELS149A was catalytically inactive. Expression of ELS149A did not decrease lipid or apoA-I levels in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice yet led to an intermediate reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids in hepatic lipase-deficient mice compared with control and EL-expressing mice. Our study demonstrates for the first time that EL has both a lipolytic and nonlipolytic function in HDL metabolism in vivo. Lipolytic activity of EL, however, seems to be most important for its effects on systemic HDL metabolism. Endothelial lipase (EL) influences high density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism in vivo and mediates bridging and uptake of HDL particles independent of its lipolytic activity in vitro. To determine whether EL has a nonlipolytic ligand function in HDL metabolism in vivo, 1 × 1011 particles of a recombinant adenovirus encoding human EL (AdEL), catalytically inactive human EL (AdELS149A), or control (Adnull) were injected into wild-type, apoA-I transgenic, and hepatic lipase knockout mice.

Injection of AdELS149A did not result in increased phospholipase activity confirming that ELS149A was catalytically inactive. Expression of ELS149A did not decrease lipid or apoA-I levels in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice yet led to an intermediate reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids in hepatic lipase-deficient mice compared with control and EL-expressing mice. Our study demonstrates for the first time that EL has both a lipolytic and nonlipolytic function in HDL metabolism in vivo. Lipolytic activity of EL, however, seems to be most important for its effects on systemic HDL metabolism. Several lipolytic enzymes modulate HDL 1The abbreviations used are: HDL, high density lipoprotein; EL, endothelial lipase; LPL, lipoprotein lipase; HL, hepatic lipase; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; FFA, free fatty acids; DPPC, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; HSPGs, heparan sulfate proteoglycans. metabolism, including lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic lipase (HL), two members of the triglyceride lipase gene family. The activity of LPL is directly associated with HDL cholesterol levels in humans (1Blades B. Vega G.L. Grundy S.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1227-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but the effects of LPL on HDL metabolism are thought to be largely indirect through its effects on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. HL was shown to directly modulate HDL metabolism by converting larger HDL to smaller HDL particles through hydrolysis of both triglycerides and phospholipids (2Santamarina-Fojo S. Haudenschild C. Amar M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Independent of their lipolytic activity, LPL and HL can act in cellular lipoprotein metabolism as ligands that mediate the binding and uptake of lipoproteins via proteoglycans and/or receptor pathways. Overexpression of catalytically inactive LPL in transgenic mice resulted in increased triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particle uptake and reduced triglyceride levels (3Merkel M. Kako Y. Radner H.

Endothelial lipase (EL) is a new member of the lipase gene family (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat.

Overexpression as well as loss-of-function studies suggest that EL, like LPL and HL, plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Hepatic overexpression of EL using an adenoviral vector resulted in markedly reduced HDL cholesterol levels in mice (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Transgenic overexpression of EL under the control of the endogenous promoter resulted in modestly reduced HDL cholesterol levels (10Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D.

Conversely, inhibition of mouse EL activity in wild-type, apoA-I, and HL knockout mice using a specific antibody resulted in significantly increased HDL cholesterol and phospholipid levels (11Jin W.

In the EL knockout mouse model, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids were significantly increased (10Ishida T. Choi S. Kundu R.K. Hirata K. Rubin E.M. Cooper A.D. Quertermous T. J.

We therefore hypothesized that expression of catalytically inactive EL in vivo would result in decreased HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels. We mutated the putative active site serine 149 of EL to alanine (ELS149A). This mutation produces a normally expressed full-length but catalytically inactive enzyme. We then used a recombinant adenovirus to express catalytically inactive ELS149A in wild-type, apoA-I transgenic, and HL-deficient mice. Unexpectedly, in contrast to wild-type EL, overexpression of catalytically inactive ELS149A did not result in reduced HDL and apoA-I levels in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice. In HL-deficient mice, however, overexpression of catalytically inactive EL moderately reduced total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipid levels, consistent with the concept that EL, like LPL and HL, can modulate lipoprotein metabolism in vivo independent of its lipolytic function. Catalytic activity of EL, however, appears to be the main mechanism by which EL lowers HDL levels. Construction of Catalytically Inactive ELS149A—The catalytically inactive ELS149A was generated by mutation of the catalytic triad (Ser149-Asp173-His254) replacing the active serine 149 by alanine (ELS149A). ELS149A cDNA was generated by using site-directed mutagenesis kit (primer sense, 5′-CCACTTGATCGGCTACGCCCTCGGAGCGCACGTGGC-3′; primer antisense, 5′-GCCACGTGCGCTCCGAGGGCGTAGCCGATCAAGTGG-3′) according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. In Vitro Transfection—HEK293 cells were transfected with EL, ELS149A, or a control encoding plasmid (green fluorescent protein) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. 20 h after transfection, the transfection mixture was replaced with serum-free medium containing heparin (10 units/ml). Heparin (10 units/ml) was added again 47.5 h after transfection, and media were harvested after 48 h. Recombinant Adenovirus—The recombinant adenoviruses AdEL and Adnull were generated as described previously (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). To generate AdELS149A, ELS149A cDNA was subcloned into HindIII-XbaI restriction sites of pAdCMVlink (pAdCMVELS149A) (15Ye X. Robinson M.B. Batshaw M.L. Furth E.E. Smith I. Wilson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3639-3646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). pAdCMVELS149A was linearized with NheI and cotransfected into HEK293 cells along with adenoviral DNA digested with ClaI. Viruses were propagated in HEK293 cells, and purified by cesium chloride ultracentrifugation. The purified virus was stored in 10% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline at -80 °C. Animal Study—Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Taconic Farms; human apoA-I transgenic (C57BL/6-TgN(APOA1)1Rub) and HL-deficient mice (B6.129P2-Lipctm1Unc) were from The Jackson Laboratory. All mice were fed a chow diet. Mice (n = 4/group) were injected intravenously via the tail vein with 1 × 1011 particles of AdEL, AdELS149A, or Adnull. Blood was drawn from the retroorbital plexus after 4 h of daytime fasting before and several time points after virus injection. Post-heparin plasma was obtained at day 3 after virus injection 5 min after intravenous injection of 100 units/kg heparin. Lipid and Lipoprotein Analysis—Plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipid levels were measured enzymatically on a Cobas Fara II (Roche Diagnostics) using Sigma reagents (Sigma). Plasma apoA-I levels were quantified using an immunoturbidometric assay (Sigma) on the Cobas Fara. Gel Filtration Chromatography of Total Plasma—Pooled plasma samples (120 μl) were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences) using two Superose 6 columns in series as described (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K. South V. Amin D. Perrone M. Rader D.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and cholesterol concentrations were determined using an enzymatic assay (Wako Pure Chemical Industries). Western Blot Analysis of EL Expression—Mouse plasma samples after heparin-Sepharose treatment or conditioned media from HEK293 cells were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences), and human EL was detected with rabbit anti-EL peptide sera (1:3000) and goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated antisera (1:5000) as the secondary antibody (8Jaye M.

Lipase Assays—Triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activity were measured as described previously (16McCoy M.G. Sun G.S. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 6: 921-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Triglyceride lipase activity was measured according to a modification of the method of Nilsson-Ehle and Schotz (17Nilsson-Ehle P. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 536-541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The assay tubes contained, in a total volume of 0.3 ml, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 3.4 mm triolein, ∼250 μm phosphatidylcholine, and culture medium or mouse plasma. Samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped and products were extracted by the method of Belfrage and Vaughan (18Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The liberated fatty acids (FFAs) were quantitated by scintillation counting of a 0.5-ml aliquot of the aqueous phase. For the phospholipase activity assay, the emulsion of cholesteryl oleate (150 mg) and DPPC (8.88 mg of unlabeled and 17.15 μCi of [1,2-14C]DPPC, 110 mCi/mmol) was prepared by sonication in 2.5 ml of glycerol. The assay tubes contained, in a total volume of 0.3 ml, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.75% bovine serum albumin, 4.6 mm cholesteryl oleate, 245 μm DPPC, 0.15 m NaCl, and culture medium or mouse plasma. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped, and products were extracted by the method of Belfrage and Vaughan (18Belfrage P. Vaughan M. J. Lipid Res. 1969; 10: 341-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 100 μg of lysopalmitoylphosphatidylcholine per ml was included as carrier in the organic extraction mix. Liberation of more than 2.5 nmol of FFA/h and more than 1.5 nmol of FFA/h compared with background for the triglyceride lipase and the phospholipase assay, respectively, are consistently statistically significantly different from background (p < 0.05). Statistical Analysis—Lipase assay results are presented as means ± S.E. Graphs are presented as means ± S.D. The lipolytic properties of wild-type EL and ELS149A were first analyzed in vitro. HEK293 cells were transfected with EL, ELS149A, or control. EL and ELS149A protein were expressed at very similar levels (Fig. 1), but ELS149A had no detectable triglyceride or phospholipase activity (Table I), confirming that ELS149A was catalytically inactive.Table ILipase activity determined in conditioned media of HEK293 cells transfected with control (green fluorescent protein), EL S149A, or wild-type ELTGaTG, triglyceride; PL, phospholipid-lipasePLaTG, triglyceride; PL, phospholipid-lipasenmol/h·mlControl25 ± 5NDbND, not detectedELS149A25 ± 4NDEL172 ± 5872 ± 68a TG, triglyceride; PL, phospholipidb ND, not detected Open table in a new tab To determine the effect of ELS149A on HDL metabolism in vivo, we injected wild-type mice with 1 × 1011 particles of an adenovirus encoding EL (AdEL), ELS149A (AdELS149A), or no transgene (Adnull). Protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis in the pre- and postheparin plasma at day 3 after virus injection (Fig. 2). EL and ELS149A protein were both substantially increased in the postheparin plasma compared with preheparin, indicating that both the wild-type and mutant EL were bound to cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Overexpression of EL resulted in significantly increased phospholipase activity in postheparin plasma. In contrast, injection of AdELS149A did not result in altered triglyceride or phospholipase activity (Table II). The changes in plasma total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids during the course of the study are depicted in Fig. 3, A-C. As shown previously (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J.

In contrast, overexpression of ELS149A did not result in decreased total cholesterol or phospholipid levels compared with base line and showed slight reduction of HDL cholesterol only at day 5 after virus injection. Plasma lipoprotein profiles determined at day 10 after virus injection by FPLC analysis showed no reduction of HDL cholesterol in AdELS149A-injected mice compared with control (Fig. 3D).Table IITriglyceride (TG) and phospholipase (PL) activity determined in postheparin plasma at day 3 after injection of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with AdEL, AdEL S149A, or control (Adnull)TG-lipasePL-lipasenmol/h·mlAdnull13,051 ± 980263 ± 135AdELS149A14,231 ± 486324 ± 106AdEL12,163 ± 5475937 ± 1172 Open table in a new tab Fig. 3Total cholesterol (A), HDL cholesterol (B), and phospholipid levels (C) in wild-type mice injected with AdELS149A (diamonds), AdEL (squares), or control (triangles) over the course of the study.

Table III summarizes the postheparin triglyceride lipase and phospholipase activities at day 3 after virus injection. As expected, EL-expressing mice showed significantly increased phospholipase activity in post-heparin plasma, whereas expression of ELS149A did not result in increased phospholipase activity compared with control.

We therefore tested the hypothesis that endogenous mouse HL may also mask the effects of catalytically inactive EL, as hepatic EL and HL may have overlapping functions in HDL metabolism.

As seen in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice, EL-expressing mice showed increased phospholipase activity, whereas expression of catalytically inactive EL did not result in increased lipase activity compared with control (Table IV). Overexpression of wild-type EL resulted in a dramatic and sustained reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipid levels.

EL is a member of the triglyceride lipase gene family comprising pancreatic lipase, LPL and HL. Recent results from overexpression and loss-of-function studies suggest that EL, like other members of this gene family, plays an important role in lipoprotein metabolism (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J.

LPL and HL are bound to HSPGs and act there to either hydrolyze lipoproteins or mediate uptake of lipoproteins independent of their lipolytic activity. The clusters of positively charged residues in LPL and HL that have been implicated in heparin binding are highly conserved in EL (8Jaye M. Lynch K.J. Krawiec J. Marchadier D. Maugeais C. Doan K.

In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that EL can be released into the plasma by heparin in vivo, suggesting that EL, like LPL and HL, is anchored to the luminal endothelial surface via HSPGs. Release of EL from HSPGs is accompanied by significantly increased phospholipase activity levels. Recent in vitro data suggested that EL can promote HDL binding (13Strauss J.G. Zimmermann R.

To determine whether lipolytic activity of EL is required for its effects on HDL metabolism in vivo, we used adenoviral vectors to overexpress wild-type and catalytically inactive ELS149A in several different mouse models. ELS149A was well expressed and could be released by heparin to the same extent as wild-type EL, suggesting that neither expression nor proteoglycan binding of the mutated EL was impaired. Overexpression of wild-type EL resulted in significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids in all mouse models examined. Unexpectedly, despite even higher protein expression levels compared with wild-type EL, overexpression of ELS149A did not result in reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, phospholipid, or apoA-I levels in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice. Therefore, lipolytic activity of endothelial lipase appears to be very important for its effects on HDL metabolism. However, the possibility that catalytically inactive ELS149A may serve as a ligand to mediate the binding and uptake of lipoproteins to an extent that does not affect systemic HDL levels in these two mouse models cannot be ruled out. Importantly, overexpression of catalytically inactive EL in HL knockout mice resulted in a significant reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids that was intermediate between that observed in wild-type EL expressing mice and control, providing evidence that EL has a nonlipolytic ligand function in vivo.

Our data suggest that endogenous mouse HL not only masks the effects of catalytically inactive HL but also accounts for the lack of effect of catalytically inactive EL observed in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice. The presence of endogenous active HL may interfere with the effects of hepatic expression of catalytically inactive EL, as EL and HL may have overlapping functions in HDL metabolism. Both EL and HL were shown to mediate binding of HDL to cell-surface HSPGs in vitro (14Fuki I.V. Blanchard N. Jin W. Marchadier D.H. Millar J.S. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Biol.

The specific roles of HL versus EL in HDL metabolism are currently not very well understood. We recently proposed that HL may primarily act on triglyceride-enriched HDL particles resulting in reduction in size and increased uptake of cholesteryl esters as well as remnant HDL2 particles, whereas EL may act primarily on HDL phospholipids resulting in dissociation of apolipoproteins and subsequent catabolism (21Maugeais, C., Tietge, U. J. F., Broedl, U. C., Marchadier, D., Cain, W., McCoy, M. G., Lund-Katz, S., Glick, J. M., and Rader, D. J. (2003) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). The results of the present study, however, indicate that EL and HL have at least partially overlapping functions in HDL metabolism. Studies in EL-deficient and EL/HL double knockout mice may contribute to a better understanding of the specific roles of HL and EL in HDL metabolism. In summary, in the present study we tested the hypothesis that EL can alter HDL metabolism independent of its lipolytic function. Overexpression of wild-type EL dramatically lowered total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, phospholipid, and apoA-I levels in all mice models examined. Expression of catalytically inactive ELS149A did not reduce HDL cholesterol in wild-type and apoA-I transgenic mice but resulted in a moderate reduction of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and phospholipids in mice that were HL-deficient. We therefore conclude that EL can modulate HDL metabolism independent of its lipolytic function, yet the lipolytic activity of EL appears to be the main determinant for its effects on HDL metabolism. We thank Jeffrey Billheimer for helpful discussions. We are indebted to Anna Lillethun, Linda Morrell, Nicholle Campbell, Nadine Blanchard, and Anthony Secreto for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2171925124,"We have determined the crystal structure of YodA, an Escherichia coli protein of unknown function. YodA had been identified under conditions of cadmium stress, and we confirm that it binds metals such as cadmium and zinc. We have also found nickel bound in one of the crystal forms. YodA is composed of two domains: a main lipocalin/calycin-like domain and a helical domain. The principal metal-binding site lies on one side of the calycin domain, thus making YodA the first metal-binding lipocalin known. Our experiments suggest that YodA expression may be part of a more general stress response. From sequence analogy with the C-terminal domain of a metal-binding receptor of a member of bacterial ATP-binding cassette transporters, we propose a three-dimensional model for this receptor and suggest that YodA may have a receptor-type partner in E. coli.

The Escherichia coli protein YodA has been identified as part of the response of the bacterium to a challenge with cadmium (1Ferianc P. Farewell A. Nystrom T. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of YodA has shown a remarkable similarity with the putative bacterial proteins YrpE from Bacillus subtilis, pXO1–130 from Bacillus anthracis, and the C-terminal domain of AdcA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as some similarity with the N-terminal domain of the copperbinding amine oxidase of E. coli and Klebsiella aerogenes (2Puskarova A. Janecek S. Ferianc P. Polek B. Biologia. 2001; 56: 337-339Google Scholar). It was therefore proposed that the former group may represent a new family of cadmium stress response proteins. Cadmium is an extremely toxic heavy metal not known to have any function within living organisms. Its toxicity is twofold: it can replace divalent cations such as zinc in metalloenzymes (3Huang K.F. Chiou S.H. Ko J.M. Wang A.H.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and DNA-binding zinc finger proteins (4Petering D.H. Huang M. Moteki S. Shaw C.F.R. Mar. Environ. Res. 2000; 50: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), thus altering their normal activity. It can also provoke an oxidative stress by causing the formation of highly active oxygen radical species. Its redox potential is higher compared with biologically important metal ions such as zinc, copper, and nickel (5Vanysek P. Lide D.R. CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. Vol. 77. CRC Press, New York1997: 8Google Scholar). The oxidative stress can also be caused by cadmium replacing zinc in the active sites of proteins involved in redox pathways (6Beard S.J. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 205-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thus blocking their function. The response of microorganisms to heavy metals, such as mercury and cadmium, has been studied in some detail (1Ferianc P. Farewell A. Nystrom T.

The toxic elements are primarily removed by active transport, reducing their intracellular concentration to acceptable levels (13Rosen B.P. Essays Biochem. 1999; 34: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The extrusion of cadmium is ensured in E. coli by the product of orf732 (zntA), homologous to cadA in B. subtilis, a P-type ATPase (14Binet M.R. Poole R.K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In eucaryotes, heavy metals can be neutralized by binding to specific proteins, e.g. metallothioneins (15Vasak M. Hasler D.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Similar compounds have recently been discovered in bacteria, although the role of their homologue in E. coli, designated GatA, is not yet clear (16Blindauer C.A. Harrison M.D. Robinson A.K. Parkinson J.A. Bowness P.W. Sadler P.J. Robinson N.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1421-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In their recent study of the expression pattern of YodA, Puskarova et al. (12Puskarova A. Ferianc P. Kormanec J. Homerova D. Farewell A. Nystrom T. Microbiolog y. 2002; 148: 3801-3811Google Scholar) have identified the yodA promotor that is activated specifically by cadmium but no other heavy metal. YodA induction was shown to be dependent on soxS, fur, and relA/spoT of the stringent response but not on oxyR. YodA expression was also induced by hydrogen peroxide but after a time lag compared with the cadmium response. Although primarily a cytoplasmic protein in nonstressed cells, YodA was shown to be exported to the periplasm upon exposure to cadmium. We have solved the three-dimensional structure of the mature protein in three crystal forms: in the presence of cadmium or zinc and with no added metal ions. The protein is composed of two domains: a major domain that is structurally related to the lipocalin/calycin family of proteins (17Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) and a smaller helical domain. The central metal-binding site lies along the side of the calycin domain, buried at the interface with the helical domain, consisting of histidine side chains, similar to metalbinding sites in some proteases and oxidoreductases. Lipocalins are a growing family of small, usually secreted proteins whose main structural feature is an up-down β-barrel (18Åkerstrom B. Flower D.R. Salier J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). They have been found in all species from bacteria to man and have been associated with very diverse functions, often involved in the transport of small hydrophobic molecules. YodA can be classified as the first example of a metal-binding lipocalin implicated in response to bacterial stress. Crystallography—The protein purification and crystallization has been described elsewhere (19David G. Blondeau K. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Multiple anomalous dispersion data were collected on crystals grown in the presence of 200 mm zinc sulfate on station BM30 (FIP) at the ESRF (Grenoble, France) to 2.7 Å resolution. A further data set to 2.4 Å resolution was collected at LURE (station DW32) at 0.953 Å wavelength and used as a fourth wavelength in the phasing. Four zinc positions per asymmetric unit were refined using SHARP (20De la Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar), and after density modification with DM from the CCP4 program suite (21Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar), the electron density map could be interpreted using O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar). The diffraction data were very anisotropic, resulting in very high temperature factors in the structure. The first model obtained with experimental phases was used to phase the higher resolution data from crystals grown in the presence of 20 mm cadmium chloride (cadmium data). The program ARP/wARP (23Lamzin V.S. Wilson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 269-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) was used to automatically rebuild the cadmium model at 2.1 Å resolution. The refined cadmium model served to phase the native data (1.8 Å, collected on station 9.5 at the SRS, Daresbury, UK) and finally to refine the zinc structure. The refinement statistics from REFMAC (24Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

E. coli Strains, Growth Media, and Culture Conditions—YodA was obtained in an Applikon fermentor system in FedBatch cultures (1500 ml) of the E. coli strain BL21λ DE3-Gold (Stratagene), transformed or not with pET28b, pET28b-CyaC, or pET28b-CyaC-GroES/EL expression vectors. The cultures were performed in a synthetic medium containing 10 g/liter glycerol, 27.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 4 g/liter (NH4)2SO4, 8 g/liter KOH, 4 mg/liter thiamin, 0.4 g/liter MgSO4 (7H2O), 100 mg/liter CaCl2 (2H2O), 1 mg/liter FeSO4 (7H2O), 0.4 mg/liter ZnSO4 (7H2O), 0.4 mg/liter MnSO4, 0.04 mg/liter CuSO4 (5H2O), 0.2 mg/liter Na2MoO4, 0.5 mg/liter H3BO3, and 0.1 mg/liter KI (19David G. Blondeau K. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For the FedBatch cultures, 50 times concentrated medium was added to obtain a specific growth rate of 0.25/h and a biomass yield of 0.5g/g of glycerol 15 h later. The cultures were carried out at 37 °C at pH 7.0 with a stirring rate of 800 rpm, 1 volume of air/1 volume of culture/min. The stirring rate was finally increased to over 1200 rpm. All of the cultures were subjected to a temperature increase to 42 °C for 20 min prior to induction, to overexpress endogenous chaperone proteins. After removing a first cell sample (noninduced), the cells were induced with 0.1 mm (in Batch cultures) or 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (in FedBatch culture) during the exponential phase of bacterial growth (when the biomass attained 1 g/liter in Batch culture and 10 g/liter in FedBatch culture). The bacteria were harvested 2 h later (induced sample). Western Immunoblot Assay—Polyclonal antiserum against the purified YodA protein was prepared by injecting a rabbit subcutaneously three times at 3-week intervals. After collecting the blood, the antibody was purified from the serum on a Hi-Trap NHS-activated column (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with YodA according to the manufacturer's protocol. The specificity of the antibody was checked on a purified sample of YodA by a Western blot (26Bollag D.M. Rozycki M.D. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. 2nd Ed. Wiley-Liss, New York1996: 195-227Google Scholar). All of the Western blots were stained using the nitrotoluedine blue and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate system (Bio-Rad). YodA Structure—The three-dimensional structure of YodA consists of two domains: an antiparallel, up-down β-barrel flanked by one α-helix (the “calyx” domain), a compact domain about 20 Å × 23 Å × 26 Å in size, and a helical domain that opens out at the side of the calyx β-barrel (the “helix” domain). The latter domain is very open, with an overall size of 30 Å × 20 Å × 23 Å, with a deep cleft running down through it (Fig. 1). A visual inspection of the β-barrel domain suggests a relationship with the lipocalin-calycin family of proteins (17Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). This impression is confirmed by the results of a DALI search of existing protein structural data (27Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar), which returns several lipocalin domains, including the epididymal retinoic acid-binding protein (EPA; Protein Data Bank identification code 1EPA) (28Newcomer M.E. Pappas R.S. Ong D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9223-9227Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in the list of structurally related protein domains. We used the program TOPP from the CCP4 package (29Lu G. Protein Data Bank Quarterly Newsletter. 1996; 78: 10-11Google Scholar), which allows the superposition of molecules using their secondary structure elements regardless of sequence similarity, to carry out a careful alignment of EPA on YodA. The procedure matched all eight β-strands of the calyx domain, corresponding to 60 residues, with an root mean square distance on Cα atoms of 1.53 Å. This results in a sequence alignment with only seven identical residues, perhaps one of the lowest sequence similarities within the lipocalin family; yet all of the elements of the calycin structure are matched (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Sequence alignment of YodA with the following lipocalins: retinol-binding protein (RBP) (56Cowan S.W.

The lipocalin secondary structural elements are depicted as follows: β-strands as white characters on a black background, conserved α-helices as black on gray. The insertions in YodA are depicted in dark gray on light gray (β-strand) and white on gray (helices). The structurally conserved regions (SCR1–3) and the numbering of secondary structures as defined for lipocalins (17Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar) are indicated above the sequences, conserved residues, and YodA-specific secondary structures are indicated below the sequences. The replacement of the conserved Arg by a Pro in YodA is highlighted by an exclamation point.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relationship with lipocalins is most conserved for the N-terminal half of the structure and especially within the first signature motif (structurally conserved region 1) (17Flower D.R. North A.C.T. Sansom C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), where the strict requirement of a conserved Gly-Xaa-Trp sequence at the start of the first β-strand is fully obeyed. Even the Trp39 side chain superimposes onto the corresponding EPA Trp15 extremely well. All of the β-strands on the N-terminal side of the β-barrel superimpose rather well, although the YodA strands tend to be shorter. The superposition is somewhat less good for the second half of the β-barrel, where in the case of strands E and H, it is valid for only four residues. Conversely, the curvature of the β-strands matches more closely in the C-terminal half of the calyx domain than in the N-terminal half. Note that the conserved Arg of the lipocalin structurally conserved region 3 motif is replaced by a Pro in YodA, leaving the indole ring of Trp39 exposed to solvent. Unlike Trp15 in EPA, however, the Trp39 side chain in YodA packs against several aromatic residues filling the interior of the barrel (Fig. 3). An ordered water molecule (B = 21 Å2 in the native form, B = 7.9 Å2 in the cadmium form) lies at the top of the calyx domain, between strands A and H and the base of helix 4, securing the α-helical loop against the calyx. It forms a hydrogen bond with two backbone oxygens, one backbone nitrogen and Oγ of Ser41. This water molecule is the most buried within the interior of YodA. The two crystal forms, cadmium and “native,” superimpose nearly exactly in this region of the structure. YodA is larger than some canonical lipocalins such as EPA (193 residues for YodA compared with 162 for EPA), which is due to several sequence insertions. These occur, furthermore, between the conserved structural elements of the calyx domain: one extra β-strand extending strand D and several helices that constitute the helical domain. Helix 1 (α-helix) and an extra 310 helix form an extension at the N terminus that lies opposite α-helices 2, 3, and 4, all three forming an insertion in the sequence between β-strands A and B (Figs. 1 and 2). There is another insertion between strands G and H that forms a short α-helix at the side of the barrel (helix 5). Although most lipocalins described to date bind a hydrophobic molecule in the barrel interior, this does not seem to be the case for YodA. It is therefore interesting to compare YodA with a lipocalin with a different function, such as triabin (Protein Data Bank code 1AVG) (30Fuentes-Prior P. Noeske-Jungblut C. Donner P. Schleuning W.D. Huber R. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11845-11850Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of thrombin that acts via its surface to block the active site of the protease. The calyx barrel of triabin is very hydrophobic, with the exception of one stabilizing salt bridge, and does not contain a cavity that might accommodate other molecules. In a similar manner, the interior of the YodA calyx barrel is entirely hydrophobic with several densely packed aromatic residues. Unlike triabin, however, there are no internal polar residues within the barrel. The entrance to the wider side of the calyx is closed by a loop between helix 3 and β-strand B and a loop between β-strands E and F, restricting the opening. This loop is held in place by a disulfide bridge between strands D and E. This is very similar to triabin, and the respective cysteines lie indeed quite close in the superposition (Fig. 3). The opening is further obstructed in YodA by the side chain of Arg96 that lies across it. The narrow end of the calyx barrel is more narrow in YodA than in EPA or even triabin, with the loop between strands F and G closing over it like a lid. Interestingly, the helix 5 insertion of YodA overlaps with the N terminus of triabin in the optimized superposition. Metal-binding Sites—We have solved the structure of YodA in three crystal forms, each corresponding to different crystallization conditions. Two forms were obtained in the presence of added divalent cations, Zn2+ and Cd2+. The latter choice was influenced by our knowledge of the cadmium-induced expression of the protein. The overall structure of the three forms is practically identical (root mean square differences on Cα atoms are 0.286 Å between the native and cadmium structures and 0.594 Å between the native and zinc structures). In all of them, the N- and C-terminal helical extensions are less well ordered than the calyx domain. The N terminus is most ordered in the native form, where the electron density was interpretable from residue 7 (Gly), and least well defined in the zinc form. The latter crystal form gave highly anisotropic data with the lowest resolution, yet in this crystal form the C terminus is relatively well defined up to the last residue (His193), which is poorly ordered in the other forms. The zinc and cadmium crystal forms contain several metal ions bound to the protein. All of the sites were confirmed using the anomalous signal from data collected at appropriate wavelengths (the multiple anomalous dispersion data for the zinc form, a low resolution data-set collected at 1.7712 Å for the cadmium form) (19David G. Blondeau K. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). One central site, common to all forms, lies along the side of the calyx domain, enclosed by the helix domain. In the case of cadmium, the metal is coordinated by three histidine side chains (His144, His153, and His155, from strands F and G of the calyx domain) and three water molecules in a typical octahedral geometry (Fig. 4A). The same site accommodates two zinc ions; one is coordinated by His144 and His155, whereas the other interacts with His153, His193, and the caboxyl moiety of Glu189 (Fig. 4B). Several water molecules lie in close contact with the zinc ions, but we cannot give a precise description of the coordination geometry, because the metal ions are disordered. His153 moves slightly to accommodate the second zinc ion, whereas the C-terminal His193 becomes more ordered by binding to the metal ion. The remaining metal ions are bound on the protein surface at intermolecular sites formed by residues from two neighboring molecules. Because the packing in the two crystal forms is totally different, these sites are formed differently. Nevertheless, some of these sites have common features. One zinc ion is coordinated by His95 of one molecule and the carboxyl group of Glu93 of a symmetry-related molecule. In the cadmium form, we find one cadmium ion coordinated by His95 of one molecule and the carboxyl of Glu185 of a symmetry-related molecule, and another one is coordinated by carboxyls of Glu93 from one molecule and Glu188 of a symmetry-related molecule. The remaining zinc ion mediates contacts between the helix domains of symmetry-related molecules (carboxyl group of Asp24 of one and His75 and an oxygen of Gln47 amide group of the other molecule). The last cadmium ion also lies between symmetry-related molecules mediating a contact between the helices flanking their calyx domains (carboxyl groups of Glu169 of one and Gly171 of the other molecule). These intermolecular sites all correspond to negatively charged regions on the protein molecule (Fig. 5). To our surprise, the native crystal form revealed the presence of one metal ion bound in the central, common, metal-binding site. The ion position corresponds to that of cadmium and it is coordinated by the same three histidines (His144, His153, and His155). In this case, however, only one water molecule completes the coordination, forming a somewhat distorted tetrahedron (Fig. 4C). The presence of a metal cation indicates that this site is a high affinity metal-binding site, because no significant amount of divalent cations was added during the purification and crystallization of the protein. The binding geometry would suggest zinc as a prime candidate, although iron and copper are a possibility (all of these elements were present in the bacterial growth medium) (19David G. Blondeau K. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1243-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Another ion that was present during protein purification is nickel, because we used a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column. The crystal data were collected at a wavelength of 1.3 Å, and we found a significant anomalous peak (5.5 σ) centered on the metal site. The wavelength used corresponds to the low energy side of the zinc absorption threshold but to the high energy side for nickel, copper, and iron. To confirm the identity of the ion, we performed an x-ray fluorescence analysis of the protein solution, as used for crystallization. The major component was nickel, with a negligible signal for copper and iron, whereas zinc give a signal only 0.25 of that of nickel. We therefore conclude that the metal bound in this case is nickel, in an unusual, distorted tetrahedral geometry. It has to be noted that the ligand geometry for nickel in proteins has not been studied very carefully to date. Upon examination of the available data (via the Metalloprotein Data Base) (31Castagnetto J.M. Hennessy S.W. Roberts V.A. Getzoff E.D. Tainer J.A. Pique M.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), we found two other cases of distorted tetrahedral geometry of nickel ion ligands from high resolution protein crystal structure determinations: azurin (1NZR) (32Nar H. Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Van De Kamp M. Canters G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 427Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and a complex of trypsin with ecotin (1SLW) (33McGrath M.E. Erpel T. Bystroff C. Fletterick R.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1502-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). YodA Expression Results—YodA had been identified in the past in E. coli cells under two different sets of conditions. Ferianc et al. (1Ferianc P. Farewell A. Nystrom T. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 1045-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) found an increase of YodA expression when submitting E. coli to increased levels of cadmium in the medium, whereas Laurent-Winter et al. (34Laurent-Winter C. Ngo S. Danchin A. Bertin P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 767-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) observed a decrease of YodA expression in E. coli mutants defective in the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein. The latter study would suggest a basal level of YodA expression in E. coli cells. Because neither case corresponds to our experimental conditions, we wished to ascertain, if possible, the factor(s) responsible for the overproduction of YodA in our hands. We initially obtained YodA when in fact attempting to overexpress a heterologous protein in E. coli (CyaC from Bordetella pertussis (19David G. Blondeau K. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A.

Because cardiac hypertrophy also involves integrin activation, we analyzed whether integrins could contribute to S6K1 activation. Using adult feline cardiomyocytes, here we report that integrin-interacting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides activate S6K1 as observed by band shifting, kinase activity and phosphorylation at Thr-389 and Thr-421/Ser-424 of S6K1, and S6 protein phosphorylation. Perturbation of specific integrin function with blocking antibodies and by overexpressing the β1A cytoplasmic tail revealed that β3 but not β1 integrin mediates the RGD-induced S6K1 activation. This activation is focal adhesion complex-independent and is accompanied by the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Studies using specific inhibitors and dominant negative c-Raf expression in cardiomyocytes indicate that the S6K1 activation involves mTOR, MEK/ERK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways and is independent of protein kinase C and c-Raf. Finally, addition of fluorescent-labeled RGD peptide to cardiomyocytes exhibits its internalization and localization to the endocytic vesicles, and pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with endocytic inhibitors reduced the S6K1 activation. These data suggest that RGD interaction with β3 integrin and its subsequent endocytosis trigger specific signaling pathway(s) for S6K1 activation in cardiomyocytes and that this process may contribute to hypertrophic growth and remodeling of myocardium.

Cell growth involves orchestrated events leading to accumulation of cell mass that is accompanied by a proportional increase in cell size and is modulated significantly by the extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; β-gal, β-galactosidase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase; CSK, cytoskeletal; TPA, tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; PIP, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PO, pressure overload; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDK, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20.1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; β-gal, β-galactosidase; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase; CSK, cytoskeletal; TPA, tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate; PKC, protein kinase C; PKA, protein kinase A; PIP, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; AKT, protein kinase B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PO, pressure overload; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; PDK, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase; BIM, bisindolylmaleimide; TBST, Tris-buffered saline plus Tween 20. environment. An increase in total protein content, which is greatly influenced by translational control mechanisms, is a hallmark of cell growth (1Neufeld T.P. Edgar B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 784-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 2Assoian R.K. Schwartz M.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). In the case of proliferative cells, translational activation is important for the transition from G0/G1 to S phase. However, adult cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes), which are terminally differentiated, undergo predominantly hypertrophic growth in response to an applied stress (3Cooper IV, G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1987; 49: 501-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Such hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes, as observed in an adult feline right ventricular pressure overload model, is associated with an overall increase in the size and mass of cardiomyocytes via translational activation (4Mann D.L. Kent R.L. Cooper IV, G. Circ. Res. 1989; 64: 1079-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 5Marino T.A. Houser S.R. Cooper IV, G. Anat.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8359-8364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Multiple pathways including the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase A (PKA), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) contribute to cardiac hypertrophy (7Molkentin J.D. Dorn 2nd., I.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2001; 63: 391-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar, 8Hoshijima M. Chien K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). One major converging point for these pathways is S6K1, whose activation has been shown to result in increased biogenesis of translational components. By phosphorylating the 40 S ribosomal S6 protein (S6 protein), S6K1 is reported to enhance the translation of mRNA possessing unique 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine sequences in the 5′-untranslated region. 5′-Terminal oligopyrimidine mRNAs generally encode ribosomal proteins, thereby increasing the overall translational capacity of cells (9Volarevic S. Thomas G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol Biol. 2001; 65: 101-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic knockout of S6K1 resulted in small organism phenotypes in mouse (10Shima H. Pende M. Chen Y. Fumagalli S. Thomas G. Kozma S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6649-6659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Drosophila (11Montagne J. Stewart M.J. Stocker H. Hafen E. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 1999; 285: 2126-2129Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar); such findings emphasize the important role of S6K1 in determining cell growth and size. Considering the prominent role played by S6K1 in cell growth, this kinase can be anticipated to play a significant role during cardiac hypertrophy as well. There are two isoforms of S6K1, both expressed by the same gene because of alternative start sites: a 70-kDa isoform, which is predominantly cytoplasmic, and an 85-kDa isoform, which has 23 additional N-terminal residues that direct it to the nucleus. S6K1 activation requires modular phosphorylation at multiple sites dispersed throughout the molecule, and its regulation is controlled spatiotemporally by several different kinases and phosphatases (12Pullen N. Thomas G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Of these phosphorylation sites, Ser-411, Thr-421, and Ser-424 in the pseudosubstrate domain, Thr-389 and Ser-404 in the linker region, and Thr-229 and Ser-371 in the catalytic domain have been well characterized. For example, the phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate domain is mediated via proline-directed protein kinases, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK) (13Mukhopadhyay N.K. Price D.J. Kyriakis J.M. Pelech S. Sanghera J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3325-3335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); Thr-389 phosphorylation is under the control of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (14Pearson R.B. Dennis P.B. Han J.W. Williamson N.A. Kozma S.C. Wettenhall R.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar); and Thr-229 phosphorylation is primarily mediated by the constitutively active phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase (PDK1) (15Weng Q.P.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) in hypertrophying myocardium revealed that S6K1 undergoes activation as early as 30 min after the onset of pressure overload (PO) and persists up to 48 h. Although our subsequent studies (17Iijima Y. Laser M. Shiraishi H. Willey C.D. Sundaravadivel B. Xu L. McDermott P.J. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23065-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) show S6K1 activation is initiated by a PKC/c-Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, the sustained activation of this kinase could be mediated by additional signaling events. In this context, we also demonstrated integrin activation and focal adhesion complex formation 4–48 h after PO (18Kuppuswamy D. Kerr C. Narishige T. Kasi V.S. Menick D.R. Cooper IV, G. J. Biol.

Ubiquitously expressed on the cell surface as αβ heterodimers, integrins mediate both outside-in and inside-out signaling. Integrins, apart from being critical for cell adhesion, regulate a vast array of signaling events including mechanical sensing, translational activation, cell growth, and tissue remodeling. In addition to differences arising from the extracellular milieu and cell type, the diversity in integrin signaling is attributed in part to the pairing of α and β subunits, because 8 different α subunits and 12 different β subunits constitute at least 24 integrin subtypes (20Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). Binding of integrins to ECM ligands results in occupancy of integrin-ligand binding sites and triggers an increase in lateral integrin clustering. These events not only initiate adhesion and cytoskeletal organization via direct physical association of integrins with structural proteins, but also activate many intracellular signaling pathways that regulate numerous cellular processes (21Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3757) Google Scholar). A majority of integrin-ligand interactions known to date are mediated through the Arg-Gly-Asp motifs of the respective ECM ligands. These motifs are either conformationally exposed or buried inside the three-dimensional structure of the intact ligands, and often proteolytic cleavage of the ECM proteins results in the exposure of many of the cryptic sites for interaction with integrins (22Davis G.E.

In the myocardium, expression of specific integrins is down-regulated during postnatal growth and re-expression occurs upon hypertrophic stimulation. In models of cardiac hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and myocardial infarction, dramatic changes occur in the arrangement of ECM components and integrins (reviewed in Ref. 29Ross R.S. Borg T.K. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1112-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Of the various integrin subtypes expressed in cardiac muscle cells, stimulation of α5β1 (30Ross R.S. Pham C. Shai S.Y.

In mice, heart-specific ablation of β1 integrin results in severe cardiac abnormalities including myocardial fibrosis, depressed contractility and relaxation, intolerance of transverse aortic constriction, and development of cardiomyopathy (31Shai S.Y. Harpf A.E. Babbitt C.J. Jordan M.C. Fishbein M.C. Chen J. Omura M. Leil T.A. Becker K.D. Jiang M. Smith D.J. Cherry S.R. Loftus J.C. Ross R.S. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). This model demonstrates the importance of the β1 integrin subtype in hypertrophic growth. However, the nature of the role played by β3 integrin in hypertrophying cardiomyocytes is yet to be understood, although our studies in pressure-overloaded myocardium demonstrate β3 integrin activation and complex formation with signaling proteins at the focal adhesion sites (18Kuppuswamy D.

Because we initially observe S6K1 activation in pressure overload myocardium, which is subsequently accompanied by integrin activation and focal complex formation, we hypothesized that the latter event might contribute to the sustained activation of the former. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments to address the following questions: (i) can integrin ligation result in S6K1 activation in adult cardiomyocytes, (ii) if so, which integrin subtype is responsible for the activation, (iii) is focal adhesion complex formation necessary in this process, and (iv) what is the mechanism underlying S6K1 activation? Our study indicates that RGD stimulation of β3 integrin can lead to S6K1 activation and that integrin-mediated endocytosis of RGD might contribute significantly to this activation process.

Unless otherwise specified, 105 cells were plated on 35-mm tissue culture dishes (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ) coated with laminin (20 μg/ml, BD Biosciences) in Medium 199 (M199) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). In all experiments, the cells were maintained at 37 °Cin humidified air with 5% CO2. To compare the cytoskeletal assembly and activation of c-Src and FAK, freshly isolated adult cardiomyocytes were embedded three-dimensionally in type I collagen in the presence or absence of 9 mm RGD peptide for 1 h, as we described previously (19Laser M.

Adenoviral Infection of Cardiomyocytes—The following adenoviruses were constructed and used before in our laboratories: β-galactosidase (β-gal) and dominant negative c-Raf (C4B) (17Iijima Y. Laser M. Shiraishi H. Willey C.D. Sundaravadivel B. Xu L. McDermott P.J. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol.

Heidecker G. Rapp U.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). In addition, an adenovirus encoding a TAC-β1A chimera, which is a product of the cytoplasmic domain of human β1A integrin fused with the transmembrane and extracellular domains (TAC subunit) of the human interleukin-2 receptor (a generous gift from Dr. Robert Ross, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) (30Ross R.S. Pham C. Shai S.Y. Goldhaber J.I. Fenczik C. Glembotski C.C. Ginsberg M.H. Loftus J.C. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 1160-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), was propagated in our laboratories. In experiments involving adenoviral infection, cardiomyocytes plated on laminin-coated dishes for 4 h were infected with the indicated adenovirus in Piper's medium (M199 containing 2% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm creatine, 2 mm l-carnitine, 5 mm taurine, 0.25 mm l-ascorbate, 10 μm AraC, 40 nm insulin (all obtained from Sigma), and 200 units/ml penicillin and 200 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen)). The multiplicities of infection (m.o.i.) used in the present study were 250 (C4B) and 30 (TAC-β1A). Cells infected with an equal m.o.i. of β-gal adenovirus served as controls. After 12–16 h, the medium was replenished, and ∼36 h after infection the medium was changed to M199 and incubated for 2 h prior to peptide treatment (see below). Stimulation of S6K1 in Adult Cardiomyocytes—Cardiomyocytes cultured either overnight or infected with adenoviruses for 36 h were replenished with fresh M199 and incubated for 2 h prior to treatment with peptides. The cells were treated with RGD or RGE peptide (dissolved in M199, pH adjusted to 7.4, and centrifuged to remove any undissolved particles) at indicated concentrations for 1 h unless specified otherwise. In experiments using pharmacological inhibitors, cells were pretreated with the specified inhibitors as indicated in figure legends and treated with peptides in the presence or absence of inhibitors. In the case of integrin function blocking, cardiomyocytes were preincubated with specified function-blocking or control antibodies at a concentration of 50 μg/ml for 30 min and then treated with RGD or RGE peptides in the presence or absence of function-blocking antibodies for 1 h. Preparation of Cell Lysate—After treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and the soluble and cytoskeletal (CSK) fractions were prepared as described previously (19Laser M. Willey C.D.

Briefly, the cells were scraped in cold Triton X-100 extraction buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2% Triton X-100 containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures) and centrifuged at 16,000 × g to obtain the supernatant representing the detergent-soluble fraction to which an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer was added and boiled. The insoluble pellet was washed with the extraction buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer to obtain the CSK fraction. In the case of three-dimensionally cultured cardiomyocytes, cells were recovered from collagen gels by collagenase treatment, and soluble and insoluble samples were prepared as described previously (19Laser M.

Western Blotting—Soluble and/or CSK fractions of cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on either conventional gels (10%) or on Nupage (Invitrogen) gels. Resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and blocked with a solution of 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% bovine serum albumin prepared in Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 (TBST) (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. The desired primary antibody was diluted in TBST, added to the blocked membrane, and shaken for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. After washing the membranes three times with TBST for 5 min each, appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in TBST was added to the membranes and shaken for 1 h at room temperature. The unbound secondary antibody was removed by five 5-min washes in TBST, and the protein bands were detected using Renaissance enhanced chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In all Western blotting analyses, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase level was used to show protein loading. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For S6K1 activity, cytosolic samples from control, RGD-, RGE-, and insulin-treated cardiomyocytes were prepared as we described previously (16Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G.t. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and S6K1 was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal anti-S6K1 antibody (C-18, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Immune complex-bound kinase activity was then measured using a synthetic substrate peptide, RRRLSSLRA (35Terada N. Franklin R.A. Lucas J.J. Blenis J. Gelfand E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12062-12068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as we described previously (16Laser M. Kasi V.S. Hamawaki M. Cooper G.t. Kerr C.M. Kuppuswamy D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24610-24619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation and assays were performed in duplicate, and the results are shown as mean ± S.D. Measurement of PI3K Activity—To measure the PI3K activity in cardiomyocytes, two approaches were taken: (i) the active pool of PI3K was immunoprecipitated using PY-biotin (biotin-labeled phosphotyrosine) antibody and then immunoblotted for the presence of p85 isoform of PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and (ii) the lipid kinase activity was assayed in immunoprecipitates obtained using a polyclonal antibody against p85 isoform of PI3K (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) as reported earlier with minor modifications (16Laser M.

Briefly, to measure the kinase activity, cardiomyocytes (4 × 106), after stimulation with RGD, RGE, or insulin, were extracted using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The extract was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The cleared supernatant was rotated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg of an antibody raised against the p85 subunit of PI3K. Immune complex was bound to protein A-agarose beads (Pierce) by gently rotating at 4 °C for 1 h and washed as follows: three times with the extraction buffer; three times with 0.1 m Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm LiCl and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate; and twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate. After washing, the beads were assayed for PI3K enzyme activity using phosphatidylinositol (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (Easy Tides, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as substrates. The organic phase containing lipid products was separated by TLC on silica gel LK6D using chloroform/methanol/water/ammonia (60:47:11:3.2, v/v/v/v) as the solvent system. Unlabeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP) detected in TLC using iodine vapor served as a control to determine the position of radiolabeled PIP. The TLC plate was then autoradiographed. Fluorescent Labeling of Peptides—RGD and RGE peptides were labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 as described by Perlot et al. (36Perlot Jr., R.L. Shapiro I.M. Mansfield K. Adams C.S. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 66-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using the Alexa Fluor 594 protein labeling kit (Molecular Probes). Briefly the peptide was dissolved in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate, added to succinimidyl ester derivative of Alexa Fluor 594 dissolved in 100 mm sodium bicarbonate (in a peptide:dye molar ratio of 40:1), and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The resulting peptide-dye conjugate was separated from free dye by TLC on silica gel PLKC18F using acetonitrile:water (85:15, v/v). The peptide-dye conjugate exhibited a slower migration than free dye when monitored under UV light. The area corresponding to the conjugated peptide was scraped and eluted from silica gel using acetonitrile:water (85:15, v/v). The solution was then lyophilized and reconstituted in M199. Internalization of Alexa Fluor 594-labeled RGD—Cardiomyocytes plated on laminin-coated chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were incubated overnight at 37 °C as above, and treated with either RGD- or RGE-Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate for various periods as indicated in the figure legends. After the incubation period, the cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed in 4% formaldehyde. Fixed cells were then mounted in Anti-Fade (Molecular Probes) and subjected to laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM GB 200; Olympus Optical Co Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Image"
https://openalex.org/W2060735192,"Neurotrophins are required for the differentiation and survival of several different neuronal subpopulations in the developing nervous system. The PC12 cell line responds to nerve growth factor (NGF) by withdrawing from the cell cycle and acquiring a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. Previous studies have shown that the activation kinetics of the NGF receptor, TrkA, and downstream protein kinases appear rapid and seemingly transient after NGF treatment of naive PC12 cells. However, maintenance of the neuronal phenotype and survival of differentiated PC12 cells under serum-free conditions require constant NGF exposure. In this study we have addressed the mechanisms that NGF uses to maintain neuronal PC12 cells. We show that TrkA remains phosphorylated at a basal level throughout differentiation of the PC12 cells. The phospho-TrkA levels in the differentiated PC12 cells were diminished by both complete NGF withdrawal and pharmacological inhibition of Trk kinase activity. Intracellular sequestration of the majority of TrkA molecules (both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TrkA) and persistent dephosphorylation of the small pool of cell surface TrkA renders the persistent phospho-TrkA signal in the differentiated PC12 cells resistant to partial NGF withdrawal as well as exposure to additional NGF. NGF regulated both extracellular-regulated kinases 1/2 and Akt activity in the differentiated PC12 cells via sustained TrkA activity. Moreover, analysis of transcription using activating protein 1-, serum response element-, and cyclic AMP response element-Luc reporter constructs showed that NGF regulated these promoters through TrkA activity in differentiated PC12 cells. Interestingly, the initial response of the cyclic AMP response element promoter to NGF was delayed, becoming Trk-dependent well beyond the peaks in TrkA and downstream protein kinase signal transduction.

Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These effects are largely mediated through activation of the TrkA receptor, which initiates a cascade of signaling events that includes activation of several downstream protein kinases and transcription factors (2Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These early events are thought to generate the long term changes in gene expression needed for acquisition of a mature neuronal phenotype. Mature or adult neurons are also exposed to and responsive to neurotrophins like NGF, but their biological responses may be quite distinct from those of an immature neuron. For example, developing nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion require NGF for survival (3Ruit K.G. Elliott J.L. Osborne P.A. Yan Q. Snider W.D. Neuron. 1992; 8: 573-587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). NGF alters neurite outgrowth, gene induction, and the responsiveness of adult nociceptive neurons to some stimuli, but it is apparently not necessary for their survival (4Lindsay R. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Malcangio M. Garrett N.E. Cruwys S. Tomlinson D.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8459-8467Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mohiuddin L. Fernandez K. Tomlinson D.R. Fernyhough P. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 185: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Much effort has been devoted toward understanding how NGF and other neurotrophins bring about their biological effects in both the developing and adult nervous systems. Most studies of neurotrophin signal transduction have focused on how these ligands activate intracellular signals. However, activity of the intracellular mediators that the neurotrophins use must somehow be maintained to generate their lasting biological effects. The NGF-responsive PC12 cell line has been used extensively for analysis of neurotrophin signal transduction. NGF induces the differentiation of PC12 cells into a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype (7Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1978; 78: 747-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Both survival and phenotypic maintenance of the differentiated or “neuronal” PC12 cells require continual exposure to NGF (8Burstein D.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Previous studies using either activating and dominant negative signaling proteins or pharmacological inhibitors argue that sustained activity of Erk1/2 and/or PI3K is required to maintain survival of differentiated PC12 cells (2Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 9Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud R. Davis R. Greenberg M. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar, 10Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). However, there are exceedingly few examples where the activity of intracellular signal transduction pathways in differentiated PC12 cells has been directly demonstrated. Even when NGF is continually present and its receptors are available to bind ligand, activation of TrkA appears to be a relatively short-lived event in the PC12 cells. TrkA activity falls dramatically over a few hours' time following the large peak activity at 5 min after initial NGF exposure (11Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Comparing the kinetics of Erk1/2 activation in PC12 cells treated with NGF versus mitogenic stimuli has led to the conclusion that prolonged activation of Erk1/2 drives NGF-dependent differentiation of PC12 cells (12Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). NGF-dependent activation of Erk1/2 is initially activated by Ras, and then prolonged activity is maintained by Rap 1. Mitogenic stimuli such as epidermal growth factor only stimulate Ras activity in the PC12 cells so Erk1/2 activity is not maintained for hours as seen after NGF stimulation (14York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). However, because the increased activity of Erk1/2 seen after NGF treatment takes place over the course of hours, this cannot explain the means that NGF uses to drive neuronal differentiation over the days of ligand exposure needed for this phenotypic transition (8Burstein D.E. Greene L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6059-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 15Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). Here, we show that the NGF receptor, TrkA, remains phosphorylated on residues that correspond to the activated receptor in PC12 cells treated with NGF for 1–7 days. As long as NGF is present, TrkA activity is greater than that seen in naive PC12 cells. Continual NGF exposure also sustains a basal, homeostatic level of Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation on activating residues, and this requires persistent TrkA activity. Thus, NGF maintains a basal level of activity in both its receptor and downstream signaling pathways well beyond the rapid activation kinetics that have been previously ascribed to neurotrophin signal transduction. Using stably transfected PC12 cell lines, we further show that this basal TrkA activity regulates transcription through CRE, SRE, and AP-1 promoter elements in the differentiated PC12 cells. Although previous studies show that the CRE-binding protein (CREB) is rapidly activated by NGF treatment in naive PC12 cells (16Bonni A. Ginty D.D. Dudek H. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1995; 6: 168-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), we show that transcription from a CRE reporter construct does not become TrkA-dependent until well beyond the initial burst of TrkA activity. This argues that the new basal level of TrkA tyrosine kinase activity that is reached after the first day of NGF treatment is biologically relevant for both activating and maintaining gene expression in the differentiating PC12 cells. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6% horse serum and 6% bovine calf serum (Hyclone) at 7% CO2,37 °C. For NGF treatment, PC12 cells were plated on collagen-coated dishes in complete media for at least 6 h and then switched to serum-free conditions consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin supplemented with 50 ng/ml NGF (Harlan Bioscience). Medium and NGF were replenished every 2 days. Medium changes were performed at least 24 h before any experiments in NGF-treated cells to ensure that a basal state of signaling had been reached. For pharmacological inhibition of Trk, MEK1, or PI3K activity in naive cells, cultures were pretreated with 200 nm K252a (Calbiochem), 50 μm PD98059 (Biomol), or 50 μm LY294002 (Biomol), respectively, for 30 min before the addition of NGF; in PC12 cells that had been treated with NGF for ≥24 h, inhibitors were added directly to culture media. For control, cells were treated with an equal volume of vehicle (Me2SO). The stably transfected PC12 clones described below were treated in the same fashion. Transfection and Characterization of Transcriptional Activity—PC12 cells were co-transfected with the pAP1-Luc, pCRE-Luc, or pSRE-Luc (Stratagene) plus pSV3-neo plasmids using LipofectAMINEplus (Invitrogen). Stable clones were selected in 400 μg/ml G418 and maintained in 100 μg/ml G418 as previously described (17Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Twiss J.L. Wada H.G. Fok K.S. Chan S.D.H. Verity A.N. Baxter G.T. Shooter E.M. Sussman H.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Stable clones were chosen for further experiments based upon an appropriate induction of luciferase activity using known activators of these reporter elements (see “Results”). AP-1-Luc and SRE-Luc clones were treated with 1 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). CRE-Luc clones were treated with 1 μm dibutyryl-cAMP (Bt2cAMP) (Sigma) for 5 h. Reporter activity was assessed by luminometry using a commercial luciferase assay kit (Promega). The protein concentration of each lysate was determined by Bradford assay, and the luciferase activities, measured in relative light unit values, were normalized for protein content in each sample. In the naive clones, accumulation of luciferase activity after 5 h of NGF stimulation was used as a measure of AP-1-, SRE-, and CRE-dependent transcription. Analysis of relative transcriptional activity in differentiated clones required consideration of decay of both luciferase mRNA and protein. 20 h proved the optimal duration of anti-NGF or K252a treatment for assessing relative transcriptional activity from the AP-1, SRE, and CRE promoter elements. Titration of Neutralizing anti-NGF Antibody and NGF Withdrawal—Neutralizing anti-NGF antibody was titrated in PC12 cells using phosphorylation of TrkA at 5 min as a biological measure of NGF levels. For this, 50 ng/ml NGF was incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin with serial dilutions of rabbit anti-NGF antibody for 20 min. Naive PC12 cells were then treated with the NGF/anti-NGF antibody mixtures for 5 min, washed twice in ice-cold PBS, and processed for immunoblotting. For NGF neutralization in NGF-treated cultures, PC12 cell cultures were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF for the indicated durations, and then the anti-NGF antibody was added directly to culture medium as indicated under “Results.” Immunoblotting—Cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm para-nitrophenol phosphate, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (17Canossa M. Twiss J.L. Verity A.N. Shooter E.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3369-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Twiss J.L. Wada H.G. Fok K.S. Chan S.D.H. Verity A.N. Baxter G.T. Shooter E.M. Sussman H.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 51: 442-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). After clearing at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, lysates were normalized for protein content using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h followed by an overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer as follows: rabbit anti-TrkPY490 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-TrkA-ex (1:10,000 (19Molliver D.C. Radeke M.J. Feinstein S.C. Snider W.D. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 361: 404-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar)); rabbit anti-active MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) (1:5000; Promega), rabbit anti-Erk1/2 (1:10,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-AktPS473 (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-Akt (1: 1000; Cell Signaling Technology), and rabbit anti-eIF5 (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membranes were then washed in Tris-buffered saline plus 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 60 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology). Reactive bands were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence per the manufacturer's instructions (ECLplus; Amersham Biosciences). Cell Surface Biotinylation—Isolation of cell surface proteins was performed essentially as previously described with minor modifications (20Bush G. diSibio G. Miyamoto A. Denault J.B. Leduc R. Weinmaster G. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 494-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, naive or differentiated PC12 cells were rinsed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and then incubated with either PBS alone (non-biotinylated controls) or PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) for 2 h at 4 °C. The biotin solution was removed and replaced with ice-cold Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (containing glutamine) for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were gently rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed as described above. The lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and then cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm, 4 °C for 15 min. Biotinylated proteins were precipitated by adding 40 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads (Molecular Probes) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The streptavidin-agarose beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 5 times with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS before resuspension in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Precipitated proteins were then resolved on 8% SDS, PAGE gels and then processed for immunoblotting as described above. Blots were reprobed with a rabbit anti-eIF5 antibody to ensure that the proteins detected in the streptavidin-agarose precipitates did not arise from inadvertent cell lysis during the biotinylation procedure. Survival Assays—Survival assays were performed 24–48 h after NGF withdrawal using the methylthiazoletetrazolium assay as previously described with some modifications (21Berg K. Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. APMIS. 1990; 98: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 22Hansen M.B. Nielsen S.E. Berg K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1989; 119: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3343) Google Scholar). Briefly, methylthiazoletetrazolium reagent (Sigma) was added to cultures at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml, and the cultures were placed at 37 °C, 7% CO2 for 2 h. Media was then removed, and the insoluble blue reaction product was solubilized in Me2SO. Optical densities of the medium containing solubilized methylthiazoletetrazolium reagent were measured at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. TrkA Remains Activated over the Course of Neuronal Differentiation in PC12 Cells—Previous studies show that the initial stimulation of TrkA phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways in PC12 cells exposed to NGF is rapid but transient despite continued NGF exposure (11Kaplan D.R. Martin-Zanca D. Parada L.F. Nature. 1991; 350: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 23Zhou J. Valletta J.S. Grimes M.L. Mobley W.C. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies in our PC12 cell isolate showed similar rapid activation kinetics of TrkA and downstream signaling cascades (Fig. 1). Activation of TrkA, determined by phosphorylation of tyrosine 490 (TrkPY490), peaked within 5 min of NGF addition and fell dramatically over the subsequent 15 h (Fig. 1A). Activation of Erk1/2, detected using an antibody specific for Erk phosphorylated on threonine 183 and tyrosine 185 (Erk1/2PT183/PY185), followed a similar time course (Fig. 1B). Consistent with prior reports, Erk1/2PT183/PY185 stays at relatively high levels up to 6 h after NGF treatment (12Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 13Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr.

J. 1992; 288: 351-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Similarly, levels of Akt phosphorylated at serine 473 (AktPS473) remained elevated for up to 15 h after NGF treatment (Fig. 1C) but fell to low levels by 24 h (data not shown). Despite the seemingly transient increase in TrkA activity above, we were able to detect levels of phosphorylated TrkA at 1, 2, and even 7 days after the initial NGF exposure, and these signals were clearly distinguished from any TrkPY490 levels in unstimulated PC12 cells (Fig. 2A, lanes 5–8). Because the TrkPY490 signal was comparable at all of the time points after 24 h, this suggests that TrkA reaches a basal level of activity that persists over the entire course of neuronal differentiation in the PC12 cells. Total TrkA levels, detected with antibodies that recognize both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated TrkA remained relatively unchanged over the course of differentiation (Fig. 2A, lower panel). Exposure of 7-day NGF-differentiated PC12 cells to an additional 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 min, which is the initial time point of peak TrkA activity seen in NGF-treated naive PC12 cells (see Fig. 1), did not increase the levels of phospho-TrkA detected (Fig. 2A, lanes 7–8). Supplementing the 7-day NGF-differentiated cultures with an additional 50 ng/ml NGF for longer durations did not increase phospho-TrkA levels (10 min to 6 h; data not shown), arguing that TrkA does not exhibit altered activation kinetics in the differentiated PC12 cells. Total TrkA levels did not change significantly over the course of NGF differentiation in this experiment, indicating that only a fraction of TrkA receptors are activated at any one time in the differentiated PC12 cells. The persistent TrkPY490 signal in the 7-day differentiated PC12 cells is ∼15-fold less than that seen upon initial peak activation of TrkA in naive PC12 cells (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the TrkPY490 signal that we had detected in the differentiated PC12 cells above is not due to nonspecific recognition of unphosphorylated TrkA by the anti-TrkPY490 antibody, we treated differentiated PC12 cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor K252a. In naive PC12 cells, 200 nm K252a completely blocks NGF-dependent activation of TrkA and downstream signaling cascades (25Berg M.M. Sternberg D.W. Parada L.F. Chao M.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Smith D.S. King C.S. Pearson E. Gittinger C.K. Landreth G.E. J. Neurochem. 1989; 53: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 27Tapley P. Lamballe F. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 371-381PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of 7-day differentiated PC12 cells with 200 nm K252a diminished the TrkPY490 signal within as little as 2 h (Fig. 2B, lane 9, and Fig. 5A, lane 2). Thus, the TrkPY490 signal that we detected in the differentiated PC12 cells represents a sustained activation of the TrkA kinase. Persistent TrkA Phosphorylation Is NGF-dependent in Differentiated PC12 Cells—To determine whether the TrkA phosphorylation that we observed in the differentiated PC12 cells is NGF-dependent, we used a neutralizing anti-NGF antibody to withdraw NGF from 7-day differentiated PC12 cells. The anti-NGF antibody was titrated in naive PC12 cells to determine the amount required to effectively neutralize 50 ng/ml NGF. 1:500 dilution of anti-NGF antibody was sufficient to completely block NGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA (Fig. 3A, lane 1). 1:2500 dilution of anti-NGF antibody partially neutralized the 50 ng/ml NGF solution (Fig. 3A, lane 6, top panel), decreasing TrkPY490 to approximate levels seen with 5 ng/ml NGF treatment (Fig. 3A, lane 4, lower panel). In the differentiated PC12 cells, anti-NGF antibody decreased TrkPY490 levels at 2 h and completely depleted the TrkPY490 signal by 24 h (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 6). The 1:2500 anti-NGF antibody treatment did not cause a discernable change in the level of TrkPY490 in the differentiated cells even after long term antibody treatment (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 5) despite that the 1:2500 dilution of anti-NGF caused ∼80% reduction of TrkA activation in the naive PC12 cells. Taken together with the NGF supplementation experiment shown in Fig. 2, these data suggest that basal TrkA phosphorylation in differentiated PC12 cells is less susceptible to varying ligand concentrations than is initial activation of TrkA in naive cells. The Majority of TrkA Receptors Are Intracellular in Differentiated PC12 Cells—The relative resistance of the basal TrkPY490 signal to additional ligand or partial removal of ligand in the differentiated PC12 cells (Figs. 2 and 3) could be explained by receptor internalization after prolonged and continuous exposure to NGF. Recent studies from several different groups indicate that internalized TrkA remains activated residing in “signaling endosomes” (28Ye H. Kuruvilla R. Zweifel L.S. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2003; 39: 57-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 29Delcroix J.D. Valletta J.S. Wu C. Hunt S.J. Kowal A.S. Mobley W.C.

To address the possibility that TrkA was internalized in the differentiated PC12 cells, we analyzed the relative level of TrkA on the cell surface of the differentiated PC12 cells. Consistent with reports demonstrating that receptor activation triggers internalization (31Grimes M.L. Zhou J. Beattie E.C. Yuen E.C. Hall D.E. Valletta J.S. Topp K.S. LaVail J.H. Bunnett N.W. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7950-7964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Beattie E.C. Howe C.L. Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. Mobley W.C. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7325-7333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that TrkA rapidly leaves the surface of naive PC12 cells upon NGF stimulation. After 7 days of continual NGF treatment, we could not detect TrkA among the streptavidin-precipitated cell surface proteins (Fig. 4A, lower panel). The level of total TrkA levels in cell lysates remained relatively unchanged over the 7-day course of NGF treatment (Fig. 4A, upper panel). The cell surface levels of activated TrkA decreased with similar kinetics to that of cell surface TrkA (Fig. 4A, lower panel). This indicates that the vast majority of the TrkA receptors, regardless of activation state, are intracellular after long term NGF treatment. Because the lysates from the differentiated cells showed a clear TrkPY490 signal (Fig. 4A, upper panel, lane 6), a fraction of internalized TrkA receptors remains persistently activated in the 7-day differentiated cells. Supplementing the differentiated PC12 cell cultures with an additional 50 ng/ml NGF for 5 min did not cause any discernable change in either the cell surface or total TrkPY490 levels (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Taken together, these data argue that ligand-induced receptor internalization in differentiated PC12 cells underlies the relative insensitivity of TrkA to varying NGF levels. Persistent Phosphatase Activity Restricts the Activity of Cell Surface TrkA in Differentiated PC12 Cells—Although the biotinylation experiments suggest that very few TrkA receptors reside along the cell surface in the differentiated PC12 cells, the attenuation of phospho-TrkA levels seen after treating the differentiated cells with 1:500 anti-NGF antibody argues that at least a population of the receptors must recycle to the cell surface within a 2-h period (see Fig. 3B). Treating differentiated PC12 cells with a cell-permeable tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (orthovanadate) for 2 h caused a dramatic increase in total TrkPY490 levels with only a slight increase in cell surface TrkPY490 (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with the vast majority of both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of the TrkA receptor residing in the intracellular pool. In keeping with this result, the addition of 50 ng/ml NGF caused no detectable change in total or cell surface TrkPY490 levels (Fig. 4B). However, a strong TrkPY490 signal was detected among the cell surface proteins upon shorter duration of orthovanadate treatment. At 30 min after the addition of orthovanadate to the 7-day NGF-differentiated PC12 cells, the biotinylated cell surface protein preparations showed an increase in TrkPY490 (Fig. 4C, lane 2, lower panel). This fell sharply thereafter with essentially no signal detected by 4 h after orthovanadate treatment. During this same interval, the levels of TrkPY490 in the whole cell lysates progressively increased from 30 min to 4 h with no change in total TrkA levels (Fig. 4C). This indicates that persistent tyrosine phosphatase activity in the differentiated PC12 cells maintains the cell surface TrkA receptors in an inactivated state. Incubating the differentiated cells with 1:500 anti-NGF antibody before a 30-min orthovanadate treatment attenuated the increase in cell surface TrkPY490 levels (Fig. 4C, lane 5). Thus, cell surface TrkA is rapidly activated by extracellular NGF when phosphatase activity is inhibited, and then the activated receptor is moved into intracellular pool and is inaccessible to extracellular ligand. Persistent TrkA Activation in the Differentiated PC12 Cells Regulates Erk1/2 and Akt Phosphorylation—In naive PC12 cells, NGF activates Erk1/2 and Akt through signal transduction cascades that are initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of TrkA (33Kaplan D.R.

https://openalex.org/W2052163927,"Little is known about the dynamics of the dendritic transport of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) to synapses. Here, using virally expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-GluR1 and GFP-GluR2 and confocal photobleach techniques we show near real-time movement of these subunits in living cultured hippocampal neurons. GFP-GluR1 fluorescence was widely distributed throughout the extranuclear compartment with no evidence for discrete intracellular stores. GFP-GluR1 transport was predominantly proximal to distal at rates of 0.2–0.4 μm·s–1. GFP-GluR2 fluorescence was more punctate and localized at or close to the plasma membrane. Overall, GFP-GluR2 movement was less dynamic with distinct mobile and immobile pools. Neither activation nor inhibition of surface-expressed N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors or AMPARs had any significant effect on the rates of GFP-GluR1 or GFP-GluR2 dendritic transport. These results demonstrate that GluR1 is constitutively and rapidly transported throughout the neuron. GluR2, on the other hand, is less mobile, with a majority retained in relatively immobile membrane-associated clusters, with ∼40% showing synaptic co-localization. Furthermore, the transport of both subunits is activity-independent, suggesting that the regulated delivery of AMPARs to the vicinity of synapses is not a mechanism that is involved in processes such as synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2060178418,"Experiments on cryptically chiral ethanes have indicated that the particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) catalyzes the hydroxylation of ethane with total retention of configuration at the carbon center attacked. This result would seem to rule out a radical mechanism for the hydroxylation chemistry, at least as mediated by this enzyme. The interpretation of subsequent experiments on n-propane, n-butane, and n-pentane has been complicated by hydroxylation at both the pro-R and pro-S secondary C–H bonds, where the hydroxylation takes place. It has been suggested that these results merely reflect presentation of both the pro-R and pro-S C–H bonds to the hot “oxygen atom” species generated at the active site, and that the oxo-transfer chemistry, in fact, proceeds concertedly with retention of configuration. In the present work, we have augmented these earlier studies with experiments on [2,2-2H2]butane and designed d,l form chiral dideuteriobutanes. Essentially equal amounts of (2R)-[3,3-2H2]butan-2-ol and (2R)-[2-2H1]butan-2-ol are produced upon hydroxylation of [2,2-2H2]butane. The chemistry is stereospecific with full retention of configuration at the secondary carbon oxidized. In the case of the various chiral deuterated butanes, the extent of configurational inversion has been shown to be negligible for all the chiral butanes examined. Thus, the hydroxylation of butane takes place with full retention of configuration in butane as well as in the case of ethane. These results are interpreted in terms of an oxo-transfer mechanism based on side-on singlet oxene insertion across the C–H bond similar to that previously noted for singlet carbene insertion (Kirmse, W., and Özkir, I. S. (1992) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 114, 7590-7591). Finally, we discuss how even the oxene insertion mechanism, with “spin crossover” in the transition state, could lead to small amounts of radical rearrangement products, if and when such products are observed.

In contrast to pMMO, the sMMO is a non-heme iron protein. Two major mechanisms have been proposed for the chemistry of methane hydroxylation mediated by these enzymes. One involves the radical mechanism, wherein an activated oxygen atom species abstracts a hydrogen atom from the substrate methane molecule, followed by radical rebound chemistry of the methyl radical with the hot hydroxyl radical to form the product (19Priestley N.D.

The other mechanism invokes anchoring of the methane molecule at an activated metal cluster and concerted oxenoid or oxene insertion across one of the C–H bonds via the formation of a four- or three-centered transition state (20Wilkinson B.

In principle, the two mechanisms could be distinguished from the stereochemistry of the products formed from the substrates at the carbon center hydroxylated. Only partial retention of configuration is expected in the case of the radical mechanism. When the hydroxylation chemistry mediated by sMMO from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (19Priestley N.D.

A large deuterium isotope effect has been observed between normal and deuterated methane, implicating extensive hydrogen tunneling during product formation from the transition state. However, these results are suspect since the large K m between normal and deuterated methane was not included in the analysis of the kinetic data (25Huang D.-S. Wu S.-H. Wang Y.-S. Yu S.S.-F. Chan S.I. Chem. Biol. Chem. 2002; 3: 760-765Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 26Baik M.-H. Newcomb M. Friesner R.A. Lippard S.J. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2385-2419Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The true deuterium isotope effect appears to be significantly smaller. In any case, similar experiments on cryptically chiral ethanes in the case of pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath) have showed that the insertion of the active oxygen atom species into the C–H bond during the hydroxylation occurs with 100% retention of configuration (20Wilkinson B. Zhu M. Priestley N.D. Nguyen H.-H.T. Morimoto H. Williams P.G. Chan S.I. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 921-922Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This result, together with the relatively normal kinetic isotope effect observed for hydroxylation of the C–H and C–D bonds, has provided strong argument in support of a concerted reaction pathway in the case of the membrane-bound form of the enzyme. A third mechanism, involving the formation of a carbocation intermediate, has also been invoked based on mechanistic probe studies on sMMO and cytochrome P450 (27Newcomb M. Shen R. Lu Y. Coon M.J. Hollenberg P.F. Kopp D.A. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 6879-6886Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In radical clock experiments, small amounts of rearrangement products derived from a putative carbocation precursor have been observed. Such experiments are not possible in the case of pMMO, where the active site is tucked within the end of a relatively deep hydrophobic pocket and is inaccessible to the bulky mechanistic probe. Direct proton-coupled electron transfer within the ground state seems relatively unlikely for a small alkane constrained in a hydrophobic environment. This electron transfer is expected to be extremely slow because the driving force is so much larger than the reorganization energy for the process in the case of methane and related alkanes. In any case, evidence for structural rearrangements of any carbocation intermediate should be reflected in the analysis of the stereochemical distribution of the reaction products. The pMMO exhibits limited substrate specificity (21Elliott S.J. Zhu M. Tso L. Nguyen H.-H.T. Yip J.H.-K. Chan S.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 9949-9955Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Only short-chain normal alkanes (<5 carbons) are hydroxylated and similar alkenes epoxidated. Hydroxylation of n-propane, n-butane, and n-pentane favors attack at the C2 carbon. In the case of 1-butene, epoxidation across the double bond occurs to a comparable extent as hydroxylation of the C2 carbon at the other end. This regioselectivity has been accounted for in terms of the details of the presentation of the C–H bond (or the C=C bond) to the metal cluster generating the hot oxygen atom species when the alkane (or alkene) substrate is maximally inserted into the hydrophobic pocket of the active site. Obviously, either end of the hydrocarbon chain could insert into the depth of the hydrophobic pocket of the active site with essentially equal probability. The stereoselectivity observed for the hydroxylation of n-butane and n-pentane are also unusual, with a preference toward the (2R)-alcohol, and an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 46(4.5)% and 80(2)%, respectively. However, in the case of 1-butene, the bias is toward the (S)-alcohol, with an ee value of -50(4)%. These results suggest different free energies associated with the presentation of the pro-R and pro-S C–H bonds to the active site; that is, there exists a rapid equilibrium of competing substrate-binding modes. More precisely, this equilibrium corresponds to different free energies associated with binding the substrate with different orientations at the active site of the activated enzyme. Within this context, either the rate of conformational adjustment of the hydrocarbon (including rotation about its long axes) in the hydrophobic pocket of the active site, or the on-off rate of the free substrate, or both, must be fast compared with the rate of the hydroxylation chemistry. In the present study, we have attempted to confirm these earlier findings with experiments on [2,2-2H2]butane and designed d,l form chiral dideuterated butanes. GC analysis of the stereochemical distribution of the corresponding (R)-2-acetoxy-2-phenylethanoate ester derivatives of the butanol products, together with GC-MS in conjunction with isotopic chiral labeling, have been used to follow the hydroxylation chemistry and to obtain independent and direct determinations of the extent of configurational inversion during the hydroxylation process. The results on [2,2-2H2]butane are remarkable in that essentially equal amounts of (2R)-[3,3-2H2]butan-2-ol and (2R)-[2-2H1]butan-2-ol are produced. The chemistry is stereospecific with full retention of configuration at the secondary carbon oxidized. In the case of the various chiral deuterated butanes, the distribution of products obtained mirrors the stereochemical configurations of the chiral butane substrates, after allowance is made for the expected deuterium isotope effect on the kinetics of the oxygen atom insertion step. The extent of inversion is shown to be negligible for all the chiral deuterated butanes examined. Thus, we conclude that the hydroxylation of butane proceeds with full retention of configuration in butane as well as in the case of ethane. These results are interpreted in terms of an oxo-transfer mechanism based on side-on singlet oxene insertion across the C–H bond similar to that previously noted for singlet carbene insertion (28Kirmse W. Özkir I.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7590-7591Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Growth of Methanotrophs (17Nguyen H.-H.T. Elliott S.J. Yip J.H.-K. Chan S.I. J. Biol.

Cultures were maintained in a closed anaerobic jar with an atmosphere of 20% methane in air and streaked onto fresh plates every 4–6 weeks. The organisms were first transferred from Petri plates to 250-ml flasks and subsequently to 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 30 and 300 ml, respectively, of the nitrate mineral salts medium with added CuSO4 (10 μm), 20% methane in air atmosphere, and continual shaking. The organism was grown for 48 h in these small scale cultures. The 300-ml cultures were used to seed a Bioflo 3000 fermentor (New Brunswick Inc.) with 5-liter fermentor vessel containing 3 liters of the above-described medium. After 24-h culturing, the optical density of the culture media was attended to 1.0-1.2 OD, based on the UV absorption at 595 nm, and the culturing volume was increased to 5 liters. A cell density up to 10 g/liter could be obtained under 1:4 methane/air ratio after several medium replenishments in which the CuSO4 concentration was increased every 24 h in 10-μm increments up to 40 μm. Methane feeding rate was controlled by the oxygen content in the culture media to around 2-5% of the dissolved oxygen at saturation. Preparation of [2-2H 1 ]Butan-2-ol—To a suspension of lithium aluminum deuteride (LiAlD4) (1.46 g, 34.7 mmol) in diethyl ether was slowly added butan-2-one (2.5 g, 34.7 mmol) in diethyl ether solution (5 ml) in an atmosphere of argon. The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 h at room temperature in a 250-ml round-bottomed flask. The resultant mixture was quenched by the addition of water (0.5 ml) and saturated sodium sulfate solution (3–5 ml) followed by diethyl ether (1 × 100 ml, 2 × 50 ml). After 10 min, a white precipitate was formed. The reaction mixture was then filtered through a pad of silica gel. The organic filtrate was washed with deionized water, brine, dried over by anhydrous MgSO4, and concentrated to obtain the desired product (1.95 g) in 75% yield. Preparation of [2-2H 1 ]Butan-2-ol p-Tosylate—To a solution of n-butyl lithium (16.3 ml, 1.6 m in hexane) in 50 ml of hexane was slowly added over a 20-min period [2-2H1]butan-2-ol (1.95 g, 26 mmol) in hexane solution in an ice bath under an atmosphere of argon. After stirring for an additional 15 min, p-tosylate chloride (4.95 g, 26 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture over a period of 10 min in an ice-water bath. The ice bath was then removed and a white slurry solution was formed within 5 min. The reaction mixture was stirred for another 1 h at room temperature. It was then quenched by deionized water followed by diethyl ether (3 × 50 ml). After washing the organic layer with brine and drying over anhydrous MgSO4, the worked-up solution was filtered through a pad of silica gel and concentrated to obtain a colorless oil. Separation of the resulting product by column chromatography gave the tosylated butanol (2.56 g) in 60% yield. Preparation of (2R*,3S*)-,(2R,3R)-, and (2S,3S)-2,3-Butandiol Di-ptosylate—All three stereoisomers of 2,3-butandiols were tosylated by following the procedure reported previously with slight modification (22Valentine A.M. Wilkinson B. Liu K.E. Komar-Panicucci S. Priestley N.D. Williams P.G. Morimoto H. Floss H.G. Lippard S.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 1818-1827Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Helmkamp G.K.

Typically, to a solution of p-tosylate chloride in dry pyridine was added the appropriate 2,3-butandiol. A precipitate of pyridine hydrochloride appeared after 5–10 min and the resulting suspension was stirred under argon for 5.0 h at room temperature. The reaction was then quenched and worked up. (2R,3R)-, (2S,3S)-, and (2R *,3S *)-2,3-butandiol di-p-tosylate butanes were obtained in yields of 78-85%. Preparation of the [2,2-2H 2 ]Butane and Relevant Chiral [2-2H 1 ,3-2H 1 ]Butane—10-15 ml of 1.0 m superdeuteride (Aldrich Inc., 15 mmol, LiEt3B2H) in THF was added to a 10-ml two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser. The solution was concentrated to ∼0.50–1.0 ml in vacuo to obtain a saturated superdeuteride solution. The appropriate mono-p-tosylate butanol and di-p-tosylate butandiol (2.5 mmol) in THF solution (100 μl) was added to the reaction mixture in a closed vacuum system at 65 °C. Vigorous gas evolution occurred for 15–20 s. The reaction mixtures were refluxed by equipping the flask with a -15 °C cooling circulating condenser and stirring for an additional 1.0 h at room temperature, and the deuterated butane gas was withdrawn from the headspace of the condenser into a 30-ml serum bottle in vacuo. In this manner, ∼77% pure dideuterated butanes, namely, (2R,3R)-, (2S,3S)-, and (2R *,3S *)-[2-2H1,3-2H1]butane, as determined by GC-MS (Finnigan G8000 series equipped with a VG Perform II and a capillary DB-1 column, 60.0 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness) were obtained from the relevant tosylated butanol. As expected, the contaminants were monodeuterated butane ((2S)- or (2R)[2-2H1]butane), ∼15%, and normal butane, ∼8%, derived from the residual hydrogen in the superdeuteride. In the case of the preparation of the [2,2-2H2]butane, the yield was only 70%, with the monodeuterated and nondeuterated butane contamination amounting to 24 and 6%, respectively. Hydroxylation of Deuterated Butanes Mediated by pMMO—To 4.0 ml of Pipes buffer (25 mm) containing 100 μm CuSO4 and 0.5 ml 3.0 mm sodium formate was added a 0.5 ml M. capsulatus (Bath) cell stock solution (grown under 30–40 μm CuSO4), and the mixture was incubated at 42 °C with a gas consisting of air and the deuterated butane at a composition of 50:50 volume ratio. After 2.0 h of incubation, the cell mixtures were withdrawn in 0.70-ml aliquots to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. To the reaction mixture in each of the Eppendorf tubes, 0.70 ml of methylene chloride was added and then spun down on a Sorval microcentrifuge at 8,000 rpm for 5 min. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered through a pad of silica gel. The filtrate was evaporated to 0.30–0.80 ml under a dinitrogen stream and characterized by gas chromatography (Agilent HP6890 Plus equipped with a HP-5 capillary column, 30.0 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm film thickness, coupled to a flame-ionization detector) to identify the butan-2-ol products in the cell reaction mixture and to ascertain their stereochemistry. Derivatization of the Deuterated Butan-2-ol—(R)-O-acetylmandelic acid ((R)-2-acetoxy-2-phenylethanoate) (Aldrich Inc., 47 mg, 0.24 mmol) and 4-(dimethylamino)-pyridine (DMAP) (Merck Inc., 2.0 mg) were mixed in 2.0 ml of methylene chloride at -40 °C in a 10-ml round-bottomed flask. Over the next 5-min period, a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) (Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., 54 mg, 0.26 mmol) in 0.50 ml of methylene chloride was added dropwise to the flask. A white precipitate resulted after 10 min. A 0.5-ml methylene chloride extract of the cell-mediated reaction mixture was then added dropwise over a second 5-min period and then stirred overnight at room temperature. The suspension was filtered through a pad of silica gel and washed with 5–10 ml of methylene chloride. The filtrate was evaporated to near dryness under a dinitrogen stream, and the residue was suspended in 0.5-1.0 ml of dichloromethane. Stereochemical Distribution of the Butan-2-ol Products—The enzymatic reaction butan-2-ol products were derivatized as esters of the (R)-O-acetylmandelic acid prior to GC analysis. Generally, a 1.0-μl aliquot of the (R)-O-acetylmandelic acid derivatives of the deuterated butanols was injected into the gas chromatograph, and the oven was kept isothermally at 140 °C. The retention times (DB-1 capillary column) of the two diastereomeric (S)- and (R)-butan-2-ol esters of (R)-O-acetylmandelic acid were, respectively, 35.4 and 35.9 min by comparing with the authentic standards (21Elliott S.J.

Soc., Perkin Trans. 1983; 2: 83-88Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The apparent diastereomeric excess (de) of the 2-butanol esters of (R)-O-acetylmandelic acid, or the enantiomeric excess (de or ee) of the 2-butanols, was defined as (R-S)/(R+S), where R and S denote the total amounts of each of the diastereomers as determined by GC peak integration. On face value, these data pertain to the stereochemical distribution of the overall chiral butanols produced from all the butanes in the original substrate sample; that is, the (S)- and (R)-butan-2-ols derived from the di-, mono-, and nondeuterated butanes. Product Identification—The various butan-2-ol esters of O-acetylmandelic acid were further analyzed for their deuterium content by GC-MS in the mass spectral region from m/z 56–60. Cleavage of the various butanol esters at the C–O ester bond leads to butyl cation fragments in this mass region. A control experiment on the nondeuterated ester of butan-2-ol revealed only the fragment ions arising from CH3CH2CH+CH3 (m/z 57) and its 13C isotopomers at m/z 58 and 59, aside from the parent ion at m/z 250. The relative abundances of the M+1 and M+2 ions relative to the C4H9+ mass peak at m/z 57 were measured to be 4.41% and 0.047%, in good agreement with the expected theoretical natural abundances of 4.40 and 0.10%, respectively. There were no mass ions contributing at m/z 56 or 60. Thus, there should be no other interference in the assay of the various deuterated butanol esters by GC-MS using this mass region other than the isotopomeric distribution of the deuterated butyl cations derived from the various butan-2-ol esters and their 13C counterparts. The various butan-2-ol esters were expected to yield the following butyl cation fragments: CH3CH2CH+CH3 (m/z 57), CH3CH(D)CH+CH3 and CH3CH2CD+CH3 (both m/z 58), and CH3CH(D)CD+CH3 and CH3CH+CD2CH3 (both m/z 59). Correction of the Apparent de for Contributions from the Monodeuterated and Nondeuterated Butanes in the Dideuterated Butane Samples—The diastereomeric excess (de) ratios measured from GC are apparent values, as they include contributions from products derived from hydroxylation of the monodeuterated and nondeuterated butanes in the dideuterated-butane samples. In order to correct for the contributions from the monodeuterated and nondeuterated butanes, we have derived equations to estimate the rates of production of the (R)- and (S)-butan-2-ol species from the di-, mono-, and nondeuterated butanes in the various deuterated butane samples (see Supplemental Materials). These equations are based on (a) Michaelis-Menten kinetics for the pMMO-mediated hydroxylation under substrate-limiting conditions, and assuming (b) the concerted oxo-transfer mechanism without configurational inversion at the secondary carbon(s), and (c) a rapid equilibri"

Photosystem (PS) 1The abbreviations used are: PS, photosystem; DCMU, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea; MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry. II is the pigment-protein complex, of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic thylakoid membranes, which is deputed to the splitting of water in oxygen and protons. Its functioning is understood in greater detail than its architecture, which is very highly structured in terms of protein number and interactions. Knowledge of the supramolecular organization of the system is rapidly increasing, parallel with the progressively better resolution obtained by crystallographic analysis (1Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1777) Google Scholar). However, the topology and accessory functions of low molecular mass subunits, about half of the almost 30 different polypeptides implicated in PSII structure, are far from being established. One of the reasons for this is the current limiting resolution of 3.8 Å of the crystal structure. Second, despite the strong homology in PSII among organisms that perform oxygenic photosynthesis, some small subunits such as PsbR, PsbTn, and PsbW are present in the eukaryotic complex, but missing in cyanobacteria. Other subunits are present and highly conserved in the PSII complex of all organisms performing oxygenic photosynthesis. This is true for PsbH, a component of PSII originally detected as a 9-kDa phosphoprotein in pea thylakoid membranes (2Bennet J. Nature. 1977; 269: 344-346Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation site(s) (3Vener A.V. Harms A. Sussman M.R. Vierstra R.D. J. Biol.

The function of PsbH in PSII has been associated, through analysis of a Synechocystis mutant lacking the coding gene, with control of the electron flow from QA to QB (4Mayes S.R. Dubbs J.M. Vass I.

The required presence of PsbH in the assembly and/or stability of PSII in the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii has been clearly demonstrated, also by the construction of deletion mutants (8Summer E.J.

Acta. 1992; 1098: 275-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). So, while PsbH in cyanobacteria appears to be partially dispensable and accessory, its fundamental role in eukaryotic PSII cannot definitely be investigated by reverse genetics in higher plants, since they are compulsory phototrophs. In a previous work (6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we showed that the maize PsbH subunit could functionally replace the endogenous one in the PSII of Synechocystis 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis). The heterologous protein brought about modifications of the QB site, which were hypothetically ascribed to its distinctive N-terminal extension. Here, we describe the analysis of four mutants of Synechocystis carrying artificial PsbH subunits, derived from different combinations of wild-type cyanobacterial and maize genes. For their construction, we took advantage of a PSI-less strain (12Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which is highly appropriate for the study of both PSII structure (13Szabò I. Seraglia R. Rigoni F. Traldi P.

We initially addressed the question of which domain of the PsbH polypeptide is important for the structure-function of the QB/herbicide-binding niche and the QA to QB electron transfer. The behavior of mutants with respect to the turnover of the D1 protein in response to treatments with high light was then compared and revealed significant differences. In particular, it showed that the correct structure of PsbH is fundamental in the final steps of the repair cycle of PSII, i.e. prompt removal of damaged D1 polypeptides and insertion of new ones into the thylakoid membrane.

Their parent plasmid, containing a 1319-bp fragment of the Synechocystis psbN-psbH-petC-petA cluster centered around the psbH gene, at the 5′ and 3′ of which HindIII and BamHI sites had been respectively introduced, was used for the construction of three other plasmids. (i) pCH269 was obtained by cutting the parent vector with HindIII and EcoRV, and legating the double-strand DNA formed by pairing of oligonucleotides syn13 (5′-AG CTT ATG GCT ACT CAG ACC GTT GAA GAC TCG AGC AGA CCT AAG CCT AAG CGC ACT CGG TTA GGA GAT-3′) and syn 14 (5′-ATC TCC TAA CCG AGT GCG CTT AGG CTT AGG TCT GCT CGA GTC TTC AAC GGT CTG AGT AGC CAT A-3′) into the obtained ends. (ii) pΔH228 was constructed by substituting the HindIII-(psbH)-BamHI fragment of the parent vector with a fragment obtained by PCR, using primers sr-delta (5′-AAG CTT ATG GCT AAA CGG ACT GGC GCA GG-3′) and cp2 (5′-TTG GAT CCA AAA ACT ATG AAG TC-3′) on template pMH264k (Chiaramonte et al., Ref. 6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), cut by the same enzymes, and (iii) pH-less, obtained by substituting the Hind-III-(psbH)-BamHI fragment of the parent plasmid with a cohesive-end adaptor duplex formed by annealing undecamers H3P1 (5′-AGCTTCTGCAG-3′) and P1B1 (5′-GATCCTGCAGA-3′). The kanamycin cassette derived from pUC4K (Amersham Biosciences) was cloned into the single BamHI sites of (i), (ii), and (iii), giving the final constructs pCH269k, pΔH228k, and pH-lessk, respectively. All constructs were completely sequenced to ensure that no undesirable mutation had occurred during the cloning procedure. The PSI-less Synechocystis strain was transformed by electroporation, as already described (Chiaramonte et al., Ref. 6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Recombinant colonies were subcloned 7–9 times in BG11 containing both 5 mm glucose and 100 μg ml–1 kanamycin. Genomic DNA from selected clones was extracted and analyzed by PCR with primers syn7 (5′-TTACCAAGGAGCTCTTTGGCC-3′) and syn8 (5′-CAAGGAGATCTTTACTGGCA-3′). Genomic DNA was otherwise subjected to Southern blotting after digestion with NcoI; Synechocystis or maize-specific psbH probes were synthesized by PCR with primers syn2 and syn4 (Chiaramonte et al., Ref. 6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or sr-delta and cp2 respectively. Labeling, hybridization and detection were performed using a chemiluminescent detection system (DIG DNA labeling and detection kit, Roche Applied Science). Preparation of Thylakoid Membranes and MALDI Mass Spectrometry—For SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, thylakoids were prepared from 5 ml of cell culture (∼2 μg of chlorophyll) following the procedure of Komenda and Barber (5Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Final pellets were resuspended in 50–100 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m sucrose and quantified by both chlorophyll and protein dosage. For MALDI mass spectrometry, thylakoids from 4 liters of cell culture (OD730 = 0.8) were prepared following the procedure described in Szabò et al. (13Szabò I. Seraglia R. Rigoni F. Traldi P. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13784-13790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). MALDI measurements were performed as described therein, on a REFLEX time-of-flight instrument (Bruker-Franzen Analytik) equipped with a SCOUT ion source operating in positive linear mode. Analysis of Chlorophyll, Protein, and Cell Concentrations—To measure chlorophyll, cells were sedimented by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 3 min and pigments were extracted with 100% methanol. Extracts were centrifuged, and the spectra of the clear supernatant were recorded from 300 to 750 nm. Chlorophyll concentrations were calculated from absorbance at 666 and 750 nm, according to Lichtenthaler (16Lichtenthaler H.K. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 350-382Crossref Scopus (9474) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations in thylakoid extracts were determined by the BCA (bicinchoninic acid) Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's standard procedure, with reading of the absorbance at 562 nm. Cell numbers were determined by flow cytometry using a Becton Dickinson FACScan instrument and CellQuest software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cell suspensions were analyzed at a flux of 12 μl/min, and cell counts were determined by the intrinsic chlorophyll fluorescence (λexc 488 nm, λem >670 nm). Oxygen Evolution Measurements—Cells collected from solid BG11 medium were suspended in liquid medium to a initial OD750 = 0.4–0.5. Cultures were grown for 2 days in liquid BG11 medium, supplemented with 10 mm glucose, 25 μg/ml kanamycin, 2.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol, at 5 μE m–2 s–1 light intensity and 30 °C. Before each measurement, cells were collected and resuspended in BG11 to a final concentration of 2 μg of chlorophyll/ml and then incubated at 30 °C in the same growth condition, up to the time of addition of the specific drug. Herbicides DCMU (3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea), atrazine, and ioxynil were tested over a range of concentrations suitable for calculation of the I50. Samples were preincubated with the specific drug for 15 min in the dark, in order to reach the specific binding site and equilibrate. Oxygen evolution was recorded on a Clark-type electrode (Hansatech CB1D) at a light intensity of 1000 μE m–2 s–1 and 30 °C, and the final value was calculated by subtraction of the oxygen consumption measured in the dark (prevalue). Fluorescence Measurements—Cells were cultured in the conditions described above and suspended at a concentration of 2 μg of chlorophyll/ml. Samples were dark-adapted for 5 min prior to measurements. Fluorescence induction kinetics were obtained using a pulse amplitude modulated fluorimeter (PAM 101, Walz). Actinic light of 3000 μE m–2 s–1 intensity and 1-s duration was applied. To determine fluorescence decay, single turnover flashes of 10000 μE m–2 s–1 intensity and 8-μs duration were applied every 18 s using a xenon lamp (XST 103). When specified, fluorescence decay was measured in the presence of 40 μm DCMU. Data were recorded and analyzed using the 4.5 Fluorescence Induction Program (QA Finland). SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Thylakoid proteins were resolved by denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 6 m urea and 0.1% SDS, according to Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207643) Google Scholar). 15, 7.5, or 1.5 μg of total thylakoid proteins (depending on strain, see “Results”) were loaded per lane, in gels used for staining or immunoblotting. For the latter procedure, proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using the carbonate/bicarbonate buffer of Dunn (18Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Blots were immunodecorated by polyclonal antibodies against the D1 polypeptide of Synechocystis, raised in rabbit by subcutaneous injection using poly(A)·poly(U) as adjuvant. Detection was made using the SuperSignal chemoluminescence kit (Pierce) for peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). When indicated, thylakoid membranes (6 μg of protein) and respective soluble fractions were incubated with 0.012 units of Lys-C for 15/60 min, in the presence of 25 mm Tris, pH 8.8. Reactions were directly stopped by addition of loading buffer for SDS-PAGE. Genomic and Expression Analysis of PSI-less/psbH Mutants—To generate the PSI-less/psbH mutants we took advantage of a PSI-less strain of Synechocystis 6803, which lacks the psaA and psaB genes and is tolerant to low light intensities, growing reasonably well in photoheterotrophic conditions at 5 μE m–2 s–1 (12Shen G. Boussiba S. Vermaas W. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1853-1863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This strain (a kind gift of Prof. W. Vermaas) was transformed in separate experiments with the five plasmids shown in Fig. 1. Each plasmid contains a wide segment of the Synechocystis psbN-psbH-petC-petA gene cluster (19Mayes S.R. Barber J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 17: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) centered around one out of five differently engineered psbH genes, followed by the same kanamycin resistance gene (Kmr). To avoid variability in the expression of the different PsbH proteins, all plasmids maintained the original upstream regulatory sequences of the psbH gene present in the bacterial chromosome (4Mayes S.R. Dubbs J.M. Vass I. Hideg E. Nagy L. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1454-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the same reason, the position and orientation of the Kmr cassette were the same with regard to the gene cluster. Following transformation, the obtained control strain PSI-less/SH233 and the double mutant strains PSI-less/H-less, PSI-less/MH264, PSI-less/CH269, PSI-less/ΔH228 2In a previous report (21Bergantino E. Brunetta A. Segalla A. Szabò I. Carbonera D. Bordignon E. Rigoni F. Giacometti G.M. Functional Plant Biol. 2002; 29: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) mutants were, respectively, indicated with the names 233k, H-k, 264k, 269k, and 228k. were examined for proper integration of the artificial genes and for achievement of homozygous clones (for the sake of simplicity, in the following text we omit the indication PSI-less in the name of mutants). Correct integration of the five psbH versions, together with the common kanamycin marker, in the gene cluster of the mutant strains was verified both by PCR (Fig. 2A), with primers bounding regions of recombination (Syn 7, Syn 8), and by Southern blotting (Fig. 2, B and C). Neither experiment could detect residual copies of the wild-type DNA in any of the clones. MALDI-MS was used to verify the correct expression of the mutated PsbH proteins and assembly in PSII complexes. This technique has recently been used to identify the main, as well as many of the minor, components of photosystem II in both thylakoid and PSII preparations from Synechocystis (13Szabò I. Seraglia R. Rigoni F. Traldi P. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13784-13790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Fig. 3, A and B show the representative MALDI spectra of PSII cores isolated from the original PSI-less strain, possessing the wild-type copy of PsbH, and from H-less cells respectively. A protein of 6982 Da mass is present in the former but lacking in the latter. Identification of this peak with PsbH is in accordance both with the predicted molecular mass of PsbH for cyanobacteria (6985 Da) and with our previous results (13Szabò I. Seraglia R. Rigoni F. Traldi P. Giacometti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13784-13790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The MALDI spectra of thylakoid membranes prepared from control SH233 (wild type) and CH269 cells are shown in Fig. 3, C and D. The former contains a 7088 Da protein; the latter exhibits a large peak at 8138 Da. The appearance of the 8138 Da peak is in agreement with the expected mass for the chimerical PsbH. The results, reported in Table I, indicate the substitution of the wild-type PsbH copy with the mutated one in the engineered strains.Table IMolecular mass of PsbH subunit in WT and mutated strains of Synechocystis 6803StrainExpected massMeasured massSH233 (WT)69856982aMeasured in purified PSII cores. 7094bMeasured in whole thylakoid membranes.ΔH22863296335bMeasured in whole thylakoid membranes.MH26476567692bMeasured in whole thylakoid membranes.CH26983128138bMeasured in whole thylakoid membranes.a Measured in purified PSII cores.b Measured in whole thylakoid membranes. Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Analysis—Electron transfer rates from the first stable acceptor, the plastoquinone QA firmly bound to the D2 subunit, to the second plastoquinone molecule, reversibly bound to the D1 subunit, is highly sensitive to the protein environment of the QB site. Perturbation of this site is reflected in a change of the QA → QB electron transfer. Thus, various herbicide-resistant mutants, in which the QB site is modified, are impaired in QA → QB electron transfer (22Erickson J.M. Pfister K. Rahire M. Togasaki R.K. Mets L. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 1989; 1: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Single turnover flash fluorescence decay kinetics are useful in providing information on how an electron generated by charge separation is equilibrated between QA and QB on the acceptor side of PSII. An initial fast decay phase (a few hundred microseconds) after flash excitation reflects reoxidation of QA- through electron transfer to the quinone bound at the QB site. An intermediate phase (millisecond range) derives from QA- reoxidation in centers with an empty QB site at the instant of the flash (kinetics of PQ binding from the PQ pool). Lastly, a slow phase (time range of seconds) reflects QA- reoxidation via recombination with the S states (mainly S2) of the manganese cluster of the oxygen-evolving complex. These complex kinetics have been described as the sum of two or three exponentials (23Crofts A.R. Wright C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 726: 149-185Crossref Scopus (575) Google Scholar) or, in some cases, by two exponentials plus one hyperbolic component (24Bennoun P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 59-66Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 25Vass I. Kirilovsky D. Etienne A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12786-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, in view of the complexity of the kinetic system and its intrinsic microheterogeneity, other decay components may also be present, and any description in terms of a discrete set of components may be arbitrary and approximate. For this reason, we prefer a description in terms of a rate distribution p(k), such that p(k)dk is the probability that QA- oxidation occurs with a rate coefficient between k and k + dk. 3In the continuous limit, rate distribution p(k) is defined by Equation 2, N(t)=QA-(t)QA-(0)=∫0∞p(k)e-ktdk(Eq. 2) where N(t) represents the fraction of centers with QA still reduced at time t. This may be obtained by fitting experimental time courses with the simple power law in Equation 1, N(t)=(1+k0t)-n(Eq. 1) and distribution p(k) can be obtained from fitting parameters k0 and n. 4Equation 1 has often been used in analysis of multi-exponentials (stretched exponentials) (26Austin R.H. Beeson K.W. Eisenstein L. Frauenfelder H. Gunsalus I.C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5355-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, 27Kleinfeld D. Okamura M.Y. Feher G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5780-5786Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In principle, rate distribution p(k) can be obtained by the inverse Laplace Transform of experimental data set N(t). However, we prefer to use a model function and fit the data in the time domain. Assuming a unimodal rate distribution, we can approximate it with a gamma distribution in Equation 3, p(k)=kn-1k0n-Γ(n)exp(-k/k0(Eq. 3) where Γ(n) is the gamma function. The advantage of this distribution is that it gives a simple description in the time domain, as its Laplace Transform is simply Equation 4. N(t)=l[p(k)]=(1+k0t)-n(Eq. 4) As shown in Fig. 4A, Equation 1 describes the experimental data quite accurately for all our mutants. The average value of rate constant <k> = nko and standard deviation σ2 = nk 02 of the distribution can be evaluated from fitting parameters ko and n (Table II). Fig. 4B shows the rate distribution function f(k) for the different mutants on a logarithmic scale. 5The relation between p(k) and f(k) plotted on a logarithmic scale is f(k)d log k = p(k) dk and hence f(k) = k p(k).Table IIAnalysis of fluorescence decay kinetics after single turnover flashStrain-DCMU+ DCMUnk0nk0ms-1s-1SH2330.6313.11.462.52ΔH2280.535.711.791.04MH2640.3410.51.451.40CH2690.2113.31.481.18H-less0.238.101.391.08 Open table in a new tab This type of analysis clearly shows how electron transfer rates in PSII are affected by modifications to the PsbH subunit. It may be observed that perturbation in electron transfer at the acceptor side gradually becomes more extended in the various mutant strains in the order ΔH228 < MH264 < CH269 < H-less. Besides a small decrease in the probability of reoxidation at the highest rate, the main effect is clearly that of increasing the probability of the lowest rate (recombination to the donor side). This corresponds to an increase in the fraction of centers that are not able to reduce QB. In a separate experiment, we measured QA- reoxidation in the presence of DCMU. In these conditions, the only pathway open to QA- reoxidation is recombination with the Mn cluster: QA- S2 → QA S1. Fig. 4C shows the results: it is evident from both time courses and rate distributions that all mutants are grouped, with little differences among them, around recombination rates lower than the control by a factor of ∼2. Oxygen Evolution Measurements—In a previous paper on the characterization of a Synechocystis mutant expressing the PsbH protein of maize in a PSI-containing strain, we showed that substitution of this subunit was accompanied by modifications in the sensitivity of the hybrid PSII toward herbicides, with particular regard to the cyanophenol ioxynil. We tentatively indicated the longer N terminus of the chimeric protein as the domain responsible for this effect (6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To check this hypothesis, all the new strains expressing a mutated PsbH in the PSI-less context were tested in oxygen evolution experiments with herbicides DCMU, atrazine, and ioxynil. Titration curves were drawn using increasing concentrations of each herbicide, and I50 values were calculated as the average I50 from repeated experiments (n = 3). As shown in Table III, all mutants exhibited higher sensitivity than the control strain toward the three herbicides used. However, comparisons with the parent PSI-less strain revealed that, although I50 values for DCMU and atrazine were only slightly reduced, sensitivity toward ioxynil increased more than ten times. In particular, the sensitivity of mutants ΔH228, MH264, and CH269 were, respectively, about 30, 12, and 18 times higher than that of the control strain. The almost 70-fold lower I50 value of the H-less mutant suggests that the absence of this subunit allows easier docking of ioxynil to its binding site on D1.Table IIIInhibition of oxygen evolution by herbicidesStrainI50DCMUAtrazineIoxynilμ mSH2330.12 ± 0.011.35 ± 0.1916.26 ± 1.68MH2640.08 ± 0.000.75 ± 0.151.35 ± 0.05CH2690.09 ± 0.010.74 ± 0.080.88 ± 0.37ΔH2280.07 ± 0.010.48 ± 0.120.55 ± 0.09H-less0.08 ± 0.020.63 ± 0.090.24 ± 0.05 Open table in a new tab At variance with a previous hypothesis (6Chiaramonte S. Giacometti G.M. Bergantino E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), these results indicate that the sensitivity of the MH264 mutant toward ioxynil is not due to the addition of an extra N-terminal extension but, rather, the whole protein is involved, and the entire subunit plays a role in setting up the correct structure of the QB/herbicide-binding site. D1 Turnover and Chlorophyll Photobleaching—It has been shown that, in a Synechocystis strain devoid of PsbH, photosystem II undergoes faster photoinactivation than in wild-type, but that D1 protein degrades at a lower rate. Moreover, in the same conditions, degradation of the D1 protein is significantly slowed down by the inhibitor of protein synthesis chloramphenicol (5Komenda J. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9625-9631Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To better understand this point, we examined the effects of photoinhibitory treatment on our mutants, in terms of D1 degradation in the absence and presence of lincomycin, which abolishes protein synthesis. Samples from different mutants were analyzed for the D1 content of the thylakoid membrane after exposure to photoinhibitory light of 1000 μE m–2 s–1. Cell cultures were light-treated in both the absence and presence of the antibiotic. Aliquots of each strain were taken at different times of light treatment and thylakoid membranes were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antis"

A StAR mutant protein lacking the first 62 amino acids (N-62 StAR protein) has been reported to be as effective as wild-type StAR protein. In the present study, we examined the mechanism by which StAR protein stimulates steroidogenesis. A Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins interacting with N-62 StAR protein. Nine positive clones were obtained from screening 1 × 106 clones. The results of pull-down assays and mammalian two-hybrid assays confirmed interaction between N-62 StAR protein and the clone 4 translated product. The clone 4 translated product was named StAR-binding protein (SBP). We prepared an expression plasmid (pSBP) by inserting SBP cDNA into the pTarget vector. After cotransfection with the human cytochrome P450scc system, StAR expression vector, and pSBP, the amount of pregnenolone produced by COS-1 cells was increased. The amount of steroid hormones produced by steroidogenic cells subjected to small interfering RNA treatment was less than that produced by control cells.

Increased progesterone synthesis prior to an increase in the level of StAR mRNA expression in response to cAMP induction has been revealed by analysis of hyperacetylation in the StAR gene promoter (20Christenson L.K. Stouffer R.L. Strauss III, J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27392-27399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although this increased steroidogenesis is thought to be the result of phosphorylation of the StAR protein by protein kinase A (8Arakane F. King S.R. Du Y. Kallen C.B. Walsh L.P. Watari H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32656-32662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), the mechanism is still not clear.Following synthesis, the 37-kDa StAR pre-protein is imported into mitochondria with subsequent cleavage of the mitochondria targeting sequence, yielding a 30-kDa mature StAR protein (21Stocco D.M.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 5165-5176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). StAR mutant protein lacking the first 62 amino acids (N-62 StAR protein), which contain the mitochondrial targeting sequence, has been reported to be as effective as wild-type StAR protein in stimulating steroidogenesis (23Arakane F. Sugawara T. Nishino H. Liu Z. Holt J.A. Pain D. Stocco D.M. Miller W.L. Strauss III, J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13731-13736Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). This led to the conclusion that the C terminus of StAR protein encodes its biological function for steroidogenesis and that the StAR protein acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane to stimulate cholesterol translocation. The proposed site of action of StAR protein on the cytoplasmic face of the outer mitochondrial membrane raised questions about the mechanisms by which StAR protein trades with mitochondria and expresses its action in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we used a yeast-two hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with StAR protein and modulate its steroidogenic action.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Constructs—A plasmid expressing a GAL4-N-62-StAR fusion lacking 62 amino acid-terminal residues was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment, prepared by PCR using human StAR cDNA as a template, into a pACT2 vector, which has a GAL4-activating domain (GAD) (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Plasmids expressing GAL4-StAR mutants (GAL4-R193X, GAL4-Q253X, and GAL4-frameshift) were also constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment prepared by PCR from cDNA of human StAR mutants, which were previously constructed (2Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). A plasmid expressing a GAD-N-62-StAR fusion was also constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment prepared by PCR and cloned into a pACT2 vector, which has a GAD (Clontech). Plasmid pVP16-StAR was constructed by inserting the EcoRI fragment from human N-62 StAR cDNA into the pVP16 vector, which has an activation domain (AD) derived from the VP16 protein of herpes simplex virus. The clone 4 translated product was named StAR-binding protein (SBP). We produced plasmid pM-SBP by inserting the EcoRI/BamHI fragment from SBP cDNA into the pM vector, which has a GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DNA-BD). Reverse combinations were also prepared; pVP16-SBP was constructed by inserting the EcoRI/BamHI fragment of SBP into the pVP16 vector. To produce plasmid pM-StAR, the EcoRI fragment from N-62 StAR was cloned into the pM vector. pG5luc (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) contains the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene or the luciferase gene as a reporter. From RACE results, we prepared an expression plasmid (pSBP) by inserting the EcoRI fragment of the entire coding region amplified by PCR from testis cDNA into the pTarget vector (Promega). A plasmid expressing an SBP-GFP fusion protein was constructed with the N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) (pSBP-GFP) by inserting an EcoRI fragment, prepared by PCR using SBP cDNA as a template, into pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). A StAR-RFP fusion protein was also constructed with the N terminus of red fluorescent protein (pStAR-REP) by inserting an EcoRI fragment prepared by PCR from the full-length cDNA of human StAR cDNA into pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech). The plasmids were prepared for transfection studies using a Qiagen Maxiprep system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).Cell Culture—Mouse Y-1 adrenal tumor cells, COS-1 cells, and human Hep G2 cells were obtained from RIKEN Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan). Human adrenocortical carcinoma H295R cells and mouse MA-10 Leydig cells were a gift from Dr. Mitsuhiro Okamoto, Osaka University Medical School (Osaka, Japan). Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). Human granulosa-like tumor KGN cells were a gift from Dr. Yoshihiro Nishi, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University (24Nishi Y. Yanase T. Mu Y.M. Oba K. Ichino I. Saito M. Nomura M. Mukasa C. Okabe T. Goto K. Takayanagi R. Kashimura Y. Haji M. Nawata H. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 437-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The Y-1 cells and COS-1 cells were grown in 35-mm plastic dishes. The Y-1 cells and COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. The KGN cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. H295R cells were grown in DMEM/F-12 containing 2% ULTROSER G (BioSepra, Cergy-Pontoise, France) and 1% ITS Premix (BD Biosciences).Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Screening—A human testis cDNA library (Clontech) in the activation domain vector pACT2 was amplified using the recommended protocol of the manufacturer (Clontech). To identify SBPs, the human testis cDNA library in pACT2 was introduced into the yeast reporter strain CG-1945 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4-542, gal80-538, cyhr2, LYS2::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -HIS3, URA3::GAL417-mers(×3)-CyC1TATA-lacZ) (MATCHMAKER Two-Hybrid System 2, Clontech) bearing a plasmid expressing GAL4-N-62-StAR fusion protein. 1 × 106 transformants were plated onto a selective synthetic medium (SD) lacking histidine, leucine, and tryptophan and grown for 5 days at 30 °C. An X-gal filter assay was used for determining β-galactosidase activity according to the recommended protocol of the manufacturer (Clontech). Plasmid DNA from all HIS+ and LacZ+ colonies was isolated after electroporation of total yeast DNA into Escherichia coli stain HB101 and selection in M9 media lacking leucine. After restriction analysis, cDNA inserts were sequenced using a GAL4 AD Sequencing Primer.Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—Yeast two-hybrid interaction assays were used to verify the interactions between StAR protein, StAR protein mutants, and the positive clones. Yeast strain Y187 (Clontech) with a genotype of MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, met -, gal80Δ, URA3::GAL1 UAS -GAL1 TATA -lacZ was used for the assays. The plasmid GAL4 and GAD fusion constructs were transformed into the Y187 strain using a YEASTMAKER Yeast Transformation System (Clontech). Transformants were plated onto a selective synthetic medium (SD) lacking leucine and tryptophan and grown for 5 days at 30 °C. An X-gal filter assay was used for determining β-galactosidase activity.Pull-down Experiment—A plasmid expression clone was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment prepared by PCR and cloned into a pCI vector (Promega). Translated protein was synthesized in vitro using a T7 RNA polymerase-based TnT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). A plasmid expressing a His-tagged CBD-N-62-StAR fusion protein lacking 62 amino acid-terminal residues was constructed by inserting an EcoRI fragment prepared by PCR using a human StAR cDNA as a template into a pET38b vector, which has a C-terminal His tag (Novagen, San Diego). CBD-N-62-StAR protein was expressed in bacteria according to the manual of the manufacturer and was used for pull-down assays. His-tagged N-62-StAR fusion protein bound to His-Bind Resin (Novagen) was incubated for 3 h with 50 μl in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled translated clone in a total volume of 250 μl of incubation buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Resin was collected by microcentrifugation and washed three times. Washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, heated for 5 min, and pelleted in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Mammalian Two-hybrid Assay—Culture cells at 40-60% confluence were transfected with plasmids with 0.1 μg of the pG5luc reporter plasmid, 0.5 μg of a pM-N-62-StAR protein (GAL4-StAR protein) expression plasmid, 0.5 μg of a pVP16-StAR-binding protein (VP16-SBP) expression plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pCH110 using FuGENE 6 (3 μl/μg DNA) (Roche Applied Science). The cells were cultured for 48 h after transfection and then harvested. Luciferase assays were performed using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega). The assay results were normalized to β-galactosidase activity to compensate for variation in transfection efficiency. Each experiment was repeated at least three times.Northern Blot Analysis—Northern blots each containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues were purchased from Clontech and probed with 2.3-kb of human clone 4 cDNA and β-actin cDNA according to the supplier's protocol. Northern blotting and hybridization using human clone 4 were carried out as described previously (25Sugawara T. Fujimoto Y. Ishibashi T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from Hep G2 cells, KGN cells, H295R cells, and MCF-7 cells. Complementary DNA synthesis was carried out at 37 °C for 60 min using 150 pmol of oligo(dT) as a primer, 1 μg of total RNA, and 200 units of SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H- (Invitrogen). Reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. Next, we designed the following oligonucleotide primers for amplification of the SBP: sense, 5′-ACTTGGAGGCTCAGGTGACCC-3′; antisense, 5′-TTCCTGGAGTGAGGCCACCT-3′. The PCR mixture (50-μl volume) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 10 pmol of each primer. The reaction was subjected to 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min.RACE Analysis of the 5′-Site of cDNA of SBP—Marathon-Ready cDNA, 5′-stretched human testis cDNA (Clontech), was amplified using primers. The sense primer was Adapter Primer 1 (AP1, 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC), and the antisense primer was 5′-CAAACTGGAAAGAGCCTCCTCGTGAG-3′, which was 198 bp downstream from the translation start site identified in clone 4. PCR was performed according to the supplier's protocol. The PCR products were electrophoresed, and DNA fragments were cut from the gels. The fragments were ligated to PCR 2.1 vectors using a manual protocol (Invitrogen). PCR products were sequenced, and the sequences were compared with the human genome sequence.Transfection and Pregnenolone Immunoassay—COS-1 cells were transfected with F2, a vector for the cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage system (called the F2 system) kindly provided by Dr. Walter L. Miller of the University of California, San Francisco (26Harikrishna J.A. Black S.M. Szklarz G.D. Miller W.L. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 371-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), pStAR (pSPORT StAR cDNA) (2Lin D. Sugawara T. Strauss III, J.F. Clark B.J. Stocco D.M. Saenger P. Rogol A. Miller W.L. Science. 1995; 267: 1828-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar), and pSBP using FuGENE 6. The cells were incubated for 48 h following transfection. Some dishes were treated with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol (1 μg/ml) during the final 24 h of culture. Forty eight hours after transfection, the medium was collected for radioimmunoassay of pregnenolone. The assay results were normalized by serum pregnenolone concentrations produced by cultures with 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol to compensate for variation in transfection efficiency. Each experiment included triplicate cultures for each treatment group and was repeated at least three times.Inhibition of SBP Expression by Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—Cultures of sub-confluent (40-50% confluent) H295R cells and KGN cells were plated so that 35-mm plastic dishes received equal numbers of cells. Endogenous SBP mRNA was targeted in cells with transfection by the addition of 19-nucleotide duplex (siRNA-SBP-I) and 21-nucleotide duplex (siRNA-SBP-II) (Dharmacon, Inc., Lafayette, CO). These duplex RNAs target 106 and 393 nucleotides downstream of the start codon of SBP, respectively. siRNA were constructed using the ribooligonucleotide pairs SBP-I and SBP-II with the following sequences: 5′-CGGGAUGUUUCCAGUGACAdTdT-3′ and 5′-UGUCACUGGAAACAUCCCGdTdT-3′ (SBP-I) and 5′-GAACUUGGAAGAGGGGAGGCAdTdT-3′, 5′-UGCCUCCCCUCUUCCAAGUUCdTdT-3′ (SBP-II). As a control for the specificity of these duplexes, we used a scramble ribooligonucleotide pair (siRNA-Scramble) with the following sequences: 5′-GCGCGCUUUGUAGGAUUCGdTdT-3′ and 5′-CGAAUCCUACAAAGCGCGCdTdT-3′. The oligonucleotides were annealed according to the Dharmacon protocol. Three hundred pmol of each duplex was introduced into cells using 15 μl of metafectene (Biontex Laboratories GmbH, Munich, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Dishes for H295R cells were treated with 20 μm trilostane (provided by Mochida Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) 6 h after transfection to inhibit the enzyme activity of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which transforms pregnenolone into progesterone (27Potts G.O. Creange J.E. Hardomg H.R. Schane H.P. Steroids. 1978; 32: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were collected for radioimmunoassay of steroid hormones. In some experiments, total RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR for SBP (27 cycles) and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (24 cycles) as a control was performed using the following primers for GAPDH: sense, 5′-TGCCGTCTAGAAAAACCTGC-3′; antisense, 5′-ACCCTGTTGCTGTAGCCAAA-3′.Fluorescence Microscopy—COS-1 cells were used for microscopic analysis. Cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Before transfection, cells were seeded on coverslips in culture dishes. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h. Transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. After washing twice in phosphate-buffered saline, each coverslip was mounted onto a glass microscope slide. Observations were made with a fluorescence microscope equipped with a mercury lamp with excitation wavelengths of 450-490 and 546 nm for GFP and DsRed, respectively (Axiophot, Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Emission was used with a 515-565-nm bandpass filter for GFP and a 590-nm longpass filter for DsRed RFP. A digital camera (DXM 1200, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) was attached to the microscope. The soft view system (ACT-1) provided by Nikon was used for image capture. Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe System Inc., San Jose, CA) was used for image processing.RESULTSYeast Two-hybrid Screening of Proteins Interacting with StAR Protein—A Gal4-based yeast two-hybrid system was used to identify proteins interacting with StAR protein. A plasmid expressing a GAL-StAR fusion protein, containing human N-62 StAR protein lacking 62 amino acid-terminal residues, was used to screen a human testis cDNA library in yeast strain CG-1945. Nine clones were obtained from screening 1 × 106 clones. DNA sequence and data base analysis revealed that these clones could be divided into three groups: α-helix coiled-coil rod homologue (HCR, GenBank™ accession number NM 019052), rabaptin-5 (RAB5EP, accession number NM 004703), and nucleobindin 2 (NUCB2, accession number NM 005013) (Table I). Both HCR and NUCB2 expressed the LacZ phenotype. From the expected intracellular localization of proteins encoded in the clones, we chose clone 4, which contained a 2.3-kb insert encoding a putative cytoplasmic protein, for analysis. Clone 4 contained an open reading frame of 1971 nucleotides encoding a 657-amino acid protein and a 62-nucleotide 3′-untranslated sequence that ended in a poly(A)+ tail preceded 21 nucleotides upstream by an AATAAA sequence. Other clones were not examined in this study.Table IHuman testis cDNA clones isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screening for StAR protein-interacting proteinCloneInsert sizeIdentityColony colorkb142.3HCRPositive52.2HCRPositive113.8RAB5EPNegative262.6NUCB2Positive360.8HCRNegative44454.3RAB5EPNegative492HCRPositive Open table in a new tab Interactions of StAR Protein and Clone 4 in the Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—To determine the interaction between clone 4 and StAR protein in vivo, a plasmid expressing a GAD-clone 4 fusion and a plasmid expressing GAL4-N-62-StAR and GAL4-StAR mutant fusions were examined. Transfections were also performed with the reverse combinations of clone 4 fused to GAL4 and N-62 StAR fused to GAD. The yeast transfected with StAR, and clone 4 hybrid vector expressed the LacZ phenotype, but the yeast transfected with a StAR mutant and clone 4 did not express the LacZ phenotype (Table II), confirming that N-62 StAR interacts with clone 4 in the yeast.Table IIAnalysis of interaction between clone 4 and a StAR protein mutant by a yeast two-hybrid systemDNA-BDADLacZ phenotypeGAL4GADWhiteGAL4-N-62-StARGAD-clone 4BlueGAL4-clone4GAD-N-62-StARWeak blueGAL4-R193XGAD-clone 4WhiteGAL4-Q258XGAD-clone 4WhiteGAL4-frameshiftGAD-clone 4White Open table in a new tab Direct Interaction between StAR Protein and Clone 4 in Vitro—Pull-down assays were performed to examine the direct interaction between clone 4 and StAR protein. In vitro translated clone 4 (50 μl) was mixed with CBD or CBD-N-62-StAR fusion protein (100 ng) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. These experiments revealed that the clone 4 translated protein interacted with CBD-N-62-StAR protein but not with CBD (Fig. 1). We therefore named the clone 4 protein (HCR) StAR-binding protein (SBP).Interaction between SBP and StAR Protein in Cells—To confirm further interaction between SBP and StAR protein, we used two-hybrid assays in Y-1 cells, COS-1 cells, and MA-10 cells. The empty vectors, GAL4 DNA-BD (pM) and AD (pVP16), did not activate the reporter genes. Cotransfection of GAL4 DNA-BD (pM) and AD-StAR (pVP16-StAR), pM and AD-SBP (pVP16-SBP), GAL4 DNA-BD-SBP (pM-SBP) and AD (pVP16), and GAL4 DNA-BD-StAR (pM-StAR) and AD (pVP16) did not increase reporter activity. However, the GAL4DNA-BD-StAR (pM-StAR) and AD-SBP (pVP16-SBP) fusion proteins induced 100-fold greater activation of the promoter compared with the activity observed when the pM and pVP16 vectors were cotransfected into Y-1 cells. The switched domain constructs, pM-SBP and pVP16-StAR, also activated the reporter in Y-1 cells (Fig. 2A). Cotransfection with pM-StAR and pVP16-SBP increased the promoter activity by 100-fold in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2B) and MA-10 cells (Fig. 2C). These findings reflect the interaction between SBP and StAR protein in vivo.Fig. 2Two-hybrid analysis of interaction between StAR protein and StAR-binding protein. Cells were transfected with the pG5luc reporter plasmid, pM-StAR GAL4-hybrid expression vector and pVP16-SBP VP16-hybrid expression vectors. Reverse combinations of StAR fused to VP16 AD (pVP16-StAR), SBP fused to GAL4 DB (pM-SBP), and pG5luc were transfected into cells. A, Y-1 mouse adrenal tumor cells; B, COS-1 monkey kidney carcinoma cells; C, MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)SBP mRNA Expression in Human Tissues—Northern blot analysis was performed to examine the expression of SBP. Northern blots that each contained 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated tissues were probed sequentially with SBP and β-actin cDNAs. Expression of the SBP gene was detected in all tissues examined. Its expression level was particularly high in the testis, where the sizes of transcripts were 2.4 and 3.8 kb (Fig. 3). To examine the expression of SBP in various cell lines, we performed RT-PCR using mRNA extracted from Hep G2 cells, KGN cells, H295R cells, and MCF-7 cells. The expected amplification products (400 bp) were obtained in all of the cell lines examined (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Expressions of SBP mRNA in various human tissues. Northern blots each containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from the indicated tissues were probed sequentially with SBP and β-actin cDNAs. The autoradiogram for the SBP probe was exposed for 48 h.

To quantitatively analyze EpoR contributions to co-signaling, phosphotyrosine (Tyr(P)) mutants were expressed as human epidermal growth factor (hEGF) receptor-mEpoR EE chimeras at matched and physiological levels in FDCW2 hematopoietic progenitor cells and were assayed for proliferative activities in the absence or presence of endogenous Kit stimulation. Two Tyr(P)-null (but Jak2-coupled) EpoR forms each retained ≤25% of the wild-type activity, whereas the add-back of single Tyr(P) sites in the EpoR forms EE-T-Y343 (Stat5 binding site), EE-Y479 (p85/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase binding site), or EE-Y464 (Src kinase binding site) significantly enhanced activities (to 100, 95, and 50% of EE-WT (wild type) levels, respectively). EE-Y343&Y401 and EEF343&F401 double add-back and deletion constructs were also prepared and were shown to possess 90 and ≤50% of wild-type activity. In contrast, efficient Kit co-signaling activity was retained only by EE-T-Y343 and EE-Y343&Y401 EpoR forms. EE-T-Y343 together with EE-T-Y343F and EE-WT EpoR forms were also analyzed in embryonic stem cell-derived erythroid G1E-2 cells with highly comparable outcomes, including the ability of EE-T-Y343 (but not EE-T-Y-343F) to synergize with Kit. Despite specific connection of EE-T-Y343 to Stat5, the contributions of Kit to EpoR-dependent proliferation did not involve Kit effects on Stat5 activation (but was limited by the mutation of Kit Tyr(P)-567 and Tyr(P)-569 Src kinase recruitment sites). Instead, co-signaling appears to depend upon the downstream integration of Kit signals with the targets of an EpoR/Jak2/Y343/Stat 5 response axis.

Erythropoiesis depends sharply upon combined sets of signals that are relayed by the single transmembrane receptors for erythropoietin (EpoR), 1The abbreviations used are: EpoR, erythropoetin receptor; Jak, Janus kinase; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2 protein; PSF, penicillin streptomycin and fungizone (amphotericin B); FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; MCSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SCF, stem cell factor; IL-3, interleukin-3; MSCV, murine stem cell virus; WT, wild type; ES, embryonic stem; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; CFUe, colony-forming unit erythroid; h, human; m, murine.1The abbreviations used are: EpoR, erythropoetin receptor; Jak, Janus kinase; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; CIS, cytokine-inducible SH2 protein; PSF, penicillin streptomycin and fungizone (amphotericin B); FBS, fetal bovine serum; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; MCSF, macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SCF, stem cell factor; IL-3, interleukin-3; MSCV, murine stem cell virus; WT, wild type; ES, embryonic stem; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; CFUe, colony-forming unit erythroid; h, human; m, murine. and stem cell factor (Kit).

Blood. 1998; 91: 3734-3745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) signaling. Nonetheless, EpoR forms that lack all cytoplasmic Tyr(P) sites for SH2 domain factor binding recently been shown in transgenic (30Miller C.P. Heilman D.W. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and EpoR knock-in mouse models (31Zang H. Sato K. Nakajima H. McKay C. Ney P.A. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3156-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) to support red cell development, but at somewhat less than wild-type efficiencies. For efficient EpoR signaling, the relative importance of positively acting Tyr(P) sites therefore remains a basic and somewhat controversial issue, and in vivo models may be complicated by compensatory erythropoietic mechanisms (32Li, K., Menon, M. P., Karur, V., Hegde, S., and Wojchowski, D. M. (2003) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar).In an aim to more quantitatively define the relative importance of select Tyr(P) sites in EpoR function, the following approach was presently applied. First, a series of EpoR Tyr(P) mutants were prepared as hEGFR-EpoR “EE” chimeras and were expressed using MSCV-based vectors in IL-3-dependent FDC cells (33Pircher T.J. Geiger J.N. Zhang D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 8995-9002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), as well as ES cell-derived erythroid G1E-2 cells (34Weiss M.J. Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). In cells expressing these Epo receptor forms at matched physiological levels (as isolated by FACS), the abilities of these Tyr(P) mutant EE receptors to support progenitor cell proliferation were then assayed in the absence or presence of endogenous Kit co-activation. This approach was prompted by signaling studies in several laboratories and systems that underline the importance of attention paid to EpoR expression levels (33Pircher T.J. Geiger J.N. Zhang D.

Neel B.G. D'Andrea A.D. Frank D.A. Blood. 2001; 97: 2230-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the present studies, activities of EpoR Tyr(P)-null forms were observed to be significantly enhanced by Tyr(P)-343, Tyr(P)-464, or Tyr(P)-479 sites for Stat5, p85/PI3 kinase, and Lyn (or Src) kinase, respectively. However, efficient co-signaling with Kit interestingly proved to be supported in each of two model systems only by EpoR forms containing a Tyr(P)-343 Stat5 binding site. Mechanistically this co-signaling did not involve detectable effects of Kit on Stat5 activity and instead is proposed to involve specific interactions between EpoR/Jak2/Stat5 target gene products and select Kit-directed routes. Findings are discussed in the contexts of core EpoR and Kit co-signaling axes and Epo- and SCF-dependent erythropoiesis.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Lines—FDCW2 cells (a myeloid murine marrow IL-3-dependent FDC subline) (33Pircher T.J.

Friedmann T. Driever W. Burrascano M. Yee J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8033-8037Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Cells at 30% confluency (100-mm dish) were transfected with 8 μg of pMSCVNeo or pMIEG3 EpoR (EE) or Kit (MK) constructs plus 8 μg of pVSVenv-G using 40 μl of FuGENE 6 liposomal reagent (Roche Applied Science). At 14 h after transfection, PSF was added. At 60 h, recombinant retroviruses (30 ml from triplicate transfections) were recovered at 4 °C, filtered (0.45 μm), and concentrated by centrifugation for 90 min at 50,000 × g. Viruses were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 0.1% Hanks' balanced salt solution, incubated for 4 h at 4 °C, and preserved at -80 °C.Transductions—Exponentially growing FDC cells or G1E-2 cells (4 × 105 cells/1 ml in 12-well plates) were combined with polybrene (8 μg/ml) plus 50 μl of concentrated recombinant retrovirus. At 24 h, transduced cells were cultured in complete growth medium (with 0.8 mg/ml G418 for MSCV-Neo transduced FDCW2 cells).FACS and Flow Cytometry—To match receptor expression levels among transduced cell lines, cells were gated and sorted by FACS (Coulter Elite ESP System). For EpoR EE chimeras, 2 × 106 cells were collected, washed, and resuspended in 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated at 4 °C with 5 μg of Fc fragment (Pierce)(15 min) with 2.5 μg of anti-human EGF receptor (Pharmingen) (45 min) and with 1 μg of phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, catalog number 115-116-072) (30 min). Cells were then washed, resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and sorted. Sorted cells were collected, washed in IMDM, and cultured initially in 2 ml of culture medium. For MK chimeras, sorting was based on green fluorescent protein fluorescence, and matched MK expression levels were confirmed using 1 μg of rat anti-human M-CSF receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number F181) and 1 μg of phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-rat IgG (PharMingen, catalog number 550767). Levels of receptor expression were determined using phosphatidylethanolamine microsphere fluorescence standards (30Miller C.P. Heilman D.W. Wojchowski D.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Cytokines and Proliferation Assays—Cytokines used were hEGF (R&D System, Minneapolis, MN), hMCSF (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ), murine SCF (PeproTech), and hEpo (Epoetin Alpha, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA). In proliferation assays, exponentially growing FDC and G1E-2 cells were collected, washed twice in 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and adjusted to 5 × 105/ml in culture medium lacking cytokines. To these cells (50 μl/well in 96-well plate), test cytokines (2× in culture medium) were then added. At 44 h of culture, [3H]thymidine (2.0 mCi/mmol, catalog number 2407005, ICN) was added (1 μCi in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% bovine serum albumin), and incorporation over a 2-h interval was assayed (1205 Betaplate counter, KBL Pharmacia).Stat5 Activation Assay—Exponentially growing FDC cells were washed twice with OptiMEM I medium and adjusted to 3 × 105/ml in OptiMEM I plus 8% FBS (2 ml/well, 6-well plates) in the presence of hEGF (10 ng/ml) and/or SCF (50 ng/ml). For analyses in G1E-2 cells, exponentially growing G1E-2 cells were washed twice with OptiMEM I medium and adjusted to 3 × 105/ml in IMDM, 13% FBS, 100 μm monothioglycerol in the presence of hEGF (10 ng/ml) and/or mCSF (100 ng/ml). At 2 h of culture, cells were transfected using 1.8 μg of pSPIGLE1-Luc (41Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol.

At 48 h, cells were washed, and extracts were prepared using reporter lysis buffer (Promega, catalog number E3971). Extracts were assayed for protein content (BCA system, Pierce) and for luciferase activity (luciferin substrate, Promega, catalog number E1483).RESULTSContributions of Epo Receptor Tyr(P)-343, Tyr(P)-464, and Tyr(P)-479 Sites to Progenitor Cell Proliferation—An initial goal of investigations was to quantitatively compare contributions of positively acting EpoR cytoplasmic Tyr(P) sites with hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation. A central focus was on EpoR Tyr(P)-343, Tyr(P)-464, and Tyr(P)-479 sites due to their respective coupling to Stat5, Src kinase, and p85/PI3K pathways. To allow for the reliable assay (and adjustment) of receptor expression levels (and to bypass endogenous EpoRs) a chimeric receptor approach was used in which the extracellular dimerization domain of the murine EpoR was replaced by that of the human EGF receptor (hEGFR) (42Pacifici R.E. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1571-1574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic Tyr(P) sites within resulting EE chimeras next were mutated to phenylalanine, recombinant MSCV retroviruses encoding these EpoR Tyr(P) mutants were prepared, and FDCW2 and ES cell-derived erythroid G1E-2 cells were transduced with these vectors. FACS then was used to retrieve transduced lines expressing EE Epo receptor forms at physiological levels (∼1000 receptors/cell), and their proliferative signaling capacities were assayed. Compared first in FDCW2 cells were the activities of wild-type (EE-WT), Tyr(P)-343-retaining (EE-T-Y343), and two Tyr(P)-null EpoR forms (EE-F8 and EE-T-Y343F). These EE receptor forms and their expression levels in transduced and FACS-analyzed FDCW2 cells are shown in Fig. 1. When activated by EGF, EE-WT and EE-T-Y343 each efficiently supported high level proliferation (Fig. 2). By direct comparison and for each of two Tyr(P)-null forms studied (EE-F8 and EE-T-Y343F), proliferative activities were uniformly lower (∼25% of EE-WT activity). This outcome is in keeping with the non-essential nature of EpoR Tyr(P) sites, yet also underlines apparent significant contributions of at least certain sites (including Tyr(P)-343) to efficient EpoR function.Fig. 2Tyr(P)-null EE receptor forms support progenitor cell proliferation, but at limited efficiencies. FDCW2-derived cell lines expressing the diagrammed EpoR forms (as EE chimeras) were cultured for 48 h in the presence of hEGF at increasing concentrations. Rates of hEGF-dependent proliferation were then determined based on [3H]dT incorporation.

For Tyr(P)-343-plus-Tyr(P)-401, this involved the construction of double add-back and EE-Y343F&Y401F double-deletion forms. These Tyr(P) mutant EpoR forms and their expression levels in transduced and FACS-selected FDC lines are shown in Fig. 3. In proliferative response assays, EE-Y343&Y401 as well as EE-Y479 proved to retain essentially wild-type activities (Fig. 4). By comparison, EpoR forms that either lacked Tyr-343 and Tyr-401 (EE-F343F401), or retained only Tyr-464, possessed limited activity (although each/all Tyr(P)-retaining EpoR forms were significantly more active than Tyr(P)-null EpoR forms). In these direct comparisons, EpoR Tyr(P)-479 p85/PI3K as well as Tyr(P)-343 Stat5 routes each therefore are shown to independently support EpoR proliferative activity at highly comparable (and near wild-type) efficiencies. In addition, positive roles exerted via Tyr(P)-343 plus Tyr(P)-401 in EE-Y343&Y401 appear to overcome of the effects of negatively acting SOCS3 and CIS factors.Fig. 3EpoR (EE) Tyr(P) add-back constructs, and their expression in FDCW2 cells.

Yu C. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1642-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), and opportunities therefore were provided to investigate Kit and EpoR co-function. Specifically, cells expressing the above EE EpoR forms at matched levels were exposed to hEGF at increasing concentrations in the presence or absence of a limiting dose of SCF (15 ng/ml, ∼15% maximal response to SCF only), and effects of EE and Kit co-stimulation on proliferation were determined. This first was studied for EE-WT, EE-T-Y343, EE-F8, and EE-TY343F EpoR forms (Fig. 5). For EE-T-Y343 (and EE-WT), co-function was obvious, and each supported Kit co-signaling (lower panels). Thus, Tyr(P)-343 alone (together with Jak2) can efficiently support this integrated aspect of EpoR biofunction. Whether Kit co-signaling might also be supported by other positively acting EpoR Tyr(P) sites next was investigated. In particular, EE-Y479, EE-Y464, EE-Y343&Y401, and EEF343F401 forms each were assayed for co-activity in the presence or absence of SCF as above. Among these EpoR forms, only the Tyr(P)-343-retaining construct EE-Y343Y401 retained the ability to efficiently integrate this Kit proliferative co-response (Fig. 6).

https://openalex.org/W2036184903,"Cell surface retention sequence binding protein-1 (CRSBP-1) is a cell surface binding protein for the cell surface retention sequence (CRS) motif of the v-sis gene product (platelet-derived growth factor-BB). It has been shown to be responsible for cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product in v-sis-transformed cells (fibroblasts) and has been hypothesized to play a role in autocrine growth and transformation of these cells. Here we demonstrate that the CRSBP-1 cDNA cloned from bovine liver libraries encodes a 322-residue type I membrane protein containing a 23-residue signal peptide, a 215-residue cell surface domain, a 21-residue transmembrane domain, and a 63-residue cytoplasmic domain. CRSBP-1 expressed in transfected cells is an ∼120-kDa disulfide-linked homodimeric glycoprotein and exhibits dual ligand (CRS-containing growth regulators (v-sis gene product and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, IGFBP-3) and hyaluronic acid) binding activity. CRSBP-1 overexpression (by stable transfection of cells with CRSBP-1 cDNA) enhances autocrine loop signaling, cell growth, and tumorigenicity (in mice) of v-sis-transformed cells. CRSBP-1 expression also enhances autocrine cell growth mediated by IGFBP-3 in human lung carcinoma cells (H1299 cells), which express very little, if any, endogenous CRSBP-1 and exhibits a mitogenic response to exogenous IGFBP-3, stably transfected with IGFBP-3 cDNA. However, CRSBP-1 overexpression does not affect growth of normal and transformed cells that do not produce these CRS-containing growth regulators. These results suggest that CRSBP-1 plays a role in autocrine regulation of cell growth mediated by growth regulators containing CRS.

Cell surface retention may allow the orchestrated release of growth factors/cytokines at the cell surface, permitting stimulation of spatial orientation, cell growth and differentiation, and organogenesis during embryonic development (10Carmeliet P.

The secreted proteins that undergo cell surface retention during secretion as demonstrated by pulse and chase experiments have been shown to possess cell surface retention sequence (CRS) motifs that are responsible for this phenomenon (1Lokeshwar V.B.

The CRS motifs have clustered basic amino acid residues that are well conserved during evolution from fly to mammal (17van Leeuwen F. Samos C.H. Nusse R. Nature. 1994; 368: 342-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), implying their biological importance. Interestingly, for some genes, the CRS motifs are exclusively located in certain exons. The alternative splicing of the CRS-encoding exons during transcription results in the production of various polypeptide isoforms that exhibit distinct but overlapping functions in vitro and in vivo (18Pollock R.A. Richardson W.D. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Feyzi E. Lustig F. Fager G. Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. J. Biol.

For example, vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) has six alternatively spliced isoforms in humans: VEGF121, VEGF145, VEGF165, VEGF183, VEGF189, and VEGF206. VEGF189 contains the CRS motif residues encoded by exons 6 and 7, whereas VEGF165 and VEGF121 lack exon 6a and exons 6/7, respectively (6Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 20Ferrara N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 21Park J.E.

Because of the lack of the CRS exons (exons 6 and 7), VEGF121 is secreted freely from cells. About 50% of VEGF165 (which lacks the major CRS motif) is retained on the cell surface. All of larger VEGF isoforms possess the CRS and are fully retained at the cell surface (6Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 20Ferrara N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 21Park J.E.

Transgenic mice lacking VEGF isoforms with a CRS exhibit impaired postnatal myocardial angiogenesis and ischemic cardiomyopathy that lead to cardiac failure and death (10Carmeliet P. Ng Y.S.

This transgenic animal experiment clearly indicates the biological importance and physiological relevance of cell surface retention of VEGF. The v-sis gene product, the oncogene product of SSV (24Devare S.G. Reddy E.P. Law J.D. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The cellular homolog of the v-sis gene product, namely the c-sis gene product (PDGF-BB) (26Doolittle R.F. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Devare S.G. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Antoniades H.N. Science. 1983; 221: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 27Waterfield M.D. Scrace G.T. Whittle N. Stroobant P. Johnsson A. Wasteson A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Huang J.S. Deuel T.F. Nature. 1983; 304: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar), was also shown to undergo cell surface retention (4Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The major CRS of the c-sis gene product is located at residues 214–227 (4Östman A. Andersson M. Betsholtz C. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 503-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Deletion of the major CRS of the c-sis gene product leads to enhanced secretion of the c-sis gene product but does not significantly affect the transforming activity of the c-sis gene product as demonstrated by transfection and in vitro foci assays (5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the major CRS is not required for autocrine transformation by the c-sis gene under these experimental conditions. However, it is still consistent with the hypothesis that cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product plays a role in autocrine growth regulation and the overall transformation process in SSV-transformed cells for several reasons. Deletion of the major CRS only partially abolishes cell surface retention of the c-sis gene product (PDGF-BB) (5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This appears to be analogous to VEGF165 that lacks the major CRS motif and exhibits partial cell surface retention (6Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 20Ferrara N. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1999; 237: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 21Park J.E.

VEGF and PDGF-BB have structural homology. PDGF-BB is a basic protein containing clustered lysine and arginine residues in addition to the major CRS (28Johnsson A. Heldin C.H. Wasteson A. Westermark B. Deuel T.F. Huang J.S. Seeburg P.H. Gray A. Ullrich A. Scrace G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). These clustered basic amino acid residues may contribute to partial cell surface retention properties of the c-sis gene product with deletion of the major CRS (5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Also, the overexpression (by transfection) system used by LaRochelle et al. (5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is likely to minimize the role of cell surface retention of the c-sis gene product in autocrine growth regulation and transformation of c-sis-transformed cells. The large amount of the c-sis gene product produced decreases the need for cell surface retention which facilitates the interaction of the c-sis gene product and the PDGF β-type receptor (5LaRochelle W.J. May-Siroff M. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1191-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). v-sis-transformed cells (fibroblasts) are a well accepted system for studying actions of the v-sis gene product and should also be appropriate for defining the function of cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product. For these reasons, the role of cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product in autocrine cell growth and transformation of SSV-transformed cells remains incompletely understood and warrants further investigation. The molecular mechanism(s) by which secreted proteins with CRS are transported to the cell surface and retained there is not understood. The extracellular matrix (ECM) or heparan sulfate proteoglycans are commonly thought to mediate cell surface retention of secreted proteins having CRS because they are capable of binding secreted proteins with CRS (18Pollock R.A. Richardson W.D. Growth Factors. 1992; 7: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Bradley R.S. Brown A.M.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and because their interactions with secreted proteins with CRS can be blocked by high salt and a polysulfonate compound (suramin) known for releasing the cell surface-retained secreted proteins from cells (1Lokeshwar V.B.

However, several lines of evidence suggest that a high affinity membrane-binding protein(s) rather than the ECM or proteoglycans mediate cell surface retention of secreted proteins with CRS. First, cellular proteoglycans are known to represent low affinity (K d = 0.6–4 μm) but high density binding sites for CRS-containing peptides (30Khachigian L.M. Owensby D.A. Chesterman C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1660-1666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Raines E.W. Ross R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 533-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Second, the Wnt-1 gene product, which possesses CRS, exhibits cell surface retention in both wild-type Chinese hamster ovary cells and mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells lacking expression of proteoglycans (15Schryver B. Hinck L. Papkoff J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). Third, cell surface retention of secreted proteins having CRS occurs immediately following synthesis, whereas the association of secreted proteins having CRS with cellular proteoglycans occurs in hours and days following secretion. The cell surface-retained secreted proteins either are released as degraded forms or diffuse slowly and then become associated with the ECM (1Lokeshwar V.B. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

Fourth, a 60–70-kDa membrane glycoprotein, namely cell surface retention sequence binding protein-1 (CRSBP-1), which exhibited high affinity (K d = 0.5–0.7 nm) binding of the CRS motifs of both the c-sis gene product (PDGF-BB) and VEGF, has been identified in and purified from cultured cells and tissue (25Boensch, C.

CRSBP-1 is expressed in all cell types and tissues examined including SSV (or v-sis)-transformed cells (fibroblasts) (12Boensch C. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol.

To test the notion that CRSBP-1 is responsible for cell surface retention of the v-sis gene product in SSV-transformed cells, we characterized the interaction of CRSBP-1 (endogenous) with the v-sis gene product in these transformed cells (12Boensch C.

CRSBP-1 appeared to form complexes with the v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor as demonstrated by metabolic labeling and co-immunoprecipitation. In these cells, the v-sis gene product, PDGF β-type receptor, and CRSBP-1 all underwent rapid intracellular turnover that was blocked in the presence of suramin known to reverse the transformed phenotype of v-sis-transformed cells (1Lokeshwar V.B.

This was not observed in normal cells and other transformed cells that expressed CRSBP-1 and PDGF β-type receptor but did not produce the v-sis gene product or PDGF-BB. In SSV-transformed cells, cell surface CRSBP-1 exhibited ligand-dependent internalization and recycling with a cycling time of ∼12 min, whereas it was very stable and did not undergo detectable internalization and recycling in cells that do not express the v-sis or c-sis gene product (12Boensch C.

These results suggest that, in SSV-transformed cells, CRSBP-1 forms ternary and binary complexes with newly synthesized v-sis gene product and PDGF β-type receptor at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and that the stable binary (CRSBP-1-v-sis gene product) complex is transported to the cell surface where it presents the v-sis gene product to unoccupied PDGF β-type receptors during internalization/recycling (12Boensch C.

These results also led us to hypothesize that CRSBP-1 plays a role in autocrine regulation of cell growth mediated by the v-sis gene product and other growth regulators with CRS. To test this hypothesis, we cloned the cDNA of CRSBP-1 from bovine liver libraries, expressed it in SSV-transformed cells and cells stably transfected with IGFBP-3, and characterized the biological properties of these cells. In this communication, we demonstrate that the cDNA of CRSBP-1 cloned from bovine liver libraries encodes a 322-amino acid residue type I membrane protein, which is synthesized as a 45-kDa protein post-translationally modified by glycosylation and other as-yet-unidentified processes to yield a 60-kDa glycoprotein that occurs as a disulfide-linked dimer in transfected cells. We also demonstrate that expressed CRSBP-1 possesses dual distinct ligand (CRS (sis)-peptide/IGFBP-3 (a CRS-containing growth regulator) and hyaluronic acid) binding activity and that CRSBP-1 overexpression enhances autocrine regulation of cell growth mediated by the v-sis gene product and IGFBP-3.

https://openalex.org/W2092036105,"Upon Ca2+ activation of cardiac muscle, several structural changes occur in the troponin subunits. These changes include the opening of the cardiac troponin C (cTnC) N-domain, the change of secondary structure of the inhibitory region of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), and the change in the separation between these two proteins in the cTnC-cTnI interface. We have used Förster resonance energy transfer in Ca2+ titration and stopped-flow experiments to delineate these transitions using a reconstituted cardiac troponin. Energy transfer results were quantified to yield time-dependent profiles of changes in intersite distances during Ca2+ dissociation. The closing of the cTnC N-domain induced by release of regulatory Ca2+ from cTnC occurs in one step (t 1/2 ∼ 5 ms), and this transition is not affected by Ca2+ release from the C-domain. The other two transitions triggered by Ca2+ dissociation are biphasic with the fast phase (t 1/2 ∼ 5 ms) correlated with Ca2+ release from the cTnC N-domain. These transitions are slower than the release of bound regulatory Ca2+ (t 1/2 3.6 ms) and are coupled to one another in a cooperative manner in restoring their conformations in the deactivated state. The kinetic results define the magnitudes of structural changes relevant in Ca2+ switching between activation and deactivation of cardiac muscle contraction. Upon Ca2+ activation of cardiac muscle, several structural changes occur in the troponin subunits.

The kinetic results define the magnitudes of structural changes relevant in Ca2+ switching between activation and deactivation of cardiac muscle contraction. Muscle activation involves Ca2+-dependent changes in the structures of several proteins and protein-protein interactions within the thin filament. These proteins include the subunits of the heterotrimeric troponin complex (Tn), 1The abbreviations used are: Tn, troponin; TnC, troponin C; TnI, troponin I; TnT, troponin T; cTnC, cardiac troponin C; cTnI, cardiac troponin I; cTnT, cardiac troponin T; cTnI-I, the inhibitory region of cTnI; cTnI-R, the regulatory region of cTnI; cTn, cardiac troponin; FRET, Förster resonance energy transfer; IAEDANS, 5-(iodoacetamidoethyl)aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid; Mops, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol. tropomyosin, and actin. TnC is the Ca2+-binding subunit, TnI is the inhibitory subunit that binds to actin and inhibits actomyosin ATPase and force generation in relaxed muscle, and TnT anchors the three-subunit complex to tropomyosin on the actin filament. The initial activation step is the binding of activator Ca2+ to the Ca2+-specific sites located in the N-terminal regulatory domain of TnC. This binding induces reorientations of the helices in the domain (1Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), resulting in an open tertiary structure (1Gagne S.M. Tsuda S. Li M.X. Smillie L.B. Sykes B.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 2She M. Xing J. Dong W.-J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and exposure of a hydrophobic patch. Two regions of TnI are involved in activation. The regulatory region moves into the open TnC N-domain and interacts with the exposed hydrophobic patch with a high affinity. This strong interaction is facilitated by the weakening/breaking of the linkage between the inhibitory region of TnI and actin, thus relieving the inhibitory effect conferred by TnI in the absence of bound activator Ca2+. Movements of the inhibitory and regulatory regions of TnI toward TnC allows a shift of the position of tropomyosin on the actin surface and exposure of actin sites for force-generating interaction with myosin. The Ca2+-linked molecular switch between relaxed and activated muscle is believed to be the inhibitory and regulatory regions of TnI. The switching mechanism is based on Ca2+-induced tertiary structure changes in the TnC N-domain coupled to secondary structure changes in the two TnI regions. In cardiac TnI (cTnI), the inhibitory region (cTnI-I) and the regulatory region (cTnI-R) span residues 130-149 and 150-165, respectively.

These studies have provided structural information on the thin filament proteins in the deactivated and activated states of the thin filament, in both skeletal and cardiac isoforms of the proteins, and insights on Ca2+-induced structural alterations that occur in the troponin complex upon activation. These insights are central to our understanding of the activation mechanism. Because activation and deactivation are time-dependent processes modulated by Ca2+ transients, temporal relationship in structural changes plays an important role in excitation-contraction coupling. Kinetic information on these changes is limited. Recent FRET studies of conformational transitions in cTnI reconstituted into complexes with the other troponin subunits indicated a large increase in the length of cTnI-I (12Dong W.-J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but no change in the length of cTnI-R (13Dong W.-J. Robinson J.M. Stagg S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8686-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-activated state, the spectral properties of the acceptor probe AEDANS attached to Cys160 (Cys160AEDANS) within cTnI-R and Cys167 at the C terminus of cTnI-R (Cys167AEDANS) indicated that Cys160 is buried and Cys167 is solvent exposed. In the deactivated Mg2+ state, the spectral properties of AEDANS attached to Cys160 are similar to the solvent-exposed Cys167AEDANS in the Ca2+-saturated state. These results are compatible with a model from NMR results (3Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) that, in the complex formed between the cTnI-R peptide and cTnC, the central region of the peptide binds to the hydrophobic patch of the N-domain of cTnC and the C terminus of the cTnI-R peptide extends beyond the patch. Taken together, the FRET data suggest that Ca2+ activation induces residues within cTnI-I to switch from a β-turn/coil to an extended quasi-α-helical conformation as the actin contacts are broken. It is this conformational transition that facilitates movement of cTnI-R into cTnC (13Dong W.-J. Robinson J.M. Stagg S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8686-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have investigated temporal relationships among Ca2+-dependent conformational transitions in cardiac troponin that are part of the Ca2+ switching mechanism between activation and deactivation. FRET sensing has advantages over single probe sensing because its inverse sixth power dependence of the distance between two sites is sensitive to small global conformational changes and the amplitude of the kinetic tracings is related to changes in inter-site separation. Time-dependent structural transitions resulting from a single molecular event such as ligand binding to or dissociation from a specific site can be studied in this way to establish the size of the transition (14Garland F. Gonsoulin F. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11621-112623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the first FRET-based kinetics of conformational transitions in cTn that are triggered by the dissociation of Ca2+ from its single regulatory site in cTnC. These results, which are expressed as time-dependent changes in intersite distances, provide a view of structural dynamics in cTn as related to Ca2+ dissociation transients and suggest that equilibrium studies need to be combined with kinetic studies to obtain a more complete understanding of the Ca2+ switching mechanism in thin filament activation and deactivation. Protein Preparations—Seven recombinant proteins of cardiac troponin subunits were used. They included wild-type cTnC, cTnC(20W/51C), cTnC(89C), cTnI(129W/152C), cTnI(150W), and tryptophanless cTnI and cTnT. cDNA clone for cTnC was from chicken slow skeletal muscle. A mouse cDNA clone and a rat cDNA clone were used to generate the cTnI and cTnT mutants. All mutants were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) and the expressed proteins were purified as previously described (12Dong W.-J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Labeling of single cysteines in cTnC and cTnI with IAEDANS and reconstitution of the binary cTnC-cTnI and the ternary cTn complexes followed our previous procedures (12Dong W.-J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The labeled proteins were found to contain >0.97 mol of probe/mol of protein. Briefly, troponin subunits were incubated in 6 m urea for 12 h at 4 °C at a ratio of [cTnI]:[cTnC] = 1:3 for the binary complex, and [cTnI]:[cTnT]:[cTnC] = 1:1.2:3 for cTn. The incubation mixture also contained 30 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm Ca2+. A stepwise exhaustive dialysis against a high salt solution was used to successively remove urea and renature the complexes (15Dong W.-J. Wang C.-K. Gordon A.M. Cheung H.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 850-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The final solution contained 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 m KCl. Prior to use, the complexes were passed through a Sephacryl-100 column to remove uncomplexed species. Fluorescence Measurements—Steady-state measurements were carried out on an ISS PCI photon-counting spectrofluorometer at 20 ± 0.1 °C (16Dong W.-J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FRET was used to monitor Ca2+ titration experiments. The reconstituted complex (5 μm) was in a buffer containing 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 m KCl. The fluorescence intensity of the donor (tryptophan) was recorded in the ISS instrument equipped with a Micro 4 pump (World Precision) for automated titration. Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 295 and 333 nm, respectively. In a typical titration experiment, up to 80 data points were acquired after successively injecting aliquots of 6.1 μl of a Ca2+-EGTA buffer. Free [Ca2+] was calculated by an in-house program, using stability constants given by Fabiato (17Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). The donor intensity (I D) of a donor-only protein (P-D) was first determined, followed by determination of the intensity (I DA) of the corresponding donor-acceptor protein (P-DA) at the same protein concentration. For each free [Ca2+], the FRET efficiency, E(i), was calculated from, E(i)=1-[FDA(i)/FD(i)](Eq. 1) and the corresponding FRET distance r(i) was calculated from, r(i)=Ro(i)[1/E(i)-1]1/6(Eq. 2) where R o(i) is the Förster distance for the ith data point and is given by, Ro(i)=Ro(0)[FD(i)/FD(0)]1/6(Eq. 3) R o(0) was determined from a sample containing no Ca2+ and FD(0) was the fluorescence of the sample without Ca2+ at the beginning of the titration experiment. Stopped-flow Measurements—Kinetic measurements were carried out at 20 °C in an Applied Photophysics SX 18 MV spectrometer with a 1.8-ms dead time. In Ca2+ dissociation experiments monitored by FRET, a protein sample saturated with Ca2+ in a buffer of 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0 containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m KCl, and 0.16 mm Ca2+ (pCa 3.8) was mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.15 m KCl, and 2 mm EGTA. After mixing, [protein] = 2.5 μm and [EGTA] = 1000 μm. As in equilibrium FRET experiments, the time-dependent change of donor tryptophan fluorescence intensity [I D(t)] was first determined from a P-D sample, followed by determination of the time-dependent intensity I DA(t) for the corresponding P-DA sample, using the same excitation and emission wavelengths as for equilibrium measurements. Ten to 20 kinetic tracings were collected for each set of P-D and P-DA samples, and the averages of each set of samples were used to calculate the time-dependent FRET efficiency, E(t), from which the time-dependent FRET distance, r(t), was calculated. The kinetic transients were fitted to a sum of exponentials to determine the rate constants. The residual plot and the χR2 ratio were used to judge the goodness of fit. Ca2+ dissociation was also determined using Quin-2 as the chelator. In this experiment, a cTn solution (15 μm) containing 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, plus 0.15 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm MgCl2, and 100 μm Ca2+ was mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer containing 500 μm Quin-2 and no Ca2+. Upon excitation at 353 nm, the Quin-2 fluorescence was isolated with a 380-nm cut-off filter. This transient provided a direct measure of the kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation from cTn. Ca 2+ -dependent Conformational Transitions in cTn—We previously reported two Ca2+-dependent transitions in cTn that were determined from equilibrium measurements. FRET-based kinetics and related equilibrium measurements of these transitions and those of a transition in the cTnC-cTnI interface are reported here for the binary complex cTnC-cTnI and ternary cTn. To facilitate presentation of the present results, Fig. 1 shows the proximity relationship between cTnC and cTnI. In the following sections, we present separately the results obtained from measurements of individual transitions. FRET-sensed Equilibrium Conformation of the cTnC N-domain—We used cTn reconstituted with the cTnC mutant 20W/51CAEDANS to determine changes in the inter-residue separation between Trp20 and Cys51 in a Ca2+ titration experiment. In this system, Trp20 was the FRET donor and AEDANS covalently attached to Cys51 (Cys51AEDANS) was the energy acceptor. This distance was previously shown to increase 6.3 Å upon Ca2+ activation (16Dong W.-J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the increased distance was taken as a measure of a Ca2+-induced opening of the cTnC N-domain. The three Ca2+ titration curves shown in Fig. 2A were constructed from the Trp20 fluorescence determined with two different cTn samples, one (P-D) reconstituted with a donor-only cTnC and the other (P-DA) with a donor-acceptor-labeled cTnC. The curve for P-DA shows a large increase in the donor fluorescence with increasing [Ca2+] (decreasing pCa). This increase reflected a large Ca2+-induced decrease in FRET between donor Trp20 and acceptor AEDANS, indicating an increase in intersite distance. This curve (Fig. 2, open circle) is biphasic with a major phase accounting for about 90% of the total change in donor intensity and a minor phase in the region of low [Ca2+] (above pCa 6). The origin of this minor phase was a small sensitivity of the fluorescence of Trp20 (in the absence of acceptor) to bound Ca2+. This sensitivity was demonstrated with the donor-alone P-D sample (Fig. 2A, open square). The curve for the P-DA sample contained a contribution from this Ca2+ effect not related to energy transfer. This effect was corrected, and the corrected Trp20 fluorescence data from P-DA were converted into a plot of FRET efficiency versus pCa (closed circle). This FRET curve is monophasic, showing a decrease in energy transfer with decreasing pCa and a pCa50 value of 5.81. The FRET data were converted to inter-site distances and replotted as a distance versus pCa curve (Fig. 2B). The pCa50 of the distance plot is 5.78, in good agreement with the value recovered from the FRET curve. This FRET-sensed Ca2+ titration curve shows an increase of 5.9 Å Ca in the intersite distance of cTnC upon activation (between pCa 7.5 and 4.2). Also shown in Fig. 2B is the distance curve for the binary complex formed between the donor-acceptor-labeled cTnC and cTnI. The pCa50 for the binary complex is 5.41, a shift of 0.37 pCa unit toward higher [Ca2+]. This shift does not affect the distances in the deactivated and activated state of cTn. The present results show that the extent of domain opening is a function of the degree of Ca2+ saturation at the single cTnC regulatory site. Kinetics of cTnC N-domain Conformational Change Sensed by FRET—The equilibrium FRET Ca2+ titration results provided a basis to use energy transfer to determine the kinetics of closing of the cTnC N-domain triggered by Ca2+ dissociation, with the same preparation of cTn used for equilibrium titration experiments. These experiments were performed by mixing a buffer containing EGTA with a sample of cTn at pCa 3.8. Under this condition, both the Ca2+-specific site and the two Ca2+/Mg2+ sites were saturated with Ca2+. Stopped-flow experiments were monitored with the fluorescence intensity of Trp20. Shown in Fig. 3A are kinetic tracings obtained from cTn containing donor-only cTnC (P-D, tracing 1) and donor-acceptor-labeled cTnC (P-DA, tracing 2). Both tracings show decreases of Trp20 fluorescence and both are monoexponential with observed rate constants of 84 s-1 and 113 s-1. Control experiments were done in which Ca2+-saturated cTn was mixed with a buffer containing no EGTA. These two tracings (not shown) were flat indicating no background contributions to tracings 1 and 2. The tryptophan signal from samples P-D and P-DA did not monitor the same kinetic events. Ca2+ titration experiments showed a 12% enhancement of the Trp20 fluorescence in P-D upon Ca2+ saturation at pCa 4.2 (Fig. 2A). This increase reflected a Ca2+ sensitivity of Trp20, not related to an opening of the N-domain. The observed rate of 84 s-1 from the P-D sample likely reflected this conformational change. Thus, the kinetic tracing for the P-DA sample contained contributions from the latter event and from FRET between the donor and acceptor. To separate these two events, the P-DA tracing was first corrected for the former contribution, then converted to a FRET tracing (Fig. 3B). The corresponding distance transient (tracing 4), also displayed in Fig. 3B, shows a decrease of 5.4 Å (domain closing) elicited by Ca2+ dissociation. The distance transient was constructed using R o = 22.0 Å for the initial Ca2+ saturated state of cTnC N-domain and R o = 21.4 Å for the Ca2+ depleted state. Both FRET and distance transients are monoexponential, with amplitudes in opposite directions, showing a time-dependent increase in energy transfer and a decrease in intersite distance. The rate constants for the two transients (126 and 128 s-1) are in excellent agreement with each other. To establish the temporal relationship between this observed domain closing elicited by removal of bound Ca2+ and Ca2+ dissociation itself, we measured directly the kinetics of Ca2+ dissociation from all three sites using Quin-2 as Ca2+ chelator (Fig. 3D). The increase in Quin-2 fluorescence monitored the dissociation as its fluorescence was enhanced upon chelating Ca2+ (18Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 252-261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tracing is biphasic with rate constants 199.3 s-1 for the fast component (1/3 of total amplitude) and 1.45 s-1 for the very slow component (2/3 of total amplitude). The relative amplitudes indicate that one of three bound Ca2+ dissociated with a fast rate and the other two bound Ca2+ dissociated with a very slow rate. We assign the fast rate to Ca2+ dissociation from the single regulatory site in the N-domain and the slow rate to Ca2+ dissociation from the two Ca2+/Mg2+ sites in the C-domain of cTnC. This assignment is supported by previous studies with both skeletal and cardiac troponin that Ca2+ dissociation from the regulatory sites was 2 orders of magnitude faster than the dissociation from the Ca2+/Mg2+ sites (18Rosenfeld S.S.

The closing of the regulatory N-domain of cTnC in cTn occurred with a rate that was a factor of 1.6 slower than dissociation of activator Ca2+ from the regulatory site. The kinetics of this transition in the N-domain of cTnC is also monoexponential for the binary complex cTnC-cTnI, but the rate is 236 s-1, almost a factor of 2 faster than in cTn.

We investigated the kinetics of this distance change in Ca2+ dissociation experiments using cTn reconstituted with a mutant cTnI(29W/152CAEDANS) in which Trp129 was the FRET donor and AEDANS linked to Cys152 was the acceptor. Kinetic tracings obtained upon mixing a EGTA buffer with the reconstituted cTn in which both the single regulatory site and the two high-affinity Ca2+/Mg2+ sites of cTnC were saturated with Ca2+ are biphasic (Fig. 4). The fast phase was 101 s-1 for P-D and 125 s-1 for P-DA (Fig. 4A), and the corresponding slow phases were 0.69 and 1.15 s-1, respectively. The tracing for P-DA was converted to a plot of FRET efficiency versus time (Fig. 4B) and a distance plot (Fig. 4C). The fast rates were 131.1 s-1 for the FRET tracing and 134.6 s-1"

Catalysis by TGT occurs through a double-displacement mechanism that involves the formation of a covalent enzyme-RNA intermediate (Kittendorf, J. D., Barcomb, L. M., Nonekowski, S. T., and Garcia, G. A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 14123-14133). The TGT chemical mechanism requires the protonation of the displaced guanine and the deprotonation of the incoming heterocyclic base. Based on its position in the active site, it is likely that aspartate 264 is involved in these proton transfer events. To investigate this possibility, site-directed mutagenesis was employed to convert aspartate 264 to alanine, asparagine, glutamate, glutamine, lysine, and histidine. Biochemical characterization of these TGT mutants revealed that only the conservative glutamate mutant retained catalytic activity, with K m values for both tRNA and guanine 3-fold greater than those for wild-type, whereas the k cat was depressed by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, of these six TGT mutants, only the TGT(D264E) was capable of forming a TGT·RNA covalent intermediate; however, unlike wild-type TGT, only hydroxylamine is capable of cleaving the TGT(D264E)·RNA covalent complex. In an effort to better understand the unique biochemical properties of the D264E TGT mutant, we solved the crystal structure of the Zymomonas mobilis TGT with the analogous mutation (D280E).

The x-ray crystal structure of the TGT from Zymomonas mobilis has been solved in the presence of the preQ1 substrate (13Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Inspection of this structure suggests the existence of a single binding site that can accommodate either the guanine or preQ1 base. Moreover, this structure allows for the identification of potential catalytically relevant active site residues. Studies in our laboratory and others have determined that aspartate 89 (corresponding to 102 in Z. mobilis; for clarity Escherichia coli numbering will be used throughout this paper) acts as a nucleophile in the TGT reaction, whereby its attack upon the 1′-ribosyl carbon leads to the displacement of the wobble position guanine via the formation of a TGT·RNA covalent intermediate (Fig. 2) (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15734-15739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Recently, studies of the TGT kinetic mechanism have demonstrated that the TGT reaction proceeds via ping-pong kinetics, whereby tRNA is the first substrate to bind to the enzyme (16Goodenough-Lashua D.M. Garcia G.A. Bioorg. Chem. 2003; 31: 331-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This result is strongly supportive of an associative mechanism for TGT catalysis. Examination of the TGT reaction products indicates that protonation of the displaced guanine and deprotonation of the incoming preQ1 must occur during catalysis. However, the mechanism of these proton transfer events remains unclear. Based on its position in the active site, it seems likely that aspartate 264 (strictly conserved in all known TGT sequences) may be involved in protonation of the displaced guanine and/or deprotonation of the incoming preQ1 during catalysis. To explore the significance of aspartate 264 in the TGT chemical mechanism, we have generated and characterized a series of mutant TGTs, each containing a different amino acid at position 264. The biochemical characterization of the mutant TGTs indicates that aspartate 264 is critical for TGT catalysis and is consistent with a role in both protonation of the displaced guanine and deprotonation of the incoming preQ1.

Enzyme (350-500 nm) was introduced into a reaction mixture (400 μl) of TGT assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT) containing 20 μm ECY tRNA and 20 μm [8-14C]guanine (56 mCi/mmol). Over 4 h, 6 × 60 μl aliquots were withdrawn at designated time points, quenched in 2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, the precipitate was collected on glass microfibre filters (Whatman GF/C), and the radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Enzyme activity was assessed from plots of guanine incorporation versus time using the Kaleidagraph software package (Synergy software). Assays were conducted in replicate. Covalent Complex Assay: Denaturing PAGE—The ability of the aspartate 264 TGT mutants to form a covalent complex with tRNA was assessed using a denaturing PAGE bandshift assay (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme (5 μm) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 10-fold molar excess of the mini-helical RNA substrate, dG34-ECYMH, in 10 μl of TGT assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT). Immediately following the 1-h incubation, the reactions were diluted 1:1 with SDS buffer (60 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and allowed to incubate at room temperature for an additional 1 h. Aliquots (4 μl) of each reaction were loaded onto an 8-25% polyacrylamide gradient gel and run under denaturing conditions following vendor's protocols (Amersham Biosciences). The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize the protein bands. Cleavage of the Covalent Complex by Exogenous Nucleophiles—The ability of guanine, preQ1, and hydroxylamine to effectively diminish the amount of TGT·RNA complex, as generated above, was investigated. Essentially, TGT (5 μm) was incubated in 40 μl of TGT assay buffer containing a 10-fold molar excess of the mini-helical RNA substrate, dG34-ECYMH, as described above. After 1 h, the reaction mixture was divided into four separate reactions (8 μl) and to each was added 2 μl of either ddH2O, 500 μm guanine, 500 μm preQ1 base, or 5 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.3). Incubation continued at 37 °C for 30 min, after which time each reaction was immediately diluted 1:1 with SDS buffer (60 mm Tris·HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and subjected to incubation at room temperature for an additional 1 h. As described above, denaturing PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining was used to visualize the TGT·RNA covalent complex. To better estimate differences in band intensities, the gels were scanned in 16-bit grayscale, and the band intensities were quantitated using the Molecular Analyst software package from Bio-Rad (see “Discussion”). Initial Velocity Kinetics: TGT(D264E)—Kinetic parameters for TGT(D264E) were determined for both the tRNA and guanine substrate via Michaelis-Menten analysis of initial velocity data that was obtained using the guanine exchange assay. For both tRNA and guanine, the concentration of the substrate of interest ranged from 0.1 to 20 μm in reaction mixtures consisting of either 750 or 400 μl of TGT assay buffer (100 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 20 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT) and 141 nm TGT(D264E). The concentration of the second substrate remained saturating at 20 μm. Aliquots (125 or 70 μl) were withdrawn at designated time points over the course of 1 h. The aliquots were quenched in either 4 or 2 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, the precipitate was collected on glass microfibre filters (Whatman GF/C), and the radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Initial velocities (v i values) for each substrate concentration were obtained from linear regression of guanine incorporation versus time and converted to reciprocal seconds by dividing by the enzyme concentration (141 nm) and aliquot size (125 or 70 μl). K m and k cat values for each substrate were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of plots of initial velocities (reciprocal seconds) versus substrate concentration using the Kaleidagraph software package (Synergy software). X-ray Crystallography and Structure Determination of Z. mobilis TGT(D280E)—Attempts to determine the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli TGT have been unsuccessful. However, the highly homologous (55% sequence identity) TGT from Z. mobilis has been amenable to crystallization and x-ray structure determination (13Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have generated the mutation (D280E) in the Z. mobilis TGT that corresponds to D264E in the E. coli TGT following the method of Grädler et al. (22Grädler U. Ficner R. Garcia G.A. Stubbs M.T. Klebe G. Reuter K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Z. mobilis TGT(D280E) was purified and crystallized as described previously (13Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2850-2857Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Crystals were soaked overnight with preQ1 at 22 °C in a buffer composed of 5% (w/v) PEG 8000, 10% (v/v) Me2SO, 100 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mm DTT, and 50 mm preQ1. X-ray data were collected on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator (Rigaku/MSC) operating at 50 kV and 100 mA and equipped with focusing mirrors (MSC/Yale) and an R-AXIS IV image plate detector. Crystals were flash-cooled in nylon-fiber loops in a 100 K nitrogen gas stream provided by an X-stream cryo system. As a cryo buffer, a solution consisting of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 16% (w/v) PEG 8000, and 30% (v/v) glycerol was used. Diffraction data were indexed and processed using the programs DENZO and XDISP (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The pre-processed data were then scaled and merged using SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). The structures were refined through several cycles of least-squares refinement along with an energy minimization using CNS and Shelxl (24Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P.

Open table in a new tab Activity Screen—In the absence of preQ1, TGT will catalyze the exchange of guanine34 of substrate tRNA with free guanine. This feature is taken advantage of in the guanine exchange assay, which monitors the TGT reaction progress by following the incorporation of radiolabeled guanine into the tRNA substrate. Each aspartate 264 mutant TGT was screened for the ability to catalyze the incorporation of [8-14C]guanine into substrate tRNA. Under conditions of relatively high enzyme concentration (350-500 nm), normally saturating substrate concentrations (20 μm tRNA and 20 μm guanine), and extensive time courses (4 h), only TGT(D264E) exhibited guanine exchange activity (∼10-4 s-1). Although significant, this activity represents only 12% of the specific activity (as reflected by k cat, Table II) observed for TGT(wt) (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, the other five aspartate 264 mutant TGTs also displayed low levels of guanine exchange activity; however, in each case, the observed activity was ∼3 orders of magnitude lower than that of TGT(wt). Activity of this magnitude has been previously observed in our laboratory for mutants of the TGT nucleophile, aspartate 89, and was attributed to the presence of wild-type TGT contamination that is carried over from the bacterial host strain (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A.

Open table in a new tab Covalent Complex Formation—The presence of a “stable” (covalent) TGT·RNA complex has been observed under mildly denaturing conditions (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Romier C. Reuter K. Suck D. Ficner R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15734-15739Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, during the investigation of the TGT recognition of tRNA, a correlation between the formation of this covalent complex and enzymatic activity was identified (21Kung F.L. Nonekowski S. Garcia G.A. RNA (N. Y.). 2000; 6: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The ability of the aspartate 264 mutants to form a TGT·RNA covalent complex was assessed using the mini-helical RNA analogue, dG34-ECYMH. This analogue is a truncated form of the E. coli tyrosyl-tRNA (ECY) consisting of the anticodon stem and loop, with a 2′-deoxyguanosine substituting for the guanosine found at the wobble position (i.e. position of TGT catalysis). Importantly, dG34-ECYMH has been shown to be a substrate for TGT and is used in this assay, because it exhibits a higher extent of covalent complex formation under experimental conditions (19Nonekowski S.T. Kung F.L. Garcia G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7178-7182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the absence of tRNA, histidine-tagged TGT(wt) migrates to a molecular mass of 44 kDa (42 kDa for TGT plus 2 kDa for the histidine tag) under denaturing conditions. As seen in Fig. 3 (odd lanes), in the absence of tRNA, each of the TGT mutants exhibits migratory patterns similar to that observed with TGT(wt). However, in the presence of the mini-helical RNA, dG34-ECYMH (even lanes), only TGT(wt) and TGT(D264E) demonstrate the ability to form a TGT·RNA complex, as evidenced by the appearance of a second band around 50 kDa. This result is consistent with the fact that TGT(D264E) was the only TGT mutant in the series to exhibit guanine exchange activity. Interestingly, based on visual inspection of the band intensities, TGT(D264E) appears to form a greater amount of covalent complex with dG34-ECYMH when compared with TGT(wt) under the same conditions. Cleavage of Covalent Complex—The reactivity of the TGT·RNA covalent complex with exogenous guanine, preQ1, and hydroxylamine was examined. In these experiments, the addition of excess guanine or preQ1 to the TGT·RNA reaction mixtures essentially mimics catalytic conditions and would therefore be expected to reduce the amount of TGT·RNA covalent complex via TGT turnover. In contrast, hydroxylamine is not a normal substrate for TGT; however, given its intrinsic nucleophilicity, it was expected that hydroxylamine could cleave the TGT·RNA covalent complex. In the complex formed between TGT(wt) and dG34-ECYMH, the addition of excess guanine diminishes the amount of covalent complex (from ∼60% to 35%), whereas the addition of excess preQ1 completely cleaves it (Fig. 4B). The fact that guanine does not completely eliminate the complex is likely due to the fact that the guanine exchange reaction catalyzed by TGT is reversible, and therefore, equilibrium is achieved. Not surprisingly, as was seen with preQ1, the addition of excess hydroxylamine also completely cleaves the covalent complex that is formed between TGT(wt) and RNA. Similar results were obtained for the covalent complex formed from TGT(D89E), the glutamate mutation of the nucleophilic aspartate (Fig. 4B) (14Kittendorf J.D. Barcomb L.M. Nonekowski S.T. Garcia G.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14123-14133Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of excess guanine reduces the amou"

Here we study the effects of base modifications on the rate and extent of single-turnover DNA transesterification. Chiral trans opened C-10 R and S adducts of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide were introduced at single N 6-deoxyadenosine (dA) positions within the 3′-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1T-1A-2 sequence of the nonscissile DNA strand. The R and S BPdA adducts intercalate from the major groove on the 5′ and 3′ sides of the modified base, respectively, and perturb local base stacking. We found that R and S BPdA modifications at +1A reduced the transesterification rate by a factor of 700–1000 without affecting the yield of the covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex. BPdA modifications at +2A reduced the extent of transesterification and elicited rate decrements of 200- and 7000-fold for the S and R diastereomers, respectively. In contrast, BPdA adducts at the -2 position had no effect on the extent of the reaction and relatively little impact on the rate of cleavage. A more subtle probe of major groove contacts entailed substituting each of the purines of the nonscissile strand with its 8-oxo analog. The +3 oxoG modification slowed transesterification 35-fold, whereas other 8-oxo modifications were benign. 8-Oxo substitutions at the -1 position in the scissile strand slowed single-turnover cleavage by a factor of six but had an even greater slowing effect on religation, which resulted in an increase in the cleavage equilibrium constant. 2-Aminopurine at positions +3, +4, or +5 in the nonscissile strand had no effect on transesterification per se but had synergistic effects when combined with 8-oxoA at position -1 in the scissile strand.

Our expectation is that fuller knowledge of the other functionally relevant DNA contacts (i.e. other than to the scissile phosphate) will facilitate the design of small molecule inhibitors that either block transesterification or trap the poxvirus topoisomerase in a catalytically inactive conformation. Interference by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts allowed us to map the minor groove interface between vaccinia topoisomerase and its cleavage site (28Tian L. Sayer J.M. Kroth H. Kalena G.

This approach entailed the introduction of 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide adducts of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) 1The abbreviations used are: BP, benzo[a]pyrene; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; AP, 2-aminopurine deoxyriboside. at the exocyclic N 2-amino group of single deoxyguanosine (dG) positions within the nonscissile 3′-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1N-1N-2 strand of a suicide cleavage substrate for vaccinia topoisomerase. The trans opened BPdG adducts fit into the minor groove without perturbing helix conformation or base pairing, and the C-10 R and S diastereomers are oriented in opposite directions within the minor groove (29Cosman M. de los Santos C.

We observed a sharp margin of interference effects, whereby +5 and -2 BPdG modifications were well tolerated but +4, +3, and -1 BPdG adducts were severely deleterious. The stereoselective effects at the -1 nucleoside (the R diastereomer interfered, whereas the S diastereomer did not) delineated at high resolution the downstream border of the minor groove interface. It was inferred that BPdG inhibition of transesterification is likely caused by steric exclusion of essential constituents of the topoisomerase from the DNA minor groove. These results highlight the merits of testing minor groove sequence-reading polyamides (31White S. Szewcyzk J.W. Turner J.M. Baird E.E. Dervan P.B.

Here we extend the use of defined polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon DNA adducts to probe the effects of position-specific intercalation via the major groove. We introduce 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxide adducts of BP at the exocyclic N 6-amino group of single deoxyadenosine (dA) positions within the nonscissile strand. These BPdA adducts, shown in Fig. 1A, are derived from trans opening with inversion at C-10 of the (-)-(7S,8R,9R,10S) and (+)-(7R,8S,9S,10R) enantiomers of the 7,8-diol 9,10-epoxides in which the benzylic 7-hydroxyl group and the epoxide oxygen are trans. Two-dimensional NMR structures of duplex DNAs containing single BPdA adducts have established that the aromatic ring systems intercalate via the major groove on opposite sides of the modified dA* base depending on their configuration at C-10 (32Volk D.E.

The pyrenyl moiety of the C-10 R diastereomer intercalates on the 5′ side of the dA*, whereas the S diastereomer intercalates on the 3′ side (e.g. as depicted schematically in Fig. 1B). BPdA-modified DNAs retain B-form helix conformation along the duplex except at the lesion site, where base stacking is perturbed by the intercalated aromatic ring system. The intercalated hydrocarbon wedges apart the two flanking bases of the complementary strand and causes a buckling of the modified base pair and the base pair flanking the hydrocarbon. Fortuitously, an NMR structure of the R diastereomer of BPdA-modified duplex DNA has been determined (32Volk D.E. Rice J.S. Luxon B.A. Yeh H.J.C. Liang C. Xie G. Sayer J.M. Jerina D.M.

We report here that R and S BPdA modifications at the +1A and +2A positions drastically reduced the transesterification rate (by factors of 200–7000), whereas BPdA adducts at the -2 position had little impact on the rate of cleavage. We also use more subtle base modifications (8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoadenine, and 2-aminopurine) to delineate the functional DNA interface of vaccinia topoisomerase with the major groove. Notable findings are that the +3 oxoguanine modification of the nonscissile strand significantly slows the cleavage rate, with no effect on religation, implying that contacts with or near +3G in the major groove are important for triggering assembly of the active site. 8-Oxo substitutions immediately 3′ of the cleavage site on the scissile strand act as mild topoisomerase poisons, i.e. they slow the rate of cleavage modestly but have a greater retarding effect on the rate of religation, which increases the cleavage equilibrium constant. Modified DNA Oligonucleotides—Oligonucleotide 18-mers containing trans opened C-10 S and R BPdA adducts (Fig. 1) were synthesized and purified as described (37Pommier Y. Laco S. Kohlhagen G.

The S and R BPdA-adducted oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC. For chromatographic conditions and retention times see Supplemental Table S1. For oligonucleotides that were synthesized as the S/R diastereomeric pairs, absolute configurations were assigned to the separated oligonucleotides on the basis of their long wavelength (330–360 nm) circular dichroism spectra, which exhibited negative bands for the C-10 S diastereomers and positive bands for the C-10 R diastereomers (52Christner D.F.

Oligonucleotides containing 7,8-dihydro-8-oxodeoxyguanosine (oxoG) were prepared by automated synthesis using oxoG phosphoramidite purchased from Glen Research (Sterling, VA). Following the supplier's instructions, 0.25 m 2-mecaptoethanol was added to the ammonia solution used to cleave the oligonucleotide from the support and remove base-labile protecting groups. Mercaptoethanol was removed by gel filtration through a NAP-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 0.1 m ammonium acetate. The 5′-DMT-protected oxoG oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC followed by acid cleavage of the DMT-protecting groups. The deprotected oxoG oligonucleotides were then repurified by HPLC (see Table S2 for chromatographic conditions and retention times). Selected oxoG oligonucleotides were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry; the observed masses were within 1 Da of the calculated values. Oligonucleotides containing 7,8-dihydro-8-oxodeoxyadenosine (oxoA) or 2-aminopurine deoxyriboside (AP), synthesized on a 0.2 μmol scale and HPLC-purified, were purchased from Oligos Etc., Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). DNA Substrates—The CCCTT-containing scissile strands were 5′ 32P-labeled by enzymatic phosphorylation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled oligonucleotides were gel-purified and hybridized to standard or modified nonscissile strand oligonucleotides at a 1:4 molar ratio of scissile to nonscissile strand. Annealing reaction mixtures containing 0.2 m NaCl and oligonucleotides as specified were heated to 80 °C and then slow-cooled to 22 °C. The hybridized DNAs were stored at 4 °C. The structures of the annealed duplexes and the sequences of the component strands are depicted in the figures. Vaccinia Topoisomerase—Recombinant vaccinia topoisomerase was produced in Escherichia coli (BL21) by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (2) and then purified to apparent homogeneity from the soluble bacterial lysate by phosphocellulose and Source S-15 chromatography steps. Protein concentration was determined by using the dye binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Single-turnover DNA Cleavage—Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 5′ 32P-labeled DNA substrate, and 75 or 150 ng (2 or 4 pmol) of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C. The reactions were initiated by the addition of topoisomerase to prewarmed reaction mixtures. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn at the times specified and quenched immediately with SDS (1% final concentration). The products were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.1% SDS. Free DNA migrated near the dye front. Covalent complex formation was revealed by transfer of radiolabeled DNA to the topoisomerase protein. The extent of covalent complex formation was quantified by scanning the dried gel with a Fujifilm BAS-2500 imager. A plot of the percentage of input DNA cleaved versus time established the end point values for cleavage. The data were then normalized to the end point values (defined as 100%), and the cleavage rate constants (k cl) were calculated by fitting the normalized data to the equation 100 - % cleavage(norm) = 100e -kt. Cleavage Site Specificity—Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of unmodified or BPdA-modified 34-mer/18-mer DNA, and 75 ng of vaccinia topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for either 5 min (unmodified, -2S and -2R BPdA), 4 h (+1R and +1S BPdA), 7 h (+2S BPdA), or 10 h (+2R BPdA). The reactions were quenched with 1% SDS. Half of the sample was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K, and the other half was not digested. The mixtures were adjusted to 47% formamide, heat-denatured, and analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). The reaction products were visualized by autoradiographic exposure of the gel. Single-turnover Religation by the Suicide Intermediate—Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 0.3 pmol of the 18-mer/30-mer DNA (containing either an A:T or G:C base pair at position -1) and 75 ng of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C to form the suicide intermediate. Religation was initiated by the simultaneous addition of NaCl to 0.5 m concentration and a 5′ hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer acceptor strand, either d(ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA), d(GTTCCGATAGTGACTACA), or d(oxoGTTCCGATAGTGACTACA) to a concentration of 15 pmol/22 μl (i.e. a 50-fold molar excess over the input DNA substrate). Aliquots (22 μl) were withdrawn at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, and 300 s and quenched immediately in an equal volume of buffer containing 2% SDS, 76% formamide, and 20 mm EDTA. A time 0 sample was withdrawn before the addition of the acceptor strand. The samples were heat-denatured and then analyzed by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. Religation of the covalently bound 12-mer strand to the 18-mer acceptor DNA will yield a 5′ 32P-labeled 30-mer strand transfer product. The extent of religation (expressed as the percent of the input labeled 18-mer strand recovered as 30-mer) was plotted as a function of reaction time. The data were normalized to the end point values, and k rel was determined by fitting the data to the equation (100 - %Relnorm) = 100e -kt. Equilibrium Cleavage—Three 30-mer CCCTT-containing DNA oligonucleotides, 5′-d(CGTGTCGCCCTT↓ATTACGATAGTGACTACA), 5′-d(CGTGTCGCCCTT↓GTTCCGATAGTGACTACA), and 5′-d(CGTGTCGCCCTT↓oxoGTTCCGATAGTGACTACA), were 5′ 32P-labeled, then gel-purified and annealed to unlabeled complementary 30-mer strands to form duplexes containing 12 bp of DNA 5′ of the topoisomerase cleavage site (↓) and 18 bp 3′ of the cleavage site. Cleavage reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.3 pmol of 30-mer/30-mer DNA, and 9, 18, 37, 75, 150, or 300 ng of topoisomerase were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was quenched by adding SDS to 0.5%. The samples were then digested for 60 min at 45 °C with 10 μg of proteinase K. The volume was adjusted to 100 μl, and the digests were then extracted with an equal volume of phenol/chloroform. DNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The pelleted material was resuspended in formamide and analyzed by electrophoreses through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE. The cleavage product, a 32P-labeled 12-mer bound to a short peptide, was well resolved from the input 30-mer substrate. The extent of strand cleavage was quantitated by scanning the gel. Position-specific BPdA Interference Effects on DNA Transesterification—Oligodeoxynucleotide 18-mers containing a single C-10 S or R BPdA adduct at positions +2, +1, or -2 of the nonscissile strand sequence 3′-G+5G+4G+3A+2A+1T-1A-2 were synthesized and then annealed to a 5′ 32P-labeled 34-mer scissile strand to form “suicide” cleavage substrates for vaccinia topoisomerase (Fig. 1B). The cleavage transesterification reaction results in covalent attachment of the 32P-labeled 12-mer 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp to the enzyme via Tyr-274. The unlabeled 22-mer 5′-OH-leaving strand dissociates spontaneously from the protein-DNA complex. Loss of the leaving strand drives the reaction toward the covalent state, so that the reaction can be treated kinetically as a first-order unidirectional process. The reaction of excess topoisomerase with the unmodified control substrate attained an end point at which 90% of the DNA was converted to covalent topoisomerase-DNA complex; the reaction was complete within 20 s. The extent of transesterification after 5 s was 85% of the end point value. From this datum, we calculated a single-turnover cleavage rate constant (k cl) of 0.42 s-1 (Fig. 1B). We found that S and R BPdA modifications at position +1A slowed the transesterification rate to 0.0004 and 0.0006 s-1, respectively, without significantly affecting the yield of covalently bound DNA at the reaction end point (81–87%). The k obs for cleavage of the BPdA-modified substrates did not increase when the concentration of topoisomerase in the reaction mixture was increased 2-fold (not shown), suggesting that the slowed cleavage rates were not caused by a defect in initial noncovalent binding of topoisomerase to the substrate. Thus, the +1 BPdA adducts elicited 700–1000-fold rate decrements; there was no significant stereoisomer effect. The S and R BPdA modifications at +2A reduced k cl to 0.0018 and 0.00006 s-1, respectively. The extents of transesterification were also reduced, so that only 18–22% of the input DNA became covalently bound to the enzyme. Neither the rate nor the end point increased when the concentration of topoisomerase was doubled, implying that the reaction was not limited by the noncovalent binding step. Rather, we surmise that the majority of the topoisomerase binding events on the +2 BPdA substrates were nonproductive with respect to transesterification and that there was not a free equilibrium between productive and nonproductive binding modes (at least not within the 24-h time frame that the reactions were monitored). Thus, +2 BPdA adducts elicited rate decrements of 200- and 7000-fold for the S and R diastereomers, respectively, with a significant stereospecific interference effect (S/R = 30). Note that the interference effect was greater when the +2 BPdA adduct was intercalated on the 5′ side facing toward the scissile phosphodiester (Fig. 1B). BPdA adducts at the -2 position had no effect on the extent of the reaction and relatively little impact on the rate of cleavage compared with the BPdA adducts within the 3-GGGAA recognition motif. The cleavage rate constants were 0.05 and 0.23 s-1 for the -2 S and R BPdA diastereomers, respectively. The modest stereoselective effect at the -2A position (R/S = 4) is such that interference occurred only when the BPdA adduct was intercalated on the 3′ side facing toward the scissile phosphodiester. Taken together, the BPdA interference effects define the -1 base pair as the “downstream” margin of the functional interface between DNA and vaccinia topoisomerase that can be affected significantly by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon intercalation (Fig. 1B).

https://openalex.org/W2079865397,"A functional cysteine-less form of the hamster reduced folate carrier protein was generated by alanine replacement of the 14 cysteine residues. The predicted 12-transmembrane topology was examined by replacing selected amino acids, predicted to be exposed to the extracellular or cytosolic environments, with cysteines. The location of these cysteines was defined by their accessibility to biotin maleimide in the presence or absence of specific blocking agents. Amino acids predicted to be exposed to the extracellular environment (S46C, S179C, L300C, Y355C, and K430C) could be labeled with biotin maleimide; this modification could be blocked by prior treatment with nonpermeable reagents. Amino acids predicted to be within the cytosol (S152C, Cys224, and L475C) could be labeled only after streptolysin O permeabilization. In addition, the cysteine-less reduced folate carrier was exploited to evaluate a potential substrate-binding domain as suggested by previous studies. Nineteen cysteine replacements were generated between residues 39 and 75, a region located between the first and second transmembrane segments. From the biotinylation of these sites and the ability of various reagents to block this labeling, it appears that L41C, E45C, S46C, T49C, I66C, and L70C are exposed to the extracellular environment, whereas Q54C, Q61C, and T63C are slightly less accessible. Cysteines 39, 42, 44, 47, 51, and 73 were inefficiently biotinylated, suggesting that these sites are located in the membrane or within a tightly folded domain of the protein. Furthermore, biotinylation of cysteines 41, 46, 49, 70, and 71 could be prevented by prior treatment with either methotrexate or folinic acid, indicating that these sites form part of a substrate-binding pocket."

The 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol is a rate-limiting step in the catabolic conversion of cholesterol to bile acids, and 27-hydroxycholesterol is a regulatory oxysterol that indirectly modulates cholesterol synthesis in the liver and other tissues (5Jelinek D. Andersson S. Slaughter C. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8190-8197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bjorkhem J. Danielsson H. Sjovall J. Sterols and Bile acids.

Extrahepatic CYP27 also converts cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol or 3-hydroxy-5-cholestanoic acid (8Björkhem I. Andersson O. Diczfalusy U. Sevastik B. Xiu R.-J. Duan C. Lund E. Proc. Natl.

Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), which are then transported to the liver and converted into bile acids. Similarly, CYP27 catalyzes 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D3 in the hepatic mitochondria, a first step in the conversion of inactive vitamin D3 to the 1α,25-dihydroxy derivative, which is an active hormonal form (10Deluca H.F. Schnoes H.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1976; 45: 631-666Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Friedlander E.J. Norman A.W. Arch. Biochem.

Vitamin D3 hormone, a known regulator of mineral metabolism and calcium homeostasis, has more recently been implicated in a number of other biological activities not yet fully understood but clearly related to immunological responses, cell proliferation, and differentiation (11Friedlander E.J. Norman A.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 170: 731-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Deluca H.F. Harvey Lect. 1980; 75: 333-379Google Scholar, 13Henery H.L. Norman A.

Hormones and Their Action, Part 1. Elsevier, Amsterdam1988: 269-289Google Scholar). In other minor pathways, extrahepatic CYP27 also catalyzes 1α hydroxylation and (24R)-hydroxylation steps in the kidney. Previously published results report two distinct mRNAs in the rat that code for the synthesis of a similarly sized 55-kDa CYP27 precursor protein (1Su P. Rennert I. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zheng Y.M. Addya S. Strauss J.F. Avadhani N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The larger 2.3-kb mRNA is predominant but identical to the 1.9-kb mRNA except for a 400-nucleotide 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) extension. This 400-nt extension exhibits several unique characteristics, as shown in Fig. 1, which include a polyadenylation signal near the 5′-end; six upstream AUG codons, with the first five forming five upstream open reading frames (uORFs) up to 105 nt long and the sixth AUG initiating a 57-kDa extension of the main open reading frame (ORF); two stem loop structures between nt 184 and 204 and nt 357 and 375; and 100% sequence complementarity between the terminal 290 nucleotides of 2.3-kb mRNA and the 5′-translated region of serine protease inhibitor (SPI-2) mRNA (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rossi V. Rouayrenc J.F. Paquereau L. Vilarem M. LeCam A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19947-19954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence overlap between CYP27 and SPI-2 mRNAs is unique and probably represents the first observation of 5′-end overlap between two functional mRNAs. The formation of RNA duplexes between complementary RNA sequences has been reported in several cell systems (18Krystal G.W. Armstrong B.C. Battey J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4180-4191Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 19Kim S.K. Wold B.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 129-13819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 20Adelman J.P. Bond T. Douglass J. Herbert T. Science. 1987; 235: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In the same way, the existence of an RNA duplex formed between the complementary sequences of CYP27 and SPI mRNAs in liver and COS cells was previously demonstrated and shown to have a regulatory role in CYP27 mRNA translation (21Shayiq R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4050-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the extent of inhibition of translation did not measure up to the extent to which CYP27 mRNA was involved in duplex formation, suggesting that processing of the RNA duplex is taking place to minimize the inhibitory effect on translation. Furthermore, the presence of a long 5′-UTR in 2.3-kb CYP27 mRNA suggests that complex regulatory mechanisms are involved in the synthesis of CYP27 similar to other known regulatory proteins such as growth factors, cytokine receptors, and protooncogenes (22Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 23Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 192-225Crossref Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Mullick et al. (24Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) reported isolation of the rat CYP27 gene comprising 11 exons encoding the entire 2.3-kb mRNA. They identified and characterized a distinct transcription promoter within the 5′-terminal region of exon 2 that was shown to drive the expression of the shorter 2-kb mRNA, suggesting that the two mRNAs that represent CYP27 in rat liver are products of the same gene locus but have two independent promoter regions. They identified an immediate upstream promoter for 2-kb mRNA within exon 2 that represents nt 291–447 of 2.3-kb mRNA. However, the characterization of promoter elements that would drive the expression of the 2.3-kb mRNA have not, so far, been reported. Mullick et al. (24Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have also provided evidence that suggests that the 2.0-kb mRNA, and not the 2.3-kb mRNA, is the predominant CYP27 mRNA in rat liver. In the current report, we revalidate that the 2.3-kb mRNA is the predominant form of CYP27 mRNA in rat liver and thus disagree with the report of Mullick et al. (24Mullick J. Addya S. Sucharov C. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13729-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We present an analysis of the mode of CYP27 mRNA translation and how uORFs can regulate the initiation of its translation from the seventh AUG. Our results demonstrate that uORF1 regulates the synthesis of a 55-kDa CYP27 precursor in a way that prevents its accumulation in the cytosol. This regulatory mechanism, however, is lost with the deletion of uORF1, which also allows initiation of translation to take place equally from the sixth and the seventh AUGs. The presented evidence of uORF1 expression establishes the bicistronic nature of wild type 2.3-kb CYP27 mRNA. It is also suggested that following the uORF1 translation, synthesis of CYP27 protein involves reinitiation of translation from the seventh AUG. Together, these observations provide further proof that uORFs in mammalian mRNAs, like those in yeast, may manage access of ribosomes to authentic downstream AUG sites and regulate their translation accordingly (25Grant C.M. Miller P.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3980-3988Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Hinnebusch A.G. Hershey J.W.B Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 199-244Google Scholar). Materials—The chemicals and biochemicals used were of the highest purity grades purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Radiolabeled materials such as [32P]dCTP, [32P]UTP (6000 Ci/mmol), and [35S] methionine (600 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Nytran and nitrocellulose membranes for various blot transfers were obtained from Schleicher & Schuell. Alkaline phosphate-conjugated secondary antibody, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, RNasin, rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), and some restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega. The Amplitaq PCR fragment sequencing kit and PCR kits were supplied by PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The in vitro transcription kit and other restriction enzymes were purchased from Stratagene. Reagents for polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. The sources for pCMV4 vector and SPI-2 have been described before (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion Plasmid Constructs—The wild-type 2.3-kb cDNA (WT2.3) cloned into Bluescript vector (WT2.3BS) and pCMV vector (WT2.3pCMV) has been described previously (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Shayiq R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4050-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Also, WTd410 represents the 1.9-kb cDNA as described before (1Su P. Rennert I. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zheng Y.M. Addya S. Strauss J.F. Avadhani N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The deletion constructs WTd160 and WTd331 were prepared from WT2.3BS by using restriction sites EcoRV-XbaI and EcoRV-SmaI, respectively. Another deletion construct, WTd280, was prepared by using exonuclease III according to Sambrook et al. (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Internal deletion constructs, WTd291–331 and WTd291–410, were prepared as follows. An antisense primer PrDel-1 (5′-TGATCCCATTGAGCCTCTACAAGAAGC-3′) with 5′ overhangs of 7 nt (underlined) complementary to nt 331–337 of WT2.3 was synthesized and used to amplify the terminal 290 nt of 5′-UTR (5′UTR1–290) with M13 reverse primer from the vector. Also, sense primer PrS-3 (5′-GGGATCACCTCTGCCTTTAA-3′) was used to amplify the downstream translated region 331–2300 with M13 forward primer from the vector. The two amplified fragments were mixed in an equimolar ratio, denatured at 95 °C for 4 min, and chilled on ice, and the fragments that annealed at their 5′-ends were first extended with T4 DNA polymerase and then amplified with T3 and T7 primers. The same procedures were employed to generate the deletion mutant WTd291–410 using PrDel-2 (5′-AGCCAGAATTGAGCCTCTACAAGAAGC-3′) and PrS-4 (5′-TCTGGCTCTAAACTCTTGGC-3′) primers. The amplified products with 291–331-nt and 291–410-nt deletions were cut with HindIII and SpeI restriction enzymes and cloned in pCMV4 and Bluescript vectors. Mutant Plasmid Constructs—Mutant forms of WT2.3 to eliminate the first stop codon (WTm278) and the seventh AUG (WTm450) and to weaken the nucleotide context of the seventh AUG (WTm448) were generated by in vitro site-directed mutagenesis using an asymmetric polymerase chain reaction method as described previously (28Shayiq R.M. Black M. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 206-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Three synthetic antisense primers PrM278 (5′-CATTGAGCCTCGAGAAGAAGCTG-3′), PrM448 (5′-GGCTCAACACATCGATAGATCGTGT-3′), and PrM450 (5′-GGCTCAACACGTACATAGATCGTGT-3′) were used to generate the mutations and at the same time introduce cloning site XhoI, ClaI, and RsaI, respectively. The introduction of these restriction sites helped generate other constructs as described below. CAT Plasmid Constructs—A CAT construct WT-IFCAT was generated by cutting WTm450 with ClaI and then partially with SmaI to release the 1850-nt fragment. The 1850-nt fragment was replaced with a 1.5-kb AccI-HincII CAT fragment isolated from pCAT-Basic (Promega), which leaves CAT AUG in-frame from the sixth AUG of CYP27 mRNA. A CAT construct WT-OFCAT was generated by blunt ending the ClaI site and then cloning a 1.5-kb HincII-HincII CAT fragment isolated from pCAT-Basic instead of AccI and HincII CAT fragment. In this way, CAT AUG is inserted out-of-frame from the sixth AUG. CAT constructs d331-IFCAT and d331-OFCAT were prepared by deleting the HindIII and SmaI fragment from the 5′-ends of WT-IFCAT and WT-OFCAT, respectively. A CAT construct, d280-IFCAT, was prepared by using exonuclease III. The CAT control was prepared by cloning HincII-cut 1.5-kb CAT fragment in pCMV4 (CATpCMV). Bicistronic Plasmid Constructs—Three bicistronic clones, CW2.3, CWd331, and CWd445, containing CAT as the first cistron and CYP27 as the second cistron with varying lengths of the CYP27 5′-UTR separating the two cistrons were constructed for in vivo expression and in vitro transcription and translation studies as follows. The HindIII restriction site present just upstream of 5′-ends of WT2.3BS and WTd331 was cut and blunt ended, and a HincII-cut 1.5-kb CAT fragment was cloned in right orientation to form CW2.3 and CWd331. The WTd445 deletion mutant was prepared by using exonuclease III as described above and used to construct a CWd445 bicistronic clone by cloning a HincII-cut 1.5-kb CAT fragment at the 5′-end in the right orientation as described above. Similarly, three bicistronic constructs were prepared in the expression vector pCDNA3 for transfection in COS cells. Epitope Tag Plasmid Construction—A DNA sequence encoding the c-Myc epitope, KLISEED, was inserted into the C-terminal end of the uORF1 of the CYP27 2.3-kb mRNA by manipulation with PCR. Two oligonucleotide primers, PrEpi-1 (5′-GTCCTCCTCGCTGATCAGCTTCAAGAAGCTGGCTTTGAGGA-3′) and PrEpi-2 (5′-AAGCTGATCAGCGAGGAGGACTAGAGGCTCAATGGTTATGAA-3′) were synthesized with a 3′ overlap of 21 nt (underlined), representing the c-Myc epitope. PrEpi-1, an antisense primer, was used to amplify the 5′ region (nt 1–278) with M13 reverse primer from the vector. In the same way, PrEpi-2, a sense primer, was used to amplify the 3′ region (279–2300 nt) with the help of M13 forward primer from the vector. The two amplified fragments were mixed in an equimolar ratio, denatured at 95 °C for 4 min, and chilled on ice, and the fragments that annealed at their c-Myc epitope overhangs were extended with T4 DNA polymerase and then amplified with T3 and T7 primers. The amplified product with c-Myc epitope insertion was cut with HindIII and SpeI restriction enzymes and cloned in pCDNA3 (WTEpi) vector. Cell Culture and Expression—COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four h after plating on 10-cm dishes, cells were subjected to transfection by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (1Su P. Rennert I. Shayiq R.M. Yamamoto R. Zheng Y.M. Addya S. Strauss J.F. Avadhani N.G. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

Each 10-cm COS cell dish was transfected with 10 μg of plasmid DNA. The COS cells were harvested 44 h after transfection for RNA isolation and 68 h after transfection for CAT assay and Western blot analysis. Expression of CYP27 protein was monitored by Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibody to CYP27 as a probe as described before (29Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 28: 7546-7554Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 30Addya S. Zheng Y. Shayiq R.M. Fan J. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 19947-19954Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). COS cell lysates were prepared and used for CAT assay essentially as described before (31Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5294) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling and Immunoprecipitation—For the analysis of epitope-tagged ORF expression in the 5′-UTR of CYP27 mRNA, confluent COS cells in 35-mm dishes were transfected with WTEpi DNA as described above. At 44 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced with methionine-free minimal essential medium supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to deplete intracellular pools of methionine, after which cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]Met at 200 μCi/ml for 2 h as described (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Following the pulse labeling, cells were harvested in PBS buffer, and after centrifugation the cell pellet was suspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO3). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes for immunoprecipitation. c-Myc epitope-specific primary antibody (1 μg) was added, and samples were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with mixing. Following the primary incubation, 50 μl of protein G coupled to Sepharose (50% slurry) was added, and incubation continued for an additional 2 h at room temperature. The beads were spun down, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in 40 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min to denature the proteins. After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant were subjected to electrophoresis on 12–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to fluorography. Northern Blot and RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated by the acid guanidine thiocynate-phenol chloroform technique of Chomezynski and Sacchi (32Chomezynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Denatured total RNA was resolved on long 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gels for better separation of RNAs and transferred to nylon membranes as described before (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Two 32P-labeled antisense single-stranded probes, nt 1–290 (SS-UTR probe) and nt 507–699 (SSTR probe), were generated essentially as described before (21Shayiq R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4050-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SS-UTR probe from the 5′-UTR is capable of hybridizing to only 2.3-kb mRNA, whereas SS-TR probe from the translated region can hybridize to both 2.3- and 2.0-kb CYP27 mRNAs on the same blot. Hybridizations in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C for 18–24 h and posthybridization washing of the blots were carried out as described before (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, 10 μg of total female and male rat liver RNAs were denatured in the presence of 25 pmol each of PrAS-4 (5′-GTCTCCTTAATCACAGCTTT-3′) and PrS-2 (5′-GCAGCTGAGATGCTAAGAGGGGA-3′) primers for 4 min, quenched on ice, and reverse transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase in a 20-μl total volume as described before (21Shayiq R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4050-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PrAS-4 was added to generate complementary DNA strand, whereas the addition of PrS-2 was necessary to bring RT reaction of 2.3-kb mRNA to completion with PrAS-4 primer. The addition of PrS-2 most likely helps by preventing the predominant SPI mRNAs from forming a duplex with the CYP27 mRNA. Half of the RT reaction mixture was amplified using primers PrAS-4 and PrS-2, and the other half was amplified with primers PrAS-4 and PrS-5 (5′-TTGAGCCGCATGAGACTGAG-3′). PCR was performed for 25 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 1.5 min. At 25 cycles, the reactions were in the linear range, which was determined by quantifying the product accumulation at different cycle numbers. The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining, and the bands were scanned for quantification. S1 Nuclease and RNase Protection Assays—A single-stranded probe complementary to nt 159–448 of the 5′-UTR (289 S1 probe) was prepared by the oligonucleotide-primed extension of CYP27 cDNA using an antisense oligonucleotide primer PrAS-3 (5′-ATAGATCGTGTCTGAGAAGC-3′) essentially as described before (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). About 5 × 105 cpm of the probe was hybridized with 10 μg of total RNA in the presence of 80% formamide for 16 h at 30 °C and digested with 200 units of S1 nuclease at 30 °C for 30 min as described before (15Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2421-2428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S1-resistant fragments were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% sequencing gel. For RNase protection assay, a 5′ fragment from CAT cDNA cloned in pGEM-3Z was used to synthesize a [32P]UTP-labeled RNA probe by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). The 471-nt CAT probe contained 439 nt that were complementary to the CAT RNA used in the transfection studies. The RNase A protection assay was performed essentially as described before (21Shayiq R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4050-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNase-protected RNA species were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and electrophoresed on a 6% acrylamide, 8 m urea gel. In Vitro Transcription, Translation, and Immunoprecipitation—For in vitro transcription and translation, commercially available kits from Promega Biotech were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid constructs WTm278, WTm450, WTm448, WTd331, and WT2.3 cloned in Bluescript vector were linearized with SpeI at the 3′-end of the coding sequence to produce “run-off” transcripts derived from the insert sequence using T3 RNA polymerase. RNA transcripts were quantified by the absorbance at 260 nm, and integrity was verified by gel analysis. Total RNA isolated from COS cells or RNA transcripts generated in vitro were used as templates for in vitro translation in an RRL system (33Niranjan B.G. Raza H. Shayiq R.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Each native RNA (10 μg) or RNA transcript (1 μg) was denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and then cooled to 37 °C in 20–30 min before being subjecting to in vitro translation. In vitro translation was carried out in a 24-μl reaction volume containing 1 μCi of [35S]methionine/μl as described before (33Niranjan B.G. Raza H. Shayiq R.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Shayiq R.M. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 866-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In vitro translation products containing about 1 × 107 acid-precipitable cpm were solubilized by boiling in 0.1 ml of a buffer containing 1% SDS. Twenty μl of solubilized translation product was directly loaded on the gel, whereas the rest was immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to CYP27 (20 μg of ammonium sulfate-fractionated IgG) or CAT essentially as described before (33Niranjan B.G. Raza H. Shayiq R.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N"
