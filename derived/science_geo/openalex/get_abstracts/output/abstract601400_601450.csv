Mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cells have been derived and used as the best in vitro model for molecular and functional analysis of mouse trophoblast lineages, but attempts to derive human TS cells have so far been unsuccessful. Here we show that activation of Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and EGF and inhibition of TGF-β, histone deacetylase (HDAC), and Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) enable long-term culture of human villous cytotrophoblast (CT) cells. The resulting cell lines have the capacity to give rise to the three major trophoblast lineages, which show transcriptomes similar to those of the corresponding primary trophoblast cells. Importantly, equivalent cell lines can be derived from human blastocysts. Our data strongly suggest that the CT- and blastocyst-derived cell lines are human TS cells, which will provide a powerful tool to study human trophoblast development and function.

The placenta is a multifunctional organ essential for fetal development and survival. Trophoblast cells are specialized cells in the placenta that mediate the interactions between the fetus and mother at the feto-maternal interface. In the human placenta, there are three major trophoblast subpopulations: the cytotrophoblast (CT), extravillous cytotrophoblast (EVT), and syncytiotrophoblast (ST) (Bischof and Irminger-Finger, 2005Bischof P.

CT cells are an undifferentiated and proliferative population that can give rise to EVT and ST cells. CT cells aggregate into cell columns at the tips of villi, where they differentiate into EVT cells. EVT cells can be subdivided based on their anatomical locations (Cierna et al., 2016Cierna Z. Varga I. Danihel Jr., L. Kuracinova K. Janegova A. Danihel L. Intermediate trophoblast–A distinctive, unique and often unrecognized population of trophoblastic cells.Ann. Anat. 2016; 204: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Those that invade the decidualized endometrium are called interstitial EVT cells. Those that invade and remodel the spiral arteries are known as endovascular EVTs. Other subtypes likely exist because EVT cells have also been found in uterine glands, veins, and lymphatics (Moser et al., 2010Moser G. Gauster M. Orendi K. Glasner A. Theuerkauf R. Huppertz B.

Multinucleated ST cells are formed by fusion of CT cells and produce large quantities of placental hormones and other factors to maintain pregnancy. ST cells are directly in contact with maternal blood and mediate the exchange of gases and nutrients. All of the trophoblast lineages arise from the trophectoderm (TE) cells of the blastocyst, and their coordinated proliferation and differentiation is essential for a successful pregnancy. Impaired trophoblast development and function are thought to lead to various pregnancy complications, including miscarriage, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction (Moffett and Loke, 2006Moffett A.

Mouse trophoblast stem (TS) cells, which were first derived from blastocysts and the extra-embryonic ectoderm (ExE) of post-implantation embryos (Tanaka et al., 1998Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Promotion of trophoblast stem cell proliferation by FGF4.Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar), are the best in vitro model for molecular and functional analysis of mouse trophoblast cells. In the presence of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)/Activin, mouse TS cells self-renew indefinitely without losing their ability to differentiate into all trophoblast lineages. A number of transcription factors, including Cdx2, Eomes, Elf5, Esrrb, and Gata3, have been identified as essential for maintaining the undifferentiated state of mouse TS cells (Latos and Hemberger, 2016Latos P.A. Hemberger M. From the stem of the placental tree: trophoblast stem cells and their progeny.Development. 2016; 143: 3650-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although it has been assumed that TE cells of human blastocysts and CT cells of early human placentas contain a stem cell population, attempts to derive human TS cells from these cells have so far been unsuccessful (Kunath et al., 2014Kunath T. Yamanaka Y. Detmar J. MacPhee D. Caniggia I. Rossant J. Jurisicova A.

Natale D. Parast M.M. Signaling pathways in mouse and human trophoblast differentiation: a comparative review.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2015; 72: 1291-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In this study, we analyzed the transcriptomes of primary trophoblast cells to infer how CT cells are maintained in their undifferentiated state in vivo. Using this knowledge, we optimized the culture conditions and derived human TS cells from CT cells and blastocysts. Our culture system will provide a powerful tool to study human trophoblast development and function. We isolated CT, EVT, and ST cells from first-trimester placentas (Figures S1A–S1C) and performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) (Table S1). We identified 377, 228, and 289 genes that were predominantly expressed in CT, EVT, and ST cells, respectively (fragments per kilobase per million [FPKM] > 10 in the cell type with the highest expression, fold change > 4, adjusted p < 0.01) (Figure 1A). We confirmed that widely used lineage markers such as ITGA6 and TP63 (CT), ITGA5 and HLA-G (EVT), and CGB and CSH1 (ST) (Bischof and Irminger-Finger, 2005Bischof P. Irminger-Finger I.

We then conducted functional annotation of the gene lists using ConsensusPathDB (Herwig et al., 2016Herwig R. Hardt C. Lienhard M. Kamburov A. Analyzing and interpreting genome data at the network level with ConsensusPathDB.Nat. Protoc. 2016; 11: 1889-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar; Figure 1A). Intriguingly, genes related to the Wingless/Integrated (Wnt) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signal transduction pathways (“regulation of FZD by ubiquitination” and “EGFR1”) were overrepresented in the CT highest (CThighest) gene list. Wnt and EGF signaling are required for proliferation of various epithelial stem cells, including skin stem cells and intestinal stem cells (Fatehullah et al., 2016Fatehullah A. Tan S.H. Barker N. Organoids as an in vitro model of human development and disease.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar, Hsu et al., 2014Hsu Y.C. Li L. Fuchs E. Emerging interactions between skin stem cells and their niches.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Consistently, the top-ranked pathway for the CThighest genes was “hair follicle development,” which included some genes important for the maintenance of hair follicle stem cells (TP63, FGFR2, and CTNNB1 [encoding β-catenin]). These data imply that CT cells might be maintained under conditions similar to those of the other epithelial stem cells. Based on the results described above, we tried to culture CT cells in a medium containing CHIR99021 (a Wnt activator) and EGF, but the cells did not adhere to the culture plate and died within several days. We then tested several inhibitors and growth factors (Figure 1B) that are known to enhance in vitro proliferation of various epithelial stem cells (Fatehullah et al., 2016Fatehullah A. Tan S.H. Barker N. Organoids as an in vitro model of human development and disease.Nat. Cell Biol. 2016; 18: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). In the presence of all of these inhibitors and growth factors, highly proliferative cell lines were derived from CT cells (condition 1 in Figure 1B and Figure S1D). Among the inhibitors and growth factors, Y27632 (a Rho-associated protein kinase [ROCK] inhibitor) was found to be essential for cell attachment and was added to all culture media in subsequent experiments. CHIR99021 was indispensable for cell proliferation, and its absence led to differentiation of CT cells into HLA-G-positive EVT-like cells (Figure S1E). EGF, A83-01, and SB431542 (TGF-β inhibitors) and valproic acid (VPA) (a histone deacetylase [HDAC] inhibitor) significantly enhanced proliferation of CT cells (Figure 1B). Eventually, we found that CHIR99021, EGF, TGF-β inhibitors, VPA, and Y27632 together were sufficient for long-term culture of CT cells (Figure 1C). We were able to derive proliferative CT cells from as few as 1,000 CT cells (five cell lines from five independent experiments) but failed to derive TS cells from single CT cells (n = 200). CHIR99021, EGF, TGF-β inhibitors, and VPA were all important for the long-term maintenance of proliferative CT cells (Figure S1F). VPA could be replaced by trichostatin A (TSA) or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (Figure S1G). Although either A83-01 or SB431542 could support the derivation of proliferative CT cells (Figure S1H), we retained both inhibitors in consideration of their different specificities (Vogt et al., 2011Vogt J. Traynor R. Sapkota G.P. The specificities of small molecule inhibitors of the TGFß and BMP pathways.Cell. Signal. 2011; 23: 1831-1842Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The culture conditions tested in this study are summarized in Table S2. We successfully derived proliferative CT cell lines from all first-trimester placental samples tested (n = 8) (Table S3). In contrast, we were unable to derive such cells from term placentas (placentas obtained after elective caesarean section, n = 5) under the same conditions. The proliferative CT cells had a normal karyotype (Figure S1I) and continued to proliferate for at least 5 months (∼150 population doublings) (Figure 1D). These cells expressed a pan-trophoblast marker, KRT7 (Figure 1E), but HLA-ABC expression was very low (Figure 1F), which is a hallmark of CT cells (King et al., 2000King A. Thomas L. Bischof P. Cell culture models of trophoblast II: trophoblast cell lines–a workshop report.Placenta. 2000; 21: S113-S119Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). They also expressed TP63 and TEAD4 (CT markers) and GATA3 (a mononuclear trophoblast marker) (Figure 1G). The proliferative CT cells were designated CT-derived TS cells (TSCT cells) because they had the ability to differentiate into EVT- and ST-like cells as detailed below. To analyze the differentiation potential of TSCT cells, we first cultured TS cells in a basal medium containing only Y27632. Most of the cells differentiated into multinucleated ST-like cells, but some cells remained mononucleated (Figure S2A). The culture conditions did not support the survival of the differentiated cells, and most of them died within 5 days. Therefore, additional factor(s) may be required for the efficient and directed differentiation of TSCT cells. Matrigel is widely used to induce outgrowth of EVT cells from placental explants (Miller et al., 2005Miller R.K. Genbacev O. Turner M.A. Aplin J.D. Caniggia I. Huppertz B. Human placental explants in culture: approaches and assessments.Placenta. 2005; 26: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). A recent study also revealed that decidua-derived NRG1 promotes EVT formation in placental explant cultures (Fock et al., 2015Fock V. Plessl K. Draxler P. Otti G.R. Fiala C. Knöfler M. Pollheimer J. Neuregulin-1-mediated ErbB2-ErbB3 signalling protects human trophoblasts against apoptosis to preserve differentiation.J. Cell Sci. 2015; 128: 4306-4316Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition, CT cells preferentially differentiated into EVT-like cells under condition 2 shown in Figure 1B (see also Figure S1E). Among the inhibitors and growth factors contained in condition 2, the TGF-β inhibitors were found to promote differentiation of CT cells into EVT-like cells, and A83-01 was more potent than SB431542 (Figure S2B). In a culture system containing NRG1, A83-01, and Matrigel (Figure 2A), TSCT cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Figure 2B; Figure S2C) and gave rise to EVT-like cells that strongly expressed HLA-G (Figure 2C). The resulting cells were named EVT-TSCT cells. We confirmed that NRG1, A83-01, and Matrigel were all important for the induction of EVT-TSCT cells (Figure S2D). ITGA6 and CDH1 (CT markers), SDC1 (an ST marker), and VIM (a stromal marker) expression was low or undetectable in EVT-TSCT cells (Figure 2G). CGB (an ST marker) is expressed at low levels in EVT cells (Pröll et al., 2000Pröll J. Bensussan A. Goffin F. Foidart J.M. Berrebi A. Le Bouteiller P. Tubal versus uterine placentation: similar HLA-G expressing extravillous cytotrophoblast invasion but different maternal leukocyte recruitment.Tissue Antigens. 2000; 56: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and, consistently, was detectable in EVT-TSCT cells (Figure 2G). Previous studies on choriocarcinoma cell lines revealed that cyclic AMP (cAMP) enhances ST formation (Strauss et al., 1992Strauss 3rd, J.F. Kido S. Sayegh R. Sakuragi N. Gåfvels M.E. The cAMP signalling system and human trophoblast function.Placenta. 1992; 13: 389-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, we treated TSCT cells with forskolin, a cAMP agonist (Figure 2A). In the presence of forskolin, the cells started to make aggregates and efficiently fused to form large syncytia (Figures 2D and 2E; Figure S2E). The ST markers CGB and SDC1 were highly expressed in these syncytia, whereas ITGA6, CDH1, HLA-G, and VIM were poorly expressed (Figure 2G). The ST-like syncytia were designated ST(2D)-TSCT cells. It has also been reported that 3D culture enhances differentiation of choriocarcinoma cells into ST-like cells (McConkey et al., 2016McConkey C.A. Delorme-Axford E. Nickerson C.A. Kim K.S. Sadovsky Y. Boyle J.P. Coyne C.B. A three-dimensional culture system recapitulates placental syncytiotrophoblast development and microbial resistance.Sci. Adv. 2016; 2: e1501462Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, we cultured the proliferative CT cells in low adhesion plates (Figure 2A). These cells formed cyst-like structures (Figure 2F), expressed CGB and SDC1 (Figure 2H), and secreted a large amount of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (Figure 2I). Forskolin and EGF synergistically enhanced the formation of the cyst-like structures (Figure S2F). These cyst-like structures were designated ST(3D)-TSCT cells. Expression of ST markers was higher in ST(3D)-TSCT cells than in ST(2D)-TSCT cells (Figure S2G). TSCT cells maintained their ability to differentiate into EVT- and ST-like cells after 50 passages (Figures S2H and S2I). We also cultured single TSCT cells (n = 50) and isolated 10 clonal lines (Figure 2J). We randomly selected three clonal lines and confirmed that they could differentiate into both EVT- and ST-like cells (Figures 2K and 2L), suggesting that individual TSCT cells were bipotent. We next investigated whether cells similar to TSCT cells could be derived directly from human blastocysts. Sixteen blastocysts were cultured under the same conditions (Figure 3A), and eight cell lines were established. These cell lines, designated blastocyst-derived TS cells (TSblast cells), were morphologically similar to TSCT cells (Figure 3B). A normal karyotype was confirmed in all six TSblast cell lines examined (Figure S3A; Table S3). TSblast cells continued to proliferate for at least 5 months (Figure 3B). As in the case of TSCT cells, TSblast cells expressed KRT7, TP63, GATA3, and TEAD4 (Figures 3C and 3D), and HLA-ABC expression was very low (Figure S3B). Furthermore, TSblast cells had the ability to differentiate into EVT-TSblast (Figures 3E and 3F), ST(2D)-TSblast (Figures 3G–3I), and ST(3D)-TSblast cells (Figures 3J and 3K) just as TSCT cells did (Figure 2A), although two TSblast lines (4 and 7) differentiated into EVT-like cells less efficiently than the other TSblast and TSCT lines (Figures S3C and S3D). The differentiation ability of TSblast cells was maintained after 55 passages (Figures S3E and S3F). We also cultured single TSblast cells (n = 50) and isolated 8 clonal lines. We randomly selected three clonal lines and confirmed that they could differentiate into both EVT- and ST-like cells (Figures 3L and 3M). To determine whether TSCT and TSblast cells had gene expression patterns similar to primary trophoblast cells, we performed RNA-seq of TSCT and TSblast cells and their derivatives (Figure 4A). A preliminary investigation suggested that ST(2D) and ST(3D) cells had very similar transcriptome profiles, but ST(3D) cells were a little more similar to primary ST cells (Figure S4A). Therefore, we chose ST(3D) cells as the model of ST cells. We compared the RNA-seq data with those of primary trophoblast cells and placenta-derived stromal cells. Hierarchical clustering revealed that TSCT and TSblast cells had very similar gene expression patterns to each other, both before and after their differentiation (R > 0.98) (Figure 4A). Importantly, the gene expression profiles of CT cells were closest to those of TSCT and TSblast cells (Figure 4A). The profiles of TSCT- and TSblast-derived EVT- and ST-like cells were closely related to those of primary EVT and ST cells, respectively (Figure 4A). Furthermore, most of the genes predominantly expressed in CT, EVT, or ST cells (the genes shown in Figure 1A) showed similar expression patterns in TSCT and TSblast cells and their derivatives (Figure 4B). We then focused on some representative lineage markers. All CT markers we examined exhibited the expected expression patterns, although some genes, such as LRP5, TP63, and ELF5, showed lower expression in TSCT and TSblast cells (Figure 4C). Most EVT and ST markers also showed comparable expression patterns and levels in the primary and cultured cells, with a few exceptions (e.g., CD9 and CSH1) (Figures 4D and 4E). Although TSCT and TSblast cells had gene expression profiles similar to those of primary cells, they were not exactly the same, presumably reflecting the artificial in vitro conditions. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that genes associated with various gene ontology (GO) terms were differentially expressed between the primary and cultured cells. Notably, genes related to ribosome biogenesis were especially enriched in TS cells (Figure S4B), which might contribute to TS cell proliferation because ribosomes drive cell proliferation and growth. We also found that DNA replication-related genes were significantly depleted in TS-derived EVT-like cells (Figure S4C), consistent with our observation that TS cells differentiating into EVT-like cells gradually lost their proliferative capacity. Several genes such as CYP19A1, EDNRB, IL2RB, and PTN are reported to have placenta-specific promoters (Cohen et al., 2011Cohen C.J. Rebollo R. Babovic S. Dai E.L. Robinson W.P. Mager D.L. Placenta-specific expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor β subunit from an endogenous retroviral promoter.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 35543-35552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Rawn and Cross, 2008Rawn S.M. Cross J.C. The evolution, regulation, and function of placenta-specific genes.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2008; 24: 159-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We found that these placenta-specific promoters were active in ST(3D)-TSCT and ST(3D)-TSblast cells (Figure S4D). As shown in Figure 4C, FGFR2 was predominantly expressed in CT cells and undifferentiated TSCT and TSblast cells. We found that, of the two major isoforms of FGFR2 (FGFR2b and FGFR2c), FGFR2b was expressed almost exclusively (Figure S4E). This is intriguing because the essential role of Fgfr2c was reported in mouse trophoblast cells (Arman et al., 1998Arman E. Haffner-Krausz R. Chen Y. Heath J.K. Lonai P. Targeted disruption of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor 2 suggests a role for FGF signaling in pregastrulation mammalian development.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1998; 95: 5082-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CDX2, EOMES, ESRRB, and SOX2, which encode transcription factors required for mouse TS cell self-renewal (Latos and Hemberger, 2016Latos P.A. Hemberger M. From the stem of the placental tree: trophoblast stem cells and their progeny.Development. 2016; 143: 3650-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were poorly expressed (< 1 FPKM) in CT, TSCT, and TSblast cells (Table S1). Trophoblast cells have unique DNA methylation patterns characterized by large partially methylated domains (PMDs) (Schroeder et al., 2013Schroeder D.I. Blair J.D. Lott P. Yu H.O. Hong D. Crary F. Ashwood P. Walker C. Korf I. Robinson W.P. LaSalle J.M. The human placenta methylome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), placenta-specific promoter hypomethylation (Robinson and Price, 2015Robinson W.P. Price E.M. The human placental methylome.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Med. 2015; 5: a023044Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and placenta-specific germline differentially methylated regions (gDMRs) (Court et al., 2014Court F. Tayama C. Romanelli V.

To examine whether these unique methylation patterns were maintained in TSCT and TSblast cells, we performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) of TSCT and TSblast cells and compared the data with those of CT cells (Hamada et al., 2016Hamada H. Okae H. Toh H. Chiba H. Hiura H. Shirane K. Sato T. Suyama M. Yaegashi N. Sasaki H. Arima T.

Nery J.R. Hon G. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. O’Malley R. Castanon R. Klugman S. et al.Hotspots of aberrant epigenomic reprogramming in human induced pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2011; 471: 68-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar), and cord blood cells (Okae et al., 2014Okae H. Chiba H. Hiura H. Hamada H. Sato A. Utsunomiya T. Kikuchi H. Yoshida H. Tanaka A. Suyama M. Arima T. Genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation dynamics during early human development.PLoS Genet. 2014; 10: e1004868Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Figure 5A). TSCT and TSblast cells showed almost identical global DNA methylation patterns (R = 0.97). Although the average methylation levels of TSCT (33.7%) and TSblast cells (33.6%) were substantially lower than that of CT cells (52.3%), their methylation patterns were similar to each other (R ≥ 0.80). Most of the PMDs defined in a previous study (Schroeder et al., 2013Schroeder D.I. Blair J.D. Lott P. Yu H.O. Hong D. Crary F. Ashwood P. Walker C. Korf I. Robinson W.P. LaSalle J.M. The human placenta methylome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) maintained the intermediate methylation levels in CT cells but were hypomethylated in TSCT and TSblast cells (Figures 5B and 5C). Actively transcribed regions showed higher methylation levels compared with other regions in CT, TSCT, and TSblast cells (Figure S5A), consistent with previous findings in the human placenta (Schroeder et al., 2013Schroeder D.I. Blair J.D. Lott P. Yu H.O. Hong D. Crary F. Ashwood P. Walker C. Korf I. Robinson W.P. LaSalle J.M. The human placenta methylome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: 6037-6042Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, the placenta-specific DNA methylome was largely maintained in TSCT and TSblast cells, although the cause and significance of the PMD hypomethylation remain unclear. We next analyzed the ELF5 promoter, which is hypomethylated in trophoblast cells but hypermethylated in many other cell types (Hemberger et al., 2010Hemberger M. Udayashankar R. Tesar P. Moore H. Burton G.J. ELF5-enforced transcriptional networks define an epigenetically regulated trophoblast stem cell compartment in the human placenta.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 2456-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We found that the ELF5 promoter was hypomethylated in both TSCT and TSblast cells (Figure 5D). In addition to the ELF5 promoter, we identified 55 promoters with methylation patterns similar to that of the ELF5 promoter (methylation level < 20% in CT cells and > 80% in ESCs and blood cells), which included some promoters that are known to be specifically hypomethylated in the placenta (e.g., the promoters of INSL4 and DSCR4) (Du et al., 2011Du Y. Zhang J. Wang H. Yan X. Yang Y. Yang L. Luo X. Chen Y. Duan T. Ma D. Hypomethylated DSCR4 is a placenta-derived epigenetic marker for trisomy 21.Prenat.

We found that most of these promoters (48 of 55) maintained less than 20% methylation levels in TSCT and TSblast cells (Figure 5E; Table S4). We confirmed the hypomethylation of three selected promoters (DSCR4, ELF5, and ZNF750) in all TSCT and TSblast lines established in this study (Figure S5B). We also identified 5 promoters with the opposite pattern, and all of them had more than 80% methylation levels in TSCT and TSblast cells (Figure 5E; Table S4). A number of placenta-specific gDMRs, which maintain allele-specific DNA methylation in a placenta-specific manner, have been identified. We focused on placenta-specific gDMRs associated with imprinted genes (n = 33) (Table S5). Most of the gDMRs maintained the expected intermediate methylation levels (30%–70%) in CT (33 of 33), TSCT (26 of 33), and TSblast cells (24 of 33) but not in ESCs (0 of 33) or blood cells (0 of 33). We analyzed allele-specific DNA methylation in two TSCT cell lines using targeted bisulfite sequencing (see STAR Methods for details). The allelic methylation patterns were successfully obtained for ten placenta-specific gDMRs, and nine of them maintained maternal allele-specific DNA methylation in TSCT cells (Figure 5F). We did not analyze the allelic DNA methylation patterns in TSblast cells because the maternal genotype was not available. However, nine of the ten gDMRs maintained i"

This provides a simple model for tissue regeneration, implicating cellular reprogramming as an essential element. Intestinal epithelial stem cells ensure fast tissue replenishment. These adult stem cells reside at the bottom of crypts and express markers such as Lgr5, Olfm4, and Lrig1 (Barker et al., 2012Barker N. van Oudenaarden A. Clevers H. Identifying the stem cell of the intestinal crypt: strategies and pitfalls.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 452-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Upon tissue damage, cells that are distinct from adult intestinal stem cells contribute to wound repair, replenishment of lost stem cells, and restoration of tissue architecture (Blanpain and Fuchs, 2014Blanpain C. Fuchs E. Stem cell plasticity. Plasticity of epithelial stem cells in tissue regeneration.Science. 2014; 344: 1242281Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Yet, the cellular responses underlying this remarkable plasticity remain unclear. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease, have impaired intestinal barrier function, and they experience recurrent severe inflammation. Current treatment strategies aim to reduce the intestinal inflammation burden in general, with only a limited focus on targeting the epithelium to promote tissue regeneration. Tissue regeneration is a complex process associated with pronounced changes to the environment at both the cellular and biophysical levels (Stappenbeck and Miyoshi, 2009Stappenbeck T.S. Miyoshi H. The role of stromal stem cells in tissue regeneration and wound repair.Science. 2009; 324: 1666-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Sensing these environmental changes and spatial information is, however, essential during tissue regeneration. Two highly related transcriptional activators, YAP and TAZ, have recently emerged as primary sensors of the cellular microenvironment, integrating cell polarity and mechanical cues with growth factor signaling and inflammation (Piccolo et al., 2014Piccolo S. Dupont S. Cordenonsi M. The biology of YAP/TAZ: hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). In vitro, activation of YAP/TAZ has recently been shown to dedifferentiate committed cells back to a progenitor and stem cell state (Panciera et al., 2016Panciera T. Azzolin L. Fujimura A. Di Biagio D. Frasson C. Bresolin S. Soligo S. Basso G. Bicciato S.

YAP/TAZ-mediated signaling appears dispensable during steady-state homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G.

The Hippo signaling pathway restricts the oncogenic potential of an intestinal regeneration program.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2383-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Evidence does, however, suggest an important role of YAP during intestinal regeneration (Cai et al., 2010Cai J. Zhang N. Zheng Y. de Wilde R.F. Maitra A. Pan D. The Hippo signaling pathway restricts the oncogenic potential of an intestinal regeneration program.Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2383-2388Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Yet, it remains largely unknown how YAP/TAZ signaling is controlled during repair and which cellular processes are regulated by YAP/TAZ during tissue remodeling. Here we examine wound repair in the colonic epithelium and identify markers for the repairing epithelium (RE). Characterization of the repairing epithelium demonstrates a strong and necessary response by the transcriptional regulators YAP/TAZ driven by environmental changes. We provide evidence that this can be recapitulated in vitro using defined cell culture conditions in a YAP/TAZ-dependent manner. Moreover, the changes associated with the repairing epithelium strongly suggest that the tissue undergoes injury-assisted transition into a primitive state with fetal-like properties. Importantly, the changes associated with the wound-induced reprogramming are reversible both in vivo and in vitro, allowing the tissue to regain its normal cellular architecture and adult-specific gene expression, when regeneration is complete. We believe that understanding the process of tissue repair and how this is orchestrated at the cellular and molecular levels will provide better solutions for enhancing regeneration. To investigate the mechanisms controlling tissue regeneration following severe injury, we took advantage of the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis model. Mice exposed to DSS for 5 days developed epithelial ulceration in the colon (Figures 1A, 1B, and S1A). Ulceration of the distal part of the colon was evident approximately 1 week after DSS administration (Figure S1A). This was followed by the formation of swelling islets (Figure 1A), which were covered by a thickened hyperplastic repairing epithelium (Figures 1B and 1C). At 1 month after the administration of DSS, tissue homeostasis was restored (Figure S1A). Members of the LY6 superfamily of cell surface proteins are upregulated during colitis (Flanagan et al., 2008Flanagan K. Modrusan Z. Cornelius J. Chavali A. Kasman I. Komuves L. Mo L. Diehl L. Intestinal epithelial cell up-regulation of LY6 molecules during colitis results in enhanced chemokine secretion.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 3874-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Moreover, the LY6 member Stem Cell Antigen-1 (Sca1/Ly6a) has been used extensively in the hematopoietic field to enrich for murine hematopoietic stem cells (Morrison et al., 1995Morrison S.J. Uchida N. Weissman I.L. The biology of hematopoietic stem cells.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 35-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether Sca1 could represent a marker for the repairing epithelium. Immunofluorescence time course analysis showed a dynamic regulation of Sca1, with initial elevated levels in the stroma and subsequently very high levels specifically associated with the swelling areas of the repairing epithelium (Figures 1D–1G and S1B). This pattern was mirrored by the secreted bactericidal C-type lectin Reg3b (Figure S1A). Further characterization of the repairing epithelium demonstrated an elevated number of proliferative cells (Ki67 positive) and fewer Muc2-expressing secretory cells than in homeostatic tissue (Figures S1C and S1D). Thus, the repairing epithelium expresses markers that distinguish it from the homeostatic epithelium, indicating that these cells have distinct properties. To gain more insights into the molecular traits of the repairing epithelium, we performed expression profiling on epithelial cells purified from homeostatic tissue (EpCAMposSca1negCD45negCD31neg) and the repairing epithelium (EpCAMposSca1highCD45negCD31neg). As expected, a number of genes were differentially expressed between these purified epithelial cell populations (424 probe sets up and 585 probe sets down; fold change > 2; false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05), reinforcing the notion that the repairing epithelium represents a cellular state profoundly different from the normal homeostatic epithelium (Figure 1H). Gene ontology (GO) analyses for molecular pathways illustrated that the Sca1high cells were specifically enriched in signaling cascades associated with chemokines and inflammation, whereas metabolic pathways were repressed (Figures S1E and S1F; Tables S1 and S2). Importantly, a number of markers specifically associated with the adult stem cell state were specifically repressed in the Sca1high state. This was evident at the protein level, where expression of the stem cell marker Lrig1 was reduced during the early phases of tissue repair (Figure 1I; Wong et al., 2012Wong V.W. Stange D.E. Page M.E. Buczacki S. Wabik A. Itami S. van de Wetering M. Poulsom R. Wright N.A. Trotter M.W. et al.Lrig1 controls intestinal stem-cell homeostasis by negative regulation of ErbB signalling.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), as well as at the RNA level, where there was a general suppression of the gene signature associated with Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells (Figure 1J; Muñoz et al., 2012Muñoz J. Stange D.E. Schepers A.G. van de Wetering M. Koo B.K. Itzkovitz S. Volckmann R. Kung K.S. Koster J. Radulescu S. et al.The Lgr5 intestinal stem cell signature: robust expression of proposed quiescent '+4′ cell markers.EMBO J. 2012; 31: 3079-3091Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Similarly, Sca1high cells were distinct from Sca1low cells following experimental colitis (Figure S1E). Despite the suppression of intestinal stem cell markers, Sca1high cells retained in vitro stem cell potential (Figure 1K). This demonstrates that the intestinal epithelium, as it progresses into the repair phase, undergoes extensive changes, including the suppression of normal markers of adult stem cell, without affecting stem cell potential. An assessment of the GO terms for biological processes associated with the repair phase revealed enrichment for transcriptional processes linked with morphogenesis and development (Figure S1F). We have previously demonstrated that the intestinal epithelium has distinct fetal and adult stem cells that can be propagated in vitro (Fordham et al., 2013Fordham R.P. Yui S. Hannan N.R. Soendergaard C. Madgwick A. Schweiger P.J. Nielsen O.H. Vallier L. Pedersen R.A. Nakamura T. et al.Transplantation of expanded fetal intestinal progenitors contributes to colon regeneration after injury.Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 13: 734-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Expression analysis of cultures derived from the fetal and adult epithelium revealed that Sca1 was transcriptionally upregulated by fetal organoids along with a number of other Ly6 family members (Figures 2A and 2B ). In vivo these observations were paralleled by the robust expression of Sca1 in the fetal colonic epithelium (Figure 2C), whereas it was absent in the adult homeostatic colonic epithelium (Figure 1D). All in all, this demonstrates that Sca1 is expressed by more primitive epithelia both in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of fetal signature genes (>2-fold; FDR < 0.05; fetal versus adult organoids) revealed a significant enrichment in the repairing epithelium when compared to the normal adult epithelium, strongly suggesting that the repairing epithelium represents an earlier developmental stage (Figure 2D). To further substantiate this observation, we assessed the expression of Annexin A1 (Anxa1), which was elevated in fetal organoids (Figures 2B and 2E), and Tacstd2/Trop2, which marks fetal progenitors (Mustata et al., 2013Mustata R.C. Vasile G. Fernandez-Vallone V. Strollo S. Lefort A. Libert F. Monteyne D. Pérez-Morga D. Vassart G. Garcia M.I. Identification of Lgr5-independent spheroid-generating progenitors of the mouse fetal intestinal epithelium.Cell Rep. 2013; 5: 421-432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Evidently, Anxa1 expression was upregulated both in the fetal and repairing epithelium (Figures 2F and S2A), and Tacstd2/Trop2 was also elevated during the repair phase and by fetal organoids (Figures S2A–S2C). These observations are consistent with the notion that, upon colonic injury, regeneration involves transcriptional reprogramming of epithelial cells to a more primitive state. We next evaluated human clinical material to address whether the observed reprogramming occurs following severe inflammation. As there is no human homolog of Sca1, we analyzed ANXA1 in intestinal specimens obtained by colonoscopy from non-inflamed areas and areas with active disease in the same patient with ulcerative colitis. Similar to our observations in mouse, ANXA1 was highly expressed in the areas of flaring disease, where the epithelium was in a state of regeneration as compared to the non-inflamed part (Figure 2G). Analyses of publicly available gene expression datasets from colonic tissue from patients with active ulcerative colitis and normal colon tissues (Van der Goten et al., 2014Van der Goten J. Vanhove W. Lemaire K. Van Lommel L. Machiels K. Wollants W.J. De Preter V. De Hertogh G. Ferrante M. Van Assche G. et al.Integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiling in inflamed colon of patients with ulcerative colitis.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e116117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) further substantiated this finding, as genes upregulated by the repairing epithelium (>2-fold; FDR < 0.05; mRepair) and the fetal gene signatures (mFetal; Figures 2H and 2I; Table S3) were enriched in tissue from ulcerative colitis patients. We conclude that extensive transcriptional rewiring occurs upon regeneration in human ulcerative colitis and following DSS-induced colitis in mouse models. To investigate the molecular mechanism for the observed cellular reprogramming, we turned to the transcriptional profiles associated with the repairing epithelium, where we observed a profound repression of genes associated with secretory lineage. In contrast, several extracellular matrix components, including collagen type I, were highly elevated in the repairing epithelium (Figures 3A and S3A). This was also evident from GO analyses, where integrin signaling was among the most enriched pathways in the Sca1high population (Figure S1F). These gene responses correlated well with the pronounced changes in the wound bed, as detected by second harmonic generation microscopy, where collagen fibers accumulated around de novo-formed crypts (Figure 3B). Changes in the signaling between the extracellular matrix (ECM) and epithelial cells are sensed by transmembrane collagen receptors of the integrin family, activating focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src to control actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (Kim and Gumbiner, 2015Kim N.G. Gumbiner B.M. Adhesion to fibronectin regulates Hippo signaling via the FAK-Src-PI3K pathway.J. Cell Biol. 2015; 210: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). In line with the exposure to the wound-associated matrix, the repairing epithelium displayed elevated levels of the collagen receptor β1 integrin subunit and FAK at the basolateral cell surface, as well as enhanced levels of phosphorylated Src (pSrc) and loss of polarized F-actin filaments (Figures 3C and S3B). This reveals that the repairing epithelium is influenced by the altered environmental stimuli and mechanical properties of the dense collagen matrix present in the wound bed. YAP and TAZ are overarching mechano-transducers and key transcriptional regulators of cell fates (Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. et al.Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction.Nature. 2011; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar). In line with the altered accumulation and activation of components of the focal adhesion pathway, the number of cells with nuclear accumulation of YAP was highly elevated during the repair phase, when compared to the small subsets of positive cells in the normal epithelium (Figures 3D and S3C). Moreover, GSEA with a reported YAP/TAZ activity gene signature showed a highly significant enrichment in the repairing epithelium (Figure 3E; Gregorieff et al., 2015Gregorieff A. Liu Y. Inanlou M.R. Khomchuk Y. Wrana J.L. Yap-dependent reprogramming of Lgr5(+) stem cells drives intestinal regeneration and cancer.Nature. 2015; 526: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The combination of YAP nuclear retention and YAP/TAZ transcriptional activation provides strong evidence that YAP/TAZ-mediated signaling is activated during tissue regeneration. To test whether signaling downstream of integrins is important for tissue repair and the localization of the mechano-sensor YAP, animals were treated with FAK and Src inhibitors during the transition from ulceration to the repair phase. We found that the activation of both pathway components was important for tissue repair, as mice treated with the inhibitors showed delayed repair following injury in line with previous reports (Cordero et al., 2014Cordero J.B. Ridgway R.A. Valeri N. Nixon C. Frame M.C. Muller W.J. Vidal M. Sansom O.J. c-Src drives intestinal regeneration and transformation.EMBO J. 2014; 33: 1474-1491PubMed Google Scholar, Owen et al., 2011Owen K.A. Abshire M.Y. Tilghman R.W. Casanova J.E. Bouton A.H. FAK regulates intestinal epithelial cell survival and proliferation during mucosal wound healing.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e23123Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar; Figure 3F). Moreover, large ulcerative regions remained in animals treated with both inhibitors (Figures S3D–S3G), and the remaining epithelium had very few cells with nuclear YAP and signs of active tissue remodeling (Figures 3G and S3H). This demonstrates that cell mechanics via the FAK pathway is important for colonic repair and the establishment of the highly proliferative repairing epithelium. Based on the pronounced remodeling of the extracellular matrix during the repair phase, we hypothesized that these environmental changes have inductive properties. To test this, we took advantage of a 3D culture system for the adult small intestine (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Single Lgr5 stem cells build crypt-villus structures in vitro without a mesenchymal niche.Nature. 2009; 459: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (4122) Google Scholar). Unlike primary cells from the colon, small intestinal epithelial cells can be cultured as organoids under minimal conditions in the presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), Noggin, and R-spondin1 (Sato et al., 2009Sato T. Vries R.G. Snippert H.J. van de Wetering M. Barker N. Stange D.E. van Es J.H. Abo A. Kujala P. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

Ferrante M. Vries R.G. Van Es J.H. Van den Brink S. Van Houdt W.J. Pronk A. Van Gorp J. Siersema P.D. Clevers H.

These organoids are typically cultured in Matrigel, consisting primarily of laminins and collagen IV. Collagen type I was prominently upregulated during the repair phase (Figures 3B and S3A), but gels consisting of pure collagen type I did not support cultures of intestinal epithelial cells in medium supplemented with EGF, Noggin, and R-spondin1, whereas a combination of collagen type I and Matrigel did (Figures 4A and S4A). This suggests that collagen type I itself was not prohibiting expansion of small intestinal epithelial organoids and that additional factors should be incorporated to phenocopy the inductive microenvironment for the repairing epithelium. Recent evidence with artificially designed matrices indicates that conditions that sustain YAP activation can maintain primary epithelial cells in vitro (Gjorevski et al., 2016Gjorevski N. Sachs N. Manfrin A. Giger S. Bragina M.E. Ordóñez-Morán P. Clevers H. Lutolf M.P. Designer matrices for intestinal stem cell and organoid culture.Nature. 2016; 539: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (768) Google Scholar). Augmentation of canonical Wnt signaling has been connected to efficient tissue repair, and canonical Wnt factors cooperate with cell mechanics to sustain YAP/TAZ activation in normal and cancer cells (Azzolin et al., 2012Azzolin L. Zanconato F. Bresolin S. Forcato M. Basso G. Bicciato S. Cordenonsi M. Piccolo S.

This prompted us to investigate whether the combined stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway together with collagen type I could install an repairing epithelium-like phenotype in vitro. Strikingly, we found that this combination supported the in vitro expansion of epithelial cells as spheroids for multiple passages in a transcriptionally distinct state (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4A). It was recently suggested that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) acts via the activation of YAP in vivo (Kim et al., 2017Kim H.B. Kim M. Park Y.S. Park I. Kim T. Yang S.Y. Cho C.J. Hwang D. Jung J.H. Markowitz S.D. et al.Prostaglandin E2 Activates YAP and a Positive-Signaling Loop to Promote Colon Regeneration After Colitis but Also Carcinogenesis in Mice.Gastroenterology. 2017; 152: 616-630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar); however, PGE2 cannot replace Wnt3a nor is the activity of the critical enzymes responsible for PGE2 production, Cox1 and Cox2, required for maintenance in collagen (Figure S4A). Importantly, the addition of Wnt3a to standard Matrigel cultures also promoted a spherical phenotype, but with occasional budding domains (Figures 4A and S4A). Under collagen conditions, analogously to the in vivo colitis samples, the apical F-actin belt was lost and YAP was retained in the nuclei (Figures 4C and S4B). At the molecular level, stem cell (Lgr5, Olfm4, and Ascl2) and differentiation markers (Lyz1, Muc2, ChgA, Def6a, Lct, and Atoh1) were repressed, whereas the YAP/TAZ target genes (Ctgf, Ankrd1, Ereg, and Cyr61) as well as reprogramming marker Ly6a were induced (Figure 4D). Moreover, the epithelium started to express both Sca1 and Anxa1 (Figure 4E). Sca1 expression was retained after spheroid passaging, indicating that the Wnt/collagen condition installed a stable cellular state that recapitulated the cellular response during tissue repair. Transcriptional analysis confirmed that cells cultured under these conditions in vitro were remarkably similar to the gene profiles of the repairing epithelium in vivo (Figure 4F), including a prominent activation of YAP and fetal gene signatures (Figure 4G) and suppression of the Lgr5 stem cell signature (Figure S4C). Moreover, the conditions could be applied to both mouse and human colonic epithelial cells (Figure 4H), where overt transcriptional overlaps could be detected between adult colonic organoids cultured in collagen type I and fetal colonic organoids (Figure S4D). Importantly, inhibitors affecting signaling downstream of integrins via Rho kinase (C3 toxin; Mevastatin) and actin polymerization (Cytochalasin D) all significantly reduced growth in collagen type I (Figure S4E; Dupont et al., 2011Dupont S. Morsut L. Aragona M. Enzo E. Giulitti S. Cordenonsi M. Zanconato F. Le Digabel J. Forcato M. Bicciato S. et al.Role of YAP/TAZ in mechanotransduction.Nature. 2011; 474: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3273) Google Scholar, Sorrentino et al., 2014Sorrentino G. Ruggeri N. Specchia V. Cordenonsi M. Mano M. Dupont S. Manfrin A. Ingallina E. Sommaggio R. Piazza S. et al.Metabolic control of YAP and TAZ by the mevalonate pathway.Nat. Cell Biol. 2014; 16: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Similarly, the FAK and Src inhibitors that affected tissue repair in vivo (Figure 3F) reduced growth in collagen type I (Figure S4E). This demonstrates the importance of matrix-mediated integrin signaling, and it suggests that mechano-transduction via YAP/TAZ is important for growth in collagen type I. The above experiments suggest that YAP/TAZ act downstream of cell mechanics and Wnt signaling in cells of the repairing epithelium. Wnt signaling has previously been demonstrated to stimulate YAP/TAZ activation via the inhibition of Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (Apc)-mediated degradation (Azzolin et al., 2012Azzolin L. Zanconato F. Bresolin S. Forcato M. Basso G. Bicciato S. Cordenonsi M. Piccolo S. Role of TAZ as mediator of Wnt signaling.Cell. 2012; 151: 1443-1456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G.

As expected, in collagen cultures Wnt3a could be substituted by the loss of Apc (Figures 5A and 5B ). Moreover, ApcKO organoid growth could be blocked by treatment with the YAP/TAZ inhibitor verteporfin (Figure 5C). This demonstrates that Wnt via inhibition of the Apc complex supports growth in collagen type I via YAP/TAZ activation. This is similar to the reported requirement for YAP/TAZ during tumor formation upon the loss of Apc (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G. Guzzardo V. et al.YAP/TAZ incorporation in the β-catenin destruction complex orchestrates the Wnt response.Cell. 2014; 158: 157-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Notably, blunting YAP/TAZ mechano-transduction by the inhibition of Rho signaling also opposed the growth of ApcKO organoids, a result consistent with the requirement of cell mechanics for YAP/TAZ activation in the repairing epithelium in vivo (Figure 5C). Importantly, even in the ApcKO model, cell mechanics were still causal for sustaining YAP/TAZ target genes (Cyr61 and Ctgf) and the associated appearance of markers associated with the fetal epithelium (Tacstd2 and Ly6a). This suggests that in our ex vivo-culturing conditions, activation of Wnt signaling and cell mechanics are additive signals for YAP/TAZ activation, but that cell mechanics remain essential for Wnt-induced YAP/TAZ activity. To directly assess the requirements for YAP/TAZ in the context of collagen-induced cellular reprogramming, we took advantage of both loss- and gain-of-function mutants. Using an inducible conditional double-knockout (cDKO) model for YAP/TAZ (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G.

https://openalex.org/W2781383440,"A selective small-molecule degrader of CDK9 was generated by conjugating an imide to SNS-032, a promiscuous ATP-site-directed CDK binder. The pharmacological consequences of CDK9 degradation versus inhibition were compared. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), an important regulator of transcriptional elongation, is a promising target for cancer therapy, particularly for cancers driven by transcriptional dysregulation. We characterized NVP-2, a selective ATP-competitive CDK9 inhibitor, and THAL-SNS-032, a selective CDK9 degrader consisting of a CDK-binding SNS-032 ligand linked to a thalidomide derivative that binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase Cereblon (CRBN). To our surprise, THAL-SNS-032 induced rapid degradation of CDK9 without affecting the levels of other SNS-032 targets. Moreover, the transcriptional changes elicited by THAL-SNS-032 were more like those caused by NVP-2 than those induced by SNS-032. Notably, compound washout did not significantly reduce levels of THAL-SNS-032-induced apoptosis, suggesting that CDK9 degradation had prolonged cytotoxic effects compared with CDK9 inhibition. Thus, our findings suggest that thalidomide conjugation represents a promising strategy for converting multi-targeted inhibitors into selective degraders and reveal that kinase degradation can induce distinct pharmacological effects compared with inhibition."

https://openalex.org/W2781417302,"Combinatorial genetic screening using CRISPR-Cas9 is a useful approach to uncover redundant genes and to explore complex gene networks. However, current methods suffer from interference between the single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and from limited gene targeting activity. To increase the efficiency of combinatorial screening, we employ orthogonal Cas9 enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. We used machine learning to establish S. aureus Cas9 sgRNA design rules and paired S. aureus Cas9 with S. pyogenes Cas9 to achieve dual targeting in a high fraction of cells. We also developed a lentiviral vector and cloning strategy to generate high-complexity pooled dual-knockout libraries to identify synthetic lethal and buffering gene pairs across multiple cell types, including MAPK pathway genes and apoptotic genes. Our orthologous approach also enabled a screen combining gene knockouts with transcriptional activation, which revealed genetic interactions with TP53. The ""Big Papi"" (paired aureus and pyogenes for interactions) approach described here will be widely applicable for the study of combinatorial phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2777399253,"Vertebrate glycoproteins and glycolipids are synthesized in complex biosynthetic pathways localized predominantly within membrane compartments of the secretory pathway. The enzymes that catalyze these reactions are exquisitely specific, yet few have been extensively characterized because of challenges associated with their recombinant expression as functional products. We used a modular approach to create an expression vector library encoding all known human glycosyltransferases, glycoside hydrolases, and sulfotransferases, as well as other glycan-modifying enzymes. We then expressed the enzymes as secreted catalytic domain fusion proteins in mammalian and insect cell hosts, purified and characterized a subset of the enzymes, and determined the structure of one enzyme, the sialyltransferase ST6GalNAcII. Many enzymes were produced at high yields and at similar levels in both hosts, but individual protein expression levels varied widely. This expression vector library will be a transformative resource for recombinant enzyme production, broadly enabling structure-function studies and expanding applications of these enzymes in glycochemistry and glycobiology."
https://openalex.org/W2778452486,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acts as a signaling messenger by triggering the reversible oxidation of redox-regulated proteins. It remains unclear how proteins can be oxidized by signaling levels of H2O2 in the presence of peroxiredoxins, which are highly efficient peroxide scavengers. Here we show that the rapid formation of disulfide bonds in cytosolic proteins is enabled, rather than competed, by cytosolic 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. Under the conditions tested, the combined deletion or depletion of cytosolic peroxiredoxins broadly frustrated H2O2-dependent protein thiol oxidation, which is the exact opposite of what would be predicted based on the assumption that H2O2 oxidizes proteins directly. We find that peroxiredoxins enable rapid and sensitive protein thiol oxidation by relaying H2O2-derived oxidizing equivalents to other proteins. Although these findings do not rule out the existence of Prx-independent H2O2 signaling mechanisms, they suggest a broader role for peroxiredoxins as sensors and transmitters of H2O2 signals than hitherto recognized."

Methods Prospective longitudinal study of 10,000 school children aged 5 to 15 years screened after an interval of 1 year to identify new myopes (Spherical Equivalent≤ -0.5D) and progression of myopia in previously diagnosed myopic children. Association between risk factors and progression was analyzed using adjusted odds ratio. Results Of the 9,616 children re-screened (97.3% coverage), annual incidence of myopia was 3.4%with mean dioptric change of -1.09 ± 0.55. There was a significant higher incidence of myopia in younger children compared to older children (P = 0.012) and among girls compared to boys (P = 0.002). Progression was observed in 49.2%children with mean dioptric change of -0.27 ± 0.42 diopters. The demographic and behavioral risk factors were analyzed for children with progression (n = 629) and adjusted odds ratio values were estimated. Hours of reading-writing/week (p<0.001), use of computers/ video games (P<0.001) and watching television (P = 0.048) were significant risk factors for progression of myopia. Outdoor activities / time spent outdoors> 2 hours in a day were protective with an inverse association with progression of myopia (P< 0.001). Conclusion Myopia is an important health issue in India and is associated with long hours of reading and screen time with use of computers and video games. An annual eye vision screening should be conducted, and outdoor activities be promoted to prevent the increase of myopia among school children."

https://openalex.org/W2771380961,"The clonal complexity of adult stem cell pools is progressively lost during homeostatic turnover in several tissues, suggesting a decrease in the number of stem cells with distinct clonal origins. The functional impact of reduced complexity on stem cell pools, and how different tissue microenvironments may contribute to such a reduction, are poorly understood. Here, we performed clonal multicolor lineage tracing of skeletal muscle stem cells (MuSCs) to address these questions. We found that MuSC clonal complexity is maintained during aging despite heterogenous reductions in proliferative capacity, allowing aged muscle to mount a clonally diverse, albeit diminished, response to injury. In contrast, repeated bouts of tissue repair cause a progressive reduction in MuSC clonal complexity indicative of neutral drift. Consistently, biostatistical modeling suggests that MuSCs undergo symmetric expansions with stochastic fate acquisition during tissue repair. These findings establish distinct principles that underlie stem cell dynamics during homeostatic aging and muscle regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2771110788,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has high rates of local recurrence and distant metastasis, partially due to its high invasiveness. The Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) transcription factor has been shown to be specifically overexpressed in TNBC and associated with poor clinical outcome. How TNBC’s high invasiveness is driven by FOXC1 and its downstream targets remains poorly understood. In the present study, pathway-specific PCR array assays revealed that WNT5A and matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) were upregulated by FOXC1 in TNBC cells. Interestingly, WNT5A mediates the upregulation of MMP7 by FOXC1 and the WNT5A-MMP7 axis is essential for FOXC1-induced invasiveness of TNBC cells in vitro. Xenograft models showed that the lung extravasation and metastasis of FOXC1-overexpressing TNBC cells were attenuated by knocking out WNT5A, but could be restored by MMP7 overexpression. Mechanistically, FOXC1 can bind directly to the WNT5A promoter region to activate its expression. Engineered DNA-binding molecule-mediated chromatin immunoprecipitation (enChIP), coupled with mass spectrometry, identified FOXC1-interacting proteins including a group of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins involved in WNT5A transcription induction. Finally, we found that WNT5A activates NF-κB signaling to induce MMP7 expression. Collectively, these data demonstrate a FOXC1-elicited non-canonical WNT5A signaling mechanism comprising NF-κB and MMP7 that is essential for TNBC cell invasiveness, thereby providing implications toward developing an effective therapy for TNBC."
https://openalex.org/W2774649052,"In order to better understand the process of breast cancer metastasis, we have generated a mammary epithelial progression series of increasingly aggressive cell lines that metastasize to lung. Here we demonstrate that upregulation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking gene signature in metastatic cells enhances transport kinetics, which promotes malignant progression. We observe increased ER–Golgi trafficking, an altered secretome and sensitivity to the retrograde transport inhibitor brefeldin A (BFA) in cells that metastasize to lung. CREB3 was identified as a transcriptional regulator of upregulated ER–Golgi trafficking genes ARF4, COPB1, and USO1, and silencing of these genes attenuated the metastatic phenotype in vitro and lung colonization in vivo. Furthermore, high trafficking gene expression significantly correlated with increased risk of distant metastasis and reduced relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients, suggesting that modulation of ER–Golgi trafficking plays an important role in metastatic progression."
https://openalex.org/W2776400457,"Objective To estimate the phenotypic characterization of fibrotic process in adenomyosis occurring at the inner or the outer myometrium. Methods Eight cases of adenomyosis occurring at the inner myometrium (Subtype I) and 10 cases of adenomyosis occurring at the outer myometrium (Subtype II), and 10 normal counterparts were used in this study. A immunohistochemical study for smooth muscle cells (SMCs) was performed using cytoskeletal proteins, Type I and III collagen, TGF-β and its signaling molecules. Results An increased expression of Type I collagen was observed in the extracellular matrix of adenomyotic foci. In normal uteri, immunostaining of SMC differentiation marker proteins (Desmin, Smoothelin, Myosin heavy chain (MHC)) were absent or only found in low numbers at the inner myometrium, while all of these marker proteins were clearly stained at the outer myometrium. In both types of adenomyotic foci, Desmin, Smoothelin, and MHC commonly showed a negative staining at the adjacent area to the glands. A significant staining of Non-muscle myosin IIB, TGF-β, and phosphorylated TGF-β type I receptors were found only at the SMCs of Subtype II adenomyosis. The Smad3/2 ratio of Subtype II adenomyosis was significantly higher than that of Subtype I. Conclusions The inner myometrium of normal uteri was composed of undifferentiated phenotypes of SMCs, while the outer myometrium was composed of terminally differentiated SMCs. Various fibrotic processes have been suggested in the development of uterine adenomyosis. Distinct expression patterns of fibrosis related proteins have been shown to be implicated with differences in the subtypes of adenomyosis."
https://openalex.org/W2778755841,"There is an urgent need for new insecticides for indoor residual spraying (IRS) which can provide improved and prolonged control of malaria vectors that have developed resistance to existing insecticides. The neonicotinoid, clothianidin represents a class of chemistry new to public health. Clothianidin acts as an agonist on nicotinic acetyl choline receptors. IRS with a mixture of Clothianidin and another WHO approved insecticide such as deltamethrin could provide improved control of insecticide resistant malaria vector populations and serve as a tool for insecticide resistance management.The efficacy and residual activity of a novel IRS mixture of deltamethrin and clothianidin was evaluated against wild pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae sl in experimental huts in Cove, Benin. Two application rates of the mixture were tested and comparison was made with clothianidin and deltamethrin applied alone. To assess the residual efficacy of the treatments on different local wall substrates, the inner walls of the experimental huts were covered with either cement, mud or plywood.Clothianidin demonstrated a clear delayed expression in mortality of wild pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae sl in the experimental huts which reached its full effect 120 hours after exposure. Overall mortality over the 12-month hut trial was 15% in the control hut and 24-29% in the deltamethrin-treated huts. The mixture of clothianidin 200mg/m2 and deltamethrin 25mg/m2 induced high overall hut mortality rates (87% on mud walls, 82% on cement walls and 61% on wooden walls) largely due to the clothianidin component and high hut exiting rates (67-76%) mostly due to the deltamethrin component. Mortality rates remained >80% for 8-9 months on mud and cement walls. The residual activity trend was confirmed by results from monthly in situ cone bioassays with laboratory susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu strain.IRS campaigns with the mixture of clothianidin plus deltamethrin have the potential to provide prolonged control of malaria transmitted by pyrethroid resistant mosquito populations."

However, their roles in maintaining paracellular permeability as leaky epithelia have yet to be defined.To investigate the contributory role of TJ proteins in the leaky proximal tubule, we xamined the effect of inhibiting claudin-2, occludin, and ZO-1 expression on transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular permeability using the immortalized human proximal tubule epithelial cell line HK-2. For this, small-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against claudin-2, occludin and ZO-1 were transfected into HK-2 cells. TER and transepithelial flux rates of dextrans (4 and 70 kDa) were determined after 24 h.Transfection of siRNAs (25 nM) knocked down TJ protein expression. Control HK-2 monolayers achieved a steady-state TER of 6-8 Ω·cm2 when grown in 12-well Transwell filters, which are compatible with leaky epithelia. Knockdown of claudin-2 decreased in TER and increased occludin expression. Transfection with siRNA against either occludin or ZO-1 increased TER and decreased claudin-2 expression. TER was decreased by co-inhibition of claudin-2 and ZO-1 but increased by co-inhibition of claudin-2 and occludin. TER was suppressed when claudin-2, occludin, and ZO-1 were all inhibited. Dextran flux rate was increased by claudin-2, occludin, or ZO-1 siRNA transfection. Increased dextran flux was enhanced by co-transfection of claudin-2, ZO-1, and occludin siRNA.The depletion of claudin-2, occludin and ZO-1 in HK-2 cells had differential effects on TER and macromolecule flux. We demonstrated that integration of claudin-2, occludin and ZO-1 is necessary for maintaining the function of the proximal tubular epithelium."

We performed a pilot cross sectional study to assess the feasibility of gas-capillary column ion mobility spectrometer (GC-IMS), for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in exhaled breath to diagnose bacterial RTI in hospital inpatients. Methods 71 patients were prospectively recruited from the Acute Medical Unit of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital between March and May 2016 and classified as confirmed or probable bacterial or viral RTI on the basis of microbiologic, biochemical and radiologic testing. Breath samples were collected at the patient’s bedside directly into the electronic nose device, which recorded a VOC spectrum for each sample. Sparse principal component analysis and sparse logistic regression were used to develop a diagnostic model to classify VOC spectra as being caused by bacterial or non-bacterial RTI. Results Summary area under the receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI 0.61–0.86), summary sensitivity and specificity were 62% (95% CI 41–80%) and 80% (95% CI 64–91%) respectively (p = 0.00147).

The mosquito control is still mainly performed by using insecticides but their effectiveness is increasingly questioned nowadays. We here conducted a study on Ae. aegypti resistance development towards several commonly used insecticides in the capital city of Jakarta, Indonesia. In order to achieve this goal, Ae. aegypti eggs from Jakarta were collected with ovitraps and hatched in the insectary of the Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia. The F0 generations were used for WHO resistance tests and knockdown resistance (kdr) assays. Presented results clearly showed that there was resistance development of Ae. aegypti populations to the here tested pyrethroid insecticides (i. e. permethrin). Observed mortalities were less than 90% with highest resistance against 0.75% permethrin concentrations. Furthermore, a significant association of V1016G gene mutations with resistance phenotypes to 0.75% permethrin was observed. Nevertheless, the F1534C mutation did not show a significant correlation to resistance development. In conclusion, our results show that populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes within the city of Jakarta have developed resistance against several routinely used pyrethroid insecticides in local performed control programs. Thus, the regular verification/assessment of resistance development status will hopefully help in the future to assist local public health authorities in their mosquito control programs by recommending and managing the rotation of different routinely used insecticides with diverse effector mechanisms in order to delay Ae. aegypti resistance development."

Besides reducing weight and improving obesity related comorbidities such as diabetes, bariatric surgery could improve patients’ health-related quality of life. However, the frequently used instrument to measure quality of life, the EQ-5D has not been validated for use in bariatric surgery, which is a major limitation to its use in this clinical context. Our study undertook a psychometric validation of the 5 level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) using clinical trial data to measure health-related quality of life in patients with severe and complex obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Health-related quality of life was assessed at baseline (before randomisation) and six months later in 189 patients in a randomised controlled trial of bariatric surgery. Patients completed two generic health-related quality of life instruments, the EQ-5D-5L and SF-12, which were used together for the validation using data from all patients in the trial as the trial is ongoing. Psychometric analyses included construct and criterion validity and responsiveness to change. Of the 189 validation patients, 141 (75%) were female, the median age was 49 years old (range 23–70 years) and body mass index ranged from 33–70 kg/m2. For construct validity, there were significant improvements in the distribution of responses in all EQ-5D dimensions between baseline and 6 months after randomisation. For criterion validity, the highest degree of correlation was between the EQ-5D pain/discomfort and SF-12 bodily pain domain. For responsiveness the EQ-5D and SF-12 showed statistically significant improvements in health-related quality of life between baseline and 6 months after randomisation. The EQ-5D-5L is a valid generic measure for measuring health-related quality of life in bariatric surgery patients."

Surgical and anatomical education in this field is limited by the lack of validated training models in terms of geometric and mechanical accuracy. We choose to evaluate several consumer-grade materials to create a patient-specific 3D-printed skull base model for anatomical learning and surgical training. Methods Four 3D-printed consumer-grade materials were compared to human cadaver bone: calcium sulfate hemihydrate (named Multicolor), polyamide, resin and polycarbonate. We compared the geometric accuracy, forces required to break thin walls of materials and forces required during drilling. Results All materials had an acceptable global geometric accuracy (from 0.083mm to 0.203mm of global error). Local accuracy was better in polycarbonate (0.09mm) and polyamide (0.15mm) than in Multicolor (0.90mm) and resin (0.86mm). Resin and polyamide thin walls were not broken at 200N. Forces needed to break Multicolor thin walls were 1.6–3.5 times higher than in bone. For polycarbonate, forces applied were 1.6–2.5 times higher. Polycarbonate had a mode of fracture similar to the cadaver bone. Forces applied on materials during drilling followed a normal distribution except for the polyamide which was melted. Energy spent during drilling was respectively 1.6 and 2.6 times higher on bone than on PC and Multicolor. Conclusion Polycarbonate is a good substitute of human cadaver bone for skull base surgery simulation. Thanks to short lead times and reasonable production costs, patient-specific 3D printed models can be used in clinical practice for pre-operative training, improving patient safety."
https://openalex.org/W2776293860,"An acute bout of exercise imposes a major challenge on whole-body metabolism and metabolic adjustments are needed in multiple tissues during recovery to reestablish metabolic homeostasis. It is currently unresolved how this regulation is orchestrated between tissues. This study was undertaken to clarify the role of skeletal muscle derived interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the coordination of the metabolic responses during recovery from acute exercise. Skeletal muscle specific IL-6 knockout (IL-6 MKO) and littermate Control mice were rested or ran on a treadmill for 2h. Plasma, skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue were obtained after 6 and 10h of recovery. Non-exercised IL-6 MKO mice had higher plasma lactate and lower plasma non-esterified fatty acids than Controls. The activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase in the active form was, in skeletal muscle, higher in IL-6 MKO mice than Controls in non-exercised mice and 6h after exercise. IL-6 MKO mice had lower glucose transporter 4 protein content in inguinal adipose tissue (WAT) than Control in non-exercised mice and 10h after treadmill running. Epididymal WAT hormone sensitive lipase phosphorylation and inguinal WAT mitogen activated kinase P38 phosphorylation were higher in IL-6 MKO than Control mice 6h after exercise. These findings indicate that skeletal muscle IL-6 may play an important role in the regulation of substrate utilization in skeletal muscle, basal and exercise-induced adaptations in adipose tissue glucose uptake and lipolysis during recovery from exercise. Together this indicates that skeletal muscle IL-6 contributes to reestablishing metabolic homeostasis during recovery from exercise by regulating WAT and skeletal muscle metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2779364233,"Background Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to reduce HIV-related morbidity and mortality amongst those living with HIV and reduce transmission of the virus to those who are yet to be infected. However, these outcomes depend on maximum ART adherence, and HIV programs around the world make efforts to ensure optimal adherence. Predictors of ART non-adherence vary considerably across populations and settings with respect to demographic, psychological, behavioral and economic factors. The objective of this study is to investigate risk factors that predict non-adherence to antiretroviral treatment among HIV-infected individuals in northern Tanzania. Methods At Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), a tertiary and referral hospital in northern Tanzania, we used an existing ART database to randomly select HIV-infected patients above 18 years of age who have been on triple ART for at least two years. We used interviewer administered structured questionnaires to cross-sectionally determine predictors of ART non-adherence. We determined non-adherence through retrospective review of pharmacy drug refill (PDR) records of the interviewed participants using a pharmacy database. Results Non-adherence was defined as collecting less than 95% of expected monthly refills in the previous 2 years. Multivariable logistic regression model was used to determine the predictors of non-adherence. Of the 256 patients enrolled mean age was 44 years (SD ± 11) and median CD4 count was 499 cells per microliter (IQR 332–690). Median PDR adherence was 71% (IQR 58%–75%). Non-adherence was associated with younger age and unemployment. Conclusion In this setting, adherence strategies could be adapted to address issues facing young adults, and those with household challenges such as unemployment. Further research is required to better understand the potential roles of these factors in suboptimal adherence."

Hawai‘i, particularly east Hawai‘i Island, is the epicenter for angiostrongyliasis in the USA. Rats (Rattus spp.) are the definitive hosts while gastropods are intermediate hosts. The main objective of this study was to collect adult A. cantonensis from wild rats to isolate protein for the development of a blood-based diagnostic, in the process we evaluated the prevalence of infection in wild rats. A total of 545 wild rats were sampled from multiple sites in the South Hilo District of east Hawai‘i Island. Adult male and female A. cantonensis (3,148) were collected from the hearts and lungs of humanely euthanized Rattus rattus, and R. exulans. Photomicrography and documentation of multiple stages of this parasitic nematode in situ were recorded. A total of 45.5% (197/433) of rats inspected had lung lobe(s) (mostly upper right) which appeared granular indicating this lobe may serve as a filter for worm passage to the rest of the lung. Across Rattus spp., 72.7% (396/545) were infected with adult worms, but 93.9% (512/545) of the rats were positive for A. cantonensis infection based on presence of live adult worms, encysted adult worms, L3 larvae and/or by PCR analysis of brain tissue. In R. rattus we observed an inverse correlation with increased body mass and infection level of adult worms, and a direct correlation between body mass and encysted adult worms in the lung tissue, indicating that larger (older) rats may have developed a means of clearing infections or regulating the worm burden upon reinfection. The exceptionally high prevalence of A. cantonensis infection in Rattus spp. in east Hawai‘i Island is cause for concern and indicates the potential for human infection with this emerging zoonosis is greater than previously thought."

The 20-item revised Driving Anger Scale (DAS) was used to assess a sample of 232 drivers (57% professional, 43% non-professional). The non-professional drivers reported significantly higher levels of anger than the professional drivers on the overall Driving Anger Scale (DAS) and the traffic obstructions and discourtesy subscales. In both groups, the preferred driving speeds were positively related to driving anger. Furthermore, drivers with a type A personality exhibited higher overall driving anger scores and higher anger scores in response to traffic obstructions and slow driving than drivers with a type B personality. Trait anger was significantly related to driving anger in both groups. In the non-professional group, type A behavior patterns (TABPs) and time hurry (TH) were positively correlated with anger evoked by slow driving. In the professional group, TABPs, TH and competitive hostility (CH) were positively related to driving anger, and the TABPs exerted an indirect effect on driving anger by mediating the influence of trait anger. Overall, these findings provide a theoretical basis for implementing targeted interventions for driving anger in both professional and non-professional drivers."

Such d-Asp-containing proteins are unlikely to be broken down completely because metabolic enzymes recognize only proteins or peptides composed exclusively of l-amino acids. Therefore, undigested d-Asp-containing peptides may exist in blood and, if detectable, may be a useful biomarker for associated diseases. In this study, we investigated d-amino acid-containing peptides in adult human serum by a qualitative d-amino acid analysis based on a diastereomer method and LC-MS/MS method. As a result, two d-Asp-containing peptides were detected in serum, both derived from the fibrinogen β-chain, a glycoprotein that helps in the formation of blood clots. One of the peptides was fibrinopeptide B, which prevents fibrinogen from forming polymers of fibrin, and the other was same peptide with C-terminal Arginine missing. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the presence of d-amino acid-containing peptides in serum and the approach described will provide a new direction on the serum proteome and fragmentome."

Simultaneously, the levels of the corresponding validated miRNAs within the complex containing nEGFR and mRNAs were decreased. This finding argues that an mRNA/miRNA/nEGFR complex regulates protein expression. Indeed, we detected the GW182, AGO2, PABPC1 and cNOT1 proteins, which belong to the deadenylase complex, in a complex with nuclear EGFR. Erlotinib-mediated inhibition of EGFR kinase reduced the radiation-induced increase in mRNA expression. In this context, erlotinib reduced AGO2 phosphorylation by the EGFR kinase at residue Y393, which was associated with increased cNOT1 deadenylase activity and reduced mRNA stability. To prove the roles of miRNAs in this context, we transfected cells with an inhibitor of Hsa-mir-1180p5, which targets the NFATC4 mRNA, an mRNA associated with VEGF signaling, or pretreated cells with erlotinib. Indeed, Hsa-mir-1180p5 knockdown increased and the erlotinib treatment decreased the expression of the NFATC4 protein. The expression of the NFATC4 protein controlled the cloning efficiency and radiosensitivity of A549 and FaDu tumor cells. Thus, this study is the first to show that a membrane-located tyrosine kinase receptor, such as EGFR, is internalized to a nuclear/perinuclear location upon exposure to stress and modulates the stability and translation of miRNA-selected mRNAs. This mechanism enables cells to directly express proteins in response to EGFR activation and may contribute to treatment resistance in EGFR-overexpressing tumors."

https://openalex.org/W2776063938,"Background How short-term blood pressure variability (BPV) is affected in the acute stage of ischemic stroke and whether BPV is associated with early neurologic outcomes remains unclear. Methods Patients who admitted for ischemic stroke within 24 h of symptom onset were consecutively identified between January 2010 and January 2015. BP profiles measured in real-time were summarized into short-term, 24-h time intervals, based on standard deviation (SD) and mean of systolic BP (SBPSD) during the first 3 days. The primary outcome was daily assessment of early neurological deterioration (END). The associations between short-term SBPSD values and the secular trend for primary outcome were examined. Results A total of 2,545 subjects (mean age, 67.1 ± 13.5 years old and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 3) arrived at the hospital an average of 6.1 ± 6.6 h after symptom onset. SBPSD values at day 1 (SD#D1), SD#D2, and SD#D3 were 14.4 ± 5.0, 12.5 ± 4.5, and 12.2 ± 4.6 mmHg, respectively. Multivariable analyses showed that SD#D2 was independently associated with onset of END at day 2 (adjusted odds ratio, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.13), and SD#D3 was independently associated with END#D3 (1.07, 1.01–1.14), with adjustments for predetermined covariates, SBPmean, and interactions with daily SBPSD. Conclusion Short-term BPV changed and stabilized from the first day of ischemic stroke. Daily high BPV may be associated with neurological deterioration independent of BPV on the previous day."
https://openalex.org/W2776120560,"To investigate the effects of different nutrient management regimes on the soil chemical, eco-enzymatic stoichiometric and microbial characteristics, soil samples were collected from a 30-year, long-term field experiment with six plots growing rice. The results showed that as integrated fertilization increased, so did the concentrations of soil total or available nutrients and microbial biomass carbon (MBC). Our results also found enhanced soil basal respiration and cumulative carbon mineralization compared to chemical fertilization alone at the same nutrient doses. The activities of soil protease (Pro), β-glucosidase (βG), N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) and acid phosphatase (AP) from the integrated fertilization treatments were significantly higher than those of the treatments without organic manure, so did the activities of soil leucyl aminopeptidase (LAP) and urease (Ure) from the treatment with organic manure in addition to farmer practise fertilization (NPKM2). The stoichiometric ratios, expressed as lnβG/ln(NAG+LAP)/lnPro/lnUre/lnAP, ranged from 1:0.94:1.04:0.67:1.01 to 1:0.98:1.10:0.78:1.25, indicating that the acquisition of C, N and P changed consistently and synchronously under different nutrient management strategies. Integrated fertilization was more beneficial to the acquisition and utilization of soil organic carbon compared to low-molecular-weight organic nitrogen. We concluded that protease and urease should be considered in eco-enzymatic stoichiometric assessments for the hydrolysis of proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates and phosphomonoesters in soil, and integrated fertilization with chemical fertilizers and organic manure should be recommended as a preferable nutrient management system for intensive rice cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W2776674965,"Current expectations on future climate derive from coordinated experiments, which compile many climate models for sampling the entire uncertainty related to emission scenarios, initial conditions, and modelling process. Quantifying this uncertainty is important for taking decisions that are robust under a wide range of possible future conditions. Nevertheless, if uncertainty is too large, it can prevent from planning specific and effective measures. For this reason, reducing the spectrum of the possible scenarios to a small number of one or a few models that actually represent the climate pathway influencing natural ecosystems would substantially increase our planning capacity. Here we adopt a multidisciplinary approach based on the comparison of observed and expected spatial patterns of response to climate change in order to identify which specific models, among those included in the CMIP5, catch the real climate variation driving the response of natural ecosystems. We used dendrochronological analyses for determining the geographic pattern of recent growth trends for three European species of trees. At the same time, we modelled the climatic niche for the same species and forecasted the suitability variation expected across Europe under each different GCM. Finally, we estimated how well each GCM explains the real response of ecosystems, by comparing the expected variation with the observed growth trends. Doing this, we identified four climatic models that are coherent with the observed trends. These models are close to the highest range limit of the climatic variations expected by the ensemble of the CMIP5 models, suggesting that current predictions of climate change impacts on ecosystems could be underestimated."
https://openalex.org/W2778477080,"Influenza virus evolves rapidly due to the accumulated genetic variations on the viral sequence. Unlike in North America and Europe, influenza season in the tropical Southeast Asia spans both the rainy and cool seasons. Thus, influenza epidemiology and viral evolution sometimes differ from other regions, which affect the ever-changing efficacy of the vaccine. To monitor the current circulating influenza viruses in this region, we determined the predominant influenza virus strains circulating in Thailand between January 2016 and June 2017 by screening 7,228 samples from patients with influenza-like illness. During this time, influenza A(H3N2) virus was the predominant influenza virus detected. We then phylogenetically compared the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from a subset of these A(H3N2) strains (n = 62) to the reference sequences and evaluated amino acid changes in the dominant antigenic epitopes on the HA protein structure. The divergence of the circulating A(H3N2) from the A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 vaccine strain formed five genetic groups (designated I to V) within the 3C.2a clade. Our results suggest a marked drift of the current circulating A(H3N2) strains in Thailand, which collectively contributed to the declining predicted vaccine effectiveness (VE) from 74% in 2016 down to 48% in 2017."
https://openalex.org/W2778334510,"To investigate antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) prescription and pregnancy outcomes in pregnancies with epilepsy in Taiwan between 2004 and 2015. We retrospectively reviewed data from the Taiwanese Registry of Epilepsy and Pregnancy (TREP). The TREP registry is a voluntary prospective cohort registry, which tracks pregnant women with epilepsy and AED prescription throughout pregnancy, delivery, and early childhood development. All TREP pregnancies (n = 318) that had completed questionnaires up until delivery or had had an unsuccessful pregnancy were analyzed. Over 94.7% of women had been prescribed AEDs during pregnancy, with 69.0% and 25.7% having received monotherapy, or polytherapy, respectively. Among live births, 12 (3.9%) reported malformation. Cesarean section rate was reported higher than usual (54.5%). In 2004, 73.3% of AEDs prescribed were 1st generation, with 1st generation prescription rates falling to only 8.3% of total prescribed in 2015. AED polytherapy also fell during the study period (40.0% to 20.0%). Cesarean sections were found to be higher for women over 35 years, who had generalized epilepsy, or had experienced an obstetric complication during pregnancy term. Binary logistic regression revealed that Cesarean section was associated with maternal complications (OR = 5.11, CI 95% = 1.11–23.51, p = 0.036), while malformations were associated with obstetric complication (OR = 20.46, CI 95% = 4.80–87.21, p<0.001). Both AED risk types were not associated with complications or malformations. Our sample provides a unique insight into the women with epilepsy with AED use during pregnancy. Cesarean section rate was observed to be higher than usual, but malformation rates remained low. Results indicate a decrease in both 1st generation AEDs and proportion of patients receiving polytherapy over the study period. Obstetric complications were associated with Cesarean section. Fetal malformations were significantly associated with obstetric complications. AED risk factors were not significantly associated with either complications or malformations."

To examine associations, logistic regression analyses were conducted. Focus groups were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a thematic approach.Of 1458 respondents (82%), 1198 (67.5%) were included for analyses. 17.5% reported a need for dietary support. Characteristics associated with this need were: being younger, living without a partner, having a stoma, having diabetes, and being overweight or obese. The main reason for needing support was being unable to initiate and maintain lifestyle changes without support. CRC survivors preferred receiving information soon after diagnosis to make an autonomous, informed decision on improving their lifestyle. They preferred to receive individually-tailored lifestyle support in an autonomy-supportive environment, preferably with involvement of their family and fellow-sufferers.This study has provided knowledge on appropriate support for CRC survivors in need for dietary support to improve health outcomes by promoting adherence to lifestyle and body weight recommendations. Findings can be used to better identify CRC survivors in need for dietary support, and to tailor lifestyle support to their needs and preferences in order to promote uptake, adherence, and effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2780406717,"Surface modification of polymers and paints is a popular and effective way to enhance the properties of these materials. This can be achieved by introducing a thin coating that preserves the bulk properties of the material, while protecting it from environmental exposure. Suitable materials for such coating technologies are inorganic oxides, such as alumina, titania and silica; however, the fate of these materials during long-term environmental exposure is an open question. In this study, polymer coatings that had been enhanced with the addition of silica nanoparticles (SiO2NPs) and subsequently subjected to environmental exposure, were characterized both before and after the exposure to determine any structural changes resulting from the exposure. High-resolution synchrotron macro ATR-FTIR microspectroscopy and surface topographic techniques, including optical profilometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were used to determine the long-term effect of the environment on these dual protection layers after 3 years of exposure to tropical and sub-tropical climates in Singapore and Queensland (Australia). Principal component analysis (PCA) based on the synchrotron macro ATR-FTIR spectral data revealed that, for the 9% (w/w) SiO2NP/polymer coating, a clear discrimination was observed between the control group (no environmental exposure) and those samples subjected to three years of environmental exposure in both Singapore and Queensland. The PCA loading plots indicated that, over the three year exposure period, a major change occurred in the triazine ring vibration in the melamine resins. This can be attributed to the triazine ring being very sensitive to hydrolysis under the high humidity conditions in tropical/sub-tropical environments. This work provides the first direct molecular evidence, acquired using a high-resolution mapping technique, of the climate-induced chemical evolution of a polyester coating. The observed changes in the surface topography of the coating are consistent with the changes in chemical composition."
https://openalex.org/W2779222618,"Adaptive phenotypic plasticity is a key component of the ability of organisms to cope with changing environmental conditions. Fish have been shown to exhibit a substantial level of phenotypic plasticity in response to abiotic and biotic factors. In the present study, we investigate the link between environmental sensitivity assessed globally (revealed by phenotypic variation in body weight) and more targeted physiological and behavioral indicators that are generally used to assess the sensitivity of a fish to environmental stressors. We took advantage of original biological material, the rainbow trout isogenic lines, which allowed the disentangling of the genetic and environmental parts of the phenotypic variance. Ten lines were characterized for the changes of body weight variability (weight measurements taken every month during 18 months), the plasma cortisol response to confinement stress (3 challenges) and a set of selected behavioral indicators. This study unambiguously demonstrated the existence of genetic determinism of environmental sensitivity, with some lines being particularly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and others rather insensitive. Correlations between coefficient of variation (CV) for body weight and behavioral and physiological traits were observed. This confirmed that CV for body weight could be used as an indicator of environmental sensitivity. As the relationship between indicators (CV weight, risk-taking, exploration and cortisol) was shown to be likely depending on the nature and intensity of the stressor, the joint use of several indicators should help to investigate the biological complexity of environmental sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2776655200,"Trauma/hemorrhagic shock is a complex physiological phenomenon that leads to dysregulation of many molecular pathways. For over a decade, hypertonic saline (HTS) has been used as an alternative resuscitation fluid in the setting of trauma/hemorrhagic shock. In addition to restoring circulating volume within the vascular space, studies have shown a positive immunomodulatory effect of HTS. Targeted studies have shown that HTS affects the transcription of several pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the NF-κB–IκB pathway in model cell lines and rats. However, few studies have been undertaken to assess the unbiased effects of HTS on the whole transcriptome. This study was designed to interrogate the global transcriptional responses induced by HTS and provides insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms and pathways affected by HTS. In this study, RNA sequencing was employed to explore early changes in transcriptional response, identify key mediators, signaling pathways, and transcriptional modules that are affected by HTS in the presence of a strong inflammatory stimulus. Our results suggest that primary human small airway lung epithelial cells (SAECS) exposed to HTS in the presence and absence of a strong pro-inflammatory stimulus exhibit very distinct effects on cellular response, where HTS is highly effective in attenuating cytokine-induced pro-inflammatory responses via mechanisms that involve transcriptional regulation of inflammation which is cell type and stimulus specific. HTS is a highly effective anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits the chemotaxis of leucocytes towards a pro-inflammatory gradient and may attenuate the progression of both the innate and adaptive immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2776209394,"Incarcerated women are more vulnerable to developing cervical cancer than women in general; therefore, screening and intervention programs must be included in their healthcare provision. We therefore aimed to investigate the state of cervical cancer screening for imprisoned women in Mato Grosso do Sul, and to analyze the interventions geared toward the control of cervical cancer.This was a cross-sectional study with analysis of primary and secondary data. Interviews were held with 510 women in seven prisons in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The data for 352 medical records were analyzed statistically with the significance level set at 5%. Associations were assessed by the chi-squared test, adjusted by the Bonferroni correction.Most female prisoners had limited education, used tobacco, and had key risk factors for the development of cervical cancer. Half of the women interviewed (n = 255) stated that they had received a Papanicolaou (Pap) test in prison, but 134 (52.5%) of these did not know the result. Of those who had not received a Pap test, 149 (58.4%) stated that this was because of a lack of opportunity. There was no information regarding the provision of Pap tests or subsequent treatment in the medical records of 211 (59.9%) women. No protocols were in place for the provision of Pap tests in prison. There were statistical differences between prisons in terms of test frequency, the information provided to women, and how information was recorded in medical records.The screening of cervical cancer in prisons is neither systematic nor regular, and the results are not communicated to women in a significant number of cases. It is necessary to organize health services within the prison environment, ensuring that tests are done and that there is investigation for human papillomavirus. This could increase the diagnosis of cervical cancer at less advanced stages of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2777260063,"GabR from Bacillus subtilis is a transcriptional regulator belonging to the MocR subfamily of the GntR regulators. The structure of the MocR regulators is characterized by the presence of two domains: i) a N-terminal domain, about 60 residue long, possessing the winged-Helix-Turn-Helix (wHTH) architecture with DNA recognition and binding capability; ii) a C-terminal domain (about 350 residue) folded as the pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) dependent aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) with dimerization and effector binding functions. The two domains are linked to each other by a peptide bridge. Although structural and functional characterization of MocRs is proceeding at a fast pace, virtually nothing is know about the molecular changes induced by the effector binding and on how these modifications influence the properties of the regulator. An extensive molecular dynamics simulation on the crystallographic structure of the homodimeric B. subtilis GabR has been undertaken with the aim to envisage the role and the importance of conformational flexibility in the action of GabR. Molecular dynamics has been calculated for the apo (without PLP) and holo (with PLP bound) forms of the GabR. A comparison between the molecular dynamics trajectories calculated for the two GabR forms suggested that one of the wHTH domain detaches from the AAT-like domain in the GabR PLP-bound form. The most evident conformational change in the holo PLP-bound form is represented by the rotation and the subsequent detachment from the subunit surface of one of the wHTH domains. The movement is mediated by a rearrangement of the linker connecting the AAT domain possibly triggered by the presence of the negative charge of the PLP cofactor. This is the second most significant conformational modification. The C-terminal section of the linker docks into the “active site” pocket and establish stabilizing contacts consisting of hydrogen-bonds, salt-bridges and hydrophobic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2780101029,"Although cascading failures caused by overload on interdependent/interconnected networks have been studied in the recent years, the effect of overlapping links (inter-similarity) on robustness to such cascades in coupled networks is not well understood. This is an important issue since shared links exist in many real-world coupled networks. In this paper, we propose a new model for load-based cascading failures in multiplex networks. We leverage it to compare different network structures, coupling schemes, and overload rules. More importantly, we systematically investigate the impact of inter-similarity on the robustness of the whole system under an initial intentional attack. Surprisingly, we find that inter-similarity can have a negative impact on robustness to overload cascades. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report the competition between the positive and the negative impacts of overlapping links on the robustness of coupled networks. These results provide useful suggestions for designing robust coupled traffic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2776242001,"Working memory impairment is a hallmark feature of schizophrenia and is thought be caused by dysfunctions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and associated brain regions. However, the neural circuit anomalies underlying this impairment are poorly understood. The aim of this study is to assess working memory performance in the chronic phencyclidine (PCP) mouse model of schizophrenia, and to identify the neural substrates of working memory. To address this issue, we conducted the following experiments for mice after withdrawal from chronic administration (14 days) of either saline or PCP (10 mg/kg): (1) a discrete paired-trial variable-delay task in T-maze to assess working memory, and (2) brain-wide c-Fos mapping to identify activated brain regions relevant to this task performance either 90 min or 0 min after the completion of the task, with each time point examined under working memory effort and basal conditions. Correct responses in the test phase of the task were significantly reduced across delays (5, 15, and 30 s) in chronic PCP-treated mice compared with chronic saline-treated controls, suggesting delay-independent impairments in working memory in the PCP group. In layer 2-3 of the prelimbic cortex, the number of working memory effort-elicited c-Fos+ cells was significantly higher in the chronic PCP group than in the chronic saline group. The main effect of working memory effort relative to basal conditions was to induce significantly increased c-Fos+ cells in the other layers of prelimbic cortex and the anterior cingulate and infralimbic cortex regardless of the different chronic regimens. Conversely, this working memory effort had a negative effect (fewer c-Fos+ cells) in the ventral hippocampus. These results shed light on some putative neural networks relevant to working memory impairments in mice chronically treated with PCP, and emphasize the importance of the layer 2-3 of the prelimbic cortex of the PFC."
https://openalex.org/W2776074059,"Although estimates of the annual methane (CH4) flux from agriculturally managed peatlands exist, knowledge of controls over the variation of CH4 at different time-scales is limited due to the lack of high temporal-resolution data. Here we present CH4 fluxes measured from May 2014 to April 2016 using the eddy covariance technique at an abandoned peatland pasture in western Newfoundland, Canada. The goals of the study were to identify the controls on the seasonal variations in CH4 flux and to quantify the annual CH4 flux. The seasonal variation in daily CH4 flux was not strong in the two study years, however a few periods of pronounced emissions occurred in the late growing season. The daily average CH4 flux was small relative to other studies, ranging from -4.1 to 9.9 nmol m-2 s-1 in 2014–15 and from -7.1 to 12.1 nmol m-2 s-1 in 2015–16. Stepwise multiple regression was used to investigate controls on CH4 flux and this analysis found shifting controls on CH4 flux at different periods of the growing season. During the early growing season CH4 flux was closely related to carbon dioxide fixation rates, suggesting substrate availability was the main control. The peak growing season CH4 flux was principally controlled by the CH4 oxidation in 2014, where the CH4 flux decreased and increased with soil temperature at 50 cm and soil water content at 10 cm, but a contrasting temperature-CH4 relation was found in 2015. The late growing season CH4 flux was found to be regulated by the variation in water table level and air temperature in 2014. The annual CH4 emission was near zero in both study years (0.36 ± 0.30 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 in 2014–15 and 0.13 ± 0.38 g CH4 m-2 yr-1 in 2015–16), but fell within the range of CH4 emissions reported for agriculturally managed peatlands elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2779197794,"Post-translational modifications significantly broaden the epitope repertoire for major histocompatibility class I complexes (MHC-I) and may allow viruses to escape immune recognition. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection of H-2b mice generates CD8+ CTL responses directed towards several MHC-I-restricted epitopes including the peptides GP92 (CSANNSHHYI) and GP392 (WLVTNGSYL), both with a N-glycosylation site. Interestingly, glycosylation has different effects on the immunogenicity and association capacity of these two epitopes to H-2Db. To assess the structural bases underlying these functional results, we determined the crystal structures of H-2Db in complex with GP92 (CSANNSHHYI) and GP392 (WLVTNGSYL) to 2.4 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that while glycosylation of GP392 most probably impairs binding, the glycosylation of the asparagine residue in GP92, which protrudes towards the solvent, possibly allows for immune escape and/or forms a neo-epitope that may select for a different set of CD8 T cells. Altogether, the presented results provide a structural platform underlying the effects of post-translational modifications on epitope binding and/or immunogenicity, resulting in viral immune escape."

This information is modulated by inhibitory input arising from local interneurons and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons, leading to alterations of receptive field properties of thalamocortical neurons. Local GABAergic interneurons provide two distinct synaptic outputs: axonal (F1 terminals) and dendritic (F2 terminals) onto dLGN thalamocortical neurons. By contrast, TRN neurons provide only axonal output (F1 terminals) onto dLGN thalamocortical neurons. It is unclear if GABAA receptor-mediated currents originating from F1 and F2 terminals have different characteristics. In the present study, we examined multiple characteristics (rise time, slope, halfwidth and decay τ) of GABAA receptor-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic synaptic currents (mIPSCs) originating from F1 and F2 terminals. The mIPSCs arising from F2 terminals showed slower kinetics relative to those from F1 terminals. Such differential kinetics of GABAAR-mediated responses could be an important role in temporal coding of visual signals."
https://openalex.org/W2776623273,"Multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles (NPs) can offer additional opportunities for modifying the electronic, optical and catalytic properties by the control of composition, configuration and size of individual nanostructures that are consisted of more than single element. In this paper, the fabrication of bimetallic Pd-Ag NPs is systematically demonstrated via the solid state dewetting of bilayer thin films on c-plane sapphire by governing the temperature, time as well as composition. The composition of Pd-Ag bilayer remarkably affects the morphology of alloy nanostructures, in which the higher Ag composition, i.e. Pd0.25Ag0.75, leads to the enhanced dewetting of bilayers whereas the higher Pd composition (Pd0.75Ag0.25) hinders the dewetting. Depending on the annealing temperature, Pd-Ag alloy nanostructures evolve with a series of configurations, i.e. nucleation of voids, porous network, elongated nanoclusters and round alloy NPs. In addition, with the annealing time set, the gradual configuration transformation from the elongated to round alloy NPs as well as size reduction is demonstrated due to the enhanced diffusion and sublimation of Ag atoms. The evolution of various morphology of Pd-Ag nanostructures is described based on the surface diffusion and inter-diffusion of Pd and Ag adatoms along with the Ag sublimation, Rayleigh instability and energy minimization mechanism. The reflectance spectra of bimetallic Pd-Ag nanostructures exhibit various quadrupolar and dipolar resonance peaks, peak shifts and absorption dips owing to the surface plasmon resonance of nanostructures depending on the surface morphology. The intensity of reflectance spectra is gradually decreased along with the surface coverage and NP size evolution. The absorption dips are red-shifted towards the longer wavelength for the larger alloy NPs and vice-versa."

https://openalex.org/W2781354872,"Planar intra-cortical electrode (Utah) arrays provide a unique window into the spatial organization of cortical activity. Reconstruction of the current source density (CSD) underlying such recordings, however, requires “inverting” Poisson’s equation. For inter-laminar recordings, this is commonly done by the CSD method, which consists in taking the second-order spatial derivative of the recorded local field potentials (LFPs). Although the CSD method has been tremendously successful in mapping the current generators underlying inter-laminar LFPs, its application to planar recordings is more challenging. While for inter-laminar recordings the CSD method seems reasonably robust against violations of its assumptions, is it unclear as to what extent this holds for planar recordings. One of the objectives of this study is to characterize the conditions under which the CSD method can be successfully applied to Utah array data. Using forward modeling, we find that for spatially coherent CSDs, the CSD method yields inaccurate reconstructions due to volume-conducted contamination from currents in deeper cortical layers. An alternative approach is to “invert” a constructed forward model. The advantage of this approach is that any a priori knowledge about the geometrical and electrical properties of the tissue can be taken into account. Although several inverse methods have been proposed for LFP data, the applicability of existing electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) inverse methods to LFP data is largely unexplored. Another objective of our study therefore, is to assess the applicability of the most commonly used EEG/MEG inverse methods to Utah array data. Our main conclusion is that these inverse methods provide more accurate CSD reconstructions than the CSD method. We illustrate the inverse methods using event-related potentials recorded from primary visual cortex of a macaque monkey during a motion discrimination task."
