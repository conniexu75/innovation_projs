Gut microbiota bacterial depletions and altered metabolic activity at 3 months are implicated in childhood atopy and asthma1. We hypothesized that compositionally distinct human neonatal gut microbiota (NGM) exist, and are differentially related to relative risk (RR) of childhood atopy and asthma. Using stool samples (n = 298; aged 1–11 months) from a US birth cohort and 16S rRNA sequencing, neonates (median age, 35 d) were divisible into three microbiota composition states (NGM1–3). Each incurred a substantially different RR for multisensitized atopy at age 2 years and doctor-diagnosed asthma at age 4 years. The highest risk group, labeled NGM3, showed lower relative abundance of certain bacteria (for example, Bifidobacterium, Akkermansia and Faecalibacterium), higher relative abundance of particular fungi (Candida and Rhodotorula) and a distinct fecal metabolome enriched for pro-inflammatory metabolites. Ex vivo culture of human adult peripheral T cells with sterile fecal water from NGM3 subjects increased the proportion of CD4+ cells producing interleukin (IL)-4 and reduced the relative abundance of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cells. 12,13-DiHOME, enriched in NGM3 versus lower-risk NGM states, recapitulated the effect of NGM3 fecal water on relative CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ cell abundance. These findings suggest that neonatal gut microbiome dysbiosis might promote CD4+ T cell dysfunction associated with childhood atopy."
https://openalex.org/W2518664057,"Dopamine neurons encode the difference between actual and predicted reward, or reward prediction error (RPE). Although many models have been proposed to account for this computation, it has been difficult to test these models experimentally. Here we established an awake electrophysiological recording system, combined with rabies virus and optogenetic cell-type identification, to characterize the firing patterns of monosynaptic inputs to dopamine neurons while mice performed classical conditioning tasks. We found that each variable required to compute RPE, including actual and predicted reward, was distributed in input neurons in multiple brain areas. Further, many input neurons across brain areas signaled combinations of these variables. These results demonstrate that even simple arithmetic computations such as RPE are not localized in specific brain areas but, rather, distributed across multiple nodes in a brain-wide network. Our systematic method to examine both activity and connectivity revealed unexpected redundancy for a simple computation in the brain."

Currently available treatments for schizophrenia are often effective in ameliorating psychotic symptoms, but also induce metabolic, cognitive, and motor side effects, limiting their therapeutic utility. The seminal finding that the M1/M4-preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist xanomeline demonstrated robust antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia patients (Shekhar et al., 2008Shekhar A. Potter W.Z. Lightfoot J. Lienemann J. Dubé S. Mallinckrodt C. Bymaster F.P. McKinzie D.L. Felder C.C. Selective muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline as a novel treatment approach for schizophrenia.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2008; 165: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) generated a major interest in developing selective M1 and M4 agonists and understanding the roles of these receptors in forebrain circuits (Foster et al., 2014aFoster D.J. Choi D.L. Conn P.J. Rook J.M. Activation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors as potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.Neuropsychiatr. Dis. Treat. 2014; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, all known mAChR agonists are non-selective and activate peripheral M2 and M3 receptors, leading to adverse effects (Bymaster et al., 2003Bymaster F.P. Carter P.A. Yamada M. Gomeza J. Wess J. Hamilton S.E. Nathanson N.M. McKinzie D.L. Felder C.C.

Neurosci. 2003; 17: 1403-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). By targeting allosteric sights on mAChRs, we and others have succeeded in identifying highly subtype-selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of individual mAChR subtypes that avoid activation of peripheral mAChRs. Interestingly, highly selective M4 PAMs have robust antipsychotic-like effects in multiple rodent models. While the mechanisms by which M4 PAMs exert their behavioral effects are not entirely clear, these compounds reverse multiple in vivo effects of psychomotor stimulants that induce increases in extracellular dopamine (DA; Bubser et al., 2014Bubser M.

These studies raise the possibility that M4 PAMs may act by inhibiting DA release from midbrain DA neurons. However, the hypothesis that selective M4 PAMs inhibit DA release has not been directly tested. Furthermore, while M4 can act as a presynaptic heteroreceptor to inhibit glutamate release in the striatum (Pancani et al., 2014Pancani T. Bolarinwa C. Smith Y. Lindsley C.W. Conn P.J. Xiang Z. M4 mAChR-mediated modulation of glutamatergic transmission at corticostriatal synapses.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), this receptor is not expressed in DA neurons and is not likely to inhibit DA release by direct actions on DA terminals. We now report that activation of M4 induces a sustained inhibition of electrically or optically induced DA release in midbrain slices that is potentiated by M4 PAMs and persists for more than 30 min after receptor activation. This sustained inhibition of DA release is independent of nicotinic receptor (nAChR) signaling, suggesting that it is not mediated by autoreceptors on cholinergic interneurons. Instead, use of genetically modified mice revealed that this sustained inhibition of striatal DA release is mediated by M4 expressed on a subpopulation of striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) that express D1 DA receptors (D1-SPNs). Surprisingly, both the sustained inhibition of DA release and antipsychotic-like behavioral effects induced by an M4 PAM were found to require intact endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated CB2 cannabinoid receptor signaling. Taken together, these studies identify a novel signaling pathway through which activation of M4 receptors on SPNs dampens dopaminergic signaling and highlights the importance of this pathway to the antipsychotic-like efficacy observed with M4 PAMs. We determined the ability of mAChR activation to modulate striatal DA release by bath applying the non-selective mAChR agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M), while monitoring electrically evoked DA release via fast scan voltammetry (Figure S1A, available online). Consistent with previous studies (Threlfell et al., 2010Threlfell S. Clements M.A. Khodai T. Pienaar I.S. Exley R. Wess J. Cragg S.J. Striatal muscarinic receptors promote activity dependence of dopamine transmission via distinct receptor subtypes on cholinergic interneurons in ventral versus dorsal striatum.J.

Characterization of central inhibitory muscarinic autoreceptors by the use of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), addition of 10 μM Oxo-M caused a transient inhibition of DA release that returned to baseline within 10 min of removing Oxo-M from the bath (Figure 1A). However, at higher concentrations (30 μM), Oxo-M induced a sustained inhibition of DA release that persisted long after (>30 min) drug washout (Figure 1B). Previous studies have demonstrated that electrical stimulation of cholinergic afferents in the striatum can increase tonic DA release by activation of β2-containing nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) on DA neuron terminals (Champtiaux et al., 2003Champtiaux N. Gotti C. Cordero-Erausquin M. David D.J. Przybylski C. Léna C. Clementi F. Moretti M. Rossi F.M. Le Novère N. et al.Subunit composition of functional nicotinic receptors in dopaminergic neurons investigated with knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 7820-7829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, mAChR inhibition of DA release induced by electrical stimulation in striatal slices has been ascribed in large part to activation of mAChR autoreceptors on cholinergic terminals that inhibit ACh release and thereby inhibit nAChR-mediated increases in DA release (Threlfell et al., 2010Threlfell S. Clements M.A. Khodai T. Pienaar I.S. Exley R. Wess J. Cragg S.J. Striatal muscarinic receptors promote activity dependence of dopamine transmission via distinct receptor subtypes on cholinergic interneurons in ventral versus dorsal striatum.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 3398-3408Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To assess the effects of mAChR activation on nAChR-independent DA release, we pretreated the slices with the β2-selective nAChR antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine hydrobromide (DHβE, 1 μM). Pretreatment with DHβE completely blocked DA release induced by optical stimulation of cholinergic interneurons (Figure S1B), while partially blocking electrically induced DA transients (Figure S1C). This suggests that this nAChR antagonist can completely inhibit nAChR-mediated increases in DA release as previously observed (Threlfell et al., 2012Threlfell S. Lalic T. Platt N.J. Jennings K.A. Deisseroth K. Cragg S.J. Striatal dopamine release is triggered by synchronized activity in cholinergic interneurons.Neuron. 2012; 75: 58-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with DHβE significantly reduced the Oxo-M induced inhibition of electrically evoked DA release at early time points (Figures 1C and 1E). However, the Oxo-M-induced sustained inhibition was not significantly altered by DHβE pretreatment (Figures 1C and 1F), suggesting that this sustained inhibition of DA release is not mediated by inhibition of nAChR effects. To remove effects of electrical stimulation on cholinergic terminals and selectively activate DA terminals, we utilized mice that selectively express ChR2 in DA transporter (DAT)-expressing neurons (DAT-Cre x ChR2 mice). Optical stimulation in slices from DAT-Cre x ChR2 mice induced robust DA transients (Figure S1D). In these mice, application of 30 μM Oxo-M had a blunted effect at early time points (Figures 1D and 1E), whereas the sustained inhibition at later time points was unchanged (Figures 1D and 1F). Importantly, inclusion of DHβE had no effect on optically evoked DA transients or Oxo-M mediated regulation of optically evoked DA release from DAT-Cre x ChR2 mice (Figure S1E). Collectively, these findings suggest that while the acute inhibition is largely dependent on nAChR activation, the sustained inhibition of DA release is independent of nAChR signaling. The M4 receptor is expressed in numerous neuronal populations in the striatum (Figure 2A). In order to determine the role of M4 in mediating the sustained inhibition of DA release observed with Oxo-M, we utilized tissue specific knockout mice in combination with the novel M4-selective PAM VU0467154. Consistent with its activity as a PAM, application of VU0467154 (3 μM) had no effect on DA release when applied alone (Figure S1F), however, VU0467154 significantly potentiated the inhibition of DA release induced by 10 μM Oxo-M at sustained time points (Figures 2B and 2D), suggesting a key role for M4 in mediating the sustained inhibition of DA release. However, M4 is not expressed in DA neurons (Weiner et al., 1990Weiner D.M. Levey A.I. Brann M.R. Expression of muscarinic acetylcholine and dopamine receptor mRNAs in rat basal ganglia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1990; 87: 7050-7054Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), suggesting that M4 is not likely to serve as a presynaptic heteroreceptor that directly inhibits DA release in DA terminals. Since this sustained effect of Oxo-M on DA release is independent of nAChR activation, it is also not likely to be mediated by activation of M4 autoreceptors on cholinergic terminals. The large majority of M4 in striatum is present on D1-SPNs (Ince et al., 1997Ince E. Ciliax B.J. Levey A.I. Differential expression of D1 and D2 dopamine and m4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor proteins in identified striatonigral neurons.Synapse. 1997; 27: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that this subpopulation of M4 could in some way modulate DA release. To assess this, we used mice in which M4 was selectively deleted from D1-expressing neurons (D1-M4 knockout [KO] mice). Electrically evoked DA release was similar in magnitude in both D1-M4 KOs and control littermates (floxed M4 receptor mice; M4 fl/fl; data not shown). However, the acute inhibition observed upon application of 10 μM Oxo-M was significantly reduced in the D1-M4 KO mice (28.2% ± 9.1% acute inhibition of DA release, n = 6) compared to littermate controls (72.3% ± 7.1% acute inhibition of DA release, n = 6; p < 0.05; and two-tailed Mann-Whitney test), suggesting that M4 expressed on D1 neurons may, in part, contribute to the acute inhibition seen with Oxo-M. In the D1-M4 KO mice, the acute inhibition was further enhanced by increasing the Oxo-M concentration to 30 μM (Figure 2E), suggesting that M4 expressed on D1-SPNs is not the only subpopulation of mAChRs contributing to this acute response. Importantly, VU0467154 had no effect on Oxo-M modulation of DA release in D1-M4 KO slices at any of the Oxo-M concentrations examined (Figures 2C–2E). Furthermore, the sustained inhibition of DA release observed in littermate control mice after application of Oxo-M (30 μM) in the presence of DHβE was completely absent in D1-M4 KO mice (Figures 2F and 2G). Collectively, these findings suggest that M4 on D1-SPNs contributes to the acute inhibition observed with application of mAChR agonist, but is solely responsible for the sustained inhibition of DA signaling observed after mAChR activation. SPNs do not project to DA terminals, suggesting that in these acute slices M4 must alter DA release via a form of non-synaptic transmission. One of the best studied forms of non-synaptic communication in the striatum involves eCB signaling and activation of CB1 receptors, and this pathway has been demonstrated to play a key role in M4-mediated modulation of striatal synaptic plasticity (Shen et al., 2015Shen W. Plotkin J.L. Francardo V. Ko W.K. Xie Z. Li Q. Fieblinger T. Wess J. Neubig R.R. Lindsley C.W. et al.M4 muscarinic receptor signaling ameliorates striatal plasticity deficits in models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Neuron. 2015; 88: 762-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the selective CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (1 μM) had no effect on M4 modulation of DA release, suggesting that CB1 is not involved (data not shown). Interestingly, while the CB2 cannabinoid receptor is not thought to play a major role in regulation of neurotransmitter release, a recent study suggests that DA neurons express the CB2 receptor (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang H.Y. Gao M. Liu Q.R. Bi G.H. Li X. Yang H.J. Gardner E.L. Wu J. Xi Z.X. Cannabinoid CB2 receptors modulate midbrain dopamine neuronal activity and dopamine-related behavior in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E5007-E5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a combination of genetic and pharmacological tools to determine whether CB2 receptors play a role in M4 effects on DA release. Similar to results in M4 fl/fl mice, VU0467154 significantly potentiated the sustained inhibition of DA release observed after bath application of 10 μM Oxo-M in wild-type (WT) mice (Figures 3A and 3D ). Strikingly, the CB2 antagonist AM630 (3 μM) had no effect on DA release alone (data not shown), but blocked VU0467154 potentiation of Oxo-M effects (Figures 3B and 3D). Furthermore, the effects of VU0467154 were absent in CB2 KO mice (Figures 3C and 3D), confirming a critical role for the CB2 receptor in mediating this response. The CB2-dependence of the sustained reductions in DA release suggests that activation of M4 on SPNs could facilitate the formation and/or release of an eCB. Production and concurrent physiological effects of eCBs can be stimulated via a multitude of mechanisms at various synapses with some of these mechanisms being Ca2+-dependent and others being Ca2+-independent (Gladding et al., 2009Gladding C.M. Fitzjohn S.M. Molnár E. Metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression: molecular mechanisms.Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). While M4 canonically signals through the G protein Gαi, there are many examples of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that, in addition to coupling with Gαi, can activate multiple G proteins and signaling pathways including intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. To evaluate if M4 in SPNs could promote Ca2+ release, single-cell Ca2+ mobilization experiments were performed in M1 KO mice that expressed tdTomato in D1-expressing neurons. These mice allowed us to visualize and patch D1-SPNs as well as isolate M4 as the only known mAChR subtype in these cells. Either current injection or activation of group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors produced robust Ca2+ transients (Figure S2). In contrast, mAChR activation did not induce Ca2+ transients in D1-SPNs (Figure S2A). To further evaluate a potential role for intracellular Ca2+ signaling in the mAChR-induced inhibition of DA release, slices were pretreated with either 3 μM thapsigargin to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores or 30 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) to antagonize the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor. None of these treatments had any effect on M4-mediated sustained inhibitions of DA release (Figure 3F). However, bath application of thapsigargin blocked mGlu-mediated Ca2+ transients in D1-SPNs, suggesting that this treatment was effective at depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores (Figures S2C and S2D). These data suggest that the observed M4-mediated effects on sustained DA release are not likely to be dependent on M4-induced Ca2+ mobilization. Previous examples of Ca2+-independent eCB-mediated effects arising from SPNs as well as other brain regions have been demonstrated to occur through diacylglycerol (DAG) lipase, which plays a key role in the synthesis of the eCB 2-arachinonoylglycerol (2-AG; Chevaleyre and Castillo, 2003Chevaleyre V.

RGS4 is required for dopaminergic control of striatal LTD and susceptibility to parkinsonian motor deficits.Neuron. 2012; 73: 347-359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that mAChR-induced sustained reductions in DA release were blocked by pretreatment with the DAG lipase inhibitor DO-34 (Figures 3E and 3F). Collectively, these studies suggest that M4 expressed on SPNs can lead to CB2 activation through activation of DAG-lipase and formation of the eCB 2-AG. We next evaluated the effects of VU0467154 on amphetamine-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI; Figure 4A) of the acoustic startle response, a preclinical model of sensory motor gating deficits in schizophrenia patients that is reversed by M4 PAMs (Byun et al., 2014Byun N.E. Grannan M. Bubser M. Barry R.L. Thompson A. Rosanelli J. Gowrishankar R. Kelm N.D. Damon S. Bridges T.M. et al.Antipsychotic drug-like effects of the selective M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor positive allosteric modulator VU0152100.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2014; 39: 1578-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Both D1-M4 KO mice and control littermates (M4 fl/fl) had similar baseline acoustic startle responses that were not altered by dosing with amphetamine or VU0467154 alone or in combination (Figure S3). VU0467154 (10 mg/kg; intraperitoneal [i.p.]) alone had no effect on PPI compared to vehicle (74.2% ± 3.7% and 72.1% ± 3.8% PPI, respectively). Amphetamine (4 mg/kg; subcutaneous [s.c.]) induced a robust decrease in PPI in both control and D1-M4 KO mice (Figure 4B). In control littermates, this amphetamine disruption was significantly reversed by pretreatment with VU0467154 (Figure 4B, left). However, VU0467154 had no effect on amphetamine-disrupted PPI in D1-M4 KO mice (Figure 4B, right), highlighting the importance of this M4 subpopulation in mediating VU0467154 effects on antipsychotic-like behaviors. In addition, the CB2 receptor antagonist AM630 (10 mg/kg; i.p.) inhibited the ability of VU0467154 (10 mg/kg; i.p.) to reverse amphetamine-induced disruption of PPI (Figure 4C), but had no effect in the absence of VU0467154 (27.6% ± 7% and 26.3% ± 4.9% PPI in the absence and presence of AM630). We also examined MK801-induced hyperlocomotion, another behavioral paradigm that is used to predict antipsychotic-like efficacy of novel compounds. Consistent with our recent report (Bubser et al., 2014Bubser M. Bridges T.M. Dencker D. Gould R.W. Grannan M. Noetzel M.J. Lamsal A. Niswender C.M. Daniels J.S. Poslusney M.S. et al.Selective activation of M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors reverses MK-801-induced behavioral impairments and enhances associative learning in rodents.ACS Chem. Neurosci. 2014; 5: 920-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), VU0467154 significantly reversed MK-801-induced ambulation. This effect of VU0467154 was partially blocked by AM630 (Figure S4). Taken together, these findings support the novel concept that activation of M4 in D1-SPNs induces eCB release, resulting in a CB2-mediated sustained inhibition of DA release and that these actions contribute to the antipsychotic-like effects of the M4 PAM (Figure 4D). Clinical findings suggest that modulation of mAChR signaling can be efficacious in the cognitive, negative, and psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic and Alzheimer’s disease patients (Bodick et al., 1997Bodick N.C. Offen W.W. Levey A.I. Cutler N.R. Gauthier S.G. Satlin A. Shannon H.E. Tollefson G.D. Rasmussen K. Bymaster F.P. et al.Effects of xanomeline, a selective muscarinic receptor agonist, on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer disease.Arch.

Felder C.C. Selective muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline as a novel treatment approach for schizophrenia.Am. J. Psychiatry. 2008; 165: 1033-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Preclinical studies suggest that selective activation of the M4 receptor may provide a strategy to obtain therapeutic effects, while minimizing the side effects observed with broad spectrum cholinergic/muscarinic compounds (Foster et al., 2014aFoster D.J. Choi D.L. Conn P.J. Rook J.M. Activation of M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors as potential treatments for Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.Neuropsychiatr. Dis. Treat. 2014; 10: 183-191PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which M4 activation exerts antipsychotic efficacy has not been established. Here, we make two key findings that further elucidate the mechanism whereby M4 activation leads to antipsychotic-like effects in preclinical models. First, we report that activation of M4 in the striatum causes a sustained reduction in striatal DA release. This M4-mediated reduction in DA release is novel in that it is sustained at time points well after washout of mAChR agonists, which is reminiscent of long-term depression (LTD) observed at glutamatergic synapses (Gladding et al., 2009Gladding C.M. Fitzjohn S.M. Molnár E. Metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression: molecular mechanisms.Pharmacol. Rev. 2009; 61: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the inhibition of DA release is mediated by M4 receptors expressed on D1-SPNs, which are striatal projection neurons that are postsynaptic targets of dopaminergic projections to the striatum. Interestingly, M4-mediated sustained reductions in DA release are blocked by inhibiting DAG lipase, suggesting that M4 on SPNs modulates DA terminals via the eCB signaling molecule 2-AG. Second, we demonstrate that both the VU0467154-mediated effects on DA release and the antipsychotic-like behavioral effects require CB2 receptor signaling. Collectively, these studies highlight a novel interaction between muscarinic and eCB signaling pathways in the striatum leading to reduced dopaminergic signaling and highlight the importance of these pathways in mediating the antipsychotic-like behavioral effects observed with M4 PAMs. Previous studies have suggested that mAChR agonist-induced inhibition of striatal DA release is mediated primarily by autoreceptors on cholinergic interneurons (Threlfell et al., 2010Threlfell S. Clements M.A. Khodai T. Pienaar I.S. Exley R. Wess J. Cragg S.J. Striatal muscarinic receptors promote activity dependence of dopamine transmission via distinct receptor subtypes on cholinergic interneurons in ventral versus dorsal striatum.J.

Characterization of central inhibitory muscarinic autoreceptors by the use of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor knock-out mice.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1709-1717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which may include both M2 and M4 mAChR subtypes. Here, we find that Oxo-M induced an acute inhibition of DA release that was significantly reduced either in the presence of nAChR antagonist or with direct optical stimulation of DA terminals. While the acute inhibition was largely nAChR-dependent, and accordingly likely to be mediated by autoreceptors, it was not completely abolished under conditions that removed nAChR signaling. Furthermore, the acute inhibition seen with Oxo-M was reduced in D1-M4 KO mice compared to littermate controls. These findings suggest that the acute inhibition observed after mAChR agonist application involves multiple receptor subtypes and populations likely including: M2, M4 (located both presynaptically and postsynaptically), and M5 (Foster et al., 2014bFoster D.J.

Muscarinic regulation of dopamine and glutamate transmission in the nucleus accumbens.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: 8124-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Importantly, we also report a novel sustained inhibition of DA release that was observed at time points well after removal of Oxo-M. Unlike the acute inhibition, this sustained inhibition of DA release is independent of nAChR-signaling. Application of the M4-selective PAM VU0467154 in acute brain slices had no effect on its own, likely owing to the reduced activity of striatal cholinergic interneurons, and corresponding low levels of ACh tone, in ex vivo brain slices compared to in vivo (Shen et al., 2015Shen W. Plotkin J.L. Francardo V. Ko W.K. Xie Z. Li Q. Fieblinger T. Wess J. Neubig R.R. Lindsley C.W. et al.M4 muscarinic receptor signaling ameliorates striatal plasticity deficits in models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Neuron. 2015; 88: 762-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, when VU0467154 was included with a submaximal concentration of agonist, it potentiated the sustained inhibition of DA release. In the striatum, the majority of M4 is expressed on D1-expressing SPNs, and it was found that the VU0467154-mediated effects on DA release and reversal of specific behavioral effects of psychomotor stimulants were dependent on expression of M4 expressed in D1-SPNs. These data are consistent with a previous report suggesting that some behavioral effects of the non-selective orthosteric mAChR agonist xanomeline also require activation of M4 receptors on D1-expressing neurons (Dencker et al., 2011Dencker D. Wörtwein G. Weikop P. Jeon J. Thomsen M. Sager T.N. Mørk A. Woldbye D.P. Wess J. Fink-Jensen A. Involvement of a subpopulation of neuronal M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the antipsychotic-like effects of the M1/M4 preferring muscarinic receptor agonist xanomeline.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 5905-5908Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). While these data suggest that M4 on D1-SPNs are critically important for mediating antipyschotic-like efficacy, we cannot rule out a role for M4 expressed on other D1-expressing populations. Collectively, these data provide exciting new insights into the mechanisms by which activation of M4 receptors in these neurons can regulate DA-dependent behaviors. Because SPNs do not make synaptic connections with DA terminals, we hypothesized that M4 receptors on SPNs must alter DA release via a form of non-synaptic transmission. A recent study demonstrated that M4 activation with M4 PAMs could modulate multiple forms of spike-timing dependent plasticity at corticostriatal synapses via an eCB-dependent mechanism. These effects on plasticity were absent when M4 was deleted from D1-expressing neurons and required intact CB1 receptor signaling (Shen et al., 2015Shen W. Plotkin J.L. Francardo V. Ko W.K. Xie Z. Li Q. Fieblinger T. Wess J. Neubig R.R. Lindsley C.W. et al.M4 muscarinic receptor signaling ameliorates striatal plasticity deficits in models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.Neuron. 2015; 88: 762-773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Most previously described eCB actions in the CNS are primarily mediated by CB1. However, we found that a selective antagonist of CB1 receptors did not inhibit the effect of M4 activation on DA release. In contrast, selective blockade or genetic deletion of CB2 receptors completely blocked the ability of M4 PAMs to inhibit DA release. Furthermore, the M4-mediated sustained reductions in DA release were completely blocked by a DAG-lipase inhibitor, suggesting a key role for 2-AG in mediating these effects. Collectively, these findings suggest that the subpopulation of M4 on direct pathway SPNs can efficiently promote eCB signaling in the striatum with important physiological implications. In addition to changes in synaptic plasticity induced by CB1 activation, reduced DA release via CB2 activation could impact forms of synaptic plasticity that are modulated by D1 and D2 receptor activation. In the future, it will be important to fully parse out the effects of M4 activation on overall striatal function that are mediated by M4 on SPNs (regulation of DA release through CB2 activation, activation of CB1 receptors on glutamatergic, and GABAergic terminals) and activation of M4 in other neuronal populations. The finding that CB2 was required for M4-mediated modulation of DA release was surprising in the light of previous studies indicating that CB1 and CB2 were thought to be primarily expressed in the CNS and immune system, respectively. However, this original dichotomy has been challenged by recent studies that have found CB2 expressed in numerous brain areas (Mechoulam and Parker, 2013Mechoulam R. Parker L.A. The endocannabinoid system and the brain.Annu. Rev. Psychol. 2013; 64: 21-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), including data suggesting that DA neurons express CB2 receptors (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang H.Y. Gao M. Liu Q.R. Bi G.H. Li X. Yang H.J. Gardner E.L. Wu J. Xi Z.X. Cannabinoid CB2 receptors modulate midbrain dopamine neuronal activity and dopamine-related behavior in mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: E5007-E5015Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CB2 activation has been demonstrated to modulate cocaine-induced locomotion (Xi et al., 2011Xi Z.X. Peng X.Q. Li X. Song R. Zhang H.Y. Liu Q.R. Yang H.J. Bi G.H. Li J. Gardner E.L. Brain cannabinoid CB2 receptors modulate cocaine’s actions in mice.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), and CB2 function has been linked to schizophrenia in patients and to schizophrenia-related behaviors in rodent models (Ishiguro et al., 2010Ishiguro H. Horiuchi Y. Ishikawa M. Koga M. Imai K. Suzuki Y. Morikawa M. Inada T. Watanabe Y. Takahashi M. et al.Brain cannabinoid CB2 receptor in schizophrenia.Biol. Psychiatry. 2010; 67: 974-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, Ortega-Alvaro et al., 2011Ortega-Alvaro A. Aracil-Fernández A. García-Gutiérrez M.S. Navarrete F. Manzanares J. Deletion of CB2 cannabinoid receptor induces schizophrenia-related behaviors in mice.Neuropsychopharmacology. 2011; 36: 1489-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrate that CB2 blockade occluded M4-mediated behavioral effects in two preclinical behavioral models predictive of antipsychotic efficacy. While activation of M4 leading to CB2 activation on DA terminals is the most parsimonious explanation of our results, it is not clear what population(s) of CB2 mediate these effects. Further studies with tissue-specific CB2 KO mice will be needed to determine the role of CB2 receptors expressed on various neuronal and glial populations in modulating DA release and DA-dependent behaviors. In addition to providing a novel mechanism whereby M4 activation can lead to antipsychotic-like efficacy, these studies suggest that CB2-selective agonists could provide an exciting new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia. The present study is especially important in the context of currently available antipsychotic agents that act by blocking striatal DA receptors. While exerting antipsychotic activity through blockade of midbrain DA receptors, DA receptor antagonists also block DA receptors in the cortex and other brain regions where they induce adverse effects, including impaired cognitive function. In contrast, M4 PAMs improve cognitive function in animal models (Bubser et al., 2014Bubser M. Bridges T.M. Dencker D. Gould R.W. Grannan M. Noetzel M.J. Lamsal A. Niswender C.M. Daniels J.S.

Neurosci. 2014; 5: 920-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These studies provide a mechanism by which M4 may act locally to reduce DA signaling without blockade of DA receptors throughout the CNS. The combined cellular and behavioral studies reported suggest that this mechanism may be responsible, at least in part, for the antipsychotic-like effects of M4 PAMs. Voltammetry data plotted with box and whisker plots were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s or Bonferroni post hoc test where appropriate.

https://openalex.org/W2520124487,"Excitatory neurotransmission plays a key role in epileptogenesis. Correspondingly, AMPA-subtype ionotropic glutamate receptors, which mediate the majority of excitatory neurotransmission and contribute to seizure generation and spread, have emerged as promising targets for epilepsy therapy. The most potent and well-tolerated AMPA receptor inhibitors act via a noncompetitive mechanism, but many of them produce adverse side effects. The design of better drugs is hampered by the lack of a structural understanding of noncompetitive inhibition. Here, we report crystal structures of the rat AMPA-subtype GluA2 receptor in complex with three noncompetitive inhibitors. The inhibitors bind to a novel binding site, completely conserved between rat and human, at the interface between the ion channel and linkers connecting it to the ligand-binding domains. We propose that the inhibitors stabilize the AMPA receptor closed state by acting as wedges between the transmembrane segments, thereby preventing gating rearrangements that are necessary for ion channel opening."

We hypothesized that treatment with D-series resolvins (RvD2 or RvD1) would attenuate murine AAA formation through alterations in macrophage polarization and cytokine expression. Male C57/B6 mice (n = 9 per group) 8 to 12 wk old received RvD2 (100 ng/kg/treatment), RvD1 (100 ng/kg/treatment), or vehicle only every third day beginning 3 d before abdominal aortic perfusion with elastase as prevention. Aortas were collected 14 d after elastase perfusion. Cytokine analysis (n = 5 per group) or confocal microscopy (n = 4 per group) was performed. In a separate experiment, RvD2 was provided to mice with small AAAs 3 d after elastase treatment (n = 8 per group). Additionally, apolipoprotein E knockout mice treated with angiotensin II (1000 ng/kg) were treated with RvD2 or vehicle alone (n = 10 per group) in a nonsurgical model of AAA. To determine the effect of RvD2 on macrophage polarization, confocal staining for macrophages, M1 and M2 macrophage subtypes, α-actin, and DAPI was performed. Mean aortic dilation was 96 ± 13% for vehicle-treated mice, 57 ± 9.7% for RvD2-treated mice, and 61 ± 11% for RvD1-treated mice (P < 0.0001). Proinflammatory cytokines macrophage chemotactic protein 1, C-X-C motif ligand 1, and IL-1β were significantly elevated in control animals compared to RvD2- and RvD1-treated animals (P < 0.05), resulting in a reduction of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 activity in resolvin-treated mice in both elastase and angiotensin II models. Treatment of existing small AAAs with RvD2 demonstrated a 25% reduction in aneurysm size at d 14 compared to vehicle alone (P = 0.018). Confocal histology demonstrated a prevalence of M2 macrophages within the aortic medium in mice treated with RvD2. Resolvin D2 exhibits a potent protective effect against experimental AAA formation. Treatment with RvD2 significantly influences macrophage polarization and decreases several important proinflammatory cytokines. Resolvins and the alteration of macrophage polarization represent potential future targets for prevention of AAA.-Pope, N. H., Salmon, M., Davis, J. P., Chatterjee, A., Su, G., Conte, M.

https://openalex.org/W2519747458,"NMDA receptors mediate excitatory synaptic transmission and regulate synaptic plasticity in the central nervous system, but their dysregulation is also implicated in numerous brain disorders. Here, we describe GluN2A-selective negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) that inhibit NMDA receptors by stabilizing the apo state of the GluN1 ligand-binding domain (LBD), which is incapable of triggering channel gating. We describe structural determinants of NAM binding in crystal structures of the GluN1/2A LBD heterodimer, and analyses of NAM-bound LBD structures corresponding to active and inhibited receptor states reveal a molecular switch in the modulatory binding site that mediate the allosteric inhibition. NAM binding causes displacement of a valine in GluN2A and the resulting steric effects can be mitigated by the transition from glycine bound to apo state of the GluN1 LBD. This work provides mechanistic insight to allosteric NMDA receptor inhibition, thereby facilitating the development of novel classes NMDA receptor modulators as therapeutic agents."

Ubiquitylation and degradation of the antioxidant transcription factor NRF2 is considered the primary function of KEAP1; however, few other KEAP1 substrates have been identified. Because KEAP1 is altered in a number of human pathologies and has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target therein, we sought to better understand KEAP1 through systematic identification of its substrates. Toward this goal, we combined parallel affinity capture proteomics and candidate-based approaches. Substrate-trapping proteomics yielded NRF2 and the related transcription factor NRF1 as KEAP1 substrates. Our targeted investigation of KEAP1-interacting proteins revealed MCM3, an essential subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, as a new substrate. We show that MCM3 is ubiquitylated by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 complex in cells and in vitro. Using ubiquitin remnant profiling, we identify the sites of KEAP1-dependent ubiquitylation in MCM3, and these sites are on predicted exposed surfaces of the MCM2–7 complex. Unexpectedly, we determined that KEAP1 does not regulate total MCM3 protein stability or subcellular localization. Our analysis of a KEAP1 targeting motif in MCM3 suggests that MCM3 is a point of direct contact between KEAP1 and the MCM hexamer. Moreover, KEAP1 associates with chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent fashion with kinetics similar to the MCM2–7 complex. KEAP1 is thus poised to affect MCM2–7 dynamics or function rather than MCM3 abundance.

Although NRF2 degradation has long been thought to be the primary function of KEAP1, we have shown that KEAP1 associates with a number of interesting and diverse proteins, suggesting previously unknown roles for KEAP1 (19.Goldfarb D.

In support of this concept, three substrates have recently been reported for the KEAP1 E3 ligase: IKBKB (21.Lee D.F. Kuo H.P. Liu M. Chou C.K. Xia W. Du Y. Shen J. Chen C.T. Huo L. Hsu M.C. Li C.W.

All three substrates contain an ETGE or ESGE motif that is essential for their interactions with and ubiquitylation by KEAP1. Although we have a strong understanding of the dynamics and regulation of NRF2 as a KEAP1 substrate, these other substrates are less well studied. IKBKB is reported to be a KEAP1 substrate targeted for autophagy-mediated degradation, PGAM5 is thought to be ubiquitylated and targeted to the proteasome, and KEAP1-mediated PALB2 ubiquitylation regulates its function by blocking its interaction with BRCA1 (21.Lee D.F.

Thus, the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 ligase is capable of ubiquitylating its substrates to regulate substrate stability through either proteasome-mediated or autophagy-mediated degradation or to regulate substrate function by directing protein-protein interactions. In addition to the vital role the pathway plays in normal physiology, perturbations in KEAP1-NRF2 signaling have been reported in a variety of diseases, including cancer and inflammatory, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases (25.Barone M.C.

The high mutation frequency suggests a role for KEAP1-NRF2 in cancer progression. KEAP1 loss is thought to promote tumorigenesis through hyperactivation of NRF2, although little is known about other effects of KEAP1 mutation or loss. A better understanding of KEAP1 substrates would enhance our understanding of both normal KEAP1 function and of KEAP1-mutant tumors. We sought to define new KEAP1 substrates and to determine the function of their ubiquitylation by KEAP1. Here we identify a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase minichromosome maintenance 3 (MCM3) as a KEAP1 substrate. We selected it from our set of potential KEAP1 substrates for further study based on its important role in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, human MCM subunits do not undergo ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during normal proliferation; instead, the chromatin loading of the MCM complex is tightly controlled during the cell cycle to ensure once-per-cell cycle genome duplication. MCM complexes are chromatin-loaded strictly during G1 phase, activated in S phase, and progressively unloaded as DNA replication forks terminate (reviewed in Ref. 39.Deegan T.D. Diffley J.F.

Thus, interaction with and polyubiquitylation by KEAP1 represents a potentially novel form of MCM regulation. We suggest that our discovery of KEAP1-mediated MCM3 ubiquitylation establishes a physical link between a key player in the oxidative stress response and chromosome replication. We used two complementary strategies to identify proteins ubiquitylated by the KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 complex. First, we employed parallel affinity capture (PAC) mass spectrometry (Fig. 1A) (53.Tan M.K. Lim H.J. Bennett E.J. Shi Y. Harper J.W. Parallel SCF adaptor capture proteomics reveals a role for SCFFBXL17 in NRF2 activation via BACH1 repressor turnover.Mol. Cell. 2013; 52: 9-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). E3 ubiquitin ligases are processive in action: binding, ubiquitylating and releasing substrates. As such, traditional purification of E3 ligases often fails to identify the transient interactions of co-complexed substrates. The PAC approach uses genetic or pharmacological tools to block substrate degradation, which results in stabilization of the E3-substrate interaction (53.Tan M.K. Lim H.J. Bennett E.J. Shi Y.

HEK293T cells engineered for stable expression of KEAP1 fused with streptavidin binding peptide (SBP) and HA epitope were grown in stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-light medium or SILAC-heavy medium before addition of vehicle or MG132 proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 1A). Mass spectrometry analysis of streptavidin-purified protein complexes from these cells revealed SILAC ratios for KEAP1 and KEAP1-associated proteins (Fig. 1B and supplemental Table S1). As expected, NRF2 abundance increased within the KEAP1 complex following MG132 treatment (SILAC ratio, ∼4). The NRF2-related transcription factor NFE2L1 (henceforth referred to as NRF1) similarly increased within the KEAP1 complex following proteasome inhibition, suggesting that it is also a KEAP1 substrate (SILAC ratio, ∼2). NRF1 is an established KEAP1-associated protein but, surprisingly, has not been reported previously to be a KEAP1 substrate (54.Wang W. Chan J.Y.

https://openalex.org/W2519432484,"Subcellular target recognition in the CNS is the culmination of a multiple-step program including axon guidance, target recognition, and synaptogenesis. In cerebellum, basket cells (BCs) innervate the soma and axon initial segment (AIS) of Purkinje cells (PCs) to form the pinceau synapse, but the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a Semaphorin receptor expressed in BCs, controls both axonal guidance and subcellular target recognition. We show that loss of Semaphorin 3A function or specific deletion of NRP1 in BCs alters the stereotyped organization of BC axon and impairs pinceau synapse formation. Further, we identified NRP1 as a trans-synaptic binding partner of the cell adhesion molecule neurofascin-186 (NF186) expressed in the PC AIS during pinceau synapse formation. These findings identify a dual function of NRP1 in both axon guidance and subcellular target recognition in the construction of GABAergic circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2519543041,"Background Sufficient physical activity is important for solid organ transplant recipients (heart, lung, liver, kidney). However, recipients do not meet the recommended amount or required type of physical activity. The perceived barriers to and facilitators of physical activity in this population are largely unknown. Methods Semi-structured in depth interviews were conducted with solid organ transplant recipients in order to explore experienced barriers and facilitators. Qualitative methodology with thematic line-by-line analysis was used for analysis, and derived themes were classified into personal and environmental factors. Results The most important indicated barriers were physical limitations, insufficient energy level, fear, and comorbidities. The most frequently mentioned facilitators included motivation, coping, consequences of (in)activity, routine/habit, goals/goal priority, and responsibility for the transplanted organ. Neutral factors acting as a barrier or facilitator were self-efficacy and expertise of personnel. A comparison of barriers and facilitators between transplant recipient groups yielded no overt differences. Conclusion Several personal and environmental factors were indicated that should be considered in intervention development to increase physical activity behavior in solid organ transplant recipients."

At these axo-glial contact points, the ectodomain of CNTNAP2 binds the adhesion molecule contactin 2 (CNTN2), forming a molecular bridge that spans the extracellular space, whereas the cytoplasmic tail of CNTNAP2 recruits K+ channels (13.Faivre-Sarrailh C.

CNTNAP2 thus plays a key role in the formation of neural circuits through its impact on neural connectivity, neural migration, synapse development, and synaptic communication. Through its organizing role at the nodes of Ranvier, it may influence nerve conduction as well. The extracellular domain of CNTNAP2 contains eight defined domains: a F58C (discoidin) domain, four LNS domains, two EGF-like repeats, and a fibrinogen-like domain (Fig. 1A). Because CNTNAP2 contains a so-called “neurexin repeat” (LNS-EGF-LNS), it has been suggested that CNTNAPs are members of the neurexin family of synaptic cell adhesion molecules (25.Bellen H.J. Lu Y.

CNTN2 consists of six Ig domains followed by four fibronectin domains, and it is tethered to the cell surface by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (Fig. 1A). At axo-glial contacts, it has been proposed that the ectodomains of CNTNAP2 and CNTN2 form a cis-complex tethered to the axonal membrane, which in turn recruits a second CNTN2 molecule on the opposing glial membrane to form a bridge spanning the axo-glial cleft (13.Faivre-Sarrailh C.

A putatively secreted form of the CNTNAP2 ectodomain generated by the homozygous mutation I1253X causes cortical dysplasia-focal epilepsy in humans, a disorder hallmarked by epilepsy as well as cognitive and behavioral deficits; several heterozygous in-frame deletions affecting the N-terminal F58C, L1, and L2 domains are linked to mental retardation, seizures, and speech deficits (24.Strauss K.A.

Furthermore, many point mutations in the CNTNAP2 ectodomain have been linked to ASD, although their precise clinical impacts remain to be delineated (18.Bakkaloglu B. O'Roak B.J. Louvi A. Gupta A.R.

To gain insight into the structure and function of CNTNAP2, we overexpressed the extracellular domain of CNTNAP2 and its partner, CNTN2. We established that the ectodomains of CNTNAP2 and CNTN2 interact directly and specifically with each other with low nanomolar affinity. Also, we determined the architecture of the large multidomain extracellular region of CNTNAP2 using electron microscopy. By identifying epitopes and characterizing fragments, we assigned domains within the CNTNAP2 molecular envelope. Our data reveal that CNTNAP2 has a very different architecture compared with neurexin 1α, the prototype for the neurexin superfamily, suggesting that CNTNAP2 uses a different strategy to integrate into the synaptic protein network. Furthermore, the molecular shape and dimensions of CNTNAP2 provide molecular insight into how CNTNAP2 functions in the cleft of axo-glial and neuronal contacts as an organizing and adhesive molecule. To delineate the architecture of CNTNAP2 and probe its interaction with CNTN2, we produced a panel of purified recombinant proteins in insect cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The extracellular region of CNTNAP2 is observed as a monodisperse protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼124 kDa by size exclusion chromatography (i.e. close to its calculated molecular mass of 134.1 kDa), suggesting a globular nature (Fig. 2). The CNTN2 ectodomain is also monodisperse in solution, but its apparent molecular mass of ∼326 kDa is much larger than its calculated molecular mass of 108.6 kDa, suggesting that it forms either an elongated or a multimeric species that gel filtration chromatography cannot distinguish between (Fig. 2). To confirm these results, we analyzed the ectodomains of CNTNAP2 and CNTN2 by dynamic light scattering, which revealed a similar difference between the two molecules (i.e. an estimated molecular mass of 168 ± 66 kDa) (polydispersity index 0.154; ∼39% polydispersity) for CNTNAP2 and 444 ± 135 kDa (polydispersity index 0.092; ∼30% polydispersity) for CNTN2, respectively. The monomeric nature of CNTNAP2 was confirmed by electron microscopy (EM) (see below), as it was for CNTN2 as well. 6Z. Lu, M. V. V. V. S. Reddy, Jianfang Liu, A. Kalichava, Jiankang Liu, L.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 13943-13954Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To test whether the ectodomains of CNTNAP2 and CNTN2 are sufficient to bind each other directly, we used a solid phase binding assay and showed that CNTNAP2 binds CNTN2 with ∼3 nm affinity (Fig. 3, A and B). We confirmed this interaction with surface plasmon resonance (SPR). CNTN2 immobilized on a biosensor surface bound CNTNAP2 with high affinity (KD ∼1.43 ± 0.01 nm) with kinetic parameters ka ∼(186.0 ± 0.01) × 104 m−1 s−1 and kd ∼(26.50 ± 0.006) × 10−4 s−1 (Fig. 3C). In the reverse assay, immobilized CNTNAP2 also bound soluble CNTN2 with nanomolar affinity (KD ∼8 ± 3 nm) and kinetic parameters ka ∼(8.63 ± 0.03) × 104 m−1 s−1 and kd ∼(6.96 ± 0.02) × 10−4 s−1 (Fig. 3D). The higher affinity observed when CNTN2 is immobilized suggests that constraining the flexibility of CNTN2 may increase its affinity for CNTNAP2. Regardless, both the solid phase and SPR assays demonstrated that the CNTNAP2 and CNTN2 ectodomains bind each other directly with nanomolar affinity. To assess the specificity of this interaction, we tested the binding of CNTN2 and CNTN1, respectively, to a CNTNAP2-coupled biosensor by SPR and revealed that although CNTN2 binds CNTNAP2 readily, CNTN1 does not (Fig. 3, E and F). However, when the contactins were immobilized on the biosensor (the “reverse orientation”), there was little difference between the two, which we believe could be due to the increased affinity gained by constraining the conformation of the long and flexible contactin molecules on the sensor (yielding a ∼6-fold difference in affinity for CNTNAP2 and CNTN2; Fig. 3, C and D). To assess the architecture of CNTNAP2, we used negative staining electron microscopy (NS-EM), because the relatively small molecular mass of CNTNAP2 (134 kDa) makes it challenging to image by cryo-EM. The CNTNAP2 ectodomain is observed as a monomer that is ∼151 Å long and ∼90 Å wide (Fig. 4A). Analysis of 12 representative CNTNAP2 particles revealed a structure composed of four discrete globular densities: a large lobe, a middle lobe clearly composed of two adjacent globules, and a small lobe (Fig. 4B). To reduce the noise, 53,774 particle images were submitted to 200 reference-free two-dimensional (2D) class averaging (Fig. 4C). To highlight the major features of CNTNAP2 and its organization, representative particles from the reference-free class averages were contrasted next to schematic representations, revealing an F-shaped structure (Fig. 4, D and E). To determine the three-dimensional (3D) structure of CNTNAP2, a multireference single-particle reconstruction method was used to refine the particle images (34.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). To avoid potential bias introduced by initial models during the single-particle 3D refinement and reconstruction stage, we used initial models that were derived from experimental data obtained through electron tomography (ET). In brief, eight representative molecules were selected and imaged from a series of tilt angles. The tilt images from each molecule were aligned and back-projected to produce a corresponding ab initio 3D reconstruction of each molecule using the individual particle electron tomography (IPET) method (35.Zhang L. Ren G. IPET and FETR: experimental approach for studying molecular structure dynamics by cryo-electron tomography of a single-molecule structure.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e30249Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A–D). These eight IPET ab initio 3D reconstructions served as initial models to carry out the multirefinement algorithm with EMAN (34.Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high-resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5E). The 3D reconstructions refined from 53,774 particles also indicated that CNTNAP2 forms an asymmetric, F-shaped molecule composed of three discrete regions: a large lobe (88 × 47 Å), a middle lobe (91 × 40 Å), and a small lobe (54 × 44 Å). The CNTNAP2 ectodomain contains a striking combination of compact lobes that flex with respect to each other via molecular hinges. As shown for the panel of representative particles, the large, middle, and small lobes maintain themselves as well defined entities, whereas the lobes flex with respect to each other (Fig. 5, D and E). This conformational heterogeneity produces a portfolio of F-shaped particles reminiscent of a running dog (Fig. 5F). To ex"

Method Eighty-one Norwegian families with two- to seven-year-old children (52 boys) who had scored ≥ 120 on the Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI) were randomly assigned to receive either PCIT or TAU. The families were assessed 6 and 18 months after beginning treatment. Parenting skills were measured using the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding System (DPICS), and child behavior problems were measured using the ECBI and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results Linear growth curve analyses revealed that the behavior problems of children receiving PCIT improved more compared with children receiving TAU according to mother reports (ECBI d = .64, CBCL d = .61, both p < .05) but not according to father report. Parents also improved with regard to Do and Don’t skills (d = 2.58, d = 1.46, respectively, both p ≤ .001). At the 6-month assessment, which often occurred before treatment was finished, children who had received PCIT had lower father-rated ECBI and mother-rated CBCL-scores (p = .06) compared with those who had received TAU. At the 18-month follow-up, the children who had received PCIT showed fewer behavior problems compared with TAU according to mother (d = .37) and father (d = .56) reports on the ECBI and mother reports on the CBCL regarding externalizing problems (d = .39). Parents receiving PCIT developed more favorable Do Skills (6-month d = 1.81; 18-month d = 1.91) and Don’t Skills (6-month d = 1.46; 18-month d = 1.42) according to observer ratings on the DPICS compared with those receiving TAU. Conclusion Children receiving PCIT in regular clinical practice exhibited a greater reduction in behavior problems compared with children receiving TAU, and their parents' parenting skills improved to a greater degree compared with those receiving TAU.

https://openalex.org/W2519114887,"Adrenomedullin 2 (ADM2) is an endogenous bioactive peptide belonging to the calcitonin gene-related peptide family. Our previous studies showed that overexpression of ADM2 in mice reduced obesity and insulin resistance by increasing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue. However, the effects of ADM2 in another type of thermogenic adipocyte, beige adipocytes, remain to be understood. The plasma ADM2 levels were inversely correlated with obesity in humans, and adipo-ADM2-transgenic (tg) mice displayed resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity with increased energy expenditure. Beiging of subcutaneous white adipose tissues (WAT) was more noticeably induced in high-fat diet-fed transgenic mice with adipocyte-ADM2 overexpression (adipo-ADM2-tg mice) than in WT animals. ADM2 treatment in primary rat subcutaneous adipocytes induced beiging with up-regulation of UCP1 and beiging-related marker genes and increased mitochondrial uncoupling respiration, which was mainly mediated by activation of the calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR)·receptor activity-modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) complex and PKA and p38 MAPK signaling pathways. Importantly, this adipocyte-autonomous beiging effect by ADM2 was translatable to human primary adipocytes. In addition, M2 macrophage activation also contributed to the beiging effects of ADM2 through catecholamine secretion. Therefore, our study reveals that ADM2 enhances subcutaneous WAT beiging via a direct effect by activating the CRLR·RAMP1-cAMP/PKA and p38 MAPK pathways in white adipocytes and via an indirect effect by stimulating alternative M2 polarization in macrophages. Through both mechanisms, beiging of WAT by ADM2 results in increased energy expenditure and reduced obesity, suggesting ADM2 as a novel anti-obesity target."

After controlling for possible confounders, we observed a significant increase in the incidence of hospitalizations over the study period when bronchiectasis was a secondary diagnosis. When bronchiectasis was the primary diagnosis we observed a significant decline in the incidence. In all cases, this pathology was more frequent in males, and the average age and comorbidity increased significantly during the study period (p<0.001). When bronchiectasis was the primary diagnosis, the most frequent secondary diagnosis was Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. When bronchiectasis was the secondary diagnosis, the most frequent primary diagnosis was COPD. IHM was low, tending to decrease from 2004 to 2013 (p<0.05). The average LOHS decreased significantly during the study period in both cases (p<0.001). The mean cost per patient decreased in patients with bronchiectasis as primary diagnosis, but it increased for cases of bronchiectasis as secondary diagnosis (p<0.001).Our results reveal an increase in the incidence of hospital admissions for patients with bronchiectasis as a secondary diagnosis from 2004 to 2013, as opposed to cases of bronchiectasis as the primary diagnosis. Although the average age and comorbidity significantly increased over time, both IHM and average LOHS significantly decreased."
https://openalex.org/W2520199825,"Understanding the biology behind the epidemicity and persistence of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital environment is critical to control outbreaks of infection. This study investigated the contributing factors to the epidemicity of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) sequence type (ST) 191 by comparing the differences in biofilm formation, expression of biofilm-associated genes, and resistance to desiccation between major epidemic (n = 16), minor epidemic (n = 12), and sporadic (n = 12) clones. Biofilm mass was significantly greater in the major epidemic than the minor epidemic and sporadic clones. Major and minor epidemic clones expressed biofilm-associated genes, abaI, bap, pgaABCD, and csuA/BABCDE, higher than the sporadic clones in sessile conditions. The csuC, csuD, and csuE genes were more highly expressed in the major epidemic than minor epidemic clones. Interestingly, minor epidemic clones expressed more biofilm-associated genes than the major epidemic clone under planktonic conditions. Major epidemic clones were more resistant to desiccation than minor epidemic and sporadic clones on day 21. In conclusion, the epidemic CRAB ST191 clones exhibit a higher capacity to form biofilms, express the biofilm-associated genes under sessile conditions, and resist desiccation than sporadic clones. These phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CRAB ST191 may account for the epidemicity of specific CRAB ST191 clones in the hospital."
https://openalex.org/W2519158631,"DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) are bulky DNA lesions that form both endogenously and following exposure to bis-electrophiles such as common antitumor agents. The structural and biological consequences of DPCs have not been fully elucidated due to the complexity of these adducts. The most common site of DPC formation in DNA following treatment with bis-electrophiles such as nitrogen mustards and cisplatin is the N7 position of guanine, but the resulting conjugates are hydrolytically labile and thus are not suitable for structural and biological studies. In this report, hydrolytically stable structural mimics of N7-guanine-conjugated DPCs were generated by reductive amination reactions between the Lys and Arg side chains of proteins/peptides and aldehyde groups linked to 7-deazaguanine residues in DNA. These model DPCs were subjected to in vitro replication in the presence of human translesion synthesis DNA polymerases. DPCs containing full-length proteins (11–28 kDa) or a 23-mer peptide blocked human polymerases η and κ. DPC conjugates to a 10-mer peptide were bypassed with nucleotide insertion efficiency 50–100-fold lower than for native G. Both human polymerase (hPol) κ and hPol η inserted the correct base (C) opposite the 10-mer peptide cross-link, although small amounts of T were added by hPol η. Molecular dynamics simulation of an hPol κ ternary complex containing a template-primer DNA with dCTP opposite the 10-mer peptide DPC revealed that this bulky lesion can be accommodated in the polymerase active site by aligning with the major groove of the adducted DNA within the ternary complex of polymerase and dCTP.

Because of their enormous size as compared with other nucleobase lesions and their ability to disrupt DNA duplex structure and DNA-protein interactions, DPCs are hypothesized to interfere with DNA replication and transcription (1.Barker S.

In a more recent study, we have shown that human cells deficient in nucleotide excision repair were sensitized toward nitrogen mustard toxicity and contained increased numbers of N7-guanine-conjugated DPC lesions (19.Groehler 4th, A.

Thus, it is critically important to investigate the activity and accuracy of DNA polymerases on DNA-protein and DNA-peptide lesions. The most common site on DNA that participates in DNA-protein cross-linking mediated by bis-electrophiles is the N7 atom of guanine (3.Loeber R.L. Michaelson-Richie E.D. Codreanu S.G. Liebler D.C.

However, to our knowledge, no reports are available in the literature in regard to the replication bypass of N7-guanine adducts, probably because of their labile nature. Alkylation at the N7 atom of 2′-deoxyguanosine creates a positive charge at the affected nucleobase, destabilizing the N-glycosidic bond and leading to spontaneous depurination and abasic site formation (23.Singer B. Grunberger D. Molecular Biology of Mutagens and Carcinogens. Plenum Press, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar, 24.Gates K.S. Nooner T. Dutta S. Biologically relevant chemical reactions of N7-alkylguanine residues in DNA.Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2004; 17: 839-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the present work, we generated a range of hydrolytically stable model DPCs structurally resembling N7-guanine cross-links. Template-primer complexes containing model DPCs were subjected to in vitro polymerization in the presence of human lesion bypass DNA polymerases under steady-state kinetic conditions, and the resulting primer extension products were characterized by gel electrophoresis and HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Finally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted to examine how DNA-peptide lesions can be accommodated within the active site of human lesion bypass polymerase κ. Model DNA-protein and DNA-peptide conjugates were prepared by reductive amination reactions between the Lys/Arg side chains of proteins/peptides and 7-deaza-7-(2-oxoethyl)-2′-deoxyguanosine of DNA (Fig. 1). The latter were formed in situ from 7-deaza-7-(2,3-dihydroxypropan-1-yl)-2′-deoxyguanosine-containing DNA as described in our earlier publication (25.Wickramaratne S. Mukherjee S. Villalta P.W.

In the resulting model cross-links, Lys or Arg side chains of proteins and peptides are conjugated to the 7-deazaguanine residues of DNA via a two-carbon linker, creating a structure that is analogous to DPC lesions induced in cells by antitumor nitrogen mustards (3.Loeber R.L.

Standing start primer extension past dG- and deaza-DHP-dG-containing templates resulted in complete extension products (20-mers) by hPols η and κ (Figs. 4, A and B, and 5, A and B). We found that the 10-mer peptide DPC was bypassed by hPols η and κ albeit with low efficiencies (Figs. 4C and 5C). In contrast, the 23-mer peptide cross-link and all three protein conjugates completely blocked primer extension (Figs. 4, D–G, and 5, D–F). The ability of polymerase η to copy the damaged strand was restored when the protein portion of DPC was digested with proteinase K (Fig. 4H). Taken together, these results indicate that the ability of TLS polymerases to bypass DPC lesions is a function of peptide size with lesions ≥23 amino acids long causing a complete replication block.FIGURE 4.Standing start assays for replication bypass of DNA-peptide and DNA-protein cross-links by hPol η. 9-mer FAMdT primers were annealed with 20-mers containing unmodified dG (A), deaza-DHP-dG (B), or covalent cross-links to 10-mer peptide EQKLISEEDL (C), 23-mer peptide PDAQLVPGINGKAIHLVNNESSE (D), or full-sized protein AlkB (E), histone (His) H4 (F), or eGFP (G). The resulting primer-template duplexes (0.15 μm) were incubated in the presence of hPol η (0.30 μm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of a mixture of dNTPs (500 μm) and quenched at the indicated time points.

Running start experiments were conducted using 13-mer primer P2 (5-CTA TGA FAMTGG TAC C-3) annealed to 39-mer templates T10–T16 (5′-GAA AGA AGX ACA GAA GAG GGT ACC ATC ATA GAG TCA GTG-3′ where X is unmodified dG, deaza-DHP-dG, or DNA-protein conjugate; Table 1 and Fig. 3B). In this primer-template complex, the 3′-end of the primer is placed 10 nucleotides upstream from the adducted site (−10 primer; Fig. 3B). We found that under running start conditions, both 10-mer and 23-mer peptide conjugates were partially bypassed by hPols η and κ to generate full-length products. For both peptide lesions, pronounced pausing was observed 1–2 nucleotides ahead of the adducted site and downstream from the lesion, suggesting inefficient polymerase translocation along the template (Figs. 6, C and D, and 7, C and D). Although the deaza-DHP-dG control caused some degree of polymerase pausing, it was less blocking than the peptide lesions (Figs. 6B and 7B). In contrast, all three DPC lesions completely blocked nucleotide addition, yielding no extension products (Figs. 6, E–G, and 7E). Similar results were observed when the primer was moved farther upstream from the lesion site (Fig. 8). As was the case with standing start experiments, proteinase K-digested cross-links were bypassed (Fig. 6H). Interestingly, replication past proteinase K-digested lesions and peptide cross-links generated large numbers of −3, −2, and −1 products (Fig. 6, C, D, and H). Taken together, our running start experiments are consistent with the standing start results (FIGURE 4., FIGURE 5.), indicating that although peptide DPCs can be bypassed by TLS polymerases η and κ DPCs to full-length proteins completely block DNA replication. In cells, such replication blockage may be relieved by proteolytic degradation of the protein component of DPC (20.Stingele J. Schwarz M.S. Bloemeke N. Wolf P.G. Jentsch S.

https://openalex.org/W2519507161,"Climate change is causing shifts in the amount and frequency of precipitation in many regions, which is expected to have implications for plant performance. Most research has examined the impacts of the amount of precipitation on plants rather than the effects of both the amount and frequency of precipitation. To understand how climate-driven changes in precipitation can affect grassland plants, we asked: (i) How does the amount and frequency of precipitation affect plant performance? (ii) Do plant functional groups vary in their response to variable precipitation? To answer these questions we grew 14 monocot and eudicot grassland species and conducted a factorial manipulation of the amount (70 vs 90mm/month) and frequency (every 3, 15, or 30 days) of precipitation under rainout shelters. Our results show that both the amount and frequency of precipitation impact plant performance, with larger effects on eudicots than monocots. Above- and below-ground biomass were affected by the amount of precipitation and/or the interaction between the amount and frequency of precipitation. Above-ground biomass increased by 21-30% when the amount of precipitation was increased. When event frequency was decreased from 3 to 15 or 30 days, below-ground biomass generally decreased by 18-34% in the 70 mm treatment, but increased by 33-40% in the 90 mm treatment. Changes in stomatal conductance were largely driven by changes in event frequency. Our results show that it is important to consider changes in both the amount and frequency of precipitation when predicting how plant communities will respond to variable precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2518739852,"Purpose To identify the prevalence and preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in an emergency ward setting in a tertiary hospital in Sweden and to what extent the detected ADRs were reported to the Medical Product Agency (MPA). Methods In this prospective cross sectional observational study, 706 patients admitted to one of the Emergency Wards, at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Stockholm during September 2008 –September 2009, were included. The electronic patient records were reviewed for patients’ demographic parameters, prevalence of possible ADRs and assessment of their preventability. In addition, the extent of formal and required ADR reporting to national registers was studied. Results Approximately 40 percent of the patient population had at least one possible ADR (n = 284). In the multivariable regression model, age and number of drugs were significantly associated with risk of presenting with an ADR (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). Sex was not identified as a significant predictor of ADRs (p = 0.27). The most common ADRs were cardiovascular, followed by electrolyte disturbances, and hemorrhage. In 18 percent of the patient population ADRs were the reason for admission or had contributed to admission and 24% of these ADRs were assessed as preventable. The under-reporting of ADRs to the MPA was 99%. Conclusions ADRs are common in Emergency Medicine in tertiary care in Sweden, but under-reporting of ADRs is substantial. The most frequent ADRs are caused by cardiovascular drugs, and significantly associated with age and number of drugs. However, only a minority of the detected serious ADRs contributing to admission could have been avoided by increased risk awareness."

Cardiac-specific transgenic overexpression of human AMPKγ2NI or AMPKγ2RG leads to constitutive AMPK activation and the WPW phenotype in mice. However, overexpression of these mutant proteins also caused profound, non-physiological increase in cardiac glycogen, which might abnormally alter the true phenotype.

Similar to the reported phenotypes of mice overexpressing AMPKγ2NI or AMPKγ2RG in the heart, both lines developed WPW syndrome and cardiac hypertrophy; however, these effects were independent of cardiac glycogen accumulation. Compared with AMPKγ2WT mice, AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice exhibited reduced body weight, fat mass, and liver steatosis when fed with a high fat diet (HFD). Surprisingly, AMPKγ2RG but not AMPKγ2NI mice fed with an HFD exhibited severe kidney injury characterized by glycogen accumulation, inflammation, apoptosis, cyst formation, and impaired renal function. These results demonstrate that expression of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mutations at physiological levels can induce beneficial metabolic effects but that this is accompanied by WPW syndrome.

The effect of the AMPKγ2RG mutation in the regulation of cardiac-specific ion channels and on early onset of pre-excitation and atrial fibrillation in the WPW patients suggested that AMPKγ2 mutations can cause abnormalities of the cardiac conduction system during development of the heart (20.Gollob M.H.

In a recent report, Kim et al. (21.Kim M. Hunter R.W. Garcia-Menendez L. Gong G. Yang Y.Y. Kolwicz Jr., S.C. Xu J. Sakamoto K. Wang W. Tian R.

To investigate how AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mutations affect cardiac function and metabolism, we generated two knock-in mice harboring single mutation of AMPKγ2NI or AMPKγ2RG. The current study was undertaken to understand the causality of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mutations expressed at physiological levels on the WPW syndrome and to explore whether they affect whole-body metabolism and function of other organs. We hypothesize that these mutations affect not only cardiac function but also whole-body metabolism, especially major metabolic organs, such as liver, skeletal muscle, and kidney. We describe our initial findings in this paper. N488I and R531G mutations in human AMPKγ2 correspond to the N485I and R528G mutations, respectively, in mouse AMPKγ2 due to the absence of three amino acids, Pro-207, Ala-253, and Val-254, in mouse AMPKγ2 (Fig. 1A). Both AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG knock-in mice were generated on a C57BL/6N background. The genotype of all mice was confirmed by sequencing the mutated regions (Fig. 1B). We next measured AMPKα and phospho-AMPKα protein levels in liver and skeletal muscle of the AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice using antibodies recognizing both the α1 and α2 subunits. Knock-in of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mutations did not affect the protein levels of AMPKα and phospho-AMPKα in liver and skeletal muscle as compared with AMPKγ2WT controls (Fig. 1, C and D). mRNA levels of AMPK α-, β-, and γ-subunits in liver and skeletal muscle were not different in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice as compared with AMPKγ2WT mice (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG knock-in mutations had no effect on expression of γ2 subunit and other AMPK subunits. Two main isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), ACC1 and ACC2, are downstream targets of activated AMPK. Phosphorylation of ACC inhibits its enzymatic activity, and this effect is widely employed to reflect the activity of AMPK (22.Davies S.P. Sim A.T. Hardie D.G. Location and function of three sites phosphorylated on rat acetyl-CoA carboxylase by the AMP-activated protein kinase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We therefore used phosphorylated ACC (pACC) (both ACC1 and ACC2) to monitor AMPK activity. In skeletal muscle, pACC was significantly increased in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RGcompared with AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 1, E and F). Liver levels of pACC in AMPKγ2RG mice were significantly higher than in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2WT mice. The pACC level in skeletal muscle was significantly lower than in the liver in AMPKγ2WT mice and showed larger differences among AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice. Based on the level of pACC in different groups, it appeared that both AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG are intrinsically activated and that AMPKγ2RG has the highest activity in skeletal muscle as compared with AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI (Fig. 1F). To investigate the effect of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RGmutations on cardiac electrical conductance, we recorded a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) by using electrocardiography in isoflurane-anesthetized, 8-week-old mice fed with a chow diet. Continuous ECG recording indicated that 50% of AMPKγ2NI and 70% of AMPKγ2RG mice had bradycardia with significantly shortened PR intervals compared with AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 2A and Table 1). The QRS complex in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice appeared similar to that of AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 2A). In particular, compared with AMPKγ2WT mice, no δ wave was observed in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice (Fig. 2A). Sometimes we noticed intermittent pre-excitation due to a probable retrograde conduction in the accessory pathway (Fig. 2A, bottom). Further ECG analysis demonstrated that AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice had intermittent pre-excitation, shortened PR interval, bradycardia, sinus arrhythmia, and occasional premature ventricular contraction (supplemental Table 1). Cardiac pACC in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice was significantly increased as compared with AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 2B), indicating increased AMPK activity in the heart of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice.TABLE 1Relative mRNA levels of AMPK isoforms in heart and kidney of AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice fed with HFD at 26 weeks of agemRNAAMPKγ2WT (n = 4), average CTAMPKγ2NI (n = 4), changeAMPKγ2RG (n = 4), change-fold-foldHeartPrkaa128.01.131.11Prkaa224.61.071.09Prkab126.71.121.07Prkab226.71.191.23*Prkag126.80.78*1.00Prkag226.30.820.70Prkag329.90.730.68*KidneyPrkaa127.90.940.93Prkaa224.71.010.93*Prkab126.81.101.23Prkab229.80.941.17Prkag128.51.241.26Prkag226.31.161.01Prkag330.00.760.92 Open table in a new tab To further understand the effect of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RGmutations on cardiac function, we measured heart weight and quantitated relative mRNA levels of genes associated with cardiac hypertrophy in AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG chow diet-fed mice at 8 weeks of age by using echocardiography. AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice fed with a chow diet developed cardiac hypertrophy at 24 weeks of age (Fig. 2C). Feeding the mice with an HFD did not worsen cardiac function based on echocardiograms finding obtained at 24 weeks of age as compared with mice fed with chow (data not shown). Relative mRNA levels of AMPK subunits were quantitated in the heart of AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice fed an HFD (Fig. 2D). Overall, there was no significant difference between AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice in all AMPK subunits except for slightly reduced γ1 and γ3 in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice, respectively, and a slightly induced β2 in AMPKγ2RG mice (Table 1). Biomarkers of cardiac hypertrophy, NPPa, NPPb, Myh6, and Myh7 (23.Accornero F. van Berlo J.H. Benard M.J. Lorenz J.N. Carmeliet P. Molkentin J.D. Placental growth factor regulates cardiac adaptation and hypertrophy through a paracrine mechanism.Circ. Res. 2011; 109: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), were measured in the heart of AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice fed with chow diet at 26 weeks of age. mRNA levels of NPPb and Myh7 were significantly increased in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice, and Myh6 was significantly increased in AMPKγ2RG mice compared with AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 2D). Cardiac glycogen was measured in AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice fed with a chow diet or HFD at 26 weeks of age. Cardiac glycogen levels were not changed in AMPKγ2NI mice compared with AMPKγ2WT mice fed with either chow diet or HFD but were significantly increased by 5.6- and 46.9-fold in AMPKγ2RG mice fed with chow diet and HFD, respectively (Fig. 2E). Although the effect was less pronounced, glycogen content in skeletal muscle was significantly increased by 4- and 1.9-fold in AMPKγ2RG mice fed with the chow diet and HFD, respectively (Fig. 2F). Glycogen contents in skeletal muscle of AMPKγ2NI mice were significantly increased on HFD and showed a trend of increase on chow diet compared with that of AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 2F). Exercise, a well known weight loss measure, is known to activate AMPK (24.Birk J.B. Wojtaszewski J.F. Predominant α2/β2/γ3 AMPK activation during exercise in human skeletal muscle.J. Physiol. 2006; 577: 1021-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and AMPK activation by AMPK activators could induce fatty acid oxidation (25.Merrill G.F. Kurth E.J. Hardie D.G. Winder W.W. AICA riboside increases AMP-activated protein kinase, fatty acid oxidation, and glucose uptake in rat muscle.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E1107-E1112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine these potential effects in our models, we examined the effects of AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mutations in mice fed with a chow diet or HFD on body weight and composition and other metabolic parameters. On a chow diet, body weight and body weight gain of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice were similar to AMPKγ2WT controls (Fig. 3, A, B, F, and G). On the HFD, both AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice gained less weight as compared with AMPKγ2WT controls (Fig. 3, B and G). Body composition analysis demonstrated that the major differences in body weight between AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG were due to fat mass (Fig. 3, C, E, and H–J). At 20 weeks of age, the fat mass of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice was lower than that of AMPKγ2WT mice by 44 and 32.5%, respectively (Fig. 3, D and I). Food intake of AMPKγ2RG mice was significantly decreased versus AMPKγ2WTmice on both diets and trended lower for AMPKγ2NI versus AMPKγ2WT mice (Fig. 3K). There were no significant differences in glucose and insulin tolerance in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice fed with a chow diet compared with AMPKγ2WT mice, consistent with the lack of difference in body weight. By contrast, on an HFD, both AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice showed improved glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance (Fig. 4, A–F). Plasma levels of TG, cholesterol, and free fatty acid were significantly lower in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG than in AMPKγ2WT mice on the HFD under fed conditions (Fig. 4, G and H). The plasma ketone levels were significantly increased in AMPKγ2RG mice on the HFD (Fig. 4H). At study termination, metabolic organs, including liver, heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas of AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice, were investigated for histological changes by H&E staining. No obvious histological changes of heart, skeletal muscle, and pancreas were observed in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice compared with AMPKγ2WTmice fed with either chow diet or HFD (data not shown). AMPKγ2WT mice developed liver steatosis after being fed with HFD for 17 weeks, whereas AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG appear to be protected with no obvious accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver (Fig. 4I). Altogether, AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice are resistant to HFD-induced body weight gain and show improved metabolic parameters compared with AMPKγ2WT mice. During histopathological evaluation, we observed dramatic morphological changes in kidneys of AMPKγ2RG mice. Upon chow diet feeding, kidneys of AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI mice appeared to be normal, whereas moderate to severe cyst dilatation (occasionally with proteinosis) of distal and collector tubules was evident in the medullar rays of AMPKγ2RG mice kidneys at 26 weeks of age (Fig. 5A). Kidneys of AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI mice fed an HFD remained normal. In contrast, HFD-fed AMPKγ2RG mice developed severe kidney injury that manifests gross discoloration of the kidney (Fig. 5B). There was also dramatic tubular degeneration, as indicated by papilla dilatation and severe cystic changes (with proteinosis) in the collecting ducts (Fig. 5B). Many foci of necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration, and regeneration were observed in the tubulointerstitial compartment in HFD-fed AMPKγ2RG mice, indicating severe inflammation in the kidney (Fig. 5B). Foci of amyloid deposits and areas of collagen fibers were also observed in AMPKγ2RG mouse kidneys (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. 1A). Kidney glycogen content was not changed in AMPKγ2NI mice compared with AMPKγ2WTmice fed with either chow diet or HFD. By contrast, it was significantly increased by 4.3- and 6.8-fold in AMPKγ2RG mice fed with a chow diet and HFD, respectively (Fig. 5C). To further investigate kidney function, AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice were maintained on either the chow diet or HFD until 26 weeks of age. A 24-h urine collection sample was used to measure albumin, creatinine, NGAL, and KIM1, and these parameters were normalized to urinary creatinine concentration (Fig. 5, D–J). Creatinine in AMPKγ2RG mice on HFD showed a trend of slight reduction, which might be associated with a trend of decrease in lean mass (Fig. 3J). The urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) has been used as a marker reflecting change of renal function, and KIM-1 and NGAL levels have been used as renal tubular injury biomarkers (26.de Geus H.R. Betjes M.G. Bakker J. Biomarkers for the prediction of acute kidney injury: a narrative review on current status and future challenges.Clin. Kidney J. 2012; 5: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). On the chow diet, all parameters in AMPKγ2NI mice were similar to those of AMPKγ2WT mice, whereas they were significantly higher in AMPKγ2RG mice (Fig. 5, H–J). On the chow diet in AMPKγ2RG mice, urinary ACR and excretion of NGAL and KIM1 were increased by 87%, 57%, and 3.4-fold compared with AMPKγ2WT mice. This situation was exacerbated on an HFD, the urinary ACR and excretion of NGAL and KIM1 in AMPKγ2RG mice were increased by 2-, 8.5-, and 27.2-fold compared with AMPKγ2WT mice, indicating impaired renal function and tubular injury in AMPKγ2RG mice (Fig. 5, H–J). Urinary ACR and excretion of NGAL and KIM1 were comparable between AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI mice on HFD (Fig. 5, H–J). Consistent with proteinurea, protein casts in kidney tubules were prominent in AMPKγ2RG mice fed with a chow diet and HFD as shown by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining (supplemental Fig. 1B). There was no significant difference in kidney lipid contents among AMPKγ2WT, AMPKγ2NI, and AMPKγ2RG mice on either the chow diet or HFD, as indicated by oil red O staining and lipid content measurement (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). To investigate the mechanism of kidney injury in AMPKγ2RG mice, we first measured mRNA levels of the seven AMPK subunits and calculated the -fold change of each subunit in AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice over AMPKγ2WT controls. Overall, there was no significant difference between AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice in all AMPK subunits except for a slightly reduced AMPKα2 in AMPKγ2RG mice (Table 1). The differences in AMPK activity in WT versus mutant mice were confirmed by measuring kidney pACC as a function of diet. When fed with a chow diet, pACC in the kidney of AMPKγ2NI and AMPKγ2RG mice was significantly higher than in AMPKγ2WT mice. When the diet was switched to HFD, pACC was significantly higher in the kidney of AMPKγ2RG mice compared with AMPKγ2WT and AMPKγ2NI mice (Fig. 6, A and B). To investigate the cause of kidney injury in AMPKγ2RGmice on HFD, we performed TUNEL staining of kidneys. AMPKγ2RG mouse kidneys were positive for TUNEL staining, indicating active apoptosis (Fig. 6C). It has been reported that AMPK activation inhibits phosphorylation of Akt, which in turn activates FOXO3a, and the latter induces apoptosis in cancer cells (27.Yung M.M. Chan D.W. Liu V.W. Yao K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2518819172,"Ebola virus (EBOV), a member of the Filoviridae that can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates, poses a significant threat to the public health. Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics to prevent and treat EBOV infection. Several vaccines based on the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) are under development, including vectored, virus-like particles, and protein-based subunit vaccines. We previously demonstrated that a subunit vaccine containing the extracellular domain of the Ebola ebolavirus (EBOV) GP fused to the Fc fragment of human IgG1 (EBOVgp-Fc) protected mice against EBOV lethal challenge. Here, we show that the EBOVgp-Fc vaccine formulated with QS-21, alum, or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-poly-L-lysine carboxymethylcellulose (poly-ICLC) adjuvants induced strong humoral immune responses in guinea pigs. The vaccinated animals developed anti-GP total antibody titers of approximately 105−106 and neutralizing antibody titers of approximately 103 as assessed by a BSL-2 neutralization assay based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotypes. The poly-ICLC formulated EBOVgp-Fc vaccine protected all the guinea pigs against EBOV lethal challenge performed under BSL-4 conditions whereas the same vaccine formulated with QS-21 or alum only induced partial protection. Vaccination with a mucin-deleted EBOVgp-Fc construct formulated with QS-21 adjuvant did not have a significant effect in anti-GP antibody levels and protection against EBOV lethal challenge compared to the full-length GP construct. The bulk of the humoral response induced by the EBOVgp-Fc vaccine was directed against epitopes outside the EBOV mucin region. Our findings indicate that different adjuvants can eliciting varying levels of protection against lethal EBOV challenge in guinea pigs vaccinated with EBOVgp-Fc, and suggest that levels of total anti-GP antibodies elicit by protein-based GP subunit vaccines do not correlate with protection. Our data further support the development of Fc fusions of GP as a candidate vaccine for human use."

The aims of this study were therefore (i) to report the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension among adults in Dakar, (ii) to assess the prevalence of general and central obesity, and (iii) to analyze the association between hypertension and general and central obesity.A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2015 on a representative sample of 1000 dwellers of the Senegalese capital aged 20-90.The overall prevalence of hypertension was 24.7%. Among hypertensive respondents, 28.4% were aware of their condition; 16.0% were on antihypertensive medication; 4.9% had controlled blood pressure. The frequency of doctor visits was a significant predictor of awareness (OR = 2.16; p<0.05) and treatment (OR = 2.57; p<0.05) of hypertension. The prevalence of underweight, overweight and general obesity were 12.6%, 19.2% and 9.7% respectively. The prevalence of central obesity was 26% by WC and 39.8% by WHtR. General obesity and central obesity by WHtR significantly predicted HTN among men and women, but not central obesity by WC.This study has demonstrated a high prevalence of hypertension in Dakar and a high prevalence of obesity among women-particularly among older women. The awareness, treatment, and effective control of hypertension are unacceptably low. The blood pressure of women with general obesity, and men with central obesity, in the community should be monitored regularly to limit the burden of cardiovascular disease in Senegal."
https://openalex.org/W2520102978,"The red yeast X. dendrorhous is one of the few natural sources of astaxanthin, a carotenoid used in aquaculture for salmonid fish pigmentation and in the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries for its antioxidant properties. Genetic control of carotenogenesis is well characterized in this yeast; however, little is known about the regulation of the carotenogenesis process. Several lines of evidence have suggested that carotenogenesis is regulated by catabolic repression, and the aim of this work was to identify and functionally characterize the X. dendrorhous MIG1 gene encoding the catabolic repressor Mig1, which mediates transcriptional glucose-dependent repression in other yeasts and fungi. The identified gene encodes a protein of 863 amino acids that demonstrates the characteristic conserved features of Mig1 proteins, and binds in vitro to DNA fragments containing Mig1 boxes. Gene functionality was demonstrated by heterologous complementation in a S. cerevisiae mig1- strain; several aspects of catabolic repression were restored by the X. dendrorhous MIG1 gene. Additionally, a X. dendrorhous mig1- mutant was constructed and demonstrated a higher carotenoid content than the wild-type strain. Most important, the mig1- mutation alleviated the glucose-mediated repression of carotenogenesis in X. dendrorhous: the addition of glucose to mig1- and wild-type cultures promoted the growth of both strains, but carotenoid synthesis was observed only in the mutant strain. Transcriptomic and RT-qPCR analyses revealed that several genes were differentially expressed between X. dendrorhous mig1- and the wild-type strain when cultured with glucose as the sole carbon source. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that catabolic repression in X. dendrorhous is an active process in which the identified MIG1 gene product plays a central role in the regulation of several biological processes, including carotenogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2518776100,"Background Using a food-based analysis, healthy dietary patterns in adults are more expensive than less healthy ones; studies are needed in youth. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine relationships between monetary daily diet cost, diet quality, and parental socioeconomic status. Design and Methods Data were obtained from a representative national sample of 3534 children and young people in Spain, aged 2 to 24 years. Dietary assessment was performed with a 24-hour recall. Mediterranean diet adherence was measured by the KIDMED questionnaire. Average food cost was calculated from official Spanish government data. Monetary daily diet cost was expressed as euros per day (€/d) and euros per day standardized to a 1000kcal diet (€/1000kcal/d). Results Mean monetary daily diet cost was 3.16±1.57€/d (1.56±0.72€/1000kcal/d). Socioeconomic status was positively associated with monetary daily diet cost and diet quality measured by the KIDMED index (€/d and €/1000kcal/d, p<0.019). High Mediterranean diet adherence (KIDMED score 8–12) was 0.71 €/d (0.28€/1000kcal/d) more expensive than low compliance (KIDMED score 0–3). Analysis for nonlinear association between the KIDMED index and monetary daily diet cost per1000kcal showed no further cost increases beyond a KIDMED score of 8 (linear p<0.001; nonlinear p = 0.010). Conclusion Higher monetary daily diet cost is associated with healthy eating in Spanish youth. Higher socioeconomic status is a determinant for higher monetary daily diet cost and quality."
https://openalex.org/W2548061325,"Cardiac ryanodine receptor (Ryr2) Ca2+ release channels and cellular metabolism are both disrupted in heart disease. Recently, we demonstrated that total loss of Ryr2 leads to cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, arrhythmia, and reduced heart rate. Acute total Ryr2 ablation also impaired metabolism, but it was not clear whether this was a cause or consequence of heart failure. Previous in vitro studies revealed that Ca2+ flux into the mitochondria helps pace oxidative metabolism, but there is limited in vivo evidence supporting this concept. Here, we studied heart-specific, inducible Ryr2 haploinsufficient (cRyr2Δ50) mice with a stable 50% reduction in Ryr2 protein. This manipulation decreased the amplitude and frequency of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals in isolated cardiomyocytes, without changes in cardiomyocyte contraction. Remarkably, in the context of well preserved contractile function in perfused hearts, we observed decreased glucose oxidation, but not fat oxidation, with increased glycolysis. cRyr2Δ50 hearts exhibited hyperphosphorylation and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, the key Ca2+-sensitive gatekeeper to glucose oxidation. Metabolomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses revealed additional functional networks associated with altered metabolism in this model. These results demonstrate that Ryr2 controls mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics and plays a specific, critical role in promoting glucose oxidation in cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that partial RYR2 loss is sufficient to cause metabolic abnormalities seen in heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2518808027,"Objective Ezrin and p130Cas are structural proteins with an important role in signaling pathways and have been shown to promote cancer dissemination. We previously reported on overexpression of both ezrin and p130Cas in breast carcinoma effusions compared to primary carcinomas. Since ovarian and breast carcinomas share the ability to disseminate by forming malignant effusions, we sought to study the role of these molecules in ovarian carcinoma (OC). Methods OC cell lines were cultured in two different 3-dimensional conditions, on alginate scaffolds and as spheroids, which served as models for solid tumor and malignant effusions, respectively. shRNA was used to reduce protein expression in the cells. The malignant potential was evaluated by chemo-invasion assay, branching capacity on Matrigel and rate of proliferation. Subsequently, clinical specimens of high-grade serous carcinoma effusions, ovarian tumors and solid metastases were analyzed for ezrin and p130Cas expression. Results Higher ezrin expression was found in cells composing the spheroids compared to their counterparts cultured on alginate scaffold and in clinical samples of malignant effusions compared to solid tumors. In addition, reduced Ezrin expression impaired the invasion ability and the branching capacity of OC cells to a greater extent than reduced p130Cas expression. However, ezrin and p130Cas expression in effusions was unrelated to clinical outcome. Conclusions The 3-dimensional cell cultures were found to mimic the different tumor sites and be applicable as a model. The in vitro results concur with the clinical specimen analysis, suggesting that in OC, the role of ezrin in disease progression is more pronounced than that of p130Cas."
https://openalex.org/W2519051677,"Fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) are the most frequently used metrics to investigate white matter impairments in mental disorders. However, these two metrics are derived from intra-voxel analyses and only reflect the diffusion properties solely within the voxel unit. Local diffusion homogeneity (LDH) is a newly developed inter-voxel metric which quantifies the local coherence of water molecule diffusion in a model-free manner. In this study, 94 schizophrenia patients and 91 sex- and age-matched healthy controls underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examinations. White matter integrity was assessed by FA, MD and LDH. Group differences in these metrics were compared using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS). Compared with healthy controls, schizophrenia patients exhibited reduced FA and increased MD in the corpus callosum, cingulum, internal capsule, fornix and widespread superficial white matter in the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. We also found decreased LDH in the corpus callosum, cingulum, internal capsule and fornix in schizophrenia. Our findings suggest that both intra-voxel and inter-voxel diffusion metrics are able to detect impairments in the anisotropic white matter regions, and intra-voxel diffusion metrics could detect additional impairments in the widespread isotropic white matter regions in schizophrenia."

Incomplete adherence to TB treatment has been identified as one of the most serious remaining problem in tuberculosis control. The following study is aimed at determining the adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment in Equatorial Guinea and its determinants, as well as at assessing the knowledge of the people about the disease. In this cross-sectional study, participants were recruited by non-probabilistic consecutive sampling amongst patients who attended the reference units for TB in Bata and Malabo between March and July 2015. Socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Adherence to treatment and knowledge about TB were assessed by Morisky-Green-Levine and Batalla tests and a questionnaire on adherence related factors specifically prepared for this research. Descriptive statistics were computed to summarize the data and bivariate analyses by adherence profile were performed with χ2 test for categorical data. A total of 98 patients with TB were interviewed. 63.27% of interviewees had good knowledge about TB (Batalla test) while 78.57% of respondents were adherent according to the Morisky-Green-Levine test. A low educational level, lack of family support and lack of medical advice about the disease were significantly associated to lower adherence level. Patients with re-infection (due to relapse or treatment failure) and those who have suffered from drug shortages were also less adherents. The National Programme for TB Control should consider improving the early diagnosis and follow-up of TB cases, as well as the implementation of all components of DOTS (Directly observed Treatment, short-course) strategy all over the country."
https://openalex.org/W2519596458,"Higher use of maternal and neonatal health (MNH) services may reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Kenya. This study aims to: 1) prospectively explore women’s intentions to use MNH services (antenatal care, delivery in a facility, postnatal care, neonatal care) at <20 and 30–35 weeks’ gestation and their actual use of these services; 2) identify predictors of intention-behavior discordance among women with positive service use intentions; 3) examine associations between place of delivery, women’s reasons for choosing it, and birthing experiences. We used data from a 2012–2013 population-based cohort of pregnant women in the Demographic Surveillance Site in Nyanza province, Kenya. Of 1,056 women completing the study (89.1% response rate), 948 had live-births and 22 stillbirths, and they represent our analytic sample. Logistic regression analysis identified predictors of intention-behavior discordance regarding delivery in a facility and use of postnatal and neonatal care. At <20 and 30–35 weeks’ gestation, most women intended to seek MNH services (≥93.9% and ≥87.5%, respectively, for all services assessed). Actual service use was high for antenatal (98.1%) and neonatal (88.5%) care, but lower for delivery in a facility (76.9%) and postnatal care (51.8%). Woman’s age >35 and high-school education were significant predictors of intention-behavior discordance regarding delivery in a facility; several delivery-related factors were significantly associated with intention-behavior discordance regarding use of postnatal and neonatal care. Delivery facilities were chosen based on proximity to women’s residence, affordability, and service quality; among women who delivered outside a health facility, 16.3% could not afford going to a facility. Good/very good birth experiences were reported by 93.6% of women who delivered in a facility and 32.6% of women who did not. We found higher MNH service utilization than previously documented in Nyanza province. Further increasing the number of facility deliveries and use of postnatal care may improve MNH in Kenya."

https://openalex.org/W2518722689,"Both hyponatremia and acute kidney injury (AKI) are common and harmful in hospitalized patients. However, their combined effects on patient mortality have been little studied.We retrospectively enrolled 19191 adult patients who were admitted for 1 year. Pre-existing hyponatremia was defined as a serum sodium level < 135 mmol/L on the first measurement of their admission. AKI was defined as a rise in serum creatinine by ≥ 26.5 μmol/L or ≥ 1.5 times of the baseline value of creatinine during the hospital stay.The prevalence of pre-existing hyponatremia was 8.2%. During a median 6.0 days of hospital stay, the incidence rates of AKI and in-hospital patient mortality were 5.1% and 0.9%, respectively. Pre-existing hyponatremia independently predicted AKI development and in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.300, P = 0.004; HR 2.481, P = 0.002, respectively). Pre-existing hyponatremia and subsequent development of AKI increased in-hospital mortality by 85 times, compared to the patients with normonatremia and no AKI. In subgroup analysis, the AKI group showed higher rates of de novo hypernatremia than the non-AKI group during the admission. De novo hypernatremia, which might be associated with over-correction of hyponatremia, increased in-hospital mortality (HR 3.297, P <0.001), and patients with AKI showed significantly higher rates of de novo hypernatremia than patients without AKI (16.2% vs. 1.4%, P < 0.001, respectively).Pre-existing hyponatremia may be associated with the development of AKI in hospitalized patients, and both hyponatremia and hospital-acquired AKI could have a detrimental effect on short term patient mortality, which might be related to the inappropriate correction of hyponatremia in AKI patients."

The commonly used top-down approaches inferring the toxic mechanism of individual effector proteins from the host's phenotype are often impeded by multiple targets of different effectors as well as by their pleiotropic effects. Here we describe our bottom-up approach, showing that the bacterial type III effector AvrRxo1 of plant pathogens is an authentic phosphotransferase that produces two novel metabolites by phosphorylating nicotinamide/nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide at the adenosine 3′-hydroxyl group. Both products of AvrRxo1, 3′-NADP and 3′-nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (3′-NAADP), are substantially different from the ubiquitous co-enzyme 2′-NADP and the calcium mobilizer 2′-NAADP. Interestingly, 3′-NADP and 3′-NAADP have previously been used as inhibitors or signaling molecules but were regarded as “artificial” compounds so far. Our findings now necessitate a shift in thinking about the biological importance of 3′-phosphorylated NAD derivatives.

Bacterial pathogens cause a multitude of severe human, animal, and plant diseases. The vast majority of these bacterial pathogens rely on sophisticated secretion systems by which they either secrete so-called effector molecules into the vicinity of the host cell or translocate them directly into the host cell cytoplasm. All effector molecules, particularly those that are translocated into the host cell cytoplasm, support bacterial invasion, colonization, and proliferation inside the host. They do so by interfering with or remodeling of important host cell processes as for example disguising the invader from the host's immune system (1.Dean P.

For the latter, plant and animal pathogens face entirely different preconditions. In contrast to animals, plants possess neither a somatic adaptive immune system nor mobile defender cells. Instead, each individual plant cell relies on its innate immunity, enabling it to initiate an appropriate response when infected (3.Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J.

Plant pathogens and integrated defence responses to infection.Nature. 2001; 411: 826-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (2973) Google Scholar). Defense responses of plants against invading microbes are induced at two levels and can eventually culminate in a hypersensitive response (HR) 2The abbreviations used are: HR, hypersensitive response; PTI, pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity; ETS, effector-triggered susceptibility; NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; ETI, effector-triggered immunity; Avr, avirulence; UNAG, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine; SME, small metabolite extract; PK, pyruvate kinase; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; UpA, uridine 5′ → 3′ adenine dinucleotide; AA, amino acid(s); β-me, β-mercaptoethanol; CV, column volume; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; DTE, dithioerythritol; TEV, tobacco etch virus; mS, millisiemens; G6P-DH, d-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; TCEP, tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine); ESI, electrospray ionization. during which affected cells undergo programmed cell death to prevent systemic spread of the pathogen (6.Heath M.C. Hypersensitive response-related death.Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 44: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). On the first level, bacterial elicitor active epitopes are recognized by pattern recognition receptors. These elicitor molecules are thus termed pathogen/microbe-associated molecular patterns. Their recognition by specific receptors initializes pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) (4.Ausubel F.M. Are innate immune signaling pathways in plants and animals conserved?.Nat. Immunol. 2005; 6: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 7.Zipfel C. Early molecular events in PAMP-triggered immunity.Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2009; 12: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Consequently, pathogens evolved effector molecules able to suppress PTI by the host plant and thereby increase microbial pathogenicity (3.Chisholm S.T. Coaker G. Day B. Staskawicz B.J.

Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar). This elaborate bacterial countermove leads to effector-triggered susceptibility (ETS) of the host and re-establishes microbe pathogenicity. Certain plant cultivars are capable of overcoming ETS by the second level of defense in which plant resistance proteins specifically recognize one or multiple effectors. Thereby, plants circumvent the pathogen's abrogation of the PTI response and initiate a cellular defense program, leading to effector-triggered immunity (ETI) (10.Dodds P.N. Rathjen J.P. Plant immunity: towards an integrated view of plant-pathogen interactions.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2010; 11: 539-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2052) Google Scholar, 11.Jones J.D. Dangl J.L. The plant immune system.Nature. 2006; 444: 323-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (8332) Google Scholar). Effectors recognized by resistance proteins are thus termed avirulence (Avr) proteins. Most microbial type III effectors (virulent and/or avirulent) are, however, challenging to study because they are unrelated at their sequence or structural level (12.Potnis N. Krasileva K. Chow V. Almeida N.F. Patil P.B. Ryan R.P. Sharlach M. Behlau F. Dow J.M. Momol M. White F.F. Preston J.F. Vinatzer B.A. Koebnik R. Setubal J.C. Norman D.J. Staskawicz B.J. Jones J.B.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 2549-2554Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), making any a priori prediction of their functional mechanisms difficult. In addition, most pathogens secrete a number of different effectors, thereby targeting different pathways of their host cell simultaneously (15.Galán J.E. Common themes in the design and function of bacterial effectors.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 571-579Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Deducing a specific effector function from the observed infection phenotype is consequently almost impossible. Structural studies of these multifaceted effectors have therefore paved the way for follow-up studies focusing on the identification of their biological targets in the host. Such successful pioneering studies were for instance the identification of E3 ubiquitin ligase domains of AvrPtoB and XopL (16.Janjusevic R. Abramovitch R.B. Martin G.B. Stebbins C.E.

The structural basis for activation of plant immunity by bacterial effector protein AvrPto.Nature. 2007; 449: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). By a similar approach, the structural homology of the effector protein AvrRxo1 from the pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola to nucleotide kinases led to the recent proposal that AvrRxo1 contains a polynucleotide kinase domain with an unknown toxic mechanism in plants (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E. Li J. Zhao B.

AvrRxo1 is a type III effector that is highly conserved in various Asian X. oryzae pv. oryzicola strains (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol.

Domain dissection of AvrRxo1 for suppressor, avirulence and cytotoxicity functions.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e113875Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was originally identified as a gene product of this particular pathogen that elicits a non-host HR in maize lines harboring the Rxo1 resistance gene (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rxo1 was also shown to act as a resistance protein in maize against infection by Paraburkholderia andropogonis (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), a pathogen encoding a protein highly homologous to AvrRxo1 (NCBI entry ALF40614). AvrRxo1 and Rxo1 are therefore most likely involved in a gene-for-gene relationship in certain maize cultivars in which the AvrRxo1 effector is recognized by an ETI program. In contrast, no single gene resistance against X. oryzae pv. oryzicola has been detected in rice (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Hence, AvrRxo1 most likely constitutes a virulence factor that elicits ETS, and the rice Rxo1 homolog does not confer immunity (22.Zhao B. Lin X. Poland J. Trick H. Leach J. Hulbert S. A maize resistance gene functions against bacterial streak disease in rice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 15383-15388Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The role of AvrRxo1 as a virulence factor is further supported by the finding that it is toxic when expressed in tobacco and yeast cells (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol.

Expression of Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria type III effectors in yeast affects cell growth and viability.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2011; 24: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when ectopically expressed in Escherichia coli, AvrRxo1 was shown to inhibit cell growth, a phenotype that could be suppressed by co-expression of AvrRxo2 (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E. Li J. Zhao B.

The AvrRxo2 open reading frame (ORF) is part of a bicistronic operon and is found downstream of the AvrRxo1 ORF in X. oryzae pv. oryzicola (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the bacteriostatic phenotype is most likely accomplished by complex formation as inferred from the extensive interaction interface between AvrRxo1 and AvrRxo2 observed in the crystal structure (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E. Li J. Zhao B.

Given that X. oryzae pv. oryzicola has emerged as a prevalent pathogen that causes rice bacterial leaf streak disease, impairing the production of this staple crop in much of Asia, parts of Africa, and Australia (24.Niño-Liu D.O. Ronald P.C. Bogdanove A.J. Xanthomonas oryzae pathovars: model pathogens of a model crop.Mol. Plant Pathol. 2006; 7: 303-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), investigating the AvrRxo1/AvrRxo2 system as a major contributor to the pathogen's virulence is overdue. Here, we describe our bottom-up approach used to identify the effector function of AvrRxo1. We show that AvrRxo1 is a hitherto unknown type of nucleotide kinase that catalyzes the formation of 3′-NADP and 3′-NAADP, two novel compounds that might interfere with conventional NAD(H)/2′-NADP(H)-dependent pathways and host cell Ca2+ signaling. In addition to revealing the enzymatic function of AvrRxo1, we show that the associated, chaperone-like protein AvrRxo2 acts as a highly potent inhibitor of AvrRxo1. AvrRxo1 from X. oryzae pv. oryzicola is a multidomain protein consisting of a central potential kinase domain and an N-terminal domain that has been suggested to contain a thiol protease active site (20.Zhao B. Ardales E.Y. Raymundo A. Bai J. Trick H.N. Leach J.E. Hulbert S.H. The avrRxo1 gene from the rice pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola confers a nonhost defense reaction on maize with resistance gene Rxo1.Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 2004; 17: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21.Liu H. Chang Q. Feng W. Zhang B. Wu T. Li N. Yao F. Ding X. Chu Z. Domain dissection of AvrRxo1 for suppressor, avirulence and cytotoxicity functions.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e113875Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Whereas the kinase domain is conserved among AvrRxo1 homologs from different plant pathogens (Fig. 1), the N-terminal region is highly divergent, and the potential thiol protease active site is only found in a few Xanthomonas strains. We therefore exclusively used the truncated variant AvrRxo1ΔN88 that lacks the divergent N terminus in our experiments and will refer to this as AvrRxo1 throughout. Apart from the structural homology of this central AvrRxo1 domain with polynucleotide kinases, the recently reported 3D structure of AvrRxo1 revealed a strong homology of AvrRxo1 with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) kinases of the ϵ-ζ toxin-antitoxin family (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E. Li J. Zhao B. Crystal structure of Xanthomonas AvrRxo1-ORF1, a type III effector with a polynucleotide kinase domain, and its interactor AvrRxo1-ORF2.Structure. 2015; 23: 1900-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This raised the question whether AvrRxo1 might be an authentic UNAG kinase or not as the previously identified, characteristic UNAG binding motif of ζ kinases (25.Mutschler H. Meinhart A. ϵ/ζ systems: their role in resistance, virulence, and their potential for antibiotic development.J. Mol. Med. 2011; 89: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) cannot be identified in the effector's primary structure (Fig. 1). In fact, neither we nor others (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E. Li J. Zhao B. Crystal structure of Xanthomonas AvrRxo1-ORF1, a type III effector with a polynucleotide kinase domain, and its interactor AvrRxo1-ORF2.Structure. 2015; 23: 1900-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) could show that AvrRxo1 catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP onto UNAG to a significant extent because only minor traces of a potential UNAG-3P species were detected when a reaction mixture of AvrRxo1 incubated with UNAG and ATP for 5 h was analyzed using anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2a). In contrast, we observed a significant accumulation of ADP and two new, apparently phosphorylated species, indicating that AvrRxo1 is a nucleotide kinase with hitherto uncharacterized substrate specificity (Fig. 2a). Formation of these new species was not dependent on the presence of UNAG as incubation of AvrRxo1 with ATP alone resulted in the accumulation of products with identical retention times (Fig. 2b). Determination of their molecular masses suggested that AvrRxo1 catalyzed the phosphorylation of ATP (m/zobs = 586.0) and ADP (m/zobs = 506.0) in these long term incubation assays. This activity could be assigned to AvrRxo1 because neither of these products accumulated when the catalytically impaired AvrRxo1(D193N) variant was incubated with ATP (supplemental Fig. S1). Because AvrRxo1 harbors the conventional P-loop motif (26.Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. The P-loop—a common motif in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar), we wondered whether the enzyme also utilizes guanine nucleotides as substrates. In contrast to ATP, however, neither GDP nor any new, potentially phosphorylated GTP/GDP species accumulated when AvrRxo1 was incubated with GTP alone (Fig. 2c). We then scrutinized substrate binding site specificities by incubating AvrRxo1 with equimolar amounts of GTP and ADP and found that ADP was phosphorylated under the consumption of GTP (Fig. 2d). The phosphate donor site of AvrRxo1 thus binds ATP as well as GTP, whereas the phosphate acceptor binding site is selective for adenine-containing nucleotides rather than guanine nucleotides. Because we observed significant amounts of residual ATP even after 5 h of incubation at 25 °C with ATP alone (Fig. 2b), we searched for better, adenine-containing substrates. We found that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) was quantitatively phosphorylated by AvrRxo1 after 5 h of incubation, whereas only minor traces of the phosphorylated ADP species were detected (Fig. 2e). NAD must consequently be the superior substrate when compared with ATP or ADP. We next tested whether the oxidation state of the nicotinamide moiety influences phosphorylation efficiency and incubated AvrRxo1 with equimolar amounts of NAD and NADH and reaction-limiting concentrations of ATP. Nearly all NAD was found to be phosphorylated by AvrRxo1, whereas only a minor fraction of NADH was phosphorylated (Fig. 2f). This apparent selection between NAD and NADH by the acceptor substrate binding site under the experimental conditions strongly argues for NAD as a substrate being phosphorylated in vivo. The observed preferential phosphorylation of NAD in vitro prompted the question whether NAD is also the preferred substrate of AvrRxo1 in vivo. We therefore prepared small metabolite extracts (SMEs) from E. coli cells expressing the AvrRxo1 protein and separated them using anion exchange chromatography. We found that cells expressing active AvrRxo1 contained a significant amount of a single nucleotide species with similar retention time as the phosphorylated NAD standard produced in vitro. In contrast, no such species could be detected in SMEs prepared from untransformed or AvrRxo1(D193N)-expressing cells (Fig. 3). To further characterize this nucleotide species, we isolated it in a semipreparative manner from large scale SMEs. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed identical masses for the accumulated small metabolite and the in vitro produced, phosphorylated NAD (m/z = 742.1) (supplemental Fig. S2), and collision-induced dissociation gave comparable fragmentation patterns (Fig. 4, a and b). Additionally, the obtained fragments allowed assigning the site of phosphorylation to the hydroxyl groups of the adenosine moiety.FIGURE 4.AvrRxo1 catalyzes the formation of 3′-phosphorylated NAD. Purified reaction products of AvrRxo1 in vitro reactions and small metabolite extracts were used for characterization by ESI MS-MS, a spectrophotometric assay using the 2′-NADP-dependent enzyme G6P-DH, and NMR spectroscopy. A–C, ESI MS-MS spectra were obtained by selecting the 742.1/743.1-Da heavy, phosphorylated NAD/NAAD species (blue diamonds) and fragmenting them at −45 and −40 eV, respectively. A, ESI MS-MS spectrum of phosphorylated NAD purified from in vitro reactions. The detected fragments correspond to those obtained by fragmenting phosphorylated NAD from SMEs (B) and in vitro phosphorylated NAAD (C). Fragments detected can be ascribed to phosphorylated ADP-ribose (620.0 Da), ADP-ribose (540.1 Da), ATP/phosphorylated ADP (506.0 Da), and ADP (408.0 Da). For a structural representation of the obtained fragments, see supplemental Fig. S3. D, using the 2′-NADP-dependent enzyme G6P-DH, the phosphorylated products of AvrRxo1 were shown to be differently phosphorylated than conventional 2′-NADP. Neither addition of 200 μm in vitro phosphorylated NAD (blue) nor addition of the in vivo product to 200 μm (green) could stimulate G6P-DH activity. In contrast, 200 μm 2′-NADP were rapidly reduced to 2′-NADPH by the enzyme as shown by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm. Hence, AvrRxo1 produces a compound different from 2′-NADP but with identical mass. E, NMR characterization of in vitro phosphorylated NAD showed that the phosphate group transferred by AvrRxo1 is situated at the 3′-hydroxyl group of adenosine (3′A). Although the spectrum for the 3′-proton signal of adenosine (3′A) showed increased peak multiplicity due to 1H-31P coupling in the 1H NMR experiment when compared with the 1H-31P decoupled spectra, the spectrum for the 2′-proton signal (2′A) remained unchanged in both experiments (5.0–4.8 ppm and highlighted in gray). The entire spectra are shown in supplemental Fig. S4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Phosphorylation of NAD at the adenosine ribose moiety by AvrRxo1 could either lead to conventional 2′-NADP or a novel, small metabolite, 3′-NADP. We thus probed phosphorylated NAD purified from AvrRxo1-expressing E. coli cells and the in vitro counterpart for their capability to stimulate activity of the 2′-NADP-dependent enzyme d-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase similarly as described before (27.Shuster L. Kaplan N.O. The preparation and properties of 3′-triphosphopyridine nucleotide.J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 215: 183-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To our surprise, neither of the two compounds could be reduced by the enzyme (Fig. 4d), thereby strongly suggesting that AvrRxo1 catalyzes the formation of 3′-NADP and not conventional 2′-NADP. To directly prove that phosphorylation catalyzed by AvrRxo1 occurs at the 3′-hydroxyl group of the adenosine moiety, we isolated NAD phosphorylated by AvrRxo1 in vitro in a preparative setup and elucidated its structure by 1D and 2D NMR experiments. 31P experiments clearly confirmed the presence of a third phosphate group, but the recorded proton shifts differed significantly from those reported for 2′-NADP (28.Cui Q. Lewis I.A. Hegeman A.D. Anderson M.E. Li J. Schulte C.F. Westler W.M. Eghbalnia H.R. Sussman M.R. Markley J.L. Metabolite identification via the Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 162-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), implying that the 3′-hydroxyl group of the adenosine moiety is being phosphorylated by AvrRxo1 (Fig. 4e). Ultimately, 1H-31P decoupling experiments together with 1H-1H COSY (supplemental Fig. S4) confirmed that the phosphate group transferred onto the NAD molecule by AvrRxo1 is located at the 3′-hydroxyl group of the adenosine moiety. To compare the kinetics of ADP production arising from 3′-NADP formation with those of ATP phosphorylation, we scrutinized AvrRxo1 activity using a quantitative, spectroscopic ATPase steady state assay (29.Berghäuser J. A reactive arginine in adenylate kinase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 397: 370-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, ATP was regenerated from newly formed ADP by pyruvate kinase (PK) upon conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate. The latter was converted to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) upon oxidation of NADH. During all experiments, PK, LDH, and PEP were adjusted to concentrations that allow the background reaction of the detection system to proceed much faster than AvrRxo1, which was checked by ADP control titrations (Fig. 5). Because we knew from previous experiments that NADH, ADP, and ATP can be phosphorylated by AvrRxo1, the assay was performed as a burst/chase experiment. To this end, AvrRxo1 was incubated with either ATP and NAD or ATP alone for 15 min. NADH was then titrated into the reaction setup at equimolar concentrations, and the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored. Because we identified NAD as a suitable substrate, we expected that incubation with ATP and NAD would lead to production of ADP prior to NADH addition. Hence, pyruvate would accumulate substantially and LDH would become the rate-limiting factor, causing a drastic decrease in NADH absorbance (burst). In contrast, incubation with ATP alone should yield minor traces of ADP, and significant amounts thereof are only formed after NADH addition to the assay. Here, AvrRxo1 becomes rate-limiting over LDH, and the decrease in absorbance is much slower. As expected, this experimental setup also revealed that NAD is preferred over ATP (Fig. 5). Because AvrRxo1 was recently suggested to be a polynucleotide kinase based on structural homology (19.Han Q. Zhou C. Wu S. Liu Y. Triplett L. Miao J. Tokuhisa J. Deblais L. Robinson H. Leach J.E.

The established Notch ligand Delta-like 1 (DLL1), but not DNER, activated Notch1 in a luciferase assay, prevented the differentiation of myoblasts through Notch signaling, and bound Notch-fc in a cell-based assay. DNER is not a Notch ligand and its true function remains unknown."
https://openalex.org/W2519710755,"Nutrients can determine the outcome of the competition between different floating plant species. The response of floating plants to current phosphorus levels may be affected by previously experienced phosphorus concentrations because some species have the ability to store excess phosphorus for later use. This might have an impact on their competition. Here, we investigate the effect of previous and actual phosphorus concentrations on the growth rate of free-floating plant species (Azolla filiculoides, Lemna minor/gibba and Ricciocarpus natans)and the effect of phosphorus history on the competition between L. minor/gibba and A. filiculoides and between L. minor/gibba and R. natans. As expected, plant growth was lower when previously kept at low instead of high phosphorus concentrations. Growth of L. minor/gibba and A. filiculoides with a phosphorus rich history was comparable for low and high actual phosphorus concentrations, however, internal phosphorus concentrations were significantly lower with low actual phosphorus concentration. This indicates that both species perform luxury phosphorus uptake. Furthermore, internal P concentration in Azolla and Lemna increased within two weeks after a period of P deficit without a strong increase in growth. A. filiculoides in a mixture with L. minor/gibba grew faster than its monoculture. Morphological differences may explain why A. filiculoides outcompeted L. minor/gibba and these differences may be induced by phosphorus concentrations in the past. Growth of L. minor/gibba was only reduced by the presence of A. filiculoides with a high phosphorus history. Growth of L. minor/gibba and R. natans in mixtures was positively affected only when they had a high phosphorus history themselves and their competitor a low phosphorus history. These observations clearly indicate that phosphorus history of competing plants is important for understanding the outcome of the competition. Therefore, actual and previously experienced phosphorus concentrations should be taken into account in future studies dealing with competition between plants."
https://openalex.org/W2521017306,"The aim of this study was to investigate the time-course of changes in choroidal thickness (ChT) following complete mydriasis induced by compound tropicamide.ChT was measured by OCT with the enhanced-depth imaging technique (Spectralis HRA+OCT, Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) at nine locations of the fundus: subfoveal ChT (SFChT) and ChT at 1 mm and 3 mm from the fovea in four quadrants. Mydriasis was induced with compound tropicamide (0.5% tropicamide plus 0.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride, three doses at 5-minute intervals). Measurements were conducted prior to the instillation and at 0, 30, and 60 min following complete mydriasis. Results at different time-points were compared using repeated-measures ANOVA to investigate the time-course of the changes.Thirty-nine subjects (mean age 11.9±2 years; 16 males and 23 females) were enrolled in the study. Compound tropicamide resulted in a statistically significant decrease in SFChT at 0, 30, and 60 min after complete mydriasis, as compared to baseline (-5±4 μm, -12±4 μm, and -13±4 μm, respectively; all P<0.0001). No significant changes were detected in the parafoveal choroid except at 1 mm temporal (T1mm) and nasal (N1mm) to the fovea at 30 and 60 min (T1mm: -6±4 μm and -7±5 μm at 30 and 60 min; N1mm: -6±4 μm and -7±5 μm at 30 and 60 min, respectively; all P<0.0001). Repeated-measures ANOVA showed a significant interaction between the time after complete mydriasis and the effect of the mydriasis agent.Complete mydriasis induced by compound tropicamide led to choroidal thinning, and the magnitude varied over time."
https://openalex.org/W2519598236,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can result in extensive tissue damage in the skin and, in advanced cases, internal organs. Vasculopathy, aberrant immune activation, and tissue fibrosis are three hallmarks of the disease that have been identified, with vasculopathy and aberrant immunity being amongst the earliest events. However, a mechanistic link between these processes has not been established. Here, we have identified a novel role of platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB)/PDGFRβ activation in combination with dermal injury induced by bleomycin as a driver of early, aberrant expression of interferon stimulatory genes (ISGs) and inflammatory monocyte infiltration. Activation of PDGFRβ in combination with bleomycin-induced dermal injury resulted in increased dermal thickness, vascular density, monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and exacerbation of tissue injury. Many of these features were dependent on IFNAR-signaling, and an increase in the number of interferon-beta (IFN-β) producing monocytes cells was found in the skin lesions. Taken together, these results identify a novel link between PDGFRβ activation, and Type I IFN-driven vascular maintenance and monocyte/macrophage cell recruitment, and provide a potential explanation linking key features of SSc that were previously thought to be unrelated."
https://openalex.org/W2520392412,"The mechanism and kinetics underlying reactions between the naturally-occurring antioxidant sinapic acid (SA) and the very damaging ·NO2 and ·OH were investigated through the density functional theory (DFT). Two most possible reaction mechanisms were studied: hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) and radical adduct formation (RAF). Different reaction channels of neutral and anionic sinapic acid (SA-) scavenging radicals in both atmosphere and water medium were traced independently, and the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were calculated. We find the most active site of SA/SA- scavenging ·NO2 and ·OH is the -OH group in benzene ring by HAT mechanism, while the RAF mechanism for SA/SA- scavenging ·NO2 seems thermodynamically unfavorable. In water phase, at 298 K, the total rate constants of SA eliminating ·NO2 and ·OH are 1.30×108 and 9.20×109 M-1 S-1 respectively, indicating that sinapic acid is an efficient scavenger for both ·NO2 and ·OH."
https://openalex.org/W2520828118,"Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is an abundant fishery resource, the harvest levels of which are expected to increase. However, many of the length classes of krill can escape through commonly used commercial trawl mesh sizes. A vital component of the overall management of a fishery is to estimate the total fishing mortality and quantify the mortality rate of individuals that escape from fishing gear. The methods for determining fishing mortality in krill are still poorly developed. We used a covered codend sampling technique followed by onboard observations made in holding tanks to monitor mortality rates of escaped krill. Haul duration, hydrological conditions, maximum fishing depth and catch composition all had no significant effect on mortality of krill escaping 16 mm mesh size nets, nor was any further mortality associated with the holding tank conditions. A non- parametric Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to model the relationship between mortality rates of escapees and time. There was a weak tendency, though not significant, for smaller individuals to suffer higher mortality than larger individuals. The mortality of krill escaping the trawl nets in our study was 4.4 ± 4.4%, suggesting that krill are fairly tolerant of the capture-and-escape process in trawls."
https://openalex.org/W2518841550,"Diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) relies on clinical presentation, parasite isolation, histopathologic evaluation and positive Montenegro skin test. However, the low amounts of parasites in the lesion of these individuals make parasite isolation and histopatologic diagnosis unreliable, often leading to false-negative results. Also, 15% of people living in endemic areas have sub-clinical infection characterized by positive Montenegro skin test, which may contribute to misdiagnosis. Although the main Leishmania killing mechanism is through cell-mediated immune response, antibodies against Leishmania antigens are found in infected individuals. Here our goal was to develop a new serological technique using polystyrene microspheres sensitized with soluble Leishmania antigens as a tool for the detection of IgG in serum from CL patients by flow cytometry. To validate the assay we carried out a comparative test (ELISA) commonly used as a diagnostic test for parasitic diseases. To determine cross-reactivity we used serum from patients with Chagas disease, caused by a trypanosome that has several proteins with high homology to those of the Leishmania genus. We observed that the flow cytometry technique was more sensitive than the ELISA, but, less specific. Our results show that the flow cytometry serologic test can be used to confirm CL cases in L. braziliensis transmission areas, however, presence of Chagas disease has to be ruled out in these individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2520427637,"Purposes The objectives of this paper are to study the impact of low level isopropyl alcohol exposure on blood pressure and to explore its potential mechanism. Methods This cross-sectional study was based on a prospective occupational cohort in south China, which focusing on occupational risk factors related cardiovascular health problems. A total of 283 participants (200 low isopropyl alcohol exposed workers and 83 controls) was finally enrolled in this study. Linear regression models were used to analyze the relationship between arterial blood pressures and low level isopropyl alcohol exposure. We used mediation method to explore possible mediated roles of neurogenic factors. Results Systolic blood pressure (SBP, 123±10 vs. 118±11), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, 79±7 vs. 74±7) and mean blood pressure (MBP, 93±8 vs. 89±9) were different between the exposed group and the control group (p < 0.01). After adjusting for covariates, the difference was still significant. Besides, isopropyl alcohol and smoking had an interactive effect on DBP and MBP (p < 0.05). Furthermore, we observed a mediated effect of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) on isopropyl alcohol exposure induced arterial blood pressure increase, which accounted for about 25%. Conclusions Our results suggest that low level isopropyl alcohol exposure is a potential risk factor for the increased arterial blood pressure and 5-HIAA partly mediates the association between low level isopropyl alcohol exposure and arterial blood pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2519887441,"The mouse intracellular pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1) gene plays important roles in mediating host immunity and previous work showed that it enhances macrophage apoptosis upon mycobacterium infection. However, to date, little is known about the regulation pattern of Ipr1 action. Recent studies have investigated the protein-coding genes and microRNAs regulated by Ipr1 in mouse macrophages, but the structure and the functional motif of the Ipr1 protein have yet to be explored. In this study, we analyzed the domains and functional motif of the Ipr1 protein. The resulting data reveal that Ipr1 protein forms a homodimer and that the Sp100-like domain mediates the targeting of Ipr1 protein to nuclear dots (NDs). Moreover, we found that an Ipr1 mutant lacking the classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS) also translocated into the nuclei, suggesting that the cNLS is not the only factor that directs Ipr1 nuclear localization. Additionally, mechanistic studies revealed that an arginine/lysine-rich element within the DNA-binding domain (SAND domain) is critical for Ipr1 binding to the importin protein receptor NPI-1, demonstrating that this element plays an essential role in mediating the nuclear localization of Ipr1 protein. Furthermore, our results show that this arginine/lysine-rich element contributes to the transcriptional regulation and apoptotic activity of Ipr1. These findings highlight the structural foundations of Ipr1 action and provide new insights into the mechanism of Ipr1-mediated resistance to mycobacterium."

Histological findings and data of an autopsy of a PXE-patient suggest a possible pulmonal calcification. So far, there exists no clinical data whether PXE patients actually are at high risk of developing pulmonary disorder.In a cross-sectional study, 35 PXE patients and 15 healthy controls underwent a pulmonary function testing, including spirometry, body plethysmography and carbon monoxide diffusing test. Additionally, PXE patients completed a COPD-Assessment-Test (CAT).We observed in PXE patients normal values for predicted vital capacity (VC%; 96.0±13.0%), predicted total lung capacity (TLC%; 98.2±12.0%) and predicted forced expiration volume (FEV1%; 102.5±15.6%), whereas compared to healthy controls the PXE group showed significant diminished values for carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO, 7.2 ±1.4mmol/min/kPa vs. 8.6 ±1.5 mmol/min/kPa; p = 0.008) and predicted carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO%; 79.7±11.5% vs. 87.2±6.6%; p = 0.008). 11/35 (31.4%) PXE patients showed pathological DLCO% values under 75% (68.5%±5.4%).PXE patients demonstrated a regular lung function testing, but nevertheless they had impaired CO diffusing parameters, which might be associated with a preclinical state of an interstitial lung disease and a risk for restrictive ventilation disorders."

However, the role of XPA polymorphisms in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. Thus, we analyzed the association of XPA polymorphisms with OSCC risk, clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in the present study. TaqMan genotyping was used to evaluate the frequency of rs10817938, rs2808668 polymorphisms in OSCC patients. The prognostic significance of these polymorphisms was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves, Log-Rank analyses, and the Cox proportional hazard model. Luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and western blot were used to determine whether rs10817938 could influence transcription activity and XPA expression. The results showed that individuals carrying TC and CC genotypes had significantly greater risk of developing OSCC (OR = 1.42, 95% CI 1.04-1.93; OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.32-5.71, respectively) when compared with wild-type TT genotype at rs10817938. OSCC patients with C allele at rs10817938 were more susceptible to lymph metastases, poor pathological differentiation and late TNM stage (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.17-2.37; OR = 1.64, 95% CI 1.18-2.28; OR = 1.54, 95% CI 1.11-2.14; respectively). A significant gene-environment interaction between smoking and CC genotype at rs10817938 was observed (COR = 3.60, 95% CI 1.20-10.9) and data also showed that OSCC patients with CC genotype and C allele had worse survival (p<0.001 for both). The T to C substitution at rs10817938 significantly decreased transcription activity of XPA gene, XPA mRNA and protein were also decreased in individuals with C allele at rs10817938. In addition, no significant association of rs2808668 polymorphism with OSCC risk, prognosis could be observed. In conclusion, the present study showed that XPA rs10817938 polymorphism is a functional SNP in vitro and in vivo and a biomarker for poor prognosis in OSCC patients."

Molecular characterization of rubella virus (RUBV) is important for disease surveillance and for monitoring elimination of the disease throughout the world. We describe the first complete series of data regarding the circulation of RUBV genotypes in Spain. The 739-nucleotide fragment designated by the WHO for RUBV genotyping was sequenced in 88 selected cases collected from 1998 to 2014. Five genotypes were identified: 1E, 2B, 1J, 1I, and 1a. Genotype 1E was predominant between 1998 and 2003 but was replaced by genotype 2B, which was detected in sporadic cases in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. There was an outbreak of genotype 2B in Algeciras (Andalusia) in 2008. Genotype 1J caused an outbreak in Madrid in 2004/2005 and sporadic cases in 2005 and 2007. Genotype 1I was found to have infected an immune-suppressed patient with neurological symptoms in 2008. Finally, vaccine strain RA 27/3 was detected in three sporadic cases, two of them immune-suppressed and without a recent history of vaccination. This suggests that during these years there were a series of imported sporadic cases and outbreaks, confirming the findings of epidemiological data analysis. The importation sources were generally consistent with our geographic and cultural ties, mainly with Europe (genotypes 1E, 2B, 1I) and Latin America (1J)."

The study aims to evaluate the LA expansion index (LAEI) for predicting diastolic heart failure (HF) in patients with severe left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction.This prospective study enrolled 162 patients (65% male) with preserved LV systolic function and severe diastolic dysfunction (132 grade 2 patients, 30 grade 3 patients). All patients had sinus rhythm at enrollment. The LAEI was calculated as (Volmax - Volmin) x 100% / Volmin, where Volmax was defined as maximal LA volume and Volmin was defined as minimal volume. The endpoint was hospitalization for HF withp reserved LV ejection fraction (HFpEF).The median follow-up duration was 2.9 years. Fifty-four patients had cardiovascular events, including 41 diastolic and 8 systolic HF hospitalizations. In these 54 patients, 13 in-hospital deaths and 5 sudden out-of-hospital deaths occurred. Multivariate analyses revealed that HFpEF was associated with LAEI.and atrial fibrillation during follow-up. For predicting HFpEF, the LAEI had a hazard ratio of 1.197per 10% decrease. In patients who had HFpEF events, the LAEI significantly (P< 0.0001) decreased from 69±18% to 39±11% during hospitalization. Although the LAEI improved during follow-up (53±13%), it did not return to baseline.The LAEI predicts HFpEF in patients with severe diastolic dysfunction; it worsens during HFpEF events and partially recovers during followup."
https://openalex.org/W2519063033,"Porous protein cages are supramolecular protein self-assemblies presenting pores that allow the access of surrounding molecules and ions into their core in order to store and transport them in biological environments. Protein cages' pores are attractive channels for the internalisation of inorganic nanoparticles and an alternative for the preparation of hybrid bioinspired nanoparticles. However, strategies based on nanoparticle transport through the pores are largely unexplored, due to the difficulty of tailoring nanoparticles that have diameters commensurate with the pores size and simultaneously displaying specific affinity to the cages' core and low non-specific binding to the cages' outer surface. We evaluated the specific internalisation of single small gold nanoparticles, 3.9 nm in diameter, into porous protein cages via affinity binding. The E2 protein cage derived from the Geobacillus stearothermophilus presents 12 pores, 6 nm in diameter, and an empty core of 13 nm in diameter. We engineered the E2 protein by site-directed mutagenesis with oligohistidine sequences exposing them into the cage's core. Dynamic light scattering and electron microscopy analysis show that the structures of E2 protein cages mutated with bis- or penta-histidine sequences are well conserved. The surface of the gold nanoparticles was passivated with a self-assembled monolayer made of a mixture of short peptidols and thiolated alkane ethylene glycol ligands. Such monolayers are found to provide thin coatings preventing non-specific binding to proteins. Further functionalisation of the peptide coated gold nanoparticles with Ni2+ nitrilotriacetic moieties enabled the specific binding to oligohistidine tagged cages. The internalisation via affinity binding was evaluated by electron microscopy analysis. From the various mutations tested, only the penta-histidine mutated E2 protein cage showed repeatable and stable internalisation. The present work overcomes the limitations of currently available approaches and provides a new route to design tailored and well-controlled hybrid nanoparticles."

Subjects underwent complete ophthalmological examination including fluoroscein angiography (FA), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and multifocal electroretinogram (mf-ERG). All subjects received single 1.25 mg/0.05ml IVB injection. Two observers measured all parameters; inter-observer agreements were expressed as kappa values. Paired t-test was used to compare values at baseline and follow-up. The statistical analysis was done using SPSS for Windows, Version 14.0. (Chicago, SPSS Inc.) Presenting mean CFT (central foveal thickness) was 499.5(+/-229.7) μm, mean BCVA (best corrected visual acuity) was 0.64(+/-0.41) logMAR.

However, whether ischemic adverse effects will emerge with repeated IVB injections as a consequence of cumulative dosing needs further investigation. The setting of our study being a tertiary care centre, the numbers of fresh BRVO cases without prior intervention were limited. Thus, the limitations of our study include a small sample size with a small follow-up period. No major ocular/systemic adverse event was observed in the study period.No evidence of progressive ischaemia attributable to single bevacizumab treatment was observed in this study. However, a larger prospective study involving subjects with cumulative dosing of bevacizumab and a longer follow-up could provide a better understanding of the potential ischaemic effects of bevacizumab or other anti-VEGF agents."

An epidural loading dose of a mixture of 6 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine and 2 mg morphine was administered 30 min before the end of surgery, and PCEA was initiated using 1.25 mg/mL ropivacaine and 0.05 mg/mL morphine with a 2-mL/h background infusion and 2-mL bolus with a 15-min lockout. The primary end point of this study was the quantification of the PCEA-sparing effect of parecoxib.Demographic data were similar between the two groups. Patients in the parecoxib group received significantly fewer self-administrated boluses (0 (0, 3) vs. 7 (2, 15), P < 0.001) and less epidural morphine (5.01 ± 0.44 vs. 5.95 ± 1.29 mg, P < 0.001) but experienced greater pain relief compared with the control group (P < 0.001). Patient global satisfaction was higher in the parecoxib group than the control group (P < 0.001).

Study Design Retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center. Methods Between 2010 and 2015, 8 patients who had undergone EETSA surgery displayed postoperative ISM. The comparison group consisted of 147 patients who underwent the same surgical procedures and were diagnosed with the same diseases. Pre- or postoperative paranasal sinus computed tomography (PNS CT) and VAS were performed and subsequently analyzed. Results The clinical features of ISM of the sphenoid sinus showed sellar floor invagination and regenerated inverted ingrowing sphenoid mucosa on endoscopic imaging. PNS CT also showed a bony defect and invaginated air densities at the sellar turcica. Pre- and postoperative VAS scores revealed that the ISM group had much less of an improvement in headaches after surgery than that of the comparison group (p = 0.049). Conclusion ISM may occur because of a change in pressure, sphenoid mucosal status, or arachnoid membrane status. Moreover, ISM is related to improvements in headaches. Therefore, EETSA patients should avoid activities that cause rapid pressure changes during the healing process. In addition, sellar reconstruction that is resistant to physical pressure changes should be mandated despite the absence of an intraoperative CSF leak."

Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were obtained, and the contours of 15 organs were drawn. The Taiwanese reference man (TRM) and Taiwanese reference woman (TRW) were constructed. For the SAF calculation, the differences in the self-absorption SAF (self-SAF) between the TRM, TRW, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) adult phantom were less than 10% when the difference in organ mass was less than 20%. The average SAF from liver to pancreas of TRM was 38% larger than that of the ORNL adult phantom, and the result of TRW was 2.02 times higher than that of the ORNL adult phantom. For the S-value calculation, the ratios of TRW and ORNL adult phantom ranged from 0.91 to 1.57, and the ratios of TRM and ORNL adult phantom ranged from 1.04 to 2.29. The SAF and S-value results were dominantly affected by the height, weight, organ mass, and geometric relationship between organs.

https://openalex.org/W2519658998,"The dynamic and differential regulation and expression of genes is majorly governed by the complex interactions of a subset of biomolecules in the cell operating at multiple levels starting from genome organisation to protein post-translational regulation. The regulatory layer contributed by the epigenetic layer has been one of the favourite areas of interest recently. This layer of regulation as we know today largely comprises of DNA modifications, histone modifications and noncoding RNA regulation and the interplay between each of these major components. Epigenetic regulation has been recently shown to be central to development of a number of disease processes. The availability of datasets of high-throughput screens for molecules for biological properties offer a new opportunity to develop computational methodologies which would enable in-silico screening of large molecular libraries.In the present study, we have used data from high throughput screens for the inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers. Computational predictive models were constructed based on the molecular descriptors. Machine learning algorithms for supervised training, Naive Bayes and Random Forest, were used to generate predictive models for the small molecule inhibitors of histone methyl-transferases and demethylases. Random forest, with the accuracy of 80%, was identified as the most accurate classifier. Further we complemented the study with substructure search approach filtering out the probable pharmacophores from the active molecules leading to drug molecules.We show that effective use of appropriate computational algorithms could be used to learn molecular and structural correlates of biological activities of small molecules. The computational models developed could be potentially used to screen and identify potential new biological activities of molecules from large molecular libraries and prioritise them for in-depth biological assays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and most comprehensive computational analysis towards understanding activities of small molecules inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers."
