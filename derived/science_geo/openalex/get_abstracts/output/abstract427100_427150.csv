https://openalex.org/W2093500494,"Malignant breast tissue contains a rare population of multi-potent cells with the capacity to self-renew; these cells are known as cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) or tumor-initiating cells. Primitive mammary CSCs/progenitor cells can be propagated in culture as floating spherical colonies termed 'mammospheres'. We show here that the expression of the autophagy protein Beclin 1 is higher in mammospheres established from human breast cancers or breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and BT474) than in the parental adherent cells. As a result, autophagic flux is more robust in mammospheres. We observed that basal and starvation-induced autophagy flux is also higher in aldehyde dehydrogenase 1-positive (ALDH1(+)) population derived from mammospheres than in the bulk population. Beclin 1 is critical for CSC maintenance and tumor development in nude mice, whereas its expression limits the development of tumors not enriched with breast CSCs/progenitor cells. We found that decreased survival in autophagy-deficient cells (MCF-7 Atg7 knockdown cells) during detachment does not contribute to an ultimate deficiency in mammosphere formation. This study demonstrates that a prosurvival autophagic pathway is critical for CSC maintenance, and that Beclin 1 plays a dual role in tumor development."
https://openalex.org/W2090281724,"Divalent metal-ion transporter-1 (DMT1) is a H(+)-coupled metal-ion transporter that plays essential roles in iron homeostasis. DMT1 exhibits reactivity (based on evoked currents) with a broad range of metal ions; however, direct measurement of transport is lacking for many of its potential substrates. We performed a comprehensive substrate-profile analysis for human DMT1 expressed in RNA-injected Xenopus oocytes by using radiotracer assays and the continuous measurement of transport by fluorescence with the metal-sensitive PhenGreen SK fluorophore. We provide validation for the use of PhenGreen SK fluorescence quenching as a reporter of cellular metal-ion uptake. We determined metal-ion selectivity under fixed conditions using the voltage clamp. Radiotracer and continuous measurement of transport by fluorescence assays revealed that DMT1 mediates the transport of several metal ions that were ranked in selectivity by using the ratio I(max)/K(0.5) (determined from evoked currents at -70 mV): Cd(2+) > Fe(2+) > Co(2+), Mn(2+) ≫ Zn(2+), Ni(2+), VO(2+). DMT1 expression did not stimulate the transport of Cr(2+), Cr(3+), Cu(+), Cu(2+), Fe(3+), Ga(3+), Hg(2+), or VO(+). (55)Fe(2+) transport was competitively inhibited by Co(2+) and Mn(2+). Zn(2+) only weakly inhibited (55)Fe(2+) transport. Our data reveal that DMT1 selects Fe(2+) over its other physiological substrates and provides a basis for predicting the contribution of DMT1 to intestinal, nasal, and pulmonary absorption of metal ions and their cellular uptake in other tissues. Whereas DMT1 is a likely route of entry for the toxic heavy metal cadmium, and may serve the metabolism of cobalt, manganese, and vanadium, we predict that DMT1 should contribute little if at all to the absorption or uptake of zinc. The conclusion in previous reports that copper is a substrate of DMT1 is not supported."

The conventional mechanistic interpretation of the synergism between randomly acting endoglucanases (EGs) and chain end-specific processive cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) is that EG-generated new chain ends on cellulose surface serve as starting points for CBHs. Here we studied the hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose (BC) by CBH TrCel7A and EG TrCel5A from Trichoderma reesei under both single-turnover and “steady state” conditions. Unaccountable by conventional interpretation, the presence of EG increased the rate constant of TrCel7A-catalyzed hydrolysis of BC in steady state. At optimal enzyme/substrate ratios, the “steady state” rate of synergistic hydrolysis became limited by the velocity of processive movement of TrCel7A on BC. A processivity value of 66 ± 7 cellobiose units measured for TrCel7A on 14C-labeled BC was close to the leveling off degree of polymerization of BC, suggesting that TrCel7A cannot pass through the amorphous regions on BC and stalls. We propose a mechanism of endo-exo synergism whereby the degradation of amorphous regions by EG avoids the stalling of TrCel7A and leads to its accelerated recruitment. Hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw suggested that this mechanism of synergism is operative also in the degradation of lignocellulose. Although both mechanisms of synergism are used in parallel, the contribution of conventional mechanism is significant only at high enzyme/substrate ratios.

Cellulose is the most abundant biopolymer on Earth and has great potential as a renewable energy source (1.Ragauskas A.J. Williams C.K. Davison B.H. Britovsek G. Cairney J. Eckert C.A.

The path forward for biofuels and biomaterials.Science. 2006; 311: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (4704) Google Scholar). Cellulose is the main component of plant cell walls, but it is also produced by some animals and microorganisms like bacteria and algae. Cellulose consists of linear chains of anhydroglucose units linked through β-1-4 glycosidic bonds. Degree of polymerization (DP) 2The abbreviations used are: DPdegree of polymerizationACamorphous celluloseBCbacterial celluloseCBcellobiose14CB14C-labeled cellobiose14C-BC14C-labeled bacterial celluloseCBHcellobiohydrolaseCBMcarbohydrate binding moduleTrCel7ACBH Cel7A from T. reeseiTrCel5AEG Cel5A from T. reeseiCDTrCel7Acatalytic domain of TrCel7ADSEdegree of synergistic effectEGendoglucanaseMU4-methylumbelliferoneMUL4-methylumbelliferyl-β-lactosidepNPpara-nitrophenolpNPLpara-nitrophenol-β-lactoside. in native celluloses ranges from a few thousand to tens of thousands of glucose units. Linear chains interact with each other, forming tightly packed crystalline structures like microfibrils and fibers. In plant cell walls, cellulose is associated with other polysaccharides like hemicelluloses and heterogeneous polymer of phenolic units, lignin. All of this makes cellulose recalcitrant for enzymatic as well as chemical breakdown (2.Himmel M.E. Ding S.Y. Johnson D.K. Adney W.S. Nimlos M.R. Brady J.W. Foust T.D. Biomass recalcitrance: engineering plants and enzymes for biofuels production.Science. 2007; 315: 804-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar, 3.Chundawat S.P. Beckham G.T. Himmel M.E. Dale B.E. Deconstruction of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and chemicals.Annu. Rev. Chem. Biomol. Eng. 2011; 2: 121-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). In nature, cellulose is degraded mainly by fungi and bacteria, which secrete a set of cellulolytic enzymes (4.Lynd L.R. Weimer P.J. van Zyl W.H. Pretorius I.S. Microbial cellulose utilization. Fundamentals and biotechnology.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2002; 66: 506-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (3541) Google Scholar). These include cellulases and hemicellulases but also enzymes involved in lignin breakdown. The simplest classification groups cellulases into cellobiohydrolases (CBHs), endoglucanases (EGs) and β-glucosidases. CBHs are processive enzymes that start the hydrolysis from cellulose chain ends, whereas EGs non-processively attack cellulose chains at random positions. β-Glucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose, the product of the action of CBHs, to glucose, thus relieving the product inhibition of CBHs. To date, the best characterized cellulolytic system is that of soft rot fungus Tricoderma reesei. The major component of the T. reesei cellulolytic system is glycoside hydrolase family 7 (CAZy database, available on the World Wide Web) (6.Cantarel B.L. Coutinho P.M. Rancurel C. Bernard T.

TrCel7A has a modular structure consisting of a catalytic domain that is connected through the linker peptide (7.Srisodsuk M. Reinikainen T. Penttilä M. Teeri T.T.

Fine tuning polysaccharide recognition.Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). The tunnel-shaped active site resides in the catalytic domain and contains 10 anhydroglucose unit binding sites (9.Divne C. Ståhlberg J. Teeri T.T. Jones T.A. High resolution crystal structures reveal how a cellulose chain is bound in the 50-Å-long tunnel of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma reesei.J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 309-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). It is well documented that CBM is required for efficient binding of TrCel7A to the crystalline cellulose (10.Tomme P.

CBMs have also targeting function (11.Carrard G. Koivula A. Söderlund H. Béguin P. Cellulose-binding domains promote hydrolysis of different sites on crystalline cellulose.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Although molecular dynamics simulations have predicted more intimate roles for CBM in catalysis like disengagement of cellulose chains from the crystal lattice (15.Mulakala C. Reilly P.J.

Besides TrCel7A, T. reesei also secretes a less abundant CBH, TrCel6A, and a number of EGs that include TrCel7B, TrCel5A, and TrCel12A. The active site of EGs is more opened and groove-shaped. It is well recognized that CBHs are more efficient in degradation of crystalline cellulose, whereas EGs preferentially target less ordered amorphous regions. degree of polymerization amorphous cellulose bacterial cellulose cellobiose 14C-labeled cellobiose 14C-labeled bacterial cellulose cellobiohydrolase carbohydrate binding module CBH Cel7A from T. reesei EG Cel5A from T. reesei catalytic domain of TrCel7A degree of synergistic effect endoglucanase 4-methylumbelliferone 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-lactoside para-nitrophenol para-nitrophenol-β-lactoside. Synergistic cooperation between cellulases is a prerequisite for efficient degradation of cellulose (18.Woodward J. Synergism in cellulase systems.Bioresour. Technol. 1991; 36: 67-75Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 19.Kostylev M. Wilson D. Synergistic interactions in cellulose hydrolysis.Biofuels. 2012; 3: 61-70Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The first mechanistic explanation of synergism was put forward by Reese et al. (20.Reese E.T. Siu R.G. Levinson H.S. The biological degradation of soluble cellulose derivatives and its relationship to the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis.J. Bacteriol. 1950; 59: 485-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) more than 50 years ago. The first, unknown component (C1) was supposed to carry out so-called amorphogenesis of crystalline cellulose, exposing single cellulose chains and cellooligosaccharides that were then degraded by the Cx component, identified as EG (20.Reese E.T. Siu R.G. Levinson H.S. The biological degradation of soluble cellulose derivatives and its relationship to the mechanism of cellulose hydrolysis.J. Bacteriol. 1950; 59: 485-497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although numerous non-hydrolytic proteins that can induce amorphogenesis and act synergistically with cellulases have been identified (21.Arantes V. Saddler J.N. Access to cellulose limits the efficiency of enzymatic hydrolysis. The role of amorphogenesis.Biotechnol. Biofuels. 2010; 3: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), their contribution to lignocellulose degradation remains elusive. After discovery of CBHs (referred to as C1 for some time) (22.Storvick W.O. King K.W. The complexity and mode of action of the cellulase system of Cellvibrio gilvus.J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Selby K. Maitland C.C. The cellulase of Trichoderma viride. Separation of the components involved in the solubilization of cotton.Biochem. J. 1967; 104: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), the mechanistic explanation of endo-exo synergy was put forward, whereby randomly acting EG generates new chain ends on cellulose that serve as starting points for processive CBHs (24.Wood T.M. McCrae S.I. The purification and properties of the C1 component of Trichoderma koningii cellulase.Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Although alternative explanations like removal of obstacles by EG (surface “cleaning”) to aid the processive movement of CBH have also been proposed (25.Väljamäe P. Sild V. Nutt A. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Acid hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose reveals different modes of synergistic action between cellobiohydrolase I and endoglucanase I.Eur. J.

Biotechnol. 2002; 101: 41-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), the conventional “starting point generation” mechanism is still the most widely accepted one. Synergistic action has been shown to be reciprocal, meaning that not only does CBH benefit from the action of EG, but also the action of CBH renders the substrate more accessible to EG (25.Väljamäe P. Sild V. Nutt A. Pettersson G. Johansson G. Acid hydrolysis of bacterial cellulose reveals different modes of synergistic action between cellobiohydrolase I and endoglucanase I.Eur. J.

Synergism between two CBHs (exo-exo synergism) has also been reported (28.Fägerstam L.G. Pettersson L.G. The 1,4-β-glucan cellobiohydrolases of Trichoderma reesei QM 9414.

Because one of the CBH components has been proposed to employ also the endo-mode of initiation (endo-processive CBH), the mechanistic interpretation of the conventional endo-exo synergism was adopted (30.Medve J. Ståhlberg J. Tjerneld F. Adsorption and synergism of cellobiohydrolase I and II of Trichoderma reesei during hydrolysis of microcrystalline cellulose.Biotechnol.

Recently, a new type of synergism between enzymes that employ oxidative chemistry to break glycosidic bonds and hydrolytic enzymes was reported in chitin degradation (33.Vaaje-Kolstad G. Westereng B.

The enigmatic synergism between non-hydrolytic glycoside hydrolase family 61 proteins and cellulases has since found a mechanistic interpretation (34.Harris P.V. Welner D. McFarland K.C. Re E.

For the quantitative description of synergism, the degree of synergistic effect (DSE) is often used. DSE is the ratio of the activity of synergistic mixture to the sum of the activities of individual components. Besides the nature of synergistic components, DSE has also been shown to depend on the molar ratio of the components (31.Boisset C. Pétrequin C. Chanzy H. Henrissat B. Schülein M.

All of these findings indicate that endo-exo synergism is far more complex than appears from the conventional, “starting point generation” mechanism. Here we studied the hydrolysis of BC by CBH TrCel7A and EG TrCel5A under both single-turnover and “steady state” conditions. EG was found to increase the rate constant of CBH-catalyzed cellulose hydrolysis in “steady state.” A mechanism of endo-exo synergism is proposed, whereby the degradation of amorphous regions of BC by EG avoids the stalling of processive CBH and leads to its accelerated recruitment.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expected to participate in the molecular network that controls this process. The composition of this network is, however, still undefined. Elucidating the complement of miRNAs that regulate APP expression should reveal novel drug targets capable of modulating Aβ production in AD. Here, we investigated the contribution of miR-153 to this regulatory network. A miR-153 target site within the APP 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) was predicted by several bioinformatic algorithms. We found that miR-153 significantly reduced reporter expression when co-transfected with an APP 3′-UTR reporter construct. Mutation of the predicted miR-153 target site eliminated this reporter response. miR-153 delivery in both HeLa cells and primary human fetal brain cultures significantly reduced APP expression. Delivery of a miR-153 antisense inhibitor to human fetal brain cultures significantly elevated APP expression. miR-153 delivery also reduced expression of the APP paralog APLP2. High functional redundancy between APP and APLP2 suggests that miR-153 may target biological pathways in which they both function. Interestingly, in a subset of human AD brain specimens with moderate AD pathology, miR-153 levels were reduced. This same subset also exhibited elevated APP levels relative to control specimens. Therefore, endogenous miR-153 inhibits expression of APP in human neurons by specifically interacting with the APP 3′-UTR. This regulatory interaction may have relevance to AD etiology, where low miR-153 levels may drive increased APP expression in a subset of AD patients.

Aβ is derived from its parental molecule, Aβ precursor protein (APP), during a series of processing steps that result in the liberation of various soluble fragments (4Thinakaran G. Koo E.H.

Internal cleavage by the β-secretase enzyme (β site APP-cleaving enzyme; BACE1) initiates Aβ production by cleaving APP at the Aβ N terminus, releasing a truncated secreted β form of APP. Cleavage by the γ-secretase complex at the Aβ C terminus results in the release of the soluble Aβ peptide and APP C-terminal fragments. Promiscuous cleavage by the γ-secretase complex results in the release of two C-terminal length variants of the Aβ peptide (Aβ(1–40) and Aβ(1–42)) that are the main constituents of one of the hallmark pathologies of the disease, extracellular neuritic plaques (5Nelson P.T.

Therefore, therapeutic strategies that aim to reduce APP expression may be useful as a means to reduce Aβ production in sporadic AD and normalize APP expression in these more specific forms of the disease. Given the centrality of APP and Aβ to AD pathology, it is imperative to elucidate the various mechanisms that regulate physiological expression of APP as a means to identify novel drug targets for modulating Aβ levels. The regulation of APP expression has been extensively studied, with controls being mediated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The promoter structure is complex (10Song W.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small (18–24 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that interact with target mRNAs and mediate inhibitory controls on protein production (28Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs. Target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). They generally base-pair to sites in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs with imperfect complementarity, with the exception of a region at the 5′ end of an miRNA termed the seed sequence. Studies have shown that nearly perfect complementarity between the seed sequence and target mRNA is required for a functional interaction (29Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P.

Conserved seed pairing, often flanked by adenosines, indicates that thousands of human genes are microRNA targets.Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9836) Google Scholar). miRNAs exist in complex with protein mediators as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (31Pratt A.J.

Chem. 2009; 284: 17897-17901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), with AGO proteins serving as primary core proteins. Interactions between miRNAs and their target mRNAs bring the mRNA in close association with effector proteins that generally inhibit protein production either by transcript destabilization or translational inhibition (32Filipowicz W.

Bartel D.P. Mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels.Nature. 2010; 466: 835-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3108) Google Scholar). We and others have begun to describe the contributions that miRNAs bring to the post-transcriptional control of APP expression (34Long J.M. Lahiri D.K.

However, many additional miRNA target sites are predicted in the APP 3′-UTR. These miRNAs may mediate potent inhibitory effects and participate in the network of molecular regulators that control APP expression. Here, we demonstrate that miR-153 inhibits expression of APP in human primary brain cultures via a specific target site in the APP 3′-UTR and is a participant in the endogenous molecular network that controls physiological APP expression. We further show that miR-153 is dysregulated in a subset of AD patients and that APP levels are inversely dysregulated, suggesting that the regulatory relationship may be relevant to AD pathology. HeLa cells were cultured in minimum essential medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals) and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin solution (Mediatech) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Antibiotics and antimycotics were omitted from the media during all transfections. For co-transfections of DNA constructs and miRNA mimics (Dharmacon), HeLa cells were cultured in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) and transfected with 150 ng of DNA and 40 nm miRNA using 0.2 μl of Transfectin (Bio-Rad). For single transfections of siRNA (Applied Biosystems) or miRNA mimics, HeLa cells were cultured in 24-well plates (1.35 × 105 cells/well) and reverse transfected with 20 nm siRNA or 50 nm miRNA using 0.5 μl of Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen). The luciferase reporter construct was prepared as previously described (36Long J.M. Lahiri D.K.

The amplicon was then inserted into the XhoI site of psiCHECK-2 (Promega), immediately downstream of a Renilla luciferase coding sequence, using the InFusion cloning system (Clontech).

Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the Renilla and firefly luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter system (Promega) on a Turner Biosystems Veritas luminomenter. Ratios of Renilla/firefly luminescence values were calculated and scaled relative to the value for the APP 3′-UTR reporter alone transfection. Primary cultures of mixed human fetal brain cells (HFB) were prepared from the brain parenchyma of aborted fetuses (80–100 days gestational age). The tissues were obtained from the Birth Defects Research Laboratory at the University of Washington with approval from the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. Fetal brain materials (10–20 g) were shipped overnight in chilled Hibernate-E medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen), GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Cellgro). The culture procedures closely followed our previously described protocol (44Ray B. Bailey J.A. Sarkar S. Lahiri D.K. Molecular and immunocytochemical characterization of primary neuronal cultures from adult rat brain. Differential expression of neuronal and glial protein markers.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 184: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the tissues were digested in 0.05% trypsin, 0.53 mm EDTA solution and incubated in a shaking water bath (150 rpm) at 37 °C for 15 min. The trypsin-digested tissues were transferred to Hibernate-E medium and triturated several times using a siliconized, fire-polished pipette followed by centrifugation at 400 × g for 15 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in Hibernate-E medium and triturated once more followed by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in culture medium (see below), and cells were counted by the trypan blue exclusion method. The cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 24-well plates in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 1× B27, 0.5 mm GlutaMAX, 5 ng/ml bFGF (Invitrogen), and antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. Half-medium changes were performed every fourth day of culture. HFB cultures were transfected at day in vitro (DIV) 17 in 24-well plates. One culture batch was transfected with 20 nm siRNA and 150 nm miRNA mimics using 1.25 μl of RNAiMAX. A second culture batch was transfected with 1 μm LNA miRNA inhibitors (Exiqon) using 1.25 μl of RNAiMAX. Antibiotics and bFGF were omitted from media during transfections. Human fetal brain cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with chilled PBS and then permeabilized with 0.12% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min. Permeabilized cells were blocked with 10% horse serum (Atlanta Biologicals) for 15 min followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies. Primary antibodies used in this study include a mouse pan-neuronal antibody mixture (Millipore) active against neurites, neuronal nuclei, and neuronal cell bodies; rabbit anti-GFAP (Sigma) for astrocyte labeling; and rabbit anti-nestin (Sigma) for neural stem cell labeling. Biotin-conjugated donkey anti-mouse (Jackson Immunoresearch) and Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch) secondary antibodies were used as described previously (44Ray B. Bailey J.A. Sarkar S. Lahiri D.K. Molecular and immunocytochemical characterization of primary neuronal cultures from adult rat brain. Differential expression of neuronal and glial protein markers.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 184: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Immunoresearch) was employed to label biotin-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were visualized using Hoechst stain (Sigma), and labeled cells were examined under a Leica DMIL HC inverted fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems). Images were captured using a SPOT RT-SE digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments). For protein analysis by Western blotting, cell lysates were prepared at various time points in culture as indicated in the figure legends. Briefly, cells were first washed with PBS and then lysed on plate with vigorous shaking using mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) supplemented with 0.1% SDS and protease inhibitor mixture set III (Calbiochem). Lysates were centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and cleared lysates were collected. Lysate protein concentrations were then assayed by BCA (Pierce) per the manufacturer's instructions. An equal amount of lysate protein (1–5 μg) was loaded onto BisTris XT denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat milk and then incubated overnight with primary antibodies against APP (22C11, Chemicon), polyclonal C-terminal anti-APLP2 (Calbiochem), α-tubulin (B-5-1-2, Sigma), and β-actin (AC15, Sigma). Membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Rockland Immunochemicals) for 1 h. Bands were visualized using ECL reagent (Pierce), detected on film, and scanned. Levels of Aβ(1–40) were measured in the conditioned media (CM) of HFB cultures using a sensitive and specific commercially available ELISA (IBL America). Briefly, an equal volume of CM (25 μl) was loaded in a plate precoated with anti-human Aβ (35Long J.M. Lahiri D.K.

https://openalex.org/W2046128399,"Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is an effective novel treatment for multiple sclerosis in clinical trials. A reduction of IFN-γ-producing CD4(+) T cells is observed in DMF-treated patients and may contribute to its clinical efficacy. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this clinical observation are unclear. In this study, we investigated the effects of DMF on dendritic cell (DC) maturation and subsequent DC-mediated T cell responses. We show that DMF inhibits DC maturation by reducing inflammatory cytokine production (IL-12 and IL-6) and the expression of MHC class II, CD80, and CD86. Importantly, this immature DC phenotype generated fewer activated T cells that were characterized by decreased IFN-γ and IL-17 production. Further molecular studies demonstrated that DMF impaired nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling via reduced p65 nuclear translocalization and phosphorylation. NF-κB signaling was further decreased by DMF-mediated suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and its downstream kinase mitogen stress-activated kinase 1 (MSK1). MSK1 suppression resulted in decreased p65 phosphorylation at serine 276 and reduced histone phosphorylation at serine 10. As a consequence, DMF appears to reduce p65 transcriptional activity both directly and indirectly by promoting a silent chromatin environment. Finally, treatment of DCs with the MSK1 inhibitor H89 partially mimicked the effects of DMF on the DC signaling pathway and impaired DC maturation. Taken together, these studies indicate that by suppression of both NF-κB and ERK1/2-MSK1 signaling, DMF inhibits maturation of DCs and subsequently Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2106380530,"Antibodies normally do not cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and cannot bind an intracellular cerebral antigen. We demonstrate here for the first time that a new class of antibodies can cross the BBB without treatment. Camelids produce native homodimeric heavy-chain antibodies, the paratope being composed of a single-variable domain called VHH. Here, we used recombinant VHH directed against human glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a specific marker of astrocytes. Only basic VHHs (e.g., pI=9.4) were able to cross the BBB in vitro (7.8 vs. 0% for VHH with pI=7.7). By intracarotid and intravenous injections into live mice, we showed that these basic VHHs are able to cross the BBB in vivo, diffuse into the brain tissue, penetrate into astrocytes, and specifically label GFAP. To analyze their ability to be used as a specific transporter, we then expressed a recombinant fusion protein VHH-green fluorescent protein (GFP). These “fluobodies” specifically labeled GFAP on murine brain sections, and a basic variant (pI=9.3) of the fusion protein VHH-GFP was able to cross the BBB and to label astrocytes in vivo. The potential of VHHs as diagnostic or therapeutic agents in the central nervous system now deserves attention.—Li, T., Bourgeois, J.-P., Celli, S., Glacial, F., Le Sourd, A.-M., Mecheri, S., Weksler, B., Romero, I., Couraud, P.-O., Rougeon, F., and Lafaye, P.

https://openalex.org/W2001997645,"The RB/E2F axis represents a critical node of cell signaling that integrates a diverse array of signaling pathways. Recent evidence has suggested a role for E2F-mediated gene transcription in DNA damage response and repair, as well as apoptosis signaling. Herein, we investigated how repression of E2F activity via CDK4/6 inhibition and RB activation impacts the response of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) to frequently used therapeutic agents. In combination with taxanes and anthracyclines CDK4/6 inhibition and consequent cell cycle arrest prevented the induction of DNA damage and associated cell death in an RB-dependent manner; thereby demonstrating antagonism between the cytostatic influence of the CDK-inhibitor and cytotoxic agents. As many of these effects were secondary to cell cycle arrest, γ-irradiation (IR) was utilized to examine effects of CDK4/6 inhibition on direct DNA damage. Although E2F controls a number of genes involved in DNA repair (e.g. Rad51), CDK4/6 inhibition did not alter the overall rate of DNA repair, rather it significantly shifted the burden of this repair from homologous recombination (HR) to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Together, these data indicate that CDK4/6 inhibition can antagonize cytotoxic therapeutic strategies and increases utilization of error-prone DNA repair mechanisms that could contribute to disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2036951934,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent small noncoding RNAs that play a role in many diseases, including diabetes. miRNAs target genes important for pancreas development, β-cell proliferation, insulin secretion, and exocytosis. Previously, we documented that microRNA-30d (miR-30d), one of miRNAs up-regulated by glucose, induces insulin gene expression in pancreatic β-cells. Here, we found that the induction of insulin production by overexpression of miR-30d is associated with increased expression of MafA, a β-cell-specific transcription factor. Of interest, overexpression of miR-30d prevented the reduction in both MafA and insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) with TNF-α exposure. Moreover, we identified that mitogen-activated protein 4 kinase 4 (MAP4K4), a TNF-α-activated kinase, is a direct target of miR-30d. Overexpression of miR-30d protected β-cells against TNF-α suppression on both insulin transcription and insulin secretion through the down-regulation of MAP4K4 by the miR-30d. A decrease of miR-30d expression was observed in the islets of diabetic db/db mice, in which MAP4K4 expression level was elevated. Our data support the notion that miR-30d plays multiple roles in activating insulin transcription and protecting β-cell functions from impaired by proinflammatory cytokines and underscore the concept that miR-30d may represent a novel pharmacological target for diabetes intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1968354159,"SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) is a member of de-SUMOylation protease family and has an important role in the regulation of androgen receptor-dependent transcription and hypoxia signaling. This activity profile of SENP1 prompted us to investigate whether SENP1 is involved in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. In previous studies, we have detected the overexpression of SENP1 in both precancerous prostate intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) lesions and prostate cancer tissue samples from patients. Whereas our whole-animal model has demonstrated that SENP1 induction is critical for prostate cell transformation, the role of SENP1 in prostate cancer progression is still unknown. In this study, we show that SENP1 expression directly correlates with prostate cancer aggressiveness and reccurrence, by analyzing more than 150 prostate cancer specimens. Modulating SENP1 level dictates colony formation of prostate cancer cell lines, tumor growth in nude mice and also prostate cancer cell migration and invasion. Silencing SENP1 level in highly metastatic prostate cancer cells perturbs their ability to metastasize to the bone and initiates secondary tumors. Mechanistically, the expression of two critical bone remodeling proteins, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and MMP9, is regulated by SENP1 through the HIF1α signaling pathway. All these results show the contribution of SENP1 to the progression of prostate cancer, and suggest that SENP1 may be a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target for metastasis in prostate cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2025175586,"The incidence of extreme precipitation has increased with the exacerbation of worldwide climate disruption. We hypothesize an association between precipitation and the distribution patterns that would affect the endemic burden of 8 infectious diseases in Taiwan, including water- and vector-borne infectious diseases. A database integrating daily precipitation and temperature, along with the infectious disease case registry for all 352 townships in the main island of Taiwan was analysed for the period from 1994 to 2008. Four precipitation levels, <130 mm, 130-200 mm, 200-350 mm and >350 mm, were categorized to represent quantitative differences, and their associations with each specific disease was investigated using the Generalized Additive Mixed Model and afterwards mapped on to the Geographical Information System. Daily precipitation levels were significantly correlated with all 8 mandatory-notified infectious diseases in Taiwan. For water-borne infections, extreme torrential precipitation (>350 mm/day) was found to result in the highest relative risk for bacillary dysentery and enterovirus infections when compared to ordinary rain (<130 mm/day). Yet, for vector-borne diseases, the relative risk of dengue fever and Japanese encephalitis increased with greater precipitation only up to 350 mm. Differential lag effects following precipitation were statistically associated with increased risk for contracting individual infectious diseases. This study's findings can help health resource sector management better allocate medical resources and be better prepared to deal with infectious disease outbreaks following future extreme precipitation events."
https://openalex.org/W2059628641,"κ-Opioid receptor (KOR) agonists do not activate the reward pathway stimulated by morphine-like μ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists and thus have been considered to be promising nonaddictive analgesics. However, KOR agonists produce other adverse effects, including dysphoria, diuresis, and constipation. The therapeutic promise of KOR agonists has nonetheless recently been revived by studies showing that their dysphoric effects require arrestin recruitment, whereas their analgesic effects do not. Moreover, KOR agonist-induced antinociceptive tolerance observed in vivo has also been proposed to be correlated to the ability to induce arrestin-dependent phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization of the receptor. The discovery of functionally selective drugs that are therapeutically effective without the adverse effects triggered by the arrestin pathway is thus an important goal. We have identified such an extreme G protein-biased KOR compound, 6'-guanidinonaltrindole (6'-GNTI), a potent partial agonist at the KOR receptor for the G protein activation pathway that does not recruit arrestin. Indeed, 6'-GNTI functions as an antagonist to block the arrestin recruitment and KOR internalization induced by other nonbiased agonists. As an extremely G protein-biased KOR agonist, 6'-GNTI represents a promising lead compound in the search for nonaddictive opioid analgesic as its signaling profile suggests that it will be without the dysphoria and other adverse effects promoted by arrestin recruitment and its downstream signaling."

At the outer leaflet, membrane-proximal heparan sulfate proteoglycans are involved in a late step of FGF2 secretion resulting in its exposure on cell surfaces (23Nickel W. Unconventional secretion.

These sequential interactions are essential, as experimental conditions that prevent the ability of FGF2 to interact with either PI(4,5)P2 or heparan sulfates cause inhibition of FGF2 secretion (22Temmerman K.

Both of these interactions require FGF2 to be folded properly (26Torrado L.C. Temmerman K. Müller H.M. Mayer M.P. Seelenmeyer C. Backhaus R. Nickel W.

Thus, we previously proposed that FGF2 membrane translocation is not mediated by a classical protein-conducting channel but rather involves some kind of an alternative mechanism of membrane translocation (25Nickel W. The unconventional secretory machinery of fibroblast growth factor 2.Traffic. 2011; 12: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The dependence of this process on a folded conformation has further been interpreted as an intrinsic quality control mechanism of FGF2 secretion (26Torrado L.C. Temmerman K. Müller H.M. Mayer M.P.

Another component of the unconventional secretory machinery of FGF2 is Tec kinase, a protein that was found in a genome-wide RNAi screen designed to identify novel components of FGF2 secretion (29Ebert A.D. Laussmann M. Wegehingel S. Kaderali L. Erfle H. Reichert J. Lechner J. Beer H.D. Pepperkok R. Nickel W. Tec-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor 2 is essential for unconventional secretion.Traffic. 2010; 11: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Tec kinase was demonstrated to phosphorylate FGF2 at tyrosine 82, a modification required for efficient secretion of FGF2 (25Nickel W. The unconventional secretory machinery of fibroblast growth factor 2.Traffic. 2011; 12: 799-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 29Ebert A.D. Laussmann M. Wegehingel S. Kaderali L. Erfle H.

Tec-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor 2 is essential for unconventional secretion.Traffic. 2010; 11: 813-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism by which FGF2 physically traverses the plasma membrane and by which tyrosine phosphorylation affects FGF2 secretion remains unknown. Using biochemical flotation experiments and scanning fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy, we demonstrate that FGF2 oligomerizes in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner at membrane surfaces. Based on membrane passage of small fluorescent tracer molecules and transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids, we find that PI(4,5)P2-dependent oligomerization of FGF2 drives the formation of a lipidic membrane pore (30Qian S. Wang W. Yang L. Huang H.W. Structure of transmembrane pore induced by Bax-derived peptide. Evidence for lipidic pores.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17379-17383Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We further demonstrate that this process is vastly stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation suggesting stabilization of a specific oligomeric conformation of FGF2 with a high potential to trigger the formation of lipidic membrane pores. Diacylglycerol, a membrane lipid with the reverse shape of PI(4,5)P2, inhibited FGF2-dependent pore formation. This finding demonstrates that, in addition to FGF2 oligomerization and tyrosine phosphorylation, positive membrane curvature induced by PI(4,5)P2 is required for this process. Consistent with the observation of transbilayer diffusion of membrane lipids, this finding suggests the formation of a lipidic membrane pore with a putative toroidal architecture. Thus, the reconstitution experiments of this study suggest a novel self-sustained mechanism of membrane translocation with a lipidic membrane pore being a transient translocation intermediate. These findings explain the behavior of FGF2 in living cells where secretion depends on PI(4,5)P2-mediated membrane recruitment (21Nickel W. Seedorf M.

Recombinant FGF2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli using the expression vectors pQE30 (Qiagen) (FGF2-WT and FGF2-PIP2-Mut (K128Q, R129Q, K134Q)) and pET-15b (FGF2-Y82pCMF). In case of FGF2-Y82pCMF, codon 82 (tyrosine) was replaced by an amber stop codon followed by transformation of E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) carrying the plasmid pEVOL-pCMF (31Young T.S. Ahmad I. Yin J.A. Schultz P.G. An enhanced system for unnatural amino acid mutagenesis in E. coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Protein expression was performed in 2× YT medium containing 1 mm p-carboxylmethylphenylalanine (custom synthesis by ENAMINE Ltd.) for 16 h at 25 °C as described (31Young T.S. Ahmad I. Yin J.A. Schultz P.G. An enhanced system for unnatural amino acid mutagenesis in E. coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 395: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). All proteins were His-tagged at the N terminus and were affinity-purified using standard procedures. All lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were from bovine liver; phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 were derived from porcine brain; cholesterol was from ovine wool, and sphingomyelin was from poultry eggs. Diacylglycerol (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycerol), lissamine rhodamine B-labeled PE (16:0), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl]; nickel salt (18:1) were synthetic products. Chloroform-dissolved lipid mixtures were first dried under a gentle nitrogen stream and further dried under vacuum for 1.5 h to yield a homogeneous lipid film. Lipids were resuspended in buffer A (150 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% (w/v) sucrose) at 45 °C to form liposomes with a final lipid concentration of 4 mm (biochemical interaction experiments and transbilayer diffusion experiments) or 8 mm (fluorescence dequenching experiments). Liposomes were subjected to 10 freeze/thaw cycles and 21 size extrusion steps (mini-extruder; Avanti Polar Lipids). Liposome preparations were analyzed by dynamic light scattering, indicating a range 200–400 nm in diameter. Liposomes with a plasma membrane-like lipid composition containing either 2 mol % PI(4,5)P2 or 2 mol % of a Ni-NTA lipid were generated as described earlier (22Temmerman K. Ebert A.D. Müller H.M.

Membranes were blocked with 3% (w/v) fatty acid-free BSA for 1 h at 25 °C and washed with buffer B (25 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.4). Following incubation for 30 min at 25 °C with FGF2-WT, FGF2-Y82pCMF, or FGF2-PIP2-Mut (K128Q, R129Q, and K134Q), liposomes were reisolated by flotation using Nycodenz density gradients (40:30:0% (w/v) in binding buffer) as described in Ref. 33Weber T.

About 2.25% of input, bound and unbound material, was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and Western blotting using anti-FGF2 antibodies. Giant unilamellar vesicles with a plasma membrane-like lipid composition containing either PI(4,5)P2 or a Ni-NTA lipid were generated as described below. His-tagged forms of FGF2-WT and FGF2-Y82pCMF were labeled at cysteines with Atto488 maleimide or Atto655 maleimide dyes as described by the manufacturer (Atto TEC). Unbound dye was removed with Econo-Pac 10DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad). The degree of labeling was determined by mass spectrometry based on relative peak intensities and found to be 90% for FGF2-Y82pCMF for both Atto488 and Atto655, respectively. For FGF2-WT, the labeling efficiency was 80% for Atto488 and 70% for Atto655 (supplemental Fig. S1). Two-focus scanning FCCS measurements were conducted at 22 °C on an LSM710 confocal fluorescence microscope using a C-Apochromat 40 × 1.2 water immersion objective (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Argon ion (488 nm) and HeNe (633 nm) lasers were used for sample excitation. Photon detection was done with the avalanche photodiodes of the ConFocor 3 module, and the photon arrival times were recorded in the photon mode of the hardware correlator Flex 02–01D/C. Measurements were done as described previously (34García-Sáez A.J. Ries J. Orzáez M. Pérez-Payà E. Schwille P. Membrane promotes tBID interaction with BCL(XL).Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Briefly, the detection volume was repeatedly scanned perpendicularly through the equator of a GUV in a frame mode with Nx2 pixels to scan the two parallel lines. Data analysis was performed with software written in MATLAB (34García-Sáez A.J. Ries J. Orzáez M. Pérez-Payà E. Schwille P. Membrane promotes tBID interaction with BCL(XL).Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 1178-1185Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The photon stream was binned in 2-μs bins and arranged as a matrix, with every row corresponding to one line scan. Movements of the membrane were corrected, and auto-correlation and spectral as well as spatial cross-correlation curves were determined. With the structural parameters and the distance between the two scanned lines being known, diffusion coefficients were calculated under the experimental conditions indicated. Irregular curves resulting from instabilities and identified by distortions of the curves and a systematic change in the intensity trace were removed. Cross-correlation was corrected for cross-talk (5%) and for the degree of labeling as described previously (34García-Sáez A.J. Ries J. Orzáez M. Pérez-Payà E. Schwille P.

Liposomes with a plasma membrane-like lipid composition containing 2 mol % PI(4,5)P2 were prepared in buffer A (with a lowered KCl concentration of 100 mm) supplemented with 100 μm of the membrane-impermeant fluorophore 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF; Sigma). To remove extraluminal CF, liposomes were diluted in buffer B and collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 20 °C followed by size exclusion chromatography using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare). Importantly, this column was operated in buffer C (150 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 2% (w/v) glucose) that was titrated with glucose to reach iso-osmolality (840 mosmol/kg). Following incubation with proteins (1 μm) as indicated, fluorescence dequenching was measured using a Gemini XS (Molecular Devices) fluorescence plate reader. At the end of each experiment, Triton X-100 (0.2% (w/v) final concentration) was added to measure the maximum of dequenching that was used to normalize data. Fluorescence dequenching measured in the presence of buffer was considered background and was subtracted from all other measurements. GUVs were prepared at 45 °C in sucrose (300 mosmol/kg) based on the electro-swelling method using platinum electrodes (10 Hz, 1.5 V for 40 min, 2 Hz, 1.5 V for 20 min (34García-Sáez A.J. Ries J.

A plasma membrane-like lipid composition consisting of 30 mol % cholesterol, 15 mol % sphingomyelin, 35 mol % phosphatidylcholine, 10 mol % PE, 5 mol % phosphatidylserine, 5 mol % phosphatidylinositol, and 0.05 mol % rhodamine B-labeled PE was supplemented with either PI(4,5)P2 or a Ni-NTA lipid (2 mol % at the expense of phosphatidylcholine) as indicated. GUVs were incubated with different fluorescent tracer molecules as indicated, Alexa488- (∼1 kDa), dextran-Alexa488- (∼10 kDa), and Alexa488-labeled cytochrome c (∼12 kDa) in buffer B (305 mosmol/kg). Proteins were added to GUVs at a final concentration of 50 nm as indicated. Confocal images were recorded at room temperature in multitrack or single track mode on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal fluorescence microscope using a C-Apochromat 40 × 1.2 water immersion objective. To detect the Alexa 488 dye, samples were excited with an argon ion laser (488 nm), and the light beam was split by a spectral beam guide to 493–536 nm. For rhodamine-PE, samples were excited with a He-Ne laser at 561 nm, and the light beam was split to 581–681 nm. Images were recorded in 8-bit grayscale, pseudo-colored in green (channel 1) and red (channel 2) followed by processing with ImageJ (rsbweb.nih.gov). Luminal fluorescence of individual GUVs (≥300 for each experimental condition) was measured and normalized to the fluorescence intensity of the surrounding buffer. Pyrene-labeled sphingomyelin was solubilized in ethanol (250 μm) and added to preformed liposomes with a diameter of about 100 nm at 5 mol % of total membrane lipids. Samples were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to generate asymmetrically labeled liposomes. Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Jasco FP-6500 spectrofluorometer using quartz cuvettes. Measurements were conducted with an excitation wavelength of 344 nm. Emission wavelengths were 398 nm for monomers, and 474 nm for excimers. Incorporation into the outer membrane leaflet of pyrene-labeled sphingomyelin was determined by the increase of the monomer to excimer ratio at 398 and 474 nm, respectively, as a function of time. The rate of transbilayer lipid diffusion was measured using the method described by Müller et al. (35Müller P. Schiller S. Wieprecht T. Dathe M. Herrmann A. Continuous measurement of rapid transbilayer movement of a pyrene-labeled phospholipid analogue.Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2000; 106: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed at 37 °C under continuous stirring with a final lipid concentration of 20 μm for LUVs. Fluorescence intensities of excimers at 474 nm (IE) and monomers at 398 nm (IM) were determined from spectra taken at various time points after the addition of the various forms of FGF2 indicated. IE/IM ratios at the beginning of the experiment were set to 1. An IE/IM ratio of less than 1 demonstrates diffusion of pyrene-labeled sphingomyelin from the outer to the inner leaflet with IE/IM = 0.5 indicating complete equilibration between the two leaflets. To explore potential mechanisms of FGF2 membrane translocation, we used three different His-tagged variants of FGF2, the wild-type form (FGF2-WT), phosphomimetic FGF2 containing the unnatural amino acid p-carboxylmethylphenylalanine at position 82 (FGF2-Y82pCMF (36Liu C.C.

Two types of liposomes were generated that contained a plasma membrane-like lipid composition supplemented with either PI(4,5)P2 or a Ni-NTA lipid used to recruit His-tagged proteins. Protein binding to liposomes was assessed by flotation gradients combined with an SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, all three proteins bound efficiently to liposomes containing the Ni-NTA lipid (lanes 4, 9, and 14, respectively). By contrast, whereas FGF2-WT and FGF2-Y82pCMF bound efficiently to liposomes containing PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 7, respectively), only trace amounts of FGF2-PIP2-Mut were found associated with these membranes (lane 12). Following binding of FGF2-WT and FGF2-Y82pCMF to PI(4,5)P2-containing liposomes, formation of SDS-resistant oligomers was observed (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 7). Based on migr"
https://openalex.org/W1988315470,"Zinc is an essential mineral, and infants are particularly vulnerable to zinc deficiency as they require large amounts of zinc for their normal growth and development. We have recently described the first loss-of-function mutation (H54R) in the zinc transporter ZnT-2 (SLC30A2) in mothers with infants harboring transient neonatal zinc deficiency (TNZD). Here we identified and characterized a novel heterozygous G87R ZnT-2 mutation in two unrelated Ashkenazi Jewish mothers with infants displaying TNZD. Transient transfection of G87R ZnT-2 resulted in endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi retention, whereas the WT transporter properly localized to intracellular secretory vesicles in HC11 and MCF-7 cells. Consequently, G87R ZnT-2 showed decreased stability compared with WT ZnT-2 as revealed by Western blot analysis. Three-dimensional homology modeling based on the crystal structure of YiiP, a close zinc transporter homologue from Escherichia coli, revealed that the basic arginine residue of the mutant G87R points toward the membrane lipid core, suggesting misfolding and possible loss-of-function. Indeed, functional assays including vesicular zinc accumulation, zinc secretion, and cytoplasmic zinc pool assessment revealed markedly impaired zinc transport in G87R ZnT-2 transfectants. Moreover, co-transfection experiments with both mutant and WT transporters revealed a dominant negative effect of G87R ZnT-2 over the WT ZnT-2; this was associated with mislocalization, decreased stability, and loss of zinc transport activity of the WT ZnT-2 due to homodimerization observed upon immunoprecipitation experiments. These findings establish that inactivating ZnT-2 mutations are an underlying basis of TNZD and provide the first evidence for the dominant inheritance of heterozygous ZnT-2 mutations via negative dominance due to homodimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1992616769,"MicroRNAs have been implicated as important mediators of cancer cell homeostasis, and accumulating data suggest compelling roles for them in the apoptosis pathway. X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent caspase inhibitor and an important barrier to apoptotic cell death, but the mechanisms that determine the diverse range of XIAP expression seen in cancer remains unclear. In this study, we present evidence that miR-24 directly targets the 3'UTR of the XIAP messenger RNA (mRNA) to exert translational repression. Using a heuristic algorithm of bioinformatics analysis and in vitro screening, we identified miR-24 as a candidate regulator of XIAP expression. Array comparative genomic hybridization and spectral karyotype analysis reveal that genomic copy number loss at the miR-24 locus is concordant with the loss of endogenous miR-24 in cancer cells. Using a luciferase construct of the XIAP 3'UTR, we showed that miR-24 specifically coordinates to the XIAP mRNA. Interference with miR-24's binding of the critical seed region, resulting from site-directed mutagenesis of the 3'UTR, significantly abrogated miR-24's effects on XIAP expression. Moreover, miR-24 overexpression can overcome apoptosis resistance in cancer cells via downregulation of XIAP expression, and the resulting cancer cell death induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand is executed by the canonical caspase-mediated apoptosis pathway. In summary, our data suggest a novel mechanism by which miR-24 directly modulates XIAP expression level and consequently the apoptosis threshold in cancer cells."

The conserved core region is flanked by divergent N and C termini, which play a critical role in conferring distinct biological activity on FGFs (3.Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A.

Structural basis by which alternative splicing modulates the organizer activity of FGF8 in the brain.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 185-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). All FGFs interact with pericellular heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycans, albeit with different affinities (30.Asada M. Shinomiya M. Suzuki M. Honda E. Sugimoto R. Ikekita M. Imamura T. Glycosaminoglycan affinity of the complete fibroblast growth factor family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The HS-binding site of FGFs is comprised of the β1-β2 loop and the region between β10 and β12 strands (3.Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Structural basis for fibroblast growth factor receptor activation.Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). HS interacts with both side chain and main chain atoms of the HS-binding site in paracrine FGFs (see Fig. 1A) (31.Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A.

Crystal structure of a ternary FGF-FGFR-heparin complex reveals a dual role for heparin in FGFR binding and dimerization.Mol Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). The HS-binding site of endocrine FGFs deviates from the common conformation adopted by paracrine FGFs such that interaction of HS with backbone atoms of the HS-binding site is precluded (29.Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Yu X. White K.E. Inagaki T. Kliewer S.A. Yamamoto M. Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Kuro-o M. Lanske B.

Biol. 2007; 27: 3417-3428Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). As a result, compared with paracrine FGFs, endocrine FGFs exhibit poor affinity for HS (1.Beenken A. Mohammadi M. The FGF family. Biology, pathophysiology and therapy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2009; 8: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar, 30.Asada M. Shinomiya M. Suzuki M. Honda E. Sugimoto R. Ikekita M. Imamura T. Glycosaminoglycan affinity of the complete fibroblast growth factor family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The poor HS affinity enables these ligands to diffuse freely away from the site of their secretion and enter the blood circulation to reach their distant target organs (29.Goetz R. Beenken A. Ibrahimi O.A. Kalinina J. Olsen S.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Xu C. Neubert T.A. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Yu X. White K.E. Inagaki T. Kliewer S.A. Yamamoto M. Kurosu H. Ogawa Y. Kuro-o M. Lanske B.

Glycosaminoglycan affinity of the complete fibroblast growth factor family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). By contrast, because of their high HS affinity (30.Asada M. Shinomiya M. Suzuki M. Honda E. Sugimoto R. Ikekita M. Imamura T. Glycosaminoglycan affinity of the complete fibroblast growth factor family.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1790: 40-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), paracrine FGFs are mostly immobilized in the vicinity of the cells secreting these ligands and hence can only act within the same organ. There is emerging evidence that differences in HS-binding affinity among paracrine FGFs translate into the formation of ligand-specific gradients in the pericellular matrix (32.Kalinina J. Byron S.A.

From molecular evolution to roles in development, metabolism and disease.J. Biochem. 2011; 149: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling ligand diffusion in the extracellular space, HS promotes the formation of the 2:2 paracrine FGF-FGFR signal transduction unit (see Fig. 1D) (31.Schlessinger J.

HS engages both ligand and receptor to enhance the binding affinity of FGF for receptor and promote dimerization of ligand-bound receptors. Because of their poor HS-binding affinity, endocrine FGFs rely on Klotho co-receptors to bind their cognate FGFR (35.Kurosu H. Choi M. Ogawa Y. Dickson A.S. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M.

Indeed, there are several reports showing that HS can promote endocrine FGF signaling in the presence and even in the absence of Klotho co-receptor. It has been shown that HS augments the mitogenic signal elicited by endocrine FGFs in BaF3 cells overexpressing FGFR and Klotho co-receptor by at least 2-fold (46.Suzuki M. Uehara Y. Motomura-Matsuzaka K. Oki J. Koyama Y. Kimura M. Asada M. Komi-Kuramochi A. Oka S.

Compared with paracrine FGFs, however, significantly higher concentrations of both ligand and HS are needed, and the proliferative response of cells to endocrine FGFs still lags behind that of paracrine FGFs by about an order of magnitude (48.Zhang X. Ibrahimi O.A. Olsen S.K. Umemori H. Mohammadi M. Ornitz D.M. Receptor specificity of the fibroblast growth factor family. The complete mammalian FGF family.J. Biol.

To decipher the role of HS in endocrine FGF signaling, we generated FGF19 and FGF23 mutant ligands devoid of HS binding and compared their signaling capacity with that of wild-type ligands. Our data show that the mutated ligands retain full metabolic activity, demonstrating that HS does not participate in the formation of the endocrine FGF signaling complex. In support of this finding, we convert a paracrine FGF into an endocrine ligand by diminishing HS-binding affinity and replacing the C-terminal tail of the paracrine FGF with that of an endocrine FGF. Importantly, the ligand conversion provides a novel strategy for engineering endocrine FGF-like ligands for therapeutic purposes. The N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged, mature forms of human FGF19 (Arg23–Lys216), human FGF21 (His29–Ser209; see Fig. 5A), and human FGF23 (Tyr25–Ile251; see Fig. 5A) were refolded in vitro from bacterial inclusion bodies and purified by published protocols (49.Ibrahimi O.A.

The second CXCL12-receptor CXCR7 modulates the CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway by acting as a CXCL12 scavenger and exerts G protein-independent functions. Given the distinct properties of CXCR4 and CXCR7, we hypothesized that the distinct C-terminal domains differently regulate receptor trafficking and stability. Here, we examined epitope-tagged wild type and C-terminal mutant receptors in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) with respect to trafficking, stability, 125I-CXCL12 degradation, and G protein-coupling. The 24 CXCR7 C-terminal residues were sufficient to promote rapid spontaneous internalization. Replacement of the CXCR7 C terminus with that of CXCR4 (CXCR7–4tail mutant) abolished spontaneous internalization but permitted ligand-induced internalization and phosphorylation at the heterologous domain. The reverse tail-swap caused ligand-independent internalization of the resulting CXCR4–7tail mutant. Receptor-mediated 125I-CXCL12 uptake and release of 125I-CXCL12 degradation products were accelerated with receptors bearing the CXCR7 C terminus and impaired after conversion of CXCR7 C-terminal serine/threonine residues into alanines. C-terminal lysine residues were dispensable for plasma membrane targeting and the CXCL12 scavenger function but involved in constitutive degradation of CXCR7. Although the CXCR7 C terminus abolished G protein coupling in the CXCR4–7tail mutant, replacement of the CXCR7 C terminus, CXCR7 second intracellular loop, or both domains with the corresponding CXCR4 domain did not result in a G protein-coupled CXCR7 chimera. Taken together, we provide evidence that the CXCR7 C terminus influences the ligand-uptake/degradation rate, G protein coupling, and receptor stability.

https://openalex.org/W2095137393,"The human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP-1) is known to block the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, but the mechanism of inhibition is poorly understood. We examined the effect of HNP-1 on HIV-1 entry and fusion and found that, surprisingly, this α-defensin inhibited multiple steps of virus entry, including: (i) Env binding to CD4 and coreceptors; (ii) refolding of Env into the final 6-helix bundle structure; and (iii) productive HIV-1 uptake but not internalization of endocytic markers. Despite its lectin-like properties, HNP-1 could bind to Env, CD4, and other host proteins in a glycan- and serum-independent manner, whereas the fusion inhibitory activity was greatly attenuated in the presence of human or bovine serum. This demonstrates that binding of α-defensin to molecules involved in HIV-1 fusion is necessary but not sufficient for blocking the virus entry. We therefore propose that oligomeric forms of defensin, which may be disrupted by serum, contribute to the anti-HIV-1 activity perhaps through cross-linking virus and/or host glycoproteins. This notion is supported by the ability of HNP-1 to reduce the mobile fraction of CD4 and coreceptors in the plasma membrane and to precipitate a core subdomain of Env in solution. The ability of HNP-1 to block HIV-1 uptake without interfering with constitutive endocytosis suggests a novel mechanism for broad activity against this and other viruses that enter cells through endocytic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2050057220,"The relevance of preconceptional and prenatal toxicant exposures for genomic stability in offspring is difficult to analyze in human populations, because gestational exposures usually cannot be separated from preconceptional exposures. To analyze the roles of exposures during gestation and conception on genomic stability in the offspring, stability was assessed via the Comet assay and highly sensitive, semiautomated confocal laser scans of γH2AX foci in cord, maternal, and paternal blood as well as spermatozoa from 39 families in Crete, Greece, and the United Kingdom. With use of multivariate linear regression analysis with backward selection, preconceptional paternal smoking (% tail DNA: P> 0.032; γH2AX foci: P>0.018) and gestational maternal (% tail DNA: P> 0.033) smoking were found to statistically significantly predict DNA damage in the cord blood of F1 offspring. Maternal passive smoke exposure was not identified as a predictor of DNA damage in cord blood, indicating that the effect of paternal smoking may be transmitted via the spermatozoal genome. Taken together, these studies reveal a role for cigarette smoke in the induction of DNA alterations in human F1 offspring via exposures of the fetus in utero or the paternal germline. Moreover, the identification of transgenerational DNA alterations in the unexposed F1 offspring of smoking-exposed fathers supports the claim that cigarette smoke is a human germ cell mutagen.—Laubenthal, J., Zlobinskaya, O., Poterlowicz, K., Baumgartner, A., Gdula, M.

The p53 gene expresses 12 different proteins (isoforms), including TAp53 (p53 (or p53α), p53β and p53γ) and Δ133p53 isoforms (Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ133p53γ). The Δ133p53α isoform was shown to modulate p53 transcriptional activity and is overexpressed in various human tumours. However, its role in tumour progression is still unexplored. In the present study, we examined the involvement of Δ133p53 isoforms in tumoural angiogenesis and tumour growth in the highly angiogenic human glioblastoma U87. Our data show that conditioned media from U87 cells depleted for Δ133p53 isoforms block endothelial cell migration and tubulogenesis without affecting endothelial cell proliferation in vitro. The Δ133p53 depletion in U2OS osteosarcoma cells resulted in a similar angiogenesis blockade. Furthermore, using conditioned media from U87 cells ectopically expressing each Δ133p53 isoform, we determined that Δ133p53α and Δ133p53γ but not Δ133p53β, stimulate angiogenesis. Our in vivo data using the chicken chorio-allantoic membrane and mice xenografts establish that angiogenesis and growth of glioblastoma U87 tumours are inhibited upon depletion of Δ133p53 isoforms. By TaqMan low-density array, we show that alteration of expression ratio of Δ133p53 and TAp53 isoforms differentially regulates angiogenic gene expression with Δ133p53 isoforms inducing pro-angiogenic gene expression and repressing anti-angiogenic gene expression."

PMCA4 played only a minor role in the regulation of bulk cytosolic Ca2+, which was more evident at higher Ca2+ loads.

In the present study we compared siRNA-mediated knockdown effects of PMCA1 and PMCA4 in the regulation of global Ca2+ signals and assessed the effects on the viability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, in the absence and presence of the cell death initiators, ionomycin (Ca2+ ionophore) and ABT-263 (Bcl-2 inhibitor). The basal breast cancer molecular subtype is associated with a particularly poor prognosis; therefore, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were selected for these studies because they are a widely used model of the basal-like phenotype. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (American Type Culture Collection) was cultured in high glucose DMEM (Sigma Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS and 4 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C/5% CO2 in a humidified air incubator. All cultures were periodically screened for mycoplasma infection. MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. DharmaFECT 4 (0.1–0.2 μl/well, Dharmacon) was used to transfect cells with Dharmacon ON-TARGETplusTM SMARTpool siRNA, which consists of four pooled siRNA sequences rationally designed to minimize off-target effects (25.Jackson A.L.

Transfection media was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and contained 8% FBS. The siRNAs used in this study included those for PMCA4 (siPMCA4, L-006118-00), PMCA1 (siPMCA1, l-006115-00), and the non-targeting control siRNA (siNT, D-001810-10). All experiments had mRNA knockdown >70% at 24 or 48 h post-siRNA. Cells were plated at 5.0 × 103 cells per well into 96-well plates and siRNA-transfected. Total RNA was isolated (RNeasy Plus mini kit; Qiagen) 24, 48, or 120 h post-transfection and then reverse transcribed using the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Target cDNA were amplified using the TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) and TaqMan Gene Expression assays (PMCA4, Hs00608066_m1; PMCA1, Hs00155949_m1) and standard cycling conditions with a StepOnePlus real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PMCA4 and PMCA1 mRNA levels were quantified by the comparative Ct method as described previously (27.Suchanek K.M. May F.J. Robinson J.A. Lee W.J. Holman N.A. Monteith G.R. Roberts-Thomson S.J.

MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at 7.5 × 103 cells per well into 96-well plates and siRNA-transfected. Transfection media was removed 72 h post-siRNA treatment, and cells were loaded with culture medium containing Fluo-4 AM (4 μm; Molecular Probes) or Fluo-4FF AM (4 μm; Molecular Probes) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in a 5% CO2-humidified air incubator. Loading solution was replaced with physiological salt solution (5.9 mm KCl, 1.4 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 140 mm NaCl, 11.5 mm glucose, 1.8 mm CaCl2), cells were equilibrated to room temperature and then washed twice with a physiological salt solution containing bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0.3%). [Ca2+]CYT was measured in Ca2+ probe loaded cells using a fluorescence imaging plate reader (28.Monteith G.R. Bird G.S.

Membranes were probed with monoclonal anti-PMCA4 antibody (1:1000, JA9, Pierce Antibodies), monoclonal anti-PMCA antibody (1:2000, 5F10, Pierce Antibodies) and monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody (1:10,000, Sigma Aldrich). Anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10000, Bio-Rad) was used to visualize protein bands by chemiluminescence using Super-Signal West Dura (Pierce). All antibodies were diluted in PBST (0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) with skim milk powder (2.5%). Images were acquired and analyzed by densitometry using a VersaDoc instrument and Quantity One Analysis software (Bio-Rad), respectively. All data were normalized to the β-actin loading control and are presented relative to siNT. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at 5.0 × 103 cells per well into 96-well plates and siRNA-transfected. At 72 h post-transfection, medium was removed, and cells were treated with ABT-263 (Selleckchem), ionomycin (Enzo Life Sciences), Z-VAD-FMK (Enzo Life Sciences), IMD-0354 (Sigma-Aldrich), or dimethyl sulfoxide (up to 1%) for 48 h in phenol red-free DMEM containing FBS (8%). Live cells were stained at 37 °C for 15 min with Hoechst 33342 (10 μg/ml, Invitrogen) and propidium iodide (1 μg/ml, Invitrogen). Images were acquired using an ImageXpress micro automated epifluorescence microscope (Molecular Devices Corp.) with a 10× objective, a system previously used for cell death assays (30.Chu K.Y. Lin Y.

Four images were automatically acquired per well in the DAPI and Cy3 channel for Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide, respectively. The multiwavelength cell scoring application module (MetaXpress, version 3.1.0.83; Molecular Devices Corp.) was used to segment cell nuclei to calculate the average Hoechst 33342 integrated intensity and the average propidium iodide intensity emitted per cell. Criteria for viable, apoptotic and necrotic (and secondary apoptosis) are shown graphically in figures and validated using the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. MDA-MB-231 cells were plated at 3.5 × 103 cells per well into 96-well plates and transfected with siRNA. Post-siRNA transfection (48 h), medium was removed, and cells were serum-reduced (2% FBS) for 12 h, prior to the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 nm, Sigma) or dimethyl sulfoxide (0.05%) for 1 h in DMEM (10% FBS) (33.Signorelli P.

Cells were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde in PBS), blocked (PBS, 5% normal goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100), and then stained with the polyclonal anti-NFκB p65 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) diluted 1:100 in PBS containing BSA (1%) and Triton X-100 (0.3%). NFκB was visualized using anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab′)2 fragment Alexa Fluor® 555 conjugate secondary antibody (1:500, Cell Signaling Technologies).

E-TABM-244 (cell lines) and NCBI GEO accession no. GSE2034 (tumors)). Affymetrix probes for PMCA1 (215716_s_at) and PMCA4 (212136_at) were shared between these data sets. Samples were stratified based on their reported annotations (basal versus luminal for cell lines, and ER− versus ER+ for tumors). Normalized gene expression levels (log2) were plotted, and median levels of each gene were compared between groups (Mann-Whitney test). For relapse-free survival analysis, tumors were stratified into groups corresponding to the upper and lower quartiles and the interquartile range for Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were performed as described in the figure legends using GraphPad Prism (version 5.04) for Windows. There was a significant (p < 0.05) reduction in PMCA4 (Fig. 1A) and PMCA1 (Fig. 1B) mRNA levels in cells transfected with PMCA4 siRNA or PMCA1 siRNA, respectively, compared with the siNT control. PMCA4 protein expression was also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced by PMCA4 siRNA (Fig. 1, C and D) but was not associated with significant changes in total PMCA protein expression (Fig. 1, C and E). Consistent with high levels of PMCA1, total PMCA protein levels were reduced by PMCA1 siRNA (Fig. 1, C and E; p < 0.05). This was not associated with changes in PMCA4 expression (Fig. 1, C and D). In the absence of extracellular Ca2+, increases in [Ca2+]CYT elicited by the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA, 10 μm) were markedly altered with siRNA-mediated knockdown of PMCA1 but not by PMCA4 knockdown (Fig. 2, A–D). PMCA1 silencing significantly (p < 0.05) delayed the time to reach the maximal Ca2+ response (Fig. 2B), increased the half-peak decay time (Fig. 2C) and increased the area under the curve (Fig. 2D) compared with siNT. The effect was isoform-specific, as PMCA4 knockdown did not alter the nature of the CPA-induced Ca2+ response when compared with siNT (Fig. 2, A–D). The purinergic receptor agonist ATP (100 μm) induced a rapid rise in [Ca2+]CYT (Fig. 2E), with no significant difference in the peak maximum between siRNA treatments (mean ± S.D.; siPMCA1, 2.56 ± 0.23; siPMCA4, 2.68 ± 0.31; siNT, 2.99 ± 0.39). However, PMCA1 knockdown significantly altered the recovery of [Ca2+]CYT after ATP stimulation (Fig. 2F-H) in comparison with siNT, resulting in a slower rate of [Ca2+]CYT decay in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2F), a delay in half-peak decay time (Fig. 2G) and an increase in the area under the curve (Fig. 2H). These effects were isoform-specific as similar changes were not seen with PMCA4 silencing (Fig. 2, E–H). To assess the consequences of isoform-specific PMCA knockdown with [Ca2+]CYT increases of a greater magnitude, we compared the effects of PMCA4 or PMCA1 siRNA on [Ca2+]CYT changes mediated by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (1.8 mm). Increases in [Ca2+]CYT mediated by ionomycin (3 μm) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased with PMCA1 or PMCA4 knockdown compared with siNT (Fig. 3, A and B). These effects were more pronounced (p < 0.05) with PMCA1 knockdown compared with PMCA4 knockdown (Fig. 3, A and B). Silencing of PMCA1 or PMCA4 also augmented increases in [Ca2+]CYT mediatedby 10 μm ionomycin; however, in contrast to 3 μm ionomycin, there were no differences in effect between the two isoforms (Fig. 3, C and D). No effect on cell viability was detected with knockdown of PMCA4 (Fig. 4, A, B, and D) or PMCA1 (Fig. 4, A, C, and D) compared with siNT. PMCA1 and PMCA4 were effectively silenced at the time of the assessment of cell viability (Fig. 4, E and F). Reduced Ca2+ efflux mediated by either PMCA1 or PMCA4 silencing was therefore insufficient for the activation of cell death pathways in MDA-MB-231 cells. To assess whether reduced PMCA1 or PMCA4 expression could alter the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to different cell deat"
https://openalex.org/W2155361518,"Cytochrome c oxidase (COX) is the terminal enzyme of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The purpose of this study was to analyze the function of lung-specific cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4 isoform 2 (COX4i2) in vitro and in COX4i2-knockout mice in vivo. COX was isolated from cow lung and liver as control and functionally analyzed. COX4i2-knockout mice were generated and the effect of the gene knockout was determined, including COX activity, tissue energy levels, noninvasive and invasive lung function, and lung pathology. These studies were complemented by a comprehensive functional screen performed at the German Mouse Clinic (Neuherberg, Germany). We show that isolated cow lung COX containing COX4i2 is about twice as active (88 and 102% increased activity in the presence of allosteric activator ADP and inhibitor ATP, respectively) as liver COX, which lacks COX4i2. In COX4i2-knockout mice, lung COX activity and cellular ATP levels were significantly reduced (-50 and -29%, respectively). Knockout mice showed decreased airway responsiveness (60% reduced P(enh) and 58% reduced airway resistance upon challenge with 25 and 100 mg methacholine, respectively), and they developed a lung pathology deteriorating with age that included the appearance of Charcot-Leyden crystals. In addition, there was an interesting sex-specific phenotype, in which the knockout females showed reduced lean mass (-12%), reduced total oxygen consumption rate (-8%), improved glucose tolerance, and reduced grip force (-14%) compared to wild-type females. Our data suggest that high activity lung COX is a central determinant of airway function and is required for maximal airway responsiveness and healthy lung function. Since airway constriction requires energy, we propose a model in which reduced tissue ATP levels explain protection from airway hyperresponsiveness, i.e., absence of COX4i2 leads to reduced lung COX activity and ATP levels, which results in impaired airway constriction and thus reduced airway responsiveness; long-term lung pathology develops in the knockout mice due to impairment of energy-costly lung maintenance processes; and therefore, we propose mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation as a novel target for the treatment of respiratory diseases, such as asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2063859846,"LAPTM5 (lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane 5) is a protein that is preferentially expressed in immune cells, and it interacts with the Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases. Recent studies in T and B cells identified LAPTM5 as a negative regulator of T and B cell receptor levels at the plasma membrane. Here we investigated the function of LAPTM5 in macrophages. We demonstrate that expression of LAPTM5 is required for the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines in response to Toll-like receptor ligands. We also show that RAW264.7 cells knocked down for LAPTM5 or macrophages from LAPTM5(-/-) mice exhibit reduced activation of NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways mediated by the TNF receptor, as well as multiple pattern recognition receptors in various cellular compartments. TNF stimulation of LAPTM5-deficient macrophages leads to reduced ubiquitination of RIP1 (receptor-interacting protein 1), suggesting a role for LAPTM5 at the receptor-proximate level. Interestingly, we find that macrophages from LAPTM5(-/-) mice display up-regulated levels of A20, a ubiquitin-editing enzyme responsible for deubiquitination of RIP1 and subsequent termination of NF-κB activation. Our studies thus indicate that, in contrast to its negative role in T and B cell activation, LAPTM5 acts as a positive modulator of inflammatory signaling pathways and hence cytokine secretion in macrophages. They also highlight a role for the endosomal/lysosomal system in regulating signaling via cytokine and pattern recognition receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1976678739,"Ubiquitin signals emanating from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) trigger the ordered assembly of DNA damage mediator and repair proteins. This highly orchestrated process is accomplished, in part, through the concerted action of the RNF8 and RNF168 E3 ligases, which have emerged as core signaling intermediates that promote DSB-associated ubiquitylation events. In this study, we report the identification of RNF169 as a negative regulator of the DNA damage signaling cascade. We found that RNF169 interacted with ubiquitin structures and relocalized to DSBs in an RNF8/RNF168-dependent manner. Moreover, ectopic expression of RNF169 attenuated ubiquitin signaling and compromised 53BP1 accumulation at DNA damage sites, suggesting that RNF169 antagonizes RNF168 functions at DSBs. Our study unveils RNF169 as a component in DNA damage signal transduction and adds to the complexity of regulatory ubiquitylation in genome stability maintenance."

Here we show that peroxisomes contain a member of the Lon family of proteases (Pln). We show that Pln is a heptameric protein and acts as an ATP-fueled protease and chaperone. Hence, Pln is the first chaperone identified in fungal peroxisomes. In cells of a PLN deletion strain peroxisomes contain protein aggregates, a major component of which is catalase-peroxidase. We show that this enzyme is sensitive to oxidative damage. The oxidatively damaged, but not the native protein, is a substrate of the Pln protease. Cells of the pln strain contain enhanced levels of catalase-peroxidase protein but reduced catalase-peroxidase enzyme activities. Together with the observation that Pln has chaperone activity in vitro, our data suggest that catalase-peroxidase aggregates accumulate in peroxisomes of pln cells due to the combined absence of Pln protease and chaperone activities.

Functional proteins generally adapt a defined three-dimensional structure, designated their native fold. Nevertheless, they need to retain conformational flexibility to allow functioning, and as a consequence, they are only marginally thermodynamically stable macromolecules. Hence, preexisting folded proteins are at constant risk of being unfolded, especially at environmental stress conditions (1Dobson C.M. Protein folding and misfolding.Nature. 2003; 426: 884-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3758) Google Scholar, 2Jaenicke R.

The Yin and Yang of protein folding.FEBS J. 2005; 272: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Aberrantly folded polypeptides as well as folding intermediates expose hydrophobic residues that are normally buried in the native fold and are prone to trigger protein aggregation (4Ellis R.J. Minton A.P. Protein aggregation in crowded environments.Biol. Chem. 2006; 387: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Aggregation of misfolded protein species is linked with the perturbation of cellular functions, aging, and various human disorders (5Hartl F.U. Bracher A. Hayer-Hartl M. Molecular chaperones in protein folding and proteostasis.Nature. 2011; 475: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2190) Google Scholar). To circumvent this, cells evolved sophisticated protein quality control systems, among which are molecular chaperones that facilitate folding and refolding of polypeptides and proteolytic machines that remove misfolded conformers from the cellular interior (6Tyedmers J. Mogk A. Bukau B. Cellular strategies for controlling protein aggregation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 777-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). These systems are indispensable for protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in cells (7Powers E.T. Morimoto R.I. Dillin A. Kelly J.W. Balch W.E. Biological and chemical approaches to diseases of proteostasis deficiency.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2009; 78: 959-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Yet little is known of protein quality control in peroxisomes. Despite their simple architecture, peroxisomes are important organelles that display an unprecedented diversity of functions depending on metabolic needs and external stimuli (8Islinger M. Grille S. Fahimi H.D. Schrader M. The peroxisome. An update on mysteries.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2012; 137: 547-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). They are crucial in man, manifested by the presence various inherited disorders (i.e. neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, Zellweger syndrome, infantile Refsum's disease, rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata) caused by impairment of one or more peroxisomal functions (9Wanders R.J.

Braverman N.E. Moser A.B. Peroxisome Biogenesis Disorders, Zellweger Syndrome Spectrum. University of Washington, Seattle, WA1993Google Scholar). The hallmark of peroxisomes is the metabolism of hydrogen peroxide that is generated as a byproduct of the organelle oxidative metabolism (11Antonenkov V.D. Grunau S. Ohlmeier S. Hiltunen J.K. Peroxisomes are oxidative organelles.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide can be the source of the most highly reactive and toxic form of reactive oxygen species, the hydroxyl radical (•OH), which is generated in the Fenton reaction (12Reeder B.J. Svistunenko D.A. Cooper C.E. Wilson M.T. The radical and redox chemistry of myoglobin and hemoglobin. From in vitro studies to human pathology.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 954-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To cope with reactive oxygen species formation, peroxisomes contain a set of peroxide decomposing enzymes among which are catalase, peroxiredoxins, or peroxidases (11Antonenkov V.D. Grunau S. Ohlmeier S. Hiltunen J.K. Peroxisomes are oxidative organelles.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2010; 13: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Peroxisomes may import folded proteins and even oligomeric protein complexes (13Walton P.A. Hill P.E. Subramani S. Import of stably folded proteins into peroxisomes.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) rendering these organelles attractive models to analyze the mechanisms involved in housekeeping of preexisting, folded proteins. Recently, a conserved ATP-dependent Lon protease has been identified in peroxisomes (14Aksam E.B. Koek A. Kiel J.A. Jourdan S. Veenhuis M. van der Klei I.J.

The mitochondrial isoform of this protease was shown to represent the main quality control protease of the organelle matrix (16Wagner I. Arlt H. van Dyck L. Langer T. Neupert W.

Chem. 2005; 386: 1307-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial Lon selectively degrades misfolded, unassembled, and damaged proteins (18Bota D.A. Davies K.J.

Singh K. Lee I. Suzuki C.K. Multitasking in the mitochondrion by the ATP-dependent Lon protease.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2012; 1823: 56-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the molecular function of the peroxisomal Lon protease is not yet clear. In this work we demonstrate that peroxisomal Lon is a multifunctional protein that acts as a protease, selectively degrading aberrant peroxisomal matrix proteins, but also assists in refolding of these components. As such, Lon is the first peroxisomal chaperone identified in fungi so far. Penicillium chrysogenum strains used in this study are listed in Table 1.

Here we describe a novel immunoassay based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that specifically recognizes biologically active Aβ oligomers. As a capturing agent, we immobilized on the sensor chip the monoclonal antibody 4G8, which targets a central hydrophobic region of Aβ. This SPR assay allows specific recognition of oligomeric intermediates that rapidly appear and disappear during the incubation of synthetic Aβ1–42, discriminating them from monomers and higher order aggregates. The species recognized by SPR generate ionic currents in artificial lipid bilayers and inhibit the physiological pharyngeal contractions in Caenorhabditis elegans, a new method for testing the toxic potential of Aβ oligomers. With these assays we found that the formation of biologically relevant Aβ oligomers is inhibited by epigallocatechin gallate and increased by the A2V mutation, previously reported to induce early onset dementia. The SPR-based immunoassay provides new opportunities for detection of toxic Aβ oligomers in biological samples and could be adapted to study misfolding proteins in other neurodegenerative disorders.

https://openalex.org/W2064955782,"Glioblastomas show heterogeneous histological features, and tumor cells show distinct phenotypic states that confer different functional attributes and an aggressive character. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity in this disease are poorly understood. Glioma stem-like cells (GSCs) are considered able to aberrantly differentiate into diverse cell types and may contribute to the establishment of tumor heterogeneity. Using a GSC model, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) and associated epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the differentiation of GSCs. miRNA profiling using microarray technology showed that 13 and 34 miRNAs were commonly up-regulated and down-regulated in two independent GSC lines during differentiation, respectively. Among this set of miRNAs, quantitative PCR analysis showed that miRNA-1275 (miR-1275) was consistently down-regulated during GSC differentiation, along with the up-regulation of its target, CLDN11, an important protein during oligodendroglial lineage differentiation. Inhibition of miR-1275 with a specific antisense oligonucleotide (anti-miR-1275) in GSCs increased the expression of CLDN11, together with significant growth suppression. Epigenetic analysis revealed that gain of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in the primary microRNA-1275 promoter was closely associated with miR-1275 expression. Treatment with 3-deazaneplanocin A, an inhibitor of H3K27 methyltransferase, attenuated CLDN11 induction by serum stimulation in parallel with sustained miR-1275 expression. Our results have illuminated the epigenetic regulatory pathways of miR-1275 that are closely associated with oligodendroglial differentiation, which may contribute to the tissue heterogeneity seen in the formation of glioblastomas. Given that inhibition of miR-1275 induces expression of oligodendroglial lineage proteins and suppresses tumor cell proliferation, this may be a potential therapeutic target for glioblastomas."

Breakdown of this balance will lead to autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). The antiepileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) was reported to regulate the growth, survival, and differentiation of many cells. However, its function in T cell homeostasis and MS treatment remains unknown. In this study, VPA was found to reduce spinal cord inflammation, demyelination, and disease scores in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a mouse model of MS. Further study indicated that VPA induces apoptosis in activated T cells and maintains the immune homeostasis. This effect was found to be mainly mediated by the caspase-8/caspase-3 pathway. Interestingly, this phenomenon was also confirmed in T cells from normal human subjects and MS patients. Considering the long history of clinical use and our new findings, we believe VPA might be a safe and effective therapy for autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis.

A pre-requisite for both core α1,6-fucosylation and β1,4-galactosylation is the presence of a nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine; however, this residue is normally absent from the final glycan structure in invertebrates due to the action of specific hexosaminidases. Previously, we have identified two hexosaminidases (HEX-2 and HEX-3) in C. elegans, which process N-glycans. In the present study, we have prepared a hex-2;hex-3 double mutant, which possesses a radically altered N-glycomic profile. Whereas in the double mutant core α1,3-fucosylation of the proximal N-acetylglucosamine was abolished, the degree of galactosylation of core α1,6-fucose increased, and a novel Galα1,2Fucα1,3 moiety attached to the distal core N-acetylglucosamine residue was detected. Both galactosylated fucose moieties were also found in two parasitic nematodes, Ascaris suum and Oesophagostomum dentatum. As core modifications of N-glycans are known targets for fungal nematotoxic lectins, the sensitivity of the C. elegans double hexosaminidase mutant was assessed. Although this mutant displayed hypersensitivity to the GalFuc-binding lectin CGL2 and the N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectin XCL, the mutant was resistant to CCL2, which binds core α1,3-fucose. Thus, the use of C. elegans mutants aids the identification of novel N-glycan modifications and the definition of in vivo specificities of nematotoxic lectins with potential as anthelmintic agents.

https://openalex.org/W2089103239,"Considerable interest has been generated from the results of recent clinical trials using smoothened (SMO) antagonists to inhibit the growth of hedgehog (HH) signaling-dependent tumors. This interest is tempered by the discovery of SMO mutations mediating resistance, underscoring the rationale for developing therapeutic strategies that interrupt HH signaling at levels distinct from those inhibiting SMO function. Here, we demonstrate that HH-dependent non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) growth is sensitive to blockade of the HH pathway upstream of SMO, at the level of HH ligand processing. Individually, the use of different lentivirally delivered shRNA constructs targeting two functionally distinct HH-processing proteins, skinny hedgehog (SKN) or dispatched-1 (DISP-1), in NSCLC cell lines produced similar decreases in cell proliferation and increased cell death. Further, providing either an exogenous source of processed HH or a SMO agonist reverses these effects. The attenuation of HH processing, by knocking down either of these gene products, also abrogated tumor growth in mouse xenografts. Finally, we extended these findings to primary clinical specimens, showing that SKN is frequently overexpressed in NSCLC and that higher DISP-1 expression is associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome. Our results show a critical role for HH processing in HH-dependent tumors, identifies two potential druggable targets in the HH pathway, and suggest that similar therapeutic strategies could be explored to treat patients harboring HH ligand-dependent cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2038894919,"The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 is a key regulator of cell-cycle progression. Its expression and localization are altered in several types of malignancies, which has prognostic significance in cancers such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC). S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP-2) is an F-box protein that is part of the SKP-1/Cul1/F-box ubiquitin ligase complex that targets nuclear p27 among many other cell-cycle proteins for proteosomal degradation. Its overexpression has been observed in several tumor types. Signaling by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) has previously been shown to regulate the SKP-2/p27 axis. Recent evidence suggests that PI3K signaling may activate mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) activity. As PI3K signaling is known to regulate SKP-2 and p27, we sought to determine whether these effects were mediated by mTORC2. Here we provide additional genetic evidence that PI3K signaling activates mTORC2 kinase activity. We also demonstrate a novel role for mTORC2 in the modulation of nuclear p27 levels. In particular, mTORC2 signaling promotes the reduction of nuclear p27 protein levels through the increased protein expression of SKP-2. These are the first data to demonstrate a role for mTOR in the regulation of SKP-2. In concordance with these findings, mTORC2 activity promotes cell proliferation of RCC cells at the G1–S interphase of the cell cycle. Collectively, these data implicate mTORC2 signaling in the regulation of the SKP-2/p27 axis, a signaling node commonly altered in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2113449585,"Brain liver intestine Na+ channel (BLINaC) is an ion channel of the DEG/ENaC gene family of unknown function. BLINaC from rats (rBLINaC) and humans (INaC) is inactive at rest, and its mode of activation has remained unclear. Here, we show that the BLINaC protein localizes to cholangiocytes, epithelial cells that line bile ducts. Moreover, we provide evidence that rBLINaC and INaC are robustly activated by bile acids, in particular chenodeoxycholic acid and hyodeoxycholic acid (EC50=2.1±0.05 mM). Thus, BLINaC appears to be an epithelial cation channel of bile ducts sensitive to physiological concentrations of bile acids. BLINaC is related to acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) and to the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) and shares ligand activation with ASICs and epithelial localization with ENaC. Therefore, based on the close homology of BLINaC to ASICs and its activation by bile acids, we propose to rename BLINaC bile acid-sensitive ion channel (BASIC).—Wiemuth, D., Sahin, H., Falkenburger, B.

https://openalex.org/W1986361830,"In mammalian cells, the nucleosome-binding protein HMGN1 (high mobility group N1) affects the structure and function of chromatin and plays a role in repair of damaged DNA. HMGN1 affects the interaction of DNA repair factors with chromatin and their access to damaged DNA; however, not all of the repair factors affected have been identified. Here, we report that HMGN1 affects the self-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (i.e., PARylation) of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a multifunctional and abundant nuclear enzyme known to recognize DNA lesions and promote chromatin remodeling, DNA repair, and other nucleic acid transactions. The catalytic activity of PARP-1 is activated by DNA with a strand break, and this results in self-PARylation and PARylation of other chromatin proteins. Using cells obtained from Hmgn1−/− and Hmgn1+/+ littermate mice, we find that in untreated cells, loss of HMGN1 protein reduces PARP-1 self-PARylation. A similar result was obtained after MMS treatment of these cells. In imaging experiments after low energy laser-induced DNA damage, less PARylation at lesion sites was observed in Hmgn1−/− than in Hmgn1+/+ cells. The HMGN1 regulation of PARP-1 activity could be mediated by direct protein-protein interaction as HMGN1 and PARP-1 were found to interact in binding assays. Purified HMGN1 was able to stimulate self-PARylation of purified PARP-1, and in experiments with cell extracts, self-PARylation was greater in Hmgn1+/+ than in Hmgn1−/− extract.

https://openalex.org/W1972586311,"Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common type of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), frequently overexpresses epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the mechanisms underlying EGFR overexpression are not completely understood. Recent studies have identified that decreased expression of TIP30 (30kDa HIV-1 Tat interacting protein) is associated with the metastasis of human NSCLCs, but a causative relationship between TIP30 deficiency and NSCLC development remains unclear. We show here that Tip30 deletion leads to spontaneous development of lung adenomas and adenocarcinomas in mice. Lung tumor development was preceded by aberrant expansion of bronchioalveolar stem/progenitor and alveolar type II (AT2) cells, and also increased expression of EGFR and its downstream signaling factors in the lung of Tip30(-/-) mice. Moreover, TIP30 knockdown in human lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in prolonged EGFR activity in early endosomes, delayed EGFR degradation, increased EGFR nuclear localization, leading to upregulated pAKT and pERK1/2 expression. Importantly, in human lung adenocarcinomas, low TIP30 expression correlates with prolonged patient overall and post-progression survival times. Together, these results suggest that TIP30 functions as a tumor suppressor to inhibit EGFR cytoplasmic and nuclear signaling and suppress adenocarcinogenesis in the lung, and highlight the potential of therapeutic strategies aiming at inhibiting EGFR signaling for patients with low TIP30-expression lung adenocarcinoma."

Mesophilic Aeromonas are ubiquitous water-borne bacteria, considered opportunistic pathogens of both aquatic and terrestrial animals, with some species being associated with gastrointestinal and extraintestinal human diseases (1Janda J.M. Abbott S.L. The genus Aeromonas: Taxonomy, pathogenicity, and infection.Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2010; 23: 35-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Flagellar motility represents an important advantage for bacteria in moving toward favorable conditions or in avoiding detrimental environments, and it allows flagellated bacteria to successfully compete with other microorganisms (2Fenchel T. Microbial behavior in a heterogeneous world.Science. 2002; 296: 1068-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Flagellar morphogenesis is a complex cascade of events that requires coordinated expression of >50 genes encoding structural subunits, regulatory proteins, and chemo-sensor machinery. Mesophilic Aeromonas are aquatic microorganisms that constitutively express a single polar flagellum, although ∼60% of strains most commonly associated with diarrhea (3Kirov S.M. Tassell B.C. Semmler A.B. O'Donovan L.A. Rabaan A.A. Shaw J.G. Lateral flagella and swarming motility in Aeromonas species.J.

Investigations have revealed that both the polar and lateral flagellar systems of the mesophilic Aeromonas are involved in adherence to both biotic and abiotic surfaces, as well as in the biofilm formation (5Kirov S.M. Castrisios M. Shaw J.G. Aeromonas flagella (polar and lateral) are enterocyte adhesins that contribute to biofilm formation on surfaces.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Glycosylation, either N- or O-linked, has been described extensively in eukaryotes but more recently has also been described in bacteria (reviewed in Refs. 6Logan S.M.

The most commonly reported form of protein glycosylation in bacteria is O-linkage of the sugar moiety to the hydroxyl oxygen of serine (Ser) or threonine (Thr) residues of proteins. This appears to be most commonly found in bacterial flagellins and pili (6Logan S.M. Flagellar glycosylation: A new component of the motility repertoire?.Microbiology. 2006; 152: 1249-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with increasing numbers of bacterial pathogens reported to modify flagellins or pili with diverse carbohydrate moieties.

Structural studies of the glycan moieties modifying proteins have been carried out in some cases, showing that the glycan structures elaborated vary markedly between species. Such studies have shed light on glycan structural diversity and in some cases aided in understanding the associated biosynthetic pathways. There is some limited understanding of the biological significance of bacterial glycoproteins, but some recent insights as functions affecting surface properties linked to antigenicity have been described (15Chamot-Rooke J.

Posttranslational modification of pili upon cell contact triggers Neisseria meningitidis dissemination.Science. 2011; 331: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The predominant O-glycans attached to the Campylobacter or Helicobacter flagellum are derivatives of nonulosonic acids sugars such as pseudaminic acid (Pse) or legionaminic acid (Leg). These are C9 sugars that are related to sialic acids (16Schoenhofen I.C. Vinogradov E. Whitfield D.M. Brisson J.R. Logan S.M.

Aeromonas hydrophila AH-3, similar to ∼60% of the clinical isolates of mesophilic Aeromonas produces a single polar flagellum constitutively expressed in both liquid and solid media and also have inducible lateral flagella expressed in high viscosity media (17Canals R.

Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 2851-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Also, in Aeromonas caviae Sch3N, the mutation in biosynthetic Pse genes affected either the flagellar biogenesis as well as the O-antigen LPS (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In this strain, we were able to demonstrate that Pse residues are the component of their specific O-antigen LPS (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In this study, for the first time in A. hydrophila strain AH-3, we show that polar and lateral flagellins are modified by different carbohydrate moieties but share one of the sugars (pesudaminic acid derivative). We also studied how the glycosylation type affects the flagellar biogenesis and also the flagellin production at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Escherichia coli strains were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) Miller broth and on LB Miller agar at 37 °C, whereas Aeromonas strains were grown either in tryptic soy broth or on agar at 30 °C. When indicated kanamycin (50 μg/ml), rifampicin (100 μg/ml), spectinomycin (50 μg/ml), tetracycline (20 μg/ml), and chloramphenicol (25 μg/ml) were added to the media.TABLE 1Bacterial strains and plasmids usedStrain or plasmidRelevant characteristicsRef. or SourceE. coli strains DH5αF− end A hsdR17 (rK− mK+) supE44 thi-1 recA1 gyr-A96 _80lacZM1528Towbin H.

Flagellar glycosylation in Clostridium botulinum.FEBS J. 2008; 275: 4428-4444Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The lateral flagellin sample was injected onto a protein microtrap (Michrom Bioresources Inc., Auburn, CA) connected to a gradient HPLC pump (Agilent 1100 HPLC). Solvent A was 0.1% formic acid in HPLC grade water (Fisher), and solvent B was 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. An HPLC gradient of 5–60% solvent B (1 ml/min) over 60 min was used to resolve the protein mixture. The more complex polar flagellin sample was injected onto an Agilent mRP Hi recovery column (5 μm; 0.5 mm, inner diameter × 100 mm) also connected to a gradient HPLC pump (Agilent 1100 HPLC). A step gradient was applied to separate the protein mixture as follows: 20% B for 10 min, 35% B for 10 min, 45% B for 10 min, 55% B for 10 min. In both cases, a precolumn splitter was used to direct ∼35 μl/min of the HPLC mobile phase through the trap or column and into the electrospray interface of the QTOF2 (Waters, Milford, MA) to allow real-time monitoring of ion elution profiles. Intact masses of proteins were calculated by spectral deconvolution using MaxEnt (Waters, Beverly, MA) or similar software. For the lateral flagellin, an abundant multiply charged protein ion was selected for MS/MS. The collision energy was increased incrementally, and labile, protein, and glycan-associated fragment ions were observed. For the polar flagellin, front-end collision-induced dissociation (feCID) 3The abbreviations used are: feCIDfront-end collision induced dissociationnLCnano-liquid chromatographyETDelectron transfer dissociation. was performed by increasing the cone voltage from 45 to 85 V, and glycan-associated oxonium ions were observed.

To identify the type and location of glycosylation sites, flagellin (50 to 200 μg) was digested with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) at a ratio of 30:1 (protein/enzyme, w/w) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate at 37 °C overnight as described previously (13Twine S.M.

MS/MS spectra were acquired automatically on doubly, triply, and quadruply charged ions in collision-induced dissociation (CID) mode for initial glycopeptide identification. The lateral flagellin modification site was determined using targeted CID of the m/z 870.42+ glycopeptide ion with alternating high and low collision energies (24 and 20 V). The polar flagellin modification site was determined using targeted electron transfer dissociation (ETD) of the m/z 1060.73+ glycopeptide ion with a 300-s reaction time using an LTQ-XL ion trap MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data were collected between 300 and 3200 m/z (high mass range). Multistage mass spectrometry studies of glycan moieties were performed in high resolution (100,000) mode on the LTQ XL orbitrap MS.

Briefly, upstream (fragment AB) and downstream (fragment CD) of pseB and pseF genes were independently amplified using two sets of asymmetric PCRs for each gene.

The DNA fragment PseF-AB contains 648 bp upstream pseF and the first 20 codons of pseF. DNA fragment PseF-CD contains from the first base in the 205 codon of pseF to 460 bp downstream pseF. DNA fragments AB and CD of each gene were annealed at the overlapping regions (underlined letters in primers B and C) and amplified as a single fragment using primers A and D.

A. hydrophila cells grown in tryptic soy broth at 25 °C were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g), washed with 20 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm Tris buffer (pH = 8.0), and resuspended in the same cold buffer, and French press cell lysis was performed. The lysates were centrifuged at 5000 × g to remove unbroken cells. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 1 h at 115,000 × g, the cytoplasmic fraction remained in the supernatant, whereas the whole membrane fraction was retained in the pellet. A. hydrophila AH-3 was grown in tryptic soy broth for the polar flagellum purification. For the isolation of lateral flagella, the strains were grown on tryptic soy agar plates washed with 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8). Cells were in both cases collected by centrifugation at 5000 × g and suspended in the same Tris buffer. Flagella were removed from the cells by shearing in a vortex with a glass bar for 3–4 min and then passing repetitively (minimum six times) through a syringe. Cells were removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min. From the remaining supernatant, the flagella were pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min and resuspended in 100 mm Tris (pH 7.8) plus 2 mm EDTA buffer. This flagella-enriched fraction was purified in a cesium chloride gradient by ultracentifugation at 60,000 × g for 48 h. The band containing the flagella was collected, and cesium chloride was removed by extensive dialysis against the same buffer (100 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA). Purified flagella were analyzed by SDS-PAGE or by glycosylation chemical studies. Western blot of whole cell, cell fractions, or purified flagella was performed as briefly described.

Incubations were carried out for 1 h, and washing steps with 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline were included after each incubation step. ELISA was performed by dispensing standardized suspensions of each cell fraction in coating buffer (pH 9.6) into 96-well microtiter plates. The plates were left to stand overnight at 4 °C. The wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 h at 37 °C. Anti-polar flagellins polyclonal serum (1:5000) was added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and detection was performed by using peroxidase-labeled sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:1000) and 2,2′-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate) as the substrate.

https://openalex.org/W2043390820,"The reactivation of the INK4-ARF locus, which is epigenetically repressed by Polycomb proteins in healthy cells, is a hallmark of senescence. One mechanism of reactivating Polycomb-silenced genes is mediated by the epigenetic factor ZRF1, which associates with ubiquitinated histone H2A. We show that cells undergoing senescence following oncogenic Ras expression have increased ZRF1 levels, and that this binds to the p15INK4b, ARF and p16INK4a promoters. Furthermore, ZRF1 depletion in oncogenic Ras-expressing cells restores proliferation by preventing Arf and p16Ink4a expression, consequently bypassing senescence. Thus, ZRF1 regulates the INK4-ARF locus during cellular proliferation and senescence, and alterations in ZRF1 may contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1966836579,"Ras-driven tumorigenesis is assumed to depend on Raf for ERK activation and proliferation; yet, an in vivo requirement for Raf as MEK/ERK activator in this setting has not been demonstrated to date. Here, we show that epidermis-restricted B-Raf ablation restrains the onset and stops the progression of established Ras-driven tumors by limiting MEK/ERK activation and proliferation. Concomitant elimination of B-Raf and Raf-1 enforces the abrupt regression of established tumors owing to the decrease in ERK activation and proliferation caused by B-Raf ablation combined with the ERK-independent increase in Rho-dependent kinase (Rok) signaling and differentiation triggered by Raf-1 inactivation. Thus, B-Raf and Raf-1 have non-redundant functions in Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Of note, Raf kinase inhibitors achieve impressive results in melanomas harboring oncogenic BRAF, but are ineffective against Ras-driven tumors; moreover, therapy-related skin tumors driven by a paradox ERK activation as well as primary and acquired resistance have been reported. Our results suggest that therapies targeting both Raf kinase-dependent and -independent pathways may be effective against a broader range of malignancies and reduce the risks of adverse effects and/or resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2063639409,"Ada3 protein is an essential component of histone acetyl transferase containing coactivator complexes conserved from yeast to human. We show here that germline deletion of Ada3 in mouse is embryonic lethal, and adenovirus-Cre mediated conditional deletion of Ada3 in Ada3(FL/FL) mouse embryonic fibroblasts leads to a severe proliferation defect which was rescued by ectopic expression of human Ada3. A delay in G(1) to S phase of cell cycle was also seen that was due to accumulation of Cdk inhibitor p27 which was an indirect effect of c-myc gene transcription control by Ada3. We further showed that this defect could be partially reverted by knocking down p27. Additionally, drastic changes in global histone acetylation and changes in global gene expression were observed in microarray analyses upon loss of Ada3. Lastly, formation of abnormal nuclei, mitotic defects and delay in G(2)/M to G(1) transition was seen in Ada3 deleted cells. Taken together, we provide evidence for a critical role of Ada3 in embryogenesis and cell cycle progression as an essential component of HAT complex."
https://openalex.org/W1972877030,"Ricin is a highly toxic protein produced by the castor plant Ricinus communis. The toxin is relatively easy to isolate and can be used as a biological weapon. There is great interest in identifying effective inhibitors for ricin. In this study, we demonstrated by three independent assays that a component of reconstituted powdered milk has a high binding affinity to ricin. We discovered that milk can competitively bind to and reduce the amount of toxin available to asialofetuin type II, which is used as a model to study the binding of ricin to galactose cell-surface receptors. Milk also removes ricin bound to the microtiter plate. In parallel experiments, we demonstrated by activity assay and by immuno-PCR that milk can bind competitively to 1 ng/ml ricin, reducing the amount of toxin uptake by the cells, and thus inhibit the biological activity of ricin. The inhibitory effect of milk on ricin activity in Vero cells was at the same level as by anti-ricin antibodies. We also found that (a) milk did not inhibit ricin at concentrations of 10 or 100 ng/ml; (b) autoclaving 10 and 100 ng/ml ricin in DMEM at 121 °C for 30 min completely abolished activity; and (c) milk did not affect the activity of another ribosome inactivating protein, Shiga toxin type 2 (Stx2), produced by pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7. Unlike ricin, which is internalized into the cells via a galactose-binding site, Stx2 is internalized through the cell surface receptor glycolipid globotriasylceramides Gb3 and Gb4. These observations suggest that ricin toxicity may possibly be reduced at room temperature by a widely consumed natural liquid food."

Intra- and interspecific aggressiveness were tested and an equiprobable null model used to show how D. armigerum colonies react vis-à-vis other arboreal ant species with large colonies; it happens that D. armigerum can share trees with certain of these species.

https://openalex.org/W2003883380,"By integrating gene profiling and immunohistochemical data with functional experiments in cell lines in this study we show for the first time that doublecortin (DCX) domain containing 2 (DCDC2), a protein belonging to the DCX family and involved in neuronal cell migration, is aberrantly expressed in prostate tumors whereas absent in normal prostate. Furthermore, in patients treated with radical prostatectomy, high levels of DCDC2 RNA were significantly associated with increased biochemical relapse (LogRank Mantel-Cox=0.012). Mechanistically, we found that the ETS transcription factor ESE3/EHF, which is expressed in normal prostate and frequently lost in prostate tumors, maintained DCDC2 repressed by binding to a novel identified ETS binding site in the gene promoter. Consistently, in prostate tumors and in cellular models of gain and loss of ESE3/EHF, the expression of DCDC2 and ESE3/EHF were inversely correlated. In prostate cancer cells, DCDC2 colocalized with microtubules and promoted cell migration and resistance to the microtubule-targeting drug taxol. Collectively, this study establishes DCDC2 as a novel ESE3/EHF oncogenic target in prostate cancer. These findings may be relevant for the clinical management of prostate cancer as DCDC2 may signal tumors more prone to relapse and resistant to taxol treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1968224737,"P2X receptors (P2XRs) are ATP-activated calcium-permeable ligand-gated ion channels traditionally viewed as sensors of extracellular ATP during diverse physiological processes including pain, inflammation, and taste. However, in addition to a cell surface residency P2XRs also populate the membranes of intracellular compartments, including mammalian lysosomes, phagosomes, and the contractile vacuole (CV) of the amoeba Dictyostelium. The function of intracellular P2XRs is unclear and represents a major gap in our understanding of ATP signaling. Here, we exploit the genetic versatility of Dictyostelium to investigate the effects of physiological concentrations of ATP on calcium signaling in isolated CVs. Within the CV, an acidic calcium store, P2XRs are orientated to sense luminal ATP. Application of ATP to isolated vacuoles leads to luminal translocation of ATP and release of calcium. Mechanisms of luminal ATP translocation and ATP-evoked calcium release share common pharmacology, suggesting that they are linked processes. The ability of ATP to mobilize stored calcium is reduced in vacuoles isolated from P2X(A)R knock-out amoeba and ablated in cells devoid of P2XRs. Pharmacological inhibition of luminal ATP translocation or depletion of CV calcium attenuates CV function in vivo, manifesting as a loss of regulatory cell volume decrease following osmotic swelling. We propose that intracellular P2XRs regulate vacuole activity by acting as calcium release channels, activated by translocation of ATP into the vacuole lumen."
https://openalex.org/W1977754186,"Spinophilin (SPL), a multidomain scaffolding protein known to modulate the activity of different G-protein-coupled receptors, regulates various central nervous system (CNS) functions. However, little is known about the role of SPL expressed in peripheral cell types including pancreatic β cells. In this study, we examined the ability of SPL to modulate the activity of β-cell M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M3Rs), which play an important role in facilitating insulin release and maintaining normal blood glucose levels. We demonstrated, by using both in vitro and in vivo approaches (mouse insulinoma cells and SPL-deficient mice), that SPL is a potent negative regulator of M3R-mediated signaling and insulin release. Additional biochemical and biophysical studies, including the use of bioluminescence resonance energy transfer technology, suggested that SPL is able to recruit regulator of G-protein signaling 4 (RGS4) to the M3R signaling complex in an agonist-dependent fashion. Since RGS4 is a member of the RGS family of proteins that act to reduce the lifetime of activated G proteins, these findings support the concept that the inhibitory effects of SPL on M3R activity are mediated by RGS4. These data suggest that SPL or other G-protein-coupled receptor-associated proteins may serve as novel targets for drug therapy aimed at improving β-cell function for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.—Ruiz de Azua, I., Nakajima, K.-I., Rossi, M., Cui, Y., Jou, W., Gavrilova, O., Wess, J.

In neuroendocrine cells, inhibition of the V-ATPase greatly affects neuroendocrine prohormone processing and regulated secretion (7Schoonderwoert V.T. Holthuis J.C. Tanaka S. Tooze S.A. Martens G.J.

The V-ATPase consists of two sectors, namely the cytoplasmic V1-sector that takes care of ATP hydrolysis and the membrane-bound V0-sector that harbors the proteolipid by which protons are translocated (1Nishi T. Forgac M. The vacuolar (H+)-ATPases–nature's most versatile proton pumps.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). The V-ATPase complex displays V1-V0 sector dissociation, which most likely represents a universal mechanism for the regulation of its activity (10Beyenbach K.W. Wieczorek H.

Apart from its function in proton pumping, also a V1-independent role for the V0-sector in post-SNARE membrane fusion has been found in yeast vacuoles (11Peters C. Bayer M.J. Bühler S. Andersen J.S.

The recent discovery of a direct interaction between the v-SNARE synaptobrevin and the V0-sector of the V-ATPase in rat neurons underscores the important role of V0 in post-SNARE membrane fusion and Ca2+-dependent neurotransmitter release (16Di Giovanni J.

Extensive biosynthetic labeling studies revealed that in the early secretory pathway the intact 62-kDa Ac45 protein is proteolytically cleaved to a C-terminal Ac45 fragment of ∼40 kDa (21Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. Schoonderwoert V.T. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. Biosynthesis of the vacuolar H+-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 in Xenopus pituitary.Eur. J.

The ∼20-kDa N-terminal cleavage fragment has been suggested to be degraded following its cleavage from the Ac45 precursor protein (27Schoonderwoert V.T. Jansen E.J. Martens G.J. The fate of newly synthesized V-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 in the secretory pathway.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1844-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the structural requirements for Ac45 to function as a regulator of the V-ATPase. We examined the importance of a number of domains within the Ac45 protein, including of its short cytoplasmic tail which harbors essential and autonomous routing information (28Jansen E.J. Holthuis J.C. McGrouther C. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. Intracellular trafficking of the vacuolar H+-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using the technique of stable Xenopus transgenesis (29Kroll K.L. Amaya E. Transgenic Xenopus embryos from sperm nuclear transplantations reveal FGF signaling requirements during gastrulation.Development. 1996; 122: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we expressed the mutants in their natural environment, namely specifically in Xenopus intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells. We found that the N-terminal as well as the C-terminal portion of the Ac45 protein is crucial for its functioning. Xenopus laevis were reared in the Xenopus facility of the Department of Molecular Animal Physiology (Central Animal Facility, Radboud University Nijmegen). For transgenesis experiments, adult female X. laevis were directly obtained from South Africa (Africa Reptile Park, Muizenberg, South Africa). Experimental animals were adapted to a black background for at least 3 weeks with a light/dark cycle of 12 h. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive 86/609/EEC for animal welfare, and permit RBD0166(H10) to generate and house transgenic X. laevis. Transgenic lines #530 (Ac45ΔCS: intact-Ac45 from which the proteolytic cleavage site has been deleted), #629 (Ac45ΔC: intact-Ac45 from which the C-tail has been removed), #651 (cleaved-Ac45ΔC: cleaved-Ac45 without its C-terminal tail), and #481 (Ac45Nterm: the naturally-occurring ∼20-kDa Ac45 N-terminal processing product) were generated by stable Xenopus transgenesis using the GFP-transgene constructs described below. The generation of transgenic Xenopus, F1 offspring and transgenic lines #452 (intact-Ac45) and #533 (cleaved-Ac45: the naturally-occurring C-terminal ∼40-kDa Ac45 protein), have been previously described and defined as GFP/intact-Ac45 and GFP/cleaved-Ac45, respectively (24Jansen E.J. Scheenen W.J. Hafmans T.G. Martens G.J. Accessory subunit Ac45 controls the V-ATPase in the regulated secretory pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the generation of the Ac45ΔCS mutant, SpeI restriction sites were first introduced into wild-type Xenopus Ac45 (clone X1311–4, Ref. 21Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. Schoonderwoert V.T. Burbach J.P.

Following a SpeI digestion, the cDNA was re-ligated and amplified by PCR using forward primer 5′-gggggaattccagcaagtgcccgtgctg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ggggtctagattactctgtctggggcacagc-3′. For obtaining cDNA encoding Ac45ΔC and cleaved-Ac45ΔC fused to GFP, the Xenopus Ac45 ORF (without the signal peptide) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-gggggaattccagcaagtgcccgtgctg-3′ or forward primer 5′-gggggaattccctatgccaagctatcctcc-3′, respectively, with reverse primer 5′-ggggtctagactaaaccatgtgcagtccatagg-3′ introducing a stop codon proceeding Val411 of Xenopus Ac45. The Ac45ΔCS, Ac45ΔC or cleaved-Ac45ΔC PCR products were cloned into EcoRI/XbaI restriction sites of the pPOMC(A)2+-SP-GFP vector (30Collin R.W. Martens G.J. The coding sequence of amyloid-β precursor protein APP contains a neural-specific promoter element.Brain Res. 2006; 1087: 41-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). For fusing intact-Ac45 and Ac45Nterm C-terminally to GFP, the Xenopus Ac45 ORF (including the signal peptide) was amplified by PCR using the forward primer 5′-ggggggatccgaattcaacagagatggcagcgatgg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gcgcggatccctctgtctggggcacagc-3′ or forward primer: 5′-ggggggatccaggctgctcagtggcaag-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gcgcggatccctctgtctggggcacagc-3′, respectively. The PCR fragments were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of N3delAUG-EGFP (Invitrogen). Next, the EcoRI/XbaI-digested inserts were subcloned into the pPOMC2+ vector (31Jansen E.J.

The anti-Xenopus Ac45-C and anti-Ac45-N rabbit antisera (1311N and 1311C, respectively) have been described previously (21Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. Schoonderwoert V.T. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J.

We generated a rabbit antiserum (ST201) against a synthetic peptide comprising 16 amino acid residues located between transmembrane domains 2 and 3 of the Xenopus NaK-ATPase α-subunit with an additional cysteine at the N terminus (CKVDNSSLTGESEPQTR). Freshly dissected neurointermediate lobes (NILs) were homogenized in lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton-X100, 1% Tween-20, 50 mm Hepes pH 7.4 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics)). Lysates were denatured, separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with anti-Xenopus Ac45-C (1:5000) or anti-GFP (1:5000) rabbit antisera and with secondary peroxidase-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) followed by chemoluminescence. Signals were detected and quantified using a BioImaging system with Labworks 4.0 software (UVP BioImaging systems, Cambridge, UK). Cryosectioning, GFP imaging, and anti-POMC immunostainings on Xenopus brain-pituitary preparations were described previously (25Jansen E.J. Hafmans T.G. Martens G.J.

Melanotrope cells were isolated from freshly dissected Xenopus NILs as described previously (21Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. Schoonderwoert V.T. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. Biosynthesis of the vacuolar H+-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45 in Xenopus pituitary.Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 484-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and plated onto poly-l-lysine coated glass bottom dishes (WillcoWells, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). For determining the localization of the GFP fusion protein, cells were subjected to live cell imaging after 24 h of culturing using an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope. For immunostaining with marker antibodies, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Xenopus PBS (XPBS; 67% PBS) for 2 h, washed with 50 mm NH4Cl/XPBS, permeabilized with 0.05% Tween-20/XPBS and incubated with anti-POMC (ST-62, 1:5000), anti-NaK-ATPase (ST-201 1:1000), or anti-calnexin antibodies (1:1000) in blocking buffer (2% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 in XPBS). After extensive washing with XPBS, cells were incubated for 1 h with a second antibody, Goat-anti-rabbit-Alexa Fluor 568 (1:100 in blocking buffer). Following additional washing steps, cells were mounted in Mowiol and imaged for GFP and Alexa Fluor 568 using an Olympus FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope using the Image J software package. Radioactive labeling of newly synthesized proteins from freshly isolated Xenopus NILs was described previously (25Jansen E.J. Hafmans T.G. Martens G.J.

Chase incubations were in the absence or presence of 0.1 μm apomorphine. The gel migration positions of 37-kDa POMC, 18-kDa POMC, CPE, and the various PC2 forms corresponded to those previously observed (22Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. van Riel M.C. Martens G.J.

POMC represents more than 80% of all newly synthesized melanotrope proteins (22Holthuis J.C. Jansen E.J. van Riel M.C. Martens G.J. Molecular probing of the secretory pathway in peptide hormone-producing cells.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3295-3305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) allowing its direct analysis (i.e. no need for immunoprecipitation). Immunoelectron microscopy on Xenopus NILs using an anti-GFP or an anti-V1A antibody was described previously (24Jansen E.J. Scheenen W.J. Hafmans T.G. Martens G.J. Accessory subunit Ac45 controls the V-ATPase in the regulated secretory pathway.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1783: 2301-2310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Dynamic video imaging to measure intracellular Ca2+ was essentially performed as described previously (36Zhang H.Y. Langeslag M. Voncken M. Roubos E.W. Scheenen W.J. Melanotrope cells of Xenopus laevis express multiple types of high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels.J. Neuroendocrinol. 2005; 17: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Ca2+-oscillations were measured in a low-speed acquisition mode with a sample interval of 6 s. During the experiment, Ringer's solution without or with 0.1 μm apomorphine was continuously perfused at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min; the apomorphine concentration was chosen on the basis of the results of our metabolic cell labeling studies. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical evaluation was performed using an unpaired Student's t test. To study the functional domains within Ac45, we first expressed in the neuroendocrine Xenopus melanotrope cells intact-Ac45 containing a GFP tag at its N or C terminus (GFP/intact-Ac45 and intact-Ac45/GFP, respectively). The cDNAs were placed under the control of a POMC gene promoter fragment (31Jansen E.J. Holling T.M. van Herp F. Martens G.J. Transgene-driven protein expression specific to the intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells of Xenopus laevis.FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) and stable transgenic Xenopus lines were established expressing the fusion proteins specifically in the intermediate pituitary melanotrope cells (Fig. 1B). To study the steady-state protein expression levels in the transgenic NILs, we performed Western blot analysis with anti-GFP and anti-Ac45-C antibodies. Analysis of the GFP/intact-Ac45 NIL lysate with the anti-GFP antibody showed a product of ∼90 kDa, representing the intact-Ac45 protein fused to GFP. The minor ∼50 kDa band corresponds to the size of the N-terminal Ac45 cleavage product fused to GFP. The GFP/intact-Ac45 protein was also recognized by the anti-Ac45-C antibody (Fig. 1C). In the intact-Ac45/GFP NIL lysate, an ∼90 kDa product corresponding to intact-Ac45/GFP and an ∼70 kDa representing the C-terminal Ac45 cleavage product fused to GFP (cleaved-Ac45/GFP) were observed. The ∼28 kDa product probably corresponds to the stable GFP moiety of the fusion protein, likely resulting from the degradation of the Ac45 portion. The anti-Ac45-C antibody did however not recognize the intact-Ac45/GFP product (Fig. 1C). This finding indicates that the GFP tag prevented detection of the C-terminal Ac45 epitope, presumably due to strong secondary structures being present even under the denaturing SDS-PAGE conditions. Since the C-tail of Ac45 contains important routing determinants (28Jansen E.J. Holthuis J.C. McGrouther C. Burbach J.P. Martens G.J. Intracellular trafficking of the vacuolar H+-ATPase accessory subunit Ac45.J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2999-3006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to use for our mutational analysis the Ac45 protein fused to GFP at its N terminus. To gain insight into the significance of the Ac45 cleavage event and the function of the protein domains within Ac45, we generated transgenic Xenopus lines expressing intact-Ac45 (Ac45wt) or a variety of Ac45 mutants fused to GFP, namely Ac45ΔCS, Ac45ΔC, cleaved-Ac45, cleaved-Ac45ΔC, and Ac45Nterm (Fig. 2A). The mutant fusion proteins were colocalized with the main melanotrope cargo protein proopiomelanocortin (POMC) exclusively in the melanotrope cells of the intermediate lobe (IL) and not in the anterior lobe (AL) of the pituitaries (Fig. 2B). Western blot analysis of a Ac45ΔCS NIL lysate using the anti-GFP antibody revealed only an ∼ 90-kDa product corresponding to the expected size of non-cleaved Ac45 fused to GFP, indicating that this Ac45 mutant indeed prevents Ac45 cleavage (Fig. 2C). In the Ac45ΔC NIL lysate, we detected a major ∼90-kDa protein corresponding to the non-cleaved C-terminally truncated Ac45 fusion protein (Fig. 2C). The slightly slower migrating diffuse product likely represents a more extensively glycosylated form of Ac45ΔC. Furthermore, we found a significantly higher processing efficiency of Ac45ΔC compared with Ac45wt. The increased processing efficiency of Ac45ΔC was reflected by an increased ratio of Nterm 50-kDa fragment to intact protein (0.463 ± 0.090 for Ac45ΔC and 0.131 ± 0.011, for Ac45wt; p < 0.01, n = 4). Analysis of the cleaved-Ac45 NIL lysate revealed the expression of an ∼70-kDa transgene product corresponding to the cleaved-Ac45 product. The ∼70- and 72k-Da cleaved-Ac45ΔC products most likely correspond to two glycosylation states of the transgene product. The steady-state expression level of this transgene was relatively low. Finally, in the Ac45Nterm NIL lysate two ∼50-kDa products were detected, presumably also corresponding to differentially glycosylated forms of the N-terminal cleavage product of Ac45 fused to GFP. To examine the subcellular localization of the GFP-tagged mutant Ac45 products, we used confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) on cultured live melanotrope cells. The intact-Ac45 and Ac45ΔCS transgene products were ma"
https://openalex.org/W2054505569,"V(1)-ATPase, the hydrophilic V-ATPase domain, is a rotary motor fueled by ATP hydrolysis. Here, we found that Thermus thermophilus V(1)-ATPase shows two types of inhibitory pauses interrupting continuous rotation: a short pause (SP, 4.2 s) that occurred frequently during rotation, and a long inhibitory pause (LP, >30 min) that terminated all active rotations. Both pauses occurred at the same angle for ATP binding and hydrolysis. Kinetic analysis revealed that the time constants of inactivation into and activation from the SP were too short to represent biochemically predicted ADP inhibition, suggesting that SP is a newly identified inhibitory state of V(1)-ATPase. The time constant of inactivation into LP was 17 min, consistent with one of the two time constants governing the inactivation process observed in bulk ATPase assay. When forcibly rotated in the forward direction, V(1) in LP resumed active rotation. Solution ADP suppressed the probability of mechanical activation, suggesting that mechanical rotation enhanced inhibitory ADP release. These features were highly consistent with mechanical activation of ADP-inhibited F(1), suggesting that LP represents the ADP-inhibited state of V(1)-ATPase. Mechanical activation largely depended on the direction and angular displacement of forced rotation, implying that V(1)-ATPase rotation modulates the off rate of ADP."

Here we have used a neural network model which is capable of producing coupling of theta phase to gamma amplitude firstly to explore its ability to reproduce reported learning changes and secondly to memory-span and phase coding effects. The spiking neural network incorporates two kinetically different GABA(A) receptor-mediated currents to generate both theta and gamma rhythms and we have found that by selective alteration of both NMDA receptors and GABA(A,slow) receptors it can reproduce learning-related changes in the strength of coupling between theta and gamma either with or without coincident changes in theta amplitude. When the model was used to explore the relationship between theta and gamma oscillations, working memory capacity and phase coding it showed that the potential storage capacity of short term memories, in terms of nested gamma-subcycles, coincides with the maximal theta power. Increasing theta power is also related to the precision of theta phase which functions as a potential timing clock for neuronal firing in the cortex or hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2126129023,"SlpA is a 2-domain protein consisting of an FK506-binding protein (FKBP) domain that harbors the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase (PPIase) active site and a small insert-in-flap (IF) domain that endows the protein with chaperone activity. We have determined the structure of SlpA from Escherichia coli at 1.35-Å resolution. The overall structure is similar to other known structures of the FKBP-IF subfamily. However, by serendipity, the linker region of the purification tag binds in the chaperone binding groove of the IF domain, making this the first structure of an FKBP-IF protein in complex with a mimic of an unfolded chaperone substrate. The linker binds by β-sheet augmentation, thus completing the incomplete β barrel of the IF domain and shielding a considerable hydrophobic surface area from the solvent. Interestingly, a proline residue in trans configuration appears to be specifically recognized in a small pocket within the binding groove. Hence, the IF domain can preselect and prealign substrates with proline residues, which may explain how it enhances the catalytic efficiency and modulates the specificity of the FKBP domain in addition to its chaperone function. Based on pulldown results, we suggest that SlpA is likely to be involved in ribosome assembly.—Quistgaard, E. M., Nordlund, P., Löw, C.

https://openalex.org/W1981552789,"The antimetabolite prodrug 3-deazauridine (3DUrd) inhibits CTP synthetase upon intracellular conversion to its triphosphate, which selectively depletes the intracellular CTP pools. Introduction of a fluorine atom at C3 of 3DUrd shifts its antimetabolic action to inhibition of the orotidylate decarboxylase (ODC) activity of the UMP synthase enzyme complex that catalyzes an early event in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis. This results in concomitant depletion of the intracellular UTP and CTP pools. The new prodrug (designated 3F-3DUrd) exerts its inhibitory activity because its monophosphate is not further converted intracellularly to its triphosphate derivative to a detectable extent. Combinations with hypoxanthine and adenine markedly potentiate the cytostatic activity of 3F-3DUrd. This is likely because of depletion of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (consumed in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase/adenine phosphoribosyl transferase reaction) and subsequent slowing of the 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-dependent orotate phosphoribosyl transferase reaction, which depletes orotidylate, the substrate for ODC. Further efficient anabolism by nucleotide kinases is compromised apparently because of the decrease in pKa brought about by the fluorine atom, which affects the ionization state of the new prodrug. The 3F-3DUrd monophosphate exhibits new inhibitory properties against a different enzyme of the pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, namely the ODC activity of UMP synthase.

The 3F-3DUrd monophosphate exhibits new inhibitory properties against a different enzyme of the pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism, namely the ODC activity of UMP synthase. De novo biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides is executed by a number of enzymes eventually leading to the formation of UMP (Fig. 1). Subsequent conversion of UMP to UDP and UTP provides the substrate for CTP synthetase (CTP-S), 2The abbreviations used are: CTP-SCTP synthetase6AUrd6-azauridineDHO-DHdihydroorotate-dehydrogenase3-DUrd3-deazauridine3F-3DUrd3-fluoro-3-DUrd5-FU5-fluorouracil5-FUMP5-fluoro-uridylateHpxhypoxanthineOAorotic acidODCOMP decarboxylaseOMPorotidylateOPRTorotate phosphoribosyl transferaseOtdoritidineUCKuridine/cytidine kinaseUDPGUDP-glucoseUMPSUMP synthase. which is the sole branching point for de novo synthesis of cytosine nucleotides.

The latter step is inhibited by several antimetabolites including pyrazofurin (5Dix D.E. Lehman C.P. Jakubowski A. Moyer J.D. Handschumacher R.E.

The two-step conversion of OA to UMP by OPRT and ODC activity is catalyzed by a multifunctional enzyme (UMP synthase, UMPS) that consists of a 24-kDa OPRT and a 28-kDa ODC domain connected through a short amino acid linker (7Evans D.R.

Several of the abovementioned antimetabolites have been shown to exhibit potent cytostatic and/or antiviral activity in cell culture (12De Clercq E.

Recently, we synthesized the 3-fluoro derivative (3F-3DUrd; Fig. 3) of 3DUrd and evaluated its antiviral and cytostatic activities. This 3F-3DUrd was devoid of significant antiviral activity but showed pronounced cytostatic activity (13Robins M.J. Yang H. Miranda K. Peterson M.A. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3,3-difluoropyridine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione and 3-deaza-3-fluorouracil base and nucleoside derivatives.J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3018-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, to our surprise, further studies revealed that administration of 3F-3DUrd not only depleted the cellular CTP pools as expected for a CTP-S inhibitor such as 3DUrd, but it also significantly decreased the UTP pools. That finding suggested an additional or alternative mechanism of cytostatic action for this novel compound beyond that of 3DUrd and cyclopentenyl cytosine. We now report that substitution of a fluorine atom for hydrogen at the C3 of 3DUrd shifts the mechanism of cytostatic action from selective inhibition of CTP synthetase (for 3DUrd) to inhibition of UMP synthase (for 3F-3DUrd). Urd, orotidine (Otd), 2′-deoxythymidine, hypoxanthine (Hpx), Gua, Ado, Ade, Guo, and Ino were purchased from Sigma; cytidine (Cyd) was from ICN (Cleveland, OH). Orotic acid was obtained from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). 3-Deazauridine was from Sigma. 3-Fluoro-3-dezauridine (3F-3DU) was synthesized as described (13Robins M.J. Yang H. Miranda K. Peterson M.A. De Clercq E. Balzarini J. Synthesis and biological evaluation of 3,3-difluoropyridine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione and 3-deaza-3-fluorouracil base and nucleoside derivatives.J. Med. Chem. 2009; 52: 3018-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). K-oxonate (Acros, Morris Plains, NJ), 6-azauridine (6AU) (Sigma), pyrazofurin (Eli Lilly Co, Indianapolis, IN), and A771726 (Enzo Life Sciences, San Diego, CA) were used in the antimetabolic studies. The following radiolabeled compounds were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA): [2-14C]orotic acid (58 mCi/mmol), [6-3H]5-fluorouracil (13 Ci/mmol), [6-3H]5-fluorouridine (11.1 Ci/mmol), and [5-3H]uridine (17 Ci/mmol). The cytostatic activities of the test compounds were evaluated against murine leukemia L1210 and mammary carcinoma FM3A cells, human T-lymphocyte CEM, mammary carcinoma MCF-7, prostate cancer PC-3, osteosarcoma OST thymidine kinase-deficient, cervix carcinoma HeLa, and embryonic lung fibroblast HEL cells. The cells were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates at 2 × 104–5 × 104 cells/200 μl-well in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (Invitrogen). After two (L1210 and FM3A) or 3 (CEM, MCF-7, PC-3, OST thymidine kinase-deficient, HeLa, and HEL) days, the cell number was determined with a Coulter Z1 Particle counter (Analis, Ghent, Belgium). The monolayer cells were first trypsinized for 10 min before counting. The IC50 or 50% inhibitory concentration was determined as the compound concentration required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%. Five-ml CEM cell cultures were seeded at ∼400,000 cells/ml RPMI 1640 culture medium (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 0.075% NaHCO3) and incubated at 37 °C in a CO2-controlled (5%) humidified atmosphere. After several time periods, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min; 1,200 rpm) and washed twice with cold RPMI 1640 medium (without serum). The cells were then suspended in suspension buffer (PBS) and sonicated (3 × 10 s) to lyse >95% of the cells. After one more centrifugation step (10 min; 13,000 rpm) to remove the cell debris, the supernatants were divided into aliquots and frozen at −80 °C until used as enzyme (UMP synthase) source. Alternatively, the cells were exposed to 66% cold methanol after the last washing step and kept on ice for 10 min. Then the precipitated cell pellet was centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm, and the supernatant was used for determining the intracellular nucleotide pools by HPLC analysis. Five-ml CEM cell cultures (400,000 cells/ml) were exposed to fixed concentrations of test compounds for 6, 24, or 48 h, after which cell extracts were prepared as described above. In these cell extracts, the nucleotide pools were separated and quantified by HPLC analysis (Alliance 2690; Waters, Milford, MA) using a Partisphere-SAX anion exchange column (4.6 × 125 mm; Wattman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK). The following gradient was used: 5 min with 100% buffer A (5 mm NH4H2PO4, pH 5); a 15-min linear gradient of 100% buffer A to 100% buffer B (300 mm NH4H2PO4, pH 5); 20 min with 100% buffer B; a 5-min linear gradient to 100% buffer A; and equilibration at 100% buffer A for 5 min. The UV absorbance of the peaks was recorded at 262 nm. CEM cell extracts of antimetabolite-exposed CEM cell cultures were prepared as described above. Concentrations of the pyrimidine nucleoside metabolites and their degradation products that eluted from the Partisil-SAX HPLC column within 4 min were determined using HPLC tandem mass spectrometry, essentially as described before (14van Kuilenburg A.B. van Lenthe H. Löffler M. van Gennip A.H. Analysis of pyrimidine synthesis “de novo” intermediates in urine and dried urine filter-paper strips with HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.Clin. Chem. 2004; 50: 2117-2124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). CEM cell cultures (5-ml; 400,000 cells/ml) were incubated for 24 h in the presence of 3DUrd (10 μm), 3F-3DUrd (10 μm), or no drug at 37 °C. After the incubation period, the cell extracts were prepared and subjected to HPLC analysis as described above. The fraction numbers containing radiolabeled orotic acid/Otd, UMP, UDP, UTP, and UDPG were 4, 7, 14, 22, and 10 min, respectively. The identities of the peaks were confirmed in similar HPLC gradients with the corresponding nonradiolabeled compound standards. Exponentially growing CEM cell cultures in 75-cm2 culture flasks (20 ml) were centrifuged, and 108 cells were suspended in 1 ml of PBS and sonicated for 3 × 10 s. The lysed cells were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was frozen at −80 °C until used. To 30 μl of nucleoside kinase mixture (8.3 mm MgCl2, 16.6 mm DTT, 0.08 mg of BSA, 1 mm ATP, and 16.6 mm NaF in 83 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0) was added: 5 μl of Milli-Q H2O, 5 μl of drug (i.e., K-oxonate, 6AUrd, or 3F-3DUrd) and 10 μl of uridine/cytidine kinase-1 (UCK-1) enzyme (10 μg). The 50-μl reaction mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C (∼20 h) to allow full conversion of 6AUrd and 3F-3DUrd to their respective 5′-monophosphates. To this reaction mixture was then added 50 μl of OPRT reaction mixture containing 10 μl of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (10 mm) (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH), 10 μl of [14C]orotic acid (1 μCi), and 10 μl of unlabeled orotic acid (1 mm). Incubation was continued for 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C. After the different incubation time periods, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was withdrawn and added to 40 μl of ice-cold MeOH to precipitate the proteins and the nucleic acids. This mixture was then centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm and 4 °C, and the supernatants were injected into the HPLC column using the same gradient as described above for separation and quantification of orotic acid and the radiolabeled nucleotides (i.e., OMP, UMP, UDP, and UTP). [14C]OA, [14C]OMP, and [14C]UMP corresponded to the radiolabeled fractions 4–5, 7–8, and 13–14. In another set of experiments, 10 μl of the [14C]OA solution was replaced by 10 μl of the [3H]5-FU (1 μCi) solution to measure formation of [3H]5-FUMP in the CEM cell extracts in the presence or absence of 6AUrd, 3F-3DUrd, or K-oxonate. The UCK-1 and UMP-CMP kinase expression plasmids were constructed as described earlier (15Van Rompay A.R. Norda A. Lindén K. Johansson M. Karlsson A.

The expression plasmids were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen), and single colonies were inoculated into LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The bacteria were grown at 37 °C, and protein expression was induced at A600 ≈ 0.8 with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The expressed UCK-1 protein was purified using a Talon metal affinity resin column (Clontech) as described (16Van Rompay A.R. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Phosphorylation of deoxycytidine analog monophosphates by UMP-CMP kinase. Molecular characterisation of the human enzyme.Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 562-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the UMP-CMP kinase protein was purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) as described (15Van Rompay A.R. Norda A. Lindén K. Johansson M. Karlsson A. Phosphorylation of uridine and cytidine nucleoside analogs by two human uridine-cytidine kinases.Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1181-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The purities of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the concentration standard. The cytostatic properties of the new 3-fluoro-substituted 3DUrd derivative (3F-3DUrd) (Fig. 3) were compared with those of 3-deazauridine (3DUrd, a CTP synthetase inhibitor), 6AUrd (an ODC inhibitor), pyrazofurin (an ODC inhibitor), K-oxonate (an OPRT inhibitor), and the leflunomide derivative A771726 (a DHO-DH inhibitor) (supplemental Fig. S1) against a variety of tumor cell lines. 3F-3DUrd showed a 2–10-fold higher antiproliferative activity than K-oxonate and was ∼ 2–7-fold less or 2-fold more potent than A771726, depending the nature of the tumor cell line. 3F-3DUrd was 2-fold (CEM) to 30-fold (MCF-7) less cytostatic than 3DUrd. Pyrazofurin and 6AUrd were 30–80-fold more cytostatic than 3F-3DUrd against the panel of tumor cell lines (supplemental Table S1). To obtain more information on the nature of the antimetabolic action of 3F-3DUrd and 3DUrd, natural pyrimidine and purine derivatives were administered to drug-exposed CEM cell cultures. A number of well known antimetabolites acting on different enzymes of the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathways were included as controls (Table 1). Among the natural pyrimidine derivatives, Urd and Cyd annihilated the cytostatic activity of all of the antimetabolites. In contrast, the addition of deoxythymidine, OA, and Otd to the antimetabolite-containing tumor cell cultures at subtoxic concentrations did not markedly affect the antiproliferative activity. The purine derivatives Hpx, Ade, Ado, and Ino markedly increased the cytostatic potential of 3F-3DUrd by 20–70-fold, whereas they had modest or negligible effects on the cytostatic activity of 3DUrd. The pronounced increase of cytostatic activity of 3F-3DUrd but not 3DUrd by these purine derivatives was also observed for the ODC inhibitors pyrazofurin and 6AUrd, and the OPRT inhibitor K-oxonate, but not for the DHO-DH inhibitor A771726 (Table 1). These data provided definitive evidence that 3F-3DUrd behaved differently in its antimetabolic action than its parent 3DUrd analogue and that the behavior of 3F-3DUrd was similar to that of the UMPS (OPRT/ODC) inhibitors.TABLE 1Effect of natural pyrimidine and purine derivatives on the cytostatic activity of 3F-3DUrd and other antimetabolite drugs in CEM cell cultureAddition of natural DNA/RNA precursorsIC50a50% Inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit CEM cell proliferation by 50%.3F-3DUrd3-DUrdPyrazofurin6-Aza-UrdK-oxonateA77 1726μmAs such19 ± 8.67.4 ± 3.10.24 ± 0.090.63 ± 0.28204 ± 4347 ± 41+ Urd 500 μm>250>250>250>250>250>250+ Urd 100 μm>250>250>250>250>250>250+ Cyd 500 μm>250>250123 ± 121>250>250>250+ Cyd 100 μm>250>25099 ± 85>250>250>250+ Orotic acid 500 μm13 ± 8.5≥270.24 ± 0.150.62 ± 0.30>250>250+ Orotic acid 100 μm10 ± 8.612 ± 5.80.26 ± 0.170.53 ± 0.25≥250153+ Orotidine 100 μm6.8 ± 2.717 ± 10.30.079 ± 0.010.37 ± 0.17149 ± 47132+ dThd 10 μm11 ± 1.49 ± 4.00.20 ± 0.010.69 ± 0.0682 ± 9.932 ± 6.1+ dThd 5 μm19 ± 8.69.6 ± 0.640.18 ± 0.110.75 ± 0.17121 ± 8261 ± 45+ Hpx 100 μm0.79 ± 0.443.55 ± 0.290.013 ± 0.0070.045 ± 0.00213 ± 2.3114+ Hpx 20 μm2.2 ± 0.504.31 ± 0.880.12 ± 0.0090.15 ± 0.01105 ± 80110+ Gua 100 μm4.9 ± 2.80.89 ± 0.160.17 ± 0.070.15 ± 0.0742 ± 6.0>50+ Gua 20 μm9.3 ± 0.4710 ± 2.40.25 ± 0.130.54 ± 0.13≥250106+ Ado 500 μm0.31 ± 0.132.0 ± 1.50.026 ± 0.0150.031 ± 0.00812 ± 2.118 ± 13+ Ado 100 μm0.87 ± 0.022.9 ± 0.690.082 ± 0.0140.089 ± 0.01276 ± 1662 ± 48+ Ade 500 μm0.25 ± 0.182.3 ± 1.90.011 ± 00.013 ± 06.2 ± 1.131 13+ Ade 100 μm0.53 ± 0.334.0 ± 0.950.020 ± 0.0050.031 ± 0.00319 ± 1331 ± 10+ Ade 20 μm3.2 ± 2.94.2 ± 2.40.14 ± 0.070.22 ± 0.09150 ± 14122.4+ Guo 20 μm16 ± 113.3 ± 3.10.29 ± 0.010.32 ± 0.22≥208117+ Ino 100 μm1.3 ± 0.193.3 ± 0.00.031 ± 0.0050.054 ± 0.02129 ± 11105+ Ino 20 μm3.5 ± 0.473.3 ± 0.050.11 ± 00.22 ± 0.007110 ± 9.9126 ± 9.9a 50% Inhibitory concentration or compound concentration required to inhibit CEM cell proliferation by 50%. Open table in a new tab The impact of exposure of CEM tumor cell cultures to 3DUrd and the new 3F-3DUrd drug on the intracellular nucleotide pools was investigated. The data are shown in a representative anion exchange HPLC chromatogram for 24 h drug-exposed cell cultures (supplemental Fig. S2, top panel, control; middle panel, 3DUrd-treated; and bottom panel, 3F-3DUrd-treated) and in Table 2 for 24 and 48 h 3F-3DUrd-exposed cell cultures (upper part for each time course experiment). It is apparent that 3DUrd caused markedly decreased CTP (peak 17) but not UTP (peak 16) and UDPG (peak 8) pools (supplemental Fig. S2, compare top and middle panels), whereas 3F-3DUrd caused significant decreases in all three CTP, UTP, and UDPG pools (supplemental Fig. S2, compare top and bottom panels). These effects were dose-dependent and were most pronounced after a 24-h incubation time. The nucleotide pools were (partially) restored after 48 h (Table 2). The effect on the NTP pools observed for 3F-3DUrd is not expected to occur for a CTP synthetase inhibitor but rather for an inhibitor of an early step in de novo UTP synthesis catalyzed by DHO-DH, OPRT, or ODC (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2).TABLE 2Effect of 3F-3DUrd on the intracellular CEM nucleotide poolsDrug concentration and incubation timePercentage of control (without drug) nucleotide poolsaThe data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.UTPCTPATPGTPUDPG24 h10 μm 3F-3DUrd8.6 ± 3.512 ± 6.177 ± 6.471 ± 2117 ± 0.72 μm 3F-3DUrd30 ± 3.529 ± 4.2103 ± 4.981 ± 3339 ± 3.50.5 μm 3F-3DUrd75 ± 2.876 ± 9.9101 ± 7.854 ± 1380 ± 0.748 h10 μm 3F-3DUrd63 ± 4850 ± 2674 ± 9.981 ± 3564 ± 222 μm 3F-3DUrd132 ± 8198 ± 3589 ± 1.494 ± 27151 ± 360.5 μm 3F-3DUrd94 ± 13102 ± 9.2119 ± 1.4108 ± 39128 ± 11a The data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab In these experiments, 3F-3DUrd was converted into its 5′-monophosphate but not into di- or triphosphates in detectable amounts (peak 11) (supplemental Fig. S2, bottom panel), whereas 3DUrd was converted into the mono-, di-, and 5′-triphosphates that were consistently detected in HPLC chromatograms (supplemental Fig. S2, middle panel, peaks 6, 14, and 20). These observations strongly suggest that 3F-3DUrd 5′-monophosphate is the active antimetabolite, whereas 3DUrd 5′-triphosphate is the active CTP synthetase inhibitor. A marked accumulation of several other cellular metabolites was observed in the first 4-min elution profiles of extracts with 3F-3DUrd-treated but not in the 3DUrd-treated CEM tumor cell cultures (see HPLC chromatograms in supplemental Fig. S2 (bottom panel, peaks 2 and 3) compared with supplemental Fig. 2 (top and middle panels)). Because the purine bases Ade and Hpx and the purine nucleosides Ado and Ino were found to markedly potentiate the cytostatic activity of 3F-3DUrd (Table 1), the effect of Hpx (100 μm) on the NTP pools of 3F-3DUrd-exposed CEM tumor cell cultures was investigated (Table 3). The addition of Hpx further decreased both the UTP and CTP pools when measured after 24 h, and this effect was still pronounced after 48 h of incubation.TABLE 3Effect of hypoxanthine on the nucleotide pools of 3F-3DUrd-exposed CEM tumor cell culturesDrug concentration and incubation timePercentage of control (without drug) nucleotide poolsaThe data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments.UTPCTPATPGTPUDPG24 h10 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm8.7 ± 2.012 ± 6.3105 ± 7.8136 ± 3915 ± 5.82 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm17 ± 4.414 ± 7.3101 ± 1583 ± 1327 ± 2.10.5 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm37 ± 3.632 ± 5.9103 ± 6.779 ± 1648 ± 1348 h10 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm6.3 ± 0.69.4 ± 1.686 ± 18106 ± 7.614 ± 5.92 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm18 ± 0.614 ± 1.586 ± 1382 ± 1718 ± 4.00.5 μm 3F-3DUrd + Hpx 100 μm82 ± 2778 ± 31111 ± 1084 ± 28100 ± 46a The data are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab HPLC/mass spectrometry analyses revealed pronounced intracellular accumulations of N-carbamoyl aspartate, DHO, OA, and Otd in CEM cell cultures treated with 3F-3DUrd (Table 4). Such enhanced pyrimidine precursor accumulations were also observed for pyrazofurin, 6-aza-Urd, and K-oxonate but not for the CTP synthetase inhibitor 3DUrd nor for the DHODH inhibitor A771726 (Table 3). These findings strongly suggest a change from inhibition of CTP synthetase (with 3DUrd) to inhibition of an early event in the de novo pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway (with 3F-3dDUrd) that occurs after the DHODH step but before UMP production. Uridylate synthase (OPRT/ODC) appears to qualify as the most likely intracellular target enzyme for 3F-3DUrd (presumably as its 5′-monophosphate).TABLE 4Quantification of intracellular pyrimidine precursors in CEM tumor cell cultures exposed to a variety of antimetabolic drugsMetaboliteIntracellular pyrimidine metabolite concentrationsaIntracellular metabolite concentrations expressed in nmol/106 CEM cells upon exposure of CEM tumor cell cultures to several antimetabolite drugs for 24 h.As such3F-3DUrd (20 μm)3DUrd (10 μm)A771726 (50 μm)K-oxonate (250 μm)Pyrazofurin (0.5 μm)6AU (0.5 μm)nmol/106 CEM cellsNC-aspartatebN-1-Phosphocarbonyl-l-aspartate.<0.0947<0.0862333532Dihydroorotic acid<0.091.4<0.085.51.41.10.92Orotic acid<0.094.4<0.08<0.054.54.03.1Orotidine<0.187.60.27<0.095.67.55.8Uridine<0.18<0.12<0.15<0.09<0.010.10<0.08Uracil<0.36<0.23<0.31<0.18<0.020.20<0.17a Intracellular metabolite concentrations expressed in nmol/106 CEM cells upon exposure of CEM tumor cell cultures to several antimetabolite drugs for 24 h.b N-1-Phosphocarbonyl-l-aspartate. Open table in a new tab CEM tumor cell cultures were exposed to 10-μm 3DUrd or 3F-3DUrd for 24 h in the presence of [14C]orotate ([14C]OA). After the incubation period, the cell extracts were prepared, and the radiolabeled UMP, UDP, UTP, and UDPG pools were quantified by HPLC analysis (Fig. 4). The addition of 3DUrd resulted in significantly increased labeling of the UTP and UDPG pools, which is indicative of CTP synthetase inhibition. In contrast, the addition of 3F-3DUrd resulted in virtually complete prevention of UMP, UDP, UTP, and UDPG pool labeling by [14C]OA with markedly increased formation of 14C-labeled OA and OA metabolites that had an early retention time in HPLC chromatograms (i.e., UV-visible peak (5Dix D.E.

These findings again suggest inhibition of the conversion of [14C]OA to [14C]UMP and are in agreement with the HPLC/mass spectrometry results that show intracellular accumulations of DHO, OA, and Otd in 3F-3DUrd-exposed CEM tumor cell cultures. To investigate whether the presumed 5′-monophosphate of 3F-3DUrd inhibits UMPS (OPRT/ODC), 3F-3DUrd was incubated overnight with UCK to completely convert it to its 5′-monophosphate derivative. CEM cell extracts were then exposed to the 3F-3DUrd 5′-monophosphate, and [14C]OA was added to start the sequence of synthetic reactions. Upon addition of [14C]OA to the cell extracts, time-dependent conversion of [14C]OA to [14C]OMP and [14C]UMP occurred. After 30, 60, and 120 min of incubation, UMP was the predominant metabolite derived from [14C]OA (∼5-fold more UMP than OMP was formed at each time point). In the presence of K-oxonate, OMP was detected only in trace amounts, and UMP was virtually undetected (Fig. 5). This is compatible with the known inhibition of OPRT by K-oxonate. In the presence of the ODC inhibitor 6-AUrd, OMP was formed in a time-dependent manner, whereas only trace amounts of UMP were detected. Thus, the efficient OPRT-catalyzed conversion of OA to OMP was no longer followed by the ODC-catalyzed decarboxylation of OMP to UMP (Fig. 5). In the presence of 3F-3DU (monophosphate), a similar product profile was observed as obtained with 6-AUrd; both OMP and UMP were formed from [14C]OA, but the ratio of OMP/UMP was much higher in the 3F-3DU-exposed cell extracts than in the controls. This indicates a markedly increased inhibition of orotidine decarboxylase activity relative to an essentially unaffected level of orotidylate phosphoribosyl transferase activity (Fig. 5). Because 5-FU is converted to 5-FUMP by the OPRT activity of UMPS (17Sakamoto E Nagase H Kobunai T Oie S Oka T Fukushima M Oka T. Orotate phosphoribosyltransferase"
https://openalex.org/W2059836356,"Plasminogen activation catalyzed by urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) plays an important role in normal and pathological tissue remodeling processes. Since its discovery in the mid-1980s, the cell membrane-anchored urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) has been believed to be central to the functions of uPA, as uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation activity appeared to be confined to cell surfaces through the binding of uPA to uPAR. However, a functional uPAR has so far only been identified in mammals. We have now cloned, recombinantly produced, and characterized two zebrafish proteases, zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b, which by several criteria are the fish orthologs of mammalian uPA. Thus, both proteases catalyze the activation of fish plasminogen efficiently and both proteases are inhibited rapidly by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). But zfuPA-a differs from mammalian uPA by lacking the exon encoding the uPAR-binding epidermal growth factor-like domain; zfuPA-b differs from mammalian uPA by lacking two cysteines of the epidermal growth factor-like domain and a uPAR-binding sequence comparable with that found in mammalian uPA. Accordingly, no zfuPA-b binding activity could be found in fish white blood cells or fish cell lines. We therefore propose that the current consensus of uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation taking place on cell surfaces, derived from observations with mammals, is too narrow. Fish uPAs appear incapable of receptor binding in the manner known from mammals and uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation in fish may occur mainly in solution. Studies with nonmammalian vertebrate species are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of plasminogen activation.

Studies with nonmammalian vertebrate species are needed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of plasminogen activation. Plasminogen activators are serine proteases that catalyze the conversion of the extracellular zymogen plasminogen to the active serine protease plasmin. Plasmin in turn catalyzes degradation of extracellular matrix proteins like fibrin and laminin. In mammals, there are two types of plasminogen activators, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) 2The abbreviations used are: uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatoref1αelongation factor 1-αPAI-1plasminogen activator inhibitor-1S-2288H-D-Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilideS-2251H-d-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilideS-2444pyroGlu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilidetPAtissue-type plasminogen activatoruPARurokinase-type plasminogen activator receptorzfuPA-azebrafish urokinase-type plasminogen activator-like protease-azfuPA-bzebrafish urokinase-type plasminogen activator-like protease-bqPCRquantitative PCR. and tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Plasminogen activation is strictly controlled temporally and spatially. Thus, secretion of tPA from endothelial cells can initiate intravascular fibrinolysis, securing blood vessel patency (for a review, see Ref. 1Collen D. The plasminogen (fibrinolytic) system.Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Cell-specific uPA production can initiate localized extracellular matrix turnover (for a review, see Ref. 2Andreasen P.A.

Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation is believed to take place mainly on cell surfaces, where uPA accumulates due to high-affinity binding by the receptor, uPAR. uPAR also functions as an adhesion receptor due to its affinity to the extracellular matrix protein vitronectin. It may also regulate the activity of integrins. uPAR is a three-domain protein bound to cell surfaces by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (for a review, see Ref. 3Kjaergaard M. Hansen L.V.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is a fast and specific inhibitor of both plasminogen activators (for a review, see Ref. 4Dupont D.M. Madsen J.B. Kristensen T. Bodker J.S. Blouse G.E.

As listed from the N terminus, uPA from mammals has an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (residues 7–47 in human uPA), a kringle domain (residues 50–131 in human uPA), an interdomain linker (residues 132–147 in human uPA), and a C-terminal catalytic domain (in human uPA, residues 148–411 or 1–251 in the chymotrypsin template numbering). It is secreted as a single-chain proform or zymogen with an activity at least 250-fold lower than that of the fully active two-chain form, which is produced by cleavage of the Lys158/15–Ile159/16 bond (throughout the text, when double numbers separated by a slash are used to describe an amino acid position, the first number refers to the actual amino acid number while the second number refers to number of the corresponding amino acid in chymotrypsionogen.) After cleavage, residues 1–158/15 remain bound to the catalytic domain by a Cys148/1–Cys279/122 disulfide bond. No function has yet been assigned to the kringle domain (for a review, see Ref. 2Andreasen P.A. Kjøller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. The urokinase-type plasminogen activator system in cancer metastasis. A review.Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). It is the EGF-like domain that binds to uPAR (6Appella E. Weber I.T. Blasi F. Structure and function of epidermal growth factor-like regions in proteins.FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Plasminogen exists in all vertebrates (7Jiang Y.

Biol. 2009; 74: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but so far, plasminogen activation has been studied almost exclusively in mammals and birds, whereas reports describing direct characterization of plasminogen activators from lower vertebrates have been sparse. Takahashi et al. (9Takahashi K. Wakamatsu Y. Ozato K. Wakayama Y. Fish plasminogen activators, their identification and characterization.Cell Struct. Funct. 1987; 12: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) reported that two antigens from platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus) with Mr values of 50,000 and 55,000, respectively, cross-reacted with two monoclonal antibodies against human uPA; two major plasminogen activators, as detected by SDS-PAGE and fibrin-agarose zymography, migrated with similar Mr values. In goldfish, SDS-PAGE and casein zymography of homogenates of injured optic nerve revealed plasminogen activation activity migrating as two bands with Mr between 60,000 and 65,000 (10Sallés F.J. Schechter N. Strickland S. A plasminogen-activator is induced during goldfish optic nerve regeneration.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2471-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The sequencing of the genomes of vertebrate species beyond mammals and birds now allows more detailed biochemical studies into plasminogen activation in reptiles, amphibians, and bony fishes. Recently, both uPA-like and uPAR-like, but as yet unverified, sequences were found in the genome of the lizard Anolis carolinensis. There is no knowledge about uPA or uPAR in amphibians. For zebrafish (Danio rerio), the databases contain evidence for one plasminogen gene, one zebrafish tPA (zftPA) gene, and one zebrafish PAI-1 (zfPAI-1) gene, neither of which have any obviously striking differences from their mammalian counterparts. In contrast, we have found no evidence for a uPAR-like protein in teleosts in the sequence databases, and found two genes encoding proteins resembling mammalian uPA, which we will refer to as zebrafish urokinase-type plasminogen activator-like protease-a (zfuPA-a) and zebrafish urokinase-type plasminogen activator-like protease-b (zfuPA-b). Here, we present experimentally verified full-length cDNA sequences of zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b. These proteins have the unusual feature of either lacking of a growth factor domain or having a growth factor domain with an unusual sequence and an unusual disulfide bond connectivity. Accordingly, we were unable to identify binding activity on autologous cells for zebrafish uPAs. We therefore hypothesize that uPA-catalyzed plasminogen activation in fishes functions without an uPAR like that known from mammals. Sexually mature male and female zebrafish (D. rerio) were sacrificed by chilling on ice and dissected. Testis, ovary, liver, heart, gill, eye, and brain tissues were subsequently stored in RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX) to protect the RNA from degradation. Total RNA was isolated from the RNAlater preserved samples using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). This protocol included a DNase treatment step according to the manufacturer's recommendations to eliminate genomic DNA contamination. For cloning purposes, cDNA was generated from an mRNA pool extracted from testes of 16 adult zebrafish. Full-length zfuPAa cDNA was isolated and assembled from a total of 15 overlapping partial cDNA fragments. Six fragments were PCR amplified using primers designed from a published predicted partial zfuPA-a cDNA sequence (GenBank accession number XM_693024.2) that was identified by searching the NCBI protein database using human uPA. Although this sequence in its entirety was incorrectly predicted as demonstrated in the present study, part of the 3′-end of the sequence was correct and therefore useful for primer design. Six fragments were PCR amplified using primers that were designed from the published genomic sequence containing the putative zfuPA-a gene (GenBank accession number CR762430). A fragment including the entire coding region was finally PCR amplified to experimentally verify the sequence assembled from the fragments described above. The 5′- and 3′-ends were isolated using the SMART RACE cDNA Amplification Kit from Clontech together with the Advantage2 PCR Enzyme System (Clontech). For 5′- and 3′-RACE, nested PCR was used to amplify discrete RACE PCR products. PCR fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the E.Z.N.A. Gel Extraction Kit (Omega Bio-tek) or the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO or pCR4-TOPO vector using the TOPO TA Cloning system with the electrocompetent TOP10 Escherichia coli strain (Invitrogen). Sequencing reactions were performed using the BigDye Terminator version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) with standard M13 forward and reverse primers and sequencing was performed on an ABI 3130 (Applied Biosystems) or an ABI 3730 XL (Applied Biosystems) by AGOWA (AGOWA, Berlin, Germany). The full cDNA sequence was deposited at GenBank (GenBank accession number FJ660930). Primers were designed to amplify most of the predicted coding sequence (GenBank accession number XM_001346681.2). The sequence was cloned and verified by sequencing and the full cDNA sequence was established using 3′- and 5′-RACE PCR as described above. In all cases, several individual clones were sequenced. The full cDNA sequence was deposited at GenBank (GenBank accession number HQ403602). Intron-exon structures of the zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b genes were determined from the genomic sequences containing the genes (GenBank accession numbers NC_007124 and NC_007123, respectively) using Spidey (11Wheelan S.J. Church D.M. Ostell J.M. Spidey. A tool for mRNA to genomic alignments.Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (12Edgar R.C. MUSCLE, multiple sequence alignment with high accuracy and high throughput.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 1792-1797Crossref PubMed Scopus (30199) Google Scholar) with default parameters. Tissue levels of the zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b mRNAs were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. Real-time qPCR primers for use in SYBR Green assays were designed following the general recommendations on qPCR primer design with respect to base composition, secondary structures, amplicon lengths, and melting temperatures. Quantification of zfuPA-a mRNA was performed using the primers CAGCACACTGGTTTGCCTAGA and TGCAGGCTGAAACATTACCCT (forward and reverse, respectively) spanning bases 1288–1393. Quantification of zfuPA-b mRNA was performed using the primers GGCAACATGATCACCGAGAA and GCATAAACACCAGGCCGAAA (forward and reverse, respectively) spanning base pairs 1295–1470. PCR amplifications were performed in 96-well optical plates using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and relative gene expression was quantified with the MyiQ Real-time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) using the standard curve method. Real-time qPCR thermocycling conditions for zfuPA-a consisted of an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s and 60 °C annealing/DNA synthesis for 45 s. For zfuPA-b, the conditions were 95 °C for 3 min and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 62 °C for 45 s. The amplification was followed by a determination of amplicon melting temperature by denaturing at 95 °C for 1 min, reannealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and increasing the temperature 0.5 °C for every 10 s from 55 to 95 °C. All primer pairs amplified a single PCR product of the expected length when visualized on an agarose gel and produced a single well defined peak on amplicon melting curves and were therefore considered specific. To normalize the samples for variability in reverse transcription efficiency and RNA quality and quantity, relative zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b mRNAs levels were divided by relative elongation factor 1-α (ef1α; primer sequences in Ref. (13Alberti M. Kausch U. Haindl S. Leibiger R. Budczies J. Seifert M. Hock B. Gene expression patterns, a tool for bioanalysis.Int. J. Environ. Anal.

The full coding sequences of zfuPA-a and zfuPAb were cloned with C-terminal His6 tags to the pTT5 vector, a derivative of the pTT vector (14Durocher Y. Perret S. Kamen A.

Suspension growing HEK293–6E cells (vector and cells kindly provided by Yves Durocher, NCR Biotechnology Research Institute, Montreal, Canada) were cultured in F17 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1% Pluronic F-68 (Invitrogen), 4 mm l-Gln (Lonza), and 25 μg/ml of G418 (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using Mr ∼ 25,000 linear polyethylenimine (Polysciences), essentially as described elsewhere (15Tom R. Bisson L. Durocher Y.

Twenty-four hours post-transfection, Tryptone N1 (Organotechnie SAS) was added to a final concentration of 0.5% (w/v). Conditioned medium was collected 96 h post-transfection and the recombinant proteins were purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography followed by size-exclusion chromatography. The purified proteins were at least 95% pure, as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (supplemental Fig. S1). The active, two-chain enzymes were produced by incubation with human or salmon plasmin followed by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. The activated proteins were at least 80% active as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE after reaction with zebrafish PAI-1 (data not shown). Protein concentrations were determined from absorbance measurements using extinction coefficients calculated by the EXPASY ProtParam tool (16Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S.

We introduced a K15A (chymotrypsinogen template numbering) mutation in zfuPA-a to ensure that it could be purified in the noncleaved form. As judged by silver staining after SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, the purified material contained no detectable two-chain zfuPA-a (data not shown). zfuPA-b was purified exclusively in the noncleaved form, as judged by SDS-PAGE (data not shown) without the need for any mutations. 125I-Labeled human uPA or zfuPA-b were prepared as described (17Jensen P.H.

Primers were designed to amplify the full coding sequence of zfPAI-1, using an available database sequence (GenBank accession number NM_001114559.1). The sequence was cloned and several individual clones were sequenced. The sequence was identical to the database sequence except for the stop codon that was located 24 bp later, corresponding to a C-terminal extension of the protein by 8 amino acid residues. The full coding sequence was cloned into the pTT5 vector and expressed in HEK293-6E as described above, and purified using ion-exchange chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. The purified protein was at least 95% pure as judged by Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Human PAI-1 (with the N-terminal His tag and heart muscle kinase recognition site) was expressed in E. coli as described (18Madsen J.B. Dupont D.M. Andersen T.B. Nielsen A.F. Sang L. Brix D.M. Jensen J.K. Broos T. Hendrickx M.L. Christensen A. Kjems J. Andreasen P.A. RNA aptamers as conformational probes and regulatory agents for plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 4103-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Active PAI-1 was purified from nonactive PAI-1 by affinity chromatography on immobilized β-anhydrotrypsin (19Blouse G.E. Perron M.J. Kvassman J.O. Yunus S. Thompson J.H. Betts R.L. Lutter L.C. Shore J.D. Mutation of the highly conserved tryptophan in the serpin breach region alters the inhibitory mechanism of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12260-12272Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Fish plasminogen was purified from salmon plasma (Meridian Life Science, Inc., Saco, ME) by affinity chromatography on lysine-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) according to Deutsch and Mertz (20Deutsch D.G. Mertz E.T. Plasminogen. Purification from human plasma by affinity chromatography.Science. 1970; 170: 1095-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). In Coomassie Blue-stained gels from nonreducing SDS-PAGE, the purified protein migrated as a Mr of ∼85,000 band (data not shown). Human plasminogen was purified from human plasma by the same method. The amidolytic activities of human uPA, zfuPA-a, and zfuPA-b were assayed using the chromogenic substrates S-2288 (Ile-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide) or S-2444 (pyro-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide) (Chromogenix). Assays were performed in 200-μl reaction volumes in a buffer consisting of 10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, incubated at 37 °C. The substrate turnover was followed by monitoring the optical density (OD) at 405 nm. For Km measurements a dilution series of substrate ranging from 6 mm to 6 μm was incubated with 4 nm zfuPA-a, 2 nm zfuPA-b, or 4 nm human uPA. Initial reaction velocities (v0) were calculated from the progress curves by linear regression. Km and Vmax were determined by fitting to the equation: v0 = (Vmax × [S])/(Km + [S]), where [S] represents the substrate concentration. kcat values were calculated by dividing Vmax with the enzyme concentration and using a conversion factor of 2.8854 OD/mm (determined from a standard curve of fully converted substrate). Ki values were determined on the basis of assumption of simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and competitive inhibition, using the equation: V = (Vmax × [S])/([S] + Km × (1 + [I]0/Ki)), where [I]0 is the initial inhibitor concentration. The Ki values were estimated in either of two ways. The first way consisted in measuring apparent Km values (Km,obs) in the presence of different inhibitor concentrations and fitting to the equation Km,obs = Km × (1 + [I]0/Ki). The second way consisted in measuring the apparent Ki values (Ki,obs) in the presence of different substrate concentrations and fitting to the equation: Ki,obs = Km × (1 + [I]0/Ki). Second-order rate constants for inhibition by PAI-1 were determined essentially as described elsewhere (21Futamura A. Gettins P.G. Serine 380 (P14) → glutamate mutation activates antithrombin as an inhibitor of factor Xa.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4092-4098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) using substrates S-2444 and S-2288. Concentrations used were 2 nm human uPA, 25 nm human PAI-1, and 3 mm S-2444; 2 nm zfuPA-a, 75 nm human PAI-1, 3 mm S-2288; 1 nm zfuPA-b, 12.5 nm human PAI-1 and 3 mm S-2288; 2 nm human uPA, 75 nm zfPAI-1, 3 mm S-2444; 2 nm zfuPA-a, 25 nm zfPAI-1, and 6 mm S-2888; or 1 nm zfuPA-b, 12.5 nm zfPAI-1, 6 mm S-2288. 1 μm human or salmon plasminogen was incubated with 100 nm zfuPA-a, zfuPA-b, or human uPA at 37 °C in the presence of 1 μm aprotinin. After 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min, samples corresponding to 3 μg of plasminogen were withdrawn and left on ice until analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE (4–16%). The conversion of plasminogen to plasmin was quantified by using scanning densitometry, where the intensity of a high molecular weight band represented plasminogen and the combined intensity of two lower molecular weight bands represented plasmin. The zebrafish fibroblast-like cell lines ZF4 (22Driever W. Rangini Z. Characterization of a cell line derived from zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) embryos.In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1993; 29: 749-754Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and PAC2 (23Culp, P. A., (1994) Random DNA integrations as an approach to insertional mutagenesis in the zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio). Ph.D. thesis, Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyGoogle Scholar) (both derived from zebrafish embryos; both kindly provided by Saskia Rueb, Leiden University, The Netherlands) were cultured at 28 °C in L-15 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. Standard cell culture techniques and materials were used. PAC2 cells were detached using trypsin-EDTA, whereas ZF4 cells were only treated with trypsin. Cells were grown to confluence in 24-well multiwell plates and washed with PBS and incubated with 5 pm 125I-labeled zfuPA-b in ice-cold binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1% BSA, pH 7.4) with or without 200 nm unlabeled zfuPA-b. After a 16-h incubation at 4 °C, the medium was collected. The cells were washed and solubilized in 1 m NaOH. Radioactivity in the medium and radioactivity associated with the cells was quantified using a γ-counter. Human white blood cells were purified from ∼50 ml of fresh, EDTA-treated blood, collected from two healthy male donors. Blood was diluted at a 1:1 ratio with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and overlaid on Ficoll-Paque Plus (GE Healthcare). After centrifugation (45 min, 400 × g, 20 °C), white blood cells were collected and washed twice in PBS before resuspension in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Cells were counted using a hemocytometer. White blood cells from trout were purified from ∼45 ml of fresh heparin and citrate-treated blood collected from one ∼4 kg rainbow trout. Collected blood was stored on ice immediately after extraction and until centrifugation. White blood cells were isolated using a method modified from those previously published (24Braun-Nesje R.

Blood were diluted 10:1 with 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 190 mm NaCl and interlaid in a discontinued Percoll gradient (density top layer 1.060 g/ml, and bottom layer 1.075 g/ml). Following centrifugation (40 min, 400 × g, 4 °C), the layer containing white blood cells was identified in a light microscope, collected, and the cells were counted. For binding experiments, 1 × 106 cells were incubated with 3 pm 125I-labeled zfuPA-b or human uPA. For competition, the single-chain forms of zfuPA-b or human uPA were used at a 200 nm concentration. The cells and the ligand were incubated in PBS containing 1% BSA for 3 h at 4 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation and radioactivity in the medium and radioactivity associated with the cells was quantified using a γ-counter. Homology models of the serine protease domains of zfuPA-a and zfuPA-b were generated by SwissModel (26Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. The SWISS-MODEL workspace. A web-based environment for protein structure homology modeling.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6025) Google Scholar) and docked onto the structure of human PAI-1 (PDB entry 3PB1). To find new uPAR representatives in the public databases, the most conserved uPA/uPAR sequence signatures were isolated and the search motifs created shown in Fig. S6. The UniProt (27UniProt C.

The datasets were searched using Patscan (29Dsouza M. Larsen N. Overbeek R. Searching for patterns in genomic data.Trends Genet. 1997; 13: 497-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) and Patscan output was converted to match tables with taxonomy taken from the databases. Less sensitive BLAST searches were also done against the nonredundant protein data banks at NCBI. A search of the databases using BLAST revealed one zebrafish plasminogen gene, one zebrafish tPA gene, and one zebrafish PAI-1 gene, which displayed no immediately striking differences from their mammalian counterparts (data not shown). In contrast, there are two genes similar to mammalian uPA, both containing"
