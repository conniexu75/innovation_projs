Advances in soft materials have led to skin-like sensors and muscle-like actuators for soft robots and wearable devices1–3. Flexible or stretchable counterparts of most key mechatronic components have been developed4,5, principally using fluidically driven systems6–8; other reported mechanisms include electrostatic9–12, stimuli-responsive gels13,14 and thermally responsive materials such as liquid metals15–17 and shape-memory polymers18. Despite the widespread use of fluidic actuation, there have been few soft counterparts of pumps or compressors, limiting the portability and autonomy of soft machines4,8. Here we describe a class of soft-matter bidirectional pumps based on charge-injection electrohydrodynamics19. These solid-state pumps are flexible, stretchable, modular, scalable, quiet and rapid. By integrating the pump into a glove, we demonstrate wearable active thermal management. Embedding the pump in an inflatable structure produces a self-contained fluidic ‘muscle’. The stretchable pumps have potential uses in wearable laboratory-on-a-chip and microfluidic sensors, thermally active clothing and autonomous soft robots. A stretchable polymer pump that uses electric fields to accelerate ions in dielectric liquids can generate flow even when bent into different conformations, offering applications in soft robotics."
https://openalex.org/W2967768480,"Tissue morphogenesis arises from coordinated changes in cell shape driven by actomyosin contractions. Patterns of gene expression regionalize cell behaviours by controlling actomyosin contractility. Here we report two modes of control over Rho1 and myosin II (MyoII) activation in the Drosophila endoderm. First, Rho1-MyoII are induced in a spatially restricted primordium via localized transcription of the G-protein-coupled receptor ligand Fog. Second, a tissue-scale wave of Rho1-MyoII activation and cell invagination progresses anteriorly away from the primordium. The wave does not require sustained gene transcription, and is not governed by regulated Fog delivery. Instead, MyoII inhibition blocks Rho1 activation and propagation, revealing a mechanical feedback driven by MyoII. We find that MyoII activation and invagination in each row of cells drives adhesion to the vitelline membrane mediated by integrins, apical spreading, MyoII activation and invagination in the next row. Endoderm morphogenesis thus emerges from local transcriptional initiation and a mechanically driven cycle of cell deformation."
https://openalex.org/W2968655733,"Seismology records the presence of various heterogeneities throughout the lower mantle1,2, but the origins of these signals—whether thermal or chemical—remain uncertain, and therefore much of the information that they hold about the nature of the deep Earth is obscured. Accurate interpretation of observed seismic velocities requires knowledge of the seismic properties of all of Earth’s possible mineral components. Calcium silicate (CaSiO3) perovskite is believed to be the third most abundant mineral throughout the lower mantle. Here we simultaneously measure the crystal structure and the shear-wave and compressional-wave velocities of samples of CaSiO3 perovskite, and provide direct constraints on the adiabatic bulk and shear moduli of this material. We observe that incorporation of titanium into CaSiO3 perovskite stabilizes the tetragonal structure at higher temperatures, and that the material’s shear modulus is substantially lower than is predicted by computations3–5 or thermodynamic datasets6. When combined with literature data and extrapolated, our results suggest that subducted oceanic crust will be visible as low-seismic-velocity anomalies throughout the lower mantle. In particular, we show that large low-shear-velocity provinces (LLSVPs) are consistent with moderate enrichment of recycled oceanic crust, and mid-mantle discontinuities can be explained by a tetragonal–cubic phase transition in Ti-bearing CaSiO3 perovskite. Unexpectedly low seismic velocities of CaSiO3 perovskite in deeply subducted oceanic crust can explain the properties of anomalous continent-sized regions in Earth’s lower mantle."
https://openalex.org/W2968021169,"Caretta caretta is the most common sea turtle species in the Mediterranean Sea. The species is threatened by anthropomorphic activity that causes thousands of deaths and hundreds of strandings along the Mediterranean coast. Stranded turtles are often cared for in rehabilitation centres until they recover or die. The objective of this study was to characterize the gut microbiome of nine sea turtles stranded along the Sicilian coast of the Mediterranean Sea using high-throughput sequencing analysis targeting V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Stool samples were collected from eight specimens hosted in the recovery centre after a few days of hospitalization (under 7) and from one hosted for many weeks (78 days). To better explore the role of bacterial communities in loggerhead sea turtles, we compared our data with published fecal microbiomes from specimens stranded along the Tuscan and Ligurian coast. Our results highlight that, despite the different origin, size and health conditions of the animals, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria constitute the main components of the microbiota. This study widens our knowledge on the gut microbiome of sea turtles and could be helpful for the set up of rehabilitation therapies of stranded animals after recovery in specialized centres."
https://openalex.org/W2968547417,"Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) have the potential to benefit undergraduates and longer UREs have been shown to lead to greater benefits for students. However, no studies have examined what causes students to stay in or consider leaving their UREs. In this study, we examined what factors cause students to stay in their UREs, what factors cause students to consider leaving their UREs, and what factors cause students to leave their UREs. We sampled from 25 research-intensive (R1) public universities across the United States and surveyed 768 life sciences undergraduates who were currently participating in or had previously participated in a URE. Students answered closed-ended and open-ended questions about factors that they perceived influenced their persistence in UREs. We used logistic regression to explore to what extent student demographics predicted what factors influenced students to stay in or consider leaving their UREs. We applied open-coding methods to probe the student-reported reasons why students chose to stay in and leave their UREs. Fifty percent of survey respondents considered leaving their URE, and 53.1% of those students actually left their URE. Students who reported having a positive lab environment and students who indicated enjoying their everyday research tasks were more likely to not consider leaving their UREs. In contrast, students who reported a negative lab environment or that they were not gaining important knowledge or skills were more likely to leave their UREs. Further, we identified that gender, race/ethnicity, college generation status, and GPA predicted which factors influenced students’ decisions to persist in their UREs. This research provides important insight into how research mentors can create UREs that undergraduates are willing and able to participate in for as long as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2967550927,"Differential coordination of growth and patterning across metazoans gives rise to a diversity of sizes and shapes at tissue, organ and organismal levels. Although tissue size and tissue function can be interdependent1–5, mechanisms that coordinate size and function remain poorly understood. Planarians are regenerative flatworms that bidirectionally scale their adult body size6,7 and reproduce asexually, via transverse fission, in a size-dependent manner8–10. This model offers a robust context to address the gap in knowledge that underlies the link between size and function. Here, by generating an optimized planarian fission protocol in Schmidtea mediterranea, we show that progeny number and the frequency of fission initiation are correlated with parent size. Fission progeny size is fixed by previously unidentified mechanically vulnerable planes spaced at an absolute distance along the anterior–posterior axis. An RNA interference screen of genes for anterior–posterior patterning uncovered components of the TGFβ and Wnt signalling pathways as regulators of the frequency of fission initiation rather than the position of fission planes. Finally, inhibition of Wnt and TGFβ signalling during growth altered the patterning of mechanosensory neurons—a neural subpopulation that is distributed in accordance with worm size and modulates fission behaviour. Our study identifies a role for TGFβ and Wnt in regulating size-dependent behaviour, and uncovers an interdependence between patterning, growth and neurological function. A planarian fission protocol shows that the number of progeny and the frequency of fission initiation correlate with parent size, and TGFβ and Wnt signalling components are identified as regulators of fission behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2967876585,"Previously, we synthesized triazoloquinazolines 1-14 and characterized their structure. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of the targets 1-14 as α-glucosidase inhibitors using α-glucosidase enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae type 1. Among the tested compounds, triazoloquinazolines 14, 8, 4, 5, and 3 showed the highest inhibitory activity (IC50 = 12.70 ± 1.87, 28.54 ± 1.22, 45.65 ± 4.28, 72.28 ± 4.67, and 83.87 ± 5.12 μM, respectively) in relation to that of acarbose (IC50 = 143.54 ± 2.08 μM) as a reference drug. Triazoloquinazolines were identified herein as a new class of potent α-glucosidase inhibitors. Molecular docking results envisaged the plausible binding interaction between the target triazoloquinazolines and α-glucosidase enzyme and indicated considerable interaction with the active site residues."
https://openalex.org/W2967899553,"The origins of endothermy in birds and mammals are important events in vertebrate evolution. Endotherms can maintain their body temperature (Tb) over a wide range of ambient temperatures primarily using the heat that is generated continuously by their high basal metabolic rate (BMR)1. There is also an important positive feedback loop as Tb influences BMR1–3. Owing to this interplay between BMRs and Tb, many ecologists and evolutionary physiologists posit that the evolution of BMR and Tb must have been coupled during the radiation of endotherms3–5, changing with similar trends6–8. However, colder historical environments might have imposed strong selective pressures on BMR to compensate for increased rates of heat loss and to keep Tb constant9–12. Thus, adaptation to cold ambient temperatures through increases in BMR could have decoupled BMR from Tb and caused different evolutionary routes to the modern diversity in these traits. Here we show that BMR and Tb were decoupled in approximately 90% of mammalian phylogenetic branches and 36% of avian phylogenetic branches. Mammalian BMRs evolved with rapid bursts but without a long-term directional trend, whereas Tb evolved mostly at a constant rate and towards colder bodies from a warmer-bodied common ancestor. Avian BMRs evolved predominantly at a constant rate and without a long-term directional trend, whereas Tb evolved with much greater rate heterogeneity and with adaptive evolution towards colder bodies. Furthermore, rapid shifts that lead to both increases and decreases in BMRs were linked to abrupt changes towards colder ambient temperatures—although only in mammals. Our results suggest that natural selection effectively exploited the diversity in mammalian BMRs under diverse, often-adverse historical thermal environments. Evolutionary change in basal metabolic rate was not coupled with body temperature across endothermic species, although the mechanism by which birds and mammals adapted to colder environments differed."
https://openalex.org/W2968432018,"Background Motor imagery (MI) has been a widely used strategy in the past two decades to enhance physical capabilities among orthopaedic patients. However, its effectiveness is still questioned, since the demonstrated effects were likely task-dependent, with little evidence of transfer to tasks not specifically trained with MI. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate whether an MI practice focused on maximal isometric knee extension strength, causes additional specific and general adaptations upon neuromuscular and functional variables when compared to conventional rehabilitation only, in patients submitted to total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Design Parallel group randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants Thirty-four patients (56% man) submitted to TKA. Program Patients were randomly assigned to an MI practice group (MIp: 15 minutes per day/5 days per week in addition to routine physical therapy) or control group (CON) that performed routine physical therapy alone for four weeks. Outcome measures The maximal isometric knee extension strength of the operated leg was defined as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were spatial and temporal gait parameters, 30-second chair sit-to-stand performance, a self-reported physical function assessed by the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) questionnaire, and an MI ability score. All measurements were conducted before and one month after TKA. Results Significant differences in treatment effects were observed for the MIp group compared to CON: the MIp showed less strength decrease (ES = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.32, 1.99, p = 0.022); faster self-selected speed under single (ES = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.16, 3.08, p = 0.001) and dual task (ES = 1.59, large, 95% CI: 0.67, 2.50, p = 0.002) conditions; brisk-pace gait speed during single (ES = 1.32, 95% CI: 0.47, 2.17, p = 0.020) and dual task conditions (ES = 1.31, large, 95% CI: 0.38, 2.23, p = 0.013); improved chair sit-to-stand (ES = 1.45, large, 95% CI: 0.58, 2.31, p = 0.004) performance; and a higher score on MI ability questionnaires for kinaesthetic imagery (KI) (ES = 0.55, 95% CI: -0.23, 1.34, p = 0.010) and internal visual imagery (EVI) (ES = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.18, 1.80, p = 0.039) scales, respectively. In addition, only MIp showed unaltered single and double support periods, as well as stride length and cadence during single task self-selected gait condition. Finally, analysis showed that the improved MI ability score achieved at the end of MI training was significantly correlated with the changes in the strength of the operated leg (kinaesthetic imagery: r = 0.741, p = 0.004; and internal visual imagery: r = 0.623, p = 0.023). Conclusions MI training, when added in a corollary to routine physical therapy, led to improvements in both specific and general adaptations that were related to patients’ physical capabilities. While future studies must also evaluate the long-term effects, conducting MI training during acute and post-acute rehabilitation phases is advised, especially when the extent and range of physical exercise is limited or made impossible.

To determine how strongly our hGOAT structure depends on the experimental topological constraints from mouse GOAT (11Taylor M.S. Ruch T.R. Hsiao P.Y. Hwang Y. Zhang P. Dai L. Huang C.R. Berndsen C.E.

This indicates that co-evolutionary contact constraints alone are sufficient to predict the membrane topology of hGOAT, suggesting this approach for topology modeling of integral membrane proteins to complement established algorithms for predicting membrane protein topology. Ramachandran analysis indicates that 92.4% (400 of 433) of hGOAT residues lie in favored (98%) regions, 98.2% (425 of 433) lie in allowed (>99.8%) regions, and 1.9% (8 of 433) are outliers (Fig. S4) (28Chen V.B.

The enzyme forms an ellipsoidal cone composed of transmembrane helices, with the narrow end facing the ER lumen (Fig. 1D). The exposed ends of five transmembrane helices (TM1, TM4, TM5, TM7, and TM11) converge to form a pore through which the interior of hGOAT is connected to the ER lumen. At the cytoplasmic membrane interface, the predicted cytoplasmic loops fold up to form a core region bounded by the lipid-contacting perimeter helices. As a result, there is minimal cytoplasmic exposure of hGOAT residues beyond the plane of the membrane. The hGOAT structure contains a contiguous internal channel through the enzyme core that transits from the ER lumen space to the cytoplasm (Fig. 1E). The channel is bent within hGOAT, with the restriction formed by the C-terminal end of helix TM8 and the N-terminal end of TM9. This positions an absolutely conserved histidine residue (His-338) in direct contact with the internal channel (7Hofmann K. A superfamily of membrane-bound O-acyltransferases with implications for wnt signaling.Trends Biochem.

Following completion of our hGOAT structure and during subsequent biochemical validation experiments (described below), the release of a crystal structure for bacterial MBOAT alanyl transferase DltB provided an independent basis for comparison and validation of our hGOAT structure (14Ma D.

The His-338 residue in hGOAT closely matches the location of the analogous histidine residue (His-336) in the DltB structure (Fig. 1F) (5Yang J. Brown M.S. Liang G. Grishin N.V. Goldstein J.L.

Further comparison of the hGOAT model and the DltB structure reveals remarkable similarities in overall topology and structure, with a TM-score of 0.6 and root mean square deviation of 2.23 Å for ∼100 aligned conserved residues between the structural models for these distantly related MBOAT family members (12.3% sequence identity, 26.8% sequence similarity, E-value 2.7 × 10−8 and bit score 48.7; Figs. S5 and S6 and Table S1) (29Xu J. Zhang Y.

However, the low overall homology between DltB and hGOAT leads to very poor structure prediction for nonhomologous sequence positions, as would be expected for this type of comparison. The demonstrated ability of our hGOAT modeling based on coevolutionary contact restraints to arrive at the same protein fold as DltB, in the absence of any experimental structural information, underscores the power of this approach to accurately predict protein structures. To validate our computational hGOAT structural model biochemically, we mutated ∼10% of the residues within hGOAT to alanine and determined the impact of these mutations on hGOAT octanoylation activity in a peptide-based acylation assay (Fig. 2 and Fig. S7) (30Darling J.E. Prybolsky E.P. Sieburg M. Hougland J.L. A fluorescent peptide substrate facilitates investigation of ghrelin recognition and acylation by ghrelin O-acyltransferase.Anal.

These 42 alanine mutations were spread across a range of amino acids and degrees of conservation, with the majority of sites chosen conserved at >75% among GOAT orthologs (File S3). In narrowing the pool of mutations to ∼40 positions, residues with surface-exposed side chains were deemphasized compared with residues predicted to lie within the enzyme interior. Approximately half of the mutation sites were selected based on the residue's side chain contacting the internal void, as we propose this channel will likely contain the substrate-binding sites and catalytic residues within hGOAT. In this pool of alanine mutants, we observed a range of activities from near/above WT ghrelin octanoylation activity to complete loss of detectable activity (Table S2 and Fig. S8). When mapped onto the hGOAT structural model, mutations leading to a marked decline (>3-fold; purple) or loss of enzyme activity (red) appear clustered within the core of hGOAT (Fig. 2). For quantitative analysis of the impact of these mutations, we determined whether alanine mutagenesis of residues contacting the internal void is more likely to yield reduced enzyme activity compared with non-void-contacting mutations. Within the pool of mutations, the void-contacting alanine mutations were significantly more likely to result in loss of enzyme activity (p < 0.03; Fig. 2D). This mutation activity mapping defines a functionally essential core within hGOAT and expands the number of residues within hGOAT known to be required for enzyme activity (5Yang J. Brown M.S.

We expect the octanoyl-CoA acyl donor to enter the hGOAT active site through interaction with the cytoplasmic face of the enzyme, based on the availability of acyl-CoAs within the cell. When docked into our hGOAT model, octanoyl-CoA binds to hGOAT through interactions of both its CoA and octanoyl chain regions with residues in TM6, the TM7-TM8 connecting loop, TM8, and TM9 (Fig. 3). In the docked complex, the CoA portion forms both polar and nonpolar interactions with multiple hGOAT residues while remaining exposed to the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, A and B). The phosphoadenosine group binds into a discrete pocket while the phosphopantetheine chain is in contact with multiple polar amino acid side chains (Fig. 3, C–E). Among these CoA-contacting amino acids, all alanine mutations examined except one lead to a loss of hGOAT activity. In the docked hGOAT:octanoyl-CoA structure, the acyl chain of octanoyl-CoA makes a sharp turn and penetrates upward into the interior of hGOAT following a channel that terminates at Trp-351 (Fig. 3, C–E).

As alanine mutagenesis would provide additional space within the acyl-binding site, we determined the ability of hGOAT alanine variants to accept 12-carbon (lauryl-CoA) and 14-carbon (myristoyl-CoA) acyl donors in place of octanoyl CoA. The WT enzyme and the majority of hGOAT alanine variants exhibited the expected preference for an eight-carbon acyl donor, but alanine mutagenesis of Trp-351 and Phe-331 resulted in loss of appreciable reactivity with octanoyl-CoA but engendered new activity with the longer acyl donors (Fig. 3F and Fig. S9). The F331A variant gained activity with the C12 donor, whereas W351A hGOAT could acylate a ghrelin-derived peptide with both C12 and C14 acyl chains. This altered selectivity supports the modeled positions of Trp-351 and Phe-331 as forming the end of the acyl-binding pocket. The altered preference for longer acyl donors by the F331A and W351A variants was also observed in a direct competition assay where hGOAT variants were provided acyl donors ranging from six to 12 carbons (Fig. 3G). This altered selectivity was not observed for any other alanine variants with detectable ghrelin acylation activity (Fig. S10). Acyl donor reengineering upon targeted alanine mutagenesis localizes Phe-331 and Trp-351 to the distal end of the acyl donor–binding site within hGOAT and provides further biochemical validation of our hGOAT structural model. Although structural studies play a central role in developing our understanding of protein function, the limited availability of integral membrane proteins within structural databases creates a particularly acute challenge for structurally modeling these proteins (see http://blanco.biomol.uci.edu/mpstruc/). 6Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site. In this work, we demonstrate the development and validation of a structural model for an integral membrane protein that leverages bioinformatics constraints from coevolutionary contact analysis and model evaluation by biochemical analysis while circumventing the requirement of protein purification. Our model provides indispensable and novel insights into several long-standing questions regarding the mechanism for MBOAT-catalyzed transmembrane protein acylation. The topological separation of two essential conserved residues, His-338 and Asn-307, is explained by these two residues playing roles in distinct aspects of GOAT activity.

Our study sample includes the triconodont Priacodon fruitaensis from the Upper Jurassic of North America, and two isolated stem therian petrosal specimens colloquially known as the Höövör petrosals, recovered from Aptian-Albian sediments in Mongolia. The second Höövör petrosal is here described at length for the first time. All three of these petrosals and a comparative sample of extant mammalian taxa have been imaged using micro-CT, allowing for detailed anatomical descriptions of the osteological correlates of functionally significant neurovascular features, especially along the abneural wall of the cochlear canal. The high resolution imaging provided here clarifies several hypotheses regarding the mosaic evolution of features of the cochlear endocast in early mammals. In particular, these images demonstrate that the membranous cochlear duct adhered to the bony cochlear canal abneurally to a secondary bony lamina before the appearance of an opposing primary bony lamina or tractus foraminosus. Additionally, while corroborating the general trend of reduction of venous sinuses and plexuses within the pars cochlearis seen in crownward mammaliaforms generally, the Höövör petrosals show the localized enlargement of a portion of the intrapetrosal venous plexus. This new vascular feature is here interpreted as the bony accommodation for the vein of cochlear aqueduct, a structure that is solely, or predominantly, responsible for the venous drainage of the cochlear apparatus in extant therians. Given that our fossil stem therian inner ear specimens appear to have very limited high-frequency capabilities, the development of these modern vascular features of the cochlear endocast suggest that neither the initiation or enlargement of the stria vascularis (a unique mammalian organ) was originally associated with the capacity for high-frequency hearing or precise sound-source localization."

Previous work has focused on specific aspects of multitasking or has not considered gender differences in abilities contributing to multitasking performance. We therefore tested gender differences (N = 96, 50% female) in sequential (i.e., task switching) and concurrent (i.e., dual tasking) multitasking, while controlling for possible gender differences in working memory, processing speed, spatial abilities, and fluid intelligence. Applying two standard experimental paradigms allowed us to test multitasking abilities across five different empirical indices (i.e., performance costs) for both reaction time (RT) and accuracy measures, respectively. Multitasking resulted in substantial performance costs across all experimental conditions without a single significant gender difference in any of these ten measures, even when controlling for gender differences in underlying cognitive abilities. Thus, our results do not confirm the widespread stereotype that women are better at multitasking than men at least in the popular sequential and concurrent multitasking settings used in the present study."

Manganese (Mn) is an essential nutrient that is neurotoxic at high levels of exposure, particularly affecting the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex. Both the intensity and timing of exposure matter; deciduous teeth can be used to retrospectively and objectively determine early-life windows of vulnerability. The aim of this pilot study was to examine associations between prenatal, early postnatal and childhood dentine Mn concentrations and intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) of adolescents' brains. 14 adolescents (12-18 years; 6 girls) from northern Italian regions with either current, historic or no Mn contamination, completed a 10-minute resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan in an 1.5T MRI scanner. We estimated prenatal, early postnatal and childhood Mn concentrations in deciduous teeth using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. We performed seed-based correlation analyses, focusing on six subcortical seeds (left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum) and one cortical seed (bilateral middle frontal gyrus) from Harvard-Oxford atlases. We examined linear and quadratic correlations between log-transformed Mn concentrations and seed-based iFC (Bonferroni-corrected p<0.0023), controlling for either socio-economic status, sex or age. Dentine Mn concentrations (Mn:Calcium ratio) were highest during the prenatal period (median = 0.48) and significantly declined during the early postnatal (median = 0.14) and childhood periods (median = 0.006). Postnatal Mn concentrations were associated with: 1) increased iFC between the middle frontal gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex; 2) decreased iFC between the right putamen and pre- and postcentral gyrus. Together, these findings suggest that early postnatal Mn concentrations are associated with increased iFC within cognitive control brain areas, but decreased iFC between motor areas in adolescents. Future studies should replicate these findings in larger samples, and link brain connectivity measures to cognitive and motor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2967932104,"Introduction Laboratory rat welfare is critically influenced by laboratory animal personnel through their implementation, or lack of implementation, of various enrichment techniques. One such promising technique is heterospecific play, or “rat tickling”, which mimics aspects of rat rough-and-tumble play and can contribute to improving welfare, but may be infrequently implemented. The theory of planned behavior can be used to study implementation by measuring intentions and beliefs about rat tickling, including behavioral attitudes (whether it is good or bad), subjective norms (whether there is social/professional pressure to provide it), and control beliefs (whether they feel in control of providing it). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify current rat tickling prevalence and predictors among laboratory animal personnel in the United States and Canada. Our hypothesis was that rat tickling prevalence would be low and associated with beliefs about the practice, enrichment, and laboratory animals in general. Methods Laboratory animal personnel were recruited from widespread online promotion. A total of 794 personnel (mean = 40±11 years, 80% white, 80% female) completed at least 50% of the mixed methods online survey and met inclusion criteria of currently working with laboratory rats in the USA or Canada. The survey included questions about demographics, enrichment practices and beliefs, attitudes towards rats, general positive behaviors (e.g. talking to laboratory animals), and both practices and beliefs about rat tickling. Qualitative data were coded using thematic analysis. Quantitative data were analyzed using general linear models. Results Laboratory personnel reported low levels of rat tickling implementation, with 89% of participants reporting using it never or rarely. Laboratory personnel reported 2 key benefits (handling: 61%, welfare: 55%) and 3 key barriers (time: 59%, personnel: 22%, and research: 22%) to rat tickling using qualitative analysis. Current and planned rat tickling were positively associated with more positive beliefs (social/professional pressure p<0.0001, control of providing tickling p<0.0001) and familiarity with tickling (p<0.0001). Current rat tickling was also positively associated with more positive general behaviors towards laboratory animals, such as naming animals (p<0.0001). Future rat tickling was positively associated with more positive attitudes about it (p<0.0001) and a desire to implement more enrichment (p<0.01). Conclusion Our findings show that even though rat tickling implementation is currently low, it is positively associated with personnel beliefs, familiarity, general attitudes, and a desire for more enrichment. That is, laboratory animal personnel were more likely to provide rat tickling if they were more familiar with it, thought providing it was both good and under their control, and felt subject to social/professional pressure, as well as if they wanted to provide more enrichment and generally had more positive behaviors towards laboratory animals. There is potential to increase rat tickling by increasing personnel familiarity with the procedure through training, decreasing the time required, and changing personnel beliefs–thereby improving rat welfare."
https://openalex.org/W2968550454,"Landing maneuvers of flies are complex behaviors which can be conceptually decomposed into sequences of modular actions, including body-deceleration, leg-extension, and body rotations. These behavioral ‘modules’ must be coordinated to ensure well-controlled landing. The composite nature of these behaviors induces kinematic variability, making it difficult to identify the central rules that govern landing. Many previous studies have relied on tethered preparations to study landing behaviors, but tethering induces experimental artefacts by forcing some behaviors to operate in open-feedback control loop while others remain closed-loop. On the other hand, it is harder for the experimenter to control the stimuli experienced by freely-flying insects. One approach towards understanding general mechanisms of landing is to determine the common elements of their kinematics on surfaces of different orientations. We conducted a series of experiments in which the houseflies, Musca domestica, were lured to land on vertical (wall landings) or inverted (ceiling landings) substrates, while their flight was recorded with multiple high-speed cameras. We observed that, in both cases, well-controlled landings occurred when the distance at which flies initiated deceleration was proportional to flight velocity component in the direction of substrate. The ratio of substrate distance and velocity at onset of deceleration (tau) was conserved, despite substantial differences in mechanics of vertical vs. ceiling landings. When these conditions were not satisfied, their landing performance was compromised, causing their heads to collide into the substrate. Unlike body-deceleration, leg-extension in flies was independent of substrate distance or approach velocity. Thus, the robust reflexive visual initiation of deceleration is independent of substrate orientation, and combines with a more variable initiation of leg-extension which depends on surface orientation. Together, these combinations of behaviors enable flies to land in a versatile manner on substrates of various orientations."
https://openalex.org/W2967854067,"The Gran Chaco is a wide ecologic-geographic region comprising northern Argentina, western Paraguay, southern Bolivia and the southwestern extreme of Brazil. This region exhibits extreme temperatures, annually regular frosts, and sedimentary soils; it has been dramatically threatened by agriculture expansion in recent decades. Therefore, increasing knowledge of plant diversity is critical for conservation purposes. We present a Legume checklist of the Gran Chaco ecoregion including conservation status of its endemic species. Leguminosae is the third most diverse plant family in the Neotropics. Assuming a rigorous spatial definition of the Gran Chaco, we recorded 98 genera, 362 species, and 404 specific and infraspecific taxa. Endemic/typical taxa were 17%, comparable to adjacent tropical plant formations, and they were found in higher percentages in Caesalpinioideae (24%) and Cercidoideae (33%) than Papilionoideae (11%) subfamily. We also analyzed the plant diversity comparing lineages and subregions. The Gran Chaco Legumes are predominantly widespread generalists, or they belong to either Chaco sensu stricto or Neotropical Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest (SDTF) lineages. Though the Humid Chaco registered the highest species richness, Dry Chaco and Sierra Chaco, the most threatrened subregions, exhibited the highest percentages of exclusive and proper Chaco-lineage species. These results suggest that diversification of Legumes has been most relevant in Dry Chaco and Sierra Chaco, probably by their more demanding and harsh environmental conditions limiting the dispersion of generalists or intrusive-invading species. This study is paramount to reach an improved delimitation of the Gran Chaco ecoregion in transitional areas with the SDTF and Cerrado formations. Conservation status is critical in genera of high economic interest, such as Arachis, Mimosa and Prosopis. At least one third of endemic taxa exhibit a critical status of conservation or are endangered, many of them being relevant to inbreeding program or exhibiting multiple economic uses."

We then calibrated the climate suitability patterns against the results of an expert elicitation of disease pressure patterns. We found a moderately strong non-linear relationship between modelled climate suitability for P.°fijiensis and the expert ratings for disease pressure. The strength of the relationship provides a cross-validation between the CLIMEX model and the expert elicitation process. The bulk of global banana production experiences high potential threat from P. fijiensis, and the higher yielding areas for banana and plantain production are at greatest threat. By explicitly considering the role of irrigation we have been able to identify how strategic irrigation could be used to support banana production in areas that are at low risk from P. fijiensis."
https://openalex.org/W2966895836,"CD59 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored cell surface inhibitor of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC). We showed previously that CD59 is highly expressed in pancreatic islets but is down-regulated in rodent models of diabetes. CD59 knockdown but not enzymatic removal of cell surface CD59 led to a loss of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), suggesting that an intracellular pool of CD59 is required. In this current paper, we now report that non-GPI-anchored CD59 is present in the cytoplasm, colocalizes with exocytotic protein vesicle-associated membrane protein 2, and completely rescues GSIS in cells lacking endogenous CD59 expression. The involvement of cytosolic non-GPI-anchored CD59 in GSIS is supported in phosphatidylinositol glycan class A knockout GPI anchor-deficient β-cells, in which GSIS is still CD59 dependent. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated different structural requirements of CD59 for its 2 functions, MAC inhibition and GSIS. Our results suggest that CD59 is retrotranslocated from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cytosol, a process mediated by recognition of trimmed N-linked oligosaccharides, supported by the partial glycosylation of non-GPI-anchored cytosolic CD59 as well as the failure of N-linked glycosylation site mutant CD59 to reach the cytosol or rescue GSIS. This study thus proposes the previously undescribed existence of non-GPI-anchored cytosolic CD59, which is required for insulin secretion.-Golec, E., Rosberg, R., Zhang, E., Renström, E., Blom, A.

Patient visits between 2009 and 2015 were included for patients who were at least 18 years old, had a documented prescription for a non-insulin antidiabetic medication, and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Sample survey data were extrapolated to national estimates using data weights. Prescribing rates were calculated as the number of visits with a documented medication class divided by the total number of visits with a prescription for any diabetes medication class, times 100%. Results A total of 303 million patient visits were included in this study. The median (IQR) patient age was 64 (55–73) years old and 49.8% were male. Sulfonylurea prescribing rates decreased from 43% in 2009 to 36.5% in 2015. Prescribing of GLP-1 receptor agonists increased from 2009 to 2014 (3.95% to 5.30%), but then decreased to 4.19% in 2015. SGLT-2 inhibitor prescribing began in 2013 and increased to 7.3% by 2015. Metformin prescribing remained relatively stable over the study period (range 70% to 72%). Conclusions National ambulatory sulfonylurea prescribing decreased from 2009 to 2015 with a corresponding increase in newer non-insulin antidiabetic agent prescribing."
https://openalex.org/W2967183676,"External auditory exostoses (EAE) have been noted among the Neandertals and a few other Pleistocene humans, but until recently they have been discussed primary as minor pathological lesions with possible auditory consequences. An assessment of available western Eurasian late Middle and Late Pleistocene human temporal bones with sufficiently preserved auditory canals (n = 77) provides modest levels of EAE among late Middle Pleistocene archaic humans (≈20%) and early modern humans (Middle Paleolithic: ≈25%; Early/Mid Upper Paleolithic: 20.8%; Late Upper Paleolithic: 9.5%). The Neandertals, however, exhibit an exceptionally high level of EAE (56.5%; 47.8% if two anomalous cases are considered normal). The levels of EAE for the early modern humans are well within recent human ranges of variation, frequencies which are low for equatorial inland and high latitude samples but occasionally higher elsewhere. The Early/Mid Upper Paleolithic frequency is nonetheless high for a high latitude sample under interpleniglacial conditions. Given the strong etiological and environmental associations of EAE development with exposure to cold water and/or damp wind chill, the high frequency of EAE among the Neandertals implies frequent aquatic resource exploitation, more frequent than the archeological and stable isotopic evidence for Middle Paleolithic/Neandertal littoral and freshwater resource foraging implies. As such, the Neandertal data parallel a similar pattern evident in eastern Eurasian archaic humans. Yet, factors in addition to cold water/wind exposure may well have contributed to their high EAE frequencies."

We aimed to clarify whether perioperative exercise capacity was related to long-term survival in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with chronic liver injury undergoing hepatectomy. One hundred-six patients with hepatocellular carcinoma underwent pre- and postoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing to determine their anaerobic threshold, defined as the point between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption per unit of time. Testing involved 35 items including blood biochemistry analysis, in-vivo component analysis, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. We classified patients with anaerobic threshold ≥ 90% 6 months postoperatively compared with the preoperative level as the maintenance group (n = 78) and patients with anaerobic threshold < 90% as the decrease group (n = 28). Five-year recurrence-free survival rates were 39.9% vs. 9.9% (maintenance vs. decrease group) (hazard ratio: 1.87 [95% confidence interval: 1.12-3.13]; P = 0.018). Five-year overall survival rates were maintenance: 81.9%, and decrease: 61.7% (hazard ratio: 2.95 [95% confidence interval: 1.37-6.33]; P = 0.006). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models showed that perioperative maintenance of anaerobic threshold was an independent prognostic indicator for both recurrence-free- and overall survival. Although the mean anaerobic threshold from preoperative to postoperative month 6 decreased in the exercise-not-implemented group, the exercise-implemented group experienced increased anaerobic threshold, on average, at postoperative month 6. The significant prognostic factor affecting postoperative survival for chronic liver injury patients with HCC undergoing hepatectomy was maintenance of anaerobic threshold up to 6 months postoperatively."

Growing evidence suggest its involvement of autoimmune and genetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of MMD. This study aims to clarify the association between HLA allele and MMD.Case-control study: the DNA of 136 MMD patients in Japan was extracted and the genotype of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) from this DNA was determined by super-high-resolution single-molecule sequence-based typing using next-generation sequencing. Next, the frequency of each HLA allele (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DPB1) was compared with those in the Japanese control database. In addition, haplotype estimation was performed using the expectation maximization algorithm.The frequencies of the HLA-DRB1*04:10 allele (4.77% vs. 1.47% in the control group; P = 1.7 × 10-3; odds ratio [OR] = 3.35) and of the HLA-DRB1*04:10-HLA-DQB1*04:02 haplotype (haplotype frequency 4.41% vs. 1.35% in the control group; P = 2.0 × 10-3; OR = 3.37) significantly increased. The frequency of thyroid diseases, such as Graves' disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis, increased in HLA-DRB1*04:10-positive MMD patients compared with that in HLA-DRB1*04:10-negative MMD patients.HLA-DRB1*04:10 is a risk allele and HLA-DRB1*04:10-HLA-DQB1*04:02 a risk haplotype for MMD. In addition, HLA-DRB1*04:10 is associated with thyroid disease in MMD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2969004747,"Schooling fishes, like flocking birds and swarming insects, display remarkable behavioral coordination. While over 25% of fish species exhibit schooling behavior, nighttime schooling has rarely been observed or reported. This is due to vision being the primary modality for schooling, which is corroborated by the fact that most fish schools disperse at critically low light levels. Here we report on a large aggregation of the bioluminescent flashlight fish Anomalops katoptron that exhibited nighttime schooling behavior during multiple moon phases, including the new moon. Data were recorded with a suite of low-light imaging devices, including a high-speed, high-resolution scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) camera. Image analysis revealed nighttime schooling using synchronized bioluminescent flashing displays, and demonstrated that school motion synchrony exhibits correlation with relative swim speed. A computer model of flashlight fish schooling behavior shows that only a small percentage of individuals need to exhibit bioluminescence in order for school cohesion to be maintained. Flashlight fish schooling is unique among fishes, in that bioluminescence enables schooling in conditions of no ambient light. In addition, some members can still partake in the school while not actively exhibiting their bioluminescence. Image analysis of our field data and model demonstrate that if a small percentage of fish become motivated to change direction, the rest of the school follows. The use of bioluminescence by flashlight fish to enable schooling in shallow water adds an additional ecological application to bioluminescence and suggests that schooling behavior in mesopelagic bioluminescent fishes may be also mediated by luminescent displays."
https://openalex.org/W2969194301,"Incubating birds must trade-off leaving the nest to forage with staying on the nest to maintain optimal temperatures for developing embryos. This trade-off is expressed through incubation behavior, which can be heavily influenced by climate, food availability, attentiveness of their mates, and nest predation risk. Comparative studies across species have shown that incubation behavior varies across latitude, but few studies have explored how incubation behavior varies across sites within species. We might expect incubation behavior to be flexible and respond to local environmental challenges; alternatively, behavior may be relatively fixed and vary little across a species’ range. We explored four incubation behaviors (male feeding rate, female off-bout duration, female off-bout frequency, and the proportion of time incubating females spent on the nest) in a widespread songbird, the yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), breeding at a temperate and subarctic site. As temperatures warmed at both sites, males fed females less often, and as male feeding rates decreased, off-bout durations and frequencies increased causing the proportion of time on the nest to decrease. While incubation behaviors changed in similar ways between sites, off-bout durations shortened with increasing male feeding rates most strongly at the temperate site. Overall, these results show flexibility in incubation behaviors in response to different environmental cues, which likely minimize costs associated with provisioning incubating parents and maintaining warm nest temperatures, and suggests that male feeding may be especially important for breeding in cold regions."
https://openalex.org/W2967292822,"The pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii, is a major pest on Capsicum species. Apart from natural spread, there is a risk of spread via international pepper trade. In the Netherlands, a pepper weevil outbreak occurred in 2012 and affected six greenhouses producing different sweet pepper varieties. The following year, a pepper weevil outbreak occurred in Italy. To trace the origin of the Dutch outbreak and to establish if the Dutch and Italian outbreaks were linked, we determined the mitogenomes of A. eugenii specimens collected at outbreak locations, and compared these with specimens from the native area, and other areas where the pest was introduced either by natural dispersal or via trade. The circular 17,257 bp A. eugenii mitogenome comprises thirteen mitochondrial genes typically found in insect species. Intra-species variation of these mitochondrial genes revealed four main mitochondrial lineages encompassing 41 haplotypes. The highest diversity was observed for specimens from its presumed native area (i.e. Mexico). The Dutch outbreak specimens represented three highly similar haplotypes, suggesting a single introduction of the pest. The major Dutch haplotype was also found in two specimens from New Jersey. As the Netherlands does not have pepper trade with New Jersey, it is likely that the specimens sampled in New Jersey and those sampled in the Netherlands originate from a shared source that was not included in this study. In addition, our analysis shows that the Italian and Dutch outbreaks were not linked. The mitochondrial genome is a useful tool to trace outbreak populations and the methodology presented in this paper could prove valuable for other invasive pest species, such as the African fruit moth Thaumatotibia leucotreta and emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis."
https://openalex.org/W2968934335,"Resuscitation with 0.9% Normal Saline (NS), a non-buffered acidic solution, leads to increased morbidity and mortality in the critically ill. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms of endothelial injury after exposure to NS. The hypothesis of this investigation is that exposure of endothelium to NS would lead to loss of cell membrane integrity, resulting in release of ATP, activation of the purinergic receptor (P2X7R), and subsequent activation of stress activated signaling pathways and inflammation. Human saphenous vein endothelial cells (HSVEC) incubated in NS, but not buffered electrolyte solution (Plasma-Lyte, PL), exhibited abnormal morphology and increased release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and decreased transendothelial resistance (TEER), suggesting loss of membrane integrity. Incubation of intact rat aorta (RA) or human saphenous vein in NS but not PL led to impaired endothelial-dependent relaxation which was ameliorated by apyrase (hydrolyzes ATP) or SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor). Exposure of HSVEC to NS but not PL led to activation of p38 MAPK and its downstream substrate, MAPKAP kinase 2 (MK2). Treatment of HSVEC with exogenous ATP led to interleukin 1β (IL-1β) release and increased vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) expression. Treatment of RA with IL-1β led to impaired endothelial relaxation. IL-1β treatment of HSVEC led to increases in p38 MAPK and MK2 phosphorylation, and increased levels of arginase II. Incubation of porcine saphenous vein (PSV) in PL with pH adjusted to 6.0 or less also led to impaired endothelial function, suggesting that the acidic nature of NS is what contributes to endothelial dysfunction. Volume overload resuscitation in a porcine model after hemorrhage with NS, but not PL, led to acidosis and impaired endothelial function. These data suggest that endothelial dysfunction caused by exposure to acidic, non-buffered NS is associated with loss of membrane integrity, release of ATP, and is modulated by P2X7R-mediated inflammatory responses."

Here, using the lepidopteran insect and agricultural pest cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) as a model and immunoblotting, RT-qPCR, RNA interference (RNAi), and ChIP assays, we found that the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) up-regulates STIM1 expression via G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and the 20E nuclear receptor (EcRB1).

The steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone upregulates calcium release-activated calcium channel modulator 1 expression to induce apoptosis in the midgut of Helicoverpa armigera.Cell Calcium. 2017; 68: 24-3310.1016/j.ceca.2017.10.004Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); however, currently available data are insufficient to determine the mechanism of steroid hormone-induced Ca2+ entry, without understanding the role of the key initiator STIM1 in the process. The 20E is also produced by various plants, such as Cyanotis vaga, to disrupt development of insect pests (33Thummel C.S. Chory J. Steroid signaling in plants and insects: common themes, different pathways.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (12502734): 3113-312910.1101/gad.1042102Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), however, the mechanism is unclear. To address these questions, the present study focused on STIM1 using the agricultural pest, cotton bollworm (Lepidoptera H. armigera), as a model. We revealed that 20E, via GPCRs and EcRB1, up-regulated STIM1 expression. 20E, via GPCR, PLC, IP3R, and PKC signaling, induced the phosphorylation of STIM1 at Ser-485, which was essential for aggregation of STIM1 and calcium influx leading to apoptosis. STIM1 is essential for the degradation of the larval midgut and 20E-regulated gene expression. Our study proved that 20E induces SOCE via a GPCR-mediated nongenomic pathway to induce insect metamorphosis. We prepared rabbit-derived polyclonal antibodies against the STIM1 and examined their specificity by Western blotting. We found that the antiserum had the ability to recognize a 65-kDa molecular weight (Mr) protein specifically, which was consistent with the predicted Mr of STIM1. However, the pre-serum of rabbit did not recognize any protein (Fig. 1A), which suggests that the antibodies had specificity to STIM1 of H. armigera. The expression profiles of STIM1 in certain tissues from fifth instar larvae to the pupal stage were detected using Western blotting to verify the involvement of STIM1 in larval development and metamorphosis. STIM1 was detected in the epidermis, midgut, and fat body, with a marked increase in its level at the metamorphic stage from sixth instar larvae to the late pupae (Fig. 1B). The data were quantified based on three independent experiments (Fig. 1C). The Mr of STIM1 was decreased by treatment with λPPase, suggesting that STIM1 was phosphorylated posttranslationally (Fig. 1D). These data suggested that STIM1 plays an important role in insect metamorphosis. The increased expression level of STIM1 suggested that 20E might up-regulate STIM1 expression, because the 20E titer increases during metamorphosis in lepidopteran insects (34Riddiford L.M. Hiruma K. Zhou X. Nelson C.A. Insights into the molecular basis of the hormonal control of molting and metamorphosis from Manduca sexta and Drosophila melanogaster.Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 1327-133810.1016/j.ibmb.2003.06.001Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). To verify the up-regulation of STIM1 by 20E, we examined the level of STIM1 in the midgut using Western blotting after 20E injection into larvae. The results showed that the level of STIM1 was increased by 20E injection in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2, A and B). Quantitative analysis confirmed that the expression of STIM1 was increased by 20E induction significantly (Fig. 2, C and D). The results demonstrated that 20E increased the expression level of STIM1 in the midgut. GPCRs, such as ErGPCR-1 (26Cai M.J. Dong D.J. Wang Y. Liu P.C. Liu W. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. G-protein–coupled receptor participates in 20-hydroxyecdysone signaling on the plasma membrane.Cell Commun.

Therefore, we knocked down the expression of ErGPCR-1, ErGPCR-2, EcRB1, and USP1, respectively, in HaEpi cells and detected STIM1 expression to address the signaling axis of 20E up-regulated STIM1 expression. The qRT-PCR results showed that the 20E-promoted expression of STIM1 was repressed after knockdown of ErGPCR-1, ErGPCR-2, EcRB1, and USP1 (Fig. 3, A–D). The interference efficiencies were detected after transfection of dsRNA alone (Fig. 3E). The results suggested that 20E, via the ErGPCR-1 and ErGPCR-2 cell membrane GPCRs and EcRB1/USP1 nuclear receptor transcription complex signaling axis, up-regulates STIM1 expression. To confirm the above hypothesis, the EcR-binding element (EcRE) was analyzed and an EcRE was predicted in the 5′-upstream genomic DNA sequence of STIM1 in the genome of H. armigera using the JASPAR website (http://jaspar.genereg.net/) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

We identified an EcRE in the promoter region of STIM1, 5′-GCGGTTAATGCATTA-3′, which is very similar to the previously identified EcRE, 5′-GGGGTCAATGAACTG-3′, in the promoter region of HR3 (28Liu W. Cai M.J. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. In a nongenomic action, steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone induces phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase 10 to promote gene transcription.Endocrinology. 2014; 155 (24517229): 1738-175010.1210/en.2013-2020Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with a few base differences (Fig. 3F). ChIP experimental analysis proved that EcRB1 could bind to the EcRE in the promoter region of STIM1 (Fig. 3G). These results showed that the different base had no effect on the binding of EcRB1 and EcRE. These data indicated that 20E directly promotes STIM1 transcription by EcRB1 binding to the EcRE. To identify the function of STIM1 in the larval midgut, we first examined the localization of STIM1 in the midgut. STIM1 was subjected to immunohistochemistry using polyclonal antibodies. We found that little STIM1 distributed in the midgut of sixth instar larvae at 24 h. In contrast, abundant STIM1 was detected in the midgut of the sixth instar larvae at 48 and 96 h. In addition, STIM1 was mainly located in the larval midgut, with little STIM1 signal in the imaginal midgut during metamorphosis (Fig. 4). These results suggested that STIM1 is expressed in the larval midgut, and might be related to midgut apoptosis during metamorphosis. STIM1 was knocked down by injecting dsSTIM1 into fifth and sixth instar larvae to explore the function of STIM1 during insect metamorphosis. Compared with that in the dsGFP injection control group, pupation was delayed by about 30 h in the dsSTIM1 injection group (Fig. 5, A and B). The efficiency of RNAi of STIM1 was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 5C). In H. amigera, the midgut turns red at 72 h of the sixth instar larvae when it occurs apoptosis during metamorphosis (36Wang J.L. Jiang X.J. Wang Q. Hou L.J. Xu D.W. Wang J.X. Zhao X.F. Identification and expression profile of a putative basement membrane protein gene in the midgut of Helicoverpa armigera.BMC Dev.

However, the midgut did not turn red after injection of dsSTIM1 for 96 h and the larval midgut did not separate from imaginal midgut, compared with the larvae injected with the control dsGFP injection (Fig. 5, D and E). qRT-PCR analysis showed that the expression of 20E-response genes, HR3, EcRB1, USP1, and BrZ7, and apoptosis-related genes, Caspase-3 and Caspase-6, were repressed in the midgut after interference by dsSTIM1 in the larval midgut (Fig. 5F). Similar results were observed in HaEpi cells after knockdown of STIM1 (Fig. 5G). These results demonstrated that STIM1 participates in the larval midgut PCD and metamorphosis. To address the mechanism of STIM1's participation in 20E-promoted gene expression and metamorphosis, the intracellular Ca2+ levels were examined after STIM1 was knocked down in HaEpi cells. 20E promoted the release of intracellular-stored Ca2+ ions and thus caused Ca2+ influx (Fig. 6A). However, the release of intracellular Ca2+ was unaffected, but the influx of extracellular Ca2+ was repressed (Fig. 6B) when STIM1 was knocked down. Besides, 20E-induced apoptosis was also detected using a TUNEL assay after knockdown of STIM1. 5 μm 20E-induced apoptosis in 72 h in the blank control and dsGFP control. However, the apoptosis was repressed after knockdown of STIM1 (Fig. 6C). The statistical analysis of the ratio of apoptotic cells showed similar results (Fig. 6D). The efficacy of STIM1 knockdown by RNAi was confirmed using qRT-PCR (Fig. 6E). These data suggested that STIM1 participates in 20E-promoted SOCE, which is necessary for 20E pathway gene expression and apoptosis. To demonstrate the mechanism of STIM1's function in 20E-promoted SOCE, we examined the subcellular localization of STIM1 under regulation by 20E using overexpression of STIM1-GFP in HaEpi cells. Thapsigargin (Tg), as an agonist of SOC, triggers stored calcium release, but inhibits the calcium pump sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) on the ER will suppress calcium back into the ER from the cytosol (38Muramatsu Y. Maemoto T. Iwashita A. Matsuoka N.

Pharmacol. 2007; 563 (17343843): 40-4810.1016/j.ejphar.2007.01.060Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used Tg as a positive control of calcium-store depletion. By staining the cell membrane with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), we found that 20E promoted STIM1-GFP to form oligomers and move toward the PM, where they were located below the PM. The aggregation of STIM1-GFP disappeared after the addition of calcium into DPBS followed by 20E treatment that refilled the intracellular calcium store. Tg promoted similar aggregation and subcellular translocation of STIM1-GFP to 20E; however, the addition of calcium did not eliminate the Tg-induced aggregation of STIM1-GFP because Tg blocked the refill of the calcium store (Fig. 7A). The percentage of STIM1-aggregated cells were calculated and suggested the same results (Fig. 7B). The overexpressed STIM1-GFP and GFP tag proteins were detected by Western blotting (Fig. 7C). These"

Here, single cell RNA-seq was utilized to study the transcriptomic profile of early zebrafish PGCs (primordial germ cells) at three different developmental stages. The three stages were 6, 11 and 24 hpf (hours post fertilization). For each developmental stage, three zebrafish PGCs from one embryo were collected, and 9 samples in total were used in this experiment. Single cell RNA-seq results showed that 5099–7376 genes were detected among the 9 samples, and the number of expressed genes decreased as development progressed. Based on the gene expression pattern, samples from 6 and 11 hpf clustered closely, while samples from 24 hpf were more dispersed. By WGCNA (weighted gene co-expression network analysis), the two biggest modules that had inverse gene expression patterns were found to be related to PGC formation or migration. Functional enrichment analysis for these two modules showed that PGCs mainly conducted migration and cell division in early development (6/11 hpf) and translation activity became active in late development (24 hpf). Differentially expressed gene analyses showed that more genes were downregulated than upregulated between two adjacent stages, and genes related to PGC formation or migration reported by previous studies decreased significantly from 11 to 24 hpf. Our results provide base knowledge about zebrafish PGC development at the single cell level and can be further studied by other researchers interested in biological development."

Being confronted with an incurable cancer diagnosis can be highly disruptive for the patient's partner and can be considered a potentially traumatic event. However, most caregivers seem to adapt well during the process of providing care. This finding is in line with the concept of resilience in literature: a dynamic process of adapting well, resulting from the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic resources and risks. Resilience is age-related, with the elderly population being higher in resilience as compared to the younger generation. However, resilience has been understudied in middle-aged caregivers.To explore what intrinsic and extrinsic resources facilitate or hamper resilience in the middle-aged partner of a patient with incurable cancer.Nine middle-aged partners of patients who died at home of cancer were selected and interviewed in depth within the first year following the death of their partner. A thematic analysis utilizing an inductive approach was conducted.Resilience was challenged by the partner's diagnosis of incurable cancer. All participants made use of a set of interacting, caregiver-specific and context-related resources, facilitating a resilient process and leading to positive feelings and even personal growth. The partners demonstrated individual competences: adaptive flexibility, positivism, a sense of self-initiative and adaptive dependency. Furthermore, they relied on their context: cancer-related professionals and relatives. Context and situation interact continuously. The resulting dynamics were based on the context-availability, meaningful relationships and the patient's role.A resilient trajectory results from an interplay between individual and contextual resources. To build resilience in middle-aged partners of patients with incurable cancer, health care professionals should address all available resources. Moreover, they should be aware of being part of the caregiver's context, a complex adaptive system that can be either resilience-supporting or -threatening."
https://openalex.org/W2967477613,"Player evaluation plays a fundamental role in the decision-making processes of professional sporting organisations. In the Australian Football League, both subjective and objective evaluations of player match performance are commonplace. This study aimed to identify the extent to which performance indicators can explain subjective ratings of player performance. A secondary aim was to compare subjective and objective ratings of player performance. Inside Football Player Ratings (IFPR) and Australian Football League Player Ratings were collected as subjective and objective evaluations of player performance, respectively, for each player during all 1026 matches throughout the 2013-2017 Australian Football League seasons. Nine common player performance indicators, player role classification, player age and match outcomes were also collected. Standardised linear mixed model and recursive partitioning and regression tree models were undertaken across the whole dataset, as well as separately for each of the seven player roles. The mixed model analysis produced a model associating the performance indicators with IFPR at a root mean square error of 0.98. Random effects accounting for differences between seasons and players ranged by 0.09 and 1.73 IFPR each across the five seasons and 1052 players, respectively. The recursive partitioning and regression tree model explained IFPR exactly in 35.8% of instances, and to within 1.0 IFPR point in 81.0% of instances. When analysed separately by player role, exact explanation varied from 25.2% to 41.7%, and within 1.0 IFPR point from 70.3% to 88.6%. Overall, kicks and handballs were most associated with the IFPR. This study highlights that a select few features account for a majority of the variance when explaining subjective ratings of player performance, and that these vary by player role. Australian Football League organisations should utilise both subjective and objective assessments of performance to gain a better understanding of the differences associated with subjective performance assessment."

An intra-tendinous morphological change was defined as collagen fiber disorganization detected by a low peak spatial frequency radius (PSFR) obtained from spatial frequency analysis (SFA) techniques in sonography. Ninety-one runners (53 males and 38 females; 37.9 ± 11.6 years) with 8.8 ± 7.3 years of running experience participated. Height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were recorded. Participants completed a survey about running and injury/pain history and the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment-Achilles (VISA-A) survey. Heel raise endurance and knee-to-wall composite dorsiflexion were assessed. Brightness-mode (B-mode) sonographic images were captured longitudinally and transversely on the Achilles tendon bilaterally. Sonographic images were analyzed for gross morphology (i.e., cross-sectional area [CSA]), neovascularization, and intra-tendinous morphology (i.e., PSFR) for each participant. The factors associated with altered intra-tendinous morphology of the Achilles tendon were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. Multivariate analyses revealed that male sex was significantly associated with a decreased PSFR. Additionally, male sex and the presence of current Achilles tendon pain were found to be significantly related to decreased PSFR using a univariate analysis. Our findings suggested that male sex and presence of current Achilles tendon pain were related to intra-tendinous morphological alterations in the Achilles tendon of runners."
https://openalex.org/W2967988317,"When individuals are undecided between options, they may flip a coin or use other aids that produce random outcomes to support decision-making. Such aids lead to clear suggestions, which, interestingly, individuals do not necessarily follow. Instead when looking at the outcome, individuals sometimes appear to like or dislike the suggestion, and then decide according to this feeling. In this manuscript we argue that such a decision aid can function as a catalyst. As it points to one option over the other, individuals focus on obtaining this option and engage in a more vivid representation of the same. By imagining obtaining the option, feelings related to the option become stronger, which then drive feelings of satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the outcome of the decision aid. We provide support for this phenomenon throughout two studies. Study 1 indicates that using a catalyst leads to stronger feelings. Study 2 replicates this finding using a different catalyst, and rules out alternative explanations. Here, participants report that after having used a catalyst, they experienced a stronger feeling of suddenly knowing what they want compared to the control group that did not use a catalyst. Implications of these results for research and practice are discussed."

MSG-treated mice were examined behaviourally and histologically in relation to some features of AD. Four-week old mice received 5 subcutaneous MSG (2 g/kg) injections on alternate days, or saline. At age 10–12 weeks, they were given a battery of behavioural tests for species-typical behaviours and working memory. The mice were killed at 12 weeks and the brains excised. Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein was assessed in cortical and hippocampal neurons by immunohistochemistry, and in cerebral cortical homogenates. A 78% increase in cortical concentrations of phosphorylated tau protein was observed in the MSG mice. Intracellular hyperphosphorylated tau immunostaining was observed diffusely in the cortex and hippocampus, together with cortical atrophic neurons, extensive vacuolation and dysmorphic neuropil suggestive of spongiform neurodegeneration. Nest-building was significantly impaired, and spontaneous T-maze alternation was reduced, suggesting defective short-term working memory. Subcutaneous MSG treatment also induced a 56% reduction in exploratory head dips in a holeboard (P = 0.009), and a non-significant tendency for decreased burrowing behaviour (P = 0.085). These effects occurred in the absence of MSG-induced obesity or gross locomotor deficits. The findings point to subcutaneous MSG administration in early life as a cause of tau pathology and compromised species-typical behaviour in rodents. Determining whether MSG can be useful in modelling AD requires further studies of longer duration and full behavioural characterization."

However, knowledge regarding the role of FBXO31 during normal cell-cycle progression is restricted to its functions during the G2/M phase. Interestingly, FBXO31 levels remain high even during the early G1 phase, a crucial stage for preparing the cells for DNA replication.

Here, using flow cytometric, biochemical, and immunofluorescence techniques, we show that FBXO31 is essential for maintaining optimum expression of the cell-cycle protein cyclin A for efficient cell-cycle progression. Stable FBXO31 knockdown led to atypical accumulation of cyclin A during the G1 phase, driving premature DNA replication and compromised loading of the minichromosome maintenance complex, resulting in replication from fewer origins and DNA double-strand breaks. Because of these inherent defects in replication, FBXO31-knockdown cells were hypersensitive to replication stress-inducing agents and displayed pronounced genomic instability.

The earliest and strongest aphid-triggered alterations in the levels of TT, PT and GSH, and the greatest induction of GST activity, were recorded in the resistant Płomyk seedlings in relation to the relatively resistant Ambrozja and the susceptible Złota Karłowa."
https://openalex.org/W2968740417,"Mammalian ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily F member 3 (ABCF3) is a class 2 ABC protein that has previously been identified as a partner of the mouse flavivirus resistance protein 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase 1B (OAS1B). The functions and natural substrates of ABCF3 are not known. In this study, analysis of purified ABCF3 showed that it is an active ATPase, and binding analyses with a fluorescent ATP analog suggested unequal contributions by the two nucleotide-binding domains. We further showed that ABCF3 activity is increased by lipids, including sphingosine, sphingomyelin, platelet-activating factor, and lysophosphatidylcholine. However, cholesterol inhibited ABCF3 activity, whereas alkyl ether lipids either inhibited or resulted in a biphasic response, suggesting small changes in lipid structure differentially affect ABCF3 activity. Point mutations in the two nucleotide-binding domains of ABCF3 affected sphingosine-stimulated ATPase activity differently, further supporting different roles for the two catalytic pockets. We propose a model in which pocket 1 is the site of basal catalysis, whereas pocket 2 engages in ligand-stimulated ATP hydrolysis. Co-localization of the ABCF3–OAS1B complex to the virus-remodeled endoplasmic reticulum membrane has been shown before. We also noted that co-expression of ABCF3 and OAS1B in bacteria alleviated growth inhibition caused by expression of OAS1B alone, and ABCF3 significantly enhanced OAS1B levels, indirectly showing interaction between these two proteins in bacterial cells. As viral RNA synthesis requires large amounts of ATP, we conclude that lipid-stimulated ATP hydrolysis may contribute to the reduction in viral RNA production characteristic of the flavivirus resistance phenotype.

https://openalex.org/W2968459265,"We describe a new genome alignment-based model for understanding the diversity of viruses based on evolutionary genetic relationships. This approach uses information theory and a physical model to determine the information shared by the genes in two genomes. Pairwise comparisons of genes from the viruses are created from alignments using NCBI BLAST, and their match scores are combined to produce a metric between genomes, which is in turn used to determine a global classification using the 5,817 viruses on RefSeq. In cases where there is no measurable alignment between any genes, the method falls back to a coarser measure of genome relationship: the mutual information of 4-mer frequency. This results in a principled model which depends only on the genome sequence, which captures many interesting relationships between viral families, and which creates clusters which correlate well with both the Baltimore and ICTV classifications. The incremental computational cost of classifying a novel virus is low and therefore newly discovered viruses can be quickly identified and classified. The model goes beyond alignment-free classifications by producing a full phylogeny similar to those constructed by virologists using qualitative features, while relying only on objective genes. These results bolster the case for mathematical models in microbiology which can characterize organisms using only their genetic material and provide an independent check for phylogenies constructed by humans, considerably faster and more cheaply than less modern approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2968774324,"Tumor cell migration depends on the interactions of adhesion proteins with the extracellular matrix. Lutheran/basal cell adhesion molecule (Lu/BCAM) promotes tumor cell migration by binding to laminin α5 chain, a subunit of laminins 511 and 521. Lu/BCAM is a type I transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain of 59 (Lu) or 19 (Lu(v13)) amino acids. Here, using an array of techniques, including site-directed mutagenesis, immunoblotting, FRET, and proximity-ligation assays, we show that both Lu and Lu(v13) form homodimers at the cell surface of epithelial cancer cells. We mapped two small-XXX-small motifs in the transmembrane domain as potential sites for monomers docking and identified three cysteines in the cytoplasmic domain as being critical for covalently stabilizing dimers. We further found that Lu dimerization and phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain were concomitantly needed to promote cell migration. We conclude that Lu is the critical isoform supporting tumor cell migration on laminin 521 and that the Lu:Lu(v13) ratio at the cell surface may control the balance between cellular firm adhesion and migration."

An online survey targeting married, heterosexual couples living in Sarasota County, Florida, USA was sent out between March and May, 2015. Both the husbands and the wives were asked to fill out the survey. A total of 170 surveys were used for analysis. Results suggested that husbands and wives felt that they had shared responsibility for most of the 19 preparedness behaviors considered. However, a few stereotypically masculine preparedness behaviors were found to typically fall to husbands. Husbands' and wives' views of perceived responsibility were not statistically different, but husbands tended to favor individual responsibility, while wives tended to favor joint responsibility. Higher levels of agreement were significantly associated with greater engagement in planning-related preparedness behaviors. Policy implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2967566799,"Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) remains as an accurate approach for gene expression analysis but requires labor-intensive validation of reference genes using species-specific primers. To ease such demand, the aim was to design and test a multi-species primer set to validate reference genes for inter-genus RT-qPCR gene expression analysis. Primers were designed for ten housekeeping genes using transcript sequences of various livestock species. All ten gene transcripts were detected by RT-PCR in Bos taurus (cattle), Bubalus bubalis (buffaloes), Capra hircus (goats), and Ovis aries (sheep) cDNA. Primer efficiency was attained for eight reference genes using B. taurus-O. aries fibroblast cDNA (95.54-98.39%). The RT-qPCR data normalization was carried out for B. taurus vs. O. aries relative gene expression using Bestkeeper, GeNorm, Norm-finder, Delta CT method, and RefFinder algorithms. Validation of inter-genus RT-qPCR showed up-regulation of TLR4 and ZFX gene transcripts in B. taurus fibroblasts, irrespectively of normalization conditions (two, three, or four reference genes). In silico search in mammalian transcriptomes showed that the multi-species primer set is expected to amplify transcripts of at least two distinct loci in 114 species, and 79 species would be covered by six or more primers. Hence, a multi-species primer set allows for inter-genus gene expression analysis between O. aries and B. taurus fibroblasts and further reveals species-specific gene transcript abundance of key transcription factors."
https://openalex.org/W2967703944,"Human fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) domain containing protein 1 (FAHD1) is a mitochondrial oxalocatate decarboxylase, the first of its kind identified in eukaryotes. The physiological role of FAHD1 in other eukaryotes is still poorly understood. In C. elegans loss of the FAHD1 ortholog FAHD-1 was reported to impair mitochondrial function, locomotion and egg-laying behavior, yet the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Using tissue-specific rescue of fahd-1(-) worms, we find that these phenotypic abnormalities are at least in part due to fahd-1’s function in neurons. Moreover, we show that egg-laying defects in fahd-1(-) worms can be fully rescued by external dopamine administration and that depletion of fahd-1 expression induces expression of several enzymes involved in serotonin biosynthesis. Together, our results support a role for fahd-1 in modulating serotonin levels and suggest this protein as a novel link between metabolism and neurotransmitter signaling in the nervous system. Finally, we propose a model to explain how a metabolic defect could ultimately lead to marked changes in neuronal signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2967958911,"Asparaginase is an amino acid–depleting agent used to treat blood cancers. Metabolic complications due to asparaginase affect liver function in humans. To examine how the liver response to asparaginase changes during maturity to adulthood, here we treated juvenile (2-week), young adult (8-week), and mature adult (16-week) mice with drug or excipient for 1 week and conducted RNA-Seq and functional analyses. Asparaginase reduced body growth and liver mass in juveniles but not in the adult animals. Unbiased exploration of the effect of asparaginase on the liver transcriptome revealed that the integrated stress response (ISR) was the only molecular signature shared across the ages, corroborating similar eukaryotic initiation factor 2 phosphorylation responses to asparaginase at all ages. Juvenile livers exhibited steatosis and iron accumulation following asparaginase exposure along with a hepatic gene signature indicating that asparaginase uniquely affects lipid, cholesterol, and iron metabolism in juvenile mice. In contrast, asparaginase-treated adult mice displayed greater variability in liver function, which correlated with an acute-phase inflammatory response gene signature. Asparaginase-exposed adults also had a serine/glycine/one-carbon metabolism gene signature in liver that corresponded with reduced circulating glycine and serine levels. These results establish the ISR as a conserved response to asparaginase-mediated amino acid deprivation and provide new insights into the relationship between the liver transcriptome and hepatic function upon asparaginase exposure."

Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) data were obtained from 6 healthy volunteers and 12 Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) patients with consent obtained. 3D patient-specific CMR-based ventricle models with different zero-load diastole and systole geometries due to myocardium contraction and relaxation were constructed to qualify right ventricle (RV) diastole and systole stress and strain values at begin-filling, end-filling, begin-ejection, and end-ejection, respectively. Our new models (called 2G models) can provide end-diastole and end-systole stress/strain values which models with one zero-load geometries (called 1G models) could not provide. 2G mean end-ejection stress value from the 18 participants was 321.4% higher than that from 1G models (p = 0.0002). 2G mean strain values was 230% higher than that of 1G models (p = 0.0002). TOF group (TG) end-ejection mean stress value was 105.4% higher than that of healthy group (HG) (17.54±7.42kPa vs. 8.54±0.92kPa, p = 0.0245).

Here we report increased PKCδI activation via release of its catalytic domain concurrent with increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in adipocytes from obese individuals. Using a screening strategy of dual recognition of PKCδI isozymes and a caspase-3 binding site on the PKCδI hinge domain with Schrödinger software and molecular dynamics simulations, we identified NP627, an organic small-molecule inhibitor of PKCδI. Characterization of NP627 by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) revealed that PKCδI and NP627 interact with each other with high affinity and specificity, SPR kinetics revealed that NP627 disrupts caspase-3 binding to PKCδI, and in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that NP627 specifically inhibits PKCδI activity. The SPR results also indicated that NP627 affects macromolecular interactions between protein surfaces. Of note, release of the PKCδI catalytic fragment was sufficient to induce apoptosis and inflammation in adipocytes. NP627 treatment of adipocytes from obese individuals significantly inhibited PKCδI catalytic fragment release, decreased inflammation and apoptosis, and significantly improved mitochondrial metabolism.

The obesity epidemic continues to rise in populations worldwide. Obesity per se is not fatal; however, the metabolic consequences and sequalae of obesity promote life-threatening morbidities such as cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, gout, and osteoarthritis. Adipose tissue is an important endocrine regulator of energy homeostasis and glucose metabolism. Fat accumulation in omental and subcutaneous abdominal depots is central to obesity and its associated diseases. Adipose tissue maintains a balance between lipogenesis (energy preservation during the postprandial period) and lipolysis (energy expenditure) via hormones and signaling pathways. Obesity results in altered profiles of adipokines (hormone and cytokines) secreted by adipose tissue. Adipose-specific adipokines include leptin and adiponectin, whereas adipocytokines such as TNFα 3The abbreviations used are: TNFtumor necrosis factorASCadipose stem cellASOantisense oligomerBMIbody mass indexSVFstromal vascular fractionqPCRquantitative PCRPIPropidium iodideMDmolecular dynamicsPARPpoly ADP ribose polymeraseRMSDroot mean square deviationSPRsurface plasmon resonanceRUresponse unitMBPmyelin basic proteinTMBtetramethylbenzidine substrateOCRoxygen consumption rateIRBinstitutional review boardDAPI4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. and interleukins are secreted by adipose tissue. Adipose tissue responds to excess energy or nutrition deficiency by increasing or decreasing cell size and mass. This remodeling by adipose tissue is a dynamic process and restricts inflammation and promotes insulin sensitivity. Under conditions of excess energy leading to hypertrophy of adipose tissue, the associated macrophages acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Obesity is accompanied by a chronic low level of inflammation. Apoptosis is also markedly increased in adipose tissue from obese humans and in high-fat diet–induced obesity in rodent models (1Kurokawa J. Nagano H. Ohara O. Kubota N. Kadowaki T. Arai S.

We previously published antisense oligomers (ASOs, Ionis Pharmaceuticals) directed toward the splice sites for PKCδ that could selectively inhibit the specific splice variant (20Jiang K.

We showed that ASO71 decreased PKCδI, which resulted in a decrease in PARP cleavage (apoptosis marker). The antisense oligomer ASO71 (which decreases PKCδI) and the commercially available PRKCD siRNA (which decreases both PKCδI and PKCδVIII) are not suitable, as these approaches decrease the total PKCδI levels and cannot delineate the role of PKCδI kinase activity specifically in obesity. Moreover, PKCδI levels regulate the cell cycle and adipogenesis (6Fukumoto S. Nishizawa Y. Hosoi M. Koyama H. Yamakawa K. Ohno S. Morii H.

As described above, PKCδI is a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by cleavage at its hinge region, releasing its C-terminal catalytic fragment. This fragment, freed from inhibition by the regulatory domain, is sufficient for its function (7Brodie C. Blumberg P.M.

The cleavage and activation of PKCδI set up a positive feedback loop that impinges upon upstream components of the death effector pathway, thereby amplifying the caspase cascade and helping cells commit to apoptosis (30Denning M.F.

Hence, to specifically inhibit PKCδI-mediated pathways, we chose to inhibit the kinase activity rather than decreasing its levels. Here we identified a small molecule that would inhibit cleavage of PKCδI in adipocytes and thereby decrease its kinase activity. We investigated the binding affinity of this small molecule to PKCδI and its ability to inhibit binding of caspase-3 to PKCδI. Using this small molecule to inhibit PKCδI kinase activity, we investigated whether inflammation, apoptosis, and metabolic dysfunction associated with obesity could be reduced in human adipocytes. We determined the expression of PKCδI in human adipose tissues obtained from obese individuals. Omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue from six lean and six obese patients (IRB 20295; obese BMIs between 43 and 45 kg/m2; lean BMIs between 22 and 23 kg/m2; nondiabetic, nonsmokers, other criteria matched; designated as subcutaneous lean, subcutaneous obese, omental lean, and omental obese according to depot and lean/obese status) were evaluated for PKCδI levels, and our results showed increased PKCδI levels in both subcutaneous and omental depots of obese subjects (Fig. 1a). Adipose tissue was digested with collagenase and purified to obtain adipocytes (free from other cells and macrophages) in supernatant, whereas the pellet contained the SVF fraction from which ASCs were isolated. The omental adipocytes were further analyzed by Western blotting. Our results showed increased PKCδI expression and release of its C-terminal catalytic fragment in obese adipocytes. Obese adipocytes had increased cleavage of caspase-3 (increased apoptosis) and higher expression of the adipokine TNFα, indicating increased inflammation (Fig. 1b). Next, the omental ASCs were differentiated into mature adipocytes in vitro as described previously by our laboratory (5Carter G. Apostolatos A. Patel R. Mathur A. Cooper D. Murr M. Patel N.A. Dysregulated alternative splicing pattern of PKCδ during differentiation of human preadipocytes represents distinct differences between lean and obese adipocytes.ISRN Obes. 2013; 2013 (24533217): 161345PubMed Google Scholar). We measured PKCδI levels using SYBR Green qPCR, and our results showed that PKCδI was increased in obese human ASCs and adipocytes (Fig. 1c). Schrödinger PRIME software was used to perform homology modeling of PKCδI. 3D structures of PKCδ isoforms (39Steinberg S.F. Structural basis of protein kinase C isoform function.Physiol.

These structures were then minimized using the Schrödinger Protein Preparation Wizard and the OPLS 2005 forcefields. De novo protein predictions were also prepared and minimized using Protein Preparation Wizard I-TASSER (40Yang J. Yan R. Roy A. Xu D. Poisson J. Zhang Y.

Compounds contained in Chembridge Microformat were prepared for docking to PKCδI by Schrödinger LigPrep.

Results were tabulated using a spreadsheet, and compounds with low ΔG across the models created were selected for in vitro analysis. The leading hits were tested for their ability to inhibit release of the catalytic fragment of PKCδI by treating obese adipocytes with 10 nm compounds. The top candidate, N′∼1∼,N′∼5∼-bis[3-(1,3-dioxo-1,3-dihydro-2H-isoindol-2-yl)propanimidoyl] pentanedihydrazide (hereafter referred to as NP627), was selected (Fig. 2, a and b) as a small molecule inhibiting the release of the PKCδI C-terminal fragment. Compound 594 (Cpd594) and compound 118 (Cpd118) were from the same screening process. Cpd594 was used as a control in subsequent experiments, as it is essentially half of the symmetrical NP627 and did not block release of the C-terminal PKCδI fragment in adipocytes (as shown in Fig. 2, a and b). The structure of PKCδI obtained from homology modeling was optimized using the QwikMD plugin for Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) (42Ribeiro J.V. Bernardi R.C. Rudack T. Stone J.E. Phillips J.C. Freddolino P.L. Schulten K. QwikMD: integrative molecular dynamics toolkit for novices and experts.Sci. Rep. 2016; 6 (27216779): 2653610.1038/srep26536Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The PKCδ1 model was equilibrated in solvent containing 150 mm NaCl for 25 ns with the root mean square deviation (RMSD) over time, indicating a deviation from the originally produced model (Fig. 3a). This is due to compaction of the protein over the course of the MD simulation, as indicated by a lowering of dihedral angle energy (Fig. 3b), as shown in Fig. 3c at 5 ns of simulation compared with Fig. 3d, which has some secondary structure additions from the original structure and is in a more compact or well-folded state. To probe the binding motifs of PKCδI with NP627, we docked static .pdb files taken from the MD simulation at 5-ns intervals (Fig. 3e). These docking results were based on a box centered at residues DMQD of PKCδI. The predicted ΔG for binding to this region had the highest affinity at 15 ns, with the ΔG of the highest affinity in two poses indicating a predicted KD of 627 to PKCδI of ∼1 nm. Both poses are shown with ligand interaction diagrams (Fig. 3, f and g)"

Design Single centre prospective cohort study. Setting Two consecutive cohorts of tonsillectomy patients. Participants 124 patients (n = 55 treated with etoricoxib, n = 69 with metamizole); median age 30.5 years; 50% women. Main outcome measures Patients rated their pain on first postoperative day using the questionnaires of the German-wide project Quality Improvement in Postoperative Pain Treatment (QUIPS) including numeric rating scales (NRS, 0–10) for pain determination. The influence of preoperative and postoperative parameters on patients' pain was estimated by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. Results The demographic parameters showed no differences between the patients in the metamizole group and the etoricoxib group (all p>0.05) with one exception: Patients in the metamizole group had significantly more preoperative pain than patients in the etoricoxib group (p = 0.001). The metamizole group had a mean postoperative pain in activity of 4.4 ± 2.1 and the etoricoxib group of 4.5 ± 2.2. Maximal pain for the metamizole group and the etoricoxib group were 5.6 ± 2.2 and 6.1 ± 1.9, respectively. Pain in activity, maximal pain and minimal pain were not different between both groups (p = 0.652, p = 0.113, p = 0.276, respectively). Patients of the etoricoxib group received more frequently piritramide in recovery room as demand medication (p = 0.046). In the whole cohort, patients with peritonsillar abscess had more preoperative pain in comparison to chronic tonsillitis (p<0.001). Patients under 30.5 years reported higher maximal pain than older patients (p = 0.049). On the other hand, a significant influence of patients’ age on the pain in activity and minimal pain could not be demonstrated (p = 0.368, p = 0.508, respectively). Men reported lower minimal pain than women (p = 0.041). Also, patients with ASA status I had lower minimal pain than patients with higher ASA status (p = 0.019). The multivariate analysis did not show an association between postoperative pain in activity and preoperative counseling on postoperative pain management (p = 0.588, p = 0.174, respectively). Special preoperative counseling on postoperative pain management resulted in lower levels of maximal pain (p = 0.024). Linear regression demonstrated an independent association of higher pain in activity with higher mobility impairment (p = 0.034) and respiratory impairment (p = 0.002). The linear regression of minimal pain identified female gender (p = 0.005) as an independent influencing factor with higher pain levels. In terms of satisfaction, no preoperative pain therapy (p = 0.016) could be found as an independently significant influencing factor with higher satisfaction. Conclusion Etoricoxib does not have an advantage as baseline analgesic for post tonsillectomy pain in comparison to metamizole."
https://openalex.org/W2968983828,"Early and accurate diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley fever, is critical for appropriate disease treatment and management. Current serodiagnosis is based on the detection of patient serum antibodies that react with tube precipitin (TP) and complement fixation (CF) antigens of Coccidioides. IgM is the first class of antibodies produced by hosts in response to coccidioidal insults. The highly glycosylated β-glucosidase 2 (BGL2) is a major active component of the TP antigen that stimulates IgM antibody responses during early Coccidioides infection. The predominant IgM epitope on BGL2 is a unique 3-O-methyl-mannose moiety that is not produced by commonly used protein expression systems. We genetically engineered and expressed a recombinant BGL2 (rBGL2ur), derived from Coccidioides, in non-pathogenic Uncinocarpus reesii, a fungus phylogenetically related to the Coccidioides pathogen. The rBGL2ur protein was purified from the culture medium of transformed U. reesii by nickel affinity chromatography, and the presence of 3-O-methyl mannose was demonstrated by gas chromatography. Seroreactivity of the purified rBGL2ur protein was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using sera from 90 patients with coccidioidomycosis and 134 control individuals. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay with rBGL2ur were 78.8% and 87.3%, respectively. These results were comparable to those obtained using a proprietary MiraVista Diagnostic (MVD) IgM (63.3% sensitivity; 96.3% specificity), but significantly better than the ID-TP assay using non-concentrated patient sera (33.3% sensitivity; 100% specificity). Expression of rBGL2ur in U. reesii retains its antigenicity for coccidioidomycosis serodiagnosis and greatly reduces biosafety concerns for antigen production, as Coccidioides spp. are biological safety level 3 agents."
https://openalex.org/W2967055772,"Equine cardiovascular structures and function are routinely assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. Recently, investigators have described the echocardiographic visualization of equine pulmonary vein ostia. In companion animals, the right pulmonary vein (RPV) to right pulmonary artery (RPA) ratio has been used as an index to estimate the severity of cardiac diseases resulting in left ventricular volume overload. We sought to assess the feasibility of measuring RPV and RPA dimensions, and sought to provide various previously examined RPV and RPA variables in clinically healthy horses that could be used to assess cardiopulmonary disease status. Echocardiographic examination was prospectively performed in 70 healthy horses. The RPV and RPA were visualized using a modified right parasternal long-axis view and maximum and minimum diameters of both vessels were measured from 2D guided M-mode traces. The aortic diameter (Ao) was measured from the right parasternal short-axis view in early diastole. These measurements were then used to produce various ratio indices. RPV and RPA were imaged in all 70 horses. Median of the minimum and maximum RPV/RPA was 0.51 and 0.60, respectively. Median fractional dimensional change of vessels was 33% for RPV and 22% for RPA. The medians of the minimum and maximum RPV/Ao and RPA/Ao were 0.18, 0.28, 0.35 and 0.46, respectively. No relationships between either bodyweight or heart rate and any of the vein or artery variables were identified (maximum r2 = 0.04). Inter- and intra-observer measurement variability was very good for all RPV and RPA measurements. Measuring of RPV and RPA diameters using M-mode transthoracic echocardiography is feasible in healthy horses. Further studies of these variables in horses with cardiac diseases are needed to determine the clinical applicability and utility."

Objective The aim was to create clusters by using the clinical patterns of personality and to evaluate their influence on psychopathological variables. Methods Observational, analytical and cross-sectional study that included the PLKD from February 2009 to March 2017. The patients were referred to the Hospital Psychology Unit by the Transplant Coordination Unit. The total sample was composed of 100 participants. The socio-demographic characteristics, the relationship with the recipient and the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory were included. Results The final sample was composed by 100 PLKD. The mean age of the participants was 45.70, and most were women (70%). The analysis showed a final result of 3 personality clusters that best represented the data, in agreement with the DSM-5 classification. The PLKD from cluster 3 obtained greater scores in all the clinical syndromes. Conclusions The personality evaluation of the PLKD could help with the planning of monitoring protocols of the participants who were classified to cluster 3, in order to improve their post-transplant psychosocial adjustment. This result makes us consider the usefulness of the psychosocial evaluation to preserve the psychological health of the PLKD."
https://openalex.org/W2968163004,"Children whose parents have mental health disorders are at increased risk for deliberate self-harm (DSH). However, the effect of timing of parental mental health disorders on adolescent DSH risk remains under-researched. The aim of this study was to investigate how parental hospital admissions for mental health disorders and/or DSH in different developmental periods impact on the child's DSH risk in adolescence. A nested case-control sample was compiled from a total population cohort sample drawn from administrative health records in Western Australia. The sample comprised 7,151 adolescents who had a DSH-related hospital admission (cases), and 143,020 matched controls who hadn't had a DSH-related hospital admission. The occurrence of parental hospital admissions related to mental health disorders and/or DSH behaviours was then analysed for the cases and controls. The timing of the parental hospital admissions was partitioned into four stages in the child's life course: (1) pre-pregnancy, (2) pregnancy and infancy, (3) childhood, and (4) adolescence. We found that adolescents of a parent with mental health and/or DSH-related hospital admissions in all developmental periods except pregnancy and infancy were significantly more likely than controls to have a DSH-related hospital admission. Compared to parental hospital admissions that occurred during childhood and adolescence, those that occurred before pregnancy conferred a higher risk for adolescent DSH: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.25 for having only one parent hospitalised and 1.66 for having both parents hospitalised for mental health disorders; aOR = 1.97 for having any parent hospitalised for DSH, all being significant at the level of p < .001. This study shows that timing is important for understanding intergenerational transmission of DSH risk. The pre-pregnancy period is as critical as period after childbirth for effective intervention targeting adult mental health disorders and DSH, highlighting the important role of adult mental health services in preventing DSH risk in future generations."
