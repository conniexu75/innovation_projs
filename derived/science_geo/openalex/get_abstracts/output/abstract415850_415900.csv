https://openalex.org/W2138134399,"Resveratrol, a polyphenol in red wine, has been reported as a calorie restriction mimetic with potential antiaging and antidiabetogenic properties. It is widely consumed as a nutritional supplement, but its mechanism of action remains a mystery. Here, we report that the metabolic effects of resveratrol result from competitive inhibition of cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases, leading to elevated cAMP levels. The resulting activation of Epac1, a cAMP effector protein, increases intracellular Ca(2+) levels and activates the CamKKβ-AMPK pathway via phospholipase C and the ryanodine receptor Ca(2+)-release channel. As a consequence, resveratrol increases NAD(+) and the activity of Sirt1. Inhibiting PDE4 with rolipram reproduces all of the metabolic benefits of resveratrol, including prevention of diet-induced obesity and an increase in mitochondrial function, physical stamina, and glucose tolerance in mice. Therefore, administration of PDE4 inhibitors may also protect against and ameliorate the symptoms of metabolic diseases associated with aging."
https://openalex.org/W2023652080,"Efforts to study the development and function of the human cerebral cortex in health and disease have been limited by the availability of model systems. Extrapolating from our understanding of rodent cortical development, we have developed a robust, multistep process for human cortical development from pluripotent stem cells: directed differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to cortical stem and progenitor cells, followed by an extended period of cortical neurogenesis, neuronal terminal differentiation to acquire mature electrophysiological properties, and functional excitatory synaptic network formation. We found that induction of cortical neuroepithelial stem cells from human ES cells and human iPS cells was dependent on retinoid signaling. Furthermore, human ES cell and iPS cell differentiation to cerebral cortex recapitulated in vivo development to generate all classes of cortical projection neurons in a fixed temporal order. This system enables functional studies of human cerebral cortex development and the generation of individual-specific cortical networks ex vivo for disease modeling and therapeutic purposes."

Whether such structures normally exist in mammalian cells has, however, been the subject of active research for decades. Here we show that the G-quadruplex-interacting drug pyridostatin promotes growth arrest in human cancer cells by inducing replication- and transcription-dependent DNA damage. A chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis of the DNA damage marker γH2AX provided the genome-wide distribution of pyridostatin-induced sites of damage and revealed that pyridostatin targets gene bodies containing clusters of sequences with a propensity for G-quadruplex formation. As a result, pyridostatin modulated the expression of these genes, including the proto-oncogene SRC. We observed that pyridostatin reduced SRC protein abundance and SRC-dependent cellular motility in human breast cancer cells, validating SRC as a target of this drug. Our unbiased approach to define genomic sites of action for a drug establishes a framework for discovering functional DNA-drug interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2128471563,"Susceptibility to tuberculosis is historically ascribed to an inadequate immune response that fails to control infecting mycobacteria. In zebrafish, we find that susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum can result from either inadequate or excessive acute inflammation. Modulation of the leukotriene A(4) hydrolase (LTA4H) locus, which controls the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids, reveals two distinct molecular routes to mycobacterial susceptibility converging on dysregulated TNF levels: inadequate inflammation caused by excess lipoxins and hyperinflammation driven by excess leukotriene B(4). We identify therapies that specifically target each of these extremes. In humans, we identify a single nucleotide polymorphism in the LTA4H promoter that regulates its transcriptional activity. In tuberculous meningitis, the polymorphism is associated with inflammatory cell recruitment, patient survival and response to adjunctive anti-inflammatory therapy. Together, our findings suggest that host-directed therapies tailored to patient LTA4H genotypes may counter detrimental effects of either extreme of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2032787352,"Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is a circulating hepatokine that beneficially affects carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Here, we report that FGF21 is also an inducible, fed-state autocrine factor in adipose tissue that functions in a feed-forward loop to regulate the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), a master transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis. FGF21 knockout (KO) mice display defects in PPARγ signaling including decreased body fat and attenuation of PPARγ-dependent gene expression. Moreover, FGF21-KO mice are refractory to both the beneficial insulin-sensitizing effects and the detrimental weight gain and edema side effects of the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone. This loss of function in FGF21-KO mice is coincident with a marked increase in the sumoylation of PPARγ, which reduces its transcriptional activity. Adding back FGF21 prevents sumoylation and restores PPARγ activity. Collectively, these results reveal FGF21 as a key mediator of the physiologic and pharmacologic actions of PPARγ.

FGF21 is induced in adipose tissue by feeding and PPARγ agonists FGF21 increases PPARγ activity by preventing its sumoylation Loss of FGF21 results in impaired adipocyte function FGF21 mediates both beneficial and adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs Although white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a repository for fatty acids, it also plays a crucial role in regulating overall energy homeostasis (Spiegelman and Flier, 2001Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Obesity and the regulation of energy balance.Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1934) Google Scholar). Either too little or too much WAT contributes to metabolic abnormalities that include hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Thus, maintaining the appropriate amount of WAT is crucial for optimal health. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of ligand-activated transcription factors that is highly expressed in WAT (Chawla et al., 1994Chawla A. Schwarz E.J. Dimaculangan D.D.

PPARγ exists as two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2, with PPARγ2 containing an additional 30 amino acids at its amino terminus (Tontonoz et al., 1994aTontonoz P. Hu E. Graves R.A. Budavari A.I. Spiegelman B.M. mPPAR gamma 2: tissue-specific regulator of an adipocyte enhancer.Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1996) Google Scholar). PPARγ cooperates with the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors to regulate adipogenesis. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are present early during adipogenesis and induce PPARγ expression (Cao et al., 1991Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L.

C/EBPα is expressed later and together with PPARγ governs the adipocyte-specific pattern of gene expression (Lefterova et al., 2008Lefterova M.I. Zhang Y. Steger D.J. Schupp M. Schug J. Cristancho A.

Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although the identity of the endogenous PPARγ ligand is unknown, PPARγ is activated by various fatty acids and fatty acid metabolites as well as by the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of insulin-sensitizing drugs, which include rosiglitazone and pioglitazone (Tontonoz and Spiegelman, 2008Tontonoz P.

PPARγ activity is also regulated by posttranslational modification, including phosphorylation and sumoylation. Phosphorylation of PPARγ2 at S112 by MAP kinases represses its transcriptional activity by inhibiting ligand binding and altering cofactor recruitment (Adams et al., 1997Adams M. Reginato M.J.

Phosphorylation of PPARγ2 at S273 by CDK5 does not alter its adipogenic capacity but dysregulates numerous genes involved in obesity (Choi et al., 2010Choi J.H. Banks A.S. Estall J.L. Kajimura S.

Blüher M. et al.Anti-diabetic drugs inhibit obesity-linked phosphorylation of PPARgamma by Cdk5.Nature. 2010; 466: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Sumoylation of PPARγ2 at K107 blocks its transcriptional activity (Floyd and Stephens, 2004Floyd Z.E. Stephens J.M.

In macrophages, sumoylation of PPARγ2 at K395 results in its recruitment to the promoters of inflammatory genes, where it inhibits transcription by preventing clearance of corepressor complexes (Pascual et al., 2005Pascual G. Fong A.L. Ogawa S. Gamliel A. Li A.C. Perissi V. Rose D.W. Willson T.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K.

Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is an atypical member of the FGF family that functions as a hormone to regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. FGF21 was first shown to regulate metabolism in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, where it stimulated glucose uptake (Kharitonenkov et al., 2005Kharitonenkov A. Shiyanova T.L. Koester A. Ford A.M. Micanovic R. Galbreath E.J. Sandusky G.E. Hammond L.J. Moyers J.S. Owens R.A. et al.FGF-21 as a novel metabolic regulator.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). When administered pharmacologically to obese, insulin-resistant rodents and monkeys, FGF21 increased energy expenditure, insulin sensitivity, and weight loss, and normalized carbohydrate and lipid parameters (Berglund et al., 2009Berglund E.D.

FGF21 is strongly induced in liver in response to fasting or ketogenic diet (Badman et al., 2007Badman M.K. Pissios P. Kennedy A.R. Koukos G. Flier J.S. Maratos-Flier E.

Commun. 2007; 360: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in the adaptive fasting response, FGF21 stimulated hepatic ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis in lean mice (Potthoff et al., 2009Potthoff M.J. Inagaki T. Satapati S. Ding X. He T.

Mechanistically, FGF21 activates cell signaling by binding to a heteromeric cell-surface receptor tyrosine kinase complex composed of β-Klotho and a conventional FGF receptor (FGFR), with FGFR1c being the preferred isoform for FGF21 (Ogawa et al., 2007Ogawa Y.

Chem. 2007; 282: 26687-26695Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), where FGF21-regulated genes are involved in a variety of metabolic processes including lipogenesis, lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun T. Bina H.A. Schneider M.A. Dunbar J.D. Hu C.C. Chen Y. Moller D.E. Kharitonenkov A.

Based upon these findings, it was proposed that FGF21 induces futile cycling and energy expenditure in WAT (Coskun et al., 2008Coskun T. Bina H.A. Schneider M.A. Dunbar J.D. Hu C.C. Chen Y. Moller D.E. Kharitonenkov A. Fibroblast growth factor 21 corrects obesity in mice.Endocrinology. 2008; 149: 6018-6027Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). During fasting, FGF21 expression in liver is controlled by PPARα, and pharmacologic administration of PPARα agonists (e.g., the fibrate class of hypolipidemic drugs) induces hepatic expression of FGF21 (Badman et al., 2007Badman M.K.

Commun. 2007; 360: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, FGF21 is also induced by PPARγ agonists, including TZDs, in WAT and isolated adipocytes (Muise et al., 2008Muise E.S. Azzolina B. Kuo D.W. El-Sherbeini M. Tan Y. Yuan X. Mu J. Thompson J.R. Berger J.P. Wong K.K.

Serum FGF21 levels are increased in obesity and are independently associated with the metabolic syndrome in humans.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 1246-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). Although FGF21 and rosiglitazone were shown to cooperate in promoting differentiation and glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Moyers et al., 2007Moyers J.S. Shiyanova T.L. Mehrbod F. Dunbar J.D. Noblitt T.W. Otto K.A. Reifel-Miller A. Kharitonenkov A. Molecular determinants of FGF-21 activity-synergy and cross-talk with PPARgamma signaling.J. Cell. Physiol. 2007; 210: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), to our knowledge, the functional relationship between TZDs and FGF21 has not been explored in vivo. Here, we show that FGF21 acts in an autocrine fashion in WAT to regulate PPARγ activity, to enhance adipogenesis, and to contribute to both the therapeutic and side effects of TZDs. These studies reveal a previously unrecognized facet of FGF21 biology. A previous study showed that Fgf21 is induced by rosiglitazone in WAT of wild-type (WT) and db/db mice (Muise et al., 2008Muise E.S. Azzolina B. Kuo D.W. El-Sherbeini M. Tan Y. Yuan X. Mu J. Thompson J.R. Berger J.P. Wong K.K. Adipose fibroblast growth factor 21 is up-regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and altered metabolic states.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, FGF21 mRNA and protein levels were induced by rosiglitazone in WAT but not liver of WT mice (Figures 1A–1D ). Conversely, FGF21 mRNA and protein concentrations were increased by the PPARα agonist, GW7647, in liver but not WAT (Figures 1A–1D). Notably, whereas GW7647 markedly increased plasma FGF21 concentrations, rosiglitazone had no effect (Figure 1E). In experiments performed with isolated adipocytes, rosiglitazone but not GW7647 increased both FGF21 mRNA levels and protein concentrations in the media (Figure S1 available online). Taken together, these data suggest that FGF21 is secreted from WAT but acts locally in an autocrine or paracrine fashion instead of entering the circulation.Figure S1Rosiglitazone Treatment of Primary Adipocytes Induces FGF21 Expression and Secretion, Related to Figure 1Show full captionPreadipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction of WT mice were differentiated in vitro and treated with vehicle, GW7647 (10 nM) or rosiglitazone (rosi; 500 nM) for 48 hr.(A) Fgf21 mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR.(B) FGF21 protein was measured in the media by ELISA.Data are shown as the mean ± SEM; b, p < 0.01 versus vehicle.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Preadipocytes from the stromal vascular fraction of WT mice were differentiated in vitro and treated with vehicle, GW7647 (10 nM) or rosiglitazone (rosi; 500 nM) for 48 hr. (A) Fgf21 mRNA was measured by qRT-PCR. (B) FGF21 protein was measured in the media by ELISA. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM; b, p < 0.01 versus vehicle. To determine whether Fgf21 is induced in WAT by diet, Fgf21 mRNA levels were measured at 4 hr intervals in WAT and liver from mice restricted to feeding during a 4 hr period in the middle of the dark cycle. As expected, Fgf21 expression was highest in liver just prior to feeding (Figure 1F). In contrast, Fgf21 expression in WAT was very low during fasting but spiked 4 hr after feeding to an absolute level comparable to that seen in liver of fasted mice (Figure 1F). Thus, Fgf21 is induced in WAT by either TZD treatment or feeding. Under these conditions we saw no significant changes in the levels of circulating FGF21 (data not shown), which is consistent with increases in blood FGF21 concentrations requiring fasting for 24 hr or more (Muise et al., 2008Muise E.S. Azzolina B. Kuo D.W. El-Sherbeini M. Tan Y. Yuan X. Mu J. Thompson J.R. Berger J.P. Wong K.K. Adipose fibroblast growth factor 21 is up-regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and altered metabolic states.Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 74: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Given the regulation of Fgf21 in WAT, we examined whether FGF21 knockout (KO) mice have an adipose tissue phenotype. Although FGF21-KO mice had no change in body mass or fluid mass, they had a significant decrease in total fat mass and a significant increase in lean mass (Figures 2A–2D ). There was no difference in food intake between WT and FGF21-KO mice (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, FGF21-KO mice had significantly reduced amounts of epididymal, subcutaneous, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, and interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) (Figure 2E). There was no difference in the DNA content of epididymal WAT from WT and FGF21-KO mice (Figure 2F), indicating that the decreased adiposity was a consequence of smaller adipocytes rather than a decrease in adipocyte number. This difference in adipocyte size was confirmed by histomorphometry (Figures 2G and 2H). Similar effects on fat mass, lean mass, and epididymal, subcutaneous, and retroperitoneal adipose depot mass were seen in FGF21-KO mice crossed into the C57Bl/6 background (Figures S2A–S2E ). We note that two other groups reported increased adiposity in FGF21-KO mice (Badman et al., 2009Badman M.K. Koester A. Flier J.S. Kharitonenkov A. Maratos-Flier E.

A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the diets used by these groups contained soy, whereas ours did not.Figure S2Body Depot Analysis in FGF21-KO Mice on the C57Bl/6 Background, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A–E) The mass of various body depots was measured in 2.5-month-old male C57Bl/6 WT and FGF21-KO mice.

All data are shown as the mean ± SEM; a, p < 0.05 versus WT. To determine whether the adipose tissue phenotype was cell autonomous, we examined the differentiation of preadipocytes derived from WT and FGF21-KO mice. Fgf21 mRNA levels were low but detectable in WT preadipocytes prior to differentiation (Figure 3A ). Fgf21 expression decreased during the first day of differentiation but then rose steadily over the 8 day differentiation protocol. The mRNA encoding β-Klotho (Klb), an essential component of the FGF21 receptor (Ogawa et al., 2007Ogawa Y. Kurosu H. Yamamoto M. Nandi A. Rosenblatt K.P. Goetz R. Eliseenkova A.V. Mohammadi M.

Interestingly, Klb mRNA levels were lower in FGF21-KO adipocytes but restored by inclusion of recombinant FGF21 in the differentiation medium (Figure 3A). Expression of Fgfr1c, which encodes the other subunit of the FGF21 receptor, decreased during the early stages of differentiation and was unaffected by the absence of FGF21 (Figure 3A). These data suggest that FGF21 signaling initiates between days 2 and 4 of adipocyte differentiation. We next examined the temporal pattern of expression for a panel of genes that is expressed during the differentiation process.

Barrier-attached dynein captures microtubule ends and controls microtubule length Interaction between dynein and shrinking microtubules generates pulling forces Combined pushing and pulling forces reliably center microtubule asters Positioning due to pulling is explained by a theoretical model of aster mechanics In cells, the organization of the microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton is often dictated by the activity of MT-nucleating organelles such as the centrosome or the nucleus. For many cellular processes, it is essential that these so-called MT-organizing centers (MTOCs) faithfully position themselves with respect to the confining geometry of the cell. For example, in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos, asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle, organized by two MT-nucleating centrosomes (Figure 1A ), is necessary for establishment of the anterior-posterior axis (Cowan and Hyman, 2004Cowan C.R. Hyman A.A. Asymmetric cell division in C. elegans: cortical polarity and spindle positioning.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 427-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In budding and fission yeasts, the spindle and the nucleus need to be properly positioned for faithful localization of the mitotic plane (in the bud neck and in the cell center, respectively) (Carminati and Stearns, 1997Carminati J.L.

How fission yeast fission in the middle.Cell. 1996; 84: 191-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In migrating fibroblasts the position of the centrosome is implicated in the delivery of membrane vesicles to the leading edge of the cell (Schmoranzer et al., 2003Schmoranzer J. Kreitzer G. Simon S.M. Migrating fibroblasts perform polarized, microtubule-dependent exocytosis towards the leading edge.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4513-4519Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and in T cells it reinforces the initial polarity that has been established by the actin cytoskeleton (Stinchcombe et al., 2006Stinchcombe J.C. Majorovits E. Bossi G. Fuller S. Griffiths G.M. Centrosome polarization delivers secretory granules to the immunological synapse.Nature. 2006; 443: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). So how do MTOCs sense and control their position in cells of different size and shape? How do they ‘measure’ the distance to the cell periphery and harness the forces needed to adapt their position accordingly? Invariably, MTOC positioning appears to be mediated by the interaction of dynamic MTs with the cell cortex. The dynamics of MTs is characterized by a process termed dynamic instability: MTs alternate between growing and shrinking states that are separated by so-called catastrophe and rescue events (Desai and Mitchison, 1997Desai A. Mitchison T.J. Microtubule polymerization dynamics.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 83-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (1824) Google Scholar). It is by now well established that MT growth can lead to the generation of pushing forces (Dogterom et al., 2005Dogterom M. Kerssemakers J.W. Romet-Lemonne G. Janson M.E. Force generation by dynamic microtubules.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, Dogterom and Yurke, 1997Dogterom M. Yurke B.

Minus-end-directed motion of kinesin-coated microspheres driven by microtubule depolymerization.Nature. 1995; 373: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In some cases positioning is achieved by growth-induced MT pushing forces, for example during nuclear positioning in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells in interphase (Tran et al., 2001Tran P.T. Marsh L.

In most cases, however, positioning appears to be driven by dynein-mediated pulling forces generated at the cell cortex (Burakov et al., 2003Burakov A. Nadezhdina E. Slepchenko B. Rodionov V.

Important questions that thus need to be answered are how dynein at the cortex may be involved in the regulation of MT dynamics and length, how the dynein-MT interaction leads to the generation of cortical pulling forces, and how this may contribute to the correct positioning of MTOCs. In principle, dynein itself may be responsible for the generation of pulling forces, as dynein is a processive minus-end directed motor (Reck-Peterson et al., 2006Reck-Peterson S.L. Yildiz A. Carter A.P. Gennerich A. Zhang N. Vale R.D. Single-molecule analysis of dynein processivity and stepping behavior.Cell. 2006; 126: 335-348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar) that can pull on a MT-organizing center by moving laterally along the MT lattice, without the need for any direct interaction with the dynamic MT end. This type of ‘lateral’ cortical contact is observed in dividing Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells, where motion of the nucleus into the bud neck is mediated by MTs gliding along the cortex in a dynein-dependent manner (Carminati and Stearns, 1997Carminati J.L. Stearns T. Microtubules orient the mitotic spindle in yeast through dynein-dependent interactions with the cell cortex.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 629-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, dynein-MT interactions often appear to be accomplished in a configuration where the MT is facing the cortex ‘end-on’. In this configuration, dynein may act as a linker that allows the transmission of forces generated by shrinking MT ends, similar to what has been reported for other MT-associated end-binding (motor) proteins (Franck et al., 2007Franck A.D. Powers A.F. Gestaut D.R. Gonen T. Davis T.N. Asbury C.L. Tension applied through the Dam1 complex promotes microtubule elongation providing a direct mechanism for length control in mitosis.Nat.

Cell. 2001; 12: 3933-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we show in a series of in vitro experiments that, in an end-on configuration, barrier-attached dynein is able to regulate MT dynamics and to control MT length. We show that the interaction between dynein and shrinking MTs generates pulling forces of several pN. These pulling forces contribute to the precise centering of dynamic MT asters, when confined to simple symmetric microfabricated chambers with dynein attached to their sidewalls. We explain this result by a theoretical description of aster mechanics in the presence of pulling forces. Since cortical end-on MT-dynein interactions automatically tune MT length to the distance between MTOC and cell cortex, we propose that this system provides MTOCs with a reliable mechanisms to both sense and control their position in cells of different size and shape. We reconstituted the cortical interaction between dynein and dynamic MT ends in a minimal in vitro system. In our assays, dynamic MT ends interact with a microfabricated barrier coated with a truncated version of S. cerevisiae's cytoplasmic dynein, which was biotinylated after purification (GST-Dyn331, referred to hereafter as dynein). Previous experiments have shown that this truncated dynein exhibits processive minus-end-directed motility and stalls at a force (4.8 ± 1.0 pN) similar to full length dynein (Gennerich et al., 2007Gennerich A.

In our first experiments, fluorescently-labeled MTs grew from surface-attached centrosomes toward gold barriers (Figure 1B). By exploiting gold-specific-chemistry and surface blocking of the non-gold surfaces, dynein was attached specifically to the barriers through a multilayer of biotin-streptavidin linkages (Laan and Dogterom, 2010Laan L. Dogterom M.

Three-dimensional control of protein patterning in microfabricated devices.Nano Lett. 2005; 5: 2350-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (see also detail Figure 4A). We followed individual MTs over time using spinning disk confocal fluorescence microscopy. In the absence of dynein at the barrier, most MTs (91 out of 105) continued to grow and buckled upon reaching the barrier (Figure 1C and Movie S1, available online), while a minority of MTs (14 out of 105) stopped growing and remained straight. Both buckled and straight MTs sometimes switched to a shrinking state (this event is termed a catastrophe). For straight MTs this led to the immediate release from the barrier, while buckled MTs first straightened and then lost contact with the barrier. The release (i.e., catastrophe) frequency for straight MTs was higher than the catastrophe frequency for growing buckled MTs (0.22 ± 0.09 min-1 versus 0.024 ± 0.007 min-1; p-value 6.3∗10−5; Figures 1G and 1H) due to the generation of a compressive force, as previously observed (Janson et al., 2003Janson M.E. de Dood M.E. Dogterom M. Dynamic instability of microtubules is regulated by force.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The catastrophe frequency for buckled MTs was comparable to that of freely growing MTs under the same conditions (0.019 ± 0.006 min-1; p-value 0.26; Figure 1H, Table 1). In the presence of dynein, almost all MTs (60 out of 65) stopped growing after their ends hit the barrier (Figure 1D; Movie S2), whereas only a few were observed to continue to grow and buckle. In contrast to the situation without dynein, MTs remained in a straight conformation for very long times. The frequency at which these MTs were observed to release from the barrier (≈0.007min-1; < 0.016 min-1 with 95% confidence for 4 observed events) was much lower than in the absence of dynein (p-value 7.1∗10−8; Figures 1G and 1H: Multi). MTs were never observed to make lateral contact with the dynein-coated barrier (total of 20 centrosomes, at an average distance of 9.2 ± 4.2 μm, SD, from the barrier). These experiments show that barrier-attached dynein captures MT ends, stops MT growth, but also prevents MT shrinkage, thereby prolonging the contact time with the barrier, and tuning the MT length to the distance between the centrosome and the barrier.Table 1Parameters of MT Dynamics for Free and Gliding MTsn = events M = MTsFreely Growing from CentrosomeGliding on Dynein (no barrier)Gliding on Dynein (against barrier)Vgrowth (μm/min)1.3 +/− 0.4(M = 38)1.4 +/− 0.4(M = 20)-Vshrink (μm/min)7.5 +/− 2.0(M = 23)7.7 +/− 3.7(M = 16)3.4 +/− 0.8(M = 20)fcat (1/min)0.019 +/− 0.006(n = 11, M = 38)0.021 +/− 0.006(n = 14, M = 20)0.75 +/− 0.19(n = 18, M = 20)fres (1/min)<0.103 (95% conf)(n = 0, M = 38)0.67 +/− 0.30(n = 8, M = 20)- Open table in a new tab In these first experiments we attempted to maximize the surface density of dynein on the barriers by using a multilayer of biotin-streptavidin linkages. To investigate whether a high surface density of dynein molecules was required to trigger the observed effects, we reduced the dynein density on the gold barriers, first by using only a single biotin-streptavidin layer (100% dynein in Figures 1G and 1H), and second by diluting the biotinylated dynein with biotinylated bovine serum albumin (biotin-BSA; 10% and 1% dynein in Figures 1G and 1H). At lower dynein densities, we found fewer straight MTs in contact with the barriers and more growing, buckled MTs (Figure 1G). Also, the time MTs spent ‘searching’ for a stable contact at the barrier increased relative to the higher dynein concentration (Supplemental Information). The release frequency of the straight, non-growing MTs at the barriers remained however lower than when no dynein was present (p-values 100%: 6.8∗10−4, 10%: 0.0021, 1%: 0.089; Figure 1H). These observations show that dynein molecules do not need to be densely packed to be able to stabilize the MT contact with the barrier. The dynein-mediated stabilization of MT ends that we observe at the barriers could be due to either the inhibition of MT catastrophes or the stalling of subsequent MT shrinkage. We could sometimes observe how a growing buckled MT, after undergoing a catastrophe and shrinking back to a straight conformation, remained in contact with the barrier for some time (Figure 1E; Movie S3). This suggests that catastrophes are not prevented by the capture of MT ends, but that shrinkage is stalled as soon as the MT is pulled straight between the surface-attached centrosome and the dynein contact point. In fact, the catastrophe frequency of growing buckled MTs at low dynein coverage (1% and 10%) was higher than in the complete absence of dynein (p-values 1%: 0.012, 10%: 0.0033; Figure 1H), suggesting that barrier-attached dynein rather enhances catastrophes (for 100% and Multi, too few buckled MTs and catastrophe events were observed to confirm that the catastrophe frequency was enhanced). To further test whether barrier-attached dynein prolongs MT contact by preventing catastrophes or by stalling shrinkage, we performed an experiment similar to Figure 1, in which in addition to the barrier, the bottom surface of the sample was coated with dynein molecules. In this case, growing MTs were pulled loose from the centrosome and glided toward the barrier (Figure 2; Movie S4). When these MTs hit the barrier, they quickly underwent a catastrophe (fcat = 0.75 ± 0.19 min-1; Table 1), but the shrinking MT ends stayed in contact with the barrier. The subsequent shrinkage velocity was much slower (3.4 ± 0.8 μm/min, SD) than in the case of centrosome-nucleated MTs shrinking freely under the same conditions (7.5 ± 2.0 μm/min, SD) (p-value 3.1∗10−10; Table 1). The shrinkage velocity was also slower than the dynein gliding velocity (7.8 ± 2.1 μm/min, SD), which means that both MT shrinkage and dynein motion were slowed down by the dynein-MT interaction at the barrier. We thus conclude that barrier-attached dynein does not prevent, but rather enhances catastrophes, and slows down (or even stalls, see Figure 1D) subsequent MT shrinkage. To test whether dynein induces catastrophes by a putative depolymerizing activity, we also performed gliding experiments with MTs that were stabilized with GMPCPP, a slowly hydrolysable analog of GTP. These stabilized MTs stopped moving along the bottom surface when they contacted the barrier, but shrinkage was never observed (Figures S2A and S2B).Figure S1Detecting Slipping and Buckling of MTs, Related to Figure 1Show full captionTo test our visual method to detect slipping versus captured MTs, and straight versus buckled MTs, we tracked a subset of MTs, quantified their behavior, and compared this to our visual analysis.

We manually track the position of the end over time and record the component s of the displacement parallel to the barrier. (B) Cartoon that shows how the buckled/straight state of the MT is quantified. We manually track three points on the MT. The end of the MT, x→1, the middle of the MT, x→2, and the attachment of the MT at the centrosome x→3.

The MT is initially (slightly) buckled, until it is captured and straightens around 150-160 s.From these graphs we can determine whether MTs are slipping or captured, and buckled or straight. We consider MTs to be captured if their ends remain more than 5 frames (corresponding to 15 s) at the same position (spatial resolution is limited by the pixel size). We consider MTs to be straight if C < 1.005 (note however that strongly buckled MTs can have values of C around 1.2-1.3). We compared the tracking method with a visual analysis for 10 arbitrarily picked MTs at 100% dynein, without a multilayer of biotinylated-BSA and streptavidin (see Figure 1E). We found, using the tracking versus the visual method: a total time buckled of 1500 versus 1688 s, a total time straight of 2454 versus 2270 s, a total time captured (straight) of 1676 versus 1688 s, and a total time slipping of 2159 versus 2230 s. From this comparison we conclude that we do not find significant differences (given the error bars) between the two methods.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure S2Effects of Dynein on MT Dynamics, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A,B) Barrier-attached dynein does not depolymerize GMPCPP-stabilized MTs. In (A), a time sequence of a GMPCPP-stabilized MT is shown that glides on a dynein-coated surface against a dynein-coated barrier (as in Figure 2). When the MT hits the barrier it buckles and eventually glides along the barrier. In (B), a kymograph of another GMPCPP-stabilized MT that glides against a barrier is shown (the edge of the barrier is indicated with a yellow line, to reveal the movement of the MT end). The first ∼120 s the MT glides toward the barrier. As soon as it hits the barrier it stops gliding but does not depolymerize. After ∼250 s, the GMPCPP-stabilized MT end repositions on the barrier, and again stops moving. All GMPCPP-stabilized MTs we observed stopped moving against the barrier or started gliding along it. No depolymerization was observed. An upper estimate for the shrinkage velocity is given by ∼0.2 nm/sec, which is much slower than the depolymerization velocity of ∼65 nm/sec reported for the depolymerizing kinesin protein MCAK (Helenius et al., 2006Helenius, J., Brouhard, G., Kalaidzidis, Y., Diez, S., and Howard, J.

https://openalex.org/W2124042578,"Polycomb repressor complexes (PRCs) are important chromatin modifiers fundamentally implicated in pluripotency and cancer. Polycomb silencing in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be accompanied by active chromatin and primed RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), but the relationship between PRCs and RNAPII remains unclear genome-wide. We mapped PRC repression markers and four RNAPII states in ESCs using ChIP-seq, and found that PRC targets exhibit a range of RNAPII variants. First, developmental PRC targets are bound by unproductive RNAPII (S5p(+)S7p(-)S2p(-)) genome-wide. Sequential ChIP, Ring1B depletion, and genome-wide correlations show that PRCs and RNAPII-S5p physically bind to the same chromatin and functionally synergize. Second, we identify a cohort of genes marked by PRC and elongating RNAPII (S5p(+)S7p(+)S2p(+)); they produce mRNA and protein, and their expression increases upon PRC1 knockdown. We show that this group of PRC targets switches between active and PRC-repressed states within the ESC population, and that many have roles in metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2118730986,"Although it is believed that neural activation can affect immune responses, very little is known about the neuroimmune interactions involved, especially the regulators of immune traffic across the blood-brain barrier which occurs in neuroimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Using a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, we show that autoreactive T cells access the central nervous system via the fifth lumbar spinal cord. This location is defined by IL-6 amplifier-dependent upregulation of the chemokine CCL20 in associated dorsal blood vessels, which in turn depends on gravity-induced activation of sensory neurons by the soleus muscle in the leg. Impairing soleus muscle contraction by tail suspension is sufficient to reduce localized chemokine expression and block entry of pathogenic T cells at the fifth lumbar cord, suggesting that regional neuroimmune interactions may offer therapeutic targets for a variety of neurological diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1969645371,"Behavior cannot be predicted from a ""connectome"" because the brain contains a chemical ""map"" of neuromodulation superimposed upon its synaptic connectivity map. Neuromodulation changes how neural circuits process information in different states, such as hunger or arousal. Here we describe a genetically based method to map, in an unbiased and brain-wide manner, sites of neuromodulation under different conditions in the Drosophila brain. This method, and genetic perturbations, reveal that the well-known effect of hunger to enhance behavioral sensitivity to sugar is mediated, at least in part, by the release of dopamine onto primary gustatory sensory neurons, which enhances sugar-evoked calcium influx. These data reinforce the concept that sensory neurons constitute an important locus for state-dependent gain control of behavior and introduce a methodology that can be extended to other neuromodulators and model organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2086876386,"Cell fate decisions are driven through the integration of inductive signals and tissue-specific transcription factors (TFs), although the details on how this information converges in cis remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the five genetic components essential for cardiac specification in Drosophila, including the effectors of Wg and Dpp signaling, act as a collective unit to cooperatively regulate heart enhancer activity, both in vivo and in vitro. Their combinatorial binding does not require any specific motif orientation or spacing, suggesting an alternative mode of enhancer function whereby cooperative activity occurs with extensive motif flexibility. A fraction of enhancers co-occupied by cardiogenic TFs had unexpected activity in the neighboring visceral mesoderm but could be rendered active in heart through single-site mutations. Given that cardiac and visceral cells are both derived from the dorsal mesoderm, this “dormant” TF binding signature may represent a molecular footprint of these cells' developmental lineage.

Collective binding of five transcription factors promotes cardiac enhancer activity Enhancer co-occupancy does not require specific spacing or orientation of binding sites Some “cardiac” enhancers are active in another tissue, the visceral mesoderm The dormant cardiac binding signature reflects the developmental history of the tissue Pluripotent cells become progressively restricted in their cell fate through the action of inductive signals from surrounding tissues and specific cohorts of transcription factors (TFs). This multilevel information converges on cis-regulatory modules (CRMs, or enhancer elements) to elicit specific developmental programs. Information at some CRMs is integrated through cooperative TF binding, mediated via direct protein-protein interactions between TFs or common cofactors. Cooperative occupancy often requires a specific orientation, relative spacing, and helical phasing of TF-binding sites (Senger et al., 2004Senger K. Armstrong G.W. Rowell W.J. Kwan J.M. Markstein M. Levine M. Immunity regulatory DNAs share common organizational features in Drosophila.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 19-32Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), referred to as motif grammar, to facilitate the appropriate protein interactions. A classic example of this is the enhanceosome model of enhancer activation (Panne, 2008Panne D. The enhanceosome.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2008; 18: 236-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, this stringent enhanceosome mode of regulation may represent only a small fraction of enhancers. Many developmental enhancers operate under more flexible conditions in which a subset of factors may bind cooperatively while the remaining factors are recruited independently and thus require little or no motif grammar. The billboard model, for example, suggests that TFs do not function in a single concerted manner at enhancers; rather, submodules interact independently and/or redundantly with the basal transcriptional machinery (Kulkarni and Arnosti, 2003Kulkarni M.M. Arnosti D.N. Information display by transcriptional enhancers.Development. 2003; 130: 6569-6575Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In some cases, enhancer flexibility appears even more extreme—not only can the relative location of binding sites vary, but also the identity of the TFs that are involved in regulating a specific pattern of expression (Brown et al., 2007Brown C.D.

The specification of the Drosophila dorsal mesoderm into visceral mesoderm (VM) and cardiac mesoderm (CM) cell fates represents an excellent paradigm for complex enhancer integration (Halfon et al., 2000Halfon M.S.

Frasch M. Early signals in cardiac development.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 457-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Here, cell fate decisions are induced through the intersection of ectodermal Wingless (Wg, a Wnt protein) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a TGF-β family protein) signaling (Figure 1A ). Pluripotent cells that receive both signals within the underlying dorsal mesoderm are specified to become CM, and the neighboring cell population that only receives Dpp signal becomes VM (Lee and Frasch, 2000Lee H.H.

Tinman (Tin, an Nkx factor) and pMad (the effector of Dpp signaling) provide the competence for these “precursor cells” to acquire either a VM or CM cell fate (Xu et al., 1998Xu X. Yin Z. Hudson J.B. Ferguson E.L. Frasch M. Smad proteins act in combination with synergistic and antagonistic regulators to target Dpp responses to the Drosophila mesoderm.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2354-2370Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In particular, Tin acts together with Pannier (Pnr, a GATA factor) and Dorsocross (Doc, a T box factor) to specify CM cell fate (Reim and Frasch, 2005Reim I. Frasch M. The Dorsocross T-box genes are key components of the regulatory network controlling early cardiogenesis in Drosophila.Development. 2005; 132: 4911-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas the VM fate is actively repressed in these cells (Lee and Frasch, 2005Lee H.H.

Genetic studies in both Drosophila and mice suggest that the cis-regulatory network driving cardiac specification is highly cooperative. For example, although Nkx, GATA and T box factors are essential for heart development in all species studied to date (Cripps and Olson, 2002Cripps R.M. Olson E.N.

Rather, the ectopic expression of combinations of TFs is required to drive the cardiogenic program in both flies (Reim and Frasch, 2005Reim I. Frasch M.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3405-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) (Figure 1C). Moreover, combinations of GATA4, Tbx5, and a third factor are sufficient to drive transdifferentiation of cell types into a CM cell fate (Takeuchi and Bruneau, 2009Takeuchi J.K. Bruneau B.G. Directed transdifferentiation of mouse mesoderm to heart tissue by defined factors.Nature. 2009; 459: 708-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and to direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into cardiomyocytes (Ieda et al., 2010Ieda M. Fu J.D. Delgado-Olguin P. Vedantham V. Hayashi Y. Bruneau B.G. Srivastava D. Direct reprogramming of fibroblasts into functional cardiomyocytes by defined factors.Cell. 2010; 142: 375-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1884) Google Scholar), and yet, the molecular nature of this cooperativity is very poorly understood. Despite the extensive genetic characterization of CM specification, only a handful of enhancers are known to regulate early stages of heart development (Figures S1A–S1G available online), precluding any general hypotheses on how the input from multiple TFs (Tin, Pnr, Doc, and the effectors of Wg and Dpp signaling) converges in cis. For example, it is not known if the cooperativity observed between these factors at a genetic level (Figures 1C and 1D) is reflected at the cis-regulatory level and requires a specific motif grammar at the sequence level. To address these issues, we examined the genome-wide occupancy of pMad, dTCF, Doc, Pnr, and the mesoderm-specific factor Tin during dorsal mesoderm specification in Drosophila embryos. We find that all five TFs are recruited to shared enhancers to a much higher degree than expected by chance and do so in a mesoderm-specific context, matching their only domain of coexpression (Figure 1B). These regions function as heart enhancers in vivo and require the presence of all five TFs for their cooperative regulation and maximal enhancer activity in vitro. The collective enhancer occupancy, which we further confirm using a cell culture model and mutagenesis analysis in vivo, occurs in the absence of any consistent motif grammar, revealing an alternative mode of cooperative regulation using very flexible motif content. Our analysis also uncovered an additional property of developmental enhancers, whereby dormant TF binding signatures reflect a developmental footprint of a cell's lineage. “Cardiac” TFs occupy enhancer elements that are active in the neighboring VM, echoing the fact that both cell populations are derived from the dorsal mesoderm. To generate a TF binding atlas of regulatory regions active in the dorsal mesoderm, we performed genome-wide ChIP-on-chip experiments with antibodies directed against Doc, Pnr, dTCF, and pMad, the activated phosphorylated form of the Dpp effector Mad. The experiments were performed at two consecutive stages of development: 4–6 hr after egg lay (stages 8 and 9) and 6–8 hr (stages 10 and 11), corresponding to the subdivision of the dorsal mesoderm and its subsequent specification into CM and VM (Campos-Ortega, 1997Campos-Ortega J.A. The Embryonic Development of Drosophila Melanogaster. Springer-Verlag, New York1997Crossref Google Scholar). A high confidence set of TF-bound regions was defined for each factor, identifying thousands of occupied sites per TF (Table S1 and Extended Experimental Procedures). These data were combined with Tin occupancy data generated under the same conditions at the same stages of development (Zinzen et al., 2009Zinzen R.P. Girardot C. Gagneur J. Braun M. Furlong E.E. Combinatorial binding predicts spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity.Nature. 2009; 462: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The pairwise occupancy patterns of all five TFs showed highly significant overlap (Figures S2E and S2F ), providing an initial indication that these factors occupy common cis-regulatory elements. To convert TF binding peaks into co-occupied enhancers, binding events that clustered in close proximity to each other were merged to define putative cis-regulatory regions, as described previously (Zinzen et al., 2009Zinzen R.P. Girardot C. Gagneur J. Braun M. Furlong E.E. Combinatorial binding predicts spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity.Nature. 2009; 462: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In this way, the combined 55,423 significant TF binding peaks clustered into 11,286 nonredundant CRMs, approximately one-third of which (4,041) have significant levels of Tinman binding. Though tinman expression is restricted to the mesoderm, the expression of the other four TFs is not, even within these narrow time windows of development (Figure 1B). We used Tin binding to limit our analysis to CRMs more likely to be active in mesodermal lineages and therefore focused for the remainder of this study on the 4,041 Tin-bound CRMs, the majority of which also recruited other factors (Table S2). The TF occupancy patterns fully recapitulated all known binding to previously characterized dorsal mesoderm enhancers and the four known early cardiac enhancers active at the analyzed stages (Figures S1A–S1H) and in many cases revealed additional regulatory connections, demonstrating the sensitivity and resolution of the data. To extend this further, we selected 50 genes with at least Tin, Doc, and Pnr binding in their vicinity and examined their expression patterns by double-fluorescent in situ hybridization. Forty-two of these genes gave specific spatiotemporal expression, 38 of which (90%) are expressed in the dorsal mesoderm (26 genes) and/or cardiac mesoderm (20) and/or visceral mesoderm (7) (Figures S1I–S1K and Table S3). This supports our reasoning that the integration of binding signatures for four nonmesoderm-specific TFs (pMad, dTCF, Pnr, and Doc) with Tin is a valid approach to focus on transcriptional regulation within the dorsal mesoderm and its derivatives. To relate TF binding signatures to specific cis-regulatory function, we applied an unbiased clustering approach to assess general TF preferences for enhancer co-occupancy, followed by extensive in vivo transgenic reporter analyses to assess enhancer activity. The maximum moving average ChIP signal for each TF at each enhancer was used as a quantitative input for enhancer classification. As enhancers were defined based on high-confidence binding signals for at least one TF, this procedure ensured that subthreshold signals for all other TFs were taken into account for enhancer classification (Extended Experimental Procedures). The Bayesian clustering algorithm Autoclass (Cheeseman, 1996Cheeseman P. Bayesian Classification (AutoClass): Theory and Results.in: Fayyad U.M. Piatetsky-Shapiro G. Smyth P. Uthurusamy R. Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. AAAI Press/MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1996Google Scholar) was used to partition enhancers based on their similarity in TF binding signatures across all experiments, computing a probability score for each enhancer to belong to each cluster. This approach produced confident single-cluster assignments for 77% (3,099) of the 4,041 Tin-bound enhancers (Figure 2A , left heatmap, and Table S4), and the robustness of this classification was confirmed by bootstrap analysis (Extended Experimental Procedures). Examining the signal distribution of TF occupancy in each cluster revealed six broad enhancer classes that are qualitatively distinct from each other (Figures 2A, left, S2A, and Extended Experimental Procedures). The first class harbors enrichment for all five TFs (Figures 2A, left, “All TF” CRMs labeled with shades of red, and S2A, upper-left). The second class, in contrast, is depleted in binding signal for all TFs except Tin and represents ∼20% of CRMs (“Tin only,” labeled with shades of gray in Figure 2A). The four remaining classes are defined by elevated signals for Tin and one additional TF, with generally medium to low signals for other factors. We loosely refer to these as “two TF” classes as follows: “pMad+Tin” (∼2% CRMs), “dTCF+Tin” (∼8%), “Doc+Tin” (∼4%), and “Pnr+Tin” (∼20% CRMs) (Figures 2A, left, and S2A). Individual clusters within each of these classes differ in the quantitative levels of TF binding signals but generally not in the identity of the TFs themselves (Figures 2A and S2A and Extended Experimental Procedures). CRM clusters with the most prominent binding profiles from each class were used for further analysis (Figures 2C and S2A, boxed histograms, and Extended Experimental Procedures). This unbiased grouping of enhancers, based on their similarity in TF occupancy, revealed two unexpected findings. First, the most prominent binding signature at enhancers is the recruitment of all five TFs. Depending on the threshold of the mean TF binding signal per class (Extended Experimental Procedures), between 22% and 46% of classified enhancers have highly correlated signals for Doc, dTCF, pMad, Pnr, and Tin across one or both developmental times (Figures 2A, left, labeled with shades of red from high TF binding signal [top] to low [bottom], and S2A). Second, there are few enhancers bound at high levels by three or four TFs; instead, the majority of regions are either occupied by all five factors or have high enrichment for only two factors (TF+Tin). This suggests that all five factors bind to these elements as a collective unit, which may require a specific mesodermal context to anchor their binding. To test this further, we applied the same clustering procedure to enhancers that are significantly bound by one or more TF but are not bound by Tin (the mesoderm-specific factor) at the analyzed stages of development (1,209 CRMs with near-zero Tin signal; Table S2). On these Tin-negative regions, there is very little correlated co-occupancy of the other four TFs (Figure 2A, right). This was further confirmed on a stringent set of enhancers that are highly enriched for two or more TFs other than Tin, whereas the signal for the remaining analyzed TFs is below the lower 50% of the background signal distribution (Figure 2B). The occupancy of Doc, dTCF, pMad, and Pnr at these “all or nothing” CRMs is strikingly different depending on the presence of Tin binding (Figure 2B). More globally, the degree of TF co-occupancy is significantly higher at Tin-bound regions, but not Tin-negative regions, compared to that expected at random (Figures S2B–S2D). Taken together, these data indicate that all five TFs tend to be corecruited to regulatory regions in a concerted manner (as further confirmed using a cell-based system below), which occurs in a mesoderm-specific context (Tin-bound CRMs), in keeping with their only domain of coexpression (Figure 1B). Having defined specific classes of enhancers with qualitatively different TF occupancy patterns, we assessed which of these represent active enhancers in vivo and drive expression in the dorsal mesoderm and/or in cardiac cells. ChIP-defined enhancers (average size 550 bp) were cloned upstream of a GFP reporter gene and stably integrated into the Drosophila genome. Enhancer spatiotemporal activity throughout embryonic development was assayed by in situ hybridization in transgenic embryos to provide accurate temporal resolution for when the enhancer is active. Importantly, the selection of enhancers was based purely on representative binding signatures, without prior knowledge concerning the function of neighboring genes or the motif content of the enhancers. In total, the activities of 55 regions were examined in transgenic embryos, almost half of which correspond to the All TF binding class (47%), as this represents the most predominant TF binding signature (Figure 3, Figure 3, and S3 and Table S5). A striking 92% of enhancers tested from the All TF class (24 of 26 regions) were sufficient to function as enhancers in vivo. The vast majority of these (91.6%; 22/24) regulate expression in mesodermal lineages (Figure 3A), of which the most prominent expression signature (50%; 12 CRMs) is activity within the cardiogenic mesoderm (Figures 3B and S3A). These complex spatial patterns of enhancer activity cannot be achieved through the action of any one TF alone but, rather, reflect the intersection in expression domains of many of these factors, in line with their observed collective occupancy. The second most prominent activity (25%) was VM expression, which was surprising given the collective occupancy of all five “cardiogenic” TFs at these CRMs and is dissected in detail below. The activity of approximately seven CRMs was tested for each of the four two-TF classes, of which 59% (17/29) function as enhancers in vivo (detailed results are shown in Figure S3). Eighty-eight percent (15/17) of active regions regulate activity in mesodermal tissues, including the early trunk, ventral, dorsal, and visceral mesoderm. However, in contrast to the All TF CRMs, only four regions (23%) regulate activity in CM, with all but one CRM belonging to the dTCF+Tin class (Figures 3A and S3). In summary, regions co-occupied by all five TFs were much more likely to direct expression in the dorsal mesoderm (or its derivatives) compared to any of the two-TF classes, with 75% (18/24) of active All TF CRMs driving specific expression in CM or VM. It is important to note that Tin binding in the absence of Doc, Pnr, pMad, and dTCF is not sufficient to regulate enhancer activity in cardiac cells, as demonstrated by extensive analyses of enhancers bound by Tin in combination with other TFs (Liu et al., 2009Liu Y.H. Jakobsen J.S. Valentin G. Amarantos I. Gilmour D.T. Furlong E.E. A systematic analysis of Tinman function reveals Eya and JAK-STAT signaling as essential regulators of muscle development.Dev.

Combinatorial binding predicts spatio-temporal cis-regulatory activity.Nature. 2009; 462: 65-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of Tin within the cardiogenic TF collective has unique properties in terms of its functional output. Given the extensive corecruitment of the five TFs, we asked whether the motif content of the All TF enhancers explains their collective occupancy and activity. We first determined the general sequence preferences of each TF using de novo motif discovery on all regions bound by that factor (Extended Experimental Procedures). The identified position weight matrices (PWMs), which were similar to published models (Figure S4A ), were then used to assess differential motif enrichment between All TF CRMs and two-TF CRMs (Figure 4). This analysis revealed two classes of TFs, suggesting different modes of their recruitment to DNA. Doc and Pnr transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are preferentially found in All TF CRMs compared to their respective two-TF CRMs, whereas, in contrast, the numbers of TFBSs for pMad, dTCF, and Tin are lower in All TF CRMs compared to their respective two-TF CRMs (Figure 4B). This holds true regardless of which specific PWM score threshold is used for the motif detection (data not shown) or when using an unthresholded approach summarizing both high- and low-affinity TFBSs (TRAP, Roider et al., 2007Roider H.G. Kanhere A. Manke T. Vingron M. Predicting transcription factor affinities to DNA from a biophysical model.Bioinformatics. 2007; 23: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar; Figure 4C). The differential motif enrichment of Doc and Pnr compared to pMad, dTCF, and Tin was further confirmed using de novo motif analysis (Figure S4B).Figure 4Sequence Properties of All TF CRMs versus Two TF CRMsShow full caption(A) Motifs discovered de novo for Doc, Pnr, pMad, dTCF, and Tin in all regions bound by the respective TF are similar to those reported previously (Figure S4A).(B) Enrichment of TF-binding sites in different CRM classes.

In contrast, pMad, dTCF, and Tin have lower cumulative motif scores in All TF CRMs compared to their respective two-TF CRMs (pMad p = 2.3 × 10−8, dTCF p = 6.7 × 10−6, Tin p = 8.8 × 10−11).

Cumulative motif scores (computed using TRAP) are normalized to the median value for each TF. See also Figure S4. The enrichment of Doc and Pnr TFBSs suggests that these factors are preferentially recruited to All TF CRMs in a sequence-specific fashion (Figures 4B and 4C), and consistent with this, their motifs are more conserved in All TF CRMs compared to their respective two-TF classes (data not shown). Conversely, the number of pMad, dTCF, and Tin sites are lower in All TF CRMs compared to their respective two-TF CRMs, which is particularly striking for dTCF (Figures 4B and 4C), suggesting that heterotypic cooperative binding may play a role in their recruitment to All TF CRMs. A role for cooperativity in this system is supported by direct protein-protein interactions between almost all of these TFs in both Drosophila and vertebrates (Brown et al., 2004Brown III, C.O.

Anticipated novel therapeutic implementations of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and their derivatives further increase interest in strategies to expand HSCs ex vivo. A fundamental limitation in all HSC-driven culture systems is the rapid generation of differentiating cells and their secreted inhibitory feedback signals. Herein we describe an integrated computational and experimental strategy that enables a tunable reduction in the global levels and impact of paracrine signaling factors in an automated closed-system process by employing a controlled fed-batch media dilution approach. Application of this system to human cord blood cells yielded a rapid (12-day) 11-fold increase of HSCs with self-renewing, multilineage repopulating ability. These results highlight the marked improvements that control of feedback signaling can offer primary stem cell culture and demonstrate a clinically relevant rapid and relatively low culture volume strategy for ex vivo HSC expansion."

However, the hormone-activated molecular mechanisms that control the development and function of the underlying neural circuits remain poorly defined. We have identified numerous sexually dimorphic gene expression patterns in the adult mouse hypothalamus and amygdala. We find that adult sex hormones regulate these expression patterns in a sex-specific, regionally restricted manner, suggesting that these genes regulate sex typical behaviors. Indeed, we find that mice with targeted disruptions of each of four of these genes (Brs3, Cckar, Irs4, Sytl4) exhibit extremely specific deficits in sex specific behaviors, with single genes controlling the pattern or extent of male sexual behavior, male aggression, maternal behavior, or female sexual behavior. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that various components of sexually dimorphic behaviors are governed by separable genetic programs.PaperFlickeyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiIxYzg0YmE4NDU5ZjI5MGJiMDkzMTllNTA3Y2U1MmZhOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjM0NzY5NjIxfQ.ldQeswtQkN5aTAO4s6ebdvsS_PQFw5KJhcup4_e0IoK80C8RfeecW9nUdsyeXTtKOVV9S8M1H_rBJysPUJJR8MITVa8VjBCpRPc0GSRWIcRU2RbHoCOaAYPtw4VwG-hppg6iRX2zeV20wvm7P_Dw9b9G442EYlZYlraHvQ9W2PVv6rXLoGPR2rmXUHzp-uZR44yllxvlxIpzkg1BiUB5HpAVJx4ekiyiGKVygkDG7-qqKzP-Qb5jhq5qVxbun9o_mtsGxs10cc6_qR4Nq5zM21E1dr_UuPNuzdiRaE6OPugK4IzqQ6cuslU-tiq8EtoJW1tSRMPkHNvOjcUaWlst0Q(mp4, (11.37 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W2010280142,"The multiprotein kinetochore complex must assemble at a specific site on each chromosome to achieve accurate chromosome segregation. Defining the nature of the DNA-protein interactions that specify the position of the kinetochore and provide a scaffold for kinetochore formation remain key goals. Here, we demonstrate that the centromeric histone-fold-containing CENP-T-W and CENP-S-X complexes coassemble to form a stable CENP-T-W-S-X heterotetramer. High-resolution structural analysis of the individual complexes and the heterotetramer reveals similarity to other histone fold-containing complexes including canonical histones within a nucleosome. The CENP-T-W-S-X heterotetramer binds to and supercoils DNA. Mutants designed to compromise heterotetramerization or the DNA-protein contacts around the heterotetramer strongly reduce the DNA binding and supercoiling activities in vitro and compromise kinetochore assembly in vivo. These data suggest that the CENP-T-W-S-X complex forms a unique nucleosome-like structure to generate contacts with DNA, extending the “histone code” beyond canonical nucleosome proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2038201483,"The ability to redesign enzymes to catalyze noncognate chemical transformations would have wide-ranging applications. We developed a computational method for repurposing the reactivity of metalloenzyme active site functional groups to catalyze new reactions. Using this method, we engineered a zinc-containing mouse adenosine deaminase to catalyze the hydrolysis of a model organophosphate with a catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of ~10(4) M(-1) s(-1) after directed evolution. In the high-resolution crystal structure of the enzyme, all but one of the designed residues adopt the designed conformation. The designed enzyme efficiently catalyzes the hydrolysis of the R(P) isomer of a coumarinyl analog of the nerve agent cyclosarin, and it shows marked substrate selectivity for coumarinyl leaving groups. Computational redesign of native enzyme active sites complements directed evolution methods and offers a general approach for exploring their untapped catalytic potential for new reactivities."

Stem cell biology offers promise for understanding the origins and progression of breast and other cancers and may also reveal the next generation of molecular targets for breast cancers not susceptible to current agents. For example, basal-like breast cancers are poorly differentiated and exhibit gene expression similarities to embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (Ben-Porath et al., 2008Ben-Porath I. Thomson M.W. Carey V.J. Ge R. Bell G.W. Regev A. Weinberg R.A. An embryonic stem cell-like gene expression signature in poorly differentiated aggressive human tumors.Nat.

Breast cancer cells that generate xenografted tumors with high efficiency, regenerate the cellular complexity of the originating tumor, and self-renew (as defined by secondary transplantation) exhibit properties attributed to stem cells and have consequently been called breast cancer stem cells (Al-Hajj et al., 2003Al-Hajj M.

However, aMaSC rarity combined with the cellular complexity of the adult gland make purification challenging (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K.

The developing mammary gland is less complex than the adult gland, suggesting that it may facilitate stem cell identification and purification. Furthermore, while the extensive proliferation, migration, and invasion required for mammogenesis do not occur in the resting adult mammary gland, they do resemble processes mediating breast cancer progression (Veltmaat et al., 2003Veltmaat J.M.

Mouse embryonic mammogenesis as a model for the molecular regulation of pattern formation.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that stem cells present in fetal mammary rudiments (i.e., fetal mammary stem cells [fMaSCs]) might express genes comprising pathways overlooked by analyses focused only on the adult mammary gland and that fMaSCs may reveal new targets to aide detection, prognosis, and treatment of breast cancers. Consistent with this idea, gene expression profiling of bulk epithelium from early mammogenesis revealed significant differences with the adult epithelium (Wansbury et al., 2011Wansbury O. Mackay A. Kogata N. Mitsopoulos C. Kendrick H. Davidson K. Ruhrberg C. Reis-Filho J.S. Smalley M.J. Zvelebil M. Howard B.A. Transcriptome analysis of embryonic mammary cells reveals insights into mammary lineage establishment.Breast Cancer Res. 2011; 13: R79Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Importantly, this study did not assess whether the profiled cells exhibited stem cell activity, so the relevance of these signatures to fMaSCs remains to be determined. Mouse mammary gland development begins at approximately embryonic day (E)11.5 with a thickening of the ventral ectoderm to generate five pairs of mammary placodes. The placodes become spherical buds by E12.5, which elongate into ductal sprouts in females by E16 (Veltmaat et al., 2003Veltmaat J.M. Mailleux A.A. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mouse embryonic mammogenesis as a model for the molecular regulation of pattern formation.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Invasion of the extending rudiment into the fat pad precursor begins by E16.5, and by E18.5 the mammary rudiment constitutes a primitive branched network within the mammary fat pad (Veltmaat et al., 2003Veltmaat J.M. Mailleux A.A. Thiery J.P. Bellusci S. Mouse embryonic mammogenesis as a model for the molecular regulation of pattern formation.Differentiation. 2003; 71: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Classic rudiment transplantation studies suggest that mammary stem cells may arise coincident with the morphologic specification of the mammary gland (Sakakura et al., 1979Sakakura T. Nishizuka Y. Dawe C.J. Capacity of mammary fat pads of adult C3H/HeMs mice to interact morphogenetically with fetal mammary epithelium.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 63: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For example, transplanting multiple intact E13 to E17 epithelial rudiments generated full mammary outgrowths (Sakakura et al., 1979Sakakura T. Nishizuka Y. Dawe C.J. Capacity of mammary fat pads of adult C3H/HeMs mice to interact morphogenetically with fetal mammary epithelium.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1979; 63: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Heterotypic recombination experiments involving salivary mesenchyme demonstrated that the mammary epithelium is committed to develop into a mammary phenotype by E12.5 (Cunha and Hom, 1996Cunha G.R. Hom Y.K. Role of mesenchymal-epithelial interactions in mammary gland development.J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia. 1996; 1: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we quantify and characterize fMaSC activity during fetal mammogenesis, and analyze the relationships between their gene expression programs and those found in human breast cancer. Our data reveal the unexpected finding that fMaSCs are extremely rare in early embryogenesis but increase rapidly as the mammary rudiment invades into the fat pad precursor. We also show that fMaSCs and their associated stroma exhibit gene expression programs related to those found in specific forms of human breast cancer. We used limiting dilution transplantation analyses (LDTA) to measure mammary repopulating unit (MRU) frequency by using single-hit Poisson statistical analyses (Bonnefoix et al., 1996Bonnefoix T.

Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Accordingly, fetal mammary repopulating units (fMRU) must contain an fMaSC but may additionally require other cells or components for mammary outgrowth. However, as a single stem cell can generate a mammary gland (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E. Generation of a functional mammary gland from a single stem cell.Nature. 2006; 439: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar), we will refer to fMaSC frequency when quantifying fMRUs. We transplanted limiting dilutions of rudiment-derived cell suspensions obtained at different developmental stages of CD1 embryos into immune compromised CB17-SCID recipients (Figure 1A , Table 1, and Table S1, available online) and in parallel transplanted intact mammary rudiments including surrounding mesenchyme (Figures S1A and S1D). Single intact mammary rudiments from as early as E12.5 transplanted at frequencies >70%. In contrast, measurable fMaSC activity was not evident in dissociated bulk mammary cell populations prior to E15.5 (Figure 1A, Table S1D, Table 1, column 2, Table S1, column 3, and Table S2). This was surprising as we transplanted 10,000 viable cells (epithelial and mesenchymal) per fat pad, which is more than we estimate to be present in a single rudiment (Figure 1A, Table 1, and Table S1, column 3). While rudiment dissociation could have reduced repopulation efficiency, especially if contextual cues analogous to niche interactions (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Stem cells find their niche.Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) are required for stem cell function, identically dispersed E18.5 rudiment cells routinely generated mammary outgrowths from 100 cells (Table S1, column 3). Thus, fMaSC concentration increases dramatically during fetal development (Figure 1A; Table 1, column 2, and Table S1, column 3).Table 1Fetal Mammary Rudiments in Late Embryogenesis Are Found to Be Highly Enriched with Mammary Stem CellsBulk Mammary CellsMaSC Frequency (95% CI)No MatrigelCoinjected with MatrigelE13.5ap < 0.001, pairwise group difference.<1/40,0001/12,000 (1/5000 to 1/30,000), p = 0.2E15.5ap < 0.001, pairwise group difference.<1/4,0001/1,800 (1/800 to 1/4,000), p = 0.9E16.5ap < 0.001, pairwise group difference.ND1/200 (1/70 to 1/400), p = 0.68E18.5ap < 0.001, pairwise group difference., bp < 0.001, pairwise group difference.1/830cp < 0.001, pairwise group difference.

The importance of extracellular cues in stem cell function (Spradling et al., 2001Spradling A. Drummond-Barbosa D. Kai T. Stem cells find their niche.Nature. 2001; 414: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) prompted us to determine whether Matrigel would increase fMaSC transplantation efficiency as it does aMaSCs (Lim et al., 2009Lim E. Vaillant F. Wu D. Forrest N.C. Pal B. Hart A.H. Asselin-Labat M.L. Gyorki D.E. Ward T. Partanen A. et al.kConFabAberrant luminal progenitors as the candidate target population for basal tumor development in BRCA1 mutation carriers.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). While Matrigel significantly increased the sensitivity of fMaSC detection, it still equated to one or fewer stem cells per E13.5 rudiment (1/12,000 cells; Figure 1A, Table 1, column 3, and Table S1, column 4). fMaSC activity peaked at E18.5, increasing to 1 in 60 cells with Matrigel, a 14-fold increase compared to transplantation in its absence (Figure 1A, Table 1, and Table S1). Thus, fMaSC concentration increases at least 200-fold between E13.5 to E18.5 when measured in the presence of Matrigel (Figure 1A and Table 1, column 3). This reflects a striking 9-fold increase in fMaSC abundance during the narrow developmental window between E15.5–E16.5 (1 in 1,800 to 1 in 200, p < 0.001) (Figure 1A, Table 1, and Table S1). These quantitative measurements of stem cell frequency during embryogenesis reveal for the first time the surprising finding that transplantable fMaSCs are rare early in mammogenesis but are abundant late. Furthermore, the fMaSC frequency in unfractionated E18.5 embryonic mammary rudiments is ∼5-fold higher than that obtained with bulk adult mammary cell populations measured under identical conditions (1 in 60 versus 1 in 300, p < 0.001) (Table 1 and Table S1). These differences may, in part, reflect different contaminating epithelial and stromal components within the cell populations obtained at different stages. Nevertheless, the data indicate that mammary stem cell frequency is higher in the E18.5 mammary rudiment than in the adult gland. This facilitates their purification for subsequent molecular analyses. aMaSCs can be enriched with fluorescence activated cell sorting for surface markers such as CD24 (heat stable antigen [HSA]) and CD49f (α6 integrin) (Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). Both proteins were expressed in the stromal and epithelial compartments of E13.5 and E15.5 mammary rudiments (Figure 1B). In contrast, high CD24 and CD49f expression at E18.5 identifies a basal-epithelial compartment with negligible staining in the fat pad and surrounding mesenchyme, suggesting the utility of these markers for fMaSC enrichment (Figure 1B). Consistent with this, flow cytometry demonstrated that most E13.5 and E15.5 rudiment cells expressed CD24 and CD49f (Figure S1B). At E18.5, however, these markers delineate a distinct subpopulation comprising approximately 5% of the cells following the exclusion of endothelial and hematopoietic lineages (Figure 1C and Figure S1B). We then compared the CD24 and CD49f staining profiles of admixed and coprocessed eGFP− adult and eGFP+ E18.5 fetal mammary cells (Figure 1C). Cells derived from E18.5 rudiments express higher levels of CD24 than the previously reported CD24medCD49fhigh aMaSC-enriched population and higher levels of CD49f than the CD24highCD49flow adult luminal CFC population (colony-forming cells) (Figure 1C) (Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). This direct comparison with adult mammary cells shows that the fetal population is CD24highCD49fhigh. The CD24highCD49fhigh subpopulation contained all fMaSC activity by transplantation analyses (Figure 1A and Table 1). The remaining fetal population exhibits lower CD24 levels, is devoid of fMaSC activity, and is enriched in stromal cells as defined by cellular morphology and protein and gene expression analyses (see below). Therefore, we call this population the fetal stroma-enriched population (fSTR). As few as five to ten fMaSCs reproducibly enabled robust mammary gland repopulation, while up to 3,000 cells from the fSTR consistently failed to generate outgrowths, even with Matrigel addition (Figure 1A, Table 1, and Table S1). We estimate the stem cell frequency in the fMaSC-enriched population to be 1 in 14 with Matrigel (Table 1, Table S1, and Figure 1A), which is an ∼4-fold enrichment over the aMaSC frequency when immune-compromised hosts were used in the presence of Matrigel (1/50 [aMaSC] versus 1/14 [fMaSC], p < 0.001; Table 1 and Table S1). Importantly, the aMaSC frequency in Matrigel when allotransplantation into immune-compromised hosts was used was similar to that obtained with an immune competent, syngeneic model (C57BL6) in the absence of Matrigel (Tables S1 and S3), and host immune competence did not significantly affect fMaSC frequency in the presence of Matrigel (Table S3). fMaSCs generated morphologically normal, fully arborized ductal structures that produced casein-positive alveolar structures upon induction of pregnancy (Figure 1D). Mammary outgrowths exhibited the expected localized expression of luminal and myoepithelial keratins (K8 and K14, respectively) (Figure 1D), the phenotypic cellular heterogeneity of wild-type adult mammary glands (Figure 1E), and contained cells able to self-renew based on serial transplantation analyses (Figure 1F). Thus, the fMaSC-enriched population exhibits the multi-lineage cell differentiation and self-renewal characteristics expected of mammary stem cells, but at considerably higher concentration than found in the adult (Shackleton et al., 2006Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Simpson K.J. Stingl J. Smyth G.K. Asselin-Labat M.L. Wu L. Lindeman G.J. Visvader J.E.

Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). We evaluated the ability of individual fMaSCs to generate multiple lineages in vitro (Dontu et al., 2003Dontu G. Al-Hajj M. Abdallah W.M. Clarke M.F. Wicha M.S. Stem cells in normal breast development and breast cancer.Cell Prolif. 2003; 36: 59-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). While fMaSCs had negligible sphere-forming efficiency (SFE) with a conventional nonadherent sphere-forming protocol at low seeding density (1,000 cells per cm2) (SFE ∼0.1%; Figures 2A and 2B ), fSTR formed numerous spherical clusters under identical conditions (SFE = 1.4%) (Figures 2A and 2B). However, just as Matrigel profoundly increased transplantation efficiency, even low percentages of Matrigel (2%) enabled the fMaSC population to generate spheres with an SFE of 9.4% when plated at low density (Figures 2A and 2B). The primary fMaSC-derived spheres were morphologically similar to the colonies previously reported for the aMaSC population (Figure 2A) (Stingl et al., 2006Stingl J. Eirew P. Ricketson I. Shackleton M. Vaillant F. Choi D. Li H.I. Eaves C.J. Purification and unique properties of mammary epithelial stem cells.Nature. 2006; 439: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). In addition, fMaSC-derived primary spheres expressed markers associated with both myoepithelial (e.g., cytokeratin 14 [K14]) and luminal (cytokeratin 8 [K8]) epithelial lineages of the mammary gland (Figure 2C). We used two independent strategies to determine whether primary spheres arise from clonal expansion from a single cell or from cell aggregation. First, we seeded single cells from the fMaSC population into individual wells. Primary spheres formed (SFE = 10.7%) in 2% Matrigel, similar to the 9.4% SFE observed when the cells were plated at low density (Figure 2B and Figure S2A). Secondary and tertiary spheres were also formed with similar SFEs (∼10%; Figure 2B). The fSTR did not generate spheres in the presence of Matrigel and instead produced cultures of dispersed cells resembling fibroblasts and neurons (Figures 2Aii and 2B). Second, we mixed single-cell suspensions of eGFP+ and eGFP− cells from the fMaSC population and then grew them at low density (Figure 2B and Figure S2B). As 199 out of 200 spheres were a single color, the vast"

It has been shown previously that regulation of cell volume, in particular as it relates to ionic homeostasis, is crucially involved in the activation/inactivation of the cell death processes. We thus present here an application of digital holographic microscopy (DHM) dedicated to early and label-free detection of cell death. Methods and Findings We provide quantitative measurements of phase signal obtained on mouse cortical neurons, and caused by early neuronal cell volume regulation triggered by excitotoxic concentrations of L-glutamate. We show that the efficiency of this early regulation of cell volume detected by DHM, is correlated with the occurrence of subsequent neuronal death assessed with the widely accepted trypan blue method for detection of cell viability. Conclusions The determination of the phase signal by DHM provides a simple and rapid optical method for the early detection of cell death."

In order to facilitate the diagnosis of IBD and assess its disease activity, we investigated the potential of novel multivariate indexes using statistical modeling of plasma amino acid concentrations (aminogram).We measured fasting plasma aminograms in 387 IBD patients (Crohn's disease (CD), n = 165; ulcerative colitis (UC), n = 222) and 210 healthy controls. Based on Fisher linear classifiers, multivariate indexes were developed from the aminogram in discovery samples (CD, n = 102; UC, n = 102; age and sex-matched healthy controls, n = 102) and internally validated. The indexes were used to discriminate between CD or UC patients and healthy controls, as well as between patients with active disease and those in remission. We assessed index performances using the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC). We observed significant alterations to the plasma aminogram, including histidine and tryptophan. The multivariate indexes established from plasma aminograms were able to distinguish CD or UC patients from healthy controls with ROC AUCs of 0.940 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.898-0.983) and 0.894 (95%CI: 0.853-0.935), respectively in validation samples (CD, n = 63; UC, n = 120; healthy controls, n = 108). In addition, other indexes appeared to be a measure of disease activity. These indexes distinguished active CD or UC patients from each remission patients with ROC AUCs of 0.894 (95%CI: 0.853-0.935) and 0.849 (95%CI: 0.770-0.928), and correlated with clinical disease activity indexes for CD (r(s) = 0.592, 95%CI: 0.385-0.742, p<0.001) or UC (r(s) = 0.598, 95%CI: 0.452-0.713, p<0.001), respectively.In this study, we demonstrated that established multivariate indexes composed of plasma amino acid profiles can serve as novel, non-invasive, objective biomarkers for the diagnosis and monitoring of IBD, providing us with new insights into the pathophysiology of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063399102,"Extrinsic BMP and LIF signaling collaboratively maintain mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency, whereas appropriate ERK activity is essential for ESC fate commitment. However, how the extrinsic signals restrain appropriate ERK activity remains elusive. Here, we show that, whereas LIF sustains relatively high ERK activity, BMP4 can steadily attenuate ERK activity by upregulating ERK-specific dual-specificity phosphatase 9 (DUSP9). This upregulation requires Smad1/5 and Smad4 and specifically occurs to DUSP9, but not other DUSPs, and only in ESCs. Through DUSP9-mediated inhibition of ERK activity, BMP signaling reinforces the self-renewal status of mouse ESCs together with LIF. Upon LIF withdrawal, ESCs spontaneously undergo neural differentiation, during which process DUSP9 can partially mediate BMP inhibition on neural commitment. Collectively, our findings identify DUSP9 as a critical mediator of BMP signaling to control appropriate ERK activity critical for ESC fate determination."
https://openalex.org/W2151153178,"Intestinal crypts in mammals are comprised of long-lived stem cells and shorter-lived progenies. These two populations are maintained in specific proportions during adult life. Here, we investigate the design principles governing the dynamics of these proportions during crypt morphogenesis. Using optimal control theory, we show that a proliferation strategy known as a ""bang-bang"" control minimizes the time to obtain a mature crypt. This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other developmental systems."

Ephrin-A receptors are thought to depend on transmembrane coreceptors for transmitting signals intracellularly. We show that the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret is required for motor axon attraction mediated by ephrin-A reverse signaling. Ret also mediates GPI-anchored GFRα1 signaling in response to GDNF, a diffusible chemoattractant in the limb, indicating that Ret is a multifunctional coreceptor for guidance molecules. Axons respond synergistically to coactivation by GDNF and EphA ligands, and these cooperative interactions are gated by GFRα1 levels. Our studies uncover a hierarchical GPI-receptor signaling network that is constructed from combinatorial components and integrated through Ret using ligand coincidence detection."
https://openalex.org/W1979133578,"Although molecular components of the circadian clock are known, mechanisms that transmit signals from the clock and produce rhythmic behavior are poorly understood. We find that the microRNA miR-279 regulates the JAK/STAT pathway to drive rest:activity rhythms in Drosophila. Overexpression of microRNA miR-279 or miR-279 deletion attenuates rest:activity rhythms. Oscillations of the clock protein PERIOD are normal in pacemaker neurons lacking miR-279, suggesting that miR-279 acts downstream of the clock. We identify the JAK/STAT ligand, Upd, as a target of miR-279 and show that knockdown of Upd rescues the behavioral phenotype of miR-279 mutants. Manipulations of the JAK/STAT pathway also disrupt circadian rhythms. In addition, central clock neurons project in the vicinity of Upd-expressing neurons, providing a possible physical connection by which the central clock could regulate JAK/STAT signaling to control rest:activity rhythms."

Recently, it has emerged that the HSC compartment and their more short-lived multipotent progeny (collectively termed hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells [HSPCs]) can directly react to inflammatory stress by proliferating and differentiating into the required cellular progeny (Baldridge et al., 2011Baldridge M.T.

During infection, consumption of neutrophils drives a demand-driven granulopoietic response within the bone marrow to facilitate their replenishment, often at the expense of other blood lineages (Panopoulos and Watowich, 2008Panopoulos A.D.

This hematopoietic response also involves reactive proliferation/expansion of the HSPC compartment (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C.

Examining blood development in the context of inflammation and infection has resulted in the discovery of a number of immune mediators that drive demand-driven granulopoiesis and influence HSPC function (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T.

Well-characterized proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IFN-γ have been demonstrated to directly influence HSCs as part of a feedback loop, in response to depleted differentiated progeny (Baldridge et al., 2010Baldridge M.T. King K.Y. Boles N.C. Weksberg D.C.

Immunol. 2008; 180: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF/CSF3) and its receptor G-CSFR/CSF3R are essential for both steady-state and stress-induced granulopoiesis (Panopoulos and Watowich, 2008Panopoulos A.D. Watowich S.S. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor: molecular mechanisms of action during steady state and ‘emergency’ hematopoiesis.Cytokine. 2008; 42: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This granulopoiesis-promoting activity of G-CSF in response to infection is driven by the CCAAT enhancer binding protein, C/EBPβ (Hirai et al., 2006Hirai H. Zhang P. Dayaram T. Hetherington C.J. Mizuno S. Imanishi J. Akashi K. Tenen D.G. C/EBPbeta is required for ‘emergency’ granulopoiesis.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2010Zhang H.

Signaling components that help regulate demand-driven neutrophil production, downstream of C/EBPβ, remain unknown. In zebrafish (Danio rerio) the first bona fide HSCs emerge from hemogenic endothelial cells lining the ventral dorsal aorta (DA) from ∼30 hr post fertilization (hpf). These endothelial cell-derived nascent HSCs transiently occupy the subaortic mesenchyme, a site analogous to the mammalian aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, where they have been observed to undergo limited (i.e. a single), presumably symmetric cell division (Bertrand et al., 2010Bertrand J.Y. Chi N.C. Santoso B. Teng S. Stainier D.Y. Traver D. Haematopoietic stem cells derive directly from aortic endothelium during development.Nature. 2010; 464: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Kissa and Herbomel, 2010Kissa K.

Live imaging of Runx1 expression in the dorsal aorta tracks the emergence of blood progenitors from endothelial cells.Blood. 2010; 116: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These blood progenitors are believed to maintain an HSC identity as they enter the circulation through the underlying cardinal vein and home to the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) where they proliferate/differentiate before engrafting the definitive hematopoietic organs, the thymus and kidney (Murayama et al., 2006Murayama E. Kissa K. Zapata A. Mordelet E. Briolat V. Lin H.F. Handin R.I. Herbomel P. Tracing hematopoietic precursor migration to successive hematopoietic organs during zebrafish development.Immunity. 2006; 25: 963-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Lineage tracing experiments suggest HSCs are only specified during this developmental window and no longer emerge de novo at later stages of development (Bertrand et al., 2010Bertrand J.Y. Chi N.C. Santoso B. Teng S. Stainier D.Y. Traver D. Haematopoietic stem cells derive directly from aortic endothelium during development.Nature. 2010; 464: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). Employing a larval zebrafish model of demand-driven granulopoiesis to examine HSPC development through the “lens of infection,” we provide new insight into how inflammatory stress “fine-tunes” hematopoiesis. We show that the zebrafish larval hematopoietic system responds to infection through the reactive expansion of the HSPC compartment. Further examination revealed a previously unappreciated role for C/ebpβ-dependent Nos2a-generated nitric oxide (NO) during HSPC and neutrophil-fated progenitor expansion following infection. These results provide new mechanistic insight into how the HSPC compartment responds to inflammatory stress. Prior to investigating the effect of infection on HSPCs, we examined whether larval hematopoiesis was responsive to infection. To address whether zebrafish replenish neutrophils lost as a result of cell death or apoptosis following infection, neutrophil abundance within Tg(lyz:DsRED) larvae (a transgenic reporter line that specifically marks neutrophils) was quantified throughout the course of infection. To facilitate direct observation of bacterial burden, a GFP-expressing Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (hereafter referred to as Sal-GFP) was selected (Hall et al., 2007Hall C. Flores M.V. Storm T. Crosier K. Crosier P. The zebrafish lysozyme C promoter drives myeloid-specific expression in transgenic fish.BMC Dev. Biol. 2007; 7: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Time-lapse imaging following injection of Sal-GFP into the hindbrain ventricle of Tg(lyz:DsRED) larvae at 50 hpf (Figure 1A ) revealed robust recruitment of neutrophils to the midbrain and hindbrain. Highly motile neutrophils were observed phagocytosing the injected bacteria as part of an immediate innate immune response (Figure S1 and Movie S1, available online). One day following bacterial injection (1 dpi Infected), larvae demonstrated one of four phenotypes when compared with PBS-injected controls (1 dpi PBS). Infected larvae were: dead; overwhelmed by infection (such larvae never survived to 2 dpi and were always removed from further analysis); possessing numbers of neutrophils similar to uninjected controls that were dispersed throughout larval tissues (often with low levels of bacterial burden remaining in the head); or demonstrating a marked reduction in neutrophil numbers with very little or no detectable bacterial burden (Figure S1; see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Flow cytometry analysis revealing surviving larvae that possessed reduced neutrophil numbers at 1 dpi demonstrated a marked increase in whole-larvae neutrophil numbers that peaked at 2 dpi before gradually returning to steady-state levels, when compared with PBS controls (Figure 1B). We next examined whether this neutrophil expansion was the result of enhanced granulopoiesis within larval hematopoietic sites. Live imaging of infected larvae that possessed an almost complete loss of neutrophils by 1 dpi revealed de novo emergence of neutrophils within the AGM and CHT regions from 1.25–1.5 dpi that was most evident at 2 dpi (Figures 1C and 1D). All further assessment of infection on hematopoiesis focused on the AGM region (a region only sparsely populated with neutrophils under steady-state conditions) due to the confounding influence of steady-state granulopoiesis within the CHT. Throughout the remainder of this study (unless otherwise stated), an optimized infection dose of between 400 and 600 colony-forming units (cfu) was injected into the hindbrain ventricle at 50 hpf. This gave a sufficient proportion of larvae demonstrating neutrophil depletion at 1 dpi and subsequent demand-driven granulopoiesis, as scored within the AGM region at 2 dpi (∼55% to 60% of surviving larvae), with survival of ∼85% to 90% (Figure S1). Unless otherwise stated, data presented throughout the remainder of this study as “Infected” refers to this surviving cohort. In support of our live imaging studies, quantitative-(Q)PCR analysis of the neutrophil-specific (lyz and mpx), pan-myeloid (lcp1), and myeloid progenitor (spi1) genes following infection demonstrated a peak in expression at ∼2 dpi (Figure S1) (Lieschke et al., 2002Lieschke G.J. Oates A.C. Paw B.H. Thompson M.A. Hall N.E. Ward A.C. Ho R.K. Zon L.I. Layton J.E.

Immunol. 2008; 32: 36-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The macrophage-specific marker csf1ra also increased following infection, suggesting that demand-driven hematopoiesis may not be exclusively granulopoietic. To assess whether infection also resulted in expansion of the macrophage lineage, which shares a common spi1-expressing progenitor with neutrophils, we examined whether the macrophage-lineage marker mpeg1 was also expressed by cells within the AGM following infection (Ellett et al., 2011Ellett F. Pase L. Hayman J.W. Andrianopoulos A. Lieschke G.J. mpeg1 promoter transgenes direct macrophage-lineage expression in zebrafish.Blood. 2011; 117: e49-e56Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). Although large numbers of macrophages were detected within the infection site, consistent with the later timing of macrophage infiltration during inflammation, no expression of mpeg1 was observed within the AGM region (Figure 1E). This was in contrast to spi1 expression, which strongly marked myeloid progenitors within this domain (Figure 1E). Expression analysis confirmed that these spi1-expressing progenitor cells were fated to the neutrophil lineage, as evidenced by lyz coexpression (Figure 1F). To investigate whether demand-driven granulopoiesis influenced the development of the lymphoid lineage, we examined expression of the transcription factor ikaros, which typically marks lymphoid progenitors within the AGM, following infection at 2 dpi (Murayama et al., 2006Murayama E. Kissa K. Zapata A. Mordelet E. Briolat V. Lin H.F. Handin R.I. Herbomel P. Tracing hematopoietic precursor migration to successive hematopoietic organs during zebrafish development.Immunity. 2006; 25: 963-975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, Willett et al., 2001Willett C.E. Kawasaki H. Amemiya C.T. Lin S. Steiner L.A. Ikaros expression as a marker for lymphoid progenitors during zebrafish development.Dev. Dyn. 2001; 222: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Figure S1). Quantifying the number of somite boundaries within the AGM region containing ikaros+ cells revealed a significant decrease in ikaros expression following infection (Figure S1). To examine if this decrease in ikaros expression resulted in a decrease in thymus-resident T cell precursors, we assessed the abundance of lck-expressing thymocytes within infected double transgenic Tg(lck:GFP)/Tg(lyz:DsRED) larvae at 3, 4, and 5 dpi, compared with PBS controls (Figure S1). Coincident with initiation of demand-driven granulopoiesis within the AGM and consistent with a decrease in ikaros expression, a marked decrease in lck:GFP-expressing thymocytes was observed following infection. These results demonstrate that the larval zebrafish hematopoietic system can respond to infection by specifically enhancing the production of neutrophils, at the expense of other blood lineages. To demonstrate that demand-driven granulopoiesis within the AGM was dependent upon definitive hematopoiesis (and by association resident HSPCs), we assessed the ability of Runx1-depleted embryos to replenish neutrophil numbers following infection. Runx1 is a transcription factor that in zebrafish, as in mammals, is absolutely required for HSPC development and definitive hematopoiesis (Lam et al., 2009Lam E.Y. Chau J.Y. Kalev-Zylinska M.L. Fountaine T.M. Mead R.S. Hall C.J. Crosier P.S. Crosier K.E. Flores M.V. Zebrafish runx1 promoter-EGFP transgenics mark discrete sites of definitive blood progenitors.Blood. 2009; 113: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have shown that HSPC ontogeny, including their emergence within the subaortic mesenchyme of the AGM, can be observed within Tg(runx1P2:EGFP) embryos (Lam et al., 2010Lam E.Y. Hall C.J. Crosier P.S. Crosier K.E. Flores M.V. Live imaging of Runx1 expression in the dorsal aorta tracks the emergence of blood progenitors from endothelial cells.Blood. 2010; 116: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated depletion of Runx1 led to an almost complete absence of HSPCs within the AGM, decreased survival postinfection, and reduced steady-state granulopoiesis (Figure S2). Live imaging of double transgenic Tg(lyz:DsRED)/Tg(runx1P2:EGFP) larvae following infection revealed that Runx1/HSPC-depleted larvae did not initiate demand-driven granulopoiesis (Figure 2A ). This suggested that demand-driven production of neutrophil-fated progenitors within the AGM develops by in situ differentiation from resident HSPCs. Of note, live imaging of infected Tg(runx1P2:EGFP) larvae revealed an increase in fluorescently marked HSPCs within the AGM following infection, a result supported by QPCR analysis of runx1 expression (Figure S2) and validated by quantification of cmyb-expressing HSPCs within the AGM following infection (Figures 2B and 2C). In mammals, although enriched in HSPCs, c-myb is also expressed within more committed blood cells (Kastan et al., 1989Kastan M.B. Slamon D.J. Civin C.I. Expression of protooncogene c-myb in normal human hematopoietic cells.Blood. 1989; 73: 1444-1451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In zebrafish, the earliest cells classified as HSCs are those that have directly differentiated from hemogenic endothelial cells (endothelial cells possessing hematopoietic potential) that line the ventral wall of the DA. Nascent HSCs then transiently occupy the subaortic mesenchyme between the main trunk vessels (Bertrand et al., 2010Bertrand J.Y. Chi N.C. Santoso B. Teng S. Stainier D.Y. Traver D. Haematopoietic stem cells derive directly from aortic endothelium during development.Nature. 2010; 464: 108-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, Kissa and Herbomel, 2010Kissa K. Herbomel P. Blood stem cells emerge from aortic endothelium by a novel type of cell transition.Nature. 2010; 464: 112-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that subaortic runx1-expressing HSCs directly emerge from similarly runx1-expressing endothelial cells lining the ventral DA within compound Tg(runx1P2:EGFP)/Tg(kdrl:nls-mCherry) embryos (where the kdrl:nls-mCherry transgene marks endothelial nuclei with red fluorescence; Lam et al., 2010Lam E.Y. Hall C.J. Crosier P.S. Crosier K.E. Flores M.V. Live imaging of Runx1 expression in the dorsal aorta tracks the emergence of blood progenitors from endothelial cells.Blood. 2010; 116: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Due to experimental limitations it is not possible to confirm whether all newly emerged progenitors maintain an HSC identity during their occupation of the subaortic mesenchyme and entry into the underlying vein. In light of this, we hereafter refer to these endothelial cell-derived subaortic kdrl+runx1+ blood progenitors (as marked within compound Tg(runx1P2:EGFP)/Tg(kdrl:nls-mCherry) larvae) as HSPCs. To confirm the effect of infection on the HSPC compartment, we quantified the number of dual fluorescent HSPCs within the subaortic region of infected Tg(runx1P2:EGFP)/Tg(kdrl:nls-mCherry) larvae, relative to PBS controls. This revealed an increase in HSPCs within the subaortic mesenchyme that could be detected by 1 dpi, immediately preceding the detection of lyz-expressing cells (Figure 2D). Of note, there was no difference in the number of kdrl+runx1+ endothelial cells between PBS control and infected larvae (Figure S2). This suggests that the increase in HSPC numbers following infection is not the result of an increase in kdrl+runx1+ endothelial cell numbers that subsequently bud to produce HSPCs. Infection-responsive HSPC expansion is most likely the result of enhanced proliferation of HSPCs within the subaortic mesenchyme following their endothelial to HSPC transition. These results confirm that demand-driven granulopoiesis involves the infection-responsive expansion of HSPCs that contribute to the neutrophil lineage. During infection, myelopoiesis-promoting cytokines are believed to reach the bone marrow hematopoietic niche via the circulation to influence blood progenitor fate. G-CSF and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF/CSF1) are the two predominant lineage-specific cytokines that drive neutrophil and macrophage production, respectively (Kaushansky, 2006Kaushansky K. Lineage-specific hematopoietic growth factors.N. Engl. J. Med. 2006; 354: 2034-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, Motoyoshi, 1998Motoyoshi K. Biological activities and clinical application of M-CSF.Int. J. Hematol. 1998; 67: 109-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). QPCR expression analysis of csf1a, csf1b, and gcsf transcripts following infection revealed that only gcsf demonstrated a significant elevation in expression that was coincident with demand-driven granulopoiesis (Figure S3). Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH) analysis of gcsf revealed this expression to be restricted to the infection site (midbrain and hindbrain) while transcripts for its receptor, gcsfr, were detected within cells throughout the AGM compartment (Figures 3A and 3B ). Given the lack of obvious gcsfr expression within HSPCs in the AGM region of control larvae, this elevated expression following infection is most likely a combination of enhanced expression within an expanded pool of HSPCs. Expression analysis revealed that all lyz-expressing neutrophils did not express gcsf, while all gcsf-expressing cells were positive for the pan-leukocyte marker lcp-1 (Figures 3C and 3D). Furthermore, gcsf-expressing cells were not positive for the microglial marker apolipoprotein Eb (apoeb) (Figure 3E). The lyz−lcp1+apoeb− phenotype is consistent with these gcsf-expressing cells being macrophages. To address the requirement for Gcsf/Gcsfr signaling during demand-driven granulopoiesis, we infected Gcsfr-depleted double transgenic Tg(lyz:EGFP)/Tg(gata1:DsRED) larvae and assessed their ability to replenish neutrophils. Gcsfr-depleted larvae possessed fewer neutrophils and demonstrated reduced survival following infection when compared to control MO-injected siblings (Figure S3). Of note, Gcsfr-depleted larvae were more susceptible to infection than Runx1-depleted larvae, despite maintaining similar numbers of neutrophils at the time of infection. This suggests that the increased susceptibility to infection following Gcsfr depletion is largely the result of defective Gcsf/Gcsfr-mediated neutrophil function/maturation rather than reduced neutrophil numbers. This high susceptibility to infection following Gcsfr depletion precluded assessment of subsequent demand-driven granulopoiesis. To circumvent this, we injected nonlethal heat-shocked Sal-GFP, which, despite not depleting neutrophil numbers by 1 dpi, could still elicit a demand-driven granulopoietic response by 2 dpi, although not within Gcsfr-depleted larvae (Figure 3F and Figure S3). These results confirm that Gcsf signaling is necessary for demand-driven expansion of gcsfr-expressing HSPCs within the AGM compartment. Of note, given that heat-killed bacteria maintained the capacity to initiate demand-driven granulopoiesis independent of the neutrophil depletion following live infection, neutrophil apoptosis appears to be dispensable for demand-driven granulopoiesis. In mice, G-CSF-dependant demand-driven granulopoiesis is in part regulated by the downstream transcription factor C/EBPβ (Hirai et al., 2006Hirai H. Zhang P. Dayaram T. Hetherington C.J. Mizuno S. Imanishi J. Akashi K. Tenen D.G. C/EBPbeta is required for ‘emergency’ granulopoiesis.Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 732-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2010Zhang H. Nguyen-Jackson H. Panopoulos A.D. Li H.S. Murray P.J. Watowich S.S. STAT3 controls myeloid progenitor growth during emergency granulopoiesis.Blood. 2010; 116: 2462-2471Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). A function for zebrafish C/ebpβ during hematopoiesis has not been reported. QPCR analysis of cebpβ expression revealed significant increases in expression coincident with the timing of demand-driven granulopoiesis (Figure S4). At both 12 hr postinfection (hpi) (prior to the demand-driven production of lyz-expressing cells) and 2 dpi, cells expressing cebpβ were detected within the AGM following infection (Figure 4A ). Expression analysis revealed these earliest cebpβ-expressing cells in the AGM to be runx1+ HSPCs, while later expression also included newly emerging lyz+ neutrophil-fated progenitors (Figures 4B and 4C). Flow cytometry quantification of fluorescent neutrophils within C/ebpβ-depleted Tg(lyz:DsRED) embryos and larvae confirmed that this transcription factor, as in mammals, is dispensable for maintaining steady-state neutrophil numbers (Figure S4). This was in contrast to the situation following infection, where C/ebpβ MO-injected larvae were not able to replenish depleted neutrophil numbers, as demonstrated within double transgenic Tg(lyz:EGFP)/Tg(gata1:DsRED) larvae (Figure 4D). These results strongly suggest that the transcription factor C/ebpβ, although dispensable for steady-state neutrophil production, is required within HSPCs and neutrophil-fated progenitors for their proliferation and/or differentiation into neutrophils during demand-driven granulopoiesis. Downstream targets of C/EBPβ that promote demand-driven granulopoiesis following infection remain unknown. Predicted targets would be C/EBPβ responsive, demonstrate the potential to be modulated following immune stimulation, have the ability to influence hematopoiesis, and suppress apoptotic signals and/or enhance cell proliferation. These criteria led us to investigate a potential role for the cytokine-inducible form of NO (produced by NOS2/INOS), a well-characterized regulator of diverse inflammatory responses (Korhonen et al., 2005Korhonen R.

https://openalex.org/W2070986661,"The primary motor cortex (M1) is the main effector structure implicated in the generation of voluntary movements and is directly involved in motor learning. The intrinsic horizontal neuronal connections of M1 exhibit short-term and long-term plasticity, which is a strong substrate for learning-related map reorganization. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) applied for few minutes over M1 has been shown to induce relatively long-lasting plastic alterations and to modulate motor performance. Here we test the hypothesis that the relatively long-lasting synaptic modification induced by tDCS over M1 results in the alteration of associations among populations of M1 neurons which may be reflected in changes of its functional architecture. fMRI resting-state datasets were acquired immediately before and after 10 minutes of tDCS during rest, with the anode/cathode placed over the left M1. For each functional dataset, grey-matter voxels belonging to Brodmann area 4 (BA4) were labelled and afterwards BA4 voxel-based synchronization matrices were calculated and thresholded to construct undirected graphs. Nodal network parameters which characterize the architecture of functional networks (connectivity degree, clustering coefficient and characteristic path-length) were computed, transformed to volume maps and compared before and after stimulation. At the dorsolateral-BA4 region cathodal tDCS boosted local connectedness, while anodal-tDCS enhanced long distance functional communication within M1. Additionally, the more efficient the functional architecture of M1 was at baseline, the more efficient the tDCS-induced functional modulations were. In summary, we show here that it is possible to non-invasively reorganize the intrinsic functional architecture of M1, and to image such alterations."

Arf is also required with coatomer-related clathrin adaptor complexes to bud vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and endosomal compartments. To understand the structural basis for Arf-dependent recruitment of a vesicular coat to the membrane, we determined the structure of Arf1 bound to the γζ-COP subcomplex of coatomer. Structure-guided biochemical analysis reveals that a second Arf1-GTP molecule binds to βδ-COP at a site common to the γ- and β-COP subunits. The Arf1-binding sites on coatomer are spatially related to PtdIns4,5P(2)-binding sites on the endocytic AP2 complex, providing evidence that the orientation of membrane binding is general for this class of vesicular coat proteins. A bivalent GTP-dependent binding mode has implications for the dynamics of coatomer interaction with the Golgi and for the selection of cargo molecules."

We discuss here the challenges and potential for the translation of stem-cell-based approaches into treatments for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Stem cells and their derivatives show tremendous potential for treating many disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss here the challenges and potential for the translation of stem-cell-based approaches into treatments for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. “Neurodegenerative disease” is a term used for a wide range of acute and chronic conditions in which neurons in the brain and spinal cord die. In these disorders, there is a core loss of cells with a secondary population of “at risk” cells that may succumb to the ongoing disease process, possibly driven or exacerbated by a local inflammatory response. Stem-cell-based therapies could potentially be beneficial by acting though several mechanisms:cell replacement, where transplants of cells are given to directly replace those that are lost;trophic support, where the cells are used to promote survival of affected neurons and endogenous repair of the diseased brain areas;modulation of inflammation, which may be involved in the disease process. Any stem-cell-based approach for treating a neurodegenerative disorder must be proven to work through one or more of these mechanisms. No application in patients can be justified on the basis that there is no alternative effective therapy if that new experimental treatment has neither proven efficacy in the laboratory nor any evidence to show a mechanism of action. Trials showing safety alone without any scientific grounds for their use are unethical. Here, we discuss the clinical translation of stem cells in the treatment of three neurodegenerative disorders: Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Whereas many motor features respond rather well to dopaminergic medication and deep brain stimulation, effective therapies for the nonmotor symptoms, such as dementia, are lacking, and the progression of the disease is not slowed by available treatments. In experimental clinical trials, transplants of human fetal ventral mesencephalic tissue (containing developing nigral dopaminergic cells) can produce dramatic motor improvements in some patients. Stem cell transplants should be able to, in theory, help patients with PD by either replacing the dopaminergic neurons or restoring and maintaining the integrity of the nigrostriatal pathway through the release of trophic factors. Stem cells can only be said to be curative if they (1) differentiate into appropriate midbrain dopaminergic neurons and (2) integrate and send axons into areas with dopaminergic axon and synapse loss. No uncontrolled cell proliferation should occur, as this would pose a tumor risk. Based on the available data, stem cells have the potential to help restore or preserve striatal dopaminergic innervation; however, there are few cell differentiation protocols that enable derivation of human dopaminergic neurons with an authentic midbrain phenotype. HD is an autosomal dominant disease that causes cellular dysfunction and loss at numerous central nervous system (CNS) sites including the striatum. The disease is fatal and is characterized by chorea, psychiatric problems, and progressive dementia. There is currently no effective treatment. Reparative strategies for HD using cell replacement or trophic factor support have concentrated on the striatum. Preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates have suggested that intra-striatal transplants of fetal striatal tissue may have restorative effects. While the clinical translation of these studies in small Phase I trials has not resulted in the types of dramatic improvements as seen for PD, there are some early data suggesting that intra-striatal implants of human fetal striatal allografts can ameliorate some aspects of the disease. More preclinical work remains to be done, and the final outcome of the already-initiated human transplant studies needs to be assessed before considering additional clinical trials for HD. With regard to stem cell transplants, there is some evidence that neural progenitor cells can ameliorate functional deficits in animal models of HD, perhaps through the generation of astrocyte support cells and the release of growth factors. ALS causes the dysfunction and degeneration of motor neurons in the spinal cord, cerebral cortex, and brainstem, leading to rapidly progressing muscle weakness and death within a few years of onset. No effective treatment exists. To date, there is no proof-of-concept study demonstrating that cell therapy can reduce the symptoms or extend life in people affected with ALS. The most discussed use of stem cells is to replace dying motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. However, there are major technical hurdles to overcome including the delivery of cells to all of these sites and the requirement of axonal growth over long distances to the muscles. Because glial cells may also contribute to the pathology in ALS, leading to a secondary loss of neurons, a more practical approach may be to provide stem-cell-derived astrocytes to degenerating regions to protect dying motor neurons. Combining these approaches with the delivery of growth factors may lead to further neuroprotection. However, the progression of motor neuron diseases may also be driven by inflammatory cascades, and the careful consideration of how such processes may influence the survival of transplanted cells and the outcome of neuroprotective approaches is needed. Animal models of PD concentrate on lesions of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway (e.g., by 6-hydroxydopamine, MPTP, and rotenone) and studies of sensorimotor functions. While this is a useful starting point, these models do not imitate the clinical disorder, which has many nonmotor and motor features with nondopaminergic, extranigral pathologies. Nevertheless, these dopaminergic lesion models are useful in evaluating the utility of dopaminergic therapies such as stem cell grafts. Attempts to develop transgenic models of PD have been pursued in recent years, but these also represent useful but partial models of the core pathologies. The fact that HD is fully transmitted through a family gene mutation has allowed transgenic models to be developed. Several mouse models of HD exist, but overall cell loss is limited, and thus the use of transgenic mice for neuronal replacement has met with limited success. However, all current transgenic HD models can serve, to an extent, as experimental paradigms for studying the possible trophic actions of stem cells, and a delay in disease-like signs in these models would serve as a useful outcome measure. For the replacement of cells or neurons lost in the HD circuitry, excitotoxic/metabolic models likely serve as more direct tests of the restorative potential of cell grafts. The primary animal model of ALS involves the overexpression of mutated superoxide dismutase gene one (SOD1). Mice, rats, or pigs expressing this mutation show no phenotype until young adult ages are reached, at which time motor neurons gradually die in the ventral spinal cord, leading to paralysis and death. This progression is accompanied by inflammation. While very accurately portraying the motor neuron loss seen in patients with an SOD1 mutation, it is unclear how this model relates to cases of the much more common sporadic ALS, in which the SOD1 gene is unaffected. Clinical trials using stem cells or their derivatives have not been performed thus far for PD or HD. Following the intra-striatal transplantation of human fetal mesencephalic tissue, which is rich in dopaminergic neuroblasts, the dopaminergic neurons that form from the transplanted tissue reinnervate the denervated striatum and become functionally integrated, restoring striatal dopamine release and, for some PD patients, giving rise to clear clinical improvement for over a decade. A subgroup of transplanted patients developed troublesome involuntary movements (dyskinesias), probably due to graft-derived striatal serotonergic hyperinnervation or uneven distribution of the grafts across the striatal complex. Grafts of human fetal striatal tissue placed in the striatum of patients with mild HD have, in some cases, given rise to long-term functional benefit for both motor and cognitive features. Hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells have both been delivered to ALS patients to alter the inflammatory environment and were reported to provide either no or some clinical benefit. However, the preclinical data regarding safety, dosage, long-term survival, differentiation, and functional efficacy are insufficient, and without a control group, the clinical evidence of improvement is weak. It is important to note, however, that no serious side effects were observed after injecting cells into the spinal cord of ALS patients. More preclinical studies are needed prior to further patient applications. Recently, neural stem cells that were expanded from human fetal spinal cord tissue were transplanted into the spinal cord of ALS patients as part of a new FDA-approved Phase I trial. The rationale for this study is not motor neuron or astrocyte replacement. Rather, the new cells may form interneurons, which might affect motor neuron output through poorly understood presynaptic mechanisms and perhaps release growth factors to protect the remaining motor neurons. For PD, cells with the properties of dopaminergic neuroblasts have been generated in vitro for preclinical transplantation from stem cells of several different sources and species, including humans. For example, they have been derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs), therapeutically cloned ESCs, neural stem cells (NSCs) and progenitors from the embryonic ventral mesencephalon, adult NSCs from the subventricular zone, and fibroblast-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The yield of dopaminergic neuroblasts with the correct substantia nigra phenotype can be increased by improved differentiation protocols that utilize specific transcription factors that determine mesencephalic dopaminergic neuron specification or maturation during normal development. For HD, attempts to generate striatal cells for transplantation from NSCs expanded in vitro face a challenge in that prolonged propagation in the presence of growth factors may impair the maintenance of a proper regional phenotype. Recently, a multistep protocol was established that permits the generation of striatal neurons from human ESCs. Upon transplantation into quinolinic acid-lesioned rats, these cells differentiated into DARPP32+ neurons and extended axons into the host fiber tracts. However, despite the fact that the cells were committed to a neural lineage, the grafts exhibited massive proliferation, resulting in overgrowth, indicating the necessity for a better control of donor cell differentiation after transplantation. Motor neurons and astrocytes, which are potentially useful for preclinical applications for ALS, have been generated in vitro from mouse and human ESCs and iPSCs and from human fetal brain tissue. In one study, stem-cell-derived motor neuron precursors and neuroblasts established functional synapses with muscle fibers in vitro and, in a few cases, extended axons to ventral roots after transplantation into the spinal cord of adult rats with motor neuron injury. However, such axon targeting requires the presence of multiple complex factors, including GDNF, within the fiber tracts to attract donor axons. In recent experiments, mouse ESC-derived motor neurons that were transplanted into transected tibial nerves of adult mice established normal motor units and attenuated muscle atrophy. The main problem with this method is how to regulate the function of these motor neurons to affect movement when they are placed within the nerve rather than the spinal cord. While the death of motor neurons in ALS leads to paralysis, dysfunctional astrocytes may also play a role in the overall health and survival of sick motor neurons. Therefore, new strategies to transplant stem-cell-derived astrocytes that could protect dying motor neurons in ALS are also underway in many laboratories. Human stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neuroblasts, which will be required for patient applications, can survive in animal models of PD, and, after maturation, exert functional effects. However, some properties of stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neurons that are fundamental for successful clinical translation need to be confirmed in further studies, including evidence that they can substantially reinnervate the striatum, restore dopamine release in vivo, and markedly improve deficits that resemble the symptoms experienced by PD patients. Experimental work establishing these properties remains to be performed before a human stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neuroblast can be selected as a candidate cell for patient application. More specifically, these cells should be tested in a range of appropriate animal models, which in the first instance will be the unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of PD in rats. The cells must be shown to survive long-term and differentiate into the appropriate neuronal phenotype, i.e., midbrain doepaminergic neurons. Ongoing cell division must not be present beyond 1–2 months after transplantation, and the migration pattern of the cells should be defined. The connectivity of cells to the host should be demonstrated using standard immunohistochemical staining and in selected cases be combined with anterograde and retrograde tracers. A major portion of the striatum (>50%) should be evenly innervated by graft-derived dopaminergic fibers. The ability of the grafted cells to mediate sustained functional behavioral effects in the animal model of PD must be shown by the following ways:drug-induced rotation with a 100% reduction in amphetamine-induced rotation, which can be achieved by relatively low numbers of dopaminergic cells (∼300) as is seen with fetal mesencephalic tissue grafts;significant recovery in performance in stepping, placing, or cylinder tests in rats; andthe characterization of any changes in skilled reaching as compared with the limits of efficacy using primary fetal mesencephalic tissue grafts. For a cellular replacement approach to HD, it must be shown that the grafted cells survive long-term in appropriate animal models. The cells should differentiate into medium spiny striatal projection neurons. When integrated into the brain, the transplant should contain at least 30%–50% medium spiny neurons as seen for transplants of cells derived from the fetal ganglionic eminence. The migration pattern of the cells should be known in addition to their connectivity to the host. Ongoing cell division must not be present beyond 1–2 months after transplantation. The grafted cells should be able to induce behavioral improvements, and this functional recovery should be sustained. This should involve beneficial effects on the following deficits in animals with unilateral striatal lesions:paw reaching with the contralateral paw; andpoor performance on tasks of sensorimotor integration such as contralateral neglect or a lateralized choice reaction time task; and should provide beneficial effects in bilaterally lesioned animals with respect to:normalization of locomotor activity; andalleviation of deficits in a relevant cognitive task sensitive to fronto-striatal dysfunction, such as delayed alternation. For neuronal replacement therapy for ALS, the stem cells must be competent to make functional motor neurons. This generally requires ESCs or iPSCs as the source and increases the risk of teratoma formation. Once the cells have been characterized in vitro, they must be tested in vivo and shown to be able to survive long-term at multiple CNS sites, integrate into existing spinal cord neural circuitries, and receive appropriate regulatory input and extend their axons over long distances to reinnervate muscles. Finally, the transplanted motor neurons must induce a clear functional benefit. While the SOD1 models provide a good preclinical base for moving these types of studies forward, the environment of this model may not be representative of that found in sporadic human ALS patients. Therefore, new genetic models or models based on motor neuron lesions using toxins should also be considered. The transplantation of stem cells for increased neuroprotection through the production of healthy astrocytes and/or the release of neurotrophic molecules, the modification of the inflammatory environment, or the generation of interneurons is a more realistic near-term clinical goal for ALS. Preclinical data must show the protection of motor neurons in the SOD1 model and/or other motor neuron lesion models using the strategy suggested for patients. Ideally, this should be associated with functional improvement in the animals, although simply protecting the motor neurons in these animal models may be enough evidence to support moving forward to the clinic, because these models clearly do not represent sporadic ALS. To be clinically competitive as a treatment for PD, stem-cell-based dopaminergic cell replacement therapy must induce the substantial (at least 50%–70%) amelioration of motor symptoms without significant side effects. This could be achieved if patients are carefully selected and the dose and site of implantation of the dopaminergic cells are based on preoperative imaging. Strategies to prevent the occurrence of graft-induced dyskinesias following cell therapy must be developed, e.g., by minimizing the number of serotonergic neuroblasts in the transplant material and by distributing the dopaminergic neuroblasts evenly over the striatum. The use of stem-cell-derived neurons for replacement in HD is on less secure footing, given that it is still unclear whether primary allografts of fetal striatal tissue provide substantial and prolonged clinical benefits to patients with HD. Nevertheless, there is sufficient data from open-label studies to suggest that transplants containing striatal tissue can ameliorate and reverse some aspects of the disease. As such, stem-cell-derived transplants for HD could be useful in two major ways: (1) by replacing lost striatal projection neurons; and (2) by providing a local source of neurotrophic factors to support this same population. Stem cells may be capable of doing both of these functions at the same time. The successful administration of stem cell transplants will critically depend on them being implanted at the optimal stage of the disease course, which is likely to be in early stage patients. Motor neuron replacement in ALS will probably be attempted first at the level of the spinal cord. These initial studies will clearly be “proof of concept,” be limited to a few spinal cord segments, and must be based upon extensive preclinical data. These studies need to be designed to show that the motor neurons survive transplantation without forming teratomas, that they can project axons into the ventral roots, and that some reach the muscle and make connections. The challenge will be that the disease progresses so rapidly that the patient may die before the growing axons reach their target. After the transplantation of stem-cell-derived dopaminergic neuroblasts and their subsequent maturation, they must exhibit the properties of substantia nigra neurons to induce substantial benefit for treating PD. It must be possible to grow the cells in vitro in sufficient numbers to achieve a level of engraftment that makes those cells useful in the clinical setting. The definition of a dopaminergic nigral neuron derived from stem cell sources includes the expression by immunohistochemistry of phenotypic markers typical for those cells and the appropriate expression profiles of genes and transcription factors that define that specific region of the brain during normal nigral development. The cells need to exhibit excitability using appropriate neurophysiological measures and dopamine release in response to standard in vitro stimuli. All cell types in the cultures need to be identified, especially the number of nonnigral dopaminergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, other nondopaminergic neurons, glial elements, undifferentiated precursor/stem cells, and, in the case of ESC- and iPSC-derived preparations, nonneural cells. Recently, it has become possible to directly convert fibroblasts into functional “induced” neurons (iNs), including midbrain dopaminergic neurons. It remains to be explored to what extent iNs can contribute to functional restoration in models of PD. For HD, the cells grown in vitro must differentiate into striatal projection neurons (DARPP32+/GABA+) with a degree of efficacy that would make translation to the clinic practical. The proportion of other types of neurons should be determined using markers for striatal interneuron phenotypes (which may be critical for the grafts to achieve optimal function), in addition to markers of nonstriatal phenotypes (which may be considered to be contaminants). The definition of a striatal projection neuron includes the expression of typical phenotypic markers by immunohistochemistry, the profiles of genes/transcription factors that define that brain region during normal striatal development, and at least some of the receptor subtypes and neuropeptides typically found in striatal projection neurons. The cells should be able to release GABA and exhibit the excitability properties of neurons. For ALS, the nature of the donor cells to be used for transplantation is still open to discussion. Whereas motor neuron replacement represents an ideal target, successful in vivo cell delivery, integration both into the motor cortex and across multiple levels along the anteroposterior axis, and targeted axon outgrowth currently pose insurmountable challenges. For such a neuronal replacement strategy, motor neuron progenitors would have to be delivered at a still immature, migratory stage to enable the donor cells to actively infiltrate the motor cortex and the ventral columns of the spinal cord and brainstem. Considering the recently discovered non-cell-autonomous effects of astrocytes from SOD1 mutants and sporadic variants on wild-type motor neurons, ALS might also represent a candidate disease for glial transplantation. However, further studies in animal models are required to explore whether wild-type astrocytes or glial cells engineered to express neurotrophic factors can home in on motor neuron territories and protect host cells from disease-related damage or death.

https://openalex.org/W2132865972,"Background Family caregivers of dementia patients are at increased risk of developing depression or anxiety. A multi-component program designed to mobilize support of family networks demonstrated effectiveness in decreasing depressive symptoms in caregivers. However, the impact of an intervention consisting solely of family meetings on depression and anxiety has not yet been evaluated. This study examines the preventive effects of family meetings for primary caregivers of community-dwelling dementia patients. Methods A randomized multicenter trial was conducted among 192 primary caregivers of community dwelling dementia patients. Caregivers did not meet the diagnostic criteria for depressive or anxiety disorder at baseline. Participants were randomized to the family meetings intervention (n = 96) or usual care (n = 96) condition. The intervention consisted of two individual sessions and four family meetings which occurred once every 2 to 3 months for a year. Outcome measures after 12 months were the incidence of a clinical depressive or anxiety disorder and change in depressive and anxiety symptoms (primary outcomes), caregiver burden and quality of life (secondary outcomes). Intention-to-treat as well as per protocol analyses were performed. Results A substantial number of caregivers (72/192) developed a depressive or anxiety disorder within 12 months. The intervention was not superior to usual care either in reducing the risk of disorder onset (adjusted IRR 0.98; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.38) or in reducing depressive (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = −1.40; 95% CI −3.91 to 1.10) or anxiety symptoms (randomization-by-time interaction coefficient = −0.55; 95% CI −1.59 to 0.49). The intervention did not reduce caregiver burden or their health related quality of life. Conclusion This study did not demonstrate preventive effects of family meetings on the mental health of family caregivers. Further research should determine whether this intervention might be more beneficial if provided in a more concentrated dose, when applied for therapeutic purposes or targeted towards subgroups of caregivers.

https://openalex.org/W2060345644,"Piwi proteins have been implicated in germ cell proliferation, differentiation, germline stem cell maintenance and transposon control in germline from Drosophila to mammals. The Piwi-like2 (piwil2) gene is mainly expressed in testis or embryonic cells among normal tissues but widely expressed in tumors. However, it remains to be fully determined through which mechanism piwil2 is involved in tumorigenesis. Here we report that Human piwil2, or Hili represses the tumor suppressor P53 in human cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows that Piwil2 can directly associate with Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) protein via its PAZ domain and form a Piwil2/STAT3/c-Src triple protein-protein complex. Furthermore, STAT3 is phosphorylated by c-Src and translocated to nucleus, then binds to P53 promoter and represses its transcription. The present study demonstrated that Piwil2 plays a role in anti-apoptosis in tumor cells possessing P53 as a positive regulator of STAT3 signaling pathway, providing novel sights into roles of Piwil2 in tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2083048250,"The inability of seasonal influenza vaccines to effectively protect against infection with antigenically drifted viruses or newly emerging pandemic viruses underlines the need for development of cross-reactive influenza vaccines that induce immunity against a variety of virus subtypes. Therefore, potential cross-protective vaccines, e.g., whole inactivated virus (WIV) vaccine, that can target conserved internal antigens such as the nucleoprotein (NP) and/or matrix protein (M1) need to be explored.In the current study we show that a WIV vaccine, through induction of cross-protective cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), protects mice from heterosubtypic infection. This protection was abrogated after depletion of CD8+ cells in vaccinated mice, indicating that CTLs were the primary mediators of protection. Previously, we have shown that different procedures used for virus inactivation influence optimal activation of CTLs by WIV, most likely by affecting the membrane fusion properties of the virus. Specifically, inactivation with formalin (FA) severely compromises fusion activity of the virus, while inactivation with β-propiolactone (BPL) preserves fusion activity. Here, we demonstrate that vaccination of mice with BPL-inactivated H5N1 WIV vaccine induces solid protection from lethal heterosubtypic H1N1 challenge. By contrast, vaccination with FA-inactivated WIV, while preventing death after lethal challenge, failed to protect against development of disease and severe body weight loss. Vaccination with BPL-inactivated WIV, compared to FA-inactivated WIV, induced higher levels of specific CD8+ T cells in blood, spleen and lungs, and a higher production of granzyme B in the lungs upon H1N1 virus challenge.The results underline the potential use of WIV as a cross-protective influenza vaccine candidate. However, careful choice of the virus inactivation procedure is important to retain membrane fusion activity and full immunogenicity of the vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2062750992,"The common carp is one of the most important cultivated species in the world of freshwater aquaculture. The cultivation of this species is particularly productive due to its high skeletal muscle mass; however, the molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle development in the common carp remain unknown. It has been shown that a class of non-coding ∼22 nucleotide RNAs called microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in vertebrate development. They regulate gene expression through sequence-specific interactions with the 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of target mRNAs and thereby cause translational repression or mRNA destabilization. Intriguingly, the role of miRNAs in the skeletal muscle development of the common carp remains unknown. In this study, a small-RNA cDNA library was constructed from the skeletal muscle of the common carp, and Solexa sequencing technology was used to perform high throughput sequencing of the library. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis identified 188 conserved miRNAs and 7 novel miRNAs in the carp skeletal muscle. The miRNA expression profiling showed that, miR-1, miR-133a-3p, and miR-206 were specifically expressed in muscle-containing organs, and that miR-1, miR-21, miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-133a-3p, miR-206, miR-214 and miR-222 were differentially expressed in the process of skeletal muscle development of the common carp. This study provides a first identification and profiling of miRNAs related to the muscle biology of the common carp. Their identification could provide clues leading towards a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of carp skeletal muscle development."

Here, we identify that ATF2 tumor suppressor function is determined by its ability to localize at the mitochondria, where it alters membrane permeability following genotoxic stress. The ability of ATF2 to reach the mitochondria is determined by PKCε, which directs ATF2 nuclear localization. Genotoxic stress attenuates PKCε effect on ATF2; enables ATF2 nuclear export and localization at the mitochondria, where it perturbs the HK1-VDAC1 complex; increases mitochondrial permeability; and promotes apoptosis. Significantly, high levels of PKCε, as seen in melanoma cells, block ATF2 nuclear export and function at the mitochondria, thereby attenuating apoptosis following exposure to genotoxic stress.

Lau E. Ronai Z. Emerging roles of ATF2 and the dynamic AP1 network in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The diverse transcriptional functions of ATF2 are attributed to its homo- or heterodimerization with other AP-1 transcription factors via a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, in concert with its phosphorylation by stress kinases, JNK or p38, on residues 69/71 (Gupta et al., 1995Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Transcription factor ATF2 regulation by the JNK signal transduction pathway.Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). As a stress-inducible transcription factor, ATF2 regulates gene expression programs implicated in cell-cycle control, cytokine expression, and cell death (Lopez-Bergami et al., 2010Lopez-Bergami P. Lau E. Ronai Z. Emerging roles of ATF2 and the dynamic AP1 network in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2010; 10: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition to its transcriptional role, ATF2 functions in the DNA damage response, which requires ATM-dependent phosphorylation on residues 490/498. Mice harboring mutations at these sites are more radiosensitive and genetically unstable when crossed with p53 mutant mice or when subjected to a skin carcinogenesis protocol (Bhoumik et al., 2005Bhoumik A.

Though the above functions require nuclear localization, growing evidence points to cytoplasmic localization of ATF2, although its function there remains elusive. In melanomas, nuclear ATF2 is associated with metastasis and poor prognosis, whereas cytoplasmic ATF2 is associated with nonmalignant skin cancers and better prognosis (Berger et al., 2003Berger A.J. Kluger H.M. Li N. Kielhorn E. Halaban R. Ronai Z. Rimm D.L.

ATF2 transcriptional activity (which requires nuclear localization) is required for melanoma development, as demonstrated in the N-Ras/Ink4a mouse melanoma model (Shah et al., 2010Shah M. Bhoumik A.

Jones N. Ronai Z. Transcriptional switch by activating transcription factor 2-derived peptide sensitizes melanoma cells to apoptosis and inhibits their tumorigenicity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 4222-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast, ATF2 cytosolic localization, as seen in nonmalignant skin cancer, is associated with a tumor suppressor role; inhibiting ATF2 in keratinocytes results in a greater number of skin papillomas that develop more rapidly than WT ATF2-expressing keratinocytes (Bhoumik et al., 2008Bhoumik A. Fichtman B. Derossi C. Breitwieser W. Kluger H.M. Davis S. Subtil A. Meltzer P. Krajewski S. Jones N. Ronai Z. Suppressor role of activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) in skin cancer.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 1674-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We investigated mechanisms underlying the ability of ATF2 to elicit diverse nuclear and cytoplasmic functions and report that ATF2 functions at the mitochondria in response to genotoxic stress. We found that, at the mitochondrial outer membrane, ATF2 abrogates formation of high-order complexes containing hexokinase-1 (HK1) and voltage-dependent anion channel-1 (VDAC1), deregulating mitochondrial outer-membrane permeability and initiating apoptosis. This function is negatively regulated by PKCε phosphorylation of ATF2, which dictates its nuclear localization. Of note, elevated expression and activity of PKCε was reported in different tumor types and is associated with poorer outcome and inhibition of tumor cell death (Bae et al., 2007Bae K.M. Wang H. Jiang G. Chen M.G. Lu L. Xiao L. Protein kinase C epsilon is overexpressed in primary human non-small cell lung cancers and functionally required for proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells in a p21/Cip1-dependent manner.Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6053-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Whereas PKCε overexpression promotes the development of squamous carcinomas (Sand et al., 2010Sand J.M. Aziz M.H. Dreckschmidt N.E. Havighurst T.C. Kim K. Oberley T.D. Verma A.K. PKCepsilon overexpression, irrespective of genetic background, sensitizes skin to UVR-induced development of squamous-cell carcinomas.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2010; 130: 270-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), its inhibition sensitizes tumor cells to cell death (Gillespie et al., 2005Gillespie S. Zhang X.D. Hersey P. Variable expression of protein kinase C epsilon in human melanoma cells regulates sensitivity to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.Mol. Cancer Ther. 2005; 4: 668-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The identification of mechanisms underlying ATF2 subcellular localization and cytosolic function offers a framework for understanding the regulation of opposing functions for the same transcription factor. Although ATF2 cytoplasmic localization was previously reported (Berger et al., 2003Berger A.J. Kluger H.M. Li N. Kielhorn E. Halaban R. Ronai Z. Rimm D.L. Subcellular localization of activating transcription factor 2 in melanoma specimens predicts patient survival.Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8103-8107PubMed Google Scholar, Bhoumik et al., 2008Bhoumik A.

Based on the observed cytosolic localization of ATF2 in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors, we employed a SCC line (SCC9) to analyze potential ATF2 cytoplasmic function. Mass spectrometric (MS) analysis of cytosol-localized ATF2-bound proteins in SCC9 cells identified a cluster of mitochondria-outer membrane-related proteins, suggesting an ATF2 mitochondrial interaction (Table S1 available online). Indeed, nonstressed SCC9 cells exhibit predominantly nuclear ATF2, whereas genotoxic stress rendered by etoposide (ETO) resulted in its accumulation at mitochondria in ∼64% of treated cells (Figure 1A ). Other genotoxic insults, including ultraviolet C (UVC, 20 J/m2) and ionizing irradiation (IR, 5Gy), also prompted the mitochondrial localization of ATF2 (Figure 1A). The mitochondrial localization of ATF2 following genotoxic stimuli was also seen in other cell types, including normal human fibroblasts (HSF), primary human keratinocytes (NHEK), and melanocytes (HEM), as well as in other SCC cell lines (M7 and P9) (Figure S1). Of note, whereas some melanoma cell lines (UACC903) exhibit partial mitochondrial enrichment of ATF2 (Figures S1 and 6D), a number of melanoma cell lines (LU1205 and 501Mel) (Figures S1 and 6D) did not exhibit mitochondrial localization of ATF2 following genotoxic stimuli, with the exception of IR (Figure S1), suggesting that malignant melanomas are largely resistant to genotoxic stress-induced mitochondrial translocation of ATF2. The extent of ATF2 mitochondrial localization differs among the different cultures and type of stimuli, indicating variation in cellular response and control of such translocation in each of these cultures. Biochemical fractionation of SCC9 cells confirmed that exposure to genotoxic stress results in the accumulation of ATF2 in mitochondrial-enriched fractions (Figure 1B).Figure S1Mitochondrial Localization of ATF2 following Treatment with ETO, UVC, or IR in NHEK, P9, M7, HSF, UACC903, 501MEL, LU1205, and HEM, Related to Figure 1Show full captionIndicated cell lines were treated with either 5 μM etoposide (ETO), 20 J/m2 UVC (UVC), or 5 Gy of ionizing irradiation (IR), fixed after 16 hr and immunostained for ATF2 (green), HSP60 (red), and DAPI.

Scale bars represent 10μm. Yellow arrowheads indicate regions of ATF2 co-localization with HSP60. Pretreatment of SCC9 cells with the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) prevented mitochondrial accumulation of ATF2 following ETO treatment, indicating that nuclear export of ATF2 occurs after genotoxic stress (Figure 1A, fifth row). Consistently, we observed an ∼50% reduction of luciferase activity driven by the ATF2 response element (Figure 1C). ATF2 protein does not harbor canonical mitochondrial localization or peptide-processing signals, which could facilitate import or insertion into mitochondrial membranes, suggesting that its mitochondrial localization requires interaction with mitochondrial protein(s). Thus, we examined where ATF2 might be accumulating at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), the intermembrane space (IMS), the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM), or the mitochondrial inner matrix. Limited proteolysis protection assays with enriched mitochondrial fractions purified from ETO-treated SCC9 cells revealed efficient degradation of ATF2 in the absence of detergent, consistent with the degradation pattern of the MOM component TOM20 but differing from the pattern of inner-matrix protein COXII, which is degraded only in the presence of detergent (Figure 1D). These results suggest that, in response to genotoxic stress, ATF2 localizes at the MOM. To determine ATF2 function at mitochondria, we tested MOM protein(s) identified in our MS analysis (Table S1), hexokinase-1 (HK1) and voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) (Figure S1), for possible interaction with ATF2. In response to various forms of stress, HK1 and HK2 bind to VDAC1, which oligomerizes to form large molecular weight complexes (Abu-Hamad et al., 2009Abu-Hamad S. Arbel N. Calo D. Arzoine L. Israelson A. Keinan N. Ben-Romano R. Friedman O. Shoshan-Barmatz V. The VDAC1 N-terminus is essential both for apoptosis and the protective effect of anti-apoptotic proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To determine whether ATF2 is part of these complexes, we assessed the distribution of ATF2, HK1, and VDAC1 in fractions obtained following fast protein liquid chromatographic (FPLC) analysis using a gel filtration column. Whereas prior to stress, ATF2 did not codistribute to fractions with HK1 and VDAC1, after ETO treatment, all three proteins were found within high molecular weight fractions (Figure 2A ). Of note, not all of the ATF2 protein redistributed to high MW fractions. The remaining ATF2 in the low MW fraction is consistent with the residual nuclear ATF2 found by IHC and the residual (∼50%) transcriptional activity recorded after ETO treatment (Figures 1A and 1C, respectively). As shown below, distinct posttranslational modification of ATF2 is found in these pools. To confirm the interaction of ATF2 with HK1 and VDAC1, we immunoprecipitated endogenous ATF2 or HK1 from cell lysates of SCC9 cells prior to and after ETO treatment. ATF2 interaction with HK1 and with high molecular weight (∼130 kDa) tetrameric VDAC1 oligomers, detectable with the aid of crosslinker (Zalk et al., 2005Zalk R. Israelson A. Garty E.S. Azoulay-Zohar H. Shoshan-Barmatz V. Oligomeric states of the voltage-dependent anion channel and cytochrome c release from mitochondria.Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), was clearly seen after ETO treatment (Figure 2B, top and bottom). Interestingly, knockdown of HK1, but not HK2, abrogated mitochondrial localization of ATF2 following ETO treatment, indicating that the mitochondrial localization of ATF2 requires HK1 (Figures 2C, 2D, and S2A). Phosphorylation of ATF2 by p38 or JNK on Thr69/71 is required for its dimerization with AP-1 transcription factors and for transcriptional activity (Gupta et al., 1995Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Transcription factor ATF2 regulation by the JNK signal transduction pathway.Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar, van Dam et al., 1995van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. ATF-2 is preferentially activated by stress-activated protein kinases to mediate c-jun induction in response to genotoxic agents.EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). However, Thr69/71 phosphorylation was dispensable for ATF2 mitochondrial localization, as inhibition of either p38 or JNK activity by respective pharmacological inhibitors did not alter its nuclear localization (Figure S2B ). Analysis of ATF2 protein sequence using the phosphorylation site scanning program (http://scansite.mit.edu) predicted an uncharacterized but highly probable PKCε/δ/ζ phosphorylation site on residue Thr52. Treatment with the PKCε translocation inhibitor (PKCε-i) promoted mitochondrial localization of ATF2, even in the absence of ETO, as detected by both IHC and mitochondrial fractionation (Figures 3A and S3F). Consistently, siRNA-mediated knockdown of PKCε (Figure S3A ) promoted mitochondrial localization of ATF2 (Figure 3B), whereas overexpression of a constitutively active form of PKCε (caPKCε; Pass et al., 2001Pass J.M. Zheng Y. Wead W.B. Zhang J. Li R.C. Bolli R. Ping P. PKCepsilon activation induces dichotomous cardiac phenotypes and modulates PKCepsilon-RACK interactions and RACK expression.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2001; 280: H946-H955PubMed Google Scholar) attenuated ATF2 accumulation at mitochondria following ETO treatment (Figure 3C). As with the genotoxic stress-induced nuclear export of ATF2 (Figure 1A), LMB pretreatment blocked its mitochondrial translocation following PKCε inhibition (Figure S3E). Inhibition of the novel (δ) or atypical (ζ) PKC forms had negligible effect on mitochondrial ATF2 localization (Figure S3B). These observations indicate that ATF2 mitochondrial localization is primarily regulated by PKCε. Of note, Ser729 phosphorylation on PKCε, an indicator of active PKCε, decreases following overnight treatment with ETO or with PKCε-i (Figure 3D), suggesting that the effect of PKCε on the nuclear localization of ATF2 is attenuated following genotoxic stress, enabling ATF2 nuclear export and mitochondrial localization.Figure S3Knockdown of PKC Isoforms, Codistribution of ATF2T52A with VDAC1, and Attenuation of PKCε-i-Induced Mitochondrial ATF2 by Leptomycin B, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Immunoblot analysis of SCC9 cells transfected with 20 nM scrambled (scr) or PKCε-targeted siRNA.(B) SCC9 cells were either infected with PLKO empty vector (EV) or PLKO-shPKCζ for 72 hr (upper) or transfected with 20 nM scr or PKCδ-targeted siRNAs (lower, 1, 2, 3) and immunostained with indicated antibodies or subject to immunoblot analysis.(C) PLKO EV- or shATF2-infected and puromycin-selected SCC9 cells were subject to immunoblot analysis.(D) ATF2T52A or ATF2T52E overexpressing SCC9 cells were subject to gel filtration and immunoblot analysis with indicated antibodies.(E) SCC9 cells were treated with 5 μM PKCε translocation inhibitor (PKCε-i) alone for 16 hr or with 6 hr of pre-treatment with 40 ng/ml leptomycin B.

To determine whether the predicted ATF2 site (Thr52) for phosphorylation by PKCε regulates mitochondrial translocation of ATF2, we assessed PKCε phosphorylation of ATF2 in vitro, as well as the localization of ATF2T52A (a nonphosphorylatable alanine phosphomutant) and ATF2T52E (a glutamic acid phosphomimic). In vitro kinase assays employing an ATF2 fragment consisting of aa 50–100 revealed that PKCε phosphorylates the wild-type (WT), but not the ATF2T52A, peptide. Addition of PKC catalytic inhibitor Gö6850 inhibited this phosphorylation (Figure 3E). Together, these data indicate that Thr52 is a PKCε phosphoacceptor site. Consistent with the nuclear localization observed in the presence of caPKCε, the ATF2T52E mutant exhibited constitutive nuclear localization (Figure 3F), whereas the ATF2T52A mutant localized to the cytoplasm and mitochondria, even in the absence of genotoxic stress (Figure 3F). Gel filtration analysis revealed that ATF2T52A, but not ATF2T52E, distributed to large molecular weight fractions containing VDAC1 (Figure S3D). Interestingly, expression of ATF2T52A revealed less HK1 within the high molecular weight VDAC1-containing fractions, pointing to the possibility that ATF2T52A may attenuate the interaction between HK1 and VDAC1. Collectively, these findings establish that PKCε regulates ATF2 mitochondrial localization via phosphorylation at T52. Given the effect of PKCε on ATF2 subcellular localization, we next assessed its effect on ATF2 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of caPKCε led to a marked increase in Jun2-luciferase activity, indicative of ATF2 transcriptional activity, which was largely attenuated upon knockdown of ATF2 (Figure 3G). Interestingly, inhibition with Gö6850 or ETO treatment reduced Jun2-luciferase activity to similar extents as knockdown of ATF2, suggesting that PKCε contributes to basal transcriptional activity of ATF2 in these cells. Consistently, reconstitution of SCC9 cells carrying a stable knockdown of ATF2 (employing shRNA targeting ATF2 3′UTR) (Figure S3C) with ATF2T52E also increased Jun2-luciferase activity compared to ATF2WT. Conversely, mutation of T52 to alanine abolished ATF2 transcriptional activity (Figure 3H). These findings indicate that, by regulating ATF2 nuclear localization, PKCε not only determines ability of ATF2 to reach the mitochondria, but also its transcriptional activity. Disruption of VDAC interaction with HK1 or HK2 sensitizes cells to stress, promoting MOM leakage of molecules from the IMS (Abu-Hamad et al., 2009Abu-Hamad S. Arbel N. Calo D. Arzoine L. Israelson A. Keinan N. Ben-Romano R. Friedman O. Shoshan-Barmatz V. The VDAC1 N-terminus is essential both for apoptosis and the protective effect of anti-apoptotic proteins.J. Cell Sci. 2009; 122: 1906-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Conversely, HK1 or HK2 binding to the MOM promotes resistance to stress and increased cell survival (Moin et al., 2007Moin S.M. Panteva M. Jameel S.

To assess whether interaction with ATF2 perturbs the HK1/VDAC1 complex, we first evaluated HK1 accumulation at mitochondria following ectopic expression of the ATF2 phosphomutants that preferentially localize to either the nucleus (ATF2T52E) or mitochondria (ATF2T52A) (Figures 4 and S4D). Under basal conditions, HK1 is localized to the cytoplasm and mitochondria (Figure 4A). Of note, mitochondrial colocalization of HK1 was enhanced after ETO treatment (Figure 4B). In ATF2T52E-transfected cells, HK1 accumulation at mitochondria was similar to that seen in control cells prior to and after ETO treatment (Figures 4G and 4H). However, ATF2T52A overexpression abrogated mitochondrial accumulation of HK1 prior to and following genotoxic stress, as indicated by decreased distinct colocalization of HK1 and MitoTracker (Figures 4E and 4F and insets 4E∗ and 4F∗). Of note, ETO-treated, ATFT52A-expressing cells exhibited more fragmented mitochondria compared to cells expressing empty vector, ATF2WT, or ATF2T52E (Figure insets 4E∗ and 4F∗, compared to Figures 4A–4C, 4G, and 4H). Further, the expression of ATF2T52A promoted the appearance of punctated, HK1 positively staining structures that localized near, but not with, the MitoTracker-labeled mitochondrial structures (Figures 4E and 4F and insets E∗ and F∗ and Figure S4E ). These results indicate that mitochondrial translocation of ATF2 perturbs HK1/VDAC1 complexes and MOM integrity. ATF2WT also translocated to the mitochondria and abrogated HK1 localization following genotoxic stress (Figure 4D). Expression of either ATF2WT or the T52 ATF2 mutants did not affect VDAC1 multimerization, a change that promotes mitochondrial leakage and cell death, as assessed by crosslinking and nonreducing immunoblot analysis (data not shown).Figure S4Changes in Mitochondrial Dynamics and Subcellular Localization of ATF2 WT, T52A, and T52E, Related to Figure 4, Figure 5Show full caption(A and B) Cells were transfected with empty vector or HA-tagged wild-type ATF2 (WT), T52A or T52E mutant constructs in the presence (asterisk, red bars) or absence (gray bars) of 5 μM etoposide overnight.

Consistent with our IHC data, overexpression of ATF2T52A abrogated HK1 association with VDAC1 that was immunoprecipitated under basal conditions and following genotoxic stress. Overexpression of ATF2WT abrogated the HK1/VDAC1 complex only after ETO treatment, whereas the ATF2T52E did not affect HK1 binding to VDAC1 (Figure 5A ). In agreement, HK1 association with VDAC1 also decreased following treatment of SCC9 cells with PKCε-i alone or PKCε-i in the presence of ETO (Figure 5B). These data indicate that mitochondria-localized ATF2 attenuates the ability of HK1 to form a complex with VDAC. We next monitored changes in mitochondrial membrane potential that are reflective of leakage. We used fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to quantify tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) uptake, an indicator of relative mitochondrial membrane potential. Consistent with previous reports (Fu et al., 2008Fu X. Wan S. Lyu Y.L. Liu L.F. Qi H.

https://openalex.org/W2123843691,"Sexual maturation and mating in insects are generally accompanied by major physiological and behavioural changes. Many of these changes are related to the need to locate a mate and subsequently, in the case of females, to switch from mate searching to oviposition behaviour. The prodigious reproductive capacity of the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, is one of the factors that has led to its success as an invasive pest species. To identify the molecular changes related to maturation and mating status in male and female medfly, a microarray-based gene expression approach was used to compare the head transcriptomes of sexually immature, mature virgin, and mated individuals. Attention was focused on the changes in abundance of transcripts related to reproduction, behaviour, sensory perception of chemical stimulus, and immune system processes. Broad transcriptional changes were recorded during female maturation, while post-mating transcriptional changes in females were, by contrast, modest. In male medfly, transcriptional changes were consistent both during maturation and as a consequence of mating. Of particular note was the lack of the mating-induced immune responses that have been recorded for Drosophila melanogaster, that may be due to the different reproductive strategies of these species. This study, in addition to increasing our understanding of the molecular machinery behind maturation and mating in the medfly, has identified important gene targets that might be useful in the future management of this pest."
https://openalex.org/W2002772045,"Increasing evidence suggests tumors are maintained by cancer stem cells; however, their nature remains controversial. In a HoxA9-Meis1 (H9M) model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we found that tumor-initiating activity existed in three, immunophenotypically distinct compartments, corresponding to disparate lineages on the normal hematopoietic hierarchy--stem/progenitor cells (Lin(-)kit(+)) and committed progenitors of the myeloid (Gr1(+)kit(+)) and lymphoid lineages (Lym(+)kit(+)). These distinct tumor-initiating cells (TICs) clonally recapitulated the immunophenotypic spectrum of the original tumor in vivo (including cells with a less-differentiated immunophenotype) and shared signaling networks, such that in vivo pharmacologic targeting of conserved TIC survival pathways (DNA methyltransferase and MEK phosphorylation) significantly increased survival. Collectively, H9M AML is organized as an atypical hierarchy that defies the strict lineage marker boundaries and unidirectional differentiation of normal hematopoiesis. Moreover, this suggests that in certain malignancies tumor-initiation activity (or ""cancer stemness"") can represent a cellular state that exists independently of distinct immunophenotypic definition."
https://openalex.org/W2042112205,"With the rapid increase of protein sequences in the post-genomic age, it is challenging to develop accurate and automated methods for reliably and quickly predicting their subcellular localizations. Till now, many efforts have been tried, but most of which used only a single algorithm. In this paper, we proposed an ensemble classifier of KNN (k-nearest neighbor) and SVM (support vector machine) algorithms to predict the subcellular localization of eukaryotic proteins based on a voting system. The overall prediction accuracies by the one-versus-one strategy are 78.17%, 89.94% and 75.55% for three benchmark datasets of eukaryotic proteins. The improved prediction accuracies reveal that GO annotations and hydrophobicity of amino acids help to predict subcellular locations of eukaryotic proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2090494804,"There continues to be a significant clinical need for rapid and reliable intraoperative margin assessment during cancer surgery. Here we describe a portable, quantitative, optical fiber probe-based, spectroscopic tissue scanner designed for intraoperative diagnostic imaging of surgical margins, which we tested in a proof of concept study in human tissue for breast cancer diagnosis. The tissue scanner combines both diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (IFS), and has hyperspectral imaging capability, acquiring full DRS and IFS spectra for each scanned image pixel. Modeling of the DRS and IFS spectra yields quantitative parameters that reflect the metabolic, biochemical and morphological state of tissue, which are translated into disease diagnosis. The tissue scanner has high spatial resolution (0.25 mm) over a wide field of view (10 cm×10 cm), and both high spectral resolution (2 nm) and high spectral contrast, readily distinguishing tissues with widely varying optical properties (bone, skeletal muscle, fat and connective tissue). Tissue-simulating phantom experiments confirm that the tissue scanner can quantitatively measure spectral parameters, such as hemoglobin concentration, in a physiologically relevant range with a high degree of accuracy (<5% error). Finally, studies using human breast tissues showed that the tissue scanner can detect small foci of breast cancer in a background of normal breast tissue. This tissue scanner is simpler in design, images a larger field of view at higher resolution and provides a more physically meaningful tissue diagnosis than other spectroscopic imaging systems currently reported in literatures. We believe this spectroscopic tissue scanner can provide real-time, comprehensive diagnostic imaging of surgical margins in excised tissues, overcoming the sampling limitation in current histopathology margin assessment. As such it is a significant step in the development of a platform technology for intraoperative management of cancer, a clinical problem that has been inadequately addressed to date."
https://openalex.org/W2058564747,"Human beings are endowed with a unique motivation to be included in social interactions. This natural social motivation, in turn, is thought to encourage behaviours such as flattery or self-deprecation aimed to ease interaction and to enhance the reputation of the individual who produces them. If this is the case, diminished social interest should affect reputation management. Here, we use Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) –primarily characterised by pervasive social disinterest– as a model to investigate the effect of social motivation on reputation management. Children first rated a set of pictures and were then given the opportunity to inflate their initial ratings in front of an experimenter who declared that she had drawn the picture. Contrary to the controls, children with ASD did not enhance their ratings in the drawer's presence. Moreover, participants' flattery behaviour correlated with self-reports of social enjoyment. Our findings point to a link between diminished social interest and reputation management."
https://openalex.org/W2030940438,"Cancer is largely marked by genetic instability. Specific inhibition of individual proteins or signalling pathways that regulate genetic stability during cell division thus hold a great potential for cancer therapy. The Aurora A kinase is a Ser/Thr kinase that plays a critical role during mitosis and cytokinesis and is found upregulated in several cancer types. It is functionally regulated by its interactions with TPX2, a candidate oncogene. Aurora A inhibitors have been proposed as anticancer drugs that work by blocking its ATP binding site. This site is common to other kinases and hence these inhibitors lack specificity for Aurora A inhibition in particular, thus advocating the need of some alternative inhibition route. Previously, we identified TPX2 as a cellular target for withanone that selectively kill cancer cells. By computational approach, we found here that withanone binds to TPX2-Aurora A complex. In experiment, withanone treatment to cancer cells indeed resulted in dissociation of TPX2-Aurora A complex and disruption of mitotic spindle apparatus proposing this as a mechanism of the anticancer activity of withanone. From docking analysis, non-formation/disruption of the active TPX2-Aurora A association complex could be discerned. Our MD simulation results suggesting the thermodynamic and structural stability of TPX2-Aurora A in complex with withanone further substantiates the binding. We report a computational rationale of the ability of naturally occurring withanone to alter the kinase signalling pathway in an ATP-independent manner and experimental evidence in which withanone cause inactivation of the TPX2-Aurora A complex. The study demonstrated that TPX2-Aurora A complex is a target of withanone, a potential natural anticancer drug."
https://openalex.org/W1976781470,"Human PITX2 mutations are associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, an autosomal-dominant developmental disorder that involves ocular anterior segment defects, dental hypoplasia, craniofacial dysmorphism and umbilical abnormalities. Characterization of the PITX2 pathway and identification of the mechanisms underlying the anomalies associated with PITX2 deficiency is important for better understanding of normal development and disease; studies of pitx2 function in animal models can facilitate these analyses. A knockdown of pitx2 in zebrafish was generated using a morpholino that targeted all known alternative transcripts of the pitx2 gene; morphant embryos generated with the pitx2(ex4/5) splicing-blocking oligomer produced abnormal transcripts predicted to encode truncated pitx2 proteins lacking the third (recognition) helix of the DNA-binding homeodomain. The morphological phenotype of pitx2(ex4/5) morphants included small head and eyes, jaw abnormalities and pericardial edema; lethality was observed at ∼6-8-dpf. Cartilage staining revealed a reduction in size and an abnormal shape/position of the elements of the mandibular and hyoid pharyngeal arches; the ceratobranchial arches were also decreased in size. Histological and marker analyses of the misshapen eyes of the pitx2(ex4/5) morphants identified anterior segment dysgenesis and disordered hyaloid vasculature. In summary, we demonstrate that pitx2 is essential for proper eye and craniofacial development in zebrafish and, therefore, that PITX2/pitx2 function is conserved in vertebrates."
https://openalex.org/W1988001731,"Nipah virus (NiV), a zoonotic paramyxovirus, is highly contagious in swine, and can cause fatal infections in humans following transmission from the swine host. The main viral targets in both species are the respiratory and central nervous systems, with viremia implicated as a mode of dissemination of NiV throughout the host. The presented work focused on the role of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the viremic spread of the virus in the swine host. B lymphocytes, CD4-CD8-, as well as CD4+CD8- T lymphocytes were not permissive to NiV, and expansion of the CD4+CD8- cells early post infection was consistent with functional humoral response to NiV infection observed in swine. In contrast, significant drop in the CD4+CD8- T cell frequency was observed in piglets which succumbed to the experimental infection, supporting the hypothesis that antibody development is the critical component of the protective immune response. Productive viral replication was detected in monocytes, CD6+CD8+ T lymphocytes and NK cells by recovery of infectious virus in the cell supernatants. Virus replication was supported by detection of the structural N and the non-structural C proteins or by detection of genomic RNA increase in the infected cells. Infection of T cells carrying CD6 marker, a strong ligand for the activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule ALCAM (CD166) highly expressed on the microvascular endothelial cell of the blood-air and the blood-brain barrier may explain NiV preferential tropism for small blood vessels of the lung and brain."

Eight Regional Laboratories in the international setting (Regional Laboratories), many located in regions where the HIV-1 epidemic is most prominent, were selected to implement the standardized, GCLP-compliant Neutralizing Antibody Assay for HIV-1 in TZM-bl Cells (TZM-bl NAb Assay). Each laboratory was required to undergo initial training and implementation of the immunologic assay on-site and then perform partial assay re-validation, competency testing, and undergo formal external audits for GCLP compliance. Furthermore, using a newly established external proficiency testing program for the TZM-bl NAb Assay has allowed the Regional Laboratories to assess the comparability of assay results at their site with the results of neutralizing antibody assays performed around the world. As a result, several of the CAVD/CA-VIMC Regional Laboratories are now in the process of conducting or planning to conduct the GCLP-compliant TZM-bl NAb Assay as an indicator of vaccine immunogenicity for ongoing human clinical trials."

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR2) is involved in the OxPAPC-induced EC inflammatory activation. This study examined a role of VEGFR2 in barrier dysfunction caused by high concentrations of OxPAPC and evaluated downstream signaling mechanisms resulting from the effect of OxPAPC in EC from pulmonary and systemic circulation.EC monolayer permeability in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAEC) and human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) was monitored by changes in transendothelial electrical resistance (TER) across EC monolayers. Actin cytoskeleton was examined by immunostaining with Texas Red labeled phalloidin. Phosphorylation of myosin light chains (MLC) and VE-Cadherin was examined by Western blot and immunofluorescence techniques. The role of VEGFR2 in OxPAPC-induced permeability and cytoskeletal arrangement were determined using siRNA-induced VEGFR2 knockdown.Low OxPAPC concentrations (5-20 µg/ml) induced a barrier protective response in both HPAEC and HAEC, while high OxPAPC concentrations (50-100 µg/ml) caused a rapid increase in permeability; actin stress fiber formation and increased MLC phosphorylation were observed as early as 30 min after treatment. VEGFR2 knockdown dramatically decreased the amount of MLC phosphorylation and stress fiber formation caused by high OxPAPC concentrations with modest effects on the amount of VE-cadherin phosphorylation at Y(731). We present evidence that activation of Rho is involved in the OxPAPC/VEGFR2 mechanism of EC permeability induced by high OxPAPC concentrations. Knockdown of VEGFR2 did not rescue the early drop in TER but prevented further development of OxPAPC-induced barrier dysfunction.This study shows that VEGFR2 is involved in the delayed phase of EC barrier dysfunction caused by high OxPAPC concentrations and contributes to stress fiber formation and increased MLC phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2070666063,"The ability of Coxiella burnetii to modulate host cell death may be a critical factor in disease development. In this study, human monocytic THP-1 cells were used to examine the ability of C. burnetii Nine Mile phase II (NMII) to modulate apoptotic signaling. Typical apoptotic cell morphological changes and DNA fragmentation were detected in NMII infected cells at an early stage of infection. FACS analysis using Annexin-V-PI double staining showed the induction of a significant number of apoptotic cells at an early stage of NMII infection. Double staining of apoptotic cell DNA and intracellular C. burnetii indicates that NMII infected cells undergoing apoptosis. Interestingly, caspase-3 was not cleaved in NMII infected cells and the caspase-inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk did not prevent NMII induced apoptosis. Surprisingly, the caspase-3 downstream substrate PARP was cleaved in NMII infected cells. These results suggest that NMII induces apoptosis during an early stage of infection through a caspase-independent pathway in THP-1 cells. In addition, NMII-infected monocytes were unable to prevent exogenous staurosporine-induced apoptotic death. Western blot analysis indicated that NMII infection induced the translocation of AIF from mitochondria into the nucleus. Cytochrome c release and cytosol-to-mitochondrial translocation of the pore-forming protein Bax in NMII infected cells occurred at 24 h post infection. These data suggest that NMII infection induced caspase-independent apoptosis through a mechanism involving cytochrome c release, cytosol-to-mitochondrial translocation of Bax and nuclear translocation of AIF in THP-1 monocytes. Furthermore, NMII infection increased TNF-α production and neutralization of TNF-α in NMII infected cells partially blocked PARP cleavage, suggesting TNF-α may play a role in the upstream signaling involved in NMII induced apoptosis. Antibiotic inhibition of C. burnetii RNA synthesis blocked NMII infection-induced PARP activation. These results suggest that both intracellular C. burnetii replication and secreted TNF-α contribute to NMII infection-triggered apoptosis during an early stage of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2050701924,"Stem cell transplantation (SCT) is a curative treatment for malignant and non malignant diseases. However, transplantation-related complications including cardiovascular disease deteriorate the clinical outcome and quality of life. We have investigated the acute effects of conditioning regimen on the pharmacology, physiology and structure of large elastic arteries and small resistance-sized arteries in a SCT mouse model. Mesenteric resistance arteries and aorta were dissected from Balb/c mice conditioned with busulphan (Bu) and cyclophosphamide (Cy). In vitro isometric force development and pharmacology, in combination with RT-PCR, Western blotting and electron microscopy were used to study vascular properties. Compared with controls, mesenteric resistance arteries from the Bu-Cy group had larger internal circumference, showed enhanced endothelium mediated relaxation and increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Bu-Cy treated animals had lower mean blood pressure and signs of endothelial injury. Aortas of treated animals had a higher reactivity to noradrenaline. We conclude that short-term consequences of Bu-Cy treatment divergently affect large and small arteries of the cardiovascular system. The increased noradrenaline reactivity of large elastic arteries was not associated with increased blood pressure at rest. Instead, Bu-Cy treatment lowered blood pressure via augmented microvascular endothelial dependent relaxation, increased expression of vascular eNOS and remodeling toward a larger lumen. The changes in the properties of resistance arteries can be associated with direct effects of the compounds on vascular wall or possibly indirectly induced via altered translational activity associated with the reduced hematocrit and shear stress. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms that underlie the early effects of conditioning regimen on resistance arteries and may help in designing further investigations to understand the late effects on vascular system."
https://openalex.org/W2018612888,"Bilirubin-related neurotoxicity is an important clinical issue in very low birthweight (VLBW) infants, and the existing literature is inconsistent.To analyze the relationship between maximal serum unconjugated bilirubin levels (SBL) and neurodevelopmental outcome at 2-year corrected age in VLBW infants.Phototherapy was initiated in all infants born before 33 weeks of gestation, according to Maisels' recommendations. Neurodevelopmental assessment at 2-year corrected age was performed in all infants that survived. SBLs collected during the first week of life were used to define three tertiles of max-SBL. The first tertile corresponded to infants with the lowest max-SBL.A total of 724 infants were included in the study, and among them, 631 (87%) were evaluated at two years old. The infants of the first tertile were younger and smaller than the infants of the other two tertiles, in accordance with Maisels' recommendations for very small infants. No difference in the risk of impaired functional outcome among the three groups was observed. However, among infants weighing less than 1001 g, those in the third tertile had a poorer neurodevelopmental prognosis as compared to those in the second tertile (adjusted odds ratio = 6.8, 95% CI: 1.2-36.7, p = 0.03). Considering the results obtained, we propose 196 µmol/L (11.5 mg/dL) when birthweight varies between 1001 and 1500 g, and 170 µmol/L (9.9 mg/dL) when birthweight is less than 1001 g, as recommended max-SBLs (defined as maximal levels of 95(th) percentile curves of SBLs in infants with an optimal outcome). When Maisels' recommendations were applied, max SBLs were higher in 8% of infants weighing 1001-1500 g and in 15% of infants weighing less than 1001 g. Our data seems to validate Maisels' recommendations in the overall population of infants born before 33 weeks of gestation, but not in infants weighing less than 1001 g."
https://openalex.org/W2170437895,"Pollinators for animal pollinated crops can be provided by natural and semi-natural habitats, ranging from large vegetation remnants to small areas of non-crop land in an otherwise highly modified landscape. It is unknown, however, how different small- and large-scale habitat patches interact as pollinator sources. In the intensively managed Argentine Pampas, we studied the additive and interactive effects of large expanses (up to 2200 ha) of natural habitat, represented by untilled isolated “sierras”, and narrow (3–7 m wide) strips of semi-natural habitat, represented by field margins, as pollinator sources for sunflower (Helianthus annus). We estimated visitation rates by feral honey-bees, Apis mellifera, and native flower visitors (as a group) at 1, 5, 25, 50 and 100 m from a field margin in 17 sunflower fields 0–10 km distant from the nearest sierra. Honey-bees dominated the pollinator assemblage accounting for >90% of all visits to sunflower inflorescences. Honey-bee visitation was strongly affected by proximity to the sierras decreasing by about 70% in the most isolated fields. There was also a decline in honey-bee visitation with distance from the field margin, which was apparent with increasing field isolation, but undetected in fields nearby large expanses of natural habitat. The probability of observing a native visitor decreased with isolation from the sierras, but in other respects visitation by flower visitors other than honey-bees was mostly unaffected by the habitat factors assessed in this study. Overall, we found strong hierarchical and interactive effects between the study large and small-scale pollinator sources. These results emphasize the importance of preserving natural habitats and managing actively field verges in the absence of large remnants of natural habitat for improving pollinator services."
https://openalex.org/W2129370118,"Background TBX21 (T cell specific T-box transcription factor) and HLX1 (H.20-like homeobox 1) are crucial transcription factors of TH1-cells, inducing their differentiation and suppressing TH2 commitment, particularly important for early life immune development. This study investigated the influence of TBX21 and HLX1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which have previously been shown to be associated with asthma, on TH1/TH2 lineage cytokines at birth. Methods and Findings Cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) of 200 neonates were genotyped for two TBX21 and three HLX1 SNPs. CBMCs were stimulated with innate (Lipid A, LpA; Peptidoglycan, Ppg), adaptive stimuli (house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 1, Derp1) or mitogen (phytohemagglutinin, PHA). Cytokines, T-cells and mRNA expression of TH1/TH2-related genes were assessed. Atopic diseases during the first 3 years of life were assessed by questionnaire answered by the parents. Carriers of TBX21 promoter SNP rs17250932 and HLX1 promoter SNP rs2738751 showed reduced or trendwise reduced (p≤0.07) IL-5, IL-13 and TNF-α secretion after LpA-stimulation. Carriers of HLX1 SNP rs2738751 had lower IL-13 levels following Ppg-stimulation (p = 0.08). Carriers of HLX1 exon 1 SNP rs12141189 showed increased IL-5 (LpA, p = 0.007; Ppg, p = 0.10), trendwise increased IL-13 (LpA), higher GM-CSF (LpA/Ppg, p≤0.05) and trendwise decreased IFN-γ secretion (Derp1+LpA-stimulation, p = 0.1). Homozygous carriers of HLX1 promoter SNP rs3806325 showed increased IL-13 and IL-6 (unstimulated, p≤0.03). In carriers of TBX21 intron 3 SNP rs11079788 no differences in cytokine secretion were observed. mRNA expression of TH1/TH2-related genes partly correlated with cytokines at protein level. TBX21 SNP rs11079788 carriers developed less symptoms of atopic dermatitis at 3 years of age (p = 0.03). Conclusions Polymorphisms in TBX21 and HLX1 influenced primarily IL-5 and IL-13 secretion after LpA-stimulation in cord blood suggesting that genetic variations in the transcription factors essential for the TH1-pathway may contribute to modified TH2-immune responses already early in life. Further follow-up of the cohort is required to study the polymorphisms' relevance for immune-mediated diseases such as childhood asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2022539675,"Climate warming may drive invasions by exotic plants, thereby raising concerns over the risks of invasive plants. However, little is known about how climate warming influences the growth and competitive ability of exotic plants from their home and introduced ranges. We conducted a common garden experiment with an invasive plant Centaurea maculosa and a native plant Poa pratensis, in which a mixture of sand and vermiculite was used as a neutral medium, and contrasted the total biomass, competitive effects, and competitive responses of C. maculosa populations from Europe (home range) and North America (introduced range) under two different temperatures. The warming-induced inhibitory effects on the growth of C. maculosa alone were stronger in Europe than in North America. The competitive ability of C. maculosa plants from North America was greater than that of plants from Europe under the ambient condition whereas this competitive ability followed the opposite direction under the warming condition, suggesting that warming may enable European C. maculosa to be more invasive. Across two continents, warming treatment increased the competitive advantage instead of the growth advantage of C. maculosa, suggesting that climate warming may facilitate C. maculosa invasions through altering competitive outcomes between C. maculosa and its neighbors. Additionally, the growth response of C. maculosa to warming could predict its ability to avoid being suppressed by its neighbors."
https://openalex.org/W2075192688,"CARD-containing MAGUK protein 1 (CARMA1) plays a crucial role in regulating adaptive immune responses upon T-cell receptor (TCR) activation in T cells. Its role in regulating host mucosal innate immune response such as upregulation of mucin remains unknown. Here we show that CARMA1 acts as a key signaling mediator for synergistic upregulation of MUC5AC mucin by bacterium nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) and phorbol ester PMA in respiratory epithelial cells. NTHi-induced TLR-dependent TRAF6-MKK3-p38 MAPK signaling pathway synergizes with PKCθ-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. CARMA1 plays a crucial role in mediating this synergistic effect via TRAF6, thereby resulting in synergistic upregulation of MUC5AC mucin. Thus our study unveils a novel role for CARMA1 in mediating host mucosal innate immune response."

All demographic covariates and co-morbidities were deliberately matched between the two groups to avoid selection bias. Every subject was followed-up for up to five years for stroke. Adjustments using a Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier analyses were conducted.A total of 1,989 osteoporotic patients were followed up for 3,760.13 person-years. Overall, the incidence rates of any stroke, hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke were 22.6, 4.2 and 19.6 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. Patients who underwent vertebroplasty were not more likely to have any stroke (crude hazard ratio = 1.13, p = 0.693), hemorrhagic stroke (HR = 2.21, p = 0.170), or ischemic stroke (HR = 0.96, p = 0.90). After adjusting for demographics, co-morbidities and medications, the vertebroplasty group had no significant difference with the comparison group in terms of any, hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes (adjusted HR = 1.22, 3.17, and 0.96, p = 0.518, 0.055, and 0.91, respectively).Osteoporotic patients who undergo percutaneous vertebroplasty are not at higher risk of any stroke in the next five years after the procedure."
