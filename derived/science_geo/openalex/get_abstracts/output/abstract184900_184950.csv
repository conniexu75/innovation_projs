However, their role in cancer progression remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that Claudin-7 (CLDN-7) expression is lower in invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) of the breast than in normal breast epithelium, as determined by both RT-PCR (9/10) and Western analysis (6/8). Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and IDC showed that the loss of CLDN-7 expression correlated with histological grade in both DCIS (P<0.001, n=38) and IDC (P=0.014, n=31), occurring predominantly in high-grade (Nuclear and Elston grade 3) lesions. Tissue array analysis of 355 IDC cases further confirmed the inverse correlation between CLDN-7 expression and histological grade (P=0.03). This pattern of expression is consistent with the biological function of CLDN-7, as greater discohesion is typically observed in high-grade lesions. In line with this observation, by IHC analysis, CLDN-7 expression was lost in the vast majority (13/17) of cases of lobular carcinoma in situ, which is defined by cellular discohesion. In fact, inducing disassociation of MCF-7 and T47D cells in culture by treating with HGF/scatter factor resulted in a loss of CLDN-7 expression within 24 h. Silencing of CLDN-7 expression correlated with promoter hypermethylation as determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and nucleotide sequencing in breast cancer cell lines (3/3), but not in IDCs (0/5). In summary, these studies provide insight into the potential role of CLDN-7 in the progression and ability of breast cancer cells to disseminate."

G., Welcker, M., Bartek, J., and Lukas, J. (2000) Science 288, 1425–1429; Falck, J., Mailand, N., Syljuasen, R. G., Bartek, J., and Lukas J. (2001) Nature 410, 842–847). The degradation of Cdc25A is abrogated by caffeine, which implicates Chk1 as the potential mediator (Mailand, N., Falck, J., Lukas, C., Syljuasen, R. G., Welcker, M., Bartek, J., and Lukas, J. (2000) Science 288, 1425–1429). However, the involvement of Chk1 is far from clear, because caffeine is a rather nonspecific inhibitor of the ATR/Chk1 signaling pathway. Additionally, it is not known whether DNA-damaging drugs commonly used in chemotherapy, which may activate different signal transduction pathways than UV or IR, also confer Cdc25A degradation. Herein, we show that camptothecin and doxorubicin, two widely used topoisomerase inhibitors conferring S and G2 arrest, respectively, cause the degradation of Cdc25A. Using a small interfering RNA that enables the specific elimination of Chk1 expression, we show that the observed proteolysis of Cdc25A is mediated through Chk1. Moreover, Cdc25A overexpression abrogates the Chk1-mediated degradation and overcomes the doxorubicin-induced G2 arrest through dephosphorylation and activation of Cdc2/Cdk1 in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that: (a) Cdc25A is involved in the G2/M transition in addition to its commonly accepted effect on G1/S progression, and (b) Chk1 mediates both S and G2 checkpoint and is thus a more ubiquitous cell cycle checkpoint mediator than previously thought. UV and ionizing radiation (IR) activate DNA damage checkpoints and induce Cdc25A degradation (Mailand, N., Falck, J., Lukas, C., Syljuasen, R. G., Welcker, M., Bartek, J., and Lukas, J.

DNA damage caused by different agents induces cell cycle arrest at G1, S, or G2, thereby preventing replication of damaged DNA or aberrant mitosis until the damage is adequately repaired. These regulatory mechanisms are known as cell cycle checkpoints and involve an intricate network of protein kinase signaling pathways. They are central to the maintenance of genomic integrity and basic viability of the cells. Hence, defects in these pathways may result in either tumorigenesis or apoptosis depending on the severity and particular nature of the defects (3Walworth N. Curr. Opin.

Upon DNA damage, Chk1 is activated by ATR-mediated phosphorylation. Active Chk1 phosphorylates the protein phosphatase Cdc25C at serine 216. This leads to the nuclear export of Cdc25C and its subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration by 14-3-3 protein, which prevents the activation of the downstream target of Cdc25C, the cyclin B/Cdc2 kinase that is responsible for G2/M transition (6Sanchez Y.

In addition to the role of ATR/Chk1 in G2/M progression, recent experiments using dominant negative ATR showed that the ATR/Chk1 pathway may also play an important role in the S checkpoint induced by topoisomerase I inhibitors (8Cliby W.A.

By removing inhibitory phosphates from tyrosine and threonine residues of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Cdc25 phosphatases activate the CDKs and promote cell cycle progression. In fission yeast, Cdc25 is a stimulator of the G2/M transition because of its activation of Cdc2. In mammalian cells, three Cdc25 analogues, Cdc25A, -B, and -C, have been identified (9Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 10Nagata A. Igarashi M. Jinno S. Suto K. Okayama H. New Biol. 1991; 3: 959-967PubMed Google Scholar) that rescue the growth defect of Cdc25-null Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells. In addition to the aforementioned Cdc25C, which promotes the G2/M transition through dephosphorylation of Cdc2, Cdc25B was proposed to act as an initiator of the same process (11Gabrielli B.G.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, overexpression of Cdc25A activates cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2 by inducing Cdk2 tyrosine dephosphorylation. This demonstrates that Cdc25A is involved in S phase (13Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 14Vigo E. Muller H. Prosperini E. Hateboer G. Cartwright P. Moroni M.C. Helin K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6379-6395Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly, Cdc25A overexpression causes a shortening of the G1 phase and faster S phase entry (15Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 16Sexl V. Diehl J.A. Sherr C.J. Ashmun R. Beach D. Roussel M.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Cdc25A and -B, but not C have been found to be overexpressed in a subset of aggressive human cancers (17Galaktionov K. Lee A.K. Eckstein J. Draetta G. Meckler J. Loda M. Beach D.

Kemp B.L. Walsh G. Mao L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4082-4085PubMed Google Scholar). The p53 tumor suppressor mediates DNA damage-induced G1 arrest, but has little or no effect on S or G2 arrest. Consequently, while normal cells mainly arrest in G1 in response to genotoxic stress, p53-null tumor cells are defective in G1 arrest. This leads to increased genetic instability in tumor cells, which further reinforces the tumorigenic process. On the other hand, tumor cells with p53-dependent G1 checkpoint deficiency rely more on the S or G2 checkpoint to repair their damaged DNA and preserve their essential genomic integrity for basic viability when treated with radiation or DNA-damaging drugs. Therefore, by specifically abrogating the G2 checkpoint, normal cells can still arrest in the G1 phase and repair the DNA damage; whereas, tumor cells that lack the G1 checkpoint will undergo mitotic catastrophe and eventually undergo apoptosis. These differences may confer a selective cytotoxicity in the tumor versus normal cells (20Powell S. DeFrank J. Connell P. Eogan M. Preffer F. Dombkowski D. Tang W. Friend S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar, 21Koniaras K. Cuddihy A. Christopoulos H. Hogg A. O'Connell M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7453-7463Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Because of its prominent role in the DNA damage-induced G2 checkpoint, Chk1 has become an attractive target for this approach, and Chk1 inhibitors are being developed to potentiate the effects of genotoxic chemotherapeutics on p53-null tumors. Herein we demonstrate that camptothecin and doxorubicin, two DNA-damaging agents that cause S or G2 arrest, respectively, activate Chk1 and cause the rapid proteolysis of Cdc25A. Elimination of Chk1 expression through siRNA not only abrogated the S or G2 arrest, but also protected Cdc25A from degradation. These results suggest that Chk1 mediates the S or G2 phase checkpoints by targeting Cdc25A for proteolysis following chemically induced DNA damage. This study indicates that a Chk1 inhibitor may potentiate the cytotoxicity not only of DNA-damaging drugs causing G2 arrest, but also of agents conferring S arrest, which significantly broadens its applicability to cancer chemotherapy. Our results additionally demonstrate that Cdc25A plays functional roles not only in the G1/S transition but also in G2/M progression. This later conclusion is supported by our observation that both Cdc25A and Cdc25C overexpression can overcome the Chk1-mediated G2/M arrest induced by doxorubicin in a dose-dependent manner. Cell Culture—Human lung cancer cell line H1299 was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). H1299 were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.45% glucose at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Antibodies—Cdc25A was detected with NeoMarker monoclonal anti-cdc25A antibody C-3 (Lab Vision, CA). Chk1 was detected with Chk1 (G-4) monoclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cdc25C was detected by Cd25C (C-20) polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Phospho-Chk1 (S345P) was detected by phospho-Chk1 (Ser-345) antibody from Cell Signaling Technology. Transfection—Human Chk1 siRNA and scrambled control siRNA were designed according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Dharmacon Research). Chk1 siRNA oligonucleotide contains the following sequence: aactgaagaagcagtcgcagt. The scrambled siRNA derived from Chk1 siRNA contains sequence: aacaagtgaagcagtcgcagt. For siRNA transfection alone, H1299 cells were seeded at 2.5 × 105 cells/well into a 6-well plate with 2 ml of medium in each well. The next day, the cells were transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides with OligofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the vendor's instructions with slight modifications. Briefly, 10 μl of siRNA at 20 μm was mixed with 140 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) to obtain solution A. In solution B, 10 μl of OligofectAMINE was added to 40 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then, solutions A and B were mixed together and allowed to incubate for 20–30 min and then added to each well containing 2 ml of the medium in a 6-well plate. For co-transfection of Chk1 siRNA with Cdc25A-expression plasmid, 10 μl of siRNA with 0.1 μg of the plasmid were added to 0.1 ml of Opti-MEM to obtain solution A. In solution B, 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) was added to 100 μl of Opti-MEM and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Then, solutions A and B were combined, allowed to incubate for 20–30 min, and then added to each well. Drug Treatment—DNA-damaging agent-induced Cdc25A degradation was carried out with the following treatment regimens: for camptothecin, either 3 μm for 3–6hor0.2–0.3 μm for 18–24 h (both achieved similar results); for doxorubicin, 0.5 μm for 18–24 h. Western Blot Analysis—Cultured cells were rinsed with PBS and directly lysed in Laemmli sample buffer supplemented with 0.05% of β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 200 nm okadaic acid, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Lysed samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved on the Novex mini-gel system (Invitrogen) under denaturing conditions and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer device (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and probed with antibodies. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using ECL reagents according to the vendor's protocols (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cell Cycle Analysis—Medium in the cell culture wells was collected before the cells were washed once with PBS to gather all of the cells including floating cells. The cells were then trypsinized and added to the tube with the medium. After spinning for 5 min at 1000 × g, the cells were washed one time in PBS and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed again twice with PBS and treated with RNase A at 37 °C for 30 min. Finally, the cells were stained with propidium iodide and incubated in the dark for 60 min or overnight before analysis. The samples were analyzed through flow cytometry using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) manufactured by BD Bioscience (San Jose, CA). A total of 10,000 cells were counted for each sample. Gating of cell population and quantitation of the cells were performed using the CellQuest program provided by the vendor. Because few cells in the studies had more than 4N of DNA contents, four populations of the cells were analyzed including the apoptotic cells (or sub G0/G1 population) at the sub-2N position, the G0/G1 population at 2N position, the G2/M cells at the 4N position, and the S phase cells between 2N and 4N. To ensure the correct identification of each cell population and detection of apoptotic cells, each experiment also contained a Taxol-treated sample to confirm apoptosis and G2/M cells and a thymidine-treated sample to verify cells in the S phase. For detection of DNA synthesis in the S phase, H1299 cells were transfected with siRNA on day one. The next day, cells were treated with 125 nm camptothecin for 6 h followed by pulse labeling the cells with 10 μm BrdUrd for 20 min before the samples were processed for FACS analysis. Detection of BrdUrd label and DNA contents were performed using the BrdUrd kit (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's manual. Camptothecin Induces Phosphorylation of Chk1 and Cdc25A Degradation, Resulting in S Phase Arrest—It was previously reported that Cdc25A undergoes proteolysis upon IR or UV irradiation (1Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 2Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nature. 2001; 410: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar), which induce G2 or G1 arrest, respectively. To investigate if this finding can be extended to DNA damage-induced arrest at other phases of the cell cycle, we studied the effect of camptothecin, a clinically relevant topoisomerase I inhibitor conferring S phase arrest. H1299 cells, a p53-null lung cancer cell line, were treated with or without camptothecin and harvested for Western blot analysis of Cdc25A, Chk1 protein levels, and cell cycle profiles. Cdc25A almost completely disappeared after the treatment (Fig. 1A, compare lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2), whereas its close homologue, Cdc25C, did not show any change in protein levels. The disappearance of Cdc25A is because of proteasome-mediated degradation, because incubation of cells with MG132, a specific proteasome inhibitor, abrogated this phenomenon (data not shown). Although the amount of Chk1 protein remained constant before and after drug treatment, the ATR-phosphorylated Chk1 species (Chk1 S345P) appeared only after camptothecin addition (lanes 3 and 4), indicating Chk1 activation in response to camptothecin-induced DNA damage. We additionally confirmed that cells treated with camptothecin were mostly arrested in S phase (Fig. 3B and data not shown), further suggesting that Chk1 may mediate S checkpoint by targeting Cdc25A for proteolysis.Fig. 3Chk1 mediates both S and G2 checkpoints.A, Chk1 mediates doxorubicin-induced G2 checkpoints. FACS analysis was performed for H1299 cells transfected with Chk1 scrRNA or siRNA, treated with or without 500 nm doxorubicin for 24 h. Differentially gated cell populations were counted and their percentage in the total cell populations calculated.

H1299 cells were transfected with siRNA or scrRNA control on day one. The next day, cells were treated with (Camp., bottom panels) or without (No Camp., upper panels) 125 nm camptothecin for 6 h followed by pulse labeling with 10 μm BrdUrd for 20 min. The cells were then processed for FACS analysis. BrdUrd-positive cells in S phase were counted and the corresponding percentage in the total cell population was calculated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Doxorubicin Induces Phosphorylation of Chk1 and Cdc25A Degradation, Resulting in G2/M Arrest—We also studied the effect of doxorubicin, a clinically relevant topoisomerase II inhibitor conferring G2 arrest on different cancer cell lines including H1299 cells (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Similar to camptothecin, doxorubicin caused rapid degradation of Cdc25A while leaving Cdc25C mostly intact, which can be correlated to the phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 upon drug treatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, different DNA-damaging agents, which cause arrests at different phases of the cell cycle, lead to simultaneous Chk1 activation and Cdc25A degradation. These observations are not specific to H1299 cells, because similar findings were also obtained from other cell lines including SW620 and HCT-15 (data not shown). Chk1 Mediates the Proteolysis of Cdc25A in Response to Camptothecin and Doxorubicin—To confirm the direct involvement of Chk1 in the DNA damage-induced proteolysis of Cdc25A, we designed an siRNA that specifically eliminated Chk1 expression. Chk1 siRNA or the scrambled control RNA (scrRNA) were transfected into H1299 cells that were subsequently subjected to the same camptothecin treatment (Fig. 2A). For scrRNA, we again observed the efficient proteolysis of Cdc25A in response to camptothecin at both 3- and 6-h time points (lanes 1–3). In contrast, with transfection of the Chk1 siRNA, the proteolysis of Cdc25A was significantly inhibited (lanes 4–6). The identity of the indicated Cdc25A band was confirmed by its exact co-migration with overexpressed Cdc25A protein (data not shown; also see Fig. 2B). The Chk1 immunoblot confirms the effective elimination of the Chk1 protein by the Chk1 siRNA but not the scrRNA. This result established that Chk1 mediates the degradation of endogenous Cdc25A in response to camptothecin treatment. To further confirm this observation, we ectopically expressed Cdc25A in H1299 cells. When Cdc25A is moderately overexpressed (about 3–5-fold over endogenous level), camptothecin still induces the efficient proteolysis of Cdc25A (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). However, with Chk1 siRNA, this degradation was essentially abrogated (lanes 4–6). In fact, the steady-state level of Cdc25A was greatly increased (by 3–5-fold, compare lanes 1 and 4), indicating that under these conditions Chk1 also negatively regulates the level of Cdc25A even in the absence of any DNA damage. To ascertain whether Chk1 also directly mediates doxorubicin-induced Cdc25A degradation, we treated H1299 cells with doxorubicin at 500 nm overnight to induce the proteolysis of Cdc25A. With Chk1 scrRNA transfection, this process remains intact (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, the Chk1 siRNA greatly inhibited this clearance (lanes 1 and 2). These results suggest that Chk1 targets Cdc25A for degradation in response to both doxorubicin and camptothecin. Chk1 Mediates both S and G2Checkpoints—To investigate whether Chk1 is involved in the doxorubicin-induced G2 checkpoint, we analyzed the cell cycle profile of H1299 cells in the presence of doxorubicin with or without the elimination of Chk1 via siRNA. When cells transfected with scrRNA were treated with doxorubicin for 24 h, we observed a dramatic increase in the G2/M peak (19–79%), indicating the induction of the G2 checkpoint (Fig. 3A, profiles 1 and 2). However, when Chk1 expression is eliminated via the Chk1-specific siRNA, the extent of G2/M arrest was significantly reduced (28%, Fig. 3A, profile 4), indicating that Chk1 is directly responsible for the doxorubicin-conferred G2 checkpoint. Additionally, we observed a large increase of apoptotic (M1 phase, sub-G0/G1) cells in doxorubicin-treated Chk1-deficient cells (14% in profile 4 versus 1% in profile 2), suggesting that abrogation of the checkpoint by Chk1 knockdown induced extensive cell death. In contrast to its role in the G2 checkpoint, the involvement of Chk1 in S phase arrest is not as widely accepted. To convincingly demonstrate the role of Chk1 in S checkpoint, we carried out a BrdUrd labeling experiment with camptothecin-treated H1299 cells to better characterize the expected S phase arrest. First, in the absence of camptothecin, there were no differences in the labeling profiles among mock transfected cells, cells transfected with Chk1 siRNA, and cells transfected with scrRNA (Fig. 3B, upper panels). With camptothecin treatment, we noticed a dramatic decrease in BrdUrd labeling of the S phase cells in either mock or scrRNA-transfected cells (33 to 1, and 28 to 1%, respectively), consistent with the drug-induced S phase arrest. However, Chk1 siRNA transfection effectively maintained the DNA synthesis rate (27 to 21%) even in the presence of DNA damage, demonstrating abrogation of the arrest and further indicating that Chk1 also mediates camptothecin-induced S checkpoint. Chk1 immunoblot was performed to confirm the elimination of Chk1 protein by the siRNA (data not shown). The Function of Cdc25A in G2/M Transition—So far, we have shown the Chk1 mediates Cdc25A degradation and arrests cells in either S or G2/M when induced by DNA-damaging agents. To further confirm that Cdc25A plays a role in G2/M transition in addition to its more widely accepted function in G1/S progression, we studied the cell cycle profiles of H1299 cells transiently transfected with increasing amounts of expression plasmids encoding either Cdc25A or Cdc25C (Fig. 4A). The cells were treated with doxorubicin to induce G2 arrest; FACS analysis was performed to determine whether Cdc25 overexpression could abrogate the DNA damage-induced G2 arrest. Control cells in the absence of doxorubicin showed a normal predominant distribution in G1 phase and a relatively minor G2/M population (right profile, panel 1). In contrast, doxorubicin-treated cells exhibited a large increase of the G2/M peak, indicating G2 arrest (left profile, panel 1). With Cdc25C overexpression (panel 2), we observed a dose-dependent abrogation of the G2 arrest starting at the second dose (100 ng/well transfection), consistent with its published role in promoting G2/M phase progression through dephosphorylation of Cdc2 (7Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). In comparison, Cdc25A overexpression (panel 3) also conferred a similar abrogation of the G2 arrest in a dose-dependent manner starting with the second dose (100 ng/well transfection), indicating that Cdc25A mediates G2/M transition with similar efficacy as Cdc25C. As a control, transfection of cells with increasing amounts of empty vector did not confer any abrogation (data not shown). To confirm the overexpression of Cdc25A in the above experiment and further investigate the underlying mechanism of the observed abrogation of G2 arrest, we subjected the same cell samples to immunoblot analysis for Cdc25A and Cdc2/Cdk1 (Fig. 4B). Because Cdc2 is the kinase directly responsible for G2/M transition, and its dephosphorylation at tyrosine 15 by Cdc25C has been shown to cause its activation and M phase progression (6Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), we speculated that it might also be the downstream target of Cdc25A. Transfection of 50 ng of the Cdc25A plasmid generated a weak Cdc25A signal, which disappeared after doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4), indicating Chk1-mediated degradation in response to DNA damage. In contrast, transfection with 200 and 500 ng of the plasmid conferred significantly higher amounts of Cdc25A, and more importantly, the overexpressed Cdc25A became mostly resistant to drug-induced proteolysis (lanes 5–8). Correspondingly, 200 and 500 ng but not the 50-ng transfection of Cdc25A efficiently decreased the doxorubicin-induced phosphorylation of Cdc2 at tyrosine 15 (Cdc2 Y15P), suggesting that Cdc25A activates Cdc2 through direct dephosphorylation of Cdc2 Y15P. Total Cdc2 protein levels did not show significant variation among the different samples (data not shown). The 500-ng transfection conferred higher Cdc25A accumulation than the 200-ng transfection, resulting in more complete elimination of Cdc2 Y15P signal (compare lanes 6 and 8), in line with its more complete abrogation of the G2 arrest (Fig. 4A). As a negative control, transfection of 500 ng of a plasmid expressing Cdc25A C430S, a phosphatase-dead inactive mutant (15Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), also resulted in doxorubicin-resistant accumulation of Cdc25A to a level that is even higher than transfection with same amount of wild type construct (compare lanes 9 and 10 and 7 and 8). However, this mutant Cdc25A is unable to dephosphorylate Cdc2 and decrease the Cdc2 Y15P signal, thus confirming that the phosphatase activity of Cdc25A is required for Cdc2 activation. Cdc2 total protein level was also studied for this experiment and found to be mostly constant among the different samples (data not shown). Fig. 4C shows Cdc25C overexpression-induced dephosphorylation of Cdc2. Similar to Cdc25A, Cdc25C overexpression also led to a decrease in the Cdc2 Y15P signal in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that Cdc25C abrogates DNA damage-induced G2/M arrest via re-activation of Cdc2 through its dephosphorylation. This corroborates previous reports showing that Cdc2 is a direct downstream target of Cdc25C. Chk1 was proposed to play a role in the S or G2 checkpoints induced by various DNA-damaging agents including UV, IR, and topoisomerase I inhibitors (1Mailand N. Falck J. Lukas C. Syljuasen R.G. Welcker M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Science. 2000; 288: 1425-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 4Zhou B.B. Elledge S.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1598-1603PubMed Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that in normal human fibroblasts (MJ90) and also in fibroblasts derived from patients with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), Chk1 is expressed specifically at the S to M phase of the cell cycle at both the RNA and protein levels and its activity is readily detected at the S to M phase of the cell cycle (23Kaneko Y.S. Watanabe N. Morisaki H. Akita H. Fujimoto A. Tominaga K. Terasawa M. Tachibana A. Ikeda K. Nakanishi M. Kaneko Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3673-3681Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the direct involvement of Chk1 in these processes have not been convincingly demonstrated and the underlying mechanisms for these checkpoints still remain controversial. We report here that Cdc25A protein undergoes Chk1-mediated degradation in response to various DNA-damaging drugs, and this degradation coincides with and determines the resultant S or G2 checkpoints. Therefore, Chk1 elimination through siRNA leads to abrogation of both Cdc25A proteolysis and the S or G2 checkpoints. During the final preparation stage of this article, a new report appeared showing that Cdc25A is subject to Chk1-mediated proteolysis in response to double-stranded DNA breaks generated by IR (24Zhao H. Watkins J.L. Piwnica-Worms H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14795-14800Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This contradicts a previous study that demonstrated that Chk2, not Chk1, is primarily responsible for mediating IR-induced Cdc25A degradation (25Falck J. Petrini J.H. Williams B.R. Lukas J. Bartek J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this study, we focused on two major topoisomerase inhibitors (camptothecin and doxorubicin), the mainstay of cancer chemotherapy. Camptothecin is the most commonly used first-line and second-line treatment for colon cancer, whereas doxorubicin is widely used to combat breast, stomach, and cervical cancers (26Hurley L.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Because IR and topoisomerase inhibitors confer DNA damage through different mechanisms (see below), they may activate distinct signal transduction pathways. The mechanism of cell cycle arrest by the topoisomerase inhibitors has not been clearly established. This lack of theoretical guidance has seriously impeded the improvement of current chemotherapy and rational design of next generation chemotherapeutics. Our study directly addressed this urgent issue by demonstrating that camptothecin and doxorubicin induce different cell cycle checkpoints (S and G2) through the same process of targeting Cdc25A to degradation through Chk1, and Chk1 inhibition greatly potentiates their cytotoxicity. Therefore, combined with previous studies, we have shown that the checkpoint kinases respond to a wide variety of DNA insults by targeting Cdc25A to proteolysis and triggering checkpoints at different stages of the cell cycle. Cdc25A Mediates G2/M Progression in Addition to G1/S Transition—Cdc25A is usually considered a promoter of G1/S transition through its dephosphorylation and activation of Cdk2 kinase (9Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar, 15Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, we have determined that Cdc25A also undergoes rapid proteolysis in response to both S and G2 checkpoints; and disruption of this degradation, through either elimination of Chk1 (Fig. 3) or Cdc25A overexpression (Fig. 4), essentially abrogated the checkpoints. This suggests that Cdc25A functions in both S phase progression and G2/M transition. The latter point is further supported by several previous studies: (a) a potent Cdc25A inhibitor arrests synchronized cells at both G1 and G2/M, and blocked dephosphorylation of both Cdk2 and Cdc2/Cdk1 (27Pu L. Amoscato A.A. Bier M.E. Lazo J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46877-46885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); (b) microinjection of Cdc25A antibodies interferes with mitosis (9Galaktionov K. Beach D. Cell. 1991; 67: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); and (c) Cdc25A has been found to be active throughout all stages of the cell cycle (13Hoffmann I. Draetta G. Karsenti E. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar, 15Blomberg I. Hoffmann I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6183-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Cdc25C is a well known mediator of G2/M transition through its activation of Cdc2 (6Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 7Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). However, it may not be the only mediator of this process because Cdc25C-null mice are viable and do not display any obvious abnormalities. Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of Cdc2, the timing of entry into mitosis, and the cellular response to DNA damage were unperturbed in mouse embryo fibroblasts lacking Cdc25C, indicating that Cdc25A and/or Cdc25B may compensate for loss of Cdc25C in the mouse (28Chen M.S. Hurov J. White L.S. Woodford-Thomas T. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3853-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Our current study provides additional evidence that overexpression of Cdc25A could overcome G2 arrest as efficiently as that of Cdc25C through dephosphorylation of Cdc2, strengthening the notion that Cdc2 is also a downstream target of Cdc25A (Fig. 4). Moreover, doxorubicin simultaneously induces G2 arrest and Cdc25A degradation without showing any effect on Cdc25C level (Figs. 1 and 2). These all suggest that Cdc25A may be a more critical and ubiquitous cell cycle regulator than Cdc25C, and the Chk1/Cdc25A pathway mediates both S and G2 checkpoints. Cdc25A and Cdc25C May Be Both Required for G2/M Progression—When cells enter mitosis, there is a dramatic increase of cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase activity, which is required for early stage mitotic progression (29Nigg E.A. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). To maintain this requisite level of Cdc2 kinase activity, a sustained pool of Cdc25 phosphatase activity may be necessary. As mentioned previously, among the three Cdc25 members, Cdc25B is regarded as an “initiator” phosphatase that is primarily responsible for creating the first stimulation of cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase activity to set in motion the mitotic process (11Gabrielli B.G. De Souza C.P. Tonks I.D. Clark J.M. Hayward N.K. Ellem K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1081-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Lammer C. Wagerer S. Saffrich R. Mertens D. Ansorge W. Hoffmann I. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, CDC25B is an unstable protein with a short half-life (30Nishijima H. Nishitani H. Seki T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1105-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and it is degraded in a proteasome-dependent manner upon M phase entry (31Baldin V. Cans C. Knibiehler M. Ducommun B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32731-32734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Thus the burden of maintaining the active cyclin B-Cdc2 kinase falls to the other members of the family, namely Cdc25A and Cdc25C. We hypothesize that the endogenous level of each protein is insufficient to sustain the necessary threshold of Cdc2 kinase activity, thus the presence of both are required for proper M phase progression. As shown in Fig. 4, this dual requirement can be clearly circumvented by the transient overexpression of either Cdc25A or Cdc25C. As discussed above, Cdc25C knockout cells show little mitotic abnormalities (28Chen M.S. Hurov J. White L.S. Woodford-Thomas T. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3853-3861Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This does not mean that Cdc25C normally plays no role in G2/M progression. It only means that Cdc25C is not essential for this process. Apparently other members of the Cdc25 family are able to compensate for its loss. We speculate that in Cdc25C-null cells, Cdc25A may undergo certain kinds of up-regulation, either at the mRNA or protein levels, or at the phosphatase activity level through post-translational modifications, to still maintain a normal pool of Cdc25 phosphatase activity. Will Different DNA-damaging Agents, Especially Topoisomerase Inhibitors, All Induce Cdc25A Degradation?—Previously it was reported that hydroxyurea, an antimetabolite-inducing S phase arrest, also stimulated Cdc25A degradation (32Molinari M. Mercurio C. Dominguez J. Goubin F. Draetta G.F. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). We showed here that camptothecin, a topoisomerase I poison conferring S arrest, induces the same process specifically through Chk1. It is not clear what distinguishes these two phenotypically different forms of S checkpoint. It will be interesting to know whether the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin, causing S phase arrest through yet another mechanism, also leads to Cdc25A proteolysis. IR generates DNA damage through creating double-stranded DNA breaks, this process does not directly involve topoisomerase. In contrast, camptothecin and doxorubicin induce DNA damage through inhibition of topoisomerase I and II, respectively. Topoisomerases regulate DNA architecture by sustaining the correct DNA superhelicity and resolving intertwined DNA strands, particularly during DNA replication. Topoisomerase I generates single-stranded breaks, whereas topoisomerase II creates double-stranded breaks. The cytotoxicity of their inhibitors generally stems from the stabilization of topoisomerase-DNA covalent cleavage intermediates (also known as cleavage complexes). Besides camptothecin and doxorubicin, other clinically effective drugs acting in this manner include topotecan and SN-38 (topoisomerase I) as well as mitoxantrone and etoposide (topoisomerase II) (26Hurley L.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to ascertain whether we can extend our current findings to the other topoisomerase poisons. If yes, this will further broaden the utility of Chk1 inhibitors in the potentiation of cancer chemotherapies. In conclusion, our results showed that the Chk1/Cdc25A pathway mediates both S and G2 checkpoints. This finding defines Chk1 as a more ubiquitous cell cycle checkpoint mediator and hence significantly broadens the application of Chk1 inhibitor in the potentiation of various cancer chemotherapeutics."

Such protease complexes in bacteria and yeast are systems that undergo a highly sophisticated network of gene expression regulation. However, regulation of mammalian proteasome gene expression has been neglected so far as a possible control mechanism for the amount of proteasomes in the cell. Here, we show that treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors and the concomitant impairment of proteasomal enzyme activity induce a transient and concerted up-regulation of all mammalian 26 S proteasome subunit mRNAs. Proteasome inhibition in combination with inhibition of transcription revealed that the observed up-regulation is mediated by coordinated transcriptional activation of the proteasome genes and not by post-transcriptional events. Our experiments also demonstrate that inhibitor-induced proteasome gene activation results in enhanced de novo protein synthesis of all subunits and in increased de novo formation of proteasomes. This phenomenon is accompanied by enhanced expression of the proteasome maturation factor POMP. Thus, our experiments present the first evidence that the amount of proteasomes in mammalia is regulated at the transcriptional level and that there exists an autoregulatory feedback mechanism that allows the compensation of reduced proteasome activity.

To ensure protein homeostasis ATP-dependent proteases play a crucial role in all organisms. The molecular architecture of such protease complexes in pro- and eukaryotes is similar in that they form multi subunit ring structures. In principle, they are composed of a proteolytic core subcomplex performing peptide hydrolysis and a regulatory subcomplex responsible for substrate recognition, unfolding, and providing accessibility to the proteolytic active sites (1Coux O. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 29: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic 20 S proteasome core complexes consist of four staggered heptameric rings of 14 nonidentical but homologous subunits. The outer rings contain α type subunits having a gating function for substrate entrance and product release (3Groll M. Bajorek M. Kohler A. Moroder L. Rubin D.M. Huber R. Glickman M.H. Finley D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1062-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Only three of the seven β type subunits in the inner rings exhibit peptide hydrolyzing activity and form the six proteolytic active threonine sites (4Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). The 19 S regulatory complex binds to the 20 S catalytic core unit via a substructure called the “base,” which is composed of six ATPases of the AAA family plus two non-ATPase subunits (1Coux O. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 2002; 29: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 2Kloetzel P.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The ATPases exert a chaperone-like activity and are believed to unfold substrates and channel them into the 20 S core, thereby controlling access of substrates to the proteolytic chamber (5Braun B.C. Glickman M. Kraft R. Dahlmann B. Kloetzel P.M. Finley D. Schmidt M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 6Strickland E. Hakala K. Thomas P.J. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5565-5572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The residual non-ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulator form a “lid” structure that is thought to possess regulatory functions. In eukaryotic cells, the 26 S proteasome is the most important ATP-dependent proteolytic system recognizing its substrates via a multi-ubiquitin tag. In bacteria, such systems are exemplified by various kinds of Clp proteases (7Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8318-8320Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The complex processes of eukaryotic proteasome biogenesis comprise three main steps that finally lead to the formation of active proteolytic complexes (8Kruger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The first step is the biosynthesis of seven different α type and the proforms of seven different β type 20 S core subunits. All of these proteins assemble into various stages of proteasome precursor complexes. Two distinct precursor intermediates can be distinguished: the 13 and 16 S precursor complexes. It is thought that two 16 S complexes interact to form a large and probably short-lived precursor intermediate, where the final maturation steps take place (8Kruger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 9Schmidt M. Kloetzel P.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1235-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). With the exception of β3/C10 and β4/C7, all proteasomal β subunits are synthesized as inactive proproteins with N-terminal propeptides. These propeptides play an essential role during the biogenesis process and are processed by cis- or trans-autocatalysis in a two-step mechanism (10Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S. Henklein P. Frommel C. Lowe J. Huber R. Kloetzel P.M. Schmidt M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6887-6898Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The propeptides of the active β subunits are cleaved off autocatalytically, whereas the propeptides of the inactive subunits are removed by their active neighbors (10Schmidtke G. Kraft R. Kostka S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In eukaryotes, proteasome formation is assisted by accessory proteins that support the final assembly steps. One factor playing a crucial role in proteasome maturation is the short-lived protein Ump1 of yeast. Ump1 is part of proteasome precursor complexes and is degraded upon completion of proteasome maturation (14Ramos P.C. Hockendorff J. Johnson E.S. Varshavsky A. Dohmen R.J. Cell. 1998; 92: 489-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Mammalian Ump1 homologues have been identified in 16 S precursor complexes and are referred to as POMP (proteasome maturation protein), proteassemblin, or human/mouse UMP (8Kruger E. Kloetzel P.M. Enenkel C. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Griffin T.A. Slack J.P. McCluskey T.S. Monaco J.J. Colbert R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 10348-10353Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Gene expression of ATP-dependent proteolysis systems is strongly regulated in bacteria. Thus, genes encoding Clp proteases in Gram-positive bacteria are negatively controlled by a repressor that is degraded by the ClpCP protease under inducing conditions resulting in a positive autoregulatory feedback loop (18Kruger E. Zuhlke D. Witt E. Ludwig H. Hecker M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 852-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, such a mechanism of self-control was shown for σ32 activating gene expression of Clp proteases (19Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 20Missiakas D. Schwager F. Betton J.M. Georgopoulos C. Raina S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6899-6909Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Indications for a coordinated control of proteasomal gene expression also exist in eukaryotes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, genes encoding proteasomal subunits are proceeded by a common upstream activating cis-element, the so-called proteasome-associated control element. This proteasome-associated control element serves as a target sequence for the transcription factor Rpn4 that activates proteasomal gene expression in a concerted manner (21Mannhaupt G. Schnall R. Karpov V. Vetter I. Feldmann H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Rpn4 is essentially required to control balanced levels of proteasomal subunits and thereby for balanced intracellular proteolysis. Interestingly, the extremely short-lived Rpn4 protein is not only a transcriptional regulator for the 26 S proteasome but also becomes a substrate of the 26 S proteasome. Such a regulatory mechanism yields in a negative feedback circuit in yeast. The same protein that controls and induces proteasome formation is destroyed by the fully assembled and matured proteasome (22Xie Y. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3056-3061Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). More recently, transcriptional profiling revealed a concerted Rpn4-dependent upregulation of all proteasomal subunits upon treatment with proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that Rpn4 is indeed a master regulator responsible for the ability of the cell to compensate for proteasome inhibition (23Fleming J.A. Lightcap E.S. Sadis S. Thoroddsen V. Bulawa C.E. Blackman R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1461-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Moreover, a probably similar system was found in Drosophila where proteasomal activity was inhibited by the silencing of different proteasomal genes. This approach not only resulted in reduced expression of the targeted subunit but also in increased expression of several nontargeted proteasomal subunits. However, the details of this regulation mechanism in Drosophila seem to be different from that in yeast (24Wojcik C. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6188-6197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although regulated gene expression is also an essential prerequisite and the initial step in mammalian proteasome formation, the knowledge available on its regulation is still very limited. In this study, we therefore investigated the expression pattern of genes encoding proteasome subunits in response to proteasome inhibitors in mammalian cells. Moreover, we analyzed the effect of proteasome inhibitors on de novo formation of proteasome complexes. Our data present the first experimental evidence that mammalian cells respond to impairment of cellular proteasomal enzyme activity by a coordinated up-regulation of proteasome subunits at both the transcriptional and translational level. In consequence, mammalian cells compensate proteasome inhibition by de novo proteasome formation. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that mammalian cells must possess a sensor that by a so far unknown mechanism is able to tightly control the level of active cellular proteasomes.

The fluorogenic peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-aminomethyl-coumarin (AMC) was from Bachem. Antibodies against p53 (polyclonal antibody 240) and Hsp70 (K29) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-ubiquitin antibody was from DAKO. Antibodies against proteasomes and proteasomal subunits were purchased from Affinity (Rpt1/MSS1, and C2/α6), and other anti-proteasome antisera and the anti-POMP antibody are laboratory stock and have been described previously (15Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—Primary cultures of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were prepared from carotids of Wistar rats and cultivated as described elsewhere (25Meiners S. Laule M. Rother W. Guenther C. Prauka I. Muschick P. Baumann G. Kloetzel P.M. Stangl K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Purity of VSMC preparations was confirmed to be 95% by immunostaining with anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich). VSMCs were synchronized by replacing the growth medium with medium containing 2% fetal calf serum for 24 h. For all experiments the cells were used between passages 3 and 12. Other mammalian cell lines were cultivated under standard conditions (15Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For treatment with proteasome inhibitors, the culture media were supplemented with either epoxomicin (3 μm) or c-lactacystin, MG132, ALLM in concentrations from 0.05 to 10 μm, or 0.1% Me2SO as a solvent control for the times indicated. For transcriptional inhibition VSMCs were treated for 8 h with 50 μg/ml α-amanitin to block transcription, and 1 μm MG132 was added for the last 6 h to induce mRNA levels of exemplified proteasomal subunits. Subsequently, the cells were harvested for RNA isolation or for preparation of total protein lysates. Real Time RT-PCR and Northern Blotting—Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). 500 ng of RNA was DNase-digested (Ambion) and reverse transcribed with murine Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The PCR primers to amplify rat proteasomal cDNAs and the housekeeping gene hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase were purchased from TIB MOLBIOL. The SYBR Green method was applied for quantitative amplification of the cDNA of rat proteasomal subunits using real time PCR. PCR amplification was carried out in 25 μl of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems) containing either 0.3 or 0.9 μm primer, and 0.4 μl of the reverse transcription reaction in a 5700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems). Thermal cycling conditions comprised activation of uracil-N-glycosylase at 50 °C for 2 min, an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min for 40 cycles. The Ct (threshold cycle) is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescence signal to exceed the detection threshold. mRNA expression was standardized to hypoxanthine phosphoryribosyl transferase gene as a housekeeping gene, the transcription level of which was not influenced under our experimental conditions. Expression of the target gene relative to the housekeeping gene was calculated as the difference between the threshold values of the two genes (2–Δct). Expression of proteasomal genes in the presence of proteasome inhibitor was normalized to expression under control conditions (0.1% Me2SO) by means of the comparative Ct method (2–ΔΔct). The values are given as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. For Northern Blots 3 μg of total RNA isolated as described above were loaded, vacuum-blotted, and hybridized overnight with digoxygenin-labeled riboprobes of PSMA2, PSMB5, PSMC2, and POMP. The gel loading was equalized using ethidium bromide staining of 28 S rRNA. The denaturing gel electrophoresis, vacuum blotting, and chemiluminescence detection were performed as described earlier (26Kruger E. Msadek T. Hecker M. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 713-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting and Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—Equal amounts of protein extract were separated on SDS-Laemmli gels, transferred by electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and immunodetected with specific antibodies as described (25Meiners S. Laule M. Rother W. Guenther C. Prauka I. Muschick P. Baumann G. Kloetzel P.M. Stangl K. Circulation. 2002; 105: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 4 mg of protein of total cell extracts were fractionated by size gradient ultracentrifugation and immunodetected as described (15Witt E. Zantopf D. Schmidt M. Kraft R. Kloetzel P.M. Kruger E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Metabolic 35S Labeling—VSMC cells were incubated for 8 h with 10 μm c-lactacystin, ALLM, or 0.1% Me2SO as controls and then pulsed with 35S translabel for 6 or 16 h, respectively. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Equal counts were used for immunoprecipitation processed with an anti-proteasome antibody as described (27Frentzel S. Pesold-Hurt B. Seelig A. Kloetzel P.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The radioactive protein pattern was detected by phosphorimaging (Fuji FLA3000), and the band intensities were evaluated by the AIDA software according to the manufacturer's instructions (Raytest). Measurement of Proteasome Activity in Cellular Lysates and Cell Viability Assay—Chymotryptic activity of the proteasome was assessed in cell lysates of VSMCs using the synthetic peptide substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr linked to the fluorometric reporter AMC. The cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor (0.05–10 μm) or Me2SO (0.1%) for different time periods, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed under hypoosmotic conditions by repeated freezing and thawing in liquid nitrogen (28Loda M. Cukor B. Tam S.W. Lavin P. Fiorentino M. Draetta G.F. Jessup J.M. Pagano M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). After centrifugation supernatants were used for determination of protein concentration and enzymatic activity. The lysates were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in incubation buffer containing an ATP-regenerating system (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 18 mm KCl, 3 mm Mg(CH3COO)2, 3 mm MgCl2, 1.1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm ATP, 5 mm phosphokreatin, 0.2 unit of phosphokreatinkinase) and 0.2 mm Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr AMC. AMC hydrolysis was quantitated in a BioTek FLx800 plate reader using 360-nm excitation and 460-nm emission wavelengths. Enzymatic activity was normalized to protein concentration and expressed as a percentage of activity of control lysates. The values are given as the means of three independent experiments ± S.D. Cell viability was tested after 8 h of inhibition using Cell Proliferation Kit II according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Proteasome Subunits Are Up-regulated in Response to Cellular Proteasome Inhibition—A first indication that proteasome inhibitor treatment of mammalian cells may affect the levels of proteasome mRNAs was obtained by gene expression profiling. Using a commercially available cDNA microarray (BD Biosciences), we observed a 2–3-fold up-regulation of several genes encoding proteasome subunits, i.e. α2/PSMA2, α4/PSMA7, α6/PSMA1, β1/PSMB6, β3/PSMB3, β4/PSMB2, and β7/PSMB4, in response to proteasome inhibition with c-lactacystin and MG132 (data not shown). To investigate whether such an increased expression of various subunits can also be detected by Northern or Western blot analysis primary VSMCs of the rat were treated with 10 μm c-lactacystin, 10 μm MG132, or Me2SO for 6 h. Northern blot analysis of the α-subunit α2/PSMA2, the catalytic β-subunit β5/PSMB5, and the ATPase Rpt1/PSMC2 revealed a distinct up-regulation of these proteasome subunits in response to c-lactacystin and MG132 (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis showed that increased proteasome mRNA levels were paralleled by increased protein levels because treatment of VSMCs with c-lactacystin and MG132 for 8 h resulted in enhanced levels of α6/C2, Rpt1/MSS1, and β1/δ subunits (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, cells treated with proteasome inhibitors also showed expression of the β1/δ proprotein, indicating that the enhanced levels of proteasome subunits are due to de novo protein synthesis and not the result of protein stabilization. In contrast, treatment of VSMCs with the nonproteasomal, calpain-specific inhibitor ALLM, which is structurally similar to the peptide aldehyde inhibitor MG132, did not result in increased expression of proteasomal subunits (Fig. 1B). To see whether the observed effect is a cell line-specific phenomenon, we tested several mammalian cell lines for an exemplified proteasomal subunit by immunoblotting. The human cell lines HeLa, HEK239, and T2 as well as green monkey COS7 cells were exposed to epoxomicin or MG132 and immunodetected for the catalytic β1/δ subunit, which had shown an up-regulation in its mRNA level (see above). Independent of the cell line used, Western blot analysis revealed a moderate increase in β1/δ proprotein as well as in matured β1/δ subunit (Fig. 1C). Although the increased expression of proteasome subunits in response to proteasome inhibition seems to be less pronounced in immortal cell lines than in a primary cell line, the results suggest that the observed up-regulation is a general phenomenon in mammalian cells that is irrespective of the cell type. To assure that the observed effects are indeed due to proteasome inhibition and not the result of apoptosis or cell death, the degrees of both proteasome inhibition and cell viability were analyzed after treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors. Inhibition of proteasome activity was measured in cellular extracts using a fluorogenic peptide substrate. As shown in Fig. 2A, c-lactacystin and MG132 inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity by 63 and 74% compared with controls, respectively. In contrast, the calpain inhibitor ALLM showed no effect (Fig. 2A). In addition, we analyzed the accumulation of p53, a specific substrate of the proteasome and that of multi-ubiquitinylated proteins. Increased levels of p53 and accumulation of multi-ubiquitinylated proteins was observed after c-lactacystin and MG132 treatment (Fig. 2B). Proteasome inhibitors also strongly induced the expression of Hsp70, which is a well known cellular response upon inhibition of the proteasome (29Bush K.T. Goldberg A.L. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9086-9092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Morimoto R.I. Santoro M.G. Nat.

Physiol. 2002; 282: R1016-R1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). ALLM, on the other hand, failed to demonstrate these effects. Furthermore, cell viability tests showed that the cells were perfectly viable under the inhibitor conditions used (Fig. 2C). Up-regulation of Proteasome Subunits Occurs in a Concerted Manner—To analyze whether up-regulation of proteasome subunits occurs in a concerted fashion and also holds true for other proteasome subunits, we performed an extensive expression analysis for most of the known subunits of the 26 S proteasome. Proteasome mRNA levels were quantified by real time RT-PCR analysis and normalized to the mRNA level of hypoxanthine phosphoryribosyl transferase. Alterations in mRNA expression are expressed as the relative mRNA levels of treated versus control cells. As summarized in Table I, treatment with c-lactacystin or MG132 resulted in a concerted up-regulation of the mRNA level of all constitutive 20 S and ATPase subunits by a factor of 1.5–4. In most cases, both inhibitors increased mRNA levels of individual subunits to a similar extent, e.g. the mRNA of the α5 subunit (PSMA5) was up-regulated by a factor of 4 or 3.9 by c-lactacystin or MG132, respectively, whereas β5/MB1(PSMB5) mRNA was up-regulated by the two inhibitors by a factor of only 1.5. In a few cases, however, i.e. α4 and α1 subunits (PSMA7 and PSMA6) and the ATPase subunits Rpt2 (PSMC1) and Rpt6 (PSMC5), c-lactacystin and MG132 induced up-regulation of proteasome subunit mRNAs to different extents. The change in mRNA levels of the non-ATPase subunits of the 19 S complex appeared to be only moderate and less uniform. For example, whereas Rpn3 (PSMD3) was induced nearly by a factor of 3.5 by both inhibitors, induction of other lid subunits was less pronounced. Interestingly, mRNA levels of the two immunosubunits LMP2 (PSMB9) and LMP7(PSMB8) were not at all or only slightly increased, and PA28 α and β subunits were not up-regulated at all (data not shown). In summary, the data shown in Table I demonstrate that treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors results in an upregulation of proteasome subunit mRNAs and that this up-regulation occurs in a concerted manner.Table IReal time RT-PCR expression analysis of proteasomal subunitsGene/subunitRelative RNA expressionRatio c-lactacystin/Me2SORatio MG132/Me2SOPSMA1/α6/C23.83.4PSMA2/α2/C31.81.8PSMA3/α7/C82.42.5PSMA4/α3/C92.41.8PSMA5/α5/zeta4.03.9PSMA6/α1/iota2.11.3PSMA7/α4/XAPC73.62.5PSMB1/β6/C51.81.9PSMB2/β4/C7-12.82.4PSMB3/β3/C103.13.4PSMB4/β7/N32.32.9PSMB5/β5/Mb11.51.5PSMB6/β1/δ2.52.6PSMB7/β2/Z2.32.6PSMB8/LMP7/β5i0.50.5PSMB9/LMP2/βli1.21.2PSMC1/Rpt2/S42.11.3PSMC2/Rpt1/S72.11.9PSMC3/Rpt5/S6a2.22.1PSMC4/Rpt3/S6b2.92.7PSMC5/Rpt6/S83.32.2PSMC6/Rpt4/S10b2.12.3PSMD1/Rpn2/S12.41.6PSMD3/Rpn3/S33.63.7PSMD4/Rpn10/S5a1.31.6PSMD8/Rpn12/S142.31.7PSMD9/Rpn12/S151.61.0PSMD10/Rpn12/p280.40.3PSMD11/Rpn6/S931.3PSMD13/Rnp13/S111.51.5 Open table in a new tab The Cellular Response to Proteasome Inhibitors Is Time- and Concentration-dependent—The data obtained thus far suggest the onset of an autoregulatory feedback mechanism in response to inhibition of proteasome activity. If so, then the increased expression of the proteasome ought to be dependent on time and on the concentration of proteasome inhibitor. We therefore treated VSMCs with different concentrations of MG132 (0.05–1 μm) for 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. RNA expression of three representative proteasome subunits, α6 (PSMA1), β1 (PSMB6), RPT2 (PSMC1), and Hsp70 was quantified by real time PCR analysis. Up-regulation of the mRNA expression of all three proteasome subunits by MG132 occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Proteasome mRNA expression started to increase with concentrations as low as 50 nm and reached its maximal (nearly 2-fold) increase with 0.5 and 1 μm MG132. mRNA up-regulation started 4 h after treatment with MG132, peaked at 12 h, and started to decline after 24 h. This elevation of mRNA levels was nearly abolished after 48 h (data not shown). To control the proteasome inhibitory effects of MG132, we monitored Hsp70 mRNA expression (Fig. 3A). Expression of Hsp70 mRNAs also increased in a time- and concentration-dependent manner starting with 0.1 μm MG132 after 4 h and peaked with 0.5 and 1 μm after 6 h, reaching induction levels between 200- and 400-fold. Even low concentrations of MG132 (50 nm) induced an Hsp70 response in the cells although to a lesser extent and at a later time point (70-fold after 12 h). The above results were corroborated by analysis of proteasomal activity in VSMC lysates (Fig. 3B). Inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 also occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, i.e. 50 nm MG132 inhibited the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome after 6 h by up to 25% compared with controls. Maximal inhibition was achieved with 0.5 and 1 μm MG132 after 12 h. Thus, the time- and concentration-dependent response closely mirrored the pattern of expressional up-regulation of the proteasomal subunits. Up-regulation of Proteasome mRNAs Is Dependent on"

Therefore, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify the pattern of dexamethasone-induced changes in gene expression in two well characterized models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, the murine lymphoma cell lines S49.A2 and WEHI7.2. Dexamethasone treatment induced a diverse set of gene changes that evolved over a 24-h period preceding the onset of cell death. These include previously reported changes in the expression of genes regulating prosurvival signals mediated by c-Myc and NFκB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that glucocorticoid treatment increases expression of the gene encoding Bim, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that is capable of directly activating the apoptotic cascade. Induction of Bim was confirmed by immunoblotting not only in S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells but also in the human leukemia cell line CEM-C7 and in primary murine thymocytes. All three prototypical isoforms of Bim (BimEL, BimL, and BimS) were induced by dexamethasone. Because elevated expression of Bim initiates the execution phase of cell death, this report that Bim is induced by dexamethasone provides novel insight into the mechanism through which glucocorticoid-mediated changes in gene expression induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells.

Because elevated expression of Bim initiates the execution phase of cell death, this report that Bim is induced by dexamethasone provides novel insight into the mechanism through which glucocorticoid-mediated changes in gene expression induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells. The ability of glucocorticoid hormones to induce apoptosis in leukemia and lymphoma cells has been utilized by physicians for nearly a half-century (1Vietti T.J. Sullivan M.P. Berry B.H. Hardy T. Haggard M. Blattner R. J. Pediatr. 1965; 66: 18-65Google Scholar, 2Wolff J.A. Brubaker C.A. Murphy M.L. Pierce M.L. Severo N. J. Pediatr. 1967; 70: 626-631Google Scholar). Today glucocorticoids are common components in many chemotherapeutic protocols for lymphoid malignancies, including multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (3Alexanian R. Dimopoulosu M.A. Delasalle K. Barlogie B. Blood. 1992; 80: 887-890Google Scholar, 4Forbes I.J. Zalewski P.D. Giannakis C. Cowled P.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 198: 367-372Google Scholar, 5Gaynon P.S.

In fact, glucocorticoid therapy is essential for the successful treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5Gaynon P.S. Carrel A.L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 593-605Google Scholar). Apoptosis is an orderly process of cell death typified by protease and endonuclease activation and is characterized morphologically by condensed chromatin, a reduction of cell volume, and plasma membrane blebs (7Kerr J.F. Wyllie A.H. Currie A.R. Br. J. Cancer. 1972; 26: 239-257Google Scholar). Whether or not a cell will initiate the apoptotic cascade depends upon the relative expression of the pro- and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family (8Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins all are related by the conservation of at least one Bcl-2 homology (BH) 1The abbreviations used are: BH, Bcl-2 homology; PUMA, p53-upregulated modulator of apoptosis. domain (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Google Scholar). Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL contain four BH domains and are capable of inhibiting apoptosis. Family members, such as Bax and Bak, share multiple BH domains with the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins; however, these proteins are proapoptotic and are required for nearly all forms of apoptosis (10Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar). A host of proapoptotic proteins containing only the BH3 domain also exists within the Bcl-2 family. These include Bim, Bbc3/PUMA, Bad, and Bid (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Google Scholar, 11Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins are required for the initiation of apoptosis by multiple stimuli and have been identified in species as primitive as Caenorhabditis elegans (12Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Google Scholar). They initiate apoptosis either by inhibiting antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (12Huang D.C. Strasser A. Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Google Scholar, 13O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Google Scholar) or by activating proapoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bak (14Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3577-3589Google Scholar). Many death-inducing signals activate constitutively expressed apoptotic machinery capable of triggering apoptosis without altering gene expression. Unlike these signals, glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis requires the activation of an incompletely defined program of transcriptional regulation initiated by the glucocorticoid receptor (15Distelhorst C.W. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 6-19Google Scholar). The glucocorticoid receptor belongs to the nuclear steroid hormone receptor family of zinc finger transcription factors. Upon ligand binding, the receptor dissociates from its cytosolic chaperone complex, homodimerizes, and translocates into the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, the glucocorticoid receptor can stimulate or repress gene expression either directly by binding glucocorticoid response elements on regulatory regions of target genes or indirectly through protein-protein interactions with other transcription factors, including NFκB and AP-1 (16Deroo B.J. Archer T.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3039-3046Google Scholar, 17Herrlich P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2465-2475Google Scholar, 18Tao Y. Williams-Skipp C. Scheinman R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2329-2332Google Scholar). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcriptional regulation is required for apoptosis. Glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis can be blocked by cycloheximide and actinomycin D, demonstrating a dependence on de novo protein and RNA synthesis (19McConkey D.J. Nicotera P. Hartzell P. Bellomo G. Wyllie A.H. Orrenius S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 269: 365-370Google Scholar, 20Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42Google Scholar, 21Wyllie A.H. Morris R.G. Smith A.L. Dunlop D. J. Pathol. 1984; 142: 67-77Google Scholar). Resistance to glucocorticoid therapy in vivo often involves the loss of a functional glucocorticoid receptor, and glucocorticoid receptor mutants lacking the domains required for either transactivation or transrepression are unable to induce apoptosis (22Geley S. Hartmann B.L. Hala M. Strasser-Wozak E.M. Kapelari K. Kofler R. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5033-5038Google Scholar, 23Catts V.S. Farnsworth M.L. Haber M. Norris M.D. Lutze-Mann L.H. Lock R.B.

Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 967-978Google Scholar). Furthermore, Reichardt et al. (26Reichardt H.M. Tuckermann J.P. Gottlicher M. Vujic M. Weih F. Angel P. Herrlich P. Schutz G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7168-7173Google Scholar) have demonstrated that binding of the glucocorticoid receptor to DNA is required for glucocorticoid induced-apoptosis in thymocytes. This involves the use of a knock-in mouse model expressing a glucocorticoid receptor (A458T) that is unable to dimerize and cooperatively bind palindromic glucocorticoid response elements. Because glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis is mediated by the regulation of gene expression, much attention has been centered on the ability of glucocorticoids to repress the activity of prosurvival transcription factors such as c-Myc, NFκB, and AP-1 (27Medh R.D. Wang A. Zhou F. Thompson E.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4629-4639Google Scholar, 28Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Google Scholar, 29He H.

These studies have elucidated transcriptional targets of the glucocorticoid receptor that regulate signal transduction pathways capable of altering the balance between life and death. Although these data clearly demonstrate that repressing prosurvival signals shifts the balance in favor of death, studies to date have not identified transcriptional targets capable of directly initiating the apoptotic cascade. To understand better the transcriptional regulatory changes that promote apoptosis, we have used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify a set of glucocorticoid-regulated genes common to two glucocorticoid-sensitive models of T-cell lymphoma, the S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 murine cell lines. Using this paradigm, we have discovered that bim, a proapoptotic BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family, is induced following dexamethasone treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first report that a proapoptotic protein capable of directly initiating the apoptotic cascade is induced following dexamethasone treatment. Cell Culture—WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 murine T-cell lymphoma lines were gifts of Drs. Diane Dowd and Roger Miesfeld, respectively. The CEM-C7 human acute T-cell leukemia line was a gift of Dr. Brad Thompson. WEHI7.2 and S49.A2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone), 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin. CEM-C7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin. Unless otherwise noted, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. All experimental cultures were started at a density of 1–2 × 105 cells/ml and grown in a humidified 7% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. For kinetic analysis, all samples were treated simultaneously and then harvested individually at the appropriate time after treatment. Expression Analysis—Gene expression analysis was performed essentially as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (31Inc Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual. Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA2002Google Scholar). Total RNA was harvested from both dexamethasone-treated (1 μm) and vehicle control populations at each time point by TRIzol (Invitrogen) extraction. TRIzol cell lysates were separated into aqueous and organic phases by the addition of chloroform to a final concentration of 20% (v/v). The aqueous phase was purified and concentrated using a Qiagen RNeasy minicolumn. DNA complementary to total RNA samples was reverse transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and a T7-(dT)24 primer (Operon). This cDNA was used as a template for the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA using the T7 Megascript kit from Ambion. Biotinylated cRNA probes were fragmented and hybridized to MG-U74A(v2) GeneChips (Affymetrix) using an Affymetrix GeneChip fluidics station 400 and standard Affymetrix protocols. Fluorescence intensities were captured with a GeneArray Scanner (Hewlett-Packard). GeneChip image files were processed using the Microarray Analysis suite, version 5.0 (Affymetrix). Probe cells displaying irregular fluorescence intensity over the area of the cell were excluded from subsequent analyses. To facilitate comparison between samples and experiments, the trimmed mean signal of each array was scaled to a target intensity of 1500. A comparative analysis between treatment and control samples for each time point was performed with the Affymetrix statistical algorithm using default parameters. To compensate for gene expression changes occurring in the control cultures over time, each treated sample was compared with a control sample that was split and harvested in parallel with the treated population. Metric files from expression and comparison analyses were exported to Microsoft Access XP for further filtering and analysis. In this work, genes termed “significantly changed” were those that possessed a reliably detectable signal (absolute call ≠ “absent” and signal ≥ 500 in treatment or control samples for inductions or repressions, respectively), determined by the statistical algorithm to be changed 2-fold or greater (change call ≠ “no change” and signal > 500 in treatment or control samples for inductions or repressions, respectively). To increase stringency, genes meeting the above criteria were filtered further to include only those that also were changed in the same direction (change call ≠ “no change”) in at least one adjacent time point regardless of magnitude. Hierarchical Clustering Analysis—Genes considered significantly changed (see “Expression Analysis” above) were grouped according to the similarity of their expression changes over time in both cell lines. An uncentered correlation similarity matrix and complete linkage analysis were selected to cluster signal log2 ratios using GeneCluster v.2.11 (Stanford University). Data were visualized using TreeView, version 1.5 (Stanford University). Immunoblot Analysis—Cell cultures were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate), to which complete protease inhibitor tablets were added according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Protein concentration in cell lysates was quantified by the Bradford method. The volume and the protein concentration in each of the samples were normalized by the addition of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer prior to loading. Lysates were mixed with an equal volume of 2× sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, and 0.2% bromphenol blue) and then boiled for 10 min. Proteins were resolved on 12.5% Tris-HCl SDS-PAGE with a 5% stacking gel and then immobilized by electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Nonspecific protein binding was blocked prior to incubation using primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk. The anti-Bim polyclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma; the anti-β-actin and anti-Bcl-2 antibodies were obtained from Pharmingen. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences) were used for antibody detection. Results are representative of at least three independent experiments. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by purification through an RNeasy minicolumn (Qiagen). Total RNA (10 μg) was separated in a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred to a Gene-Screen Plus membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10× SSC (0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m Na citrate) by capillary blotting. The RNA was fixed to the membrane by cross-linking with ultraviolet light (245 nm, 30 s, 1200 μJ) using a Strata-linker UV oven (Stratagene). Membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled bim probe prepared from full-length bimEL cDNA (a gift from Dr. Andreas Strasser) in QuikHyb (Stratagene) at 65 °C. Membranes subsequently were washed at 65 °C twice for 15 min each in 2× SSC, once for 30 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, and once for 10 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. Thymus Isolation—C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory) were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation between 6 and 12 weeks of age. Thymi were removed, rinsed in ice-cold growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 12.5 units/ml penicillin, and 12.5 μg/ml streptomycin), and then dispersed through a steel wire mesh into 5 ml of fresh, cold growth medium/thymus. The suspension of thymocytes was filtered through a nylon mesh to remove connective tissue. For each experiment, thymocytes were pooled from at least three mice, diluted to 2–3 × 106 cells/ml in warm growth medium, treated with dexamethasone or vehicle control, and grown in a humidified 7% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis was measured by quantification of cellular DNA content by flow cytometry. Culture samples containing 1.5 × 106 cells were collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 500 μl of ice-cold methanol, and then incubated for a minimum of 5 min at –20 °C. Methanol-fixed samples then were collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 2 min, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in propidium iodide staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 20 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1% sodium azide in phosphate-buffered saline. Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured using a FACScan XL flow cytometer (Coulter). Non-aggregated whole cells having a DNA content less than that of the G1 population were scored as apoptotic. Data analysis was performed using WinList 3D, version 4.0 (Verity Software House). Microarray Expression Analysis of Glucocorticoid-regulated Genes Identifies bim—Oligonucleotide microarray analysis was employed to identify glucocorticoid-regulated genes in the S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 murine T-cell lymphoma cell lines. Both cell lines are well studied models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, a phenomenon that is observed 24–36 h following treatment with 1 μm dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid (Fig. 1). The WEHI7.2 cell line is more sensitive to steroid-induced apoptosis, most likely because it expresses less of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein than the S49.A2 cells (Fig. 1B, inset). To determine glucocorticoid-regulated changes in gene expression that occur prior to the onset of apoptosis, RNA samples were extracted from cells treated with dexamethasone or ethanol vehicle 6, 12, 18, and 24 h after treatment. Expression profiles of both dexamethasone-treated and control populations at each time point were determined using Affymetrix MG-U74A(v2) GeneChips. A comparison of gene expression between treatment and control populations at each time point was performed using the Affymetrix Microarray Analysis suite, version 5.0. From over 10,000 genes or expressed sequenced tags represented on the array, 284 changed significantly after dexamethasone treatment in both cell lines (Table 1 in the supplemental material; see “Experimental Procedures” for selection criteria). Of the 284 genes within this set, 70% were induced, and 30% were repressed. Protein phosphatases, major histocompatibility complex antigens, and genes involved in free radical metabolism were the categories of dexamethasone-regulated genes for which the quantity frequently was altered (data not shown). Because both cell lines undergo apoptosis in response to dexamethasone, genes that are mediators of apoptosis are likely to be changed in the same direction in both cell lines. To identify this subset of genes, we subjected our data set containing 284 glucocorticoid-regulated genes to hierarchical clustering analysis (Fig. 2A). Clustering the data set in this manner allowed the identification of three groups of genes for which expression changed similarly in both cell lines. A predominant group of genes repressed in both cell lines contained familiar targets of glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression; these targets included phosphofructokinase, a class I major histocompatibility complex antigen, and c-myc (Fig. 2, Group I). Genes for which expression was induced by glucocorticoids in both cell lines were segregated into two distinct clusters according to the kinetics of their induction (Fig. 2B). Two inhibitors of prosurvival signals were induced with delayed kinetics; these were the NFκB inhibitor, IκB-α, and the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Fig. 2, Group II). Group III, by comparison, contained genes for which expression was induced rapidly, reaching a plateau between 12 and 18 h. On average, expression of genes within this group was increased by ∼2-fold as early as 6 h following dexamethasone treatment. This group contained a probe for the expressed sequence tag AA796690, a sequence that is homologous to the long splice variant of the Bcl-2 Interacting Mediator of Cell Death (bim) (Fig. 2, Group III). Because bim is capable of initiating apoptosis at the level of the mitochondrion, the induction of bim is the glucocorticoidmediated transcriptional event most directly related to apoptosis and therefore is the focus of this work. bim Is Induced by Dexamethasone—Based upon the hybridization signals for the AA796690 expressed sequence tag, the expression of bim was induced as early as 6 h following dexamethasone treatment and reached a maximum induction of greater than 2-fold after 24 h in both S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells (Figs. 2 and 3A). Northern blotting confirmed the elevated level of bim in WEHI7.2 cells (Fig. 3B). By immunoblot analysis, we observed the induction of all three prototypical isoforms, BimEL, BimL, and BimS, in both S49A2 and WEHI7.2 cells (Fig. 3, C and D, respectively). An increase in protein expression was apparent within 24 h of dexamethasone treatment in both cell lines. Bim not only was induced at the time dexamethasonetreated cells began to undergo apoptosis but also was induced only by doses of dexamethasone sufficient to induce apoptosis (Fig. 4).Fig. 4The dependence of Bim induction and apoptosis on dexamethasone concentration is similar.A, apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric quantification of DNA content in WEHI7.2 cells treated with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone for 36 h. Apoptosis is induced in WEHI7.2 cells with an EC50 of 35 ± 5.9 nm. Filled squares represent mean values ± S.E. of three experiments. The line represents a non-linear fit of the data to a variable slope sigmoidal dose-response equation. B, immunoblot of Bim induction in WEHI7.2 cells cultured with increasing concentrations of dexamethasone for 36 h. Dex, dexamethasone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Induction of bim Requires de Novo Transcription and Translation—Because de novo RNA and protein synthesis is required for dexamethasone-induced apoptosis in thymocytes, we tested whether the induction of bim expression similarly required de novo transcription and translation. WEHI7.2 cells were treated with dexamethasone in the presence and absence of the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In the presence of actinomycin D, the abundance of bim falls to barely detectable levels. Also, cycloheximide appears to block dexamethasone-induced bim expression (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that de novo transcription and translation are required for the induction of bim expression by dexamethasone. Furthermore, in the presence of actinomycin D, dexamethasone did not induce Bim protein expression after 36 h (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that the elevation of Bim is due to either an increase in bim transcription or the transcriptional induction of a protein that stabilizes the bim transcript. Bcl-2 Overexpression Does Not Prevent the Induction of Bim and Reveals the Induction of BimS—Bcl-2 overexpression inhibits glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the WEHI7.2 cell line (32Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 5407-5411Google Scholar). To verify that the induction of Bim is an event that precedes apoptosis, we tested whether Bcl-2 could prevent or delay its induction following dexamethasone treatment. WEHI7.2 cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2 were treated with dexamethasone and harvested for immunoblot analysis from 6 to 24 h following steroid treatment. As shown in Fig. 5C, Bcl-2 overexpression neither prevents nor alters the kinetics of Bim induction by dexamethasone. This demonstrates that the induction of Bim occurs prior to the onset apoptosis. These data are consistent with the evidence that Bim promotes apoptosis at a point in the apoptotic cascade that is inhibited by Bcl-2 (33Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protection offered by Bcl-2 overexpression enhanced the induction of BimS, the most potent Bim isoform, which is localized exclusively at the mitochondria and is capable of activating Bax (14Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3577-3589Google Scholar). Dexamethasone Induces Bim in Multiple Models of Glucocorticoid-induced Apoptosis—We next examined whether the induction of Bim by dexamethasone is limited to murine T-cell lymphoma lines or is a general characteristic of dexamethasone-induced apoptosis. Immunoblot analysis revealed that three isoforms, BimEL, BimL, and BimS, were induced in the human acute T-cell leukemia line CEM-C7 as early as 24 h after dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 6A). Thus the induction of Bim expression by dexamethasone may be relevant to therapy of human leukemia with glucocorticoids. Furthermore, we investigated whether the induction of Bim by dexamethasone is limited to transformed cells by examining its expression in primary murine thymocytes. Mouse thymocytes are acutely sensitive to dexamethasone and are a classic model system for studying the mechanism of corticosteroid-induced apoptosis (34Wyllie A.H. Beattie G.J. Hargreaves A.D. Histochem. J. 1981; 13: 681-692Google Scholar). Freshly isolated murine thymocytes were treated with dexamethasone in vitro. Dexamethasone induced apoptosis in this model system as early as 2 h following glucocorticoid treatment (Fig. 6B). Immunoblot analysis revealed that Bim, mainly the BimL isoform, was induced after 2 h of dexamethasone treatment (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, as little as 1 nm dexamethasone was sufficient to induce Bim within 8 h (Fig. 6D). The expression of Bim increased with steroid concentrations up to 100 nm. Higher doses of dexamethasone resulted in a reduction of Bim, an effect that is also apparent in the kinetic analysis (Fig. 6C) and likely the result of the swift induction of apoptosis and subsequent proteolysis in glucocorticoid-treated thymocytes. Using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays, we have identified a set of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in the S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 T-cell lymphoma lines. As expected in light of work published earlier (27Medh R.D. Wang A. Zhou F. Thompson E.B. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4629-4639Google Scholar, 28Heck S. Bender K. Kullmann M. Gottlicher M. Herrlich P. Cato A.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4698-4707Google Scholar, 29He H. Qi X.M. Grossmann J. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25015-25019Google Scholar, 30Ramdas J. Harmon J.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3813-3821Google Scholar), we identified several genes that are glucocorticoid-regulated and capable of tipping the balance between life and death toward death. For example, glucocorticoids suppress survival signals through either the direct repression of a survival gene, c-myc, or the induction of inhibitors of survival factors, including IκB-α and the regulatory subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. In addition, dexamethasone induces the expression of both the type I and type II inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors, consistent with evidence for a role of intracellular calcium release in apoptosis (20Cohen J.J. Duke R.C. J. Immunol. 1984; 132: 38-42Google Scholar, 35McColl K.S. He H. Zhong H. Whitacre C.M. Berger N.A. Distelhorst C.W. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1998; 139: 229-238Google Scholar, 36Jayaraman T. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3005-3012Google Scholar). However, because of its documented ability to initiate apoptosis, the discovery that Bim is induced by dexamethasone is the principal achievement of the microarray experiments described in this report. Dexamethasone induced the expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Bim not only in the S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 murine T-cell lymphoma cell lines but also in the human T-cell leukemia cell line CEM-C7 and primary thymocytes. Multiple laboratories have demonstrated that elevated expression of Bim, particularly the short isoform, is sufficient to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines (13O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Google Scholar, 33Cheng E.H. Wei M.C. Weiler S. Flavell R.A. Mak T.W. Lindsten T. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 705-711Google Scholar). Enforced expression of Bim leads to apoptosis in hematopoietic cells, even in the presence of cytokines, demonstrating that increased expression of Bim is sufficient to induce apoptosis in the absence of other apoptotic signals (37Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Google Scholar, 38Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M. Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5024-5031Google Scholar). Although the activity of BimEL and BimL can be regulated by interaction with the microtubuleassociated dynein motor complex, no such interaction occurs with BimS (39Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Google Scholar). In addition, the BH3 domain of Bim as well as full-length BimS bind Bax on the mitochondria, induce its oligomerization, and promote the release of cytochrome c (14Marani M. Tenev T. Hancock D. Downward J. Lemoine N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3577-3589Google Scholar, 40Letai A. Bassik M. Walensky L. Sorcinelli M. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Google Scholar). Thus the elevated expression of BimS following dexamethasone treatment is a death-promoting stimulus capable of directly initiating the apoptotic cascade. Strasser and colleagues (41Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Kontgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Google Scholar) have demonstrated that immature T-cells from bim–/– mice, although not completely resistant to glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, die with delayed kinetics following dexamethasone treatment. Because thymocytes from Bax–/–/Bak–/– mice are completely resistant to dexamethasone-induced apoptosis (10Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Google Scholar), the incomplete resistance of bim-deficient thymocytes to dexamethasone indicates that another BH3-only protein is compensating for the absence of bim. Among the known BH3-only proteins, Bim is the only one we observed as significantly induced during glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. It has been suggested that Bbc3/PUMA may promote glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in thymocytes because its transcript is induced following treatment with dexamethasone (42Han J. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Gu Z. Zambetti G.P. Lutz R.J. Zhu L. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11318-11323Google Scholar). However, we have not observed a glucocorticoidmediated increase in Bbc3/PUMA protein expression in either WEHI7.2 or primary mouse thymocytes (data not shown). Although the induction of bim by glucocorticoids has not been recognized previously, retrospective analysis of an earlier microarray report reveals evidence of bim induction by dexamethasone. Tonko et al. (43Tonko M. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Helmberg A. Kofler R. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 693-699Google Scholar) identified eight genes or expressed sequence tags coordinately regulated in both proliferating and G1/G0 arrested human CEM-C7 leukemia cells after glucocorticoid treatment. We find that one of the expressed sequence tags, AA682502, has high homology with the murine bim mRNA. Indeed, in the present report, immunoblot analysis confirmed that Bim is induced in CEM-C7 cells treated with dexamethasone. bim is likely a participant in glucocorticoid-mediated apoptosis; however, the mechanism of its regulation by glucocorticoids is not clear. Because the human bim promoter does not contain a glucocorticoid response element and cycloheximide blocks the induction of bim, this response may not be mediated directly by the glucocorticoid receptor. Recently, bim has been identified as a target of the forkhead family of transcription factors (44Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Google Scholar). Forkhead proteins like FKHRL1 are transcription factors in which activity is repressed when phosphorylated by prosurvival kinases such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and protein kinase B/Akt. Because we observed an induction of the regulatory phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase p85 subunit, the induction of bim may result from decreased survival kinase activity that leads to the activation of FKHRL1 (45Dijkers P.F. Birkenkamp K.U. Lam E.W. Thomas N.S. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 531-542Google Scholar, 46Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Google Scholar). Because glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis requires receptor-mediated regulation of gene transcription, the concept that glucocorticoid-induced cell death is mediated through the induction of a “death gene” emerged over 3 decades ago (47Baxter J.D. Harris A.W. Tomkins G.M. Cohn M. Science. 1971; 171: 189-191Google Scholar). Although the efforts of many laboratories have identified glucocorticoid-induced genes capable of reducing prosurvival signals, a glucocorticoid-induced death gene has remained elusive. Now we report the induction of the proapoptotic protein Bim by dexamethasone. Expression of Bim, particularly BimS, is capable of inhibiting the prosurvival activity of Bcl-2 and directly inducing the oligomerization of Bax. As bim-deficient thymocytes are not completely resistant to dexamethasone, further experiments are necessary to uncover which BH3-only protein works in concert with Bim to promote glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis. Only when all compensatory proteins are removed to generate a resistant phenotype can the role of individual BH3-only proteins be investigated. Nevertheless, the identification of bim as a glucocorticoid-induced death gene provides the foundation for developing a complete model of the glucocorticoid-induced apoptotic pathway. Understanding the mechanism by which glucocorticoids induce the expression of bim will reveal novel points along the death-promoting cascade at which apoptosis may be therapeutically accelerated.

Rat serum potently inhibited the precipitation of calcium phosphate mineral when the concentration of calcium and phosphate were increased by 10 mm each, and the modified serum was incubated at 37 °C for 9 days; in the absence of serum, precipitation occurred in seconds. Large amounts of the fetuin-mineral complex were generated in the first 3 h of this incubation and remained throughout the 9-day incubation. Purified bovine fetuin inhibited the precipitation of mineral for over 14 days in a solution containing 5 mm calcium and phosphate at pH 7.4 at 22 °C, whereas precipitation occurred in minutes without fetuin. There was a biphasic drop in ionic calcium in the fetuin solution, however, from 5 to 3 mm in the first hour and from 3 to 0.9 mm between 20 and 24 h; these changes in ionic calcium are due to the formation of complexes of calcium, phosphate, and fetuin. The complex found at 24 h to 14 days is identical to the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of etidronate-treated rats, whereas the complex found between 1 and 20 h is less stable.

The appearance of this complex in serum following etidronate injection causes a 4-fold increase in total serum calcium without any increase in ionic calcium levels.

Despite the abundance of fetuin in bone, however, it has not been possible to demonstrate the synthesis of fetuin in calcified tissues, and it is therefore presently thought that the fetuin found in bone arises from hepatic synthesis via serum (13Mizuno M. Farach-Carson M.C. Pinero G.J. Fujisawa R. Brunn J.C. Seyer J.M. Bousfield G.R. Mark M.P. Butler W.T. Bone Miner. 1991; 13: 1-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15Wendel M.

Matrix. 1993; 13: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Our working hypothesis is that the serum fetuin-mineral complex is formed spontaneously in bone metabolism under conditions in which fetuin inhibits the spontaneous precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase (16Price P.A. Caputo J.M. Williamson M.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Two experimental systems have been used to test this hypothesis. Previous studies have shown that fetuin is the major inhibitor of the precipitation of calcium phosphate mineral found in blood (2Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Poschke O. Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the first test accordingly examined the possible generation of the fetuin-mineral complex in serum to which sufficient calcium and phosphate had been added to exceed the spontaneous precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase in serum. Purified bovine fetuin has also been shown to inhibit the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase from solutions containing supersaturating amounts of calcium and phosphate (2Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Poschke O. Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and the second test therefore examined the possible generation of the fetuin-mineral complex in the course of this inhibition. The results of these experiments show that a fetuin-mineral complex apparently identical to that found in serum following etidronate administration is indeed generated during the course of the inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation in serum containing supersaturating amounts of calcium and phosphate and during the course of inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation from supersaturated solutions containing purified bovine fetuin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Simonsen albino male rats (Sprague-Dawley-derived) were purchased from Simonsen Labs (Gilroy, CA). Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration media was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. 45Ca was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Microcon YM-10 and Ultrafree CL filtration units were purchased from Millipore. Bovine fetuin (Sigma) was further purified before use by gel filtration over a 2 × 140-cm column of Sephacryl S300HR equilibrated with 5 mm ammonium bicarbonate.Formation of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex in Rat Serum—Blood was obtained from 42-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats. The blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature, and serum was collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge and was stored in 1-ml aliquots at –70 °C until use. To increase the concentrations of calcium and phosphate in serum, an aliquot of 0.5 m CaCl2 containing 700,000 cpm of 45Ca label was added rapidly to a 1-ml serum aliquot to achieve twice the desired final level of added calcium, and an aliquot of 0.5 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, was added rapidly to a second 1-ml serum aliquot to achieve twice the desired final level of added phosphate. The calcium-boosted serum aliquot was then drawn up in a disposable pipette and expelled rapidly into the phosphate-boosted aliquot. The serum samples were placed in 35-mm culture dishes (Falcon 3001) and incubated for 3 h or 9 days in a humidified incubator at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. The serum maintained a stable pH value of 7.4 throughout the duration of the incubation.Formation of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex during the Inhibition of Calcium Phosphate Mineral Formation by Pure Fetuin—The formation of calcium phosphate mineral was investigated at room temperature in solutions containing 0.2 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. In some experiments, 5 mg/ml of bovine fetuin was also added to this buffer. In a typical experiment, equal volumes of buffer were first prepared that contained either 10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, or 10 mm calcium containing 45Ca label. These solutions were then mixed rapidly to obtain a homogenous solution containing 5 mm in each ionic component. The samples of 100 μl were withdrawn at the appropriate time after mixing and centrifuged for 10 s in an Epifuge. The supernatants were immediately diluted 1:4 with HEPES buffer to arrest further mineral formation and stored at –70 °C until analysis.Biochemical Analyses—The calcium levels were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (Sigma), and the phosphate levels were determined colorimetrically as described (17Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5819) Google Scholar). Ionic calcium levels were measured at the indicated times using a calcium-specific electrode. The filtration experiments were carried out using 0.5-ml aliquots with a Microcon YM-10 filtration unit and using 2-ml aliquots with an Ultrafree CL filtration unit. The concentration of rat MGP was determined by radioimmunoassay, as described (18Otawara Y. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10828-10832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The amount of the high molecular mass fetuin-mineral complex in samples was determined by gel filtration using 25-ml columns of Sephacryl S300HR equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2 at room temperature as described previously (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and analyzed to determine the absorbance at 280 nm and the level of phosphate and 45Ca; the concentration of incorporated calcium was calculated from the specific activity of the 45Ca label. The amount of the high molecular mass fetuin-mineral complex was also investigated by analysis of the pellets formed after centrifugation of 0.25-ml aliquots for2hat 16,000 × g. After removal of the supernatants, each tube was rinsed briefly with 0.25 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. For chemical analysis, the pellets were dissolved in 125 μl of 50 mm HCl and analyzed for calcium, phosphate, and MGP. For electrophoresis, the pellets were dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and electrophoresed using 4–12% polyacrylamide gels (Novex, Inc., San Diego, CA). To see whether the presence of albumin in the pellet is due to nonspecific contamination of the pellet with serum, the initial pellet was resuspended in 125 μl of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.02% azide, and 0.15 m NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g; the resulting pellet was then analyzed as described above.RESULTSFormation of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex in Serum Following the Elevation of Calcium and Phosphate Levels—The first experiments were carried out to determine whether the fetuin-mineral complex is formed spontaneously when the calcium and phosphate levels in rat serum are increased above normal, and the modified serum is then incubated at 37 °C. The possible presence of the fetuin-mineral complex was initially assessed by gel filtration over Sephacryl S300HR, a method that has been shown previously to separate the high molecular mass fetuin-mineral complex from most other proteins in serum (1Price P.A.

Williamson M.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Calcium and phosphate were added to serum to increase the total levels of each by 10 mm, and the resulting modified serum was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, a time comparable with that required for the generation of the fetuin-mineral complex in vivo (1Price P.A.

As seen in Fig. 1, Sephacryl S300 analysis of this incubated serum sample revealed the presence of a large peak of calcium and phosphate in the high molecular mass position expected for the fetuin-mineral complex. Additional Sephacryl S300 experiments showed that no detectable high molecular mass peak of calcium and phosphate was formed after incubation for 3 h at 37 °C of serum alone or of serum with added 1, 2, or 5 mm calcium and phosphate (data not shown).The presence of the fetuin-mineral complex in serum was also assessed by centrifugation for 2 h at 16,000 × g, a procedure shown previously to sediment the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of etidronate-treated rats (1Price P.A.

Calcium and phosphate were again added to increase total serum levels of each by 10 mm, and the resulting modified serum was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Centrifugation of this modified serum produced a translucent, compact pellet that was visually identical to the translucent fetuin-mineral complex pellet formed by centrifuging serum from etidronate-treated rats (1Price P.A.

Chemical analysis of this pellet showed that it contained calcium, phosphate, and MGP (Fig. 2A), and SDS gel electrophoresis of this pellet revealed a protein composition essentially identical to that found in the fetuin-mineral complex pellet formed by centrifugation of serum from an etidronate-treated rat (1Price P.A.

N-terminal protein sequencing demonstrated that the 59-kDa band is rat fetuin and the 66-kDa band is rat albuminFig. 2Centrifugation evidence for the generation of the serum fetuin-mineral complex when rat serum is first increased by 10 mm in calcium and phosphate and then incubated at 37 °C. Sufficient calcium and phosphate were added to rat serum to increase total levels of each by 10 mm, and the resulting modified serum was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h or 9 days. Aliquots of 250 μl were centrifuged for 2 h at 16,000 × g, the supernatant was removed, and the pellets were washed once with the same volume of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. Some pellets were then resuspended in 125 μl of HEPES buffer and repelleted by centrifugation for an additional 30 min. A, pellets were dissolved in 100 μl of 150 mm HCl, and the solutions were analyzed to determine the level of calcium, phosphate, and MGP. B, pellets were dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA, electrophoresed on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Lanes 1, 4, and 6, Bio-Rad low molecular mass markers (MW Std); lane 2, initial pellet formed by centrifugation of serum that was modified by the addition of 10 mm calcium and phosphate and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C; lane 3, pellet fraction formed by centrifugation of control serum; lane 5, pellet obtained after resuspending the initial pellet in HEPES buffer and then centrifuging a second time; lane 7, initial pellet formed by centrifugation of serum that was modified by the addition of 10 mm calcium and phosphate and incubated for 9 days at 37 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because albumin is the major protein found in rat serum, with an abundance about 100-fold greater than fetuin, it is possible that the presence of albumin in the pellet fraction could reflect a small contamination of serum within the pellet rather than the specific association of albumin with the fetuin-mineral complex. To test this hypothesis, the initial pellet was resuspended in HEPES buffer and repelleted by centrifugation. This stratagem removed essentially all of the albumin contaminant with good recovery of fetuin (Fig. 2B, lane 5), which shows that the presence of albumin in the pellet is probably due to contamination of the pellet with serum rather than to the specific association of albumin with the fetuin-mineral complex.To further test the ability of serum fetuin to prevent the growth and precipitation of the mineral component of the complex, the levels of calcium and phosphate in rat serum were again increased by 10 mm each, and the resulting modified serum was incubated for 9 days at 37 °C. Centrifugation of this modified serum sample showed that a translucent pellet was formed that contained calcium and phosphate in amounts somewhat greater than the amounts seen after 3 h of incubation and MGP levels that were significantly lower (Fig. 2A). SDS gel electrophoresis of this pellet revealed a protein composition that is essentially identical to that found for the pellet formed after 3 h of incubation of the modified serum sample (Fig. 2B, lane 7), with a major band at the 59-kDa position of fetuin and a minor band at the 66-kDa position of albumin. These results show that the fetuin-mineral complex formed by incubation of modified serum in vitro is exceptionally stable and further support the hypothesis that one function of the fetuin component of this complex is to arrest growth of the mineral component.Formation of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex during the Inhibition of Calcium Phosphate Mineral Formation by Pure Fetuin at5mm Calcium and Phosphate—Previous studies have shown that bovine fetuin is a potent inhibitor of calcium phosphate mineral precipitation (2Schinke T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and experiments were accordingly carried out to determine whether the fetuin-mineral complex might be formed in the course of this inhibition. The first experiment monitored the detailed time course of the precipitation of calcium phosphate mineral in the presence and absence of bovine fetuin using 5 mm calcium and phosphate at pH 7.4, which are conditions that are essentially identical to those used in previous inhibition studies with bone Gla protein (19Price P.A.

Muller-Esterl W. Jahnen-Dechent W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3, in the absence of fetuin the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase is rapid and biphasic, with an initial drop in solution calcium to ∼3 mm within 1 min, a plateau until 30 min, and a subsequent rapid decline to about 0.5 mm by 1 h. The biphasic nature of calcium phosphate precipitation was not noted in earlier studies because the first time points measured were1hor later (2Schinke T. Amendt C. Trindl A. Poschke O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20789-20796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), fetuin completely prevented the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase (Fig. 3), and the solution remained clear over the 3-h period of observation.Fig. 3The precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral in solutions containing 5 mm calcium and phosphate is biphasic, and is inhibited by fetuin. The formation of calcium phosphate mineral was investigated at room temperature in solutions containing 0.2 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.4. 1-ml aliquots of buffer were first prepared that contained 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) or 10 mm calcium. These solutions were then mixed rapidly to obtain a homogenous solution containing 5 mm in each ionic component. Samples of 100 μl were withdrawn at the indicated times and centrifuged for 10 s in an Epifuge. The supernatants were immediately diluted 1:4 with HEPES buffer to arrest further mineral formation. The effect of fetuin was investigated by addition of 5 mg/ml bovine fetuin to the buffer prior to the addition of calcium or phosphate. The data show the concentration of calcium measured in the supernatant (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To see whether the ability of fetuin to prevent the formation of a calcium phosphate precipitate is due to the formation of complexes between fetuin and nascent crystal nuclei, the level of ionic calcium was measured with an ion-specific electrode over the period in which fetuin inhibits the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase. As can be seen in Fig. 4, ionic calcium levels fell to about 3 mm within 1 h and then remained at this value for 20 h. There was then a transition to 0.9 mm calcium at 24 h and a slower decrease to less than 0.5 mm calcium at 48 h. The biphasic nature of these changes closely parallels the biphasic precipitation of calcium in the absence of fetuin shown in Fig. 3, and the concentration of calcium in the first and second plateau regions is similar. The solution of fetuin and 5 mm calcium and phosphate remained completely clear over the initial 16-h period of observation. It then became distinctly opalescent by 24 h and remained comparably opalescent over a 14-day period of observation, with no evidence for the precipitation of a calcium phosphate mineral phase.Fig. 4There is a biphasic change in ionic calcium levels in solutions containing 5 mm calcium and phosphate when the precipitation of mineral is inhibited by fetuin. The changes in ionic calcium levels were investigated at room temperature in solutions containing 0.2 m HEPES buffer at pH 7.4 and 5 mg/ml bovine fetuin. 2.5-ml aliquots of buffer were first prepared that contained 10 mm phosphate (pH 7.4) or 10 mm calcium. These solutions were then mixed rapidly to obtain a homogenous solution containing 5 mm in each ionic component. The control solution contained the same 0.2 m HEPES buffer, 5 mg/ml fetuin, and 5 mm calcium but did not contain phosphate. Ionic calcium levels were measured at the indicated times using a calcium-specific electrode (see “Experimental Procedures”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)This experiment was repeated using a filtration procedure to separate free calcium from calcium associated with higher molecular mass complexes. As seen in Fig. 5, filtration of the solution of fetuin and 5 mm calcium and phosphate through a membrane with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off revealed a biphasic decrease in filtrate calcium essentially identical to that seen for ionic calcium, with a decrease to 3 mm calcium within 1 h, a plateau until 16 h, and then a decline to below 1 mm by 24 h. The solution was clear until 16 h and again became distinctly opalescent by 24 h.Fig. 5There is a biphasic change in filtrate calcium levels in solutions containing 5 mm calcium and phosphate when the precipitation of mineral is inhibited by fetuin.

https://openalex.org/W2016909880,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a proinflammatory cytokine with important roles in regulating inflammatory responses as well as cell cycle proliferation and apoptosis. Although TNFalpha stimulates apoptosis, it also activates the transcription factor NF-kappa B, and studies have shown that inhibition of NF-kappa B potentiates the cytotoxicity of TNFalpha. Since several chemotherapy agents act like TNFalpha to both promote apoptosis and activate NF-kappa B, understanding the role of NF-kappa B in suppressing apoptosis may have significant clinical applications. To understand the effects of stimulation with TNFalpha and the role of NF-kappa B in regulating this response, a 23k human cDNA microarray was used to screen TNFalpha-inducible genes in HeLa cells. Real-time PCR verified expression changes in 16 of these genes and revealed three distinct temporal patterns of expression after TNFalpha stimulation. Using RNA interference to disrupt expression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappa B, all but two of the genes were shown to depend on this transcription factor for their expression, which correlated well with the existence of NF-kappa B binding sites in most of their promoters. Inflammatory, proapoptotic, and antiapoptotic genes were all shown to be regulated by NF-kappa B, demonstrating the wide variety of targets activated by NF-kappa B signaling and the necessity of differentiating among these genes for therapeutic purposes."

By rapidly migrating from one cell pole to the other, MinD helps to block unwanted septation events at the poles. MinD is an amphitropic protein that is localized to the membrane in its ATP-bound form. A C-terminal domain essential for membrane localization is predicted to be an amphipathic α-helix with hydrophobic residues interacting with lipid acyl chains and cationic residues on the opposite face of the helix interacting with the head groups of anionic phospholipids (Szeto, T. H., Rowland, S. L., Rothfield, L. I., and King, G. F. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 15693–15698). To investigate whether E. coli MinD displays a preference for anionic phospholipids, we first examined the localization dynamics of a green fluorescent protein-tagged derivative of MinD expressed in a mutant of E. coli that lacks phosphatidylethanolamine. In these cells, which contain only anionic phospholipids (phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin), green fluorescent protein-MinD assembled into dynamic focal clusters instead of the broad zones typical of cells with normal phospholipid content. In experiments with liposomes composed of only zwitterionic, only anionic, or a mixture of anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids, purified MinD bound to these liposomes in the presence of ATP with positive cooperativity with respect to the protein concentration and exhibited Hill coefficients of about 2. Oligomerization of MinD on the liposome surface also was detected by fluorescence resonance energy transfer between MinD molecules labeled with different fluorescent probes. The affinity of MinD-ATP for anionic liposomes as well as liposomes composed of both anionic and zwitterionic phospholipids increased 9- and 2-fold, respectively, relative to zwitterionic liposomes. The degree of acyl chain unsaturation contributed positively to binding strength. These results suggest that MinD has a preference for anionic phospholipids and that MinD oscillation behavior, and therefore cell division site selection, may be regulated by membrane phospholipid composition.

MinD protein, along with MinC and MinE, is required for selection of the correct placement of the division site in bacterial cells (1Rothfield L.I. Shih Y.-L. King G. Cell. 2001; 106: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). During vegetative growth, cell division in rodshaped bacteria occurs at the cell center. The earliest event in this process is the polymerization of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ at mid-cell into an annular structure called the Z-ring (2Rothfield L. Justice S. Garcia-Lara J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 423-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 3Margolin W. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 647-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 4Addinall S.G. Holland B. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 318: 219-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the absence of the min system, Z-rings form at mid-cell as well as cell poles, resulting in the production of minicells (5Åkerlund T. Bernander R. Nordstro̊m K. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2073-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The ATP-bound form of MinD, an amphitropic peripheral membrane protein, is localized to the membrane. The binding of MinE to MinD induces hydrolysis of ATP and the release of MinD into the cytoplasm (6Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The ATP binding cycle induced by MinE results in the rapid movement of MinD from one cell pole to the opposite cell pole, forming alternating broad polar zones (7Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4971-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). MinC is a specific inhibitor of Z-ring formation (8Hu Z. Mukherjee A. Pichoff S. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14819-14824Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 9Hu Z. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3965-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Because MinC binds to MinD, the movement of MinC from pole to pole with relatively long polar dwell times and a short transit time blocks the formation of polar Z-rings but not medial rings (10Meinhardt H. de Boer P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14202-14207Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 11Margolin W. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R395-R398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ATPase activity of MinD is presumed to provide the driving force for the pole-to-pole oscillation of the MinC division inhibitor. The mechanism of MinD binding to the membrane recently has been elucidated (12Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Hu Z. Saez C. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 196-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of MinD contains a highly conserved motif that is essential for membrane localization. This motif is unstructured in crystals of MinD (14Cordell S.C. Lowe J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 492: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 15Sakai N. Yao M. Itou H. Watanabe N. Yumoto F. Tanokura M. Tanaka I. Structure. 2001; 9: 817-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the motif is predicted to be an amphipathic α-helix with one side of the helix containing mainly hydrophobic amino acids and the other side containing mainly positively charged amino acids (12Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). According to the model (12Szeto T.H. Rowland S.L. Rothfield L.I. King G.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15693-15698Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), ATP binding to MinD induces a conformational change in the protein that results in a release of the C-terminal motif and exposure of its hydrophobic residues followed by binding to the phospholipid bilayer and helix formation. Such amphipathic helices usually align parallel to the membrane surface so that the hydrophobic residues interact directly with lipid acyl chains, whereas the cationic residues on the opposite face of the helix interact with the head groups of anionic phospholipids (for review, see Ref. 16Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1999; 16: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In the present study we use both in vivo and in vitro systems to examine directly whether the Escherichia coli MinD protein has a preference for anionic over zwitterionic phospholipids. Strains and Growth Conditions—To construct a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) 1The abbreviations used are: PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; CL, cardiolipin; PC, phosphatidylcholine; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; MIANS, 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid; LY, lucifer yellow iodoacetamide. -deficient strain expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) derivative of MinD, plasmid pWM1255 (17Corbin B.D. Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1988-2008Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was introduced into strain AD90 (pss93::kanR recA) carrying plasmid pDD72 (pssA+ camR), which has a thermosensitive origin of replication derived from plasmid pSC101 (18DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pWM1255 (ampR ColE1 origin) synthesizes MinE and a translational fusion of GFP to the N terminus of MinD, both from the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible Ptrc90 promoter (19Weiss D.S. Chen J.C. Ghigo J.M. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 508-520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain AD90/pDD72/pWM1255 (PE-containing) exhibits wild-type phospholipid composition. Curing of plasmid pDD72 as described previously (18DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in strain AD90/pWM1255, which lacks PE (contains only phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL)) but maintains the same membrane protein-to-phospholipid ratio as wild-type cells made up of solely PG and CL (18DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5323-5332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strains were grown on LB agar or liquid LB medium supplemented with 50 mm MgCl2 and 50 μg/ml ampicillin. To construct a MinD-overproducing strain, the E. coli minD gene was cloned as an EcoRI-HindIII fragment into plasmid pET28a+ (Novagen), fusing minD to an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and placing the His-minD construct under the control of the T7 promoter. This plasmid, pET28a-MinD (kanR), then was introduced into strain BL21(DE3) (20Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) to make strain WM1682. For His-MinD purification, WM1682 cells were grown overnight in LB medium with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C. The culture was diluted 100-fold in the same medium, and growth was continued to an A600 of 0.6. To induce overproduction of His-MinD, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to 1 mm, and cells were grown for an additional 2–3 h. The culture was collected by centrifugation and frozen at –80 °C. Purification of MinD—Cells from 1 liter of culture of WM1682 were suspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 25 μl of protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, set I). Cells were broken using a French press, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,500 × gav for 10 min (4 °C). The supernatant was centrifuged further at 120,000 × gav for 90 min (4 °C). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow slurry (Qiagen) was added to the supernatant (3 ml of slurry for 12 ml of supernatant) and mixed by shaking in a tube at 4 °C for 1 h. The slurry was poured into a column and washed twice with 8 ml of wash buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). His-MinD was eluted with three aliquots of elution buffer (2 ml) containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mm imidazole (pH 8.0). Fractions (2 ml) were collected into tubes containing 2 ml of 20% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method, and the fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing His-MinD were desalted on Sephadex G-25 columns equilibrated with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 150 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol (storage buffer) and were frozen in 0.2-ml aliquots at –80 °C. For some experiments, the His tag was removed from the protein by treatment with biotinylated thrombin (pET28a+ encodes a thrombin cleavage site) using the thrombin kit (Novagen) according to the kit instructions. Small scale optimization was done with serial dilutions of thrombin and monitoring of cleavage by using SDS-PAGE. After the cleavage reaction, biotinylated thrombin was removed with streptavidin-agarose as recommended in the kit instructions. Monitoring of GFP-MinD Movement in Cells—To observe MinD movement, cells were grown to exponential phase at 30 °C. Leaky expression from the Ptrc90 promoter of pWM1255 (without the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) resulted in levels of GFP-MinD high enough to be detected by the camera system but low enough to have minimal impact on cell physiology. For microscopic time-lapse studies, cells were immobilized as described by Corbin et al. (17Corbin B.D. Yu X.-C. Margolin W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1988-2008Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 μl of cell culture was mixed with an equal volume of molten growth medium containing 2% low melt agarose, was dropped onto a microscope slide, and was covered quickly with a cover glass. Fluorescence images were observed with a ×100 oil immersion objective on an Olympus BX60 microscope fitted with a GFP filter cube, and the images were captured with a light-sensitive Photometrics CoolSnap FX cooled charge-coupled device camera driven by QED image capturing software. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 s, each with 2–4-s exposures using 2 × 2 binning to improve sensitivity, and the images were saved as PICT files. Movies were made from these files with iMOVIE 2.2 software. Preparation of Liposomes—Soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC), CL from heart, synthetic dioleoyl-PG, E. coli PE, and E. coli polar phospholipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). E. coli PG and CL were purified from E. coli polar phospholipids (21Wang X. Bogdanov M. Dowhan W. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5673-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Liposomes were prepared by water bath sonication for 1–2 h (6–12 times for 10 min each) at 0 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 50 mm KCl and were stored at –80 °C. MinD Binding to Liposomes—The sedimentation assay (6Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) with minor modifications was used to study MinD binding to liposomes. MinD preparations first were centrifuged at 263,000 × gav for 10 min to remove potential MinD aggregates. MinD (0.2–20 μm) was mixed with 1 mm ATP or ADP and liposomes (160 μg/ml) in 100 μl of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 and was incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. After incubation, samples were centrifuged at 263,000 × gav at 30 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation, the pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer. Aliquots of 20 μl were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie Blue (Bio-Rad). The bands were quantified using FluorS-Max Multi-Imager with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The experimental data were compiled in KaleidaGraph 3.01. Lines on the graphs (Figs. 4 and 5) are curves calculated by the Hill equation that best fit the data points. Hill coefficients (nH) and association constants (Ka) were calculated from the graph in Fig. 5.Fig. 5Cooperative binding of MinD to liposomes of different phospholipid compositions. MinD at the indicated concentration was incubated with liposomes of different phospholipid compositions in the presence of 1 mm ATP. From top to bottom in the inset of the graph, the liposome compositions were as follows: PC (open squares), total E. coli phospholipids (filled squares), PC with 40 mol % PG (PC-PG; open circles), PC with 20 mol % E. coli CL (PC-CL(E.c.); cross-filled squares), PC with 20 mol % heart CL (PC-CL(heart); inverted filled triangles), dioleoyl-PG (DOPG; filled triangles), PG (filled circles), PG with 25 mol % E. coli CL (PG/CL (E.c.); open triangles), and dioleoyl-PG with 35 mol % E. coli CL (DOPG/CL(E.c.); filled diamonds). Samples were processed and analyzed as described for Fig. 4. Each point on the graph represents the amount of MinD bound to liposomes in the presence of ATP as a percentage of theoretical maximal binding calculated by using the Hill equation from graphs similar to the one presented in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Labeling of MinD with Fluorescent Probes—MinD (0.8 mg/ml) in 100 μl of the storage buffer was incubated at 22 °C in the dark with a 20-fold molar excess of 2-(4′-maleimidylanilino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (MIANS; Molecular Probes, M-8) or lucifer yellow iodoacetamide (LY; Molecular Probes, L-1338) for 2 h. The conjugate was separated on Sephadex G-25 columns equilibrated with the same buffer. The level of modification, estimated from protein concentration and fluorescence of standard dye solutions, was close to 1:1 for both dyes. Steady-state fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were conducted at 22 °C on a PTI QuantaMaster spectrofluorometer (Photon Technology International). Samples contained 1 μm total MinD protein in the same buffer that was used for the liposome sedimentation assay. Additional components were added as indicated. In a single scan, a sample was excited at 322 nm (slit width 4 nm), and emitted light was scanned from 350 to 600 nm (slit width 4 nm, scan rate 100 nm/min). GFP-MinD in PE-lacking Cells—We demonstrated previously that E. coli cells lacking PE were filamentous because of inhibition of cell division. The lack of PE did not prevent localization of FtsZ, FtsA, and ZipA in these cells, but the proteins often formed aberrant spiral structures (22Mileykovskaya E. Sun Q. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4252-4257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the dynamic localization of GFP-MinD in the pss93 mutant (AD90/pWM1255) containing the covering pDD72 plasmid, which maintains wild-type phospholipid composition and cell morphology. In these cells, GFP-MinD localized into a typical horseshoe structure on the membrane at the poles of the cells and oscillated from pole to pole in large zones with cycle times similar to those reported previously (data not shown) (7Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4971-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). In contrast, GFP-MinD movement in cells lacking PE was markedly different as shown by a typical time-lapse series of GFP-MinD movements in a filamentous PE-lacking cell (Fig. 1). Although the change in phospholipid composition still allowed movement of GFP-MinD in the PE-lacking cells, fluorescence localized as a “zigzag” pattern of compact spots along the filamentous cells. No clear back-and-forth movement was observed. As can be seen by following individual spots in Fig. 1, the lifetime of most spots was ∼30–50 s, about a factor of 2 longer than the shift-dwell-shift observed for GFP-MinD zones in PE-containing cells (7Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4971-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Because of the apparent random localization of the spots, it was difficult to establish their lineage during the time course. However, the simultaneous appearance of a new spot and disappearance of an old spot nearby in most cases suggested that material from the old spot was migrating to the new spot. For example, fluorescence in spots B and C, visible in the first panel, appears to have been transferred to spots E and D, respectively. If so, this would represent a distance of ∼0.5–1 μm, considerably less than the migration distances observed in filamentous cells with normal phospholipid composition (7Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4971-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the spots appeared to move not only along the long axis of the cell but also in the perpendicular direction (for example, see M–Q). This disturbed pattern of movement suggested that the high level of PG and CL and/or the lack of PE in the membrane results in the alteration of the GFP-MinD assembly-disassembly process on the membrane surface. This effect might be a consequence of the change in the affinity of MinD to the membrane composed of only anionic phospholipids. To test this proposal, we studied the interaction of MinD with liposomes of different phospholipid compositions in vitro. Interaction of Purified MinD with Liposomes—It was demonstrated that MinD with a His tag at the N terminus is functionally active in E. coli (23Lackner L.L. Raskin D.M. de Boer P.A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 735-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we constructed and purified a His-tagged MinD protein for in vitro experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). To study binding of MinD to liposomes, we used the method developed by Hu et al. (6Hu Z. Gogol E.P. Lutkenhaus J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6761-6766Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) in which the protein is incubated in the presence of ATP and liposomes followed by high speed centrifugation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Fig. 2, A and B, represents an experiment in which MinD was bound to liposomes of different phospholipid compositions. As seen in Fig. 2, A and B, MinD at 6 μm can bind to PC liposomes in an ATP-dependent manner. Enrichment of PC liposomes with an anionic phospholipid (CL from heart) strongly enhanced both specific (ATP-dependent) and nonspecific (ADP-dependent or without any nucleotide) binding of MinD. At the same time, enrichment of PC liposomes with PE did not change the level of MinD bound to liposomes. Binding to liposomes made from E. coli total phospholipid containing about 20% of anionic phospholipid was also higher than binding to PC or PC-PE liposomes. All these data together indicate that MinD has a higher affinity to liposomes that are enriched with anionic phospholipids. To investigate whether MinD binding to CL from heart is ATP-dependent, we decreased the concentration of MinD in the incubation mixture to 2.5 μm and determined the dependence of MinD binding on levels of CL by using PC-CL liposomes of varying CL concentrations (Fig. 3, A and B). The increase in the content of CL in PC liposomes enhanced ATP-dependent specific binding. However, nonspecific binding without nucleotides also was elevated in liposomes with higher CL concentrations. To exclude the possibility that the higher affinity to anionic phospholipids is a property of the His-tagged protein but not the native MinD, the tag was removed by thrombin digestion. MinD without the His tag had the same high affinity to PC-CL liposomes as His-tagged MinD (data not shown). All experiments described below were carried out with His-tagged MinD, and in all in vitro experiments described herein, His-MinD is referred as MinD. To study in more detail whether the affinity of MinD to the membrane depends on its phospholipid composition, we investigated the affinity of MinD to binding to liposomes of different phospholipid compositions as a function of MinD concentration. For each type of liposome, we measured the dependence of MinD binding on MinD concentration in the presence of ATP or ADP. Fig. 4 represents an example of such a titration experiment for PC liposomes enriched with E. coli PG. The amounts of MinD bound to liposomes are expressed in arbitrary units (A.U.). Every experimental point was obtained by quantification of the corresponding band after SDS-PAGE (see “Experimental Procedures”). Protein determination showed that in all experiments the amount of MinD bound to liposomes was no more than 15% of the total amount of MinD present (data not shown). Lines on the graphs represent the best fit to the experimental points as calculated by the Hill equation. The calculated association constant (Ka) and Hill coefficient (nH) for the ATP form of MinD were 4.5 μm and 2, respectively. Fig. 5 summarizes the results of nine titration experiments with liposomes of the indicated composition. Data points in Fig. 5 represent the amount of MinD bound to liposomes in the presence of ATP. To compare results of all experiments, data points for each experimental set were normalized by dividing by the theoretical maximal binding calculated from graphs similar to the one presented in Fig. 4. The values of the association constants and Hill coefficients are summarized in Table I. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table I, the affinity of MinD-ATP to liposomes is twice as high for the liposomes containing a fraction of anionic phospholipids and 9-fold higher for the entirely anionic liposomes than for the pure PC liposomes. The higher affinity of MinD to liposomes composed of PC and CL from heart compared with PC and CL from E. coli might be due to the difference in fatty acid composition of these two species of CL. CL from bovine heart is highly unsaturated and contains four polyunsaturated acyl chains, whereas acyl chains of CL from E. coli are both saturated and monounsaturated (24Koppelman C.M. den Blaauwen T. Duursma M.C. Heeren R.M. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6144-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with results (25Yung B.Y. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7202-7205Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) showing that the affinity of DnaA, another protein with amphipathic α-helices, to phospholipids depends on both the negative charge of head groups and the unsaturation of acyl chains.Table IAssociation constants (Ka) and Hill coefficients (nH) for saturable binding of MinD-ATP to liposomes of different phospholipid compositionsPhospholipid compositionKaaKa and nH have been calculated from Fig. 5.nHaKa and nH have been calculated from Fig. 5.PC9.12.1Total E. coli PLbPL, phospholipids.4.82.1PC with 20 mol % CL (E. coli)4.72.5PC with 40 mol % PG (E. coli)4.52.0PC with 20 mol % CL (heart)2.01.8PG1.91.5DOPGcDOPG, dioleoyl-PG.1.42.1PG with 25 mol % CL (E. coli)1.22.1DOPGcDOPG, dioleoyl-PG. with 35 mol % CL (E. coli)1.02.1a Ka and nH have been calculated from Fig. 5.b PL, phospholipids.c DOPG, dioleoyl-PG. Open table in a new tab As shown in Figs. 4 and 5 and Table I, the binding of MinD to liposomes in the presence of ATP displays a considerable positive cooperativity with respect to the protein concentration. The Hill coefficient of ∼2 is characteristic of MinD-ATP binding to all types of liposomes used in the experiments. This result suggests that MinD-ATP oligomerizes at least to the level of dimers on the liposome surface. In contrast, binding of MinD-ADP to liposomes (Fig. 4 and data not shown) was characterized by a Hill coefficient close to 1, which may reflect nonspecific binding without oligomerization on the surface of liposomes. Dimerization of MinD Probed by FRET—One very useful method for the analysis of protein-protein interactions is fluorescence resonance energy transfer. The specific utility of FRET rests in its ability to provide direct information on molecular proximity. In general, FRET measurements are made by observing the transfer of excited state energy from one chromophore (the donor) to another (the acceptor). In the most favorable instances, FRET can be used to determine accurately molecular distances over a range of 20–90 Å (26Lakowicz J.R. 2nd Ed. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 367-394Google Scholar, 27Van Der Meer B.W. Coker III, G. Chen S.-Y. Resonance Energy Transfer: Theory and Data.

To address the question of MinD dimerization, we chose MIANS and LY as a donor-acceptor pair because of the very good overlap of their emission and absorption spectra (322/417 and 426/531 nm excitation/emission maxima, respectively). MinD from E. coli contains two cysteines, Cys-52 and Cys-119; the former appears to be accessible for derivatization by these thiol-reactive dyes. Fig. 6 shows that the fluorescent spectrum of the equimolar mixture of MinD fluorescent derivatives in solution (thin continuous line) is identical to the sum of their individual spectra (wide gray line), indicative of the absence of any FRET between them. In contrast, incubation of this mixture with PC liposomes containing 20 mol % CL (heart) caused a decrease of the donor fluorescence and a proportional increase of the fluorescence from the acceptor, which is typical for FR"
https://openalex.org/W2049474922,"Using two agonistic monoclonal antibodies specific for each death receptor of TRAIL, 2E12 (anti-human DR4) and TRA-8 (anti-human DR5), we examined the signal transduction of the death receptors in combination with or without chemotherapy agents such as Adriamycin (doxorubicin hydrochloride) and Cisplatin. Our results demonstrated that chemotherapy agents were able to enhance apoptosis-inducing activity of these antibodies against several different types of tumor cell lines through enhanced caspase activation. The combination of the antibodies and chemotherapy agents led to a synergistical activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase, which was mediated by MKK4. The combination also caused an increased release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO from mitochondria in parallel with the profound loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest that the enhanced activation of the JNK/p38 kinase and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathways play a crucial role in synergistic induction of the death receptor-mediated apoptosis by chemotherapy agents. Thus, the simultaneous targeting of cell surface death receptors with agonistic antibodies and the intracellular JNK/p38 and the mitochondrial death pathways with chemotherapy agents would enhance the efficacy and selectivity of both agents in cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2073296716,"The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated in the carcinogenicity of this virus as a causative factor by means of its transactivation function in development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we and others have recently reported that HBx is located in mitochondria and causes subsequent cell death (Takada, S., Shirakata, Y., Kaneniwa, N., and Koike, K. (1999) Oncogene 18, 6965–6973; Rahmani, Z., Huh, K. W., Lasher, R., and Siddiqui, A. (2000) J. Virol. 74, 2840–2846). In this study, we, therefore, examined the mechanism of HBx-related cell death. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs of HBx, the region required for its mitochondrial localization was mapped to amino acids (aa) 68–117, which is essential for cell death but inactive for transactivation function. In vitro binding analysis supported the notion that the recombinant HBx associates with isolated mitochondria through the region of aa 68–117 without causing redistribution of cytochrome c and apoptosisinducing factor (AIF). A cytochemical analysis revealed that mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by HBx association with mitochondria, suggesting that HBx induces dysfunction of permeability transition pore (PTP) complex. Furthermore, PTP inhibitors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and Bcl-xL, which are known to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, prevented HBx-induced cell death. Collectively, the present results suggest that location of HBx in mitochondria of hepatitis B virus-infected cells causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induces mitochondria-dependent cell death. The hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) has been implicated in the carcinogenicity of this virus as a causative factor by means of its transactivation function in development of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, we and others have recently reported that HBx is located in mitochondria and causes subsequent cell death (Takada, S., Shirakata, Y., Kaneniwa, N., and Koike, K. (1999) Oncogene 18, 6965–6973; Rahmani, Z., Huh, K. W., Lasher, R., and Siddiqui, A. (2000) J. Virol. 74, 2840–2846). In this study, we, therefore, examined the mechanism of HBx-related cell death. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion constructs of HBx, the region required for its mitochondrial localization was mapped to amino acids (aa) 68–117, which is essential for cell death but inactive for transactivation function. In vitro binding analysis supported the notion that the recombinant HBx associates with isolated mitochondria through the region of aa 68–117 without causing redistribution of cytochrome c and apoptosisinducing factor (AIF). A cytochemical analysis revealed that mitochondrial membrane potential was decreased by HBx association with mitochondria, suggesting that HBx induces dysfunction of permeability transition pore (PTP) complex. Furthermore, PTP inhibitors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers and Bcl-xL, which are known to stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, prevented HBx-induced cell death. Collectively, the present results suggest that location of HBx in mitochondria of hepatitis B virus-infected cells causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently induces mitochondria-dependent cell death.

Imperial College Press, London1998: 75-92Google Scholar), and the X gene has been implicated in the carcinogenicity of this virus because of its ability to transform rodent cells (4Shirakata Y. Kawada M Fujiki Y. Sano H. Oda M. Yaginuma K. Kobayashi M. Koike K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Moreover, the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in at least one strain of transgenic mouse has been shown (5Kim C.M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jay G. Nature. 1991; 351: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Although there was an absence of tumors in other X transgenic mice so far analyzed, some of these mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to chemical carcinogens (6Slagle B.L. Lee T.H. Medina D. Finegold M.J. Butel J.S. Mol. Carcinog. 1996; 15: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 7Madden C.R. Finegold M.J. Slagle B.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3851-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These results suggest that HBV X protein (HBx) acts in cooperation with cellular oncogenic factors. However, pathogenesis and carcinogenesis by HBV infection are partly understood, because they occur over years of chronic infection and associate with hepatocyte death and regeneration. It has been reported that HBx is essential for the viral replication (8Zoulim F. Saputelli J. Seeger C. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bouchard M.J. Wang L.H. Schneider R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 2376-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), in addition to its well documented transactivation ability to indirectly stimulate transcription (10Twu J.S.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7721-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Although HBx transactivates a wide range of viral and cellular genes, including HBV itself, SV40, c-myc, and NF-κB, the mechanism of transactivation by HBx is still under debate (18Yen T.S. J. Biomed. Sci. 1996; 3: 20-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because HBx is unable to directly bind any of the HBx-responsive elements of these genes, it has been proposed that HBx may stimulate transcription by interacting with several cellular sequence-specific transcription factors or with the basal transcriptional machinery (19Maguire H.F. Hoeffler J.P. Siddiqui A. Science. 1991; 252: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 20Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9982-9988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). From these observations, it has been suggested that HBx may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis through transactivating cellular oncogenes and signaling cascades that stimulate cell proliferation. In contrast to proliferative effects, several studies (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 22Su F. Schneider R.J.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2860-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that HBx induces cell death or sensitizes cells to apoptotic stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor α. Our previous report revealed that expression of X gene brought some of apoptotic features to cells, such as TUNEL-positive nucleus, the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and the membrane blebbing. We also reported that the ectopically expressed HBx is located in mitochondria (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Recently, many reports have focused on mitochondria as an important player on apoptosis and programmed cell death, where many cell death signals reach to mitochondria. Mitochondria undergo major changes in membrane integrity before classical signs of cell death manifest. These changes concern both inner and outer mitochondrial membranes. Outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization causes the redistribution of numerous apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c, AIF, and Smac/DIABLO in the intermembrane space (24Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). The redistribution of these apoptogenic factors is important step of cell death. For instance, cytochrome c release is essential for the generation of the apoptosome, the complex containing cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and caspase-9, and this apoptosome complex initiates the effector caspase activation (26Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar, 27Zou H. Li Y. Liu X. Wang X. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11549-11556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 28Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization causes disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm). The ΔΨm is indispensable for driving the ATP synthase, which phosphorylates ADP to ATP. Therefore the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential means the loss of ATP generation. In this paper, we show that the localization of HBx on mitochondria causes loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequently causes cell death through a mitochondria-dependent pathway. Reagents and Plasmids—The X expression plasmid pCMVX, pCMVX-dAvaI/AvaII, and pCMVX-ΔRsaI were described previously (12Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-xL cDNA was cloned into pCMV vector. EGFP or EBFP fusion constructs were cloned into pEGFP or pEBFP vector (Clontech), respectively. Substitution of pEGFP-X(68–117LA) in HBx pEGFP-X(68–117) was carried out by PCR based site-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMVβ, was obtained from Clontech. Caspase inhibitors, z-VAD-fmk and z-DEVD-fmk were obtained from Enzyme Systems Products. Bongkrekic acid was obtained from Calbiochem, and cyclosporin A, 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzenedisulfonic acid (Tiron), and N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—HuH7 cells and HepG2 cells were maintained in DM-160AU supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 60 μg/ml kanamycin. Transfections were carried out using Tfx-20 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were cultured for 2 days after transfection and subjected to cytochemical staining or Western blot analysis unless stated. Cell Death Assay—HuH7 cells were transfected with indicated plasmid along with the β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMVβ, at a ratio of 5:1. The amount of cell death was determined by counting the β-galactosidase-stained transfected cells with apoptotic morphology, such as membrane blebbing and/or round. Over 50 of β-galactosidasestained cells were counted and calculated relative percent of cell death. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and obtained similar results. In situ staining of cells for β-galactosidase activity were performed with β-galactosidase staining kit (Invitrogen). Luciferase Assay—HepG2 cells were plated on the day before transfection at a density of 6.8 × 105 cells per 60-mm-diameter dishes. 1 μg of pRSVL and 0.1 μg of pCMVX or HBx mutant constructs were cotransfected using Tfx-20 reagent. pCMV was used as carrier to adjust the total DNA to 2.75 μg. Two days after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assay was carried out with extracts according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western Blot Analysis—Immunoblots were performed as described previously (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cytochrome c antibody (PharMingen), anti-AIF antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) has been used at dilution of 1:500. Reactive protein bands were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham) system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microscopic Analysis—Mitochondria were visualized with MitoTracker (Red CMXRos) and 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1). MitoTracker and JC-1 are obtained from Molecular Probes. Cells were incubated with MitoTracker (500 nm) or JC-1 (10 μg/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C, and then a specimen was analyzed using a Nikon microscope with CCD camera, which was operated by ARGUS FISH Imaging Software (Hamamatsu Photonics). Mitochondria Preparation and Co-precipitation Assay—Before preparation a mouse (BALB/c, female, 6–8 weeks) was starved for 16 h. Isolation of mitochondria is followed by Shimizu et al. (29Shimizu S. Eguchi Y. Kamiike W. Funahashi Y. Mignon A. Lacronique V. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1455-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 30Narita M. Shimizu S. Ito T. Chittenden T. Lutz R.J. Matsuda H. Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14681-14686Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) with slight modification. Briefly, the liver was flushed with phosphate-buffered saline and homogenized with a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer in 15 ml of mitochondria isolation buffer (0.35 m mannitol, 10 mm Hepes, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelletted by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were further centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondria pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of mitochondria isolation buffer. A 30-μl aliquot of mouse liver mitochondria was incubated with the indicated recombinant protein in 30 μl of the same buffer for 60 min at 30 °C. At the end of incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the pelleted mitochondria fraction was resuspended in 50 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer, and 12 μl of 6 × SDS sample buffer was added to the resulting supernatant. The samples were boiled and subjected to Western blot analysis. Recombinant proteins were purified as follows. His-tagged fusion proteins were produced in Eschericha coli, BL21(DE3)pLysS, and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen) followed by high performance liquid chromatography purification. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar). Membrane Blebbing Morphology of the HBx-expressing Cells—Our previous report (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) indicated that X gene expression brought about some apoptotic changes to cells such as TUNEL-positive nucleus, the decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and the membrane blebbing. To characterize details of morphological changes, the membrane blebbing was examined using the HBx-expressing cells and the staining technique, because this protocol is easy to distinguish cells which are transfected with DNA and is able to handle many cells for estimating the frequency of dying cells. We carried out the time course analysis of HBx-induced cell death. HuH7 cells were transfected with an X gene expression plasmid, pCMVX, along with β-galactosidase expression plasmid, pCMVβ. The β-galactosidase staining was performed to visualize cells transfected with plasmids DNA. As shown in Fig. 1A, the HBx-expressing cells showed round and blebbing morphology that are easily distinguished from that of vector-transfected control cells. This type of morphological change is known to be characteristic of apoptosis (32Bright J. Khar A. Biosci. Rep. 1994; 14: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 1B, the level of β-galactosidase activity-positive cells with membrane blebbing reached a maximum in 3 days after transfection. The following experiments for cell death analysis were therefore carried out at 3 days after transfection. Transactivation Function of HBx Is Not Required for Cell Death—As we previously reported, some regions of HBx, such as aa 61–69, 105–125, and 131–140 (Fig. 2A, indicated as black box) are responsible for transactivation function (12Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar), and that mutants lacking one of these regions lose their transactivation ability, we, therefore, examined whether the transactivation function of HBx is required for HBx-induced cell death. The luciferase assay and the morphological characterization were carried out using two different transactivation-defective mutants, one is a deletion mutant, pCMVX-dAvaI/AvaII, which has an internal deletion from aa 5 to 62, and the other mutant is pCMVX-ΔRsaI that has C terminus truncation from aa 134 to 154. Consistent with previous report (12Arii M. Takada S. Koike K. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 397-403PubMed Google Scholar), these mutants were unable to activate the RSV promoter (Fig. 2C), whereas these two mutants still retain cell death activity comparable with that of wild type HBx (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we analyzed the dose dependence of HBx expression plasmid being able to induce cell death or transactivation (Fig. 2, D and E). The 1:1 ratio of pCMVX to pCMVβ induced maximum transactivation activity, although cell death is barely observed in this condition. As to cell death induction, 10 times more HBx expression plasmid is required as compared with maximum transactivation induction. Results clearly indicate that the transactivation ability of HBx is not directly related with its cell death function. A Region of HBx Required for Cell Death and Mitochondrial Localization—As reported previously (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) the mitochondrial localization of HBx caused abnormal aggregation of mitochondria, and as described above, that the transactivation function of HBx is not related to cell death induction, we tried to find out the possibility of whether HBx localization on mitochondria is prerequisite for cell death. We transfected an expression plasmid, pEGFP-HBx, that expresses an EGFP-HBx fusion protein, into HuH7 cells and stained with MitoTracker, a dye selectively stains mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3, 1 day after transfection, EGFP-HBx protein exists all over the cytoplasm, and its location overlaps with the mitochondria. Two to three days after transfection, the localization pattern of EGFP-HBx protein tended to aggregate and gather at the periphery of the nucleus. MitoTracker staining revealed that mitochondria also tended to aggregate at the periphery of the nucleus. This mitochondrial aggregation is co-localized with EGFP-HBx protein. Three to four days after transfection, cells expressing EGFP-HBx protein often show abnormal morphology, round with the membrane blebbing as shown in Fig. 1A. Since EGFP-tagged HBx protein exhibited a similar behavior to that of HBx, we tried to map a region of HBx protein required for localization on mitochondria using plasmid constructs containing EGFP-fused HBx or a series of EGFP-fused HBx mutants (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4EGFP fusion HBx constructs and their localization.A, schematic presentation of EGFP-HBx mutants. As shown in Fig. 2A the regions necessary for transactivation were indicated as black boxes. The region required for cell death inducibility is shown as a blue line. B, amino acid sequence of substitution mutant pEGFP-X(68/117LA). C, the region of HBx required for mitochondrial localization. Fluorescent microscopy of EGFP-HBx proteins is shown. The indicated plasmid was transfected into HuH7 cells, and 2 days after transfection, cells were stained with MitoTracker and monitored under a fluorescent microscopy. The merged images are shown in the right panels. D, cell death inducibility of these EGFP fusion HBx constructs were analyzed as shown in Fig. 1B. The indicated plasmids were transfected into HuH7 cells along with pCMVβ. The mutants, which failed to localize on mitochondria, lacked cell death inducibility.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As shown in Fig. 4C, 2 days after transfection, a small truncation from the C terminus showed decreased affinity to mitochondria. Further truncation from the C terminus of HBx showed less association with mitochondria (compare Fig. 4C, panels c–e). Truncation of the C-terminal half, EGFP-X-(1–67) (Fig. 4C, panel f) completely lost its ability to localize to mitochondria. One mutant only containing the region of aa 68–117 fused to EGFP localized onto mitochondria (Fig. 4C, panel h), suggesting that aa 68–117 are sufficient for the localization onto mitochondria. We tried to obtain a minimally required region for localization on mitochondria, but further deletion of the aa 68–117 region turned out to be exhibiting diffused distribution in the cytoplasm besides mitochondria (data not shown). We then made substitution mutants instead of deletion mutants. Substitutions of basic or acidic amino acid residues in this region did not give any effect on HBx localization. We also substituted leucine to alanine in this region. One or two substitutions of leucine residues gave only a slight affect on its localization (data not shown). However, when residues Cys69, Leu71, Leu89, Leu100, Leu108, and Leu116 were substituted simultaneously with alanine (Fig. 4B), this mutation resulted in loss of mitochondrial localization (Fig. 4C, panel i), suggesting that hydrophobic residues in this region are important for localization of HBx on mitochondria. These HBx plasmid constructs were co-transfected to HuH7 cells with β-galactosidase expression plasmid, and then their cell death-inducing activity was examined. As shown in Fig. 4D, plasmids that expressed proteins locating in mitochondria, pEGFP-HBx, -X(1–117), -X(1–104), -X(1–87), and -X(68–117), were able to induce cell death. On the other hand, plasmids pEGFP-X(1–67), -X(118–154), and -X(68–117LA), which do not express proteins associating with mitochondria, were unable to induce cell death. The cell death inducibility of these proteins is not due to the level of protein expression. Because Western blot analysis showed that the truncation mutants, which are unable to induce cell death, tend to express more proteins in cells than EGFP-HBx (data not shown). Results clearly indicate that mitochondrial localization of HBx as well as its mutant proteins are important for their cell death-inducing activity. Association of HBx with Isolated Mitochondria Is Unable to Release Cytochrome c and AIF—Then we prepared His-tagged recombinant HBx and its mutant proteins (Fig. 5A) and tested their ability to associate with isolated mouse mitochondria in vitro. After 1-h incubation, the reaction mixture was centrifuged, and the precipitated mitochondrial fraction was analyzed by Western blot with anti-His antibody (Fig. 5B). Recombinant HBx-related proteins that contain the aa 68–117 region (rHBx-(aa 1–154) and rX(68–117)) were co-sedimented with mitochondria; however, the mutant protein lacking this region, rX(1–67), was not co-sedimented. Data support a notion that the aa 68–117 region is important for association with mitochondria and is also consistent with the cytochemical data obtained with EGFP-fused HBx constructs (Fig. 4C). On the other hand, the supernatant was analyzed for redistribution of cytochrome c and AIF by Western blot (Fig. 5C). Although cytochrome c and AIF are released from isolated mitochondria after stimulation with CaCl2, as described previously (33Andreyev A. Fiskum G. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), cytochrome c and AIF release from mitochondria are not significantly observed by incubation with recombinant HBx or any HBx mutant proteins. Data indicate that HBx is unable to directly induce cytochrome c and AIF release from isolated mitochondria. As it has been well characterized released cytochrome c, Apaf-1, procaspase-9, and ATP or dATP form a complex, named apoptosome (26Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar), which activates caspase-3, and induces rapid apoptotic cell death. The lack of cytochrome c release suggests that HBx-induced cell death is caspase-3-independent pathway. To confirm this, HuH7 cells were transfected with pCMVX and pCMVβ and were incubated with caspase inhibitors, z-DEVD-fmk or z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 5D). A specific caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk, did not prevent HBxinduced cell death, whereas a general caspase inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk, inhibited HBx-induced cell death in dose-dependent manner. Results clearly indicate that HBx induces cell death through a cytochrome c/caspase-3-independent pathway. Association of HBx with Mitochondria Degenerates Mitochondrial Membrane Potential—The lack of cytochrome c and AIF release from mitochondria suggested that alternative downstream targets are causally involved in cell death. As we reported previously (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that decreased mitochondrial membrane potential was observed after expression of HBx, we next tested whether localization of HBx on mitochondria is directly relevant to decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. A cytochemical analysis was carried out to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential by a fluorescent dye, 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1) staining, which is a reliable and sensitive method to analyze ΔΨ changes of mitochondria. JC-1 emits at 527 nm after excitation at 490 nm in monomeric form, and in the presence of a high ΔΨ, JC-1 forms so called J-aggregates that are associated with a large shift in emission to 590 nm (34Reers M. Smiley S.T. Mottola-Hartshorn C. Chen A. Lin M. Chen L.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 35Salvioli S. Ardizzoni A. Franceschi C. Cossarizza A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). To analyze mitochondrial membrane potential by JC-1, EBFP-fused HBx constructs were utilized to avoid interference of the green fluorescence with JC-1 staining. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of pEBFP-HBx and -X(68–117) (Fig. 6, b and d) (these proteins were localized on mitochondria), caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas expression of pEBFP-X(1–67) (Fig. 6c) did not induce any change of mitochondrial membrane potential. Data indicate that association of HBx with mitochondria brings about decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. Stabilization of ΔΨmby PTP Inhibitors, ROS Scavengers, and Bcl-xLRescues Cells from HBx-induced Cell Death—If decreased mitochondrial membrane potential is a prerequisite to HBx-induced cell death, stabilization of ΔΨm is expected to prevent HBx-induced cell death. To assess this hypothesis, two PTP inhibitors, bongkrekic acid and cyclosporin A, which stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, were subjected to analysis of HBx-induced cell death. After DNA transfection, these reagents were added to the culture medium, and cell death was monitored 3 days after transfection. As shown in Fig. 7, A and B, both PTP inhibitors prevented cells from HBx-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that decreased mitochondrial membrane potential is a major cause of HBx-induced cell death. It has been reported that decreased mitochondrial membrane potential results in a variety of deleterious sequeale including generation of ROS and decreased production of ATP. As the generation of ROS has been shown to accelerate cell death events, we analyzed effects of ROS scavenger, NAC, and Tiron on HBx-induced cell death. As shown in Fig. 7, C and D, these ROS scavengers, NAC and Tiron, also clearly prevented cells from HBx-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Data strongly suggest that HBx association with mitochondria opens the PTP complex and causes ROS generation, resulting in cell death. As it is known that anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential and protect cells from apoptosis, if HBx induces loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, excess expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protect cells from HBx-induced cell death. A Bcl-xL expression plasmid was co-transfected with HBx expression plasmid, and then the extent of cell death was analyzed. Fig. 7E clearly shows that expression of Bcl-xL protein prevents cells from dying under the conditions of HBx expression in dose-dependent manner, confirming that loss of mitochondrial membrane potential is principally related to HBx-induced cell death. To further confirm that the above reagents preserve mitochondrial membrane potential under the conditions used, HuH7 cells are transfected with pEBFP-X and incubated with 50 μm bongkrekic acid (Fig. 8b). Although cells transfected with HBx expression plasmid showed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 8a), incubation with bongkrekic acid protected cells from degeneration of mitochondrial membrane potential. As shown Fig. 8b, some HBx-expressing cells treated with bongkrekic acid show high mitochondrial membrane potential even after their mitochondria are aggregated. These HBx-expressing cells with high ΔΨm were not observed without bongkrekic acid incubation. The expression of Bcl-xL also exhibited a similar effect on stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 8d). Data also strongly suggested that destabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential, which opens the PTP complex, is the main cause of HBx-induced cell death. First, the present results provided strong evidences that HBx-induced cell death is connected to localization of HBx on mitochondria. We mapped that aa 68–117 are sufficient for HBx localization on mitochondria and cell death induction. Our data clearly show that cell death induced by HBx is independent of its transactivation activity. Although several groups have pointed out that the pro-apoptotic effect of HBx correlates with its transactivation activity (23Bergametti F. Prigent S. Luber B. Benoit A. Tiollais P. Sarasin A. Transy C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2860-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36Sirma H. Giannini C. Poussin K. Paterlini P. Kremsdorf D. Brechot C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4848-4859Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 37Schuster R. Gerlich W.H. Schaefer S. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), our result indicates that the transactivation ability of HBx is not required for its cell death activity, suggesting that the mechanism of HBxinduced cell death is not due to transactivation of the cell death-promoting genes, such as bax. Previously we reported that expression of HBx induced partial release of cytochrome c from aggregated mitochondria (1Takada S. Shirakata Y. Kaneniwa N. Koike K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6965-6973Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Compared with pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax, cytochrome c release induced by HBx is a relatively late event. Although HBx localized on mitochondria right after its expression, cytochrome c release from aggregated mitochondria was only observed 3 days after transfection. Although cytochrome c release was observed from a part of aggregated mitochondria, the majority of mitochondria still preserve cytochrome c. Our analysis in this paper revealed that HBx association with isolated mitochondria did not cause redistribution of cytochrome c and AIF. These results suggested that HBx-induced cell death is dependent on mitochondria, but independent of caspase-3. Involvement of other caspase(s) remains to be analyzed. In general, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization is a near-universal hallmark and a critical step of several apoptotic pathways (25Kroemer G. Reed J.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). During the decision or commitment phase of apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane permeabilization differentially affects the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria. Outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization becomes protein-permeable and then releases proteins that reside in the intermembrane space, such as cytochrome c and AIF. The redistribution of cytochrome c through the outer mitochondrial membrane is the critical event responsible for mitochondria-dependent caspase activation. The inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization continues to retain matrix proteins, but dissipates the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Our data show that HBx does not significantly release cytochrome c and AIF from the mitochondrial intermembrane space in vitro, although the association of HBx with mitochondria caused decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in vivo. These observations suggest that HBx only affects the inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization but not the outer membrane permeabilization. Furthermore, we showed that PTP inhibitors, ROS scavengers and Bcl-xL, which stabilize mitochondrial membrane potential, rescued cells from HBx-induced cell death, strongly supporting the idea that decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, the inner membrane permeabilization, is the major cause of HBx-induced cell death. Although the temporary order of outer and inner mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, as well as their relative contribution to cell death, are still a matter of debate, the HBx-induced cell death shows that the inner membrane permeabilization of mitochondria is implicated in cell death. We examined the possibility that if HBx and Bcl-xL proteins physically interact with the same mitochondrial protein using isolated mouse liver mitochondria, we could not see any competition between these proteins in their association with mitochondria (data not shown). This suggests that Bcl-xL is able to indirectly prevent HBx-induced cell death, such as stabilization of mitochondrial membrane potential. It has been shown that several viral and bacterial proteins regulate cell death at the mitochondrial level by targeting proteins to mitochondrial membranes. Rahmani et al. (2Rahmani Z. Huh K.W. Lasher R. Siddiqui A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2840-2846Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) reported that HBx interacts with one particular voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) isoform, VDAC-3, by a yeast two-hybrid system. The VDAC is one of the PTP complex proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Our results suggested that HBx affects only inner membrane permeabilization, but it is possible to speculate that the interaction of HBx with VDAC-3 may cause inner membrane permeabilization. Programmed cell death or apoptosis plays a major role in normal development and physiology as well as in many pathological states. Malfunctions of apoptosis have been implicated in many human diseases such as cancer, neurodegenarative disease, AIDS, and ischemic stroke (38Dragunow M. MacGibbon G.A. Lawlor P. Butterworth N.

It is plausible that during the stage of chronic HBV infection, HBx expression may induce or sensitize apoptosis in infected hepatocytes generating HBV pathogenesis such as inflammation and favor propagation of the viral particles.

https://openalex.org/W2011209855,"Oxidant stress and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activation have been implicated in numerous proinflammatory responses of the mesangial cell (MC). We investigated the cross-talk between group IVα cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2α) and secretory PLA2s (sPLA2s) during H2O2-induced arachidonic acid (AA) release using two types of murine MC: (i) MC+/+, which lack group IIa and V PLA2s, and (ii) MC–/–, which lack groups IIa, V, and IVα PLA2s. H2O2-induced AA release was greater in MC+/+ compared with MC–/–. It has been argued that cPLA2α plays a regulatory role enhancing the activity of sPLA2s, which act on phospholipids to release fatty acid. Group IIa, V, or IVα PLA2s were expressed in MC–/– or MC+/+ using recombinant adenovirus vectors. Expression of cPLA2α in H2O2-treated MC–/– increased AA release to a level approaching that of H2O2-treated MC+/+. Expression of either group IIa PLA2 or V PLA2 enhanced AA release in MC+/+ but had no effect on AA release in MC–/–. When sPLA2 and cPLA2α are both present, the effect of H2O2 is manifested by preferential release of AA compared with oleic acid. Inhibition of the ERK and protein kinase C signaling pathways with the MEK-1 inhibitor, U0126, and protein kinase C inhibitor, GF 1092030x, respectively, and chelating intracellular free calcium with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoyl)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-AM, which also reduced ERK1/2 activation, significantly reduced H2O2-induced AA release in MC+/+ expressing either group IIa or V PLA2s. By contrast, H2O2-induced AA release was not enhanced when ERK1/2 was activated by infection of MC+/+ with constitutively active MEK1-DD. We conclude that the effect of group IIa and V PLA2s on H2O2-induced AA release is dependent upon the presence of cPLA2α and the activation of PKC and ERK1/2.

Several mammalian intracellular and small molecular weight (13,000–16,000) secretory PLA2s (sPLA2) have been characterized and classified into different groups (1Kudo I. Murakami M. Hara S. Inoue K.

Non-secretory PLA2s include the Ca2+-sensitive arachidonoyl-selective 85-kDa group IVα cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2α) (5Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Google Scholar, 6Bonventre J.V. J.

A number of mammalian sPLA2s have been identified to date (groups IB, IIA, IIC, IID, IIE, IIF, III, V, X, and XII) and they display distinct yet partially overlapping tissue distributions (4Murakami M.

Whereas cPLA2α has a preferential effect on AA-containing membrane phospholipids as compared with those containing other fatty acids, sPLA2s do not exhibit acyl chain specificity.

The understanding of which forms of PLA2 are important for AA release and how multiple forms may interact has been hampered by the fact that mammalian cells generally contain more than one form of PLA2. Furthermore, various PLA2 inhibitors and antisense approaches lack specificity and/or efficacy even though much useful information has been derived from these approaches (15Balsinde J.

Thus the understanding of specific interactions of PLA2 enzymes contributing to AA release and metabolite production is complex and has been difficult to clarify. Cellular kinase signal transduction pathways have been implicated in PLA2 activation and its downstream effects. cPLA2α is regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation and by calcium (5Leslie C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16709-16712Google Scholar). cPLA2α contains an N-terminal calcium-dependent phospholipid binding domain.

Reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the response of mesangial cells to hyperglycemia (38Catherwood M.A. Powell L.A. Anderson P. McMaster D. Sharpe P.C. Trimble E.R. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 599-608Google Scholar) and increased levels of prostaglandins are characteristic of diabetic and other glomerulopathies (39Mahadevan P. Larkins R.G. Fraser J.R. Dunlop M.E.

The role of PLA2s in the generation of eicosanoids and propagation of inflammation has been extensively studied by several groups using mesangial cells derived from rats. Our laboratory has produced a mouse line with the cPLA2α gene mutated (41Bonventre J.V. Huang Z. Taheri M.R. O'Leary E. Li E. Moskowitz M.A. Sapirstein A. Nature. 1997; 390: 622-625Google Scholar). The mouse strains (C57b/6 and SV/129) used to construct the cPLA2α–/– strain have spontaneous null mutations in the gene encoding group IIa PLA2 (42Kennedy B.P. Payette P. Mudgett J. Vadas P. Pruzanski W. Kwan M. Tang C. Rancourt D.E. Cromlish W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22378-22385Google Scholar). In addition to group IIa PLA2, our murine mesangial cells do not express group V PLA2 under quiescent or stimulated conditions, unlike rat mesangial cells, which are known to synthesize group IIa and V PLA2s upon stimulation of the cells with cytokines (43van der Helm H.A. Aarsman A.J. Janssen M.J.W. Neys F.W. van den Bosch H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1484: 215-224Google Scholar). Two types of MC were used: (i) cPLA2α+/+ MC (MC+/+), which lack group IIa and V PLA2s and (ii) cPLA2α–/– MC (MC–/–), which lack group IIa, V, and IVα PLA2s. We expressed group IVα, IIa, and V PLA2 proteins in MC–/– and MC+/+ with recombinant adenoviral vectors. Using this approach we dissect the specific roles played by cPLA2α and the sPLA2s in the mediation of H2O2-induced AA release in mesangial cells. To better define the cross-talk between cPLA2α and sPLA2s during oxidant stress, we examined the effect of expression of various forms of PLA2 on H2O2-induced AA release in murine mesangial cells. This is the first time that the cross-talk between cPLA2α and sPLA2s in a mammalian cell has been studied by utilizing recombinant adenovirus and cPLA2α knockout MC, which lack group IIa, V, and IVα PLA2s. We report here that group IIa and V PLA2s potentiate H2O2-induced AA release in a cPLA2α-, PKC-, and ERK1/2-dependent manner. Activation of ERK1/2 is necessary but not sufficient for H2O2-mediated AA release. We conclude that in murine mesangial cells, cPLA2α is the major enzyme responsible for AA release whereas sPLA2 serves an amplifying role.

Moreover, they stain positively for the intermediate filaments desmin and vimentin, which are considered to be specific for myogenic cells. Passages 6–10 of MC were used for the reported experiments. Analysis of mRNA Expression of Group V PLA2in MC—Total RNA was extracted from mesangial cells by using Ultraspec (Biotecx, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers derived from the 5′ (5′-CAGGGGGCTTGCTAGAACTCAA-3′) and 3′ (5′-AAGAGGGTTGTAAGTCCAGAGG-3′) ends of the coding region of the mouse group V PLA2 were used in a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to clone the mouse group V PLA2 cDNA. The reverse transcriptase reaction was carried out after 10 min incubation at 70 °C of denatured template and dNTP with 10 pmol of reverse primer and then incubated with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 1 h at 42 °C to generate a cDNA template for PCR. The PCR was carried out for 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min in buffer with 0.5 units of Taq polymerase. The amplified products were resolved in 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. The expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as internal control. Total PLA2and iPLA2Assay—MC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by sonication in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 9. The lysate was centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Total PLA2 activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of free fatty acid released from the substrate [14C]PE. Each reaction mixture consisted of an aliquot of the required sample, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the [14C]PE released was extracted by Dole's method and the radioactivity was counted (44Sapirstein A. Spech R.A. Witzgall R. Bonventre J.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21505-21513Google Scholar). For the iPLA2 assay, lysate was preincubated with various concentrations of BEL (iPLA2 inhibitor) for 10 min and then iPLA2 activity was assayed by measuring the amounts of free fatty acid released from the substrate [14C]PE. Each reaction mixture consisted of an aliquot of the sample, 75 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EGTA, and 2 μm substrate. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, the [14C]PE released was extracted by Dole's method and the radioactivity was counted. Arachidonic and Oleic Acid Release—Confluent MC in 12-well plates were labeled for 14–16 h either with 0.15 μCi of [3H]AA (specific activity: 1 Ci = 37 GBq) or 0.15 μCi of [14C]OA (specific activity: 1 Ci = 38 GBq) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 with 0.2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. After labeling, the medium was removed, and cells were washed three times with RPMI containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. To measure H2O2-induced AA or OA release, cells were exposed to 75 μm H2O2 or vehicle in RPMI, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 3 to6hat37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2. The medium was removed and centrifuged to remove detached cells. The cells were solubilized with 1 ml of 0.5% NaOH. The radioactivity in 800 μl of supernatant and cells was measured in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of [3H]AA or [14C]OA released into the medium was expressed as a percentage of the total (cell-associated plus released). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Total MC extracts were harvested with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaVO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 μm leupeptin, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate) and mixed with 6× sample buffer. Fifteen micrograms of cell extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gel), and proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes for 1 h at 400 mA using a Bio-Rad transblot apparatus. The transfer buffer used was 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 384 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS, and 20% methanol. After the transfer, the membrane was blocked with a buffer containing: 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% nonfat dry milk, and 0.5% Tween 20. The membrane was incubated with primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, respectively. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Measurement of Intracellular Free Calcium Concentration—Intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) was determined with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye Fura-2 according to Cheung et al. (45Cheung J.Y. Constantine J.M. Bonventre J.V. Am. J. Physiol. 1986; 251: F690-F701Google Scholar) with modification. Cells grown on coverslips coated with bovine collagen type I were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and loaded with 3 μm Fura-2AM in Earle's balanced salt solution. Pluronic F-127 (20%) at 1:1000 (v/v) dilution was added to Fura-2AM to facilitate cell loading. In addition, 2 mm probenecid was added to minimize intracellular compartment transport or extrusion of Fura-2-free acid. Cells were loaded with Fura-2AM for 1 h at 37 °C and washed 2–3 times with Earle's balanced salt solution containing probenecid. The coverslips were positioned in a quartz cuvette containing 3.5 ml of Earle's balanced salt solution with probencid for fluorescence analysis using a Shimadzu RF-5000 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD). [Ca2+]i was calculated as equal to Kd (224 nm) × (R – Rmin)/(Rmax – R) according to Grykiewicz et al. (46Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar) as described previously. Fluorescence emission was monitored at 505 nm. R is the ratio (F1/F2) of the fluorescence at excitation 340 nm to that at excitation 380 nm. Construction of Recombinant Adenovirus Vectors Carrying the cDNA of Group IIa and V PLA2—The system for generation of recombinant adenoviruses has been described previously (47He T.C. Zhou S.S. Costa L.T.D. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Google Scholar). Briefly the mouse V PLA2 cDNA (500-base pair HindIII/XbaI restriction fragment) and human IIa PLA2 cDNA (780-base pair KPN1/XhoI restriction fragment) were subcloned into a shuttle vector (pAdTrack-CMV). The shuttle vector plasmid was linearized with PmeI (restriction endonuclease) and transformed together with supercoiled adenoviral backbone vector (pAdEasy-1) into Escherichia coli strain BJ5183 by electroporation in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser electroporator. Recombinants were selected with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and screened by restriction endonuclease digestions (PacI, SpeI, and BamHI). The recombinant adenoviral construct was transformed into DH 5α cells for large scale amplification by electroporation and was purified by CsCl banding. For production of adenoviruses in mammalian cells, the recombinant adenoviral construct linearized by PacI was transfected into 293 cells using LipofectAMINE and Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The process of viral production was monitored by visualization of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, which is incorporated into the viral backbone. Viruses were harvested after 7–10 days. The viruses were purified by CsCl banding and viral particles were measured by optical density (OD) (viral particles = OD × dilution factor (usually 10) × 1012). The recombinant adenoviral vectors carrying the cDNA of cPLA2α (Ad-cPLA2α), cDNA of GFP/E. coli LacZ gene encoding β-galactosidase (Ad-GFP/LacZ) as an adenovirus control, and cDNA of constitutively active MEK1-DD (Ad-MEK1-DD) were constructed as previously described in our laboratory (48Choukroun G.J. Marshansky V. Gustafson C.E. Mckee M. Hajjar R.J. Rosenzweig A. Brown D. Bonventre J.V. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 983-993Google Scholar, 49Choukroun G. Hajjar R. Kyriakis J.M. Bonventre J.V. Rosenzweig A. Force T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1311-1320Google Scholar). Introduction of PLA2Enzymes into Primary Murine Mesangial Cells—Subconfluent MC were infected with adenoviral vectors at varying levels of infection, as reflected by plaque forming units/cell, for 48 h in RPMI 1640 with 2% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. The adenovirus-mediated gene transfers were followed by the expression of GFP under UV light for Ad-IIa and VPLA2s and Ad-GFP/LacZ, and by Western blot analysis of cell lysate for Ad-cPLA2α and Ad-MEK1-DD, respectively. After confirming the infection, cells were used for experiments. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical differences among the groups were calculated on raw data using the analysis of variance test. Significance was tested using Student's t test between groups. A value of p < 0.05 was chosen to determine statistical significance. Each experiment was performed in triplicate and independently three to five times. Expression of cPLA2α and Its Effect on H2O2-induced AA Release in MC–/–—MC–/– were infected with Ad-cPLA2α. Seventy-two hours after infection, total cell extracts were collected to confirm expression of the cPLA2α in MC–/– by Western blotting. Fig. 1A shows the expression of cPLA2α in a dose-dependent manner after Ad-cPLA2α infection at different multiplicity of infections (m.o.i.) in MC–/–. At the sites of inflammation, H2O2 levels can reach relatively high local concentrations (range from 0.1 to 1.0 mm) in the presence of activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (50Homan-Muller J.W. Weening R.S. Roos D. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1975; 85: 198-207Google Scholar, 51Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1550-1560Google Scholar, 52Negri M. Bellavite P. Lauciello C. Guzzo P. Zatti M. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 199: 305-310Google Scholar). To study the effect of cPLA2α on H2O2-induced AA release from MC, MC–/– infected with varying m.o.i. of Ad-cPLA2α, were stimulated with 75 μm H2O2 for periods of 3 and 6 h and AA released into media was measured (Fig. 1B). The elevation of AA release was dependent on Ad-cPLA2α m.o.i. and exposure time to H2O2. Expression of cPLA2α in H2O2-treated MC–/– significantly increased AA release at 3 and 6 h. H2O2 at a concentration of 75 μm did not result in cellular injury as monitored by trypan blue staining and lactate dehydrogenase release (data not shown). Expression of Group IIa and V PLA2s in MC—The mouse strains (C57b/6 and SV/129) used to construct the cPLA2α–/– strain have spontaneous null mutations in the gene encoding group IIa PLA2. Furthermore, MC derived from cPLA2α+/+ (MC+/+) and cPLA2α–/– (MC–/–) mice, which have mixed C57b/6 and SV/129 backgrounds, do not express group V PLA2 mRNA under quiescent or stimulated conditions (Fig. 2A). MC+/+ and MC–/– were infected with Ad-sPLA2. Seventy-two hours after infection, total cell extracts were collected to confirm expression of the sPLA2s in MC by Western blotting. Fig. 2B shows the dose-dependent expression of either group IIa or V PLA2s after Ad-IIa PLA2 or Ad-V PLA2 infection at different m.o.i. in MC+/+. Infection with adenovirus expressing the GFP/LacZ enzyme had no effect upon the levels of either of the PLA2s. This indicates that the infection process is not associated with endogenous sPLA2 expression. Fig. 2C shows that there is an increase in total PLA2 activity in Ad-IIaPLA2, Ad-V PLA2-infected unstimulated MC. No increase in activity is seen in cells infected with Ad-GFP/LacZ compared with uninfected cells. LY311727, which selectively inhibits group IIa (53Schevitz R.W. Bach N.J. Carlson D.G. Chirgadze N.Y. Clawson D.K. Dillard R.D. Draheim S.E. Hartley L.W. Jones N.D. Mihelich E.D. Olkowski J.L. Snyder D.W. Sommers C. Wery J.P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 458-465Google Scholar) and group V PLA2 activity (54Yang H.C. Mosior M. Johnson C.A. Chen Y. Dennis E.A. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 269: 278-288Google Scholar), completely inhibited the increased total PLA2 activity in the Ad-IIa- or Ad-V PLA2-infected cells. Role of Cellular Group IIa and V PLA2s in the H2O2-induced AA Release—To evaluate potential interactions between sPLA2s and cPLA2α during the H2O2-induced AA release, sPLA2s enzymes were expressed in MC+/+ and MC–/– using recombinant adenoviral vectors encoding group IIa PLA2 (Ad-IIa PLA2) or V PLA2 (Ad-V PLA2). Fig. 3A shows that H2O2-induced AA release is significantly increased when MC+/+ are infected with either Ad-IIa PLA2 (m.o.i. = 50) or Ad-V PLA2 (m.o.i. = 50). Ad-IIa or Ad-V PLA2s has no effect, however, on AA release in MC–/– (Fig. 3B). Neither group IIa nor V PLA2s have any effect on unstimulated AA release levels in MC+/+ and MC–/–. Fig. 3C shows that Ad-GFP/LacZ (m.o.i. = 40) infection had no effect on H2O2-induced AA release when compared with non-infected groups. Thus adenovirus infection itself had no effect upon AA release. Role of Cellular sPLA2in the H2O2-induced OA Release— Because, unlike cPLA2α, sPLA2 does not have a preferential effect on AA-containing membrane phospholipid"
https://openalex.org/W2081846733,"Equinatoxin II is a representative of actinoporins, eukaryotic pore-forming toxins from sea anemones. It creates pores in natural and artificial lipid membranes by an association of three or four monomers. Cysteine-scanning mutagenesis was used to study the structure of the N terminus, which is proposed to be crucial in transmembrane pore formation. We provide data for two steps of pore formation: a lipid-bound monomeric intermediate state and a final oligomeric pore. Results show that residues 10–28 are organized as an α-helix in both steps. In the first step, the whole region is transferred to a lipid-water interface, laying flat on the membrane. In the pore-forming state, the hydrophilic side of the amphipathic helix lines the pore lumen. The pore has a restriction around Asp-10, according to the permeabilization ratio of ions flowing through pores formed by chemically modified mutants. A general model was introduced to derive the tilt angle of the helix from the ion current data. This study reveals that actinoporins use a unique single helix insertion mechanism for pore formation.

Pore-forming toxins (PFT) 1The abbreviations used are: PFT, pore-forming toxins; DPhPC, 1,2 diphytanoyl-sn-3-glycerophosphocholine; DPPC, 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; DTT, dithiothreitol; EqtII, equinatoxin II; IANBD, N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; L/T, lipid/toxin; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate; 7-NO-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(7-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; PLM, planar lipid membrane; SM, sphingomyelin; SUV, small unilamellar vesicles; WT, wild-type. are considered as a link between soluble and membrane proteins (1Gouaux E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 566-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These proteins, produced in a soluble form, act upon target cell membranes by forming transmembrane channels. During this toxic action they adapt their structure to expose the hydrophobic parts needed for membrane association and pore formation. PFT can be divided according to the transmembrane structural elements of the final inserted state. Some bacterial PFT form stable oligomeric β-barrels (2Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9065-9073Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Examples include α-toxin from Staphylococcus aureus (3Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar), a family of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from Gram-positive bacteria (4Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K.

Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), and others. PFT pores lined by α-helices (similar to colicins) (6Lakey J.H. Slatin S.L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2001; 257: 131-161PubMed Google Scholar) are fewer and less well understood, largely because of the inherent instability of the resulting pores. One interesting family of PFT is that of the actinoporins of sea anemones (7Anderluh G. Maček P. Toxicon. 2002; 40: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). They are closely related cysteine-less proteins that form pores in natural and artificial lipid membranes. Their peculiar three-dimensional structure and biochemical properties reveal them to form an entirely novel class of PFT (8Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Hinds M.G. Zhang W. Anderluh G. Hansen P.E. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). They are one-domain proteins; smaller than bacterial PFT, they lyse erythrocytes at picomolar concentrations and exhibit sphingomyelin dependence. The most studied representative is equinatoxin II (EqtII), an actinoporin from Actinia equina. EqtII is composed of a tightly folded β-sandwich flanked on two sides by α-helices (Fig. 1A) (8Athanasiadis A. Anderluh G. Maček P. Turk D. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 341-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 9Hinds M.G. Zhang W. Anderluh G. Hansen P.E. Norton R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 315: 1219-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The first 30 N-terminal residues, encompassing the N-terminal α-helix (residues 16–26 from the crystal and NMR structures), is the only part that can be dislocated from the body of the molecule without disrupting the β-sandwich (Fig. 1B). Pore formation by EqtII is a multistep process (Fig. 1C). It was shown recently that the toxin binds to the lipid bilayer with the aromatic amino acid cluster located on a broad loop at the bottom of the molecule and on the C-terminal α-helix (10Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11Hong Q. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K.

In the next step an N-terminal segment translocates to the lipid-water interface (10Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 12Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and, finally, a transmembrane pore is formed by helices from three or four monomers as proposed by Belmonte et al. (13Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The final pore is not a rigid structure, like the stable β-barrels of bacterial PFT that can be studied by x-ray crystallography or electron microscopy (3Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar, 5Petosa C. Collier R.J. Klimpel K.R. Leppla S.H. Liddington R.C. Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Actinoporin pores are not resistant to SDS and have not yet been directly visualized. The number of monomers in the pore was deduced by cross-linking and kinetic experiments (13Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). According to helical wheel analysis, the whole region of residues 10–28, including the N-terminal α-helix, is amphipathic and could be involved in forming the walls of the functional pore (Fig. 1B) (15Belmonte G. Menestrina G. Pederzolli C. Križaj I. Gubenšek F. Turk T. Maček P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1192: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This region is highly conserved in all known actinoporins. In particular, the hydrophobic face is almost completely conserved, while on the polar face the most conserved are negatively charged residues (i.e. Asp-10, Asp-17, and Asp-24), which could account for the cation selectivity of actinoporins. We decided to study the topology of this important region in its membrane environment by employing cysteine-scanning mutagenesis. This approach proved to be useful in obtaining detailed structural information of membrane regions of some PFT (16Valeva A. Walev I. Pinkernell M. Walker B. Bayley H. Palmer M. Bhakdi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11607-11611Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

A desired amino acid is changed to a cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis in a protein that normally does not possess any surface-exposed, and therefore reactive, cysteines. Extrinsic labels can then be covalently attached to this unique thiol group; thus giving the site-specific information about their immediate environment (19Heuck A.P. Johnson A.E. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 36: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We have already performed low resolution cysteine-scanning mutagenesis, where regions of EqtII that interact with the lipid membranes were determined (12Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In the current work we performed a detailed scanning of the region from Asp-10 to Asn-28. Mutants were modified with thiol reactive reagents and assayed by fluorescence spectroscopy and electrophysiological methods to determine the structural arrangement of this N-terminal region at each stage of pore formation. Results indicate that the whole region is transferred to the lipid-water interface during the initial binding and that the same region forms the walls of the final pore in an α-helical arrangement. Cloning, Expression, and Isolation of Cysteine Mutants—Single cysteine mutants were produced by substituting the corresponding wild-type (WT) amino acid residue with cysteine as described (12Anderluh G. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Pungerčar J. Gubenšek F. Zecchini M.L. Dalla Serra M. Menestrina G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 128-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Mutants were expressed from a T7-based expression vector in Escherichia coli BLR(DE3) strain and recombinant proteins purified from bacterial supernatants as described (20Anderluh G. Pungerčar J. Štrukelj B. Maček P. Gubenšek F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 220: 437-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). S13C, D17C, and E24C were prepared as fusion proteins using His-tagged third domain of TolA (TolAIII, a bacterial periplasmic protein) as a fusion partner. They were expressed in E. coli using the pTolT plasmid and purified from bacterial supernatants by Ni-chelate chromatography (21Anderluh G. Gokce I. Lakey J.H. Prot. Exp. Purif. 2002; 28: 173-181Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar). All mutants were purified to homogeneity as observed on SDS-PAGE gels. Characterization of Mutants—Mutants were tested for hemolytic activity using a microplate reader (MRX; Dynex Technologies, Dekendorf, Germany). The percentage of hemolysis was determined as described (10Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In short, bovine red blood cells (100 μl, OD630 = 0.5) were added to 2-fold serially diluted mutants in 100 μl of 0.13 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and hemolysis was monitored by measuring absorbance at 630 nm for 20 min at room temperature. The ability of mutants to bind to bovine red blood cells and small unilamellar vesicles (SUV), with or without 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-(7-doxyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (7-NO-PC), at a lipid/toxin (L/T) ratio of 1:1000 was determined from the residual hemolytic activity as described (10Malovrh P.

In this test, unbound protein is detected by hemolysis assay by adding fresh erythrocytes at the end of the incubation. Hemolytic activity is observed only, when unbound protein is present in the sample (10Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The amount of unbound toxin was determined from the calibration curves obtained using purified mutants. For the bovine erythrocytes assay toxins, at a final 76 nm concentration, were preincubated with erythrocytes for 10 min. Thereafter, a fresh suspension of erythrocytes was added, and hemolysis measured as described above. To assay binding to SUV, 100 μl of sample after fluorescence assays (see below) was mixed with 100 μl of erythrocytes, and activity was measured as described above. IANBD Labeling—Typically, 0.5–1 mg of protein was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.1, with dithiothreitol (DTT) (toxin/DTT molar ratio 1:1) for 30 min at room temperature. Thereafter, N-((2-(iodoacetoxy)ethyl)-N-methyl)amino-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (IANBD) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), in 5× molar excess over DTT and toxin, was added. The mixture was incubated on a magnetic stirrer at 4 °C overnight. Labeled proteins were separated from unlabeled by using a hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) column (Brownlee, Aquapore) as described. The extent of protein modification was calculated from the relative areas of the two peaks that appeared at 280 nm. The first one corresponded to the unmodified and the second one to the labeled mutant. S13C, D17C, and E24C were “on-column” labeled as TolAIII fusion proteins. 0.5 ml of Ni-NTA gel slurry (Qiagen, Crawley) was placed in the column and washed with 5 ml of 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. For each mutant a few milligrams of protein were incubated in the above buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Afterwards, they were applied to the column and washed with 10 ml of the same buffer without β-mercaptoethanol. Bound mutant protein was washed with 4 ml of 5 mm IANBD and incubated in the dark at room temperature for 4 h. After labeling, the column was washed with 15 ml of enterokinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4). Enterokinase (Novagen) was then added (30 units for 1 mg of protein) and incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Cleaved labeled mutants were washed from the column by 20 mm NaH2PO4, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and purified using FPLC and a MonoS ion-exchange chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). Chemical Modification Using Methanethiosulfonate Derivatives (MTS)—Mutants were chemically modified with MTS reagents to introduce, at the thiol group, either a positive or a negative charge with (2-aminoethyl) MTS hydrobromide (MTSEA) and sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) MTS (MTSES), respectively (both from Biotium, Inc. Fremont, CA). Mutants were preincubated overnight in a 20 molar excess of DTT. MTS reagents, freshly dissolved in H2O, were then added at 1000 molar excess to 10–50 μm mutants. After a 1-h incubation at room temperature, after which all the excess reagent had hydrolyzed, the modified samples were used for PLM experiments. Preparation of Lipid Vesicles—All lipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared from brain sphingomyelin (SM) and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) at a 1:1 molar ratio. Liposomes used in lipophilic quenching experiments were prepared by using SM and DPPC, except that 20 mol% of DPPC were replaced by 7-NO-PC. Chloroform was removed by a rotary evaporator. Vesicle buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) was added to the lipid film, and the suspension was vigorously vortex-mixed in the presence of glass beads. The resulting multilamellar vesicles were converted to SUV by sonication (MSE 150W ultrasonic disintegrator) of suspension at room temperature. The SUV suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min to remove titanium particles released from the probe. Vesicles were stored at 4 °C immediately after the preparation and used the next day. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—All fluorescence measurements were performed on a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco Corporation, Japan). The sample compartment was equipped with a Peltier thermostatted single-cell holder. All experiments were done at 25 °C at a protein concentration of 250 nm. The excitation and emission slits were set to 5 nm. Tryptophan emission spectra were measured in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and spectra were recorded from 310–400 nm. NBD-labeled mutants in 140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.5 were excited at 470 nm, and the emission was scanned from 500–600 nm. Subsequently, the appropriate amount of SUV, with or without 7-NO-PC, at the final L/T ratio of 1000 was added, and the NBD emission was scanned again. The spectra were corrected for the dilution factor, and the background was subtracted using the appropriate blank with SUV. No further correction for wavelength dependence of the photomultiplier tube was done. The λmax was determined from the corrected spectra by Spectra Analysis software (part of Spectra Manager 1.53.00; Jasco Corporation). Quenching with 7-NO-PC and Iodide—The quenching efficiency, E, for the quenching of NBD emission by 7-NO-PC was calculated as follows in Equation 1, E=1−(Fquench/Fsuv)(Eq. 1) where Fquench and Fsuv represent the normalized fluorescence of IANBD at 530 nm in the presence of SUV with or without 7-NO-PC, respectively. For quenching with iodide ions, a 2.5 m stock solution of KI in 1 mm Na2S2O3 was freshly prepared prior to each experiment. The aliquots from the stock solution were added to 250 nm final NBD-labeled protein with or without the presence of SUV (L/T ratio 1000). NBD emission spectra were measured as described above. They were corrected for the emission of buffer or buffer with vesicles and for the dilution factor. The data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation shown in Equation 2, F0/F=1+KSV[Q](Eq. 2) where F0 is the fluorescence of the probe in the absence of the quencher, F is the observed fluorescence, [Q] is the concentration of iodide ions, and KSV is the collisional quenching constant. Electrical Recordings of Ion Channel Activity—Electrical properties of unmodified and MTS-modified mutants were studied on planar lipid membrane (PLM) made of 1,2 diphytanoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine (DPhPC) and 20% (w/w) of SM, both from Avanti Polar Lipids. Mutants were added on one side (cis) to stable preformed bilayers. All experiments were started in symmetrical solutions (10 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, pH 8.0). For the selectivity determination a 10-fold KCl gradient was formed, whereby the higher concentration was on the trans side, which was held at virtual ground. Macroscopic currents were recorded by a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch 200, Axon Instruments). A PC equipped with a DigiData 1200 A/D converter (Axon Instruments) was used for data acquisitions. The current traces were filtered at 0.1 kHz and acquired by the computer using Axoscope 8 software (Axon Instruments). Measurements were performed at room temperature. Derivation of Helix Orientation Inside the Pore—The selectivity of the pore in MTS modification experiments was analyzed in terms of a model that relates it to the potential generated by the introduced charges. In fact these charges generate a local field at the entrance of the pore that attracts and concentrates counter ions, and therefore the partial conductance Gi of the ion species i through the pore, can be written as in Equation 3 (22Schultz S.G. Basic Principles of Membrane Transport. Cambridge University Press, New York1980Google Scholar), Gi=Kui|zi|eci(Eq. 3) where ui, zi, and ci are the mobility, valence, and local concentration of the ion i, e is the elementary charge, and K a geometrical constant (in the simplest form K = πr2/l where r and l are radius and length of the pore). The local concentration ci derives from the bulk concentration cio through Equation 4, ci=cioexp(−ziψ'pore)(Eq. 4) where Ψ′pore is the reduced potential at the center of the pore entrance (i.e. Ψ′pore/(kT/e), with k, Boltzmann constant, T, absolute temperature). From this, in the case of 1:1 salt like KCl we used, one can derive the selectivity index in Equation 5, P+/P−=G+/G−=(u+/u−)exp(−2ψ'pore)(Eq. 5) where P+, P–, G+, G–, u+, and u– are permeability, partial conductance, and mobility of cation and anion, respectively. Each mutant will have a certain Ψ′pore, that will be different depending on the residue that was substituted by the cysteine. Upon modification with MTSEA, however, there will be an additional potential generated by the new positive charge introduced at the cysteine, so that we can write Equation 6. (P+/P−)EA=(u+/u−)exp(−2(ψ'pore+ψ'EA))(Eq. 6) When the same mutant is modified with MTSES, instead, the additional potential will be generated by a negative charge as in Equation 7. (P+/P−)ES=(u+/u−)exp(−2(ψ'pore+ψ'ES))(Eq. 7) By combining Equations 6 and 7 we obtain Equation 8, (P+/P−)ES/(P+/P−)EA=exp(2(ψ'EA−ψ'ES))(Eq. 8) which is a quantity independent from the variable entrance potential of the unmodified mutant Ψ′pore. For the potential generated by a fixed charge in solution, at a distance R, we can take the Debye-Hückel expression (23Bockris J.O.M. Reddy A.K.N. Modern electrochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1970Google Scholar) in Equation 9, ψ=(Q/4πεε0)exp(−κR)/R(Eq. 9) where κ is the Debye-Hückel coefficient, Q is the fixed charge in elementary units, ϵ and ϵo the dielectric constants of water (relative) and vacuum (absolute). Because the two modifications carry one, opposite, elementary charge we can write Equation 10. (ψEA−ψES)=(e/2πεε0)exp(−κR)/R(Eq. 10) Finally, if we combine equations 8 and 10, and we take into account that the pore is formed by a tetrameric aggregate of α-helices, which we assume to be symmetrically distributed in their contribution to the field, we can write Equation 11. (P+/P−)ES/(P+/P−)EA=exp((4e2/kTπεε0)exp(−κR)/R)(Eq. 11) To calculate the distance R of the introduced charge from z, the central axis of the pore, we have to take into account its location around the α-helix and its position along the α-helix. In fact, if the helix forms an angle θ with the normal to the membrane (assumed to be parallel to the pore axis), the pore would have a funnel shape, as shown in Fig. 2. If Asp-10 is the first residue of the α-helix, located at the narrowest point of the pore, then R is given by Equation 12, R=r+d sinθ+a(1−cosα)cosθ(Eq. 12) where d = nδ (n is the position of the successive residues along the α-helix with respect to Asp-10 and δ is the pitch of the α-helix, i.e. 0.15 nm per residue), a is the radius of the α-helix (taken as 0.5 nm), α is the angular position of the n residue in the plane perpendicular to the helix axis (α = 2πn/3.6), and r is the radius of the pore at the narrowest position, where Asp-10 is located (n = 0). If we substitute Equation 12 into Equation 11, and we give to the constants their corresponding values, we obtain an expression for (P+/P–)ES/(P+/P–)EA versus n with only two free parameters, r and θ as shown in Equations 13 and 14. (P+/P−)ES/(P+/P−)EA=exp(12exp(−1.1R)/R)(Eq. 13) R=r+0.15nsinθ+0.5(1−cos1.7n)cosθ(Eq. 14) This expression was used to fit the experimental results in Fig. 8. Experimental Design—Pore formation by actinoporins is a multistep process that leads from the monomeric state in solution to a membrane-inserted aggregate composed of three or four monomers (Fig. 1C). This process includes at least three conformationally different membrane-bound states: an initial complex stabilized by the aromatic cluster (M1-state), a monomer-membrane complex with the N terminus inserted into the lipid-water interface (M2-state) (11Hong Q. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41916-41924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and a final functional oligomeric complex (P-state). Calcein release experiments have indicated that the number of pores formed in a single vesicle depends strongly on the L/T lipid to toxin ratio (13Belmonte G. Pederzolli C. Maček P. Menestrina G. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 131: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, even at very high toxin densities (low L/T) the proportion of pores formed was still very low in comparison to the amount of bound monomeric toxin (14Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, not reasonable to study the topology of the N-terminal helix in the oligomeric pore by fluorescence techniques, as there will be always a contribution from the monomeric forms also present. For this reason, we decided to study by fluorescence only the topology of the N-terminal region 10–28 of the monomeric membrane-bound toxin. We used high L/T ratios, in order to obtain homogeneous population of the M2-state. At the conditions chosen for all subsequent experiments (SUV DPPC/SM 1:1; 250 nm EqtII; L/T molar ratio 1000) the release of calcein was only 0.4% ± 0.2 (n = 2 ± S.D.), indicating that the amount of functional pores (P-state) was negligible. There was no residual hemolytic activity in the sample after the calcein release experiment; therefore, EqtII was fully bound to the membranes (10Malovrh P. Barlič A. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Menestrina G. Anderluh G. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). According to the reported equilibrium constants for lipid-bound monomeric states (11Hong Q. Gutierrez-Aguirre I. Barlič A. Malovrh P. Kristan K. Podlesek Z. Maček P. Turk D. González-Mañas J.M. Lakey J.H. Anderluh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41916-41924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and oligomeric P-state (14Tejuca M. Dalla Serra M. Ferreras M. Lanio M.E. Menestrina G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14947-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) we can reasonably assume prevalence of the M2-state (about 92% of the total EqtII) over all other toxin forms. PLM experiments were employed to study the topology of the N-terminal region in the final oligomeric pore conformation, since this technique is only sensitive to ion flow through open pores. Any change in ion selectivity observed through the channels should therefore be the result of the side chain alterations introduced by cysteine mutagenesis and by subsequent chemical modifications of the thiol groups. Production and IANBD Labeling of Cysteine Mutants—Cysteine mutants were prepared by using an E. coli expression system. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was measured in order to check for any conformational changes induced by the mutation. The value of the tryptophan emission maxima (λmax) for all mutants was 339 ± 1 nm, similar to that of the WT; hence we assumed that the conformation of mutants remained unaltered. Mutants were further assayed for hemolytic activity and binding to bovine red blood cells. The majority of the mutants retained >50% of the WT activity. A12C, L26C, G27C, and N28C were exceptions having only 16, 15, 17, and 0.7% of the WT activity, respectively. The reason for the decreased activity of N28C may be a lower conformational stability. As this mutant could be produced only in extremely small amounts and also precipitated over time it was not used in fluorescence studies. The lower activity of A12C and G27C was not due to low binding to the bovine erythrocytes membranes, as they bound fully, but obviously later steps in pore formation were inhibited. Of all mutants only L26C exhibited reduced binding, which resulted in reduced hemolytic activity. However, this mutant bound fully to SUV under the conditions employed for fluorescence studies. Mutants were labeled with a thiol-specific probe IANBD. G11C, S15C, and F16C were not used in fluorescence experiments due to insufficient expression levels in bacteria. No reaction between IANBD and WT was detected. The extent of labeling was mutant-dependent and ranged from 10% for L26C to 100% for I18C. L19C could not be labeled. The side chain of Leu-19 is oriented from the hydrophobic face of the helix toward the β-sandwich ensuring that it is completely buried and thus inaccessible to IANBD. Most of the labeled mutants were slightly less hemolytically active; however, the majority retained more than 50% of the hemolytic activity"

Here we report a novel mechanism by which sustained ERK1/2 activation is established. We demonstrate that Pb(II), a carcinogenic metal, persistently induces ERK1/2 activity in CL3 human lung cancer cells and that Ras-Raf-MKK1/2 signaling cannot fully account for such activation. It is intriguing that Pb(II) treatment reduces mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1) protein levels in time- and dose-dependent manners, which correlates with sustained ERK1/2 activation, and that Pb(II) also induces mRNA and de novo protein synthesis of MKP-1. In Pb(II)-treated cells, MKP-1 is polyubiquitinated, and proteasome inhibitors markedly alleviate the ubiquitination and degradation of MKP-1.

Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). MAPKs are activated through a three-kinase module composed of a MAPK, a MAPK kinase (MKK), and a MKK kinase (MKKK). These MAPK modules are connected to cell surface receptors and activated via interaction with a family of small GTPases and MKKK kinases. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate many substrates, including cytoskeletal proteins, other kinases, phosphatases, enzymes, and transcription factors, thereby orchestrating several cellular alterations including proliferation, differentiation, survival, and apoptosis. The duration and strength of MAPK activation also affects these biological outcomes. Three major MAPK subfamilies have been extensively studied, i.e. the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs), and the p38 kinases. Activation of a particular MAPK signal must be controlled with high specificity and efficiency to achieve precise physiological regulation. The recent discovery of specific docking sites among the members of the MAPK cascades provide a mechanism that explains how specific and efficient signaling is established. For instance, a cluster of positively charged amino acids followed by an LXL motif called the D domain (or the kinase interaction motif, KIM) has been identified in MKKs, MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), and several MAPK substrates (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 7Tanoue T. Nishida E. Pharmacol.

The D domain binds specifically to an acidic domain (common docking domain) within a docking groove of MAPKs (6Tanoue T. Adachi M. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Nat.

Another docking site found in many ERK substrates is called the DEF motif (docking site for ERK, FXFP) (8Sharrocks A.D. Yang S.H. Galanis A. Trends Biochem.

These docking interactions facilitate phosphorylation of substrates by MAPKs on specific Ser or Thr residues followed by a Pro residue ((S/T)P sites). The small GTPase, MKKK, and MKK in the ERK pathway are known to be Ras, Raf, and MKK1/2, respectively (1Chang L. Karin M.

Activation of ERK1/2 requires a dual-phosphorylation by MKK1/2 on the Thr and Tyr residues of TEY sites within the activation loop, whereas dephosphorylation of these residues by MKPs terminates such activation (10Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 11Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M.

Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 182-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Among these MKPs, MKP-1, MKP-2, and MKP-3 are prototypes whose functional associations with MAPK signals have been well characterized in several aspects. The MKP-3 is localized predominantly in the cytosol, whereas the MKP-1 and MKP-2 are localized primarily in the nuclear compartment. mkp-1 and mkp-2 are immediate early genes rapidly induced by many of the stimuli that activate MAPKs, whereas mkp-3 is not an immediate early gene. The phosphatase activity of MKPs is markedly elevated by specific interaction with MAPKs. For example, the association of ERK2 with MKP-3 is highly specific, and the complex formation results in a dramatic enhancement of MKP-3 phosphatase activity to down-regulate ERK2 activity in the cytosol (14Camps M. Nichols A. Gillieron C. Antonsson B. Muda M. Chabert C. Boschert U. Arkinstall S. Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). MKP-1 selectively associates with ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38α, which results in the catalytic activation of MKP-1 and the subsequent inactivation of MAPKs in the nucleus (15Slack D.N. Seternes O.M. Gabrielsen M. Keyse S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16491-16500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Similarly, the catalytic activity of MKP-2 is greatly elevated upon binding with ERK1/2 and JNK1 (16Chen P. Hutter D. Yang X. Gorospe M. Davis R.J. Liu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29440-29449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that MKPs feedback inhibit their activating MAPKs precisely. On the other hand, MKP-1 has been reported to be a labile protein whose stabilization can be enhanced by proteasome inhibitors or glucocorticoids (17Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R.

Furthermore, ERK1/2 is required for the phosphorylation of MKP-1 on the two extreme C-terminal Ser residues, which enhances MKP-1 stabilization without affecting its phosphatase activity (17Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). This suggests that ERK1/2 may negatively control its own activity by triggering the stabilization of MKP-1. Sustained ERK1/2 activity is strongly associated with many types of cancers occurring in pancreas, colon, lung, ovary, prostate, and kidney. This may be attributable to elevated Ras-Raf-MKK1/2 signaling (20Hoshino R. Chatani Y. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Oka H. Yoshida O. Shimada Y. Ari-i S. Wada H. Fujimoto J. Kohno M.

We recently reported that Pb(II) persistently stimulates ERK1/2 without activating JNK, p38, and ERK5 in CL3 human lung cancer cells and normal human fibroblasts, and sustained ERK1/2 signaling is essential for cellular nucleotide excision repair synthesis, anti-cytotoxicity, and anti-mutagenesis (25Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.-M. Yang J.-L. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate the roles of activators and regulators in controlling the duration and strength of ERK1/2 activation using Pb(II) as a stimulus. Our results show for the first time that ERK1/2 signaling can trigger MKP-1 degradation via the ubiquitinproteasome pathway, thereby accomplishing sustained kinase activation. We further demonstrate that Pb(II) triggers not only MKP-1 degradation but also MKP-1 expression at transcriptional and translational levels. The results presented here indicate that ERK1/2 is capable of performing dual and opposing roles in controlling its own activity through up- and down-regulation of MKP-1, thereby determining the duration and strength of kinase activation.

The antibodies specific against phospho-ERK1/2(Thr202/Tyr204) (catalog number 9101) and phospho-MKK1/2(Ser217/Ser221) (catalog number 9121) were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ERK2 (C-14 or K-23), MKK1 (12-B), MKP-1 (V-15), ubiquitin (P4D1), c-Fos (sc-52), and α-tubulin (TU-02) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The monoclonal antibody against Myc (MSA-110) was from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Cell Culture—The CL3 cell line established from a non-small cell lung carcinoma tumor and the Chinese hamster ovary cell line CHO-K1 was cultured in RPMI 1640 and F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete media, respectively. The human diploid fibroblast line HFW and the human embryonic kidney cell line H293 were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete media. The complete media were supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (2.2%, w/v), l-glutamine (0.03%, w/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fetal calf serum (10%). CL3 and CHO-K1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 in air, whereas H293 and HFW cells were cultured in a 10% CO2 incubator. Treatment—Cells in exponential growth were plated before serum starvation for 16–18 h. Serum-starved cells were then exposed to lead acetate for 15 min to 24 h in serum-free media. In experiments to determine the effect of de novo protein synthesis, cells were exposed to Pb(II) for 12 h, and cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) was added during the final 1–3 h. To determine the effect of MKK1/2 on MKP-1 and ERK1/2 levels, PD98059 (25 μm) was added 1 h before the addition of Pb(II) for 24 h. To determine the effect of proteasome-mediated proteolysis, ALLN (10 μm) and MG132 (25 μm) were added in the final 3 h during treatment of cells with Pb(II) for 24 h. Transfection—Cells (5 × 105) were plated in a 60-mm Petri dish 1 day before transfection. Plasmids were carried by liposome and transferred into CL3 cells using GenePORTER™2 (Gene Therapy Systems, San Diego, CA). After 24 and 48 h, the cells were exposed to Pb(II) for 24 h and 30 min in serum-free media, respectively. The cells were then subjected to whole cell extract preparation and a colony-forming ability assay. Colony-forming Ability Assay—Immediately after treatment, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and trypsinized for determination of cell numbers. The cells were plated at a density of 100–200 cells per 60-mm Petri dish in triplicate for each treatment. The cells were then cultured for 7–14 days, and cell colonies were stained with 1% crystal violet solution (in 30% ethanol). Western Blot Analysis—After treatment, cells were rinsed twice with cold PBS and lysed in a whole cell extract buffer (20 mm HEPES at pH 7.6, 75 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin and 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride). The cell lysate was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 15 min, after which the precipitates were discarded. The BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was employed to determine protein concentrations using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Equal amounts of proteins from each set of experiments were subjected to Western blot analysis as described (31Chuang S.-M. Wang I.-C. Yang J.-L. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were stripped from polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using a solution containing 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.7% (w/w) β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 15 min before re-probing with another primary antibody. Relative protein blot intensities were determined using a computing densitometer equipped with the ImageQuant analysis program (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—After treatment, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and harvested at 4 °C in an immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Equal amounts of proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-ERK2, anti-MKP-1, and anti-ubiquitin antibodies and collected with protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunoprecipitate was then washed three times in a cold lysis buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis and an ERK kinase assay. ERK Kinase Assay—The anti-ERK2 immunoprecipitate was washed in a kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF). The kinase assay was carried out in a total volume of 30 μl of a kinase reaction buffer containing 20 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and 0.5 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylated MBP was resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels followed by autoradiography. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA (30 μg), isolated via a guanidium isothiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction procedure, was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-2.2 m formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized to 32P-labeled DNA probes that were prepared using T4 kinase end-labeling. The synthetic human mkp-1 probe sequence used was 5′-AGGGGCGAGCAAAAAGAAACC-3′. Hybridization was performed at 42 °Cfor3hina solution containing 50% formamide, 6× SSC (1× SSC contains 180 mm NaCl and 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 8.0), 5× Denhardt's reagent, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Membranes were washed with 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 5 min at 42 °C for 5 min and then exposed to x-ray film. Ras-Raf-MKK1/2 Signaling Is More Important for the Early than the Persistent ERK1/2 Activation by Pb(II)—CL3 cells were exposed to lead acetate (30 μm) in serum free medium for 15 min to 24 h, and the activation of MKK1/2 and ERK1/2 was determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific to phospho-MKK1/2 and phospho-ERK1/2. Fig. 1A shows that Pb(II) increased the phospho-ERK1/2 protein levels in CL3 cells in a time-dependent manner, e.g. exposure for 15 min and 24 h yielded increases of 1.7- and 4.4-fold, respectively, over untreated controls. Pb(II) also increased phospho-MKK1/2 protein levels in CL3 cells with the maximum level of induced phospho-MKK1/2 (2.0-fold) observed at an exposure time of 15 min (Fig. 1A). Reprobing these blots with anti-ERK2 and anti-MKK1 antibodies showed similar endogenous ERK2 and MKK1 protein levels in each cell extract, respectively (Fig. 1A). These results indicate that Pb(II) elicits different kinetics for the activation of ERK1/2 and their upstream MKK1/2 signals. To investigate whether Pb(II) elicits MKK1/2-ERK1/2 activation via the Ras-Raf pathway, CL3 cells were transfected with plasmids containing dominant negative forms of Ras (RasN17) or Raf (Raf301). The cells were then allowed expression for 48 and 24 h before exposure to 100 μm Pb(II) for 30 min and 24 h, respectively. ERK in the whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with an anti-ERK2 antibody, and its kinase activity was determined using MBP as a substrate. As shown in Fig. 1B, the expression of RasN17 or Raf301 completely blocked the induction of ERK kinase activity in cells exposed to Pb(II) for 30 min. However, only partial suppression of the Pb(II)-elicited ERK kinase activity was observed when these RasN17- or Raf301-transfected cells were exposed to Pb(II) for 24 h (Fig. 1C). These results imply that Ras-Raf-MKK1/2 signaling is essential for early activation of ERK1/2 but cannot fully account for the persistent activation of ERK1/2 elicited by Pb(II). Persistent ERK1/2 Activation by Pb(II) Is Accompanied by Decreased MKP-1 Protein Levels—The activation of ERK1/2 kinase activity is mainly a kinetic control between their activating kinases and inactivating phosphatases. The dual specific phosphatase MKP-1 is known to down-regulate ERK2 activity in the nucleus (10Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 11Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar, 12Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin.

To determine whether constitutive activation of ERK1/2 by Pb(II) is associated with mechanisms involved in down-regulation of MKP-1, we examined MKP-1 protein levels in CL3 cells exposed to 100 μm Pb(II) for 1–24 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, MKP-1 protein levels were slightly elevated during Pb(II) exposure for 1–6 h, whereas MKP-1 levels substantially decreased after longer exposure times (12–24 h). This time-dependent increase and decrease in MKP-1 protein levels was also observed in HFW human diploid fibroblasts (data not shown). Exposing CL3 cells to various doses of Pb(II) for 24 h also led to down-regulation of MKP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). Moreover, the reduced MKP-1 levels had not recovered 8 h after removal of the Pb(II) (Fig. 2C). Fig. 2, B and C also show that lowered MKP-1 levels were accompanied by increased ERK1/2 activities under Pb(II) exposure. These results indicate that down-regulation of MKP-1 protein levels by Pb(II) is strongly associated with the persistent activation of ERK1/2. MKP-1 Lowering by Pb(II) Is Not Associated with Down-regulation of Its mRNA or de Novo Protein Synthesis—The long-term effect of Pb(II) in down-regulating MKP-1 suggests a decrease in mRNA expression/protein synthesis or protein stability. To assess whether Pb(II) affects the expression of mkp-1, mRNA was isolated and identified by Northern blotting. Fig. 3A shows that mkp-1 mRNA levels constantly increased during exposure to 100 μm Pb(II), indicating that reduced MKP-1 protein levels are not due to suppression at the transcriptional level. To explore whether Pb(II) exposure affects MKP-1 at the translational level, cycloheximide (10 μg/ml), an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis, was added for the final 3 h of cell exposure to Pb(II) (100 μm) for 12 h. Cycloheximide did not lower MKP-1 protein levels in untreated cells (Fig. 3B), indicating that the endogenous MKP-1 protein is rather stable. However, cycloheximide co-treatment further decreased MKP-1 levels in cells treated with Pb(II) (Fig. 3B), indicating that new synthesis of MKP-1 does occur with Pb(II) exposure. These results suggest that down-regulation of MKP-1 protein levels is not due to decreases in its mRNA or protein synthesis. MKP-1 Lowering by Pb(II) Is Mediated through Ubiquitin-directed Proteolysis—The 26 S proteasome machinery is known to be the major regulator of protein turnover in eukaryotic cells by which many labile proteins are targeted for degradation mediated through the covalent addition of polyubiquitin chains to lysine residues (32Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6959) Google Scholar, 33Kornitzer D. Ciechanover A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of proteasome in the Pb(II) lowering of MKP-1 proteins, ALLN, a common 26 S proteasome inhibitor, was added at a concentration of 10 μm for the final 3 h of the treatment of CL3 cells with 100 μm Pb(II) for 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4A, ALLN restored the Pb(II)-decreased MKP-1 proteins to their untreated level. MG132, another proteasome inhibitor, also prevented the degradation of the MKP-1 protein caused by Pb(II) treatment (Fig. 4A). To determine whether MKP-1 proteins are modified by ubiquitination before degradation, cells were co-exposed to Pb(II) and ALLN as described above, and the MKP-1 protein in whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated and then subjected to immunoblot analysis using an anti-ubiquitin antibody. As shown in Fig. 4B, the endogenous MKP-1 was recognized by the antibody against ubiquitin, indicating that MKP-1 was modified by ubiquitin. Similar results were observed in immunoblot analysis using an anti-MKP-1 antibody to detect ubiquitinated proteins derived from anti-ubiquitin immunoprecipitates in Pb(II)-exposed cells (Fig. 4B). Taken together, these results indicate that Pb(II) triggers MKP-1 protein degradation via the ubiquitin-directed 26 S proteasome pathway in CL3 cells. Ubiquitin-directed Proteolysis of MKP-1 Is Dependent on ERK1/2 Signaling—To determine whether Pb(II)-elicited ERK1/2 signaling is involved in controlling MKP-1 degradation, cells were pretreated with the MKK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (25 μm) for 1 h before exposure to 100 μm Pb(II) for 24 h. The whole cell extract was isolated for determination of MKP-1 levels by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5A, PD98059 completely blocked Pb(II)-elicited ERK1/2 activation. Interestingly, PD98059 co-treatment restored the MKP-1 protein lowered by Pb(II) to a level higher than that in untreated cells (Fig. 5A). Moreover, PD98059 prevented significant polyubiquitination of MKP-1 in Pb(II)-treated CL3 cells (Fig. 5B). The role of ERK1/2 signaling in triggering proteolysis of the MKP-1 protein was further examined by transient transfection of CL3 cells with a plasmid carrying MKK1-CA, a constitutively active form of MKK1. As shown in Fig. 6, the expression of MKK1-CA significantly increased MKP-1 ubiquitination and decreased the levels of this protein in CL3 cells. Ubiquitination of the endogenous MKP-1 protein by forced expression of MKK1-CA also occurred in H293 and CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6B), and forced expression of MKK2-CA also induced MKP-1 ubiquitination and degradation in CL3, H293, and CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 6B, and data not shown). These results indicate that activation of MKK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling that elicits MKP-1 protein ubiquitination and degradation may be a widespread phenomenon. Exogenous MKP-1 Phosphatase Activity Decreases ERK Phosphorylation and c-Fos Protein Level and Enhanced Cytotoxicity upon Pb(II) Exposure—To explore whether the phosphatase activity of MKP-1 is essential for dephosphorylation of ERK1/2 in CL3 cells, plasmids containing either wild-type MKP-1 or the catalytically inactive mutant MKP-1CS were transfected into cells, allowed expression for 24 h, and then exposed to 100 μm Pb(II) for another 24 h. As Fig. 7 shows, forced expression of wild-type MKP-1 decreased the phospho-ERK1/2 levels induced by Pb(II), whereas the MKP-1CS did not have such an effect. On the other hand, phospho-ERK1/2 levels in the untreated control cells were slightly reduced and enhanced by the expression of MKP-1 and MKP-1CS, respectively (Fig. 7). Conversely, the over-expression of either wild-type MKP-1 or MKP-1CS had no effect on MKK1/2 activation by Pb(II) (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that supplementing exogenous MKP-1 can dephosphorylate ERK1/2 in CL3 cells. In an earlier study we demonstrated that Pb(II)-elicited ERK1/2 activity is required for the induction of c-Fos protein levels and the prevention of cytotoxicity (25Lin Y.-W. Chuang S.-M. Yang J.-L. Carcinogenesis. 2003; 24: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To investigate whether exogenous expr"

Fetuin purified from the FMC contains 3.3 mol of protein-bound phosphate. There is 1.3 mg of FMC/ml of serum 6 h after etidronate injection, and the FMC is 46% fetuin and 53% mineral by mass. Formation of the FMC in the first 6 h after etidronate injection does not increase serum fetuin despite the fact that 50% of serum fetuin is associated with the FMC, and clearance of the FMC in the 9–24-h interval lowers total serum fetuin by 50%. These observations suggest that the fetuin component of the FMC is derived from fetuin initially in serum and that clearance of the FMC removes the associated fetuin from circulation. One additional protein was consistently present in all preparations of the FMC, spp24 (secreted phosphoprotein 24). This 24-kDa protein is similar in domain structure to fetuin and, like fetuin and MGP, contains several residues of phosphoserine and accumulates in bone.

The present experiments are a continuation of our investigations into the mechanisms by which proteins interact specifically with mineral in vivo to prevent the calcification of arteries and other soft tissues. In a previous study (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol.

The fetuin-mineral complex reaches maximal levels 6–9 h after etidronate injection and causes a 4-fold increase in total serum calcium without causing any increase in ionic calcium levels. The proteins associated with the fetuin-mineral complex, fetuin and matrix Gla protein (MGP), have both been shown to function as potent inhibitors of calcification in vitro. Fetuin is a 59-kDa protein that consists of two N-terminal cystatin domains and a smaller C-terminal domain. Fetuin is synthesized by the liver and secreted into blood, where it is found at a concentration of ∼1 mg/ml in the rat (2Kazi J.A. Nakamura O. Ohnishi T. Arakaki N. Kajihara T. Nakagawa S.

Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10828-10832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical studies have convincingly demonstrated that impaired MGP function causes extensive calcification of the elastic lamellae in the artery media of mice (13Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar), rats (14Price P.A. Faus S.A. Williamson M.K. Arterioscler. Thromb.

Genet. 1999; 21: 142-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that the calcification inhibitory properties of fetuin and MGP may be related to their ability to form complexes with nascent mineral nuclei that prevent the growth of the mineral and target it for clearance from blood. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that formation of the fetuin mineral complex prevents the growth, aggregation, and precipitation of the mineral component (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and by the observation that the fetuin-mineral complex is removed from blood in the 9–24-h interval following etidronate injection (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The objectives of the present investigations were to better characterize the composition of the fetuin-mineral complex, to identify additional protein components in the complex, and to determine the impact of the generation and clearance of the complex on total serum levels of fetuin. In the course of these studies we have developed the first method for isolating the native, phosphorylated form of fetuin from rat serum and the first immunoassay for the determination of rat fetuin in serum and in other biological specimens. Materials—Albino male rats (Sprague-Dawley-derived) were purchased from Simonsen labs (Gilroy, CA). Etidronate was a gift from Proctor & Gamble (Cincinnati, OH). Sephacryl S300HR gel filtration media was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Warfarin and human serum amyloid P component were purchased from Sigma, and human platelet factor 4 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). NuPAGE Bis-Tris 4–12% polyacrylamide gradient gels were purchased from Invitrogen. MGP and spp24 (secreted phosphoprotein 24) were purified from bovine bone as described (16Hale J.E. Fraser J.D. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5820-5824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hu B. Coulson L. Moyer B. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 431-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). All other reagents used were reagent grade or better. Purification of Rat Fetuin—In a typical experiment, six 40-day-old male rats were exsanguinated 6 h after receiving a subcutaneous injection of 32 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight. The blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature, and the serum was collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min, pooled, and frozen in sixteen 1-ml aliquots at –70 °C until use. The 1-ml aliquots were centrifuged for 2 h at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were then removed, and the pellets were rinsed briefly with 1 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl, resuspended in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer (20 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.02% azide, and 0.15 m NaCl) and centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g. After removal of the supernatants, the pellets were dissolved serially in a 1-ml volume of 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and applied directly to a 2 × 140 cm column of Sephacryl S300HR equilibrated with 5 mm NH4HCO3 at room temperature. Fractions of 3 ml were collected, and the absorbance at 220 nm was determined; fetuin protein concentrations were estimated based on the assumption that a 1 mg/ml solution of fetuin has an absorbance of 10 at 220 nm. The ratio of absorbance at 220 nm to absorbance at 280 nm for purified rat fetuin is 32.4. Fetuin-containing fractions were either used directly or concentrated to dryness by speed vacuum and then resuspended in the desired volume of buffer. Analytical Methods—For determination of MGP, the samples were assayed in triplicate using radioimmunoassay procedures previously described (12Otawara Y. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10828-10832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Luo G. Ducy P. McKee M.D. Pinero G.J. Loyer E. Behringer R.R. Karsenty G. Nature. 1997; 386: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). Calcium levels in serum and other samples were determined colorimetrically using cresolphthalein complexone (Sigma), and phosphate levels in serum and other samples were determined colorimetrically as described (18Chen P.S. Toribara T.Y. Warner H. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1756-1758Crossref Scopus (5827) Google Scholar). Protein sequencing was carried out on bands transferred to PVDF membranes using a Procise 494 Sequencer (ABI division, PE Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The phosphorylation of fetuin samples was determined using a modification of the Malachite Green procedure. In a typical experiment, 60 μg of protein in 150 μl of water was combined with 20 μl of 8 m NaOH and hydrolyzed for 30 min at 100 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 10 m HCl. 50-μl aliquots of the hydrolysate or of phosphate standards in 1.5 m HCl were placed in wells of a 96-well microtiter plate, and 100 μl of Malachite Green reagent (Biomed Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA) was added to each well and allowed to react for 90 min at room temperature. The results were obtained by measurement of absorbance at 600 nm. The number of mol of fetuin in a sample was calculated from the absorbance at 220 nm using the assumptions that the protein portion of fetuin has a molecular mass of 36,000 and that the protein mass can be estimated from the relation that a 1 mg/ml solution of fetuin has an absorbance of 10 at 220 nm. Radioimmunoassay for Rat Fetuin—Rabbits were immunized against purified rat fetuin by Strategic Biosolutions (Newark, DE), and the antiserum was used at a final 1:8000 dilution. The radioimmunoassay diluent, sample volumes, and procedures were identical to those used in the MGP radioimmunoassay (12Otawara Y. Price P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10828-10832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that the iodinated fetuin and the sample (serum or extract) were added to antibody at the same time. Fetuin was iodinated by incubating 10 μg of purified rat fetuin with 0.5 mCi of 125I and 4 μg of iodogen (Pierce) in 150 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 1h at room temperature. Maintenance of Animals—The rats were fed rodent diet 5001 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO), a diet that is 0.67% phosphorus and 0.95% calcium by mass. Etidronate was dissolved in water, titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH, and administered subcutaneously to 40-day-old male rats at a dose of 8 or 32 mg/100 g of body weight. To determine the effect of warfarin on the generation of the serum protein-mineral complex, the rats received subcutaneous injections of 15.4 mg of warfarin/100 g of body weight 2 h prior to etidronate injection. For plasma analyses, blood was drawn into a heparin-containing syringe to achieve a final heparin concentration of 75 μg/ml, and plasma was collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min in a clinical centrifuge. For serum, the blood was allowed to clot for 30 min at room temperature, and the serum was collected by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 10 min. The University of California, San Diego Animal Subjects Committee approved all animal experiments. Biochemical Characterization of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex—To determine the composition of the fetuin-mineral complex at the 32 mg/100 g of body weight dose of etidronate, eight rats received etidronate at t = 0. Four of these rats were exsanguinated 6 h later, and four rats were exsanguinated 24 h later. Three 200-μl aliquots of pooled serum obtained at the two time points were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 h to sediment the fetuin-mineral complex. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were washed briefly with 200 μl of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and then dissolved overnight in 100 μl of 0.15 m HCl. Each solution was analyzed for calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP; the numbers shown in Fig. 4 and Table II are the averages of the three individual determinations on each serum pool.Table IIComposition of the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of etidronate-treated ratsEtidronate doseComposition of fetuin-mineral complexCalciumPhosphateFetuinMGPmgμgμgμgμg32314 ± 8357 ± 41578 ± 206.3 ± 1.1875 ± 697 ± 10283 ± 307.2 ± 0.6 Open table in a new tab To determine the composition of the fetuin-mineral complex at the 8 mg/100 g of body weight dose of etidronate, four rats received etidronate at t = 0 and were exsanguinated 6 h later. To sediment the fetuin-mineral complex, three 175-μl aliquots of pooled serum were placed in polyallomer centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for1hina Beckman Airfuge operated at 27 p.s.i. (∼164,000 × g). After the removal of the supernatants, the pellets were washed briefly with 175 μl of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and then dissolved overnight in 70 μl of 0.15 m HCl. Each solution was analyzed for calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP; the numbers shown in Table II are the averages of the three individual determinations. Identification of Additional Constituents of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex—To identify additional proteins in the fetuin-mineral complex, the rats were exsanguinated 6 h after etidronate injection. For the samples from animals treated with 32 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight, 1-ml aliquots of pooled serum or plasma were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 2 h to sediment the fetuin-mineral complex. After removal of the supernatant, the pellets were washed briefly with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and resuspended in 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer. The aliquots were again centrifuged for 30 min at 16,000 × g, and the supernatants were removed. For samples from animals treated with 8 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight, 175-μl aliquots of pooled serum or plasma were centrifuged at 164,000 × g for 1 h to sediment the fetuin-mineral complex. After removal of the supernatants, the pellets were washed briefly with 175 μl of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl and then resuspended in 40 μl of HEPES buffer. The aliquots were again centrifuged for 1 h at 164,000 × g, and the supernatants were removed. The final pellets from the 8- and 32-mg doses were dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and electrophoresed on 4–12% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were either stained with Coomassie or electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane for N-terminal protein sequencing. Studies were also carried out to see whether the addition of purified MGP, platelet factor 4, secreted phosphoprotein 24, or serum amyloid P component to serum from etidronate-treated rats would increase the level of each in the fetuin-mineral complex. In a typical experiment, serum was obtained from rats 6 h after injection of 32 mg of etidronate/100 g, and 200 μl of this serum was placed into each of three tubes. One tube received 5 μg of purified platelet factor 4, the second received no addition, and the third received 5 μg of platelet factor 4 and 50 mm EDTA. Each tube was centrifuged for 2 h at 16,000 × g. The supernatants were then removed, and the tubes were rinsed briefly with 200 μl of ice-cold 0.15 m NaCl. The three pellets were then dissolved in SDS gel loading buffer containing 60 mm EDTA, and 50% of the dissolved pellet was electrophoresed on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel; the control lane contained 2.5 μg of platelet factor 4 alone. This procedure was repeated to test the possible incorporation of 20 μg of secreted phosphoprotein 24 and 6 μg of purified human serum amyloid P component into the fetuin-mineral complex. For MGP, 100 μg of the protein was added to 200 μl of serum, and only 10% of the dissolved pellet was loaded onto the gel. Purification of Fetuin from the Serum of Etidronate-treated Rats—The native form of rat fetuin was purified from the serum fetuin-mineral complex for use in immunizations and immunoassays. The first step in purification was sedimentation of the fetuin-mineral complex by centrifugation of serum from etidronate-treated rats. In agreement with previous studies (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the resulting pellets were primarily fetuin with significant contamination by serum albumin (Fig. 1). To remove albumin and other nonspecifically associated contaminants, the pellets were resuspended in HEPES buffer, and the fetuin-mineral complex was again sedimented by centrifugation. As seen in lane 3 of Fig. 1, this stratagem removed most of the albumin contaminant with good recovery of fetuin. The final pellets were dissolved in 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and fractionated by gel filtration over Sephacryl S300HR. As shown in Fig. 2, the major protein component recovered from this purification step has an apparent molecular mass of 59 kDa, which is the same molecular mass previously found for rat fetuin. N-terminal sequence analysis of the pooled peak fractions 87–90 revealed the sequence APQGAGLGFR, which matches the N-terminal sequence of rat fetuin (19Ohnishi T. Nakamura O. Ozawa M. Arakaki N. Muramatsu T. Daikuhara Y. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1993; 8: 367-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These four peak fractions contain ∼6mg of rat fetuin, which is 65% of the fetuin estimated to be present in the fetuin-mineral complex in the initial 16-ml serum sample. As can be seen in Table I, rat fetuin purified by these procedures has an average phosphorylation of 3.3 mol P/mol, which is close to the number of potential sites of serine phosphorylation by the secretory pathway protein kinase (20Meggio F. Boulton A.P. Marchiori F. Forin G. Lennon D.P.W. Calderan A. Pinna L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In contrast, commercial samples of fetuin purified from fetal bovine serum and human serum had only 0.7 and 0.9 mol P/mol, respectively.Fig. 2Purification of rat fetuin by Sephacryl S300HR filtration of the EDTA-treated fetuin-mineral complex. 16 ml of serum was obtained from rats 6 h after injection with 32 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight. The fetuin-mineral complex was sedimented by centrifuging 1-ml aliquots of this serum for 2 h at 16,000 × g, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in HEPES buffer and recentrifuged. The final pellets were dissolved in 60 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and purified over a 2 × 140-cm column of Sephacryl S300HR equilibrated with 5 mm NH4HC03 at room temperature. Fraction size was 3 ml.

Open table in a new tab Biochemical Characterization of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex—A specific radioimmunoassay was developed for the quantitative detection of rat fetuin using protein purified by the above procedures for immunoassay standards and for raising antibodies in rabbits. As shown in Fig. 3, the fetuin radioimmunoassay detects fetuin amounts ranging from 5 to 100 ng, and the dose-dilution curve for rat serum parallels the curve for the purified rat fetuin standard. The fetuin radioimmunoassay was used to determine the composition of the fetuin-mineral complex found in rat serum at two different etidronate doses. The complex found in serum at 6 h after treatment with the 32 mg of etidronate/100 g dose can be sedimented by centrifugation for 2 h at 16,000 × g, and Table II gives the amounts of calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP found in the resulting pellet fraction. Assuming that the mass of the complex can be approximated by the sum of the calcium, phosphate, and fetuin masss, each 1 ml of serum from rats treated with the 32-mg dose of etidronate contains 1.3 mg of the complex, and the complex is 46% fetuin and 53% mineral by mass. The fetuin-mineral complex found in serum at 6 h after treatment with the lower, 8 mg of etidronate/100 g dose cannot be sedimented by centrifugation for 2 h at 16,000 × g (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and experiments were accordingly carried out to determine whether higher speed centrifugation would sediment the complex found in serum at the 8-mg dose. These experiments showed that centrifugation for 1 h at 164,000 × g sedimented the complex found in serum at the 8-mg dose and that the resulting pellet had the same translucent appearance as the pellet formed at the 32-mg dose. Table II gives the amounts of calcium, phosphate, fetuin, and MGP found in this pellet fraction. Assuming that the mass of the complex can be approximated by the sum of the calcium, phosphate, and fetuin masss, each 1 ml of serum from rats treated with the 8-mg dose of etidronate contains 0.46 mg of the complex, and the complex is 62% fetuin and 37% mineral by mass. Changes in Total Serum Fetuin Levels Associated with the Formation and Clearance of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex—The radioimmunoassay for rat fetuin was also used to determine the time course of formation and clearance of the fetuin-mineral complex from the serum of rats treated with 32 mg of etidronate/100 g of body weight. In agreement with previous studies (1Price P.A. Thomas G.T. Pardini A.W. Figueira W.F. Caputo J. Williamson M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3926-3934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), total serum calcium increased 4-fold over the first 9 h following etidronate injection and then fell to control levels between 9 and 24h (Fig. 4A); changes in serum phosphate paralleled the changes in serum calcium (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 4B, centrifugation of these serum samples showed that the changes in total serum calcium are due to the appearance and subsequent clearance of the fetuin-mineral complex from serum. Total serum fetuin levels were not significantly changed over the first 6 h following etidronate injection (Fig. 4A), despite the fact that almost half of the circulating fetuin becomes associated with the complex by the 6-h time point (Fig. 4B); this result shows that the fetuin associated with the serum mineral complex arises from the fetuin in circulation prior to etidronate injection. Fig. 4A also shows that total serum fetuin levels fall by ∼40% in the 6–24-h interval after etidronate injection, and Fig. 4B shows that this reduction in total serum fetuin is associated with the disappearance of the fetuin-mineral complex from serum in the 6–24-h interval. Identification of Additional Constituents of the Fetuin-Mineral Complex—Experiments were carried out to assess the possible presence of additional protein components in the fetuin-mineral complex. To ensure that only those proteins that are actually associated with the fetuin-mineral complex were identified, the initial pellets formed upon centrifugation of serum from etidronate-treated rats were resuspended in buffer and repelleted prior to analysis (cf.Fig. 1). Fig. 5A shows the Coommassie staining pattern obtained when SDS gels were overloaded with the fetuin-mineral complex found in rats treated with the 32-mg dose of etidronate. To identify protein components, the gel electrophoresis step was repeated, and the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The proteins identified by N-terminal sequencing of bands cut from this membrane are shown in Fig. 5A. In addition to the dominant fetuin component, four additional components were consistently seen in the SDS gels carried out on pellet fractions from rats treated with the 32-mg etidronate dose: matrix Gla protein, secreted phosphoprotein 24, serum amyloid P component, and prothrombin. Platelet factor 4 was also consistently present in SDS gels carried out on pellets formed by centrifugation of serum from different rats but was not seen in pellets formed by centrifugation of heparin plasma from the same animals, which is consistent with the fact that plasma levels of the protein are ∼1000 times lower than serum levels (21Brandt E. Petersen F. Ludwig A. Ehlert J.E. Bock L. Flad H.-D. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2000; 67: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hemoglobin was detected in some pellets but not others; the samples that contained hemoglobin consistently had a small red component at the bottom of the pellet, which suggests that these samples may have had some erythrocyte contamination. The addition of EDTA to serum prior to centrifugation eliminated all bands associated with the fetuin-mineral complex (data not shown). Fig. 5B shows the results obtained when SDS gels were overloaded with the fetuin-mineral complex found in the serum of rats treated with the 8-mg dose of etidronate. As seen, the pattern is markedly similar to the pattern with the 32-mg etidronate dose, with comparable bands of matrix Gla protein, platelet factor 4, and secreted phosphoprotein 24. Hemoglobin was present in some but not all of the serum samples, and its presence again correlated with the presence of a small red component at the bottom of the pellet. The major difference between the composition of the pellets formed by centrifugation of serum from rats treated with the 8- and 32-mg etidronate doses was the presence of serum amyloid P component at the 32-mg dose but not at the 8-mg dose.

It is generally thought that elephants do not run1,2,3,4,5, but there is confusion about how fast they can move across open terrain and what gait they use at top speed. Here we use video analysis to show that Asian elephants (Elephas maximus L.) can move at surprisingly high speeds of up to 6.8 m s−1 (25 km h−1) and that, although their gait might seem to be a walk even at this speed, some features of their locomotion conform to definitions of running."
https://openalex.org/W2107029930,"Notch3 is a transmembrane receptor and a member of the Notch signaling pathway essential for cellular differentiation in a variety of developing tissues in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Emerging data support the role of the Notch signaling pathway in tumorigenesis. We have previously demonstrated the expression of Notch3 in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. To further elucidate the role of Notch3 in development of lung cancer, we established a transgenic mouse model in which the intracellular domain of Notch3 is expressed using the surfactant protein C promoter/enhancer. Constitutive expression of Notch3 in the peripheral epithelium in the developing lung resulted in altered lung morphology and delayed development, leading to perinatal lethality in these transgenic mice. Cell-specific markers and electron microscopy examination showed that the majority of the epithelial cells are undifferentiated, with some maturation of type II pneumocytes. No type I alveolar cells were evident. Metaplasia of undifferentiated cells in the terminal airways was also observed. Although the mice did not live long enough to assess tumor development, these findings demonstrate that ectopic expression of Notch3 in airway epithelium potentially contributes to the multistep evolution of lung cancer through the inhibition of terminal differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2044887709,"Many human cancers occur in renewing epithelial tissues, in which cellular lineages typically go through two distinct phases: early in life, cell populations expand exponentially to form the tissue, and for the remainder of life, the tissue is renewed by stem cells dividing to create an almost linear cellular history1. Here we use a simple mathematical model to show that mutations that arise during the exponential phase probably seed tissues with stem cells carrying mutations that may predispose to cancer. Susceptibility to late-life cancers, such as those of the skin and colon, may therefore be influenced by somatic mutations that occur during early development."
https://openalex.org/W2084017714,"The protein kinase D (PKD) family consists of three serine/threonine kinases: PKCμ/PKD, PKD2, and PKCν/PKD3. Whereas PKD has been the focus of most studies, virtually nothing is known about the effect of G protein-coupled receptor agonists (GPCR) on the regulatory properties and intracellular distribution of PKD3. Consequently, we examined the mechanism that mediates its activation and intracellular distribution. GPCR agonists induced a rapid activation of PKD3 by a protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent pathway that leads to the phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKD3. Comparison of the steady-state distribution of endogenous or tagged PKD3 versus PKD and PKD2 in unstimulated cells indicated that whereas PKD and PKD2 are predominantly cytoplasmic, PKD3 is present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm. This distribution of PKD3 results from its continuous shuttling between both compartments by a mechanism that requires a nuclear import receptor and a competent CRM1-nuclear export pathway. Cell stimulation with the GPCR agonist neurotensin induced a rapid and reversible plasma membrane translocation of PKD3 that is PKC-dependent. Interestingly, the nuclear accumulation of PKD3 can be dramatically enhanced in response to its activation. Thus, this study demonstrates that the intracellular distribution of PKD isoenzymes are distinct, and suggests that their signaling properties are regulated by differential localization.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Google Scholar, 3Dekker L.V. Parker P.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 73-77Google Scholar, 4Hug H. Sarre T.F. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 329-343Google Scholar), which can be classified into three distinct subgroups on the basis of structural and regulatory differences: the conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ), which are regulated by calcium, DAG, and phospholipids; the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, η, and θ), which are regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and phospholipids; and the atypical PKCs (ζ and λ), whose regulation is less characterized, but that have been proposed to be regulated by D-3 phosphoinositides (6Toker A. Front. Biosci. 1998; 3: D1134-D1147Google Scholar). The DAG-regulated PKC isoforms all bind phorbol esters and are major cellular targets for this class of tumor promoter (7Nishizuka Y. Cancer. 1989; 63: 1892-1903Google Scholar). It is increasingly recognized that each isoform has specific functions in vivo (8Teruel M.N. Meyer T. Cell. 2000; 103: 181-184Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which PKC-mediated signals in the plasma membrane are propagated to critical downstream targets remain largely undefined. Protein kinase D (PKD)/protein kinase Cμ (9Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar, 10Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar) and two recently identified serine protein kinases termed PKD2 and PKCν/PKD3, which are similar in overall structure and primary amino acid sequence to PKD (11Hayashi A.

Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Google Scholar), constitute a new protein kinase subfamily separate from the previously identified PKCs. The salient features of the PKD structure include the presence of a catalytic domain distantly related to Ca2+-regulated kinases, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that regulates PKD activity, and a highly hydrophobic stretch of amino acids in its NH2-terminal region (9Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8572-8576Google Scholar, 10Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 19-23Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal region of PKD contains in addition to the PH domain, a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) that confers high affinity binding to phorbol esters and DAG (9Valverde A.M. Sinnett-Smith J.

Neuropeptides such as neurotensin (NT) and mammalian bombesin-like peptides act as potent cellular mitogens for a variety of cell types (17Rozengurt E.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1632-1640Google Scholar). Neuropeptides bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) that promote Gαq-mediated activation of β isoforms of phospholipase C (23Exton J.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 481-509Google Scholar) to produce two second messengers: inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate that mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores and DAG that activates PKC (24Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Google Scholar, 25Mikoshiba K. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 339-345Google Scholar). PKD can be activated in intact cells by tumor promoting phorbol esters, GPCR agonists, growth factors, and antigen-receptor engagement (26Abedi H. Rozengurt E. Zachary I.

PKD has been localized in the cytosol and in several intracellular compartments including Golgi, plasma membrane, and mitochondria (29Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Google Scholar). PKD has been implicated in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions, including DNA synthesis and cell proliferation (42Zhukova E. Sinnett-Smith J. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40298-40305Google Scholar), Golgi organization and function (43Liljedahl M. Maeda Y. Colanzi A. Ayala I. Van Lint J. Malhotra V.

Much less information is available on the regulation, biological roles, and intracellular distribution of other members of the PKD family. PKD2 can be activated by phorbol esters and the GPCR agonist gastrin (12Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Google Scholar, 50Sturany S. Van Lint J. Gilchrist A. Vandenheede J.R. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29431-29436Google Scholar) but the precise mechanism mediating its activation is still under investigation (50Sturany S. Van Lint J. Gilchrist A. Vandenheede J.R. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29431-29436Google Scholar). As for its intracellular distribution, we recently showed that PKD2 is present only in the cytosol of unstimulated or NT-stimulated cells (51Rey O. Yuan J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 817-824Google Scholar). Regarding PKD3, virtually nothing is known about its regulatory properties or intracellular distribution in response to GPCR agonists, although its cDNA sequence obtained from expressed sequence tag deduction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends was published before the cloning of PKD2 (11Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar). The experiments presented in this paper were designed to examine the mechanisms regulating the intracellular distribution and catalytic activity of PKD3. In striking contrast to the predominantly cytoplasmic localization of PKD and PKD2 shown in our previous studies, we demonstrate here that PKD3 is present both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of non-stimulated cell. Several lines of evidence, including studies using fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP), indicate that PKD3 continuously shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by a mechanism that requires a nuclear import receptor and a competent CRM1-nuclear export pathway. Our results also show that GPCR agonists induce a striking translocation of PKD3 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane that leads to its catalytic activation and rapid plasma membrane dissociation through PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKD3 (Ser731 and Ser735). Although PKD and PKD3 can be activated by PKCη, we found that only PKD forms a stable molecular complex with this novel PKC isoform. Upon its activation, PKD3 rapidly dissociates from the plasma membrane, moves into the cytosol, and is subsequently imported into the nucleus at a faster rate than in non-stimulate cells, which results in its further nuclear accumulation. These findings reveal a connection between PKD3 and PKC and support a novel mechanism by which GPCR-mediated activation of the closely related serine/threonine kinases of the PKD family can potentially generate diverse physiological responses based on their unique subcellular distribution. Panc-1 cells, obtained from American Type Cell Collection, are epithelioid cells originally obtained from human ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Panc-1 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 4 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. COS-7 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were obtained from American Type Cell Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 10% CO2 and 90% air. For biochemical analysis, cells were subcultured to 80–90% confluence in 10-cm dishes and transfections or cotransfections were carried out with equivalent amounts of DNA (10 μg/dish). Transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM using Lipofectin according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h before analysis. For live cell analysis, cells were plated onto 15-mm number 1 round glass coverslips inside 33-mm dishes at 7 × 104 cells/dish and transfected 18–20 h later, a time that we previously found optimum to detect very low levels of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged proteins (41Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with 1 μg of DNA/33-mm dish using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's suggested conditions. For immunocytochemistry, the cells were plated in 33-mm dishes at 7 × 104 cells/dish and transfected as indicated above with 1 μg/DNA dish. Transfected cells were incubated for 18 h before live or fixed cell imaging. To detect the expression of sequences encoding PKD, PKD2, and PKD3 in Panc-1 cells we employed reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) with specific oligonucleotide primers designed using the public domain Primer3 program (52Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar). 2Developed by the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research and available at www-genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi. The cDNA sequences used to design the primers were based on the published PKD (10Johannes F.J. Prestle J. Eis S. Oberhagemann P. Pfizenmaier K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6140-6148Google Scholar) and PKD2 (12Sturany S. Van Lint J. Muller F. Wilda M. Hameister H. Hocker M. Brey A. Gern U. Vandenheede J. Gress T. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3310-3318Google Scholar) sequences. For PKD3, we designed specific primers with the Primer3 program based on the cDNA sequence obtained from expressed sequence tag deduction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (11Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar). The primers sequences for PKD were, sense primer 5′-GAGATGGCTTGCTCCATTGT-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 235–254 and the antisense primer 5′-TCGCCTTCCTGGATATCACT-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 361–380, considering for both primers as nucleotide number 1 the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon. The primers sequences for PKD2 were, sense primer 5′-CACCTTCGAGGACTTCCAGA-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 404–421 and the antisense primer 5′-CAGCGCTTGTGGTAGTTCAG-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 537–556, considering for both primers as nucleotide number 1 the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon. The primers sequences for PKD3 were, sense primer 5′-TCAGCCCAGAAGTCTGTATTACCC-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 25–48 and the antisense primer 5′-TGGAGTTGGTGAGTGATGGTGC-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 139–160, considering for both primers as nucleotide number 1 the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of total RNA extracted from Panc-1 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was synthesized at 45 °C by using the designed PKD, PKD2, or PKD3 antisense oligonucleotides described above and ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. A fraction of the obtained cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase high fidelity (Invitrogen), as suggested by the manufacturer, and the sense and antisense primers specific for PKD, PKD2, or PKD3 are indicated above. As controls, in a set of reactions the sense primers for PKD, PKD2, or PKD3 were not added to the obtained cDNAs during the PCR amplification step. The products of PCR were resolved in 2.5% NuSieve GTG-agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME), 1× TBE buffer (100 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4). The gel was stained for 60 min with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/ml) in 1× TBE, follow with two 15-min washes with distilled water. Gel was viewed and images captured using a Gel Doc 1000 system (Bio-Rad). The predicted sizes of the RT-PCR products for PKD, PKD2, and PKD3 were 145, 152, and 135 bp, respectively. Primers for the synthesis of the cDNA encoding PKD3 were designed with the Primer3 program using the cDNA sequence obtained from expressed sequence tag deduction and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (11Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar). The sense primer was 5′-CGGGGTACCTCAGATGTCTGCAAATAATTCCCCT-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions –3 to 21 and the antisense primer was 5′-CGGGGTACCGAAGAACAAGTTACACAGCA-3′ corresponding to nucleotide positions 2725–2746, considering for both primers as nucleotide number 1 the first nucleotide of the ATG initiation codon. Total RNA (3 μg) extracted from Panc-1 cells using TRIzol reagent was employed as template for the synthesis at 55 °C of the cDNA encoding PKD3 using the ThermoScript reverse transcriptase and the antisense primers indicated above. A fraction of the obtained cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Platinum TaqDNA polymerase high fidelity, as suggested by the manufacturer, and the sense and antisense primers indicated above. The PCR products were digested with KpnI and resolved in a 1% agarose gel, 1× TBE buffer. The band with the predicted size for PKD3 was eluted from the gel and cloned into a vector encoding the green fluorescent protein, pEGFP-C3 (BD Biosciences and Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), previously digested with KpnI. The obtained construct, pGFP-PKD3, was verified by DNA sequence analysis and the products of expression analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against GFP. The deduced amino acid sequence for the PKD3 cDNA clone obtained from Panc-1 cells was identical to the published one (11Hayashi A. Seki N. Hattori A. Kozuma S. Saito T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 99-106Google Scholar). The product of expression of pGFP-PKD3 matched the predicted protein size and did not show any degradation. The cDNA encoding PKD3 was isolated from pGFP-PKD3 using KpnI and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-4 (Sigma), previously digested with KpnI. The obtained construct, pFLAG-PKD3, was verified by DNA sequence analysis and the product of expression analyzed by Western blot using the murine monoclonal antibodies M2 and M5 (Sigma) against the FLAG epitope. The vectors encoding the chimeric fusion protein between GFP and PKD or PKD2 were previously described (29Matthews S. Iglesias T. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 515-521Google Scholar, 51Rey O. Yuan J. Rozengurt E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 302: 817-824Google Scholar). A schematic representation of the employed constructs is shown in Fig. 1B. The constitutively active PKC clones η, ϵ, and ζ were obtained from Peter Parker, Protein Phosphorylation Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund (53Dekker L.V. McIntyre P. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19498-19504Google Scholar, 54Genot E.M. Parker P.J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9833-9839Google Scholar). Dr. J. Battey (Laboratory of Molecular Biology, NIDCD, National Institutes of Health) kindly provided the vector bNR-pCD2 containing the cDNA encoding the bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide receptor. Transfected cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and equilibrated in 5 ml of the same medium at 37 °C for 1–2 h before treating the cultures with NT (100 nm), bombesin (10 nm), or phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu) (200 nm) for 10 min. The cells were then lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, hydrochloride (Pefabloc), 1% Triton X-100) and the fusion or endogenous PKD or PKD3 proteins were immunoprecipitated at 4 °C for 3 h with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP, murine monoclonal (M2 and M5) anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-PKD (PA-1), or rabbit anti-PKD3 (N17) antibodies. The immune complexes were recovered using protein A or protein G coupled to agarose for the rabbit polyclonal or murine monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Immune complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer, then twice with kinase buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Autophosphorylation reactions were initiated by combining 20 μl of immune complexes with 5 μl of a phosphorylation mixture containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 400–600 cpm/pmol) in kinase buffer. Following incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reactions were terminated by addition of 1 ml of ice-cold kinase buffer and placed on ice. Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the proteins were extracted for SDS-PAGE analysis by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm EDTA, 6% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 4% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol). Dried SDS-PAGE gels were subjected to autoradiography to visualize radiolabeled protein bands. Samples of cell lysates were directly solubilized by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Following SDS-PAGE on 8% gels, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and blocked by overnight incubation with 5% nonfat dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2. Membranes were incubated at room temperature for 3 h with rabbit antiserum specifically recognizing GFP, PKD3 (N17), or the murine monoclonal antibodies recognizing the FLAG epitope diluted in PBS containing 3% nonfat dried milk. To determine the phosphorylation/activation state of the different PKD isoforms, the membranes were incubated with the Aloop antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated state of the equivalent serines within the activation loop of the three PKD isoforms (PKD: Ser744-Ser748; PKD2: Ser706-Ser710; PKD3: Ser731-Ser735) (Refs. 36Waldron R.T. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 154-163Google Scholar, 50Sturany S. Van Lint J. Gilchrist A. Vandenheede J.R. Adler G. Seufferlein T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29431-29436Google Scholar, and this article). Live Cell Imaging—To maintain a constant temperature of 37 °C during the experimental procedures, cells were grown on the 15-mm glass coverslips and subsequently mounted in a perfusion chamber (RC-25 Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) and perfused with medium preheated at 37 °C by a SH-27B solution in-line heater (Warner Instrument Corp.). The medium was supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The perfusion chamber was mounted on an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) and cells were imaged with a Zeiss water immersion objective (Achroplan ×40/0.75w, Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany). Images were captured as uncompressed 24-bit TIFF files with a SPOT cooled (–12 °C) single CCD color digital camera (three pass method) driven by SPOT version 2.1 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). GFP fluorescence was observed with a HI Q filter set for fluorescein isothiocyanate (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT). Fifty cells were analyzed per experiment and each experiment was performed in triplicate. The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 90% of the population of positive cells. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Indirect immunofluorescence was performed in 10% buffered formalin phosphate fixed, 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS permeabilized cultures. After extensive PBS washing, fixed cells were incubated for 18 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer (PBS, 1% gelatin-0.05% Tween 20) (BB) and then stained at 25 °C for 60 min with a mixture of murine monoclonal antibodies M2 and M5, which are directed against the FLAG epitope. Subsequently, the cells were washed with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 at 25 °C and stained at 25 °C for 60 min with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse diluted in BB and washed again with PBS, 0.05% Tween 20. The samples were then stained at 25 °C for 10 min with DAPI (4′,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole) (300 nm) diluted in PBS. After several PBS washes, the samples were mounted with a gelvatol-glycerol solution containing 2.5% 1,4-diazobicyclo[2.2.2]octane (41Rey O. Young S.H. Cantrell D. Rozengurt E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32616-32626Google Scholar). The samples were examined and imaged with an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioskop) and a Zeiss oil immersion objective (Plan-Apochromat ×40/1.0, Carl Zeiss Inc., Jena, Germany). Images were captured as uncompressed 24-bit TIFF files with a SPOT cooled (–12 °C) single CCD color digital camera (three pass method) driven by SPOT version 2.1 software (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc.). Fluorescein or DAPI signals were observed with HI Q filter sets for fluorescein isothiocyanate or DAPI, respectively (Chroma Technology). The selected cells displayed in the appropriate figures were representative of 80% of the population of positive cells. FLIP—FLIP experiments were performed on a Zeiss LSM310 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Inc.) using a ×100/1.0 water immersion lens. First, a control image was obtained at focal plane at a depth approximately midway through the cell using the 488-nm line of the Argon laser for excitation of GFP with an attenuation of 90% and stored as 8-bit TIFF file. Then a small rectangular region of interest was defined within the cytoplasm or nuclei, the laser attenuation was completely removed and the region of interest (noted by white outlined areas in the Fig. 6) was continuously scanned at 488 and 514 nm at full laser power for 2 min (cytoplasm) or 30 s (nuclei) by using the LSM software provided with the Zeiss 310 microscope, resulting in continuous photo-bleaching (loss of fluorescence) of any molecule within that region. In time, freely moving molecules located previously outside of the region of interest will diffuse into that region and become photobleached, resulting in a time-dependent loss of fluorescence within the larger area (cytoplasm or nucleus). At the end of the bleaching period, laser attenuation and excitation wavelengths were restored to those of the control image, and the fluorescence throughout the cell was monitored at various time intervals. During experiments, a constant temperature of 37 °C was maintained following the methodology described"
https://openalex.org/W2104075210,"Edema factor (EF) and CyaA are adenylyl cyclase toxins secreted by pathogenic bacteria that cause anthrax and whooping cough, respectively. Using the structure of the catalytic site of EF, we screened a data base of commercially available, small molecular weight chemicals for those that could specifically inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity of EF. From 24 compounds tested, we have identified one quinazoline compound, ethyl 5-aminopyrazolo[1,5-<i>a</i>]quinazoline-3-carboxylate, that specifically inhibits adenylyl cyclase activity of EF and CyaA with ∼20 μm <i>K</i> <sub>i</sub>. This compound neither affects the activity of host resident adenylyl cyclases type I, II, and V nor exhibits promiscuous inhibition. The compound is a competitive inhibitor, consistent with the prediction that it binds to the adenine portion of the ATP binding site on EF. EF is activated by the host calcium sensor, calmodulin. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopic analysis shows that this compound does not affect the binding of calmodulin to EF. This compound is dissimilar from a previously described, non-nucleoside inhibitor of host adenylyl cyclase. It may serve as a lead to design antitoxins to address the role of adenylyl cyclase toxins in bacterial pathogenesis and to fight against anthrax and whooping cough."

https://openalex.org/W2004088328,"Mechanisms underlying prostate cancer (CaP) initiation and progression are poorly understood. A chromosomal instability mechanism leading to the generation of numerical and structural chromosomal changes has been implicated in the preneoplastic and neoplastic stages of CaP. Telomere dysfunction is one potential mechanism associated with the onset of such instability. To determine whether there was alteration in telomere length and chromosome number, 15 paraffin-embedded prostatectomy specimens were investigated using quantitative peptide nucleic acid (PNA) FISH analysis of representative foci of carcinoma, putative precancerous lesions (high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, HPIN) and nondysplastic prostate epithelium. A significant decrease in telomere length was shown in both HPIN and CaP in comparison with normal epithelium. In addition, elevated rates of aneusomy suggested that increased levels of chromosomal aberrations were associated with decreased telomere length. Moreover, multiple foci of HPIN were shown to have a heterogeneous overall reduction of telomere length. This reduction was more evident in the histologic regions of the prostate containing CaP. Such observations lend support to the hypothesis that telomere erosion may be a consistent feature of CaP oncogenesis and may also be associated with the generation of chromosomal instability that characterizes this malignancy."
https://openalex.org/W2080194107,"Prion diseases are associated with the conversion of cellular prion protein, PrPC, into a misfolded oligomeric form, PrPSc. Previous studies indicate that salts promote conformational conversion of the recombinant prion protein into a PrPSc-like form. To gain insight into the mechanism of this effect, here we have studied the influence of a number of salts (sodium sulfate, sodium fluoride, sodium acetate, and sodium chloride) on the thermodynamic stability of the recombinant human prion protein. Chemical unfolding studies in urea show that at low concentrations (below ∼50 mm), all salts tested significantly reduced the thermodynamic stability of the protein. This highly unusual response to salts was observed for both the full-length prion protein as well as the N-truncated fragments huPrP90–231 and huPrP122–231. At higher salt concentrations, the destabilizing effect was gradually reversed, and salts behaved according to their ranking in the Hofmeister series. The present data indicate that electrostatic interactions play an unusually important role in the stability of the prion protein. The abnormal effect of salts is likely because of the ion-induced destabilization of salt bridges (Asp144–Arg148 and/or Asp147–Arg151) in the extremely hydrophilic helix 1. Contrary to previous suggestions, this effect is not due to the interaction of ions with the glycine-rich flexible N-terminal region of the prion protein.

Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases are fatal neurological disorders that afflict both animals and humans. The best known animal forms of the disease are scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and chronic wasting disease in deer and elk, whereas the human variants include Creutzfeld-Jacob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease, fatal familial insomnia, and kuru (1Prusiner S.B.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). The main histopathological marker of these diseases is the accumulation in brain of a misfolded form of the prion protein. The latter species, known as PrPSc, 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, scrapie PrP isoform; PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular PrP isoform; PrP-res, proteinase K resistant form of PrP; huPrP90–231, recombinant human prion protein fragment 90–231; huPrP122–231, recombinant human prion protein fragment 122–231. 1The abbreviations used are: PrPSc, scrapie PrP isoform; PrP, prion protein; PrPC, cellular PrP isoform; PrP-res, proteinase K resistant form of PrP; huPrP90–231, recombinant human prion protein fragment 90–231; huPrP122–231, recombinant human prion protein fragment 122–231. accumulates as a result of a conformational conversion of the normal prion protein, PrPC. The PrPC → PrPSc conversion, which occurs as a post-translational process without any detectable covalent modifications to the protein, likely represents a key molecular event in the pathogenesis of prion disorders. It is also believed that PrPSc acts as an infectious agent that self-propagates by catalyzing the conversion of the endogenous PrPC into the pathogenic PrPSc isoform. Although still controversial (4Caughey B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the notion that transmissible spongiform encephalopathies can be transmitted by a mechanism involving self-perpetuating changes in protein conformation is supported by a wealth of experimental data (1Prusiner S.B.

Additional support for the idea that proteins can act as infectious agents has been provided by recent studies on prion-like phenomena in yeast (9Glover J.R. Kowal A.S. Schirmer E.C. Patino M.M.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2799-2807Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Despite an apparent identity of covalent structures, the PrPC and PrPSc isoforms have profoundly different biochemical and biophysical properties. PrPC is a monomeric protein characterized by a high proportion of α-helical conformation and susceptibility to degradation by proteolytic enzymes such as proteinase K. By contrast, PrPSc forms large insoluble oligomers that are rich in β-sheet structure and partially resistant to proteinase K treatment (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

NMR studies have shown that the monomeric form of the recombinant prion protein (a structural model of PrPC) consists of a largely unordered N-terminal part and the folded C-terminal domain encompassing three α-helices and two short β-strands (16Riek R. Hornemann S. Wider G. Billeter M. Glockshuber R. Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar, 17Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E.

Recent crystallographic studies have captured the folded domain as a domain-swapped dimer with an intermolecular disulfide bridge (19Knaus K.J. Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Malone M. Surewicz W.K. Yee V.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). This dimer, which is only marginally populated in solution but selectively crystallizes, is also α-helical, and its overall fold is similar to that of the monomer. In contrast to PrPC, little structural data are available for the oligomeric PrPSc conformer.The molecular mechanism of the self-propagating PrPC → PrPSc conversion remains enigmatic. Nonetheless, certain clues regarding this mechanism have been provided by the cell-free conversion experiments of Caughey and co-workers (7Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3193-3203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and recent studies on conformational transitions of the recombinant prion protein (22Swietnicki W. Morillas M. Chen S.G. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 424-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 23Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 2140-2148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (386) Google Scholar). One intriguing finding of these studies is that the conversion of the recombinant PrP to the oligomeric β-sheet-rich structure (PrPSc-like form) is strongly promoted by the presence of common salts (23Morillas M. Vanik D.L. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6982-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), suggesting the importance of electrostatic interactions in prion protein folding and stability. The role of electrostatic interactions is also indicated by theoretical considerations of Morrissey and Shakhnovich (25Morrissey M.P. Shakhnovich E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11293-11298Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). These authors have noted that helix 1 of PrP is unique among all naturally occurring α-helices with respect to its high polarity and lack of hydrophobic contacts with other parts of the molecule. This helix appears to be stabilized almost exclusively by electrostatic interactions such as intrahelical salt bridges. To gain further insight into the role of electrostatic effects in prion protein conformational transitions, here we have performed systematic studies on the effect of salts on the thermodynamic stability of the recombinant PrP. Our data reveal a highly atypical behavior of prion protein with respect to salt-dependent folding/unfolding equilibria in urea, indicating that electrostatic interaction may play an unusually important role in the stability of PrPC.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction and Protein Purification—Plasmids encoding the full-length human prion protein (huPrP23–231) and the N-terminally truncated fragment huPrP90–231 (with N-terminal linkers containing a His6 tail and a thrombin cleavage site) have been described previously (26Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The construct for the expression of huPrP122–231 was obtained by deleting the segment coding for residues 90–121 in the vector encoding huPrP90–231. This was accomplished using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) and the primers 5′-GCGTGGTTCGGTGGGGGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCCCCACCGAACCACGC-3′. The DNA sequence of the final construct was verified by automatic sequencing. The proteins huPrP23–231 and huPrP90–231 were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and cleaved with thrombin as described previously (26Morillas M. Swietnicki W. Gambetti P. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36859-36865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Zahn R. von Scroetter C. Wuthrich K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). A similar procedure was used for the purification of the N-terminally truncated fragment huPrP121–231, with the exception that the poly-His tail was cleaved using 0.5 unit of biotinylated thrombin (Novagen; 0.5 unit/mg of protein). Following cleavage, the biotinylated thrombin was quantitatively removed using streptavidin immobilized on agarose beads. The purity of the proteins was better than 97% as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The concentration of prion protein variants was determined spectrophotometrically using the molar extinction coefficients, ϵ276, of 56,650, 21,640, and 15,950 m–1 cm–1 for huPrP23–231, huPrP90–231, and huPrP122–231, respectively.Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The far-UV CD spectra (between 190 and 250 nm) were obtained on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. The measurements were performed at 25 °C using a 1-mm path length cell at a protein concentration of 5 μm. Typically, five spectra were averaged to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and the spectra were corrected for small buffer contributions.Equilibrium Unfolding in Urea—The urea-induced unfolding curves of the proteins were obtained at 25 °C using a model JWATS-489 automatic titrator interfaced to a spectropolarimeter. In a typical equilibrium unfolding experiment, two stock solutions of PrP at identical protein concentration (1.4 μm) were prepared: one in buffer alone (native protein) and one in an appropriate buffer containing 9 m urea (unfolded protein). The buffers were composed of 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4) or 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7) and appropriate concentrations of salts studied. For each unfolding/refolding curve, the sample in 9 m urea was titrated (in ∼0.1 m urea increments) to a sample of native protein in a 1-cm path length cell. Upon each urea addition, the mixture was incubated for 10 s, and the ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded for 32 s. In the control experiments, it was verified that the incubation time of less than 1 s is sufficient for the system to reach equilibrium (the unfolding/refolding of the prion protein is very fast, occurring on the millisecond time scale (28Wildegger G. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Apetri A.C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44589-44592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) and that the unfolding and refolding reactions are fully reversible. Prior to the unfolding experiments, urea was deionized using a mixture of anion exchange (trimethylbenzylammonium) and cation exchange (Dowex MR-3) resins. The concentration of the denaturant was determined by measuring the refractive index.Thermal Unfolding Experiments—Thermal unfolding experiments were performed at a protein concentration of 5 μm by monitoring changes in ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of temperature. The measurements were carried out in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, in the presence of 50–250 mm NaCl or Na2SO4. These experiments were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature control system.RESULTSEquilibrium Unfolding Studies in Urea—In the initial experiments, we have focused on the effect of salts on the thermodynamic stability of the recombinant protein corresponding to human PrP fragment 90–231. This region of the protein is of special interest because it encompasses the entire proteinase-resistant sequence found in prion-infected brain and appears to be sufficient for the propagation of the disease (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). The stability of the protein was studied at acidic and neutral pH by measuring the ellipticity at 222 nm as a function of urea concentration. Under the present experimental conditions, the unfolding/refolding curves were fully reversible, and the protein remained monomeric throughout the time course of the experiments. Representative unfolding curves for huPrP90–231, at pH 4, in the absence and presence of NaCl and Na2SO4 are shown in Fig. 1. All these curves are indicative of a cooperative transition between the native and unfolded states. At low concentrations, both sodium chloride and sodium sulfate shifted the unfolding curves to considerably lower urea concentrations. This effect was reversed at high concentrations of Na2SO4 but not NaCl.To obtain a thermodynamic description of salt effect on huPrP90–231 stability, we have used two complementary approaches. In the first approach, the individual denaturation curves were fitted according to a two-state model (30Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1593) Google Scholar), yielding the free energy of unfolding extrapolated to zero denaturant concentration, ΔGUH2O, and the m values. 2It should be noted that the apparently good mathematical fit of experimental data to a two-state model may be fortuitous because equilibrium unfolding data alone are insufficient to prove the applicability of this model. Recent kinetic stopped-flow experiments point to the involvement in prion protein folding of a transient intermediate (29Apetri A.C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44589-44592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, under equilibrium conditions this intermediate is populated at a very low level. Therefore, the ΔΔGU[D]50% values obtained from the analysis of equilibrium unfolding data provide a reliable measure of the total free energy difference between the native and fully unfolded states of the prion protein (29Apetri A.C. Surewicz W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44589-44592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The above parameters for protein unfolding in the presence of varying concentrations of NaCl are shown in Table I. Inspection of the ΔGUH2O values indicates that sodium chloride induces a significant decrease in the thermodynamic stability of huPrP90–231. However, the drawback of this type of analysis is that the ΔGUH2O values are subject to relatively large error because of data extrapolation from the transition region to water. To overcome this problem, we have used an alternative procedure originally proposed by Fersht and co-workers (31Serrano L. Kellis J.T. Cann P. Matouschek A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 783-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 32Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 4322-4329Crossref Scopus (337) Google Scholar). In the latter approach, individual unfolding curves were analyzed in terms of the midpoint unfolding concentration of the denaturant, [D]50%, and the m values. These parameters were then used to obtain ΔΔGU[D]50%, the difference in the free energy of denaturation in the absence and presence of salt at the denaturant concentration at which 50% of the protein is unfolded. The ΔΔGU[D]50% values were calculated according to the formula ΔΔGU[D]50% = 〈m〉Δ[D]50%, where Δ[D]50% is the difference between the value of [D]50% for the protein under the reference conditions (no salt) and in the presence of a given salt, and 〈m〉 is the average value of m under different salt conditions studied. Because the [D]50% values are subject to a very small error, the ΔΔGU[D]50% values provide a more reliable measure of relatively small differences in protein stability than the absolute ΔGUH2O values obtained by extrapolation of experimental data to zero denaturant concentration. It should be noted that the m values for prion protein unfolding in NaCl (Table I) and other salts (data not shown) show no systematic dependence on salt concentration. Therefore, the more accurate approach based on the ΔΔGU[D]50% values is fully applicable to our system. The latter approach has been used throughout the remainder of this study.Table IThermodynamic parameters for equilibrium unfolding of huPrP90-231 in the presence of NaCl[NaCl]mΔGUH2O[D]50%ΔΔGU[D]50%mmkJ/mol/MkJ/molMkJ/molpH 403.50 ± 0.0614.2 ± 0.34.06 ± 0.01203.52 ± 0.0813.2 ± 0.43.75 ± 0.02-1.1 ± 0.1403.48 ± 0.0911.7 ± 0.43.38 ± 0.02-2.4 ± 0.1603.65 ± 0.1012.4 ± 0.43.41 ± 0.03-2.3 ± 0.11003.46 ± 0.1311.6 ± 0.53.34 ± 0.03-2.6 ± 0.12003.45 ± 0.1211.5 ± 0.53.35 ± 0.03-2.5 ± 0.1pH 704.56 ± 0.0826.0 ± 0.65.71 ± 0.02104.63 ± 0.0925.7 ± 0.65.56 ± 0.02-0.7 ± 0.1204.64 ± 0.1025.2 ± 0.65.43 ± 0.02-1.3 ± 0.1404.42 ± 0.0923.8 ± 0.65.39 ± 0.02-1.5 ± 0.1604.65 ± 0.1124.6 ± 0.75.29 ± 0.02-1.9 ± 0.1804.51 ± 0.1224.3 ± 0.85.39 ± 0.03-1.7 ± 0.11004.50 ± 0.1224.2 ± 0.85.37 ± 0.03-1.7 ± 0.1 Open table in a new tab Fig. 2 shows the effect of different salts (NaF, Na2SO4, CH3COONa, NaCl) on the thermodynamic stability of huPrP90–231 at pH 4 as assessed by the ΔΔGU[D]50% values. At low concentrations, all salts studied induced a marked protein destabilization (decrease in ΔΔGU[D]50%). For sodium fluoride, sodium sulfate, and sodium acetate, the destabilizing effect was gradually reversed upon increasing salt concentration between ∼50 and 200 mm. No such reversal was observed for sodium chloride. Accurate measurements at salt concentrations above ∼200 mm were not feasible because of practical limitations of our experimental setup (the use of an automatic titrator) and potential problems resulting from protein aggregation at very high salt concentration.Fig. 2The effect of different salts (NaF, Na2SO4, sodium acetate, NaCl) on the thermodynamic stability of huPrP90–231 in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4. The ΔΔGU[D]50% values represent the difference in stability of huPrP90–231 under the reference conditions (10 mm acetate buffer) and in the presence of a given salt. The ΔΔGU[D]50% values were calculated according to the formula: ΔΔGU[D]50% = 〈m〉Δ[D]50%, where Δ[D]50% represents the concentration of urea at which 50% of the protein is unfolded and 〈m〉 is the average of individual m values at different salt concentrations. ΔGUH2O for urea unfolding of huPrP90–231 at pH 4 in the absence of salts is 14.5 kJ/mol, and the 〈m〉 parameter is 3.5 kJ/mol/m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The observed decrease in the thermodynamic stability of huPrP90–231 in the presence of sodium fluoride, sodium sulfate, sodium acetate, and sodium chloride is highly unusual because these salts are generally known to have a stabilizing effect on proteins (33Timasheff S.N.

To gain insight into the molecular basis of this effect, measurements similar to those described above were performed at neutral pH. Also in this case, a significant destabilization of the protein was observed at low salt concentrations (Fig. 3). However, somewhat higher concentrations of salts were required to produce the maximum destabilizing effect at pH 7 than at pH 4. It should also be noted that, at salt concentrations corresponding to maximum protein destabilization, the absolute decrease in stability was very similar (2–3 kJ/mol) at pH 4 and 7. However, in relative terms, the effect was significantly stronger at acidic pH because ΔGUH2O for huPrP90–231 unfolding (in the absence of salt) is 14.5 and 26.5 kJ/mol at pH 4 and 7, respectively. Similar to the behavior observed under acidic conditions, the destabilizing effect at pH 7 was gradually reversed at higher salt concentrations.Fig. 3The effect of different salts (NaF, Na2SO4, NaCl) on the thermodynamic stability of huPrP90–231 in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7. The ΔΔGU[D]50% values represent the difference in stability of huPrP90–231 under the reference conditions (10 mm Tris buffer) and in the presence of a given salt.

The glycine-rich N-terminal region (missing in huPrP90–231) has been previously suggested to modulate the effect of salts on prion protein stability (37Nandi P.K. Leclerc E. Marc D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11017-11024Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, the present experiments with two selected salts, Na2SO4 and NaCl, clearly indicate that the effect of ions on the stability of the full-length PrP is very similar to that described for huPrP90–231 (Fig. 4). At low concentrations, both salts induced a destabilization of the full-length PrP. This effect was gradually reversed at higher concentrations of Na2SO4 but not NaCl. In another series of experiments, we have probed the effect of salts on the stability of the N-truncated prion protein fragment corresponding to the autonomously folded domain 122–231. Also in this case, Na2SO4 and NaCl at low concentrations induced significant protein destabilization (Fig. 5). Within the accuracy of the present measurements, the magnitude of salt-induced destabilization of huPrP122–231 was similar to that observed for huPrP90–231 and huPrP23–231.Fig. 4The effect of sodium sulfate (▴) and sodium chloride (○) on the thermodynamic stability of the full-length prion protein (huPrP23–231) in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.

However, under most experimental conditions tested, the thermal denaturation of PrP was irreversible and led to protein aggregation. The above effects were especially pronounced at neutral pH and in the presence of salts. Irreversible aggregation of prion protein at elevated temperatures precluded any meaningful thermodynamic analysis of the thermal denaturation curves.DISCUSSIONA number of recent observations have spurred considerable interest in understanding the role of electrostatic interactions and salts in the folding, stability, and conformational conversions of the prion protein. Of particular significance in this respect is the finding that common salts such as NaCl strongly promote the oligomerization and spontaneous conversion of the recombinant prion protein to a β-sheet-rich form with physicochemical properties similar to those of brain PrPSc (23Morillas M.

https://openalex.org/W2002652437,"GATA-1 and c-Myb transcription factors represent key regulators of red blood cell development. GATA-1 is upregulated and c-myb proto-oncogene expression is downregulated when red cell progenitors differentiate into erythrocytes. Here we have employed a culture system, that faithfully recapitulates red blood cell differentiation in vitro, to follow the kinetics of GATA-1 and c-myb expression. We show that c-myb proto-oncogene expression is high in progenitors and effectively downregulated at the time when nuclear GATA-1 accumulates and cells differentiate into erythrocytes. Additionally, we identified two GATA-1 binding sites within the c-myb promoter and demonstrate that GATA-1 protein binds to these sites in vitro. Furthermore, GATA-1 represses c-myb expression through one of the GATA-1 binding sites in transient transfection experiments and this requires FOG-1. Thus, our study provides evidence for a direct molecular link between GATA-1 activity and c-myb proto-oncogene expression during terminal red cell differentiation."

Consistent with this hypothesis, we discovered that p73 interacts physically with various cyclins (A, B, D, and E). Furthermore, cyclin A/CDK1/2, cyclin B/CDK1/2, and cyclin E/CDK2 complexes can phosphorylate multiple p73 isoforms in vitro at threonine 86. A specific antibody directed against phosphorylated Thr86 showed that this site is phosphorylated in vivo and that such phosphorylation is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Thr86 phosphorylation is induced during S phase and is maximal in the G2/M phase. Accordingly inhibitors of cell growth, such as p16 and serum starvation, reduce Thr86 phosphorylation. Finally, we found that cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-dependent Thr86 phosphorylation represses the ability of p73 to induce endogenous p21 expression.

Proteins encoded by these three genes share the same modular organization consisting of an N-terminal transactivation domain, central sequence-specific DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal tetramerization domain. However, the p73 gene encodes multiple isoforms varying in their N and C termini. In some cases, the use of a cryptic promoter generates isoforms lacking the transactivation domain located in the N terminus of p73 (ΔNp73α and ΔNp73β). The p73 gene also generates several forms with varying C-terminal extensions (p73α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ) that are produced by alternative splicing (7De Laurenzi V. Costanzo A. Barcaroli D. Terrinoni A.

We have compared the ability of p73 and p53 to activate a number of p53-responsive reporter constructs (9Di Como C.J. Gaiddon C. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1438-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), whereas in a more physiological context Zhu et al. (10Zhu J. Jiang J. Zhou W. Chen X. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5061-5065PubMed Google Scholar) found significant differences in the abilities of p53 and p73 proteins to activate several targets. The precise functions of p73 proteins in the organism and the signaling pathways that regulate their activity are still not well established. However, various in vitro and in vivo experiments have shown or suggested that, like p53, p73 proteins may play a role both in developmental processes and DNA damage response. Several lines of evidence show that p73 may play a role in nervous system and immune system development. Indeed, p73–/– mice harbor defects in the development of the hippocampus and in the inflammatory response (11Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H.

Several reports have attributed to p73 a role in the response to cellular stress, as has been well described for p53. p73 overexpression can induce apoptosis (1Jost C.A. Marin M.C. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). These observations and the fact that p73 expression is affected in certain tumors suggest that p73 may function as a tumor suppressor gene. However, p73–/– mice are not particularly prone to cancer (11Yang A. Walker N. Bronson R. Kaghad M. Oosterwegel M. Bonnin J. Vagner C. Bonnet H. Dikkes P. Sharpe A. McKeon F. Caput D.

Further, contradictory results have been reported concerning either overexpression or repression of the p73 gene in some cancers.

However, the physiological relevance of these interactions and regulation have not yet been clearly established. Irvin et al. reported that p73 protein levels are regulated through the cell cycle in experiments showing that cells released from serum starvation produce increasing levels of p73 starting at the end of G1 (32Irwin M.

In fact, E2F proteins are transcriptional regulators of p73 expression, and it has been shown that p73 is involved in E2F-dependent apoptosis (12Lissy N.A. Davis P.K. Irwin M. Kaelin W.G. Dowdy S.F.

Because p73 expression is regulated through the cell cycle, we hypothesized that p73 activity might be modulated by cyclin-dependent kinases at a post-translational level. In this study, we analyzed the physical and functional interactions between p73 proteins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK). We found that p73 can interact physically with cyclins and can be phosphorylated by S/G2/M CDK complexes. We identified Thr86 as a phosphorylation site for CDK complexes and showed that Thr86 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner in vivo. Finally, we found that mutation of Thr86 significantly affects p73 transcriptional activity, suggesting a regulatory role for the CDK complexes through this site.

PCDNA constructs encoding CDK1 or CDK2 proteins are a gift from Dr. S. van den Heuvel. pBacp73β were obtained by subcloning a HindIII/XhoI fragment of the CMVp73 expression constructs into the FastBac vector (Invitrogen). Expression and Purification of p73 Proteins and CDK Complexes— Infection, expression, and purification of CDK complexes from insect cells were done as previously described (34Wang Y. Prives C. Nature. 1995; 376: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Generation and amplification of the p73 baculoviruses using the FastBac system were done as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Purification of p73 proteins was performed as described previously (27Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Briefly, Sf9 cells freshly seeded (1 h) at 90% confluence in 20-cm plates (20–40 plates) were infected for 1 h with 500 μl of virus diluted in 2 ml of medium for each plate. After 48 h, the cells were removed from the plates in their medium and washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed for 30 min in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitors, 0,1% aprotinin). The soluble fraction was isolated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 20,000 rpm and added to protein A-Sepharose beads (1–2 ml) cross-linked to HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5) that were rocked overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed two times in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and two times in buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF) and then poured into a 5-ml syringe. After washing with three column volumes of buffer D (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT), p73 proteins were eluted with a HA peptide (final concentration, 10 μg/ml) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. Fractions containing p73 were assessed by SDS-PAGE and pooled according to their similarity in concentration and purity. Reporter Vectors—p21 min luc contains a duplex oligonucleotide encoding the p53-responsive cis-acting element from p21, cloned upstream of the minimal c-fos promoter (–53 to +42) in pGL3-OFLUC (kindly provided by N. Clarke). The synthesized oligonucleotides (Operon Technologies, Inc.) encoding the p21 cis-acting p53-responsive element were as follows: 5′-GATCCTCGAGGAACATGTCCCAACATGTTGCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCAACATGTTGGGACATGTTCCTCGAG-3′. The resulting plasmid was sequenced to determine the orientation and number of inserts of the oligoduplex. Transfection and Luciferase Assays—H1299 and Cos1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The cells were transfected by a lipopolyamine-based (Transfectam™) protocol as described previously (35Gaiddon C. Boutillier A.-L. Monnier D. Mercken L. Loeffler J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22663-22671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in DMEM, 10% FBS and transfected with various amounts of DNA. The precipitate was left on the cells for 6 h, after which fresh DMEM, 10% FBS was added. For luciferase assays, the cells were seeded in 12-well, 3.8-cm2 plates and transfected at 90% confluency with one of the expression vectors (200 ng of each) and two different reporter constructs (250 ng of each), a CMV-expressed luciferase cDNA from Renilla, and a p53-responsive luciferase cDNA from firefly. Luciferase activity was measured in each well 24 h later by a dual luciferase reporter gene assay (Promega). Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation Analysis—H1299 and Cos1 cells in 6-cm plates were transfected with the indicated plasmids (8 μg) and harvested 48 h later. Sf9 cells were infected with 50 μl of virus in six-well plates. The cells were lysed in 300 μl of TEGN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 5 mm PMSF, 100 μm benxamidine, 300 μg/ml leupeptine, 10 μg/ml bacitracine, 100 μg/ml, α-macroglobin and phosphatase inhibitors) (Cocktails I and II; Sigma), and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 12 min to remove cell debris. The protein concentrations were determined using a colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). p73 proteins (400–750 μg of whole cell extract) were incubated with 30 μl of 50% slurry protein A-Sepharose beads cross-linked to an anti-HA antibody (12CA5) followed by rocking at 4 °C for 3 h. After incubation, the samples were washed four times with 1 ml of wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol). Excess liquid was aspirated, 35 μl of sample buffer (36Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) was added, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 3 min and centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 rpm, followed by electrophoresis through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). For HA detection, the 16B12 monoclonal HA antibody (Babco; 1 mg/ml) was used at 1:1000. TP phosphorylation was observed using a phospho-specific TP antibody (New England Biolabs; 1:5000). Thr86 phosphorylation was followed with a Thr(P)86 antibody, antigen-purified, and used at a dilution of 1:1000. To assess p73-regulated p21 expression, the cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 1 μg of p73 expression vector (or control vector), 3 μg of dnCDK1 (or control vector), and 0.2 μg of EGFP expressing vector. The cells were lysed 20 h after transfection, and the proteins were separated on a 10% SDS gel. For each point, two wells were transfected, and lysates were mixed. p21 protein was detected using a monoclonal p21 antibody (Pharmingen, clone SX118, 1/500). Cyclin immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed with a monoclonal anti-cyclin A antibody (1:50 and 1:1000, respectively; Sigma). The proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Biosciences). GST Pull Down—Interactions with purified proteins were assessed in a buffer containing 2 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor. Immunopurified GST-cyclin A (300 ng) was incubated for 30 min with anti-GST beads (glutathione-Sepharose 4B; Pharmacia Corp.; 20 μl). After two washes, HA-p73β proteins (100 ng) were added and incubated for another 30 min. Then beads were washed five times with a TEGN buffer containing 250 mm NaCl. The samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, centrifuged for 3 min at 13,000 × rpm, electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. GST and GST-cyclin A were detected with a GST antibody (Ab3; Oncogene Research Products; 1:1000). In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Immunopurified p73β or RB proteins (100 ng) were incubated in the presence of immunopurified cyclin/CDK complexes (100 ng) in 20 μl of a kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP, 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of 10 μlof3× sample buffer, the proteins were separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. The purity and the quantity of the proteins used in the assay were verified simultaneously by SDS-PAGE gel separation and silver staining. FACS Analysis—FACS analysis was performed as described by Lamm et al. (37Lamm G.M. Steinlein P. Cotten M. Christofori G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4855-4857Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in a fixative buffer (100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8) for 20 min and then in 95% methanol for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and exposed to propidium iodide (60 μg/ml), and RNase A (50 μg/ml) for 30 min before analysis (FACScalibur; Becton Dickinson) for DNA content (propidium iodyide) with a 610-nm long pass filter. An excitation wavelength of 488 nm was used for propidium iodyide. The data were analyzed using CELLQuest software (Becton Dickinson). p73 Proteins Are Phosphorylated by Cyclin-dependent Kinases—We identified in p73 a consensus phosphorylation site for CDK complexes (*T86PEH). To support the likelihood that p73 may be phosphorylated by CDKs, insect cells (Sf9 cells) were co-infected with HA-tagged p73β expressing baculovirus (27Gaiddon C. Lokshin M. Ahn J. Zhang T. Prives C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1874-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and a combination of cyclin and CDK expressing baculoviruses (Fig. 1A). The cells were lysed 48 h after infection, the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and p73 expression was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody (HA.11). As shown in panel A, p73 gel migration was retarded when it was co-expressed with cyclin A/CDK2, cyclin B/CDK1(cdc2), or cyclin E/CDK2 but not when co-expressed with cyclin D/CDK4, suggesting that a subset of CDK complexes can indeed induce post-translational modification of p73 polypeptide. Infection with increasing amounts of CDK2 baculovirus reduced overall p73 expression (shifted plus nonshifted polypeptides), which might be due to competition or a squelching effect between the co-infecting recombinant baculoviruses (Fig. 1B). However, we observed that at the highest quantity of CDK2, ∼50% of the total amount of p73 polypeptide was shifted (Fig. 1B). To confirm that the retarded migration was due to phosphorylation of p73, the extracts were treated with alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Fig. 1B). This treatment prevented the shift in p73 migration, indicating that the shift was caused by CDK-induced phosphorylation of p73 in insect cells. To further investigate whether p73 is a direct target of CDK complexes, we performed in vitro protein kinase assays using immunopurified proteins. Rb, which is a well known substrate for all of the common CDK complexes, was used for comparison in these experiments (38Reed S.I. Cancer Surveys. 1997; 29: 7-23PubMed Google Scholar). Similar amounts of purified p73 and Rb proteins were used as substrates for purified cyclin A/CDK2, cyclin D/CDK4, and cyclin E/CDK2 (Fig. 1C, right panel, silver-stained gel). As expected, all three CDK complexes phosphorylated Rb protein in vitro (Fig. 1C, left panel). In the same experimental conditions, p73 was phosphorylated far more efficiently by cyclin A/CDK2 than by cyclin E/CDK2. No phosphorylation of p73 by cyclin D/CDK4 was observed under conditions that allowed Rb phosphorylation by this kinase. Thus, p73 proteins can serve as substrates for cyclin A/CDK2 and cyclin E/CDK2 but not for cyclin D/CDK4. Because the p73 gene encodes multiple isoforms varying in their C or N termini, we compared the ability of the different isoforms to be phosphorylated by the CDK using the same approach. Upon co-infection of insect cells with cyclin A and CDK2 expressing baculoviruses, we found that at least three isoforms (p73α, p73β, and p73γ) displayed a mobility shift (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the CDK phosphorylation site(s) is located in the common portion of the various p73 isoforms. Our experiments indicate that p73 proteins are direct targets for a subset of CDK complexes. The fact that they phosphorylate p73 in vitro with a similar efficiency to Rb, leading to a gel mobility shift in p73 migration, suggests that p73 is a good substrate for S/G2/M CDK complexes. p73 Proteins Interact with Cyclins—In some cases, phosphorylation by CDK complexes is associated with a direct interaction between the cyclin and the substrate through a cyclin recognition motif (CRM): RXL or KXL. The p73 protein sequence exhibits two potential CRM sites (position 149, KKL; position 515, RAL), suggesting that p73 may interact with cyclins. The first CRM is located in the core domain of the protein (position 149, KKL) and is common to all p73 isoforms (see Fig. 3A). The second CRM is located in the extreme C-terminal part of the p73α isoform at position 515 (RAL; Fig. 3A). We first examined the interaction between p73 and cyclins in insect cells co-infected with baculoviruses expressing HA-tagged p73 and GST-tagged cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, or cyclin D (Fig. 2A). Infected cells were lysed 48 h after infection, GST-tagged cyclins were pulled down with GST beads, and HA-p73 proteins were detected by immunoblotting using an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, p73β was present in the complex with cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, and cyclin D. Co-expression of cyclin A and cyclin B with CDK2 and CDK1, respectively, did not significantly interfere with the ability of p73 to co-immunoprecipitate with these cyclins. Interestingly, co-expression of cyclin E and cyclin D with CDK2 and CDK4 reduced the amount of p73 proteins in the complex. Moreover, when we compared the ability of p73α and p73β to co-precipitate with cyclins, we observed better co-precipitation between p73α and cyclin A, although p73β is expressed at higher levels than p73α (Fig. 2B). This suggests that both CRM sequences participate in the interaction between cyclins and p73α. To confirm that the physical interaction between p73 and the cyclins is direct, co-immunoprecipitation experiments using immunopurified proteins were performed (Fig. 2C). Purified p73β proteins were pulled down with GST-tagged cyclin A protein but not with GST alone. We estimate that ∼5% of each protein is associated with each other (Input = 10% of the purified protein used for the immunoprecipitation; Fig. 2C, left panel).Fig. 2p73 proteins interact with cyclins. A and B, p73 co-precipitates with cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, and cyclin D. p73α, p73β, cyclin A, cyclin B, cyclin E, cyclin D, CDK2, and CDK4 were co-expressed as indicated in insect cells for 48 h. The proteins were extracted in TEGN buffer, and GST-cyclin A (A and B), GST-cyclin B (A), or GST-cyclin D (A) were immunoprecipitated (IP) in presence of anti-GST beads (Pharmacia Corp.) and cyclin E with a"

Pretreatment of neutrophils with LY294002 or PP1 (inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and Src kinases, respectively) partly reversed the β2 integrin-induced down-regulation of Rac activities. In contrast, β2 integrins induced stimulation of Cdc42 that was independent of Src family members. The PI 3-kinase dependence of the β2 integrin-mediated decrease in GTP-bound Rac could be explained by an enhanced Rac-GAP activity, since this activity was blocked by LY204002, whereas PP1 only had a minor effect. The fact that only Rac1 but not Rac2 (the dominating Rac) redistributed to the detergent-insoluble fraction and that it was independent of GTP loading excludes the possibility that down-regulation of Rac activities was due to depletion of GTP-bound Rac from the detergent-soluble fraction. The β2 integrin-triggered relocalization of Rac1 to the cytoskeleton was enabled by a PI 3-kinase-induced dissociation of Rac1 from LyGDI. The dissociations of Rac1 and Rac2 from LyGDI also explained the PI 3-kinase-dependent translocations of Rac GTPases to the plasma membrane. However, these accumulations of Rac in the membrane, as well as that of p47phox and p67phox, were also regulated by Src tyrosine kinases. Inasmuch as Rac GTPases are part of the NADPH oxidase and the respiratory burst is elicited in neutrophils adherent by β2 integrins, our results indicate that activation of the NADPH oxidase does not depend on the levels of Rac-GTP but instead requires a β2 integrin-induced targeting of the Rac GTPases as well as p47phox and p67phox to the plasma membrane.

This is followed by ingestion of the invading microbes, resulting in their dissolution, largely through the release of granule contents into the phagolysosome and generation of oxygen radicals by the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase (1von Andrian U.H. Chambers J.D. McEvoy L.M. Bargatze R.F. Arfors K.E. Butcher E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7538-7542Google Scholar). Several of the above functional responses are mediated by integrin-mediated cell adhesion (2Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1550-1560Google Scholar), including a dynamic rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (3Löfgren R. Ng-Sikorski J. Sjölander A. Andersson T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1597-1605Google Scholar). Members of the β2 integrin family are the dominating integrins expressed on PMNs. β2 integrins are noncovalently associated heterodimers composed of a common β-chain, CD18, and one of four unique α-chains (CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, or CD11d), with CD11b/CD18 being the most prominent on PMNs (4Sanchez-Madrid F. Nagy J.A. Robbins E. Simon P. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1785-1803Google Scholar, 5Gahmberg C.G. Tolvanen M. Kotovuori P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 215-232Google Scholar, 6Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Google Scholar). Engagement of β2 integrins on PMNs triggers activation of various nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, such as Src family members (p58c-fgr (Fgr), p59/61hck (Hck), and p53/56lyn (Lyn)), the non-Src tyrosine kinases p72syk (Syk) and Pyk2 (7Berton G. Yan S.R. Fumagalli L. Lowell C.A. Int. J. Clin. Lab. Res. 1996; 26: 160-177Google Scholar, 8Dib K. Andersson T. Front. Biosci. 1996; 5: d438-d451Google Scholar), and the lipid kinase PI 3-kinase (3Löfgren R. Ng-Sikorski J. Sjölander A. Andersson T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1597-1605Google Scholar), and it generates a phospholipase C-γ2-dependent calcium signal (9Hellberg C. Molony L. Zheng L. Andersson T. Biochem. J. 2000; 317: 403-409Google Scholar). GTP-binding proteins of the Rho subfamily, which belongs to the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, are necessary for regulation of PMN functions. For example, the motile potential of PMNs is largely due to the formation of membrane protrusions, a process that requires relocalization and activation of Rac and Cdc42 (as well as other signaling molecules such as PI 3-kinase) at the leading edge of these motile cells (10Worthylake R.A. Burridge K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 569-577Google Scholar). The requirement for Rho GTPases in these functional events can readily be ascribed to their dynamic regulation of the actin-based cytoskeleton, similar to that described in many other cell models (11Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Google Scholar, 12Aspenström P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Google Scholar). In PMNs, Rac and Cdc42 are involved in actin nucleation (13Arcaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 805-813Google Scholar, 14Zigmond S.H. Joyce M. Borleis J. Bokoch G.M. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 363-374Google Scholar); Rac promotes dissociation of gelsolin from actin filaments (13Arcaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 805-813Google Scholar), and Cdc42 activates WASP proteins and the ARP2/3 complex (15Glogauer M. Hartwig J. Stossel T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 785-796Google Scholar). In addition to participating in regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics, Rac1 and Rac2 are part of the multicomponent, plasma membrane-bound enzyme NADPH oxidase; however, the exact role that Rac GTPases play in the regulation of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells has not yet been completely elucidated (16Bokoch G.M. Curr. Biol. 1994; 6: 212-218Google Scholar, 17Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Google Scholar). These small GTP-binding proteins cycle between a GDP-bound inactive form to a GTP-bound active form (18Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar). In their inactive form, Rho GTPases are bound to proteins called GDIs (RhoGDI and LyGDI), which compete more efficiently in vivo for GDP-bound than for GTP-bound Rho GTPases (19Abo A. Webb M.R. Grogan A. Segal A.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 585-591Google Scholar). GDI-bound Rho GTPases are found in the cytosol, because their C-terminal, lipid-modified end is inserted into a hydrophobic pocket of the immunoglobulin-like domain of the GDI molecule, which prevents the Rho GTPases from interacting with the membrane (20Hoffman G.R. Nassar N. Cerione R. Cell. 2000; 100: 345-356Google Scholar). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors, activated by extracellular stimuli, are responsible for the GDP-GTP switch. In their GTP-bound state, these proteins interact with specific effectors to initiate downstream signals and functions. The subsequent hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP is catalyzed by the family of GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). We have recently shown that ligation of the β2 integrins on PMNs resulted in activation of Ras (21Zheng L. Sjölander A. Eckerdal J. Andersson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8431-8436Google Scholar) and RhoA (22Dib K. Melander F. Andersson T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6311-6322Google Scholar), but it is not yet known whether other Rho GTPases are also regulated in the course of this event. In the present study, we examined β2 integrin-dependent regulation of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases in adherent PMNs. Antibodies—The antibodies and their sources were as follows. mAb IB4 (mouse anti-human CD18, IgG2a isotype) was originated by Dr. S. Wright (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) (23Wright S.D. Rao P.E. van Voorhiss W.C. Craigmyle L.S. Iida K. Talle M.A. Westberg E.F. Goldstein G. Silverstein S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 18: 5699-5703Google Scholar); rabbit anti-Rac2 and goat anti-LyGDI antisera were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); mAbs anti-Cdc42, anti-Rac1, anti-Rac, anti-p47phox, and anti-p67phox were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); peroxidase-conjugated IgGs and IgG2a control antibody were obtained from Dakopatts (Glostrup, Denmark). Chemicals—Protein G-Sepharose was from Oncogene™ (Germany); protein A-Sepharose, Dextran, and Ficoll-Hypaque were purchased from Amersham Biosciences; and the protease inhibitors pefabloc, pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, and antipain were from Roche Applied Science. Benzamidine, LY294002, and wortmanin were obtained from Sigma, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP1 was from Alexis Biochemicals, and all electrophoresis reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from Sigma. Isolation of Human PMNs—Blood was collected from healthy donors, and PMNs were isolated under endotoxin-free conditions as previously described (24Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. Suppl. 1968; 97: 31-50Google Scholar). In short, the blood was subjected to dextran sedimentation followed by a brief hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes. The lysis was stopped by adding 3 ml of buffer A (565 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 6.7 mm Na2HPO4 2H2O, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) and 3 ml of Ringer's modified phosphate buffer, KRG (120 mm NaCl, 4.9 mm KCl, 1.7 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO47H2O, 8.3 mm Na2HPO42H2O, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.3). The cell suspension was then centrifuged on Ficoll-Hypaque (15 ml) and washed twice with KRG buffer. Finally, the pelleted cells were resuspended in a calcium-containing medium (136 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 5.0 mm NaHCO3, 1.1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 5.5 mm glucose, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4). The cell suspension consisted of ∼97% PMNs. Ligation of β2Integrins—For adhesion of PMNs, Petri dishes (Easy Grip™) containing 20 μg/ml fibrinogen in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were incubated either overnight at 4 °C or for 2 h at room temperature and then washed twice with PBS and once with calcium-containing medium. PMNs (20 × 106) were subsequently incubated in the fibrinogen-coated dishes at 37 °C in the presence of TNF (20 ng/ml) for different periods of time. For treatment of suspended PMNs, polypropylene tubes (15 ml) were blocked for 2 h with 10% fetal calf serum and then rinsed extensively with PBS and once with calcium-containing medium, after which the cells (106/ml) were incubated in the tubes under gentle rotation at 37 °C in the absence (control cells) or presence of TNF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated periods of time. The reactions were terminated by putting the Petri dishes or tubes on ice. GST Pull-down Assays and Western Blotting—The cDNA of the Rac and Cdc42 binding domain from PAK1B (PAKcrib; amino acids 56–267) was cloned into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2T and was expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (25Edlund S. Landström M. Heldin C.H. Aspenström P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 902-914Google Scholar). PMNs were lysed in a buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin; pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain (1 μg/ml each); 2.5 mm benzamidine; 2 mm pefabloc). Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the Triton X-100-soluble fraction was recovered. A bacterial lysate containing the GST-PAKcrib fusion protein was added to PMNs lysates together with glutathione-Sepharose beads. After 1 h, the beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 100 mm NaCl, and 30 mm MgCl2. The beads were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled under reducing conditions for 5 min. The precipitated proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyscreen PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 3% milk and then incubated for 1 h with a primary antibody (1 μg/ml dilution of anti-Rac2, anti-Cdc42, or anti-Rac Abs or 0.15 μg/ml anti-Rac1 mAb) and thereafter washed three times for 5 min in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20. The membranes were subsequently incubated for 1 h with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgGs (1:10,000) in PBS supplemented with 0.2% Tween 20 and 3% milk. The blots were extensively washed, and antibody binding was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Measurement of NADPH Oxidase Activity—Nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) is an electron acceptor used to indirectly detect the production of superoxide by PMNs (26Baehner R.L. Nathan D.G. N. Engl. J. Med. 1968; 278: 971-976Google Scholar). Upon electron acceptance, soluble and yellow NBT is converted to blue-black formazan that can be quantitated spectrophotometrically after extraction from cells with N,N-dimethylformamide. Briefly, PMNs (2.5 × 106/ml) in calcium-containing medium were preincubated with 0.2% NBT for 10 min, after which PMNs were plated on fibrinogen-coated plates in the presence of TNF for the indicated time periods. Suspended PMNs were taken as control cells (zero time point). Thereafter, adherent cells (5 × 106) were scraped off, and the total cell suspension was transferred to Eppendorf tubes. The tubes were spun for 3 min, and the resulting pellets were dissolved in 1 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide and left at 56 °C for 1 h. The tubes were then again spun for 3 min, after which the optical densities (515 nm) of cell extracts were determined in a spectrophotometer. The OD values obtained from resting cells ranged between 0.07 and 0.1. Measurement of Rac-GAP Activity in PMN Lysates—PMNs (30 × 106) were lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pefabloc, 1 μg/ml pepstatin and antipain), and the lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min). The Rac-GAP assay was performed essentially as described elsewhere (27Molnár G. Dagher. M.C. Geiszt M. Settleman J. Ligeti E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10542-10549Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, 10 μl of precleared lysates (containing about 50 μg of proteins) were incubated in 30 μl of Rac-GAP buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm GTP) for 5 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the reaction was initiated by adding 4 μl of [γ-32P]GTP-loaded Rac1, and the sample was incubated for 5 min at room temperature under shaking. The reaction was stopped by adding 0.2 ml of ice-cold Rac-GAP buffer and placing the samples on ice for 2 min. Aliquots (50 μl) were filtered through nitrocellulose filters (0.45-mm pore size) under vacuum, and the filters were washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 5 mm MgCl2). The filters were then air-dried and placed in plastic vials. 5 ml of scintillation mixture (Ready Gel; Beckman) was added, and radioactivity bound to the filters was measured using a scintillation counter. To achieve GTP loading of Rac1, 1–3 μg of affinity-purified histidine-tagged Rac1 (expressed in Sf9 cells) was incubated at room temperature for 5 min in loading buffer (16 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 5 mm EDTA, 100 nm GTP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]GTP with a specific activity of 5000 Ci/mmol). Thereafter, MgCl2 (20 mm) was added to block further nucleotide exchange activity, and the tubes were placed on ice. An aliquot was filtered through a nitrocellulose filter, and the filter was washed three times with wash buffer (see above). The radioactivity remaining on the filters was counted and considered as total bound Rac1 (100%). Pretreatment of PMNs with Anti-β2Integrin Antibodies—PMNs (10 × 106/ml) were resuspended in calcium-containing medium in polypropylene tubes and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 15 μg/ml IB4 antibody or isotype-matched IgG2a monoclonal antibody. Thereafter, the cells were placed on dishes coated with fibrinogen and stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml). The reactions were terminated by placing the dishes on ice, after which GST-PAKcrib pull-down assays were performed (see above). Immunoprecipitation—PMNs were lysed by adding the following lysis buffer: 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain; 2.5 mm benzamidine; 2 mm pefabloc). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10 min at 15,000 × g), and LyGDI in the supernatants was immunoprecipitated by exposure to the anti-LyGDI antiserum (3 μg/ml) for 2 h and then to 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose for 45 min. The beads were subsequently collected by centrifugation and washed three times in a wash buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1%, SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4). The beads were then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled under reducing conditions for 5 min. The immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to electrophoresis on 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyscreen PVDF transfer membranes. To detect Rac in the anti-LyGDI immunoprecipitates, the membranes were incubated with either anti-Rac1 mAb or anti-Rac2 antiserum and subsequently with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (1:10,000), as described under “GST Pull-down Assays and Western Blotting.” Determination of the Translocation of Cytosolic Components of the NADPH Oxidase—PMNs were scraped off from the Petri dishes, suspended in disruption buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (20 μg/ml aprotinin; 1 μg/ml each pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain; 2.5 mm benzamidine; 2 mm pefabloc)), and then placed in a cell disruption bomb at 4 °C (28Klempner M.S. Mikkelsen R.B. Corfman D.H. André-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 21-28Google Scholar). The bomb was equilibrated at 1000 p.s.i. for 10 min, after which the pressure was quickly released. The cell suspension was subsequently centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet nuclei, heavy membrane fractions, and undisrupted cells. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in disruption buffer. The protein content was determined (29Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Google Scholar), and aliquots were mixed with 2× Laemmli buffer supplemented with 50 mm DTT and boiled. The proteins (5–10 μg) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblot analysis was performed as described above, using anti-Rac1 mAb, anti-Rac2 antiserum, anti-p47phox, or anti-p67phox mAbs. To measure translocation of Rac proteins to the detergent-insoluble fraction, the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was resuspended in Laemmli buffer containing 50 mm DTT, and the samples were subjected to sonication. Aliquots were taken to estimate the protein content of each sample. Aliquots of proteins (20–40 μg) were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyscreen PVDF transfer membranes. The membranes were incubated with either anti-Rac1 mAb or anti-Rac2 antiserum and then with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgGs (1:10,000), as described above. β2Integrin-mediated Regulation of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases in PMNs—To engage β2 integrins on PMNs, the cells were incubated on a surface coated with fibrinogen (a ligand for β2 integrins) (30Yakubenko V.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Yee V.C. Plow E.F. Ugarova T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13995-14003Google Scholar) and exposed to TNF. Stimulation of PMNs with TNF or other cytokines such as leukotriene B4 increases the content of the CD11b/CD18 β2 integrin on the surface of PMNs (31Sengelov H. Kjeldsen L. Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Borregaard N. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1467-1476Google Scholar), and it is presumed that these β2 integrins exhibit augmented avidity for their ligands (32Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 619-624Google Scholar). In the present experiments, we measured the relative activities of Rac and Cdc42 in PMNs upon engagement of β2 integrins by using the GST-PAKcrib binding assay, which is based on the knowledge that the GST-PAKcrib fusion protein binds the GTP-bound forms of Cdc42 and Rac but does not bind GTP-bound RhoA (33Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar). We found that the amounts of Rac-GTP decreased in a time-dependent manner in PMNs adhering to immobilized fibrinogen in the presence of TNF, and we observed the lowest levels (2.5-fold decrease over controls) after incubation for 20–40 min on a fibrinogen-coated surface (Fig. 1A). PMNs express both Rac1 and Rac2, and the latter represents 95% of total Rac (34Heyworth P.G. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30749-30752Google Scholar); thus, the results presented in Fig. 1A definitely reflect decreased levels of Rac2-GTP. To corroborate this finding, and to ascertain whether regulation of Rac1 occurs in adherent PMNs, we conducted GST-PAKcrib pull-down assays followed by Western blot analysis using specific anti-Rac1 or anti-Rac2 antibodies. As expected, ligation of the β2 integrins on PMNs induced by exposure to immobilized fibrinogen caused a time-dependent decrease in the level of Rac2-GTP (Fig. 1C) and, with a similar time course, also lowered the amount of Rac1-GTP (Fig. 1B). In parallel experiments, we confirmed that engagement of β2 integrins on PMNs by plating them on fibrinogen in the presence of TNF led to a time-dependent activation of the respiratory burst as assessed by measuring the production of superoxide-induced formazan (Fig. 1D). In contrast to Rac, ligation of the β2 integrins led to a time-dependent activation of Cdc42, and we detected the maximum levels of Cdc42-GTP (2.5-fold increase over controls) in PMNs incubated on fibrinogen for 20–40 min (Fig. 2). However, stimulating suspended PMNs with TNF did not modify the basal activities of Cdc42, Rac1, or Rac2 (Fig. 3A), which confirms that TNF regulates only the activities of Cdc42 and Rac in adherent PMNs. This was further illustrated in our next set of experiments, in which PMNs were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C with anti-CD18 mAb (IB4) or an isotype-matched control antibody and then placed on a surface coated with fibrinogen and exposed to TNF. The relative activities of Cdc42 and Rac GTPases were subsequently measured using the GST-PAKcrib binding assay (see above). We found that preincubation with anti-CD18 antibody almost totally abolished adhesion-dependent regulation of Cdc42 and Rac activities (Fig. 3B), whereas pretreatment with an isotype-matched control antibody had no significant effect. These results agree well with a study by Nathan (2Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1550-1560Google Scholar) showing that TNF-mediated activation of the NADPH oxidase depended on adhesion to a surface and activation of the β2 integrins (2Nathan C.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1550-1560Google Scholar).Fig. 3TNF-induced regulation of Cdc42 and Rac GTPases in PMNs requires adhesion and activation of the β2 integrins.A, PMNs in suspension (106/ml) were stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times, after which the cells (20 × 106) were lysed. The blots show the amounts of active Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 determined by the GST-PAKcrib binding assay, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. The results of the GST pull-down assays are illustrated to the right. B, PMNs in suspension (10 × 106/ml) were preincubated with either an isotype-matched control antibody IgG2a (20 μg/ml) or the anti-β2 integrin antibody (anti-CD18, IB4; 20 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, the cells were incubated on a fibrinogen-coated surface and stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 30 min. The PMNs (20 × 106) were lysed, and the amounts of active GTP-bound Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2 were determined using the GST pull-down assay as described in the legend to Fig. 1. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further assess the validity of our GST-PAKcrib pull-down assay, we treated PMNs with fMLP (10–7m, 1 min) and found that this substance increased the activity of Cdc42 (196 ± 22% over controls; n = 4, p < 0.01), Rac1 (160 ± 21% over controls; n = 4, p < 0.05) and Rac2 (400 ± 106% over controls; n = 4, p < 0.05), which agrees with the results reported by other investigators (33Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13198-13204Google Scholar, 35Akasaki T. Hirofumi K. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Google Scholar, 36Geijsen N. van Delft S. Jan A.M Raaijmakers Lammers J-W.J. Collard J.G. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Blood. 1999; 94: 1121-1130Google Scholar). Thus, these findings show that the fMLP receptor and the β2 integrins collaborate in regulation of Cdc42 but oppose each other in the regulation of Rac GTPases. In control experiments, we observed that GST-PAKcrib, but not GST, could pull down Cdc42 and Rac GTPases (Fig. 3A), which rules out any nonspecific precipitation of the GTPases by the GST part of the fusion protein. Identification of the Signaling Pathways Involved in β2Integrin-induced Regulation of Rac and Cdc42 GTPases—To explore the difference in adhesion-dependent regulation of Rac and Cdc42, we pretreated PMNs with a variety of pharmacological agents and then incubated them on plates coated with fibrinogen in the presence of TNF. Thereafter, we used the GST-PAKcrib binding assay (described above) to measure the relative amounts of the active forms of Rac1, Rac2, and Cdc42. We pretreated the PMNs with the following agents: wortmanin or LY294002, both of which inhibit PI 3-kinase by distinct mechanisms and are known to block fMLP-induced generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and activation of the respiratory burst in PMNs (37Ding J. Vlahos C.J. Liu R. Brown R.F. Bradwey J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11684-11691Google Scholar), or PP1, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of Src family tyrosine kinases (38Hanke J.H. Garden J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PP1 (3 μm) blocks basal and β2 integrin-induced overall tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in PMNs (22Dib K. Melander F. Andersson T. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6311-6322Google Scholar). In our present study, pretreatment of PMNs with wortmanin or LY294002 significantly reduced, but did not totally block, adhesion-induced up-regulation of Cdc42 activity, and it partly reversed adhesion-elicited down-regulation of the activities of Rac1 and Rac2 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, pre-exposure to PP1 had no impact on activation of Cdc42 caused by ligation of the β2 integrins (Fig. 4, left panel), whereas it partly reverted adhesion-induced down-regulation of Rac1 (Fig. 4, middle panel) and Rac2 activities (Fig. 4, right panel). Ligation of β2Integrins Enhances the Activity of Rac-GAP—To further elucidate the mechanism by which ligation of PMNs β2 integrins leads to down-regulation of Rac activities, we performed experiments to determine whether increased Rac-GAP activity could induce this phenomenon in adherent PMNs. We incubated PMNs lysates for 5 min in the presence of semipurified Rac1 loaded with [γ-32P]GTP; in this assay, a decrease in γ-32P-labeled Rac1 indicates an increas"

These proteins share 1 or 2 partially conserved 200 amino acid segments of the a or the b type. The known biological activities of p202a include among others the regulation of muscle differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These biological activities of p202a can be correlated with the inhibition of the activity of several transcription factors. Thus, the binding of p202a results in the inhibition of the sequence-specific binding to DNA of the c-Fos, c-Jun, E2F1, E2F4, MyoD, myogenin, and c-Myc transcription factors. This study concerns the mechanisms by which p202a inhibits the activity of NF-κB, a transcription factor involved among others in host defense, inflammation, immunity, and the apoptotic response. NF-κB consists of p50 and p65 subunits. We demonstrate that p202a can inhibit in vitro and in vivo the binding to DNA of p65 homodimers and p50/65 heterodimers, whereas it increases the binding of p50 homodimers. Thus p202a can impair NF-κB activity both by inhibiting the binding to DNA of the transcriptionally active p65 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers and by boosting the binding of the repressive p50 homodimers. p202a can bind p50 and p65 in vitro and in vivo, and p202a can be part of the p50 homodimer complex bound to DNA. p50 binds in p202a to the a type segment, whereas p65 binds to the b type segment.

The 200 family proteins in mice (p202a, p202b, p204, and D3) and in humans (IFI16, MNDA, and AIM2) are encoded by the genes from the 200 family (2Lengyel P. Choubey D. Li S.-J. Datta B. Semin.

Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of p202a can be overcome by the binding of p202a to the p53 binding protein 1 (18Datta B. Li B. Choubey D. Nallur G. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27544-27555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). p202a binds the human adenovirus E1A oncoprotein and reduces E1A-mediated apoptosis (20Xin H. D'Souza S. Fang L. Lengyel P. Choubey D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6828-6839Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). E1A in turn can partially overcome the inhibition of cell proliferation by p202a. Lowering the concentration of serum in the medium results in the increase in the level of p202a in fibroblasts (21Geng Y. D'Souza S. Xin H. Walter S. Choubey D. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 475-483PubMed Google Scholar). p202a is also induced during skeletal muscle differentiation in consequence of transactivation of the Ifi202a gene by the muscle-specific MyoD transcription factor (16Datta B. Min W. Burma S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Wang H. Ding B. Liu C.J. Ma X.Y. Deschamps S. Roe B.A. Lengyel P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 729-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). p202a can modulate during this process the activity of the muscle-specific transcription factors MyoD and myogenin, and it also inhibits apoptosis (16Datta B. Min W. Burma S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 17Wang H. Liu C. Lu Y. Chatterjee G. Ma X.Y. Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of 202a RNA and p202a are increased in NIH 3T3 cells by the H-ras oncogene (23Xin H. Geng Y. Pramanik R. Choubey D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This is apparently in consequence of the activation by the H-Ras oncoprotein of the transcription factor c-Jun, which binds to two AP-1 DNA binding sites in the Ifi202a gene encoding p202a. It was proposed that the increased expression of p202a in the cells transfected with the activated H-ras expression plasmid increases the survival of the cells in low serum conditions (23Xin H. Geng Y. Pramanik R. Choubey D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 88: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). p202a has a sister protein, p202b, which is encoded by the Ifi202b gene and differs from p202a only in 7 of 445 amino acids (1Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The disruption of the Ifi202a gene in mice has no obvious phenotype, apparently in consequence of the increase of the p202b level, compensating for the loss of p202a. Overexpression of p202 (which of the two types remains to be identified) was linked in mice to susceptibility to the autoimmune disease lupus erythematosus (24Rozzo S.J. Allard J.D. Choubey D. Vyse T.J. Izui S. Peltz G. Kotzin B.L. Immunity. 2001; 15: 435-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The binding of p202a to transcription factors blocks transactivation in most cases (e.g. c-Fos, c-Jun, E2F1, E2F4, MyoD, and myogenin) by inhibiting their sequence-specific binding to DNA (13Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Choubey D. Li S.J. Datta B. Gutterman J.U. Lengyel P.

Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1074-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, c-Myc-dependent transactivation is blocked by p202a in consequence of the inhibition of the binding of c-Myc to Max (17Wang H. Liu C. Lu Y. Chatterjee G. Ma X.Y. Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We have reported earlier that p202a also binds and inhibits the activity of the transcription factor NF-κB (13Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). NF-κB activates numerous genes involved in host defense, inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, and tumor development (25Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 46: 705-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1913) Google Scholar, 26Sen R. Baltimore D. Cell. 1986; 47: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar, 27Ghosh S.

Cell. 2002; 111: 615-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a member of the NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family. In mammals, this consists of p65 (RelA), RelB, c-Rel, p105/p50 (NF-κB1), and p105/p52 (NF-κB2). All family members share a partially conserved domain of 300 amino acids, the Rel homology domain. This is required for dimerization, and the members form various homo- and heterodimers and exert their activities in the form of dimers. p65, RelB, and c-Rel contain potent transactivation domains. In contrast, the mature p50 and p52 proteins lack strong activation domains, and the p50 and p52 homodimers were shown to act as repressors (27Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev.

However, there are several reports suggesting that in certain cases p50 homodimers can transactivate gene expression in vitro (38Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 775-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and in vivo, especially after interaction with particular nuclear proteins (39Fujita T. Nolan G.P. Liou H.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1354-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 40Dechend R. Hirano F. Lehmann K. Heissmeyer V. Ansieau S. Wulczyn F.G. Scheidereit C. Leutz A.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 4592-4597Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The p50/p65 complex (usually designated as NF-κB) is the most abundant of the NF-κB/Rel family heterodimers (27Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). It is present in essentially all cells.The NF-κB proteins can be retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form as a consequence of binding to proteins of the IκB family (IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBϵ) (27Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar). (For a discussion of the possibility that NF-κB·IκB complexes might shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, see Ref. 31Dixit V. Mak T.W. Cell. 2002; 111: 615-619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar.) The activation of NF-κB and its movement to the nucleus occurs following the proteolytic degradation of the IκB proteins. The degradation of these is triggered by phosphorylation, mediated by the IKK (inhibitor of IκB kinase) complex together with the regulatory protein NEMO (43Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4045) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation leads to polyubiquitination and degradation of IκB by the proteasomes. The phosphorylation also activates PKAc, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, the cyclic AMP activatable protein kinase, which can phosphorylate and activate the NF-κB p65 subunit (44Zhong H. SuYang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1997; 89: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Activators of the NF-κB family of transcription factors include a large variety of agents (e.g. double-stranded RNA, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, phorbol esters, cytokines (e.g. TNF 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acids; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. 1The abbreviations used are: TNF, tumor necrosis factor; DTT, dithiothreitol; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; GST, glutathione S-transferase; aa, amino acids; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling. and interleukin-1), UV light, and viruses (27Ghosh S.

Cell. 2002; 10: 693-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB can associate in the nucleus with a DNA binding motif with the consensus sequence 5′-GGGRNNYYCC-3′ (27Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4572) Google Scholar, 28May M.J. Ghosh S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar).The interferon-inducible p202a protein was found earlier to bind to the p50 and p65 subunits of the NF-κB transcription factor and to inhibit NF-κB-dependent transcription of reporter constructs and endogenous genes in various cultured cell lines (13Min W. Ghosh S. Lengyel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Here we report observations that help to elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition: (a) p202a inhibits the rate and extent of the sequence-specific binding to DNA of in vitro synthesized murine p65 homodimers and p50/p65 heterodimers, whereas it increases the binding of p50 homodimers; (b) p202a added to nuclear extracts also decreases the binding to DNA of native p50/p65 heterodimers, whereas it increases the binding of p50 homodimers; and (c) overexpression of ectopic p202a in transfected AKR-2B cells also inhibits the binding to DNA of endogenous p50/p65 heterodimers while increasing the binding of p50/p50 homodimers. Consequently, p202a might diminish the transcriptional activity of NF-κB in two ways: (a) by inhibiting the binding to DNA of the transcriptionally active p50/p65 heterodimers and p65 homodimers and (b) by boosting the binding of the transcriptionally inactive p50 homodimers. Antisera to p50 or p65 coimmunoprecipitated p202a, and antiserum to p202a coimmunoprecipitated p50 and p65 from the cell extracts, revealing an interaction between these proteins in vivo. An antiserum to p202a supershifted the p50 complex in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, but only when p202a was present, suggesting that p202a can be part of the p50 complex bound to DNA. This conclusion was in agreement with the finding that p202a was retained by p50 bound to an NF-κB oligodeoxynucleotide coupled to beads. The NF-κB subunits bound to distinct segments in p202a: p50 to the a segment and p65 to the b segment. Whereas, in the binding to p202a only one short region of p65 close to the C terminus was required, several regions of p50 were involved. In accord with an earlier report (46Wen Y. Yan D.H. Spohn B. Deng J. Lin S.Y. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 42-46PubMed Google Scholar), transfected ectopic p202a increased the apoptotic effect of tumor necrosis factor on NIH 3T3 cells, presumably by suppressing the antiapoptotic effect of NF-κB.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAntibodiesAnti-p65 (SC-7175) and anti-p50 (H-119) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-GST (G1160) was from Sigma. The preparation of purified anti-p202a was as described (12Choubey D. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6134-6140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The purified anti-p202 antibodies can recognize in Western blotting and immunoprecipitate both p202a and p202b (1Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar).InterferonsHuman interferon α2/α1-(1–83) active in murine cells was obtained from H. Weber and C. Weissmann (47Weber H. Weissmann C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 591-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).ReagentsPurified p50 protein (rhNF-κB, p50 E3770), the TNT-coupled reticulocyte lysate system, and the 22-mer NF-κB-specific RRBE oligodeoxynucleotide were from Promega. The biotin-labeling reagent was from Roche Applied Science.Cell LinesEL4 (mouse T) cells (ATCC TIB181) were grown in suspension in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic agents (Invitrogen). AKR-2B (cloned murine embryo) cells (from H. Moses, Vanderbilt University (48Getz M.J. Elder P.K. Benz Jr., E.W. Stephens R.E. Moses H.L. Cell. 1976; 7: 255-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) were grown in monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic agents (complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). All cells were cultured in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. 293 (human embryonic kidney) cells (ATCC/CRL-1573) were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 1% antibiotic and antimycotic agents. HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells (ATCC/CCL-2) were grown in the same medium as 293 cells except that as serum 10% fetal bovine serum was used.Construction of the ov1, ov2, and ov3 Cell Lines Overexpressing p202AKR-2B cells grown to 60% confluence were transfected with a p202a expression plasmid (pcDNA3-p202a) or with the vector (pcDNA3 serving as control) using LipofectAMINE according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). 48 h after transfection the cells were split 1:5 into selection medium containing G418 (500 μg/ml). After a 10–14-day incubation, G418-resistant colonies were picked. Three of these colonies (ov1, ov2, and ov3) were amplified, and their p202 levels were compared with that of the control AKR-2B line by immunoblotting. The p202a levels in the overexpressing lines were also compared with the levels of p202a induced by treatment of control AKR-2B cells with 1000 units/ml interferon for various lengths of time. The levels of p202a as well as of NF-κB p50 and p65 were determined in 10-μg protein samples from the culture lysates. As an internal control, the levels of β-actin were also determined.Fusion Proteins and Deletion MutantsThe preparation of GST-p50 was reported (49Ghosh S. Gifford A.M. Riviere L.R. Tempst P. Nolan G.P. Baltimore D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1019-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). His-tagged p65 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by affinity chromatography (50Muller K.M. Arndt K.M. Bauer K. Pluckthun A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The construction of expression plasmids encoding GST-p202a and its truncated fusion proteins were reported earlier (17Wang H. Liu C. Lu Y. Chatterjee G. Ma X.Y. Eisenman R.N. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27377-27385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins expressed in E. coli were purified using glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and Sephadex G50 columns. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Supershift AssaysDouble-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide probes were labeled using [γ-32P]dATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on Micro-SpinG-25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). The reaction mixtures (20 μl) included 40 fmol of oligodeoxynucleotide probe, 200 ng of protein expressed in vitro, or 10 μg of nuclear extract protein in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2–1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol. Incubations were at room temperature for the times indicated. Unlabeled double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide (in 10-fold excess over the probe) was added, if so indicated, 10 min prior to adding the labeled probe. Supershift assays involved the incubation of reaction mixtures including nuclear extract with 2 μl of antibodies, at 4 °C overnight, before adding the labeled probe. Samples were loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer (0.045 m Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA) and electrophoresed at 300 V for 2 h. The separated DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. If so indicated, the signal strength was determined by densitometry. The average signal intensity and S.D. values were determined based on the results of three independent experiments. Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (51Beg A.A. Finco T.S. Nantermet P.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3301-3310Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped into 500 μl of PBS buffer, and spun down, and the pellet was resuspended in 3 packed cell volumes of Triton lysis buffer (9 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Triton X-100 (the concentration of Triton X-100 was 0.3% for HeLa and AKR2B cells and 0.2% for EL4 and 293 cells)). After 5 min on ice, the lysates were sedimented by centrifugation. The pelleted nuclei were washed, and nuclear proteins were extracted with 2 packed cell volumes of nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 8.0), 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol) at 4 °C for 45 min. The soluble material was pelleted, and the supernatant fraction was dialyzed at 4 °C for 1 h against Shapiro's buffer D (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.7 mg pepstatin A per liter and 0.5 mg/liter leupeptin) (52Shapiro D.J. Sharp P.A. Wahli W.W. Keller M.J. DNA. 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant fraction was stored at –80 °C (nuclear extract).Immunoprecipitation and ImmunoblottingImmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described (53Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). The antibody α-p202, α-p65, α-p50, or preserum was coupled to Gel10 beads (Sigma) by mixing antibody and Gel10 beads in a 1:1 ratio, incubated at 4 °C with rotation for 4 h, sedimented, washed with 0.1× MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) four times, and resuspended in 1× immunoprecipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mg/liter leupeptin). The beads were then added to cell extracts, incubated with rotation at 4 °C and 1 h, and washed five times with 1× immunoprecipitation buffer. The proteins were eluted from the beads with 1× SDS sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, and visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).It should be noted that extracts from various murine cells and tissues were reported earlier to contain mRNAs for both p202a and p202b. The ratios of these two mRNAs varied with their sources. Furthermore, treatment with interferons increased the levels of both 202a and 202b mRNAs (1Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An antiserum raised against p202a recognized and immunoprecipitated both p202a and p202b, which differ only in 7 of 445 amino acids (1Wang H. Chatterjee G. Meyer J.J. Liu C.J. Manjunath N.A. Bray-Ward P. Lengyel P. Genomics. 1999; 60: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, we could not determine the proportions of p202a and p202b immunocoprecipitated from cell extracts. Therefore, we have continued to designate as p202a coprecipitates that contained both p202a and p202b. This is the case, for example, in Fig. 4, A and B.GST Pull-down AssayCovalent Coupling o"

FucT in H. pylori strain NCTC11639 has an exclusive α1,3 activity because it recognizes only Type II substrates, whereas FucT in H. pylori strain UA948 can utilize both Type II and Type I acceptors; thus it has both α1,3 and α1,4 activity, respectively. To identify elements conferring substrate specificity, 12 chimeric FucTs were constructed by domain swapping between 11639FucT and UA948FucT and characterized for their ability to transfer fucose to Type I and Type II acceptors. Our results indicate that the C-terminal region of H. pylori FucTs controls Type I and Type II acceptor specificity. In particular, the highly divergent C-terminal portion, seven amino acids DNPFIFC at positions 347–353 in 11639FucT, and the corresponding 10 amino acids CNDAHYSALH at positions 345–354 in UA948FucT, controls the Type I and Type II acceptor recognition. This is the opposite of mammalian FucTs where acceptor preference is determined primarily by the N-terminal residues in the hypervariable stem domain. The α1,3/4 fucosyltransferase (FucT) enzyme from Helicobacter pylori catalyzes fucose transfer from donor GDP-β-l-fucose to the GlcNAc group of two series of acceptor substrates in H. pylori lipopolysaccharide: βGal1,3βGlcNAc (Type I) or βGal1,4βGlcNAc (Type II). Fucose is added either in α1,3 linkage of Type II acceptor to produce Lewis X or in α1,4 linkage of Type I acceptor to produce Lewis A, respectively.

This is the opposite of mammalian FucTs where acceptor preference is determined primarily by the N-terminal residues in the hypervariable stem domain. The lipopolysaccharide of Helicobacter pylori contains fucosylated oligosaccharides, predominantly the Type II blood group antigens Lewis X and Lewis Y (1Wirth H.P. Yang M. Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some H. pylori strains also express the Type I blood group antigens Lewis A and Lewis B (2Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H. Rasko D.A.

H. pylori fucosyltransferases (FucTs) 1The abbreviations used are: FucT, fucosyltransferase; Type I, Galβ1,3GlcNAc; Type II, Galβ1,4GlcNAc; Type I-R, Galβ1,3GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3; Type II-R, Galβ1,4GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3; WT, wild type. are the enzymes responsible for the last steps in the synthesis of Lewis antigens. Difucosylated Lewis antigens (Lewis Y and Lewis B) can be synthesized via two pathways: terminal fucosylation (in α1,2 linkage) followed by subterminal fucosylation (in α1,3 or α1,4 linkage) or subterminal fucosylation followed by terminal fucosylation. Unlike mammalian cells, the latter pathway is predominately used in H. pylori (3Wang G. Ge Z. Rasko D.A. Taylor D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).

Taylor D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These three fut genes do not always encode functional proteins. For instance, the futA gene, but not the futB gene, encodes an active α1,3/4 FucT in H. pylori strains NCTC11639 and UA948 (7Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The on/off status of fut genes and the various levels of FucT activities exhibited in different H. pylori strains determine the Lewis antigen expression patterns of H. pylori lipopolysaccharide. FucTs are inverting enzymes and belong to glycosyltransferase family 10 (9Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). They are widely expressed in vertebrates, invertebrates, and bacteria. Mammalian α1,3/4 FucTs are Golgi-anchored proteins with short cytoplasmic N-terminal tails, transmembrane segments, hypervariable stem domains, and C-terminal catalytic domains. The C-terminal catalytic domain of mammalian FucT displays a low level of amino acid sequence identity (40%) with the internal catalytic domain of H. pylori FucTs (8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This domain contains two highly conserved regions, referred to as the α1,3/4 FucT motifs (10Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: vii-xiiCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In comparison with mammalian FucTs, H. pylori FucTs do not have N-terminal tails or transmembrane domains; instead, they contain heptad repeats at their C terminus, which are absent in human FucTs (8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 11Breton C. Oriol R. Imberty A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). α1,3/4 FucTs exhibit distinct acceptor preferences. For instance, despite the fact that human FucT III, V, and VI and bovine FucT share at least 70% protein sequence identity (12Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J. Lowe J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24575-24584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Oulmouden A. Wierinckx A. Petit J.M. Costache M. Palcic M.M. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Julien R. J. Biol.

FucT VI and bovine FucT display exclusive α1,3 activity; in contrast, FucT III and V show both α1,3 and α1,4 activity, although they exhibit different preferences toward Type I and Type II substrates. FucT III favors Type I acceptors and therefore is predominantly an α1,4 FucT, whereas FucT V prefers Type II acceptors and hence is primarily an α1,3 FucT (Refs. 12Weston B.W. Smith P.L. Kelly R.J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8818-8823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N-terminal hypervariable stem region in human FucTs is responsible for conferring acceptor specificity. In particular, site-directed mutagenesis data showed that the substitution of as few as two amino acids (His87-Ile88 in FucT III corresponding to Asn86-Thr87 in FucT V) (17Nguyen A.T. Holmes E.H.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) is able to change the Type I or Type II substrate specificity. The adjacent residue Asp112 in FucT V, corresponding to Glu116 in bovine FucT, was able to further modulate the relative Type I and Type II acceptor specificity (18Dupuy F. Petit J.M. Mollicone R. Oriol R. Julien R. Maftah A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12257-12262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because there is no sequence identity at the N terminus between human FucTs and H. pylori FucTs (8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), no domain or amino acid residues in H. pylori FucTs correspond to the region or residues conferring Type I and Type II substrate specificity in human FucTs could be identified. The main goal of this study was to identify the determinants of H. pylori FucTs responsible for discriminating acceptor substrate preference. Characterization of structure-function relationships of H. pylori FucTs would enable us to manipulate the Lewis antigen expression pattern by mutation of FucT genes. This could lead to a clearer understanding of the role of Lewis antigen in persistent H. pylori infection. In addition, H. pylori FucTs are promising candidates for chemoenzymatic glycoconjugate synthesis (19Meldal M. St. Hilaire P.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Ernst B. Oehrlein R. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Johnson K.F. Glycoconj. J. 1999; 16: 141-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Finally, better understanding of the bacterial FucTs could help us understand the divergent evolution of various lineages in the FucT kingdom. Materials—The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen. pGEM-T vector was obtained from Promega Co. (Madison, WI). Type II-R (βGal1–4βGlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3) and Type I-R (βGal1–3βGlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3) were kindly provided by Dr. O. Hindsgaul. Anti-penta-histidine monoclonal antibody was purchased from Qiagen. GDP-fucose and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma. [3H]GDP-fucose (0.1 mCi ml–1, 17.3 Ci mmol–1) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce. Nitrocellulose membrane was obtained from Micron Separation Inc. (Westboro, MA). The ECL kit was supplied by Amersham Biosciences. BioMax MR film was obtained from Eastman Kodak Co. (Rochester, NY). Cloning of Chimeric FucTs—H. pylori strains NCTC11639 and UA948 were cultured by standard methods, as described by Taylor et al. (22Taylor D.E. Hargreaves J.A. Ng L.K. Sherbaniuk R.W. Jewell L.D. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1987; 87: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Chromosomal DNA was isolated following standard protocol (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). Two primers BM11 and BM12 were designed to amply the futA gene. The domain swapping experiments were accomplished by primer overlap extension with two steps of sequential PCR (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar). The sequences of primers are available in the supplemental data. Two pairs of proximal primers were used in the second step of PCR: BM91 and BM77, complementary to futA in strain 11639; and BM101 and BM87, complementary to futA in strain UA948. A Shine-Dalgarno sequence was included at the sense primers BM91 and BM101. The codons for six histidine residues were included in the antisense primers BM77 and BM87. The PCR products were cloned into A/T cloning vector pGEM-T under the control of a T7 promoter. Cloned chimeric futA genes were sequenced to assure that no mutation had occurred during their construction. Induction and Expression of H. pylori FucT Genes—Expression of FucT genes were induced as described previously (7Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

Escherichia coli HMS174DE3 cells were used for FucT expression, and DE3 carries the gene encoding T7 RNA polymerase under the control of an isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-induced lactose promoter. The cells were grown at 30 °C with vigorous shaking (200 rpm min–1) in SOC medium (20% tryptone, 5% yeast extract, 0.05% (w/v) NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm KCl, 20 mm glucose) (23Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000Google Scholar) including ampicillin (100 μg ml–1) and rifampicin (200 μg ml–1) for 2 h until the A600 reached ∼0.3, at which point 1 mm of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. After 4 h, the cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in HEPES buffer (20 mm, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride), and the cells were lysed using three freeze-thaw cycles (24Wang G. Rahman M.S. Humayun M.Z. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9486-9492Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The cells were treated with lysozome (200 μg ml–1) and DNase (125 units ml–1) for 20 min on ice after the first freeze-thaw process. The total protein concentrations of the crude cell extracts were determined using the BCA protein assay kit, with bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the supplier's instructions. The crude cell lysates (isolated membrane fractions) were used for the enzyme assays, enzyme kinetics determination, and immunoblot analysis. Fucosyltransferase Assay—FucT assays were performed as described previously (7Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21357-21363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 4: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A protein preparation from HMS174DE3 E. coli cells containing the pGEM vector was used as a negative control. The α1,3 and α1,4 FucT activities of wild type (WT) and chimeric FucTs were assayed with Type II-R at 1.8 mm or Type I-R at 7.5 mm and GDP-fucose at 200 μm. [3H]GDP-fucose (∼60,000 dpm) was included in each reaction. One milliunit represents the amount of enzyme that converts 1 nmol of acceptor substrates to the product per min. The specific activity (milliunit mg–1) was obtained by dividing the enzyme activity (milliunit) by total protein concentration. Specific enzyme activity below 0.01 milliunit mg–1 was considered undetectable. Immunoblot Analysis of Native and Chimeric FucT Expression— Crude cell extracts were boiled for 5 min in 4% (w/v) SDS and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The cell extracts containing equal amounts of total protein (7.35 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were electrically transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (pore size, 0.22 μm). The nitrocellulose blots were probed with primary antibody (mouse anti-penta-histidine monoclonal antibody) at 1:1000 dilution and secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat antimouse IgG) at 1:2000 dilution. The blots were developed using an ECL kit, and the images were visualized on BioMax MR films. The FucT band densities were determined and quantified using Alpha Ease FC software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, San Leandro, CA). A standard curve with six points quantifying FucT band densities was performed using WT UA948FucT sample containing total protein between 1.84 and 18.4 μg. For WT and chimeric FucT samples, 7.35 μg of total protein was loaded for immunoblot analysis, which was in the middle of the linear range (data not shown). The expression level of UA948FucT was set to 1, and the expression levels of 11639FucT and chimeric FucTs were obtained relative to that of UA948FucT. The enzyme activity of mutants was normalized by dividing the specific activity (milliunit mg–1) by the expression level of the chimeric FucT. Determination of Kinetic Parameters—Acceptor kinetics were determined using 0.03–2 mm Type II-R or 0.4–25 mm Type I-R with GDP-fucose at 200 μm including [3H]GDP-fucose. 2 mm of Type II-R is the highest concentration that can be reached in the current study because of its low solubility. Because of the limited supply of the acceptors, donor kinetics were determined using 3–200 μm GDP-fucose with Type II-R at 2 mm or Type I-R at 15 mm including [3H]GDP-fucose. The kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting the initial rate data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using nonlinear regression analysis with Prism 2.0 software (GraphPad Software, Inc. San Diego, CA). Sequence Alignment of H. pylori FucTs—Seven FucT sequences from five different H. pylori strains, 11639, UA948, 11637, 26695, and J99 (Fig. 1), were aligned using ClustalW (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) with LaserGene99 software (DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI). UA948FucT displays both α1,3 and α1,4 activities and like human FucT V, it favors Type II over Type I acceptors (8Rasko D.A. Wang G. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4988-4994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). 11639FucT as well as 11637FucTb have exclusive α1,3 activity (7Ge Z. Chan N.W. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E.

There is no experimental data available for enzyme activity and specificity of 26695FucTa, 26695FucTb, J99FucTa, and J99FucTb. Because H. pylori strain 26695 and J99 lipopolysaccharide express Lewis X and Lewis Y (28Appelmelk B.J. Martin S.L. Monteiro M.A. Clayton C.A. McColm A.A. Zheng P. Verboom T. Maaskant J.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Hokke C.H. Perry M.B. Vandenbroucke-Grauls C.M. Kusters J.G. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 5361-5366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but not Lewis A and Lewis B structures, α1,3/4 FucTs in 26695 and J99 are expected to have α1,3 activity only. Whether or not the active FucT protein is encoded by the futA gene, the futB gene, or both remains to be determined. Three regions of low sequence identity are evident in the alignment of seven H. pylori FucTs (displayed in boxed areas in Fig. 1). The first divergent region is located at the N terminus between residues 13 and 41 (11639FucT numbering). The second region resides immediately upstream of the heptad repeats, with most of the divergence caused by the unique sequences in UA948FucT and 26695FucTa. The third divergent region contains the C-terminal heptad repeats. There are between two and 10 heptad repeats with a conserved D(D/N)LR(V/I)NY sequence in all of the listed FucTs except for UA948FucT (Fig. 1). UA948FucT contains five internal repeats with this consensus sequence, whereas the first and the last two heptad repeats contain the amino acid sequence DDLRRDH. Expression of Native and Chimeric FucTs—The expected molecular masses of 11639FucT and UA948FucT are 56.0 and 54.6, kDa, respectively, and both proteins migrate to the expected locations on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2). The chimeric FucTs were expressed at similar levels as WT FucTs in HMS174DE3 cells (Fig. 2), indicating that the domain swapping did not cause significant changes in FucT enzyme expression levels. Kinetic Parameters of WT FucTs with or without His6Tag— Kinetic parameters for both WT and His6-tagged WT FucTs are shown in Table I. The Km for Type II acceptor of 11639FucT is 0.37 mm, 4-fold lower than that of UA948FucT. UA948FucT had a 7-fold lower Km for Type II than Type I. 11639FucT and UA948FucT have similar donor Km values with Type II acceptor. UA948FucT had a slightly lower donor Km when Type I was used as an acceptor. Acceptor and donor Km values were not affected by the addition of a His6 tag, except that UA948FucT with a His6 tag had a slightly higher Km for Type I acceptor.Table IThe acceptor and donor kinetic parameters of wild type 11639FucT and UA948FucT with or without the C-terminal His6 tagFucT constructsKmKm of GDP-fucoseType II-RaGalβ1,4GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.Type I-RbGalβ1,3GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.With Type II-RaGalβ1,4GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.With Type I-RbGalβ1,3GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.mMμM116390.31 ± 0.06NAcNot applicable.48.0 ± 8.6NAcNot applicable.11639-C-His60.37 ± 0.03NAcNot applicable.44.7 ± 5.5NAcNot applicable.UA9481.2 ± 0.28.4 ± 1.168.3 ± 8.335.7 ± 7.9UA948-C-His61.5 ± 0.213.4 ± 1.456.0 ± 10.133.7 ± 7.8a Galβ1,4GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.b Galβ1,3GlcNAc-O(CH2)8CO2CH3.c Not applicable. Open table in a new tab Enzyme Activity and Substrate Specificity of Chimeric FucTs—Twelve chimeric FucTs (Fig 3A) containing peptide fragments from two parental FucTs were constructed. The exchange of the three highly divergent segments (boxed areas in Fig. 1) between two parental FucTs was the major focus of domain swapping. In addition, the exchange of comparatively conserved internal regions containing two α1,3 motifs was also included. The normalized α1,3 and α1,4 activities (milliunit mg–1) according to the FucT protein expression level of WT and chimeric FucTs are given in Fig. 3B. In addition, the α1,4/α1,3 activity ratio (%) was calculated (Fig. 3B). The α1,3 activity of 11639FucT was 16.3 milliunit mg–1, which is lower than that of UA948FucT (23.8 milliunit mg–1). The α1,4 activity of UA948FucT was one-third of its α1,3 activity. Constructs 116391–110UA948111–462, 116391–158UA948157–462, and 116391–296UA948295–462 containing the 11639FucT N terminus and the UA948FucT C terminus had both α1,3 and α1,4 FucT activities. In contrast, their counterparts, constructs UA9481–11011639111–478, UA9481–15611639159–478, and UA9481–29411639297–478, containing the UA948FucT N terminus and the 11639FucT C terminus, displayed α1,3 activity with little or no α1,4 activity. Therefore, it is the C terminus that controls Type I or Type II acceptor specificity in H. pylori FucTs. This is different from human FucTs, where the N-terminal hypervariable stem domain determines acceptor specificity. UA9481–15611639159–478 and UA9481–29411639297–478 exhibited very low α1,3 FucT activity, although they were stably expressed (Fig. 2). Apparently the two segments of the chimeras are not fully compatible in these cases, which results in the low enzyme activity. Mutant 116391–359UA948361–462 displayed α1,3 activity at WT level without gaining α1,4 activity, indicating that the C-terminal heptad repeats of UA948FucT cannot confer Type I acceptor specificity. This is further supported by the substitution of heptad repeats of UA948FucT by those of 11639FucT (construct UA9481–36011639360–478), which failed to abolish the α1,4 activity. However, although chimera UA9481–36011639360–478 exhibited a nearly WT UA948FucT α1,4/α1,3 activity ratio (24% versus 31%), both its α1,3 and α1,4 activities were low. Apparently, the heptad repeats of 11639FucT have a negative impact on catalysis by the UA948 catalytic domain, affecting α1,3 and α1,4 activities to a similar extent. In contrast, the 11639FucT catalytic domain can tolerate the exchange of heptad repeats by those of UA948 FucT. Mosaic construct 116391–110UA948111–29411639297–478 had normal α1,3 activity but no α1,4 activity, demonstrating that the internal region (110–294) of UA948FucT was unable to confer α1,4 activity either. In contrast, construct 116391–158UA948157–36011639360–478 exhibited both α1,3 and α1,4 activity, although both at low levels. Comparing all 10 chimeras it becomes obvious that those containing residues 295–361 of UA948FucT have α1,4 activity, whereas all without it lack α1,4 activity. Therefore, it is likely that residues in this segment confer α1,4 activity. The segment (295–361) includes the second divergent region. Remarkably, chimera 11639347CNDAHYSALH gained 11% of WT UA948FucT α1,4 activity. In contrast, its counterpart UA948345DNPFIFC lost almost all of its α1,4 activity without losing its α1,3 activity. This suggests that the second divergent region determines the absence or presence of α1,4 activity. Our data indicate that residues 345CNDAHYSALH354 of UA948FucT are essential for conferring Type I substrate specificity. It should be noted that 11639347CNDAHYNALH gained relatively low α1,4 activity and that its α1,4/α1,3 ratio is also lower than that of WT UA948FucT (Fig. 3B), suggesting that some other residues may further contribute to acceptor substrate specificity. UA9481–36011639360–478, but not 116391–296UA948295–462, has a near WT α1,4/α1,3 ratio, suggesting that additional acceptor specificity determinants are located at the N terminus, prior to residue 296. Chimera 116391–110UA948111–462 displays a 2-fold drop in α1,4/α1,3 ratio that does not deteriorate further in the 116391–158UA948157–462 construct. This suggests that the additional acceptor specificity determinants reside in the N-terminal 110 residues. However, at this moment we do not yet want to rule out a role for residues 158–296 because chimera 116391–158UA948157–462 has a noticeably higher α1,4/α1,3 ratio than chimera 116391–296UA948295–462. Our data indicate that the second divergent region is crucial for α1,4 activity, but more detailed studies will be needed to delineate the additional acceptor determinants more precisely. Kinetics Parameters of Mutants—The kinetic parameters of two WT FucTs and constructs 116391–359UA948361–462, UA9481–36011639360–478, 11639347CNDAHYNALH, and UA948345DNPFIFC are shown in Table II.

We have examined the role of specific phospholipids in the interaction of these proteins with native osmotically intact disk vesicles, employing spin-labeled phospholipid analogues (2% of total phospholipids) and bovine serum albumin back-exchange assay. Inactive GDP-bound transducin exclusively reduced the extraction of negatively charged phosphatidylserine. The effect disappeared upon activation of the G-protein with guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPγS). PDE affected the extraction of the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and, to a smaller extent, of phosphatidylethanolamine. When active GtGTPγS interacted with the PDE to form the active effector, the interaction with phosphatidylcholine was specifically enhanced. Each copy of the G-protein bound 3 ± 1 molecules of phosphatidylserine, whereas the PDE bound a much larger amount (70 ± 10) of a mixture of phosphatidylcholine and ethanolamine. The results are interpreted as a head group-specific and state-dependent interaction of the signaling proteins with the phospholipids of the photoreceptor membrane.

The results are interpreted as a head group-specific and state-dependent interaction of the signaling proteins with the phospholipids of the photoreceptor membrane. The transduction of the light signal in the retinal rod photoreceptor is a well studied model system for G-protein-coupled signal transduction. It involves the sequential activation of rhodopsin, transducin (Gt), 1The abbreviations used are: Gt, transducin; BSA, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin; BTP, 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-propane buffer; Gtα, α-subunit of transducin; Gtβγ, βγ heterodimer subunit of transducin; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) bound; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PS, phosphatidylserine; PDE, cGMP-phosphodiesterase; ROS, rod outer segment; SL-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxylpentanoyl) phosphatidylcholine; SL-PE, 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxylpentanoyl) phosphatidylethanolamine; SL-PS, 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxylpentanoyl) phosphatidylserine; SL-PL, spin-labeled phospholipids. and cGMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) on the cytoplasmic surface of the disk saccules that fill the rod outer segment (ROS). Absorption of light transforms rhodopsin into the activated metarhodopsin II state, which then interacts with Gt to rapidly catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP in the nucleotide-binding site of the Gtα-subunit. Gtα-GTP dissociates and couples to the effector PDE (1Fung K.K.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 2500-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 2Fung B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Activation of PDE results in a decrease in the cytosolic cGMP concentration which in turn leads to closure of cGMP-regulated channels in the plasma membrane, hyperpolarization, and neuronal signaling (see Ref. 3Helmreich E.J. Hofmann K.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 285-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Heterotrimeric Gt is peripherally attached to the disk membrane by weak hydrophobic and ionic interactions. Both N-terminal acylation of the Gtα-subunit and C-terminal farnesylation of the Gtγ-subunit are required for membrane association of Gt (4Bigay J. Faurobert E. Franco M. Chabre M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14081-14090Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Electrostatic interactions, especially of Gtβγ, further enhance the membrane binding to negatively charged surfaces or to vesicles containing the acidic lipid phosphatidylserine (5Matsuda T. Takao T.

Gt couples to activated rhodopsin, triggering GDP release as a first step of catalytic nucleotide exchange. The interaction with the receptor occurs directly from the membrane-bound state of the holoprotein. After activation of transducin, Gtα dissociates from Gtβγ and couples stoichiometrically to the effector PDE. The PDE is a heterotetrameric protein composed of the undissociable αβ complex (8Artemyev N.O. Surendran R. Lee J.C. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25382-25388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and two identical γ-subunits (9Fung B.K. Young J.H. Yamane H.K. Griswold Prenner I. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2657-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Full activation of the enzyme requires the binding of activated (GTP bound) Gt to both of its inhibitory γ-subunits (see Ref. 10Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 449: 719-758Crossref Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Like Gt, the PDE complex is weakly associated to the surface of the disk membrane by geranylgeranylation of PDE-β and farnesylation of PDE-α (11Catty P. Deterre P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Anant J.S. Ong O.C. Xie H.Y. Clarke S. O'Brien P.J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 687-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The geranylgeranyl moiety was mainly made responsible for membrane attachment, whereas the farnesyl group may play a role in protein-protein interactions. It is known that efficient activation of PDE by active GtαGTP requires the presence of membranes, and protein-membrane interactions co-determine the interaction of Gtα-GTP with the PDE (13Hofmann K.P. Heck M. Lee A.G. Biomembranes II. JAI Press Inc., Greenwich, CT1996: 142-184Google Scholar). PDE activation studies on vesicles of different lipid composition showed that the activity of PDE depended on the nature of the lipid. The highest PDE activation was found on large unilamellar vesicles composed of the unsaturated phospholipid dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (14Melia T.J. Malinski J.A. He F. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3535-3542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This study provides direct information on the phospholipid interaction of the signaling proteins in native disk membranes. In particular, we are interested in the dynamics of this protein-lipid interaction during activation of the signal cascade. To characterize this interaction, we incorporate spin-labeled phospholipids into disk membranes, and we probe their accessibility to extraction by bovine serum albumin (BSA) (15Haest C.W. Plasa G. Deuticke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In a previous study, employing this approach, we have shown that the interaction of rhodopsin with phosphatidylserine (PS) is dependent on its state of the activation, in agreement with earlier results (17Crain R.C. Marinetti G.V. O'Brien D.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4186-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) obtained by chemical labeling of PS in which rhodopsin was found to protect some of the PS of the membrane. During the lifetime of the active metarhodopsin II conformation, one molecule of PS became released by rhodopsin (18Hessel E. Müller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2538-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have now measured the extractability by BSA of spin-labeled phospholipid analogues from the disk membrane in the absence or presence of Gt and PDE, both in the dark and under conditions of light activation. In the present study, we identified privileged interactions of Gt and PDE phospholipids. Gt anchors in a small cluster of PS, whereas PDE binds to a large “cushion” of more than 70 ± 10 molecules of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Materials—Short chain spin-labeled phospholipid analogues 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxyl-pentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SL-PC), 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxyl-pentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (SL-PS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-(4-doxyl-pentanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (SL-PE) were synthesized as described previously (16Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 19Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3751-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Spin-labeled phospholipids (SL-PL) carried a long chain fatty acid at the sn-1 position and a short spin-labeled fatty acid at the sn-2 position with a paramagnetic nitroxide group at the fourth carbon position. All chemicals were purchased from VWR International, Fluka, Roche Applied Science, and Sigma. Preparation of Rod Outer Segments (ROS) and Disk Vesicles—ROS were purified from freshly dissected and frozen bovine retinae and prepared in the dark according to Kühn (20Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Osmotically intact disk vesicles were prepared by extraction of soluble and membrane-associated proteins as described (18Hessel E. Müller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2538-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and resuspended in 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]-propane (BTP) buffer (2% (w/v) sucrose solution, 130 mm NaCl, 20 mm BTP, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2) or Hepes buffer (5% (w/v) sucrose, 130 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, osmotic pressure 320 ± 5 mosmol) as indicated in the figure legends. To prepare isolated disks, the suspension was pressed through a filter with 2-μm pores (Nuclepore filter) and used immediately. The concentration of rhodopsin was determined spectrophotometrically using ϵ500 = 40,000 m–1 cm–1. To minimize lipid peroxidation during the experiment, we always used disk membranes that were freshly prepared and used immediately for spin label incorporation. Intact ROS that were prepared with their own complement of cytosolic anti-oxidants (prepared according to Schnetkamp (22Schnetkamp P.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 373: 25-45Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar)) and resuspended in a Ficoll/sucrose solution gave the same results as ROS prepared according to Kühn ((20Kühn H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 556-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), containing EDTA, dithiothreitol, and taurine). Also, disks in Ficoll/sucrose solution (22Schnetkamp P.P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1986; 373: 25-45Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and disks in salt/buffer/sucrose solution (see above) showed the same results. Protein Preparation—Gt and PDE were purified from bovine retinae essentially as described (23Heck M. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8220-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and stored in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.0, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol at –40 °C. Centrifugation Assay—The relative amount of soluble and membrane-associated Gt and PDE was determined using the centrifugation assay (24Kühn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 25Heck M. Pulvermüller A. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 329-347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The applications to the gels were normalized as follows. Aliquots (100 μl) of the samples used for the ESR/spin-label experiments (30 μm rhodopsin reconstituted with 5 μm Gt and/or 1 μm PDE) were incubated at room temperature and pelleted by centrifugation (5 min, 52,000 × g, 4 °C). After complete removal of the supernatant, each pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of buffer to yield the initial membrane concentration. To determine the amount of protein either bound to the membrane pellet or present in the supernatant, the same volume of supernatant or resuspended pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Measurement of Transbilayer Distribution of Spin-label Analogues— The SL-PL were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), transferred to a glass tube, dried under nitrogen, and mixed with the desired volume of buffer, leading to a suspension of SL-PL micelles. For labeling in the dark, disk membrane suspensions (30 μm rhodopsin, incubated with 5 mm diisopropyl fluorophosphate) were mixed with the label suspension corresponding to time 0 for all kinetic measurements. The final label concentration (30 μm) was 2% of total phospholipids. Independent of the preparation protocol, we found a complete uptake of spin-labeled phospholipids into disk membranes within 30 s after the addition of spin label at 20 °C. After insertion of SL-PL into the outer membrane leaflet of disks at 20 °C, the time-dependent decrease of the BSA-induced SL-PL extract-ability from the membrane was measured (15Haest C.W. Plasa G. Deuticke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 649: 701-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Morrot G. Herve P. Zachowski A. Fellmann P. Devaux P.F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3456-3462Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 18Hessel E. Müller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2538-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At times indicated in the figures, aliquots from the labeled membrane suspension were mixed with fatty acid-free BSA solution (3% final concentration (w/v)) for 1 min on ice to extract all lipid analogues accessible to BSA (21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). After centrifugation supernatant and pellet were frozen for further analysis. Influence of Proteins on Analogue Extractability—To investigate the influence of PDE, washed disk vesicles (30 μm rhodopsin) were either incubated with 1–3 μm PDE at 20 °C for 30 min in the dark before labeling, or PDE (0.5–3 μm) was added to disk membranes after SL-PL had equilibrated between the two membrane leaflets (see below). To remove PDE from the disk membranes after incubation, the pellets of the spin-labeled disk membranes were washed in solution of low salt concentration (8.5% sucrose (w/v), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, osmotic pressure 310 ± 10 mosmol) for 2 min (52,000 × g), and the concentrations of SL-PL in the supernatant and in the membrane pellet were measured by ESR spectroscopy as described below. To assess the influence of Gt, SL-PL were first allowed to equilibrate across the disk membranes (30 μm rhodopsin) in the dark. Subsequently, transducin (5 μm) was added, and activation of G-protein was started by adding GTPγS (30 μm final concentration). ESR signal intensities were corrected for the dilution effect caused by the addition of PDE, transducin, and/or GTPγS. To measure the SL-PC extractability by BSA after PDE addition, 700 μl of labeled disk vesicles with and without PDE addition (2 μm final concentration) were mixed with 350 μl of BSA (final concentration 3% (w/v)) and incubated further at 20 °C. At times indicated in the figures, 75-μl aliquots were taken from the samples, centrifuged, and washed, and both the supernatants and pellets were stored for analysis. ESR Measurements—The amount of SL-PL in the samples (supernatant and pellet) was determined from the mid-field peak of the respective ESR spectra (Bruker ECS 106 spectrometer, Karlsruhe, Germany). To reoxidize reduced nitroxide moieties, potassium ferricyanide (10 mm final concentration) was added. In the presence of diisopropyl fluorophosphate, analogue hydrolysis was less than 5% under the conditions. Experimental data are presented in the figures as the amount of SL-PL non-extractable from the disk membranes, either measured in the pellets or estimated from the BSA-containing supernatants. In both cases identical results were obtained. The increase with time of the non-extractable analogue fraction was fitted to a single exponential function, using a least squares fit procedure. Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were performed using the Mann-Whitney test. Membrane Binding of Gt and PDE—In vitro, membrane binding of both Gt and PDE depends on several factors, including protein and membrane concentration, ionic strength, pH, and temperature. We therefore used a centrifugation assay to quantify membrane binding of both proteins under the conditions of the spin-label experiments (24Kühn H. Nature. 1980; 283: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 26Heck M. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10000-10009Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). At the high membrane concentration (30 μm rhodopsin), about 70% of the Gt and PDE added bound to the membrane in the dark (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3). As expected, activation of Gt by GTPγS resulted in a substantial dissociation of Gt from the membranes (Fig. 1, lane 4), whereas Gt activation in the presence of PDE enhanced membrane binding of PDE (Fig. 1, lane 5). In addition, in the latter case a fraction of Gtα was retained on the membranes, consistent with enhanced membrane binding of the active PDE-GtαGTPγS complex formed (27Gray-Keller M.P. Biernbaum M.S. Bownds M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15323-15332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Catty P. Pfister C. Bruckert F. Deterre P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19489-19493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BSA Extraction of Spin-labeled Phospholipid Analogues—To identify and characterize the interaction of Gt and PDE with spin-labeled phospholipid analogues (SL-PL), we measured the BSA-extractable amounts of those analogues from disk membranes in the absence or presence of proteins. Briefly, the technique (18Hessel E. Müller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2538-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) consists of the following: (i) incorporation of SL-PL into the outer membrane leaflet, (ii) extraction of SL-PL localized in the outer leaflet with BSA after various incubation times, and (iii) centrifugation of membranes and quantification of SL-PL in the pellet (i.e. lipid analogues which remained in the membrane) and in the supernatant (i.e. BSA-extracted lipid analogues) by ESR spectroscopy. Upon mixture with membranes, analogues incorporated into the outer membrane leaflet within a few seconds (29Marx U. Lassmann G. Wimalasena K. Müller P. Herrmann A. Biophys.

Subsequently, the extractable amount of SL-PL decreases within minutes (Fig. 2A), which is explained by a redistribution of the SL-PL between outer and inner leaflet of the membrane. The final level of SL-PL available for back-exchange with BSA reflected the equilibrium distribution of SL-PL. We have discussed previously (21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to what degree the distribution between the outer and inner leaflet of the membranes of the SL-PL is a correct measure of the endogenous phospholipid species. It can be stated that in the case of PS, all available techniques yielded consistent results (17Crain R.C. Marinetti G.V. O'Brien D.F. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4186-4192Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Sklar L.A. Dratz E.A. FEBS Lett. 1980; 118: 308-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 31Miljanich G.P.

For PE, chemical probing of the native lipid yielded higher asymmetries than found with the SL-PL (21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1473-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 32Wu G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The three SL-PL analogues reached a stable equilibrium distribution with a mean half-time of less than 5 min. The data indicate (Fig. 2A) an almost symmetrical distribution of spin-labeled phosphatidylcholine (SL-PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (SL-PE), and a more asymmetrical distribution of spin-labeled phosphatidylserine (SL-PS), i.e. 75% of the spin label in the outer leaflet. This is the same distribution as was previously reported under slightly different conditions (see “Experimental Procedures”) (18Hessel E. Müller P. Herrmann A. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2538-2543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Hessel E. Herrmann A. Müller P. Schnetkamp P.P. Hofmann K.P. Eur. J.

Transducin Reduces the BSA Extraction of Spin-labeled PS—To investigate the interaction of Gt with SL-PL, Gt (5 μm) was added to the membranes after complete equilibration of SL-PL between the two leaflets. Subsequently, the extraction of SL-PL by BSA (1 min for each aliquot) was assayed in 5-min intervals and compared with that of samples without transducin. The influence of Gt activation on lipid interaction was investigated in a separate sample in which excess GTPγS was co-injected together with Gt. The sample was left in the dark to keep the amount of activated rhodopsin as low as possible. Even under these conditions Gt is activated within seconds by a small fraction of endogenous opsin/all-trans-retinal complexes present in the membranes (33Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B shows the fraction of SL-PL that remained in the membranes after BSA extraction in the presence of inactive or active Gt. SL-PS becomes significantly less extractable upon addition of Gt. In the presence of 5 μm Gt, additional 5.2 ± 0.6% of SL-PS was not accessible to BSA. This was not observed upon activation of Gt with GTPγS, indicating that it is the membrane-associated inactive holoprotein that specifically affects the extraction of SL-PS. A much smaller, if any, effect was measured for SL-PC or SL-PE (∼2% less extractable SL-PE with 5 μm Gt). Although we found consistently a slightly lower level of extraction, the effect was not significant, neither with nor without GTPγS. The extraction of SL-PS was repeated with different amounts of Gt. The membrane-bound non-extractable amount of SL-PS increased with Gt concentration (Fig. 2C). Similar results were obtained in the absence and presence of 1 mm MgCl2 (see “Experimental Procedures”). PDE Reduces the BSA Extraction of Spin-labeled PC and PE—To measure the influence of PDE on BSA extraction of SL-PL, disk membranes were preincubated with PDE (1–3 μm PDE, 30 min) in the dark to reach an equilibrium between membrane-bound and -soluble PDE. Subsequently, SL-PL were added, and their BSA-extractable portion was followed as described above (Fig. 3). In an alternative protocol, PDE was added to the disk membranes after SL-PL equilibration between both membrane leaflets (Fig. 3, insets). Fig. 3 shows the amount of SL-PL that remained in the membranes after BSA extraction, with and without pre-equilibration of the membranes with PDE. As seen in Fig. 3A, PDE had no effect on the extractability of SL-PS and did not affect the asymmetric distribution of PS between leaflets. In contrast to SL-PS, both SL-PC and SL-PE were significantly less extractable in the presence of PDE (Fig. 3, B and C). Under these conditions (3 μm PDE) about 17% less of SL-PC and 12% less of SL-PE were found in the BSA extract. Interestingly, the effect on SL-PL extractability was complete before the first aliquot was taken (i.e. within 1 min, see below). As Fig. 3 shows, both the time course and the magnitude of subsequent transbilayer movement of SL-PC and SL-PE remained unchanged. When the PDE was added after a stable plateau of SL-PL transbilayer distribution was reached (Fig. 3, insets), SL-PS extraction was not affected (Fig. 3A, insets), but both SL-PC and SL-PE became significantly less extractable. The effect was already recognizable at the first data point, i.e. 1 min after addition of 1 μm PDE (Fig. 3, B and C, insets); 6% of the SL-PC and 4% of the SL-PE resisted the BSA extraction. On a relative scale, this effect is similar to that seen for membranes preincubated with PDE. When the extraction was repeated with different amounts of PDE (preincubation protocol), the membrane-bound non-extractable amount of both SL-PC and SL-PE increased with PDE, whereas no influence of PDE was seen in the case of SL-PS (Fig. 4). The PDE-related non-extractable amount of SL-PC and SL-PE did not saturate within the concentration range investigated. Unfortunately, the onset of membrane aggregation above 3 μm PDE prevented the study of higher PDE concentrations. The Effect of PDE Is Reversible—To test the reversibility of the PDE effect, disks were preincubated with 2 μm PDE (30 min in the dark); SL-PC was added, and aliquots were taken after various incubation times for the back-exchange assay (PC control in Fig. 5A). In parallel, aliquots were taken, and the disks were pelleted by centrifugation and treated with low ionic strength buffer to release PDE from membranes (see “Experimental Procedures”). Quantitative removal of PDE was confirmed by analysis of the samples with the centrifugation assay (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 5A, the release of PDE from the disk membranes at low ionic strength resulted in a complete and immediate reversal of the PDE effect on SL-PC extractability. To verify that the washing procedure per se did not affect the extraction of analogues, the pellet of spin-labeled, PDE-bound membranes was washed with isotonic buffer (data not shown); PDE remained membrane-associated, and the amount of extracted analogues could not be reversed to the level of the control. The reversibility of the PDE effect was also seen when the membranes containing the labeled lipid were persistently incubated with BSA with or without PDE (Fig. 5B). Effect of PDE Activation on the Extraction of Spin-labeled Lipids—We asked next whether the simultaneous presence of Gt and PDE and/or their interaction in the active Gt-GTP-PDE complex affected the extraction of SL-PL. By using the protocol of Figs. 2 and 3, Gt, PDE, and GTPγS were successively added to the membrane suspension (Fig. 6). Consistent with the results described above addition of Gt resulted in a reduced extraction of SL-PS but not of SL-PE or SL-PC. The subsequent addition of PDE reduced the extract-ability of SL-PC and to a lower degree that of SL-PE but did not influence that of SL-PS. Thus, in the presence of both Gt and PDE, the effect of the respective proteins is simply superimposed, demonstrating that, in their inactive form, the two proteins act independently on the membrane lipids. Although we observed a reversal of the Gt-SL-PS interaction upon activation of Gt (see above), this was not seen when Gt was activated in the presence of PDE. Under this condition, reduced extractability of SL-PS was not reverted (Fig. 6A), although a significant fraction of active Gt dissociated from the membranes (see above and Fig. 1). Activation of Gt and PDE resulted in a significant further decrease of SL-PC extraction (Fig. 6B), consistent with the enhanced membrane binding of PDE (see above and Fig. 1). Interestingly, the effect was not seen with SL-PE (Fig. 6C). We have examined the interaction with membrane phospholipids of two proteins involved in visual signal transduction, namely, the G-protein transducin (Gt) and the effector, a cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase (PDE). In the native, osmotically intact disk vesicles, each rhodopsin molecule is surrounded by about 65 lipids (34Daemen F.J. Bonting S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2092932882,"Enhancing factor (EF), a growth factor modulator, is the mouse homologue of human secretory group II phospholipase A(2). EF exhibits growth-promoting activity in vitro, in the presence of epidermal growth factor, and also brings about phenotypic transformation of normal cells. In order to ascertain the role of EF in vivo, a human keratin-14 promoter was used to drive the expression of EF ectopically to squamous epithelial cells. The founder mouse and its progeny showed abnormal whiskers and a scaly, beaded tail. In these mice, keratinization pattern of the epidermis was disturbed and parakeratosis and acanthosis were noted. The transgenic mice, TgK14-EF, expressed EF in the suprabasal layers of tail epidermis as well as in the epithelial cells of hair follicle and sebaceous glands of skin. Expression of EF along with hyperplasia was also observed in other squamous epithelia such as buccal mucosa, tongue and oesophagus. TgK14-EF mice homozygous for the transgene showed delayed and scanty hair growth although the mice were healthy and fertile. The hemizygous TgK14-EF mice were sensitive to a two-stage chemical carcinogenesis and developed a higher number of papillomas than their normal littermates over the course of the experiment. The conversion rate of papilloma to carcinoma was two fold higher in the transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W1994958995,"Previous studies have shown early region 1A (E1A) gene to inhibit the proliferation of tumour cells with wild-type, but not mutant, p53. E1A has also been shown to downregulate c-erb-B-2/neu expression, resulting in inhibition of growth in c-erb-B-2/neu overexpressing tumour cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of E1A expression on four head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines that do not overexpress c-erb-B-2/neu. Cell cycle and Western blot analysis show E1A-mediated induction of apoptosis in all cell lines examined. This induction of apoptosis was independent of the p53 status as it occurred in the cell lines with wild-type, mutated or deleted p53. However, there was no evidence of E1A-induced apoptosis in a p53(+ve) normal human fibroblast cell line, 1BR3. Analysis of apoptosis in the SCC cell lines demonstrated E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR, which was overexpressed in each of these cell lines. Overexpression of an exogenously introduced EGFR, under the control of an E1A-insensitive heterologous promoter, blocked E1A induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR expression appears to be the cause, rather than a consequence of E1A-induced apoptosis in these SCC cell lines. Previous studies have shown downregulation of EGFR expression by PML. Interestingly, E1A expression in the HNSCC cells altered the pattern of PML distribution and induced the level of PML protein, thus suggesting that E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR may occur via direct or indirect interactions with PML. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway by which E1A can induce apoptosis and identify EGFR as a potential target for the development of therapeutic strategies against epithelial malignancies, the majority of which have abnormal EGFR expression."

RIP is a death domain containing serine/threonine kinase that was first described as a consequence of its association with TNFR1 (tumor necrosis factor-α receptor 1) and FAS (CD95) (6Stanger B.Z.

RIP has also been shown to associate with other TNFR family members such as RAIDD and DR3 (9Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Yu G.L. Lyons R.H. Garg M. Duan D.R. Xing L. Gentz R. Ni J. Dixit V.M.

Two other kinases, RIP2 and RIP3, were designated on the basis of the homology of their kinase domains to the corresponding domain of RIP, although other segments of these proteins are highly divergent. RIP2 (RICK/CARDIAK) is a caspase-associated recruitment domain-containing kinase that associates with TNFR1 and the TRAF1, TRAF5, and TRAF6 adaptors (11McCarthy J.V. Ni J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16968-16975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in Toll-like receptor signaling and has been shown to be important for both innate and adaptive immune responses (12Kobayashi K. Inohara N. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Nunez G.

Following TNFR stimulation, both RIP and RIP2 have been shown to recruit IKK-γ and to consequently contribute to the activation of the IKK complex, suggesting that these RIP family members function as scaffold-like molecules rather than as protein kinases when they activate NFκB (18Poyet J.L.

As with other RIP kinases, PKK can activate NFκB when overexpressed in cell lines, although the catalytic activity of PKK has been considered to be required for NFκB activation (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol.

Given our limited understanding of how PKK is activated and how it activates NFκB, we wished to further explore these issues biochemically. There is an appropriately positioned SXXXS motif in the activation segment of the catalytic loop of murine and human PKK (in kinase subdomains VII and VIII) that is identical to a motif in members of the MAP2K family that is phosphorylated by MAP3Ks (21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Although we have established that these serines are not required for the catalytic activity of PKK, we have identified two MAP3Ks, MEKK2 and MEKK3, that can phosphorylate PKK in a specific manner. Surprisingly, we have also determined that certain catalytically inactive mutants of PKK can activate NFκB, whereas other enzymatically compromised mutants cannot. Catalytically inactive mutants of PKK that are incapable of activating NFκB can block PMA-induced NFκB activation. These mutants do not abrogate but surprisingly enhance MEKK2- and MEKK3-induced activation of NFκB. Taken together, these data support a model in which PKK can participate in the activation of NFκB in both a kinase-dependent and a kinase-independent manner. Plasmids and Cell Lines—FLAG-tagged PKK has been described previously (4Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol.

Plasmids for MEKK2 and MEKK3 were kindly provided by Dr. Michael Karin and Dr. Gary Johnson. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate FLAG-tagged versions of all PKK mutants. 293T cells were maintained as described previously (4Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A.

U2OS cell lines stably expressing M96G-PKK were generated by co-transfection of pCMV-FLAG-M96G-PKK in conjunction with pBabePURO and maintained in complete medium supplemented with puromycin (1 μg/ml). Assays for Kinase Activity and Phosphorylation—293T cells were transiently transfected, and assays were performed as described previously (4Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100, and the post-mitochondrial supernatant was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG (M2 monoclonal; Sigma) antibodies. Equal amounts of each immunoprecipitate were analyzed using an anti-FLAG immunoblot assay and an in vitro kinase assay. Histone H1 (Sigma) was used as a substrate in in vitro kinase assays. Luciferase Assays—The luciferase assay was performed using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The pBIIxLuc NFκB reporter construct, containing four NFκB-binding sites upstream of a firefly luciferase reporter gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Sankar Ghosh (22Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar). A Renilla luciferase reporter construct, pRL-TK (Promega), was used to normalize for transfection. Thr184 Is a Critical Residue within the Activation Loop of PKK—A notable feature of the activation loop of PKK is an appropriately positioned SXXXS motif (Fig. 1A), characteristically seen in MAP2Ks, which is typically phosphorylated by MAP3Ks when MAP2Ks are activated. Mutation of these serine residues typically results in a catalytically inactive kinase, as has been experimentally demonstrated for a number of MAP2Ks including members of the MEK, SEK, and IκB kinase families (21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 23Zheng C.F. Guan K.L.

Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, the serine residues (Ser173 and Ser177; Fig. 1A) within this motif in PKK were mutated to alanines to assess their relevance to the catalytic activity of this kinase. Constructs encoding FLAG-tagged wild type and mutant PKKs were independently transfected into 293T cells. The lysates from these transient transfections were then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. Half of each immunoprecipitate was used in an in vitro kinase assay employing histone H1 as a substrate; the other half was examined using an anti-FLAG immunoblot assay (to assess protein levels). The catalytic activity of PKK was measured by examining the autophosphorylation of PKK and the phosphorylation of histone H1 in an in vitro kinase assay. We have previously shown that PKK migrates as two major species: a hyperphosphorylated 110-kDa band and an underphosphorylated 97-kDa band when FLAG-tagged PKK is over expressed in 293T cells, and we have also shown that the catalytic activity of PKK is required for it to become hyperphosphorylated (4Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Therefore, a third criterion for assessing catalytic activity is the decreased altered migration of PKK on a Western blot. Interestingly, the mutation of Ser173, Ser177, or both to alanines does not affect the catalytic activity of PKK (Fig. 1, B and C, compare lanes 2–4 with wild type PKK, lane 1) as assessed by any of these criteria. Furthermore, the mutation of these serines to glutamate residues does not appreciably increase the catalytic activity of PKK (data not shown), although similar mutants frequently, but not invariably, contribute to the activation of many MAP2Ks (21Alessi D.R. Saito Y. Campbell D.G. Cohen P. Sithanandam G. Rapp U. Ashworth A. Marshall C.J. Cowley S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that the SXXXS motif is not of relevance for the catalytic activation of PKK. We subsequently mutated additional serines and threonines that were proximal to the SXXXS motif (Fig. 1A). The S171A mutation in concert with the S173A/S177A mutation does not have any affect on the catalytic activity of PKK as measured in our assays (Fig. 1, B and C, lane 5). Thr184, which is conserved across all species (Fig. 1A), was mutated to an alanine, either alone or in conjunction with the S171A/S173A/S177A triple mutation. This latter combination, including T184A, is referred to as quadruple mutant (QM). Both T184A-PKK and QM-PKK exhibit markedly compromised catalytic activity as measured by autophosphorylation as well as the ability of PKK to phosphorylate histone H1 in an in vitro kinase assay. In addition, the T184A and QM mutants migrate largely as 97-kDa species, further suggesting that their catalytic activity has been compromised (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 6 and 7). Although the mutation of Thr184 to a glutamic acid (T184E) did not restore the catalytic activity of PKK (Fig. 1, B and C, lanes 8), these data suggest that Thr184 is a critical residue within the activation loop of PKK with respect to catalytic activity. MEKK2 and MEKK3 Can Phosphorylate PKK—As stated above, SXXXS motifs are characteristically found in the activation loops of MAP2Ks, and serine residues in these motifs are typically phosphorylated by MAP3Ks. Based on this knowledge, we surveyed a panel of MAP3Ks as to whether or not they could phosphorylate PKK. Because wild type PKK has been shown to be able to presumably phosphorylate itself in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1), a previously described catalytically inactive mutant of PKK, K51R-PKK (4Chen L. Haider K. Ponda M. Cariappa A. Rowitch D. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21737-21744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), was used in this assay (see Fig. 4). The MAP3Ks surveyed included MEKK1, MEKK2, MEKK3, MEKK4, ASK-1, c-Raf, and NIK, but only MEKK2 and MEKK3 were found to be able to phosphorylate PKK when co-transfected in 293T cells. This was demonstrated by the phosphorylation of K51R-PKK in an in vitro kinase assay and the decreased mobility of K51R-PKK on an anti-FLAG Western blot (Fig. 2A and data not shown).Fig. 2MEKK2 and MEKK3 can phosphorylate PKK.A, MEKK2 and MEKK3 can phosphorylate PKK in vivo and in an in vitro kinase assay. FLAG-tagged K51R-PKK was co-transfected with a panel of MAP3Ks into 293T cells; similar assays to those described in the legend to Fig. 1 were performed. B, S173A/S177A-PKK on a K51R mutant background can be phosphorylated by MEKK3. FLAG-tagged K51R PKK or triple mutant FLAG-tagged K51R/S173A/S177A PKK was co-transfected into 293T cells with vector DNA (pCMV5) or with MEKK3. An in vitro kinase assay (upper panel) and an anti-FLAG immunoblot assay (lower panel) were performed on immunoprecipitates, in a manner similar to that described in the legend to Fig. 1. C, FLAG-tagged versions of S173A/S177K PKK and quadruple mutant S171A/S173A/S177A/T184A PKK were co-transfected with vector or with MEKK3 into 293 T cells. An in vitro kinase assay (upper panel) and an anti-FLAG immunoblot assay (lower panel) were performed on immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We initially predicted that PKK would be phosphorylated by MAP3Ks on the serine residues within the SXXXS motif. However, we have already shown that these serines, when mutated to alanines, have no affect on the catalytic activity of PKK. Therefore, as expected in light of the data from Fig. 1, MEKK3 (Fig. 2B) and MEKK2 (data not shown) were still able to phosphorylate PKK when the SXXXS motif was mutated to AXXXA. This was assessed by the phosphorylation of PKK in an in vitro kinase assay and the altered migration of this kinase in an anti-FLAG Western blot. Some information regarding the sites that may be critical for the interaction of PKK with MEKK2 and MEKK3 came from the analysis of the quadruple mutant, QM-PKK (S171A/S173A/S177A/T184A). When MEKK3 (Fig. 2C) or MEKK2 (data not shown) is co-transfected with QM-PKK into 293T cells, a portion of QM-PKK becomes phosphorylated as evidenced by the appearance of a more slowly migrating PKK species on an anti-FLAG Western blot. However, neither MEKK3 nor MEKK2 can phosphorylate QM-PKK in an in vitro kinase assay, whereas they can phosphorylate K51R-PKK. In addition, the proportion of the slower migrating QM-PKK species in cells co-transfected with MEKK2 or MEKK3 is less than what is seen with K51R-PKK (co-transfected with MEKK3 or MEKK2) on an anti-FLAG Western blot (compare Fig. 2, B, lane 2, and C, lane 4). These results suggest that Thr184 may participate in the interaction between PKK and MEKK2/MEKK3. Some Catalytically Inactive Mutants of PKK Can Activate NFκB—It has recently been reported that PKK can activate NFκB when overexpressed in cell lines. In contrast to RIP, RIP2, and RIP3, this activity can be abolished when a point mutation (K51R or D143A) is made within the predicted ATP-binding pocket to catalytically inactivate this kinase (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31871-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Meylan E. Martinon F. Thome M. Gschwendt M. Tschopp J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Moreover, these catalytically inactive mutants can function in a dominant negative manner, blocking the induction of NFκB by a variety of different stimuli, including phorbol ester. Surprisingly, when the catalytically inactive mutants, K51R-PKK, QM-PKK (Figs. 1 and 2), and T184A-PKK (Fig. 1) were co-transfected with an NFκB reporter plasmid into 293T cells, we were able to detect a significant amount of NFκB activation, albeit to a lesser degree than with wild type PKK (Fig. 3). To further investigate whether the catalytic activity is in fact dispensable for PKK to activate NFκB, we generated three additional catalytically inactive mutants: M96G-PKK, D143A-PKK, and D143N-PKK. M96G-PKK represents a mutation within the predicted ATP-binding pocket that is thought to enlarge the pocket so that specially engineered ATP analogs may bind. Analogous mutations render some kinases unable to bind ATP and thus catalytically inactivate them (26Liu Y. Shah K. Yang F. Witucki L. Shokat K.M. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 91-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). D143A-PKK is an ATP-binding pocket mutation that has previously been shown not to activate NFκB (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31871-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). D143N-PKK represents a more conservative mutation of the aspartate residue similar to one that has been shown to catalytically inactivate other kinases (33Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast to the catalytically inactive kinases described above, when these mutants were co-transfected with an NFκB reporter construct into 293T cells, no NFκB activation was detected (Fig. 3). Therefore, we have identified two groups of catalytically inactive PKK mutants. One group (K51R-PKK, QM-PKK, and T184A-PKK) can activate an NFκB reporter construct when expressed in cell lines, whereas another group (M96G-PKK, D143A-PKK, and D143N-PKK), cannot. To determine whether there was a difference between these two groups of PKK mutants that might account for their distinct abilities to activate NFκB, we closely examined the catalytic activities of each of the mutants. All six of the catalytically inactive mutants and wild type PKK were individually expressed in 293T cells and immunoprecipitated by virtue of their FLAG tag. As before, half the immunoprecipitate was used in an in vitro kinase assay, with the other half being utilized in an anti-FLAG Western blot. All of the catalytically inactive mutants were unable to phosphorylate histone H1 to any appreciable degree in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4). In addition, all six mutants migrate primarily as a faster 97-kDa species, which is consistent with an underphosphorylated, catalytically inactive form. The only consistent difference that we have seen between the two groups is the degree of phosphorylation of these mutants in an in vitro kinase assay (Fig. 4, arrow). The PKK mutants that are able to activate NFκB in this assay (K51R-PKK, QM-PKK, and T184A-PKK; Fig. 4, lanes 2–4, arrow) appear to be phosphorylated to a greater extent than the mutants that cannot activate NFκB (M96G-PKK, D143A-PKK, and D143N-PKK; Fig. 4, lanes 5–7, arrow). This difference is not a result of a significant variation in protein levels, as can be seen from the Western blot (Fig. 4). Therefore, the specific phosphorylation seen may be accounted for either as a consequence of a small amount of catalytic activity (and therefore autophosphorylation) that these mutants still retain, the ability of these mutants to co-immunoprecipitate endogenous factors that can phosphorylate PKK, or both. If these mutants do have some residual kinase activity, then this would support the view that minimal catalytic activity of PKK is necessary for NFκB activation by this enzyme. On the other hand, if these mutants are able to associate with endogenous kinases/regulators that phosphorylate PKK (including endogenous PKK itself), which in turn facilitates the activation of NFκB, then these data suggest that PKK may also function in a kinase-independent scaffold-like manner to activate NFκB. These possibilities are explored further below. Regardless, these data suggest that the catalytic activity of PKK contributes in a major way to its ability to activate NFκB. Certain mutations that disrupt ATP-binding also decrease the ability of PKK to activate NFκB, clearly illustrating the importance of a kinase-dependent step in this pathway. Full-length PKK Is Necessary for the Optimal Activation of NFκB—We wished to further explore why K51R-PKK, generally considered to be an inactive kinase, can activate NFκB, and to assess what domains of PKK are necessary for NFκB activation. To address these issues, we created a series of truncation and deletion mutants of wild type PKK based on predicted domain structures. In addition, we introduced the K51R substitution into each of these truncation mutants (Fig. 5A). All truncation/deletion mutants that were catalytically active could activate an NFκB reporter construct when expressed in 293T cells, albeit to a lesser level than wild type PKK (Fig. 5B). Deletion of four ankyrin repeats alone or of the intermediate domain also compromised the ability of PKK to activate NFκB. These results suggest that the entire ankyrin repeat domain and the intermediate domain are necessary for the optimal activation of NFκB. Intriguingly, all of the truncation and deletion mutants surveyed that also contained the K51R mutation were unable to activate NFκB in our assay (Fig. 5B). We have already seen that these truncations significantly decrease the ability of wild type PKK to activate NFκB. These results suggest that the K51R mutation does indeed compromise the catalytic activity of this kinase. Because full-length K51R-PKK has only a fraction of the NFκB activating ability of wild type PKK, these assays further reveal the essential role of the ankyrin repeat region and the intermediate domain of PKK in NFκB activation. PKK Mutants That Cannot Activate NFκB Act as Dominant Negative Mutants and Block PMA-induced Activation of NFκB—It has been recently reported that catalytically inactive mutants of PKK can block PMA-induced activation of NFκB (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31871-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Meylan E. Martinon F. Thome M. Gschwendt M. Tschopp J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether specific domains of PKK were required in a catalytically inactive context to compromise PMA induced activation of NFκB. As expected, full-length M96G-PKK, which we have shown is catalytically inactive and cannot activate NFκB (Figs. 3 and 4), significantly blocks PMA-induced NFκB activation (Fig. 6). We then examined whether the truncation mutants K51R/442-PKK and K51R/304-PKK can also act in a dominant negative manner. As can be seen in Fig. 6, both of these mutants block PMA-induced activation of NFκB. This is an interesting observation given that the catalytically active forms of these mutants, 304-PKK and 442-PKK, are both able to activate NFκB (Fig. 5). Although it might have been predicted that inactive kinases containing the ankyrin repeat or intermediate domains or both might have been required to compete with endogenous PKK, it is clear that the catalytically compromised kinase domain of PKK alone suffices to abrogate PMA-mediated activation of NFκB. Dominant Negative PKK Does Not Block the NFκB Activating Ability of MEKK2 and MEKK3—Aside from PMA-induced activation of NFκB, we were interested in identifying other pathways in which PKK may contribute to NFκB activation. Transient co-transfection-based luciferase assays for NFκB activation, in which a dominant negative form of PKK is used in conjunction with other expression constructs, have been used to examine whether PKK lies downstream of specific receptors or signaling molecules. In our hands these kinds of transient assays give highly variable results most likely because of varying expression levels and transfection efficiencies. We therefore generated U2OS cell lines that stably express M96G-PKK and chose three stable transfectants that expressed increasing amounts of mutant PKK (Fig. 7A) to examine whether specific MAP3Ks may be functionally linked to PKK. We have already shown that two specific MAP3Ks, MEKK2 and MEKK3, can phosphorylate PKK (Fig. 2). These two kinases have been reported to activate NFκB (27Bonvin C. Guillon A. van Bemmelen M.X. Gerwins P. Johnson G.L. Widmann C. Cell Signal. 2002; 14: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 28Blank J.L. Gerwins P. Elliott E.M. Sather S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5361-5368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if PKK were required for the activation of NFκB by MEKK2 or MEKK3, then M96G-PKK would be expected to compromise the activation of NFκB by these MAP3Ks in our stable U2OS transfectants. It is clear from Fig. 7B that MEKK2 and MEKK3 do not activate NFκB in a PKK-dependent manner, implying that PKK does not functionally lie down-stream of these MAP3Ks. Surprisingly, the ability of MEKK2 and MEKK3 to activate NFκB was enhanced in U2OS cells expressing intermediate levels of M96G-PKK (p < 0.05) as well as in cells expressing higher levels of M96G-PKK (p < 0.01; Fig. 7B). In contrast, M96G-PKK did not significantly influence the activities of MEKK1, which activates NFκB (Ref. 29Nemoto S. DiDonato J.A. Lin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7336-7343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 7B) but does not phosphorylate PKK (Fig. 2A and data not shown), or MEKK4, which neither phosphorylates PKK (data not shown) nor activates NFκB (Ref. 30Gerwins P. Blank J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar and Fig. 7B). To test the possibility that M96G-PKK contributes to MEKK2- and MEKK3-mediated activation of NFκB as a result of being phosphorylated by these MAP3Ks, we initially asked whether MEKK2 or MEKK3 can phosphorylate M96G-PKK. Surprisingly, MEKK2 (data not shown) and MEKK3 (Fig. 7C) are unable to phosphorylate M96G-PKK as measured by in vitro kinase assay and Western blot. Although we do not understand the relevance of the interaction between PKK and these MAP3Ks, these data lend some support to the view that PKK may participate in the activation of NFκB in a kinase-independent manner. Very little is understood about the mechanisms by which PKK is activated or about the process by which PKK activates NFκB. We have presented evidence that Thr184, located within the activation loop, is critical with respect to the catalytic activity of PKK. In addition, we have shown that specific MAP3Ks, MEKK2 and MEKK3, can phosphorylate PKK, and this phosphorylation event is influenced by Thr184. Every domain of PKK, including the kinase domain, the intermediate domain, and the ankyrin repeat region, contributes to its ability to activate NFκB. Finally, we have provided evidence that supports a model that PKK can act in both a kinase-dependent and a kinase-independent manner to activate NFκB, and this is discussed here. The role for the catalytic activity of PKK in the activation of NFκB is most evident when we consider that wild type PKK activates NFκB to levels that are significantly higher than those induced by catalytically inactive mutants. Identification of proteins phosphorylated by PKK may be crucial to obtaining a better understanding of this pathway. Perhaps this kinase-dependent step requires the autophosphorylation of PKK and/or the phosphorylation of a downstream target. Indeed, other RIP-like kinases have been reported to phosphorylate factors involved in cell signaling events. RIP has been shown to phosphorylate and catalytically activate MEKK1 (31Kim J.W. Joe C.O. Choi E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27064-27070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and RIP2 has been shown to phosphorylate and catalytically activate ERK2, thereby activating AP-1 (32Navas T.A. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33684-33690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, PKK may phosphorylate and thereby activate a down-stream factor that can activate NFκB. More surprising are the results that suggest PKK may participate in the activation of NFκB in a kinase-independent manner. The observation that K51R-PKK, QM-PKK, and T184A-PKK, three presumably catalytically inactive mutants, can activate NFκB when overexpressed in cell lines was unexpected, given that it has been reported that the catalytic activity of PKK is absolutely required for the activation of NFκB (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31871-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Meylan E. Martinon F. Thome M. Gschwendt M. Tschopp J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The question obviously arose as to whether or not these mutants are truly catalytically inactive. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that QM-PKK and T184A-PKK retain a small amount of catalytic activity, there is considerable evidence to suggest that K51R-PKK is catalytically inactive. The mutation of this critical lysine within the ATP-binding domain has been well characterized as one that ablates the ability of a kinase to associate with ATP (33Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 34Vetrie D. Vorechovsky I. Sideras P. Holland J. Davies A.

Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3812) Google Scholar). Additional evidence comes from the analysis of truncation mutants that carry the K51R mutation. All of the catalytically active truncations of wild type PKK can activate NFκB to some degree in our hands, whereas truncation mutants that carry the K51R mutation act as dominant negative inhibitors, blocking PMA-induced NFκB activation. If the K51R mutation retained some catalytic activity, it would have been expected that these truncation mutants would not have acted in a dominant negative fashion. We therefore believe that many pieces of evidence suggest that K51R-PKK is catalytically inactive and that these data illustrate that PKK can activate NFκB in a kinase-independent manner. How then do K51R-PKK, QM-PKK, and T184A-PKK activate NFκB in a kinase-independent manner? Some evidence comes from in vitro kinase studies, where we have observed that these PKK mutants become slightly phosphorylated. It could be that phosphorylated PKK can recruit other proteins that contribute to the activation of NFκB. As stated earlier, RIP and RIP2 are thought to recruit IKK-γ and assemble the IKK complex in a kinase-independent manner (18Poyet J.L. Srinivasula S.M. Lin J.H. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Yamaoka S. Tsichlis P.N. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37966-37977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 19Inohara N. Koseki T. Lin J. del Peso L. Lucas P.C. Chen F.F.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 301-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Because PKK can activate NFκB in IKK-γ-deficient cells (1Muto A. Ruland J. McAllister-Lucas L.M. Lucas P.C. Yamaoka S. Chen F.F. Lin A. Mak T.W. Nunez G. Inohara N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31871-31876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), it is possible that PKK recruits IKK-β, or some other unidentified protein in the IKK complex, to activate NFκB. In addition, PKK may possibly recruit other kinases, such as MEKK2 or MEKK3, to the IKK complex to facilitate the activation of NFκB. Why three additional catalytically inactive PKK mutants, M96G-PKK, D143A-PKK, and D143N-PKK, cannot activate NFκB when expressed at high levels is still unclear. It may be that these mutations may contribute to a more global distortion of PKK, blocking their association with other factors, possibly other kinases. This is evidenced by the observation that these mutants are not phosphorylated in an in vitro kinase assay. Functional studies avoiding the use of PKK overexpression may reveal further insights into this pathway. We do not fully understand why K51R-PKK activates NFκB in our studies, whereas it has been shown to act as a dominant negative mutation by others (2Meylan E. Martinon F. Thome M. Gschwendt M. Tschopp J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). One possible explanation is that we used mouse PKK with a K51R mutation in our studies, whereas the other study used a human K51R-PKK mutant. There are a number of small structural differences between human and murine PKK, some of which might contribute to species-specific differences in PKK function. A more detailed analysis might provide further insights regarding NFκB activation by PKK. We have also provided evidence that PKK is phosphorylated by two MAP3Ks, MEKK2 and MEKK3. This phosphorylation appears to be specific, because other MAP3Ks were tested and were not found to phosphorylate PKK, although it should be noted that this panel was far from exhaustive, and there still may be other MAP3Ks that can phosphorylate PKK. Ser173 and Ser177, the serines within the SXXXS motif are not phosphorylated by MEKK2 and MEKK3. We have shown that Thr184 may participate in the interaction between MEKK2/3 and PKK. However the significance of the phosphorylation of PKK by MAP3Ks remains unclear. Interestingly, RIP2 has been reported to be phosphorylated by the MAP3K, c-Raf, even though it does not contain the canonical SXXXS motif; this interaction is important for the activation of ERK2 (32Navas T.A. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33684-33690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between MEKK2 and MEKK3 with PKK may have parallels when one considers other RIP kinases and MAP3Ks, the biological significance of this interaction remains to be determined. It is clear from these data that PKK can activate NFκB in both a kinase-dependent and a kinase-independent manner. The relative contributions of each of these mechanisms, which may not be mutually exclusive, remains to be ascertained. Further studies involving PKK-deficient cells may prove useful in this regard.

The average backbone root-mean-square deviation for residues 4–35 is 0.728 ± 0.217 Å from the mean structure. The solution structure consists of a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet connected by a type-I β-turn after a short helical turn. All secondary structures and a conserved disulfide bond are located in the C-terminal half of the peptide, residues 18–36. Overall folding is stabilized by a combination of a disulfide bond, seven hydrogen bonds, and numerous hydrophobic interactions. The structural motif of the C-terminal half shares a significant tertiary structural similarity with chitin-binding domains of plant and invertebrate chitin-binding proteins, even though scarabaecin has no overall sequence similarity to other peptide/polypeptides including chitin-binding proteins. The length of its primary structure, the number of disulfide bonds, and the pattern of conserved functional residues binding to chitin in scarabaecin differ from those of chitin-binding proteins in other invertebrates and plants, suggesting that scarabaecin does not share a common ancestor with them. These results are thought to provide further strong experimental evidence to the hypothesis that chitin-binding proteins of invertebrates and plants are correlated by a convergent evolution process.

A 36-residue peptide named scarabaecin isolated from hemolymph of the coconut rhinoceros beetle Oryctes rhinoceros has been found to show strong antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi. 1T.

The plant chitin-binding domain consists mostly of 30–43 residues, including eight cysteines, three aromatic residues, and glycines, and is frequently referred to as a hevein domain (4Beintema J.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This domain is indispensable to antimicrobial activity and shows significant conservation in the primary sequence (>40%) and in the tertiary structure (5Andersen N.H. Cao B. Rodriguez-Romero A.

Although chitin is an important structural component of invertebrates, fungi, and bacteria, chitin-binding proteins of invertebrates have only recently been characterized (9Kawabata S. Nagayama R.

Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) involving a high percentage of cysteine and aromatic residues similar to the plant chitin-binding domain. However, scarabaecin has only two cysteine residues in the sequence and shows no sequence similarity to other chitin-binding proteins in plants and invertebrates. Moreover, a computer-aided homology search of scarabaecin indicated that this antifungal peptide has no significant sequence similarity to peptides/polypeptides so far reported, suggesting that a novel immune peptide occurs in the coleopteran insect. 1T. Tomie, J. Ishibashi, S. Furukawa, S. Kobayashi, R. Sawahata, A. Asaoka, M. Tagawa, and M. Yamakawa, submitted for publication. The solution structure of tachycitin, a 73-residue polypeptide from the horseshoe crab that has chitin-binding and antimicrobial activity (9Kawabata S. Nagayama R. Hirata M. Shigenaga T.

A comparison of the tertiary structure of tachycitin with that of a plant chitin-binding protein, hevein, showed that tachycitin shared a remarkable local structural similarity with hevein (15Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The local structure consists of an antiparallel β-sheet and a helical turn, and the secondary structures are constructed in both proteins in highly similar manners. Because the conserved structural motif was identified as an essential chitin-binding domain for hevein, the structural domain of tachycitin was assumed to serve as an essential chitin-binding site. The residues of cysteine, proline, and glycine, all of which may significantly influence structural construction, were well conserved in the structural motif of both proteins. Conservation of polar and hydrophobic residues was identified for putative chitin-binding residues (15Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of tachycitin and 3D structure-based sequence alignment between chitin-binding proteins in invertebrates and plants for the region corresponding to Cys-40–Gly-60 of tachycitin as the conserved structural motif are thought to provide faithful evidence for the recent hypothesis (14Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) that chitin-binding proteins of invertebrates and plants are correlated by a convergent evolution process (15Suetake T. Tsuda S.

The residues of cysteine, proline, and glycine in the amino acid sequence of scarabaecin were well conserved by comparing amino acid sequences focusing on putative chitin-binding domains among scarabaecin, tachycitin, hevein, and other invertebrate and plant chitin-binding proteins.1 Conservation of polar and hydrophobic residues was further identified for putative chitinbinding residues.1 Thus, it is worth determining the tertiary structure of scarabaecin and comparing it with those of tachycitin and hevein to clarify that scarabaecin has a conserved structural motif as a chitin-binding site, even though this peptide has no overall sequence similarity to other peptides/polypeptides, including chitin-binding proteins. In this study, we determined the 3D structure of scarabaecin in solution by 2D 1H NMR spectroscopy and distance geometrysimulated annealing calculation. The solution structure showed that the backbone conformation of the conserved structural motif as a putative chitin-binding site in scarabaecin was very similar to those in hevein and tachycitin. The length of the primary sequence and the number of disulfide bonds in scarabaecin, however, differ from those in hevein and tachycitin, indicating a new pattern of conserved amino acid residues at the chitin-binding site. These results provide additional evidence to support the convergent evolution proposed for horseshoe crab and plant chitin-binding proteins (15Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K. Iwanaga S. Hikichi K. Nitta K. Kawano K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17929-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, we discuss conserved functional residues crucial for binding to saccharides and the relationship between the conserved structural motif and antimicrobial specificity. Sample Preparation—The peptide scarabaecin was synthesized by solid-phase methodology with Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-amino acids and formed a disulfide bond between Cys-18 and Cys-29 using 2,2′-bispyridyl disulfide as described elsewhere.1 The resulting peptide was purified by reversed-phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and the molecular mass and amino acid sequence were determined using a matrix-assist laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer and a protein sequencer.1 NMR Spectroscopy—A NMR sample was prepared by dissolving the synthetic peptide in 500 μl of 90% H2O/10%D2O or 99.96% D2O solution. The final peptide concentration was ∼3 mm and pH was 2.4. All NMR spectra were obtained on Bruker Avance500 and Avance800 spectrometers with quadrature detection in the phase-sensitive mode by time proportional phase incrementation (TPPI) (16Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3514) Google Scholar) and States-TPPI (17Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar). The following spectra were recorded at 20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C with 15 ppm spectral widths in the t1 and t2 dimensions: 2D double quantum-filtered correlated spectroscopy (DQF-COSY) (18Rance M.

Commun. 1983; 117: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (2593) Google Scholar), recorded with 512 and 2048 complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions; 2D homonuclear total correlated spectroscopy (TOCSY) (19Davis D.G. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 2820-2821Crossref Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) with DIPSI-2 mixing sequence, recorded with mixing times of 35, 60, and 80 ms, 512 and 2048 complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions; 2D nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy (20Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar), recorded with mixing times of 60, 100, 200, and 400 ms, 512 and 2046 complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions; and 2D rotating frame NOE spectroscopy (21Griesinger C. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 261-271Google Scholar), recorded with mixing time of 100 ms, 512 and 1024 complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions. The high digital resolution DQF-COSY and exclusive 2D scalar COSY (22Griesinger C. Sorensen O.W. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1987; 75: 474-492Google Scholar) spectra were recorded using 800 and 4096 complex points in the t1 and t2 dimensions. Water suppression was performed using WATERGATE sequence (23Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (3487) Google Scholar, 24Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1993; 102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). 2D 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectroscopy (25Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185Crossref Scopus (2407) Google Scholar) was recorded with 1024 × 128 complex points for 15 ppm in the 1H dimension and 100 ppm in the 13C dimension at a natural isotope abundance. Slowly exchanging amide protons were determined by lyophilizing the protein from an H2O solution, dissolving the protein in D2O, and collecting sequential 2-hour 2D TOCSY spectra. All NMR spectra were processed using XWINNMR (Bruker) and Felix2000 (MSI, San Diego, CA). Peak-picking and assignment were performed with Sparky program (UCSF; www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/). Before Fourier transformation, the shifted sine bell window function was applied to the t1 and t2 dimensions. All 1H dimensions were referenced to internal 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate. 13C dimensions were indirectly referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate at 25 °C (26Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2045) Google Scholar). Structure Calculations—NOE-derived distance restraints were classified into three ranges, 1.8–2.7 Å, 1.8–3.5 Å, and 1.8–5.0 Å, according to the relative NOE intensities. Upper distance limits for NOEs involving methyl protons and nonstereospecifically assigned methylene protons were corrected appropriately for center averaging (27Wüthrich K. Billetter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In addition, a distance of 0.5 Å was added to the upper distance limits only for NOEs involving methyl proton (28Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Nilges M. Ryan C.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8012-8023Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) after correction for center averaging. Torsion angle restraints on the backbone ϕ-angle were derived from 3JHN-Hα coupling constants from the high digital resolution 2D DQF-COSY spectra and intraresidue and sequential NOEs. We obtained 30 ϕ angle restraints. Backbone ϕ-angles were restrained to–60° ± 30° for 3JHN-Hα < 6 Hz and–120° ± 40° for 3JHN-Hα > 8 Hz. The additional ϕ-angle restraint of 100° ± 80° was applied to residues for which the intraresidue HN-Hα NOE was clearly weaker than the NOE between HN and the Hα of the preceding residue (29Clubb R.T. Ferguson S.B. Walsh C.T. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2761-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). An ψ-angle restraint was used for residues in β-strand structures, as predicted from the chemical shift index (30Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) and from NOE patterns characteristic of the secondary structure. Five ψ-angles in the β-sheet region were restrained to 120° ± 60°. Side-chain χ1-angles were determined by 3JHα-Hβ coupling constants from exclusive 2D scalar COSY and short-mixing TOCSY connectivities combined with NH-Hβ and Hα-Hβ NOEs (31Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumman T. Go N. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). We obtained seven χ1-angle restraints. The χ1-angle restraints were normally restricted to ±60° from staggered conformations, g+ (+60°), t (180°), or g–(–60°). Hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments identified seven hydrogen bond donors. Corresponding hydrogen bond acceptors were determined based on NOE patterns observed for regular secondary structural regions and preliminary calculated structures without restraints regarding hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen-bond restraints were applied to N–H and C=O groups: 1.7–2.4 Å for the H–O distance and 2.7–3.4 Å for the N–O distance. Structure calculations were performed using the hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing method using X-PLOR 3.851 (32Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1 Manual. Yale University, New Haven, CT.1993Google Scholar). A total of 502 interproton distance restraints and 36 dihedral angle restraints were used to calculate an ensemble of structures. The structure calculation proceeded in two stages by using the standard X-PLOR protocol. In the first stage, a low-resolution structure was preliminarily determined using NOE-derived distance restraints and dihedral angle restraints, except for ψ-angle restraints. In the second stage, the same protocol was applied by adding hydrogen bond restraints and ψ-angle restraints. The force constants for the distance restraints were set to 50 kcal mol–1 Å–2 throughout all the calculations, and dihedral angle restraints were initially set to 5 kcal mol–1 rad–2 during the high-temperature dynamics and gradually increased to 200 kcal mol–1 rad–2 during the annealing stage. The final round of calculations began with 200 initial structures, and the best 20 structures were selected and analyzed with MOLMOL (33Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar), InsightII (MSI, San Diego, CA), and PROCHECK-NMR (34Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The average coordinates of ensembles of the 20 lowest energy structures were subjected to 1000 cycles of Powell restrained minimization to improve stereochemistry and nonbonded contacts. Structure figures were generated using MOLMOL. Resonance Assignment and Secondary Structure—Essentially complete 1H resonance assignments were obtained for the peptide using spin system identification and sequential assignment (35Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, New York.1986Crossref Google Scholar). Any ambiguous peaks caused by overlapping with water resonance or degeneration in the chemical shift were resolved by comparing NOE spectroscopy and TOCSY spectra at four different temperatures (20 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C) and by combining with the 2D 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum. The fingerprint region of the DQF-COSY spectrum collected at 25 °C is shown in Fig. 1 with sequence-specific resonance assignments. In these assignments, Hα(i)-Hδ(i+1:Pro) (dαδ) or Hα(i)-Hα(i+1:Pro) (dαα) NOEs instead of dαN were used for Pro residues. All four proline residues (Pro-3, Pro-6, Pro-19, and Pro-32) showed strong dαδ NOEs, indicating that all proline residues in the peptide have a trans configuration. Finally, the resonance assignments for the backbone and side-chain 1H were completed except for the amide 1H of Glu-1. The resonance assignment was extended by determining stereospecific assignments of methylene protons to obtain high-precision NMR structures. Stereospecific assignments of β-methylene protons were obtained for 7 of 28 residues of the peptide using information on 3JHα-Hβ coupling constants from exclusive 2D scalar COSY and qualitatively estimated from short-mixing time TOCSY spectra combined with intraresidue NH-Hβ and Hα-Hβ NOEs. A qualitative analysis of short- and medium-range NOEs, 3JHα-Hβ coupling constants, and a slowly exchanging amide proton pattern was used to characterize the secondary structure of scarabaecin (Fig. 2A). The absence of consecutive Hα(i)NH(i+3) NOEs and only one small 3JHN-Hα coupling constant (<6 Hz) indicated that scarabaecin did not have an α- or 310-helix. An antiparallel β-sheet was identified from large 3JHN-Hα coupling constant (>8 Hz) and its characteristic NOE pattern: strong consecutive sequential dαN(i,i+1) and long-range interstrand dαα(i, j) cross-peaks. From these data, a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet consisting of the two regions of residues Val-23–Ans-25 and Asp-28–Lys-30 was identified in scarabaecin (Fig. 2B). The existence of the β-sheet was supported by four slowly exchanging NH protons at positions 23, 25, 28, and 30, and chemical shift index pattern (Fig. 2A). The region Asn-25–Asp-28, linking the two β-strands and residues 23–25 and 28–30, was identified as a β-turn based on characteristic NOE patterns, weak Hα(i)-NH(i+2) connectivity, and weak NH(i)-NH(i+2) connectivity between Gly-26 and Asp-28 (Fig. 2B). The slow exchanging NH proton at position Asp-28 supports the presence of the tight turn (Fig. 2A). Tertiary Structure of Scarabaecin—The 3D structure of scarabaecin was determined based on the distance and dihedral angle restraints from the NMR data using the hybrid distance geometry-simulated annealing approach. 200 structures were calculated. Of these, 20 final structures showing the lowest energy values, no distance constraint violation of >0.5 Å, and no dihedral constraint violation of >5° were selected. The restraints used and the structural statistics for the final structures are summarized in Table I. The structures exhibited good covalent geometry and stereochemistry, as evidenced by the low r.m.s.d. values for bond, angle, and improper from idealized geometry. In a Ramachandran plot, 100% of backbone dihedral angles of the 20 structures fall in either core or allowed regions. Fig. 3A shows best-fit superposition of backbone atoms of the 20 structures of scarabaecin. The r.m.s.d.s of these structures from the average structure were 0.72 ± 0.21 Å for backbone heavy atoms in the whole sequence (excluding three N-terminal residues and one C-terminal residue, Lys-4–Phe-35) and 1.30 ± 0.23 Å for all heavy atoms in the same region, whereas the corresponding values were 0.35 ± 0.14 Å for backbone heavy atoms and 0.84 ± 0.23 Å for all heavy atoms in the C-terminal half region of residues 18–35 involving all secondary structure elements and a conserved disulfide bond. This data indicates that the C-terminal half region of residues 18–35 converges very well in the calculated structures.Table IStatistics for best 20 NMR structures of scarabaecinTotal restraints used538Total distance restraints502Intraresidue128Sequential165Medium (1 <|i - j| < 5)82Long (|i - j| ≥ 5)117Hydrogen bond (2 per bond)10Total dihedral angle restraints36ϕ25ψ4χ17Energies (kcal/mol)aThe final values of the square well NOE and dihedral angle potentials were calculated with force constants of 50 kcal mol-1 Å-2 and 200 kcal mol-1 rad-2, respectively.

The β-turn, residues 25–28, was classified as type I based on dihedral angles of Gly-26 and Phe-27, the hydrogen bonding between Asn-25 and Asp-28, and the spatially positions of carbonyl oxygen of Gly-26 and Cβ of Phe-27. All secondary structures of scarabaecin are located in the C-terminal half of the peptide (residues 18–36), not in the N-terminal half (residues 1–17). Seven hydrogen bond donors were observed in hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments. Four hydrogen bonds (Val-23–HN–Lys-30–O, Ans-25–HN–Asp-28–O, Asp-28–HN–Asn-25–O, and Lys-30–HN–Val-23–O) were found within the secondary structures, and one hydrogen bond (Ile-12–HN–Asn-17–Oδ1) was determined from the preliminary structures; five hydrogen bonds were confirmed from the final 20 structures. Evidence for two additional hydrogen bonds (Leu-5–HN–Pro-3–C and Val-10–HN–Asp8–O) was observed in a subset of the family of structures. Within the ordered portion of the molecule, a subset of side chains forms a well-defined hydrophobic core centered on Pro-19 and the disulfide bond between Cys-18 and Cys-29. These residues have NOE contacts to side chains of Leu-5, Pro-6, Leu-11, and Trp-24. The chitin-binding domains of plants and invertebrates involve a high percentage of cysteine residues in their sequences, and cysteine residues have been elucidated in maintaining protein fold (14Shen Z. Jacobs-Lorena M. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). However, scarabaecin has only two cysteine residues, Cys-18 and Cys-29, to form a disulfide bond. The N-terminal half of the peptide (residues 1–17) has no secondary structure or disulfide bond. Thus, the overall folding of scarabaecin is stabilized by a combination of one covalent disulfide linkage (Cys-18–Cys-29), seven hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic side chain packing consisting of seven residues (Leu-5, Pro-6, Leu-11, Cys-18, Pro-19, Trp-24, and Cys-29) (Fig. 3C). Comparison of the Tertiary Structure of the Conserved Structural Motif in Scarabaecin with Those in Tachycitin and Hevein—So far, the plant chitin-binding domains have been well characterized by information on their primary sequences, 3D structures, and functional experiments. Less is known about invertebrate chitin-binding proteins, however. Recently, the solution structure of tachycitin was determined as the first 3D structure of invertebrate chitin-binding protein by using 2D NMR methods (15Suetake T. Tsuda S. Kawabata S. Miura K.

Members of the first subfamily use zinc ions for interactions with histidine 81 on the β-chain of MHC class II molecules, whereas members of the second subfamily use zinc ions for dimer formation. The zinc-binding motif is located in the C terminus of the molecule in both subfamilies. While our recent studies with Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived mitogen (MAM) have provided the first direct evidence demonstrating the binding to MHC class II molecules in a zinc-dependent manner, it still not known how zinc coordinates the interaction. Data presented here show that the zinc ion is mainly required to induce MAM/MAM dimer formation. Residues in the N terminus of MAM are involved in dimer formation and MHC class II binding, while histidine 14 and aspartic acid 31 of the MAM sequence are the major residues mediating MAM/MAM dimerization. Zinc-induced dimer formation is necessary for MAM binding, MHC class II-induced cell-cell adhesion, and efficient T cell activation. Together these results depict the unique mode of interaction of MAM in comparison with other superantigens.

However, we still have very little information on the modes of interaction of most members of the SAg family. It is well known that each SAg has a unique way of interacting with the TCR, MHC class II molecules, and the presented antigen. While several SAgs share common binding residues to MHC class II and TCR Vβ regions, their interactions with the peptide binding groove and presented antigen are unique and have proven critical in eliciting certain cellular responses (29Li Y. Li H. Dimasi N. McCormick J.K. Martin R. Schuck P. Schlievert P.M. Mariuzza R.A. Immunity. 2001; 14: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 30Petersson K.

Med. 1996; 183: 1083-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Discrepancies in SAg interactions with the peptide binding groove and the loaded peptide antigen have revealed the existence of discrete subsets of MHC class II molecules with identical peptide binding capabilities (40Thibodeau J. Cloutier I. Lavoie P.M. Labrecque N. Mourad W. Jardetzky T. Sekaly R.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Based on co-crystal analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and competitive binding studies, it has become clear that three different modes of interaction can govern SAg binding: 1) SAgs that bear one MHC class II-binding site and interact mostly with the α-chain (40Thibodeau J. Cloutier I. Lavoie P.M. Labrecque N. Mourad W. Jardetzky T. Sekaly R.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar); 2) SAgs that bear two MHC class II-binding sites, one of which is involved in the interaction with the α-chain and the other of which is involved with the β-chain of another MHC class II molecule in a zinc-dependent fashion (22Hudson K.R. Tiedemann R.E. Urban R.G. Lowe S.C. Strominger J.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar); 3) SAgs that are capable of forming zinc-dependent homodimers that interact either with the two α- or the two β-chains of two different MHC class II molecules (41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization and/or oligomerization of MHC class II molecules by SAgs is functionally important as it seems to be required for cytokine gene expression and cell-cell adhesion. Thus, zinc has a major role in defining the activity and the potency of a SAg in the response of an immune system. Mycoplasma arthritidis-derived mitogen (MAM) is a less studied SAg initially neglected because it was thought to act exclusively in mice and rats but has generated much interest since it was shown to bind human MHC class II molecules (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This particular SAg is produced by mycoplasmas and has the unique property of inducing a spontaneous, chronic form of arthritis in genetically susceptible strains of rodents that histologically resembles rheumatoid arthritis in humans (42Cole B.C. Atkin C.L. Immunol. Today. 1991; 12: 271-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Unlike current murine models of human arthritis such as K/BxN mice (43Korganow A.S. Ji H. Mangialaio S. Duchatelle V. Pelanda R. Martin T. Degott C. Kikutani H. Rajewsky K. Pasquali J.L. Benoist C. Mathis D.

Rheumatol. 1995; 7: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), serum from MAM-induced arthritic mice does not cause the disease when injected into healthy mice and is more representative of the human form of the disease (45McDevitt H. Arthritis Res. 2000; 2: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 46Matsumoto I. Maccioni M. Lee D.M. Maurice M. Simmons B. Brenner M. Mathis D. Benoist C. Nat.

Engl. Ed. 1999; 66: 45S-49SPubMed Google Scholar). This feature is essential in developing a representative model for arthritis because adoptive transfer experiments should not cause disease when transferring serum from an arthritic subject to a normal host. MAM may therefore offer hope for developing a more representative murine model of human rheumatoid arthritis. A comprehensive, detailed model of MAM interactions with both MHC class II-positive and T cells is therefore essential. We have unraveled some of the mystery surrounding MAM interactions with human cells over the past few years. Although M. arthritidis is thought to be essentially a murine pathogen, we have shown that MAM binds to human MHC class II with an affinity similar to that of other staphylococcal SAgs and can potently activate APCs and T cells (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 50Bernatchez C. Al-Daccak R. Mayer P.E. Mehindate K. Rink L. Mecheri S. Mourad W. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also have discovered that MAM can cross-link MHC class II in the presence of zinc ions (51Etongue-Mayer P. Langlois M.A. Ouellette M. Li H. Younes S. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results presented in this report indicate that MAM forms dimers in the presence of zinc ions. By generating MAM deletion mutants, we identified key residues involved in zinc binding to MHC class II, which is required for APC activation. We also show that, even in absence of zinc binding residues, MAM can be presented as monomers at undetectable levels by MHC class II and can activate certain Vβ repertoires of TCRs, which perhaps have a higher affinity for interactions with MAM. Lastly we propose the first detailed model describing MAM interactions with APCs and T cells accounting for most observations reported in the literature. Hopefully this model will serve as the starting point for designing the first arthritic murine model using MAM and mutant MAM SAgs. Cell Lines—The human Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid cell line LG2 (DR1/DR1) and the murine T cell clones 3DT (Vβ 8.2), RG17 (Vβ 6), and Kmls (Vβ 15.8) were provided by Dr. R. P. Sékaly (Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal, Montreal, Canada). The human B cell line LAD (derived from a LFA-1-deficient patient) was kindly donated by Dr. R. Geha (Children's Hospital, Boston, MA). The B cell lines and murine T cell clone 3DT were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol. The murine T cell clones RG17 and Kmls 15.8 were maintained in Iscove's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, and 2-mercaptoethanol. The IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 T cell clone was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 5 units/ml IL-2. Antibodies, Peptides, and Superantigens—Recombinant SEA and MAM (wild type MAM (MAMwt), MAM-21, and MAM-15) were produced as GST fusion proteins as described previously (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). MAMwt is the wild-type, full-length 213-amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa. MAM-15 and MAM-21 have deletions from residues 132 to 213 and 177 to 213, respectively, in their C termini. Histidine 14 and aspartic acid 31 substitutions were generated by PCR using specific primers: 5′-CATTAGGATCCATGAAACTTAGAGTTGAAAGTCCTAAAAAAGCTCAAAAGGCTTTTGTGCAAAATTTAAATAATGTTGTATTTACTAATAAAGAGCTTGAAGCTATCTACAATT-3′ and 5′-GTTATATGAATTCAATATTAATCTTC-3′. The PCR products were digested with EcoR1 and BamH1 and ligated into the pGEX-6P-1 plasmid. Based on the MAM sequence (52Cole B.C. Knudtson K.L. Oliphant A. Sawitzke A.D. Pole A. Manohar M. Benson L.S. Ahmed E. Atkin C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), three different peptides corresponding to various MAM regions were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic (San Antonio, TX). Peptide 1, amino acids 14–31: HFVQNLNNVVFTNKELED; peptide 2, amino acids 76–90: FNMMFLKLSVVFDTQ; and peptide 3, amino acids 197–211: DIELKTTSDFAKAVF. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Zn2+-induced MAM Dimerization—All toxins were incubated in the presence of 2 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min. The cross-linking agent bismaleimidohexane (BMH, Pierce) was dissolved in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) in the presence of 10 mm Me2SO prior to coupling with the proteins. Dithiothreitol was removed by dialysis with zinc-free PBS. The samples were then incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm Zn2+ for 1 h. BMH was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the reaction was incubated for a further 2.5 h at 4 °C. Reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and separated by electrophoresis in a 12% Tris/glycine acrylamide gel. The separated proteins were then stained with Coomassie Blue. Radiolabeling of SAgs—Ten micrograms of each toxin were iodinated in 30 μl of phosphate buffer (0.5 m, pH 7.4) with 0.25 μCi of 125I (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, 1 Ci = 37 GBq) and 0.1 m chloramine T (Sigma) for 2 min. The reaction was stopped by adding sodium metabisulfite and KI. The labeled protein samples were separated from free iodine on Sephadex G-25 columns (Bio-Rad) blocked previously with 2% bovine serum albumin. Specific activity for all experiments varied between 12,000 and 18,000 cpm/nmol. Binding Assays and Kd Evaluation—Binding assays, affinity measurements, and competition curves were performed as described elsewhere (40Thibodeau J. Cloutier I. Lavoie P.M. Labrecque N. Mourad W. Jardetzky T. Sekaly R.P. Science. 1994; 266: 1874-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Standard binding assays used 5 × 105 LG2 cells incubated with a 20-nm concentration of radiolabeled toxin in a 200-μl final volume of PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 μm zinc, and 0.02% NaN3 for 2 h at room temperature. To purify samples by the removal of unbound toxins, the cell suspension was transferred to tubes containing an oil cushion (84% silicon oil, 16% mineral oil). Cell pellets containing intact cells bound to toxins were recovered after centrifugation, and their activity (cpm) was determined using a γ counter. Competition experiments were performed by adding different concentrations of unlabeled SAgs to a constant number of cells and labeled SAgs. Binding affinities (Kd) were evaluated by non-linear regression using Prism software (GraphPad Software) (51Etongue-Mayer P. Langlois M.A. Ouellette M. Li H. Younes S. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Cell-Cell Adhesion Assay—A 100-μl suspension of LAD cells (106 cells/ml) was added to the wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. SAgs were then added to a final concentration of 5μg/ml. After 3 h of stimulation at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, cell-cell adhesion was monitored using a light microscope, and photographs were taken. T Cell Proliferation ([3H]Thymidine Incorporation)—The assay was performed as described elsewhere (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 × 104 APCs were added to 8 × 104 T cell clones (3DT, RG17, or Kmls) in a 96-well microtiter plate in the presence of different concentrations of MAMwt and mutant MAM (MAMmut). After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, the supernatants were collected and added to IL-2-dependent CTLL-2 cells. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was then added, and the plate was incubated for a further 16 h. After the final incubation, [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a Coulter β-counter. Zinc Ions Are Required for MAM/MAM Homodimer Formation—While our recent studies indicated that zinc is an absolute requirement for MAM/MHC class II interactions, zinc ions do not coordinate MAM binding to HLA-DR molecules through histidine 81 of the β-chain as demonstrated for other zinc-dependent SAgs (22Hudson K.R. Tiedemann R.E. Urban R.G. Lowe S.C. Strominger J.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that zinc ions may be required for the formation of MAM/MAM homodimers as reported previously for SED (22Hudson K.R. Tiedemann R.E. Urban R.G. Lowe S.C. Strominger J.L. Fraser J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar) or for the coordination of MAM binding to HLA-DR through a zinc-binding motif other than histidine 81 as suggested for SEH (53Hakansson M. Petersson K. Nilsson H. Forsberg G. Bjork P. Antonsson P. Svensson L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 527-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To investigate the first possibility, zinc was added to the recombinant MAM protein followed by the BMH cross-linker. This cross-linker creates a covalent link between cysteines of two SAgs brought in close proximity by zinc ions. Protein complexes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described for SED (41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). The SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1A) shows that, like SED, MAM could only be detected as a dimer when samples were treated with zinc followed by BMH cross-linker. In contrast, and as expected, SEA failed to form dimers under these conditions. Involvement of Histidine and Aspartic Acid in Dimer Formation—In recent studies, we demonstrated that the MAM/HLA-DR interaction is completely inhibited by peptides encompassing MAM residues 14–31 (peptide 1) and residues 76–91 (peptide 2) but is not affected by a peptide encompassing residues 197–211 (peptide 3) (51Etongue-Mayer P. Langlois M.A. Ouellette M. Li H. Younes S. Al-Daccak R. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). It was also reported that peptides 1 and 2 can inhibit MAM-induced lymphocyte proliferation (52Cole B.C. Knudtson K.L. Oliphant A. Sawitzke A.D. Pole A. Manohar M. Benson L.S. Ahmed E. Atkin C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1105-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Based on these observations and the above results, we looked at whether one of these MAM regions is involved in dimer formation. To address this issue, we tested the three peptides for MAM dimer inhibition. Interestingly peptide 1, which encompasses residues 14–31, inhibited dimer formation by 69%, whereas the other two peptides had no effect (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that amino acid residues located in peptide 1 might play an important role in coordinating binding to zinc ions through dimer formation. To identify the residues specifically involved in zinc coordination, we referred to previous studies with SED showing a critical role of histidine (His) and aspartic acid (Asp) in SED/SED dimer formation (41Al-Daccak R. Mehindate K. Damdoumi F. Etongue-Mayer P. Nilsson H. Antonsson P. Sundstrom M. Dohlsten M. Sekaly R.P. Mourad W. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 225-232PubMed Google Scholar). According to the literature, at least two different residues from each molecule coordinating a zinc ion are required for homodimer formation. Known amino acids capable of coordinating zinc are histidine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid (54Chi Y.I. Sadler I. Jablonski L.M. Callantine S.D. Deobald C.F. Stauffacher C.V. Bohach G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22839-22846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Peptide 1 (HFVQNLNNVVFTNKELED) has a histidine at position 1 (His-14) and an aspartic acid at position 18 (Asp-31). We therefore hypothesize that these are the most likely residues involved in MAM dimerization. By site-directed mutagenesis, a codon coding for alanine (GCT) was substituted at positions occupied by His-14 (CAT) and Asp-31 (GAT) in MAM cDNA. MAMmut recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli as described for MAMwt. Both MAMwt and MAMmut were tested for dimer formation in the presence of zinc. Fig. 2A shows that substitution of His-14 and Asp-31 by alanine completely abolished zinc-induced MAM/MAM dimer formation. In contrast, zinc-induced dimer formation using MAM deletion mutants (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) MAM-21 (deletion of residues 197–213) and MAM-15 (deletion of residues 131–213) was unaffected as dimers can be seen at the expected sizes (Fig. 2B). These results now allowed us to conclude that His-14 and Asp-31 residues are critical for dimer formation. Indeed, since MAMwt and MAM-15 have a similar binding affinity to MHC class II molecules and MAM-15 is deleted of the C terminus (residues 132–231), it is obvious that all MAM residues involved in MHC class II binding are located in this fragment, which is in accordance with our recent published observation (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MAM-21, MAM-15, and MAMwt Have Similar HLA-DR Binding Affinities—We then examined the binding affinities of truncated MAM-21 and MAM-15 to MHC class II to determine whether there were any other key binding residues implicated in the binding of truncated proteins. Binding assays were done in PBS containing bovine serum albumin and sodium azide thereby preventing internalization and turnover of receptors on the cell surface (38Langlois M.A. Etongue-Mayer P. Ouellette M. Mourad W. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 1748-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows the results of a MAM/MHC class II binding competition assay using labeled MAMwt, cold MAM-"

https://openalex.org/W2011521410,"The ErbB-2/Neu receptor tyrosine kinase plays a causal role in tumorigenesis in mammals. Neu's carboxyl terminus contains five phosphorylated tyrosines that mediate transformation through interaction with cytoplasmic SH2 or PTB containing adaptor proteins. We show that Drosophila adaptors signal from individual phosphotyrosine sites of rat Neu. Activated Neu expression in the midline glia suppressed apoptosis, similar to that seen with activated Drosophila EGF-R expression. Expression in eye and wing tissues generated graded phenotypes suitable for dosage-sensitive modifier genetics. Suppression of ErbB-2/Neu-induced phenotypes in tissues haplosufficient for genes encoding adaptor protein or second messengers suggests that pTyr 1227(YD) signals require Shc, and that pTyr 1253 (YE) signalling does not employ Ras, but does require Raf function. Signalling from pTyr (YB) was affected by a haplosufficiency in drk (Grb-2), and in genes thought to function downstream of Grb-2: dab, sos, csw (Shp-2), and dos (Gab-1). These data demonstrate the power of Drosophila genetics to unmask the molecules that signal from oncogenic ErbB-2/Neu."

It also induces a strong lymphokine-activated killer cell response. A series of truncated peptides were analyzed by circular dichroism and analytical centrifugation to elucidate the role of p1–30 residues.

It is involved in inflammatory reactions and immune responses (1Smith K.A. Science. 1988; 240: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (1876) Google Scholar, 2Taniguchi T. Matsui H. Fujita T. Takaoka C.

Science. 1992; 257: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The effects of IL-2 on its target cells are mediated by specific cell surface receptors (IL-2Rα, IL-2Rβ, and IL-2Rγ) (5Thèze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol. Today. 1996; 10: 481-486Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (215) Google Scholar) encoded by three different genes (6Minami Y. Kono T. Miyazaki T. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev.

IL-2Rα, the first component to be identified, is a 55-kDa protein that binds to IL-2 with a Kd of ∼10 nm (8Uchiyama T. Broder S. Waldmann T. J.

The second IL-2R component, IL-2Rβ, is a 75-kDa protein with a large intracytoplasmic domain (286 amino acids) (10Teshigawara K. Wang H.M. Kato K. Smith K.A. J. Exp.

Munakata H. Nakamura M. Sugamura K. Science. 1992; 257: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ belong to the hematopoietin receptor family (14Thèze J. Eur. Cytokine Network. 1994; 5: 353-368PubMed Google Scholar), whereas IL-2Rα belongs to a different and unrelated family (15Giri J.G. Kumaki S. Ahdieh M. Friend D.J. Loomis A. Shanebeck K. DuBose R. Cosman D. Park L.S. Anderson D.M. EMBO. J. 1995; 14: 3654-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Two receptors are functional in the human system. The association of human IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ forms a receptor of intermediate affinity with a Kd of ∼1 nm, whereas the expression of all three chains leads to the formation of a high affinity IL-2R (Kd ∼10 pm). A structural model of the IL-2·IL-2R complex derived from the three-dimensional structure of growth hormone-GH receptor co-crystals has been discussed (5Thèze J. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Immunol.

Interactions among IL-2 and the IL-2Rβ and IL-2Rγ subunits have already been analyzed (17Sauvé K. Nachman M. Spence C. Bailon P. Campbell E. Tsien W.-H. Kondas J.A. Hakimi J. Ju G. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biophys. 1993; 307: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and the experimental data appear to support the model. We and others (21Eckenberg R. Xu D. Moreau J.L. Bossus M. Mazie J.C. Tartar A. Liu X.Y. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Thèze J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that α-helix A in IL-2 (residues 8–28) is essential for binding to the IL-2Rβ chain, the most important component of the IL-2R system critically involved in signal transduction. More recently, we showed that peptide p1–30, which includes α-helix A, tetramerizes and forms bundles of four helices, thus mimicking the structure shown by a cytokine of the hematopoietin family. This neocytokine behaves as an IL-2 partial mimetic after binding to its receptor, which is composed of IL-2Rβ dimers (22Eckenberg R. Rose T. Moreau J.-L. Weil R. Gesbert F. Dubois S. Tello D. Bossus M. Gras H. Tartar A. Bertoglio J. Chouaib S. Goldberg M. Jacques Y. Alzari P.M. Thèze J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, p1–30 activates intracellular Shc and p56lck but fails to activate the Janus kinases (Jak1 and Jak3) or the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). By contrast, p1–30 activates Tyk2, another Janus-like kinase. At the immunological level, p1–30 induces lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and preferentially activates CD8 lymphocytes and NK cells, which constitutively express IL-2Rβ chains. Significant production of interferon γ is also detected after p1–30 stimulation. IL-2 is used in cancer therapy, but its therapeutic potential is limited by various side effects including a significant “vascular leak syndrome.” Because p1–30 is specifically targeted to cytotoxic cells, it may have selective anti-tumor activity. Furthermore, our data suggest that active analogs of p1–30 could be developed with a higher therapeutic index. Because p1–30 has therapeutic potential and is a unique tool to assess the role played by the different IL-2R chains in the mechanism of signal transduction, we investigated the structural features of this neocytokine and the nature of its interactions with its receptor. We have already reported a preliminary analysis of the molecular basis of p1–304 tetramerization. Furthermore, we showed that extracellular NH2-terminal domain (fragments 31–200) of the IL-2Rβ μβ molecule forms a dimer in solution prior to the binding of p1–30 (22Eckenberg R. Rose T. Moreau J.-L. Weil R. Gesbert F. Dubois S. Tello D. Bossus M. Gras H. Tartar A. Bertoglio J. Chouaib S. Goldberg M. Jacques Y. Alzari P.M. Thèze J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In this paper, we further examine the role played by p1–30 residues in the structure of active molecular species based on a structural study of peptide fragments covering different parts of the peptide. The correlation between the structural properties of these peptides and their effects on cell activation is analyzed. We clarify the importance of p1–30 tetramerization in receptor recognition. We confirm that IL-2Rβ forms dimers in solution prior to the binding of p1–30. We present theoretical three-dimensional models of free p1–30 and IL-2Rβ as well as a model of the p1–304·IL-2Rβ2 complex built by comparative modeling using as templates the free and bound crystallographic structures of the erythropoietin receptor (23Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) and human growth hormone receptor (24De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Finally, we propose a mechanism for signal transduction through a conformational change of IL-2Rβ2 triggered by p1–30 binding. Cell Lines and Proliferation Assays—The T cell line TS1β was derived from the IL-9-dependent mouse T cell line TS1 transfected with human IL-2Rβ and grown in IL-2 (25Pitton C. Rebollo A. Snick J.V. Thèze J. Garcia A. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). All of the cultures used complete medium supplemented with recombinant human IL-2 (Chiron-Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Peptide synergy with IL-2 was tested by an indirect assay of proliferation. Cells were stimulated by various concentrations of IL-2 in the presence of 60 μm peptides in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (104 cells/well in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 105 cells/well). After 36 h of stimulation, cultures were pulsed for 15 h with 0.5 μCi/well [3H]thymidine. All of the measurements were made in duplicate (averages are shown), and all of the experiments were carried out at least three times. Representative experiments are shown. IL-2 Peptides and IL-2Rβ—Peptides were synthesized and purified as described previously (21Eckenberg R. Xu D. Moreau J.L. Bossus M. Mazie J.C. Tartar A. Liu X.Y. Alzari P.M. Bertoglio J. Thèze J. Cytokine. 1997; 9: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They were then verified by mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis after total hydrolysis. The following IL-2 peptides were used here (numbers indicate the position in the IL-2 sequence): p1–30, p1–22, p10–30, p1–31, p1–10, p5–15, p15–25, and p20–30. In p1–31Lys-20, Asp-20 was replaced by Lys. In p1–30Cys-31, a Cys was added at the COOH terminus of the p1–30 sequence. Molar extinction coefficients were calculated for the peptides from their UV absorptions at 230 and 242 nm (12,133 and 2047 m–1 cm–1, respectively, for p1–30) scaled on their amino acid analysis. p1–30Cys31 was labeled on the COOH-terminal Cys-31 with a fluorescein group. 6.10–7 mol of lyophilized peptide was mixed with 5.10–6 mol of fluorescein 5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) in 200 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate and 150 mm NaCl buffer at pH 7.2 and gently spun for 16 h at 20 °C. Excess dye was removed by two successive exclusion chromatography runs. The purified labeled peptide p1–31CysFlc31 (a molecular mass of 3805 Da, ϵ242 nm 2104 m–1 cm–1, ϵ490 nm 83,000 m–1 cm–1, n = 0.732 ml/mg) with a fluorescein group (Flc) branched on the COOH-terminal Cys-31 accounted for >92% peptide. The 31–230 residues of the IL-2Rβ chain (IL-2Rβ31–230, a molecular mass of 23,352 Da) were produced and purified as a solubilized fragment as described by Eckenberg et al. (22Eckenberg R. Rose T. Moreau J.-L. Weil R. Gesbert F. Dubois S. Tello D. Bossus M. Gras H. Tartar A. Bertoglio J. Chouaib S. Goldberg M. Jacques Y. Alzari P.M. Thèze J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient of this fragment was calculated from its UV absorption at 280 nm (59,450 m–1 cm–1) scaled on its amino acid analysis. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Molecular Weight Analysis—CD measurements were acquired in the far-UV on a spectropolarimeter (Jobin-Yvon CD6, Paris). 5–20 scans were recorded from 180 to 260 nm at 20 °C in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The helix content was estimated from CD spectra (26Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Diffusion-sedimentation equilibrium studies were performed at 20 °C on peptide solutions (10 and 150 μm) or on IL-2Rβ31–230 (1 and 14 μm) in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuging system at 25,000 and 42,000 rpm and standard double sector cells with 1.2-mm thick aluminum centerpieces. Absorbances were recorded at 230, 242, and 360 nm for the peptides and 280 and 360 nm for IL-2Rβ31–230. Lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, and diluted to the desired concentration with the same buffer. 150 μl of peptide or protein sample solution were introduced into the sample sector of the centrifugation cell onto 50 μl of fluorocarbon FC43. The corresponding equilibration buffer (210 μl) was placed in the reference sector. Absorbances were recorded as a function of radial distance at different wavelengths depending on initial peptide or protein concentration and centrifugation speed. After reaching the selected centrifugation speed, radial scans were recorded at 2-h intervals for at least 18 h to check that an equilibrium had been reached. 10–99 successive scans were recorded and averaged. It was checked at 360 nm that no optical artifacts were affecting the base line. Protein distribution at equilibrium was analyzed by Origin-based Optima XL-A data analysis software (Beckman). The different fitting models (single ideal component, two ideal components, and association of identical ideal components) for single data sets (XLA-Single program) were systematically tested, and the best fit was retained on the basis of both the χ2 value and the lack of systematic deviation of the residuals. In all of the cases, the base line was set at zero absorbance and not allowed to drift during the fitting procedure. Partial specific volume values (n) used in the molecular weight calculations were determined from the amino acid composition of the peptides (p1–10, n = 0.710 ml/mg; p5–15, n = 0.722 ml/mg; p10–20, n = 0.759 ml/mg; p1–22, n = 0.720 ml/mg; p10–30, n = 0.752 ml/mg; p20–30, n = 0.729 ml/mg; p1–30, n = 0.710 ml/mg; p1–31Cys31, n = 0.710 ml/mg; and p1–31CysFlc31, n = 0.732 ml/mg) and IL-2Rβ31–230 (n = 0.719 ml/mg). Solvent density was taken as 1.001g/ml at 20 °C. The binding of p1–30, p1–31Cys-31, and p1–31CysFlc31 to IL-2Rβ31–230 was tested by analytical ultracentrifugation in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.1, at 20 °C. We used a 3-cell rotor for each experiment: one cell was filled with peptide, one was filled with IL-2Rβ31–230, and the last was filled with a mixture of peptide and IL-2Rβ31–230. Peptide and IL-2Rβ31–230 concentrations were 50 and 14 μm, respectively. Absorbances were recorded at 242, 280, and 490 nm after reaching equilibrium at 22, 25, 28, and 42 × 103 rpm. P1–30 Models—Several models of four helical p1–30 peptides were built using the crystal structures of IL-2 (3INK) (4MacKay D. Science. 1992; 257: 410-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), erythropoietin (1BUY) (27Cheetham J.C. Smith D.M. Aoki K.H. Stevenson J.L. Hoeffel T.J. Syed R.S. Egrie J. Harvey T.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and the bacterial ColE1 operon repressor ROP (1ROP) (28Banner D.W. Kokkinidis M. Tsernoglou D. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 657-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) as templates downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (29Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (26214) Google Scholar). Peptides p1–302 were threaded along the two longest helices of IL-2 (residues 8–28 and 83–96 from 3INK), respecting the hydrophobic side chain periodicity. The final tetramer was then built by symmetry operations. Every interacting helix pair is anti-parallel and annotated 1-1-1-1 (up-down-up-down) by counting the number of parallel-oriented neighbors. The helices were arranged in other configurations along the same four longitudinal axes using different symmetry operators to build tetramers with four parallel helices annotated 4 (up-up-up-up), three parallel helices, and one antiparallel helix annotated 3-1 (up-up-up-down) and 2× two parallel helices annotated 2-2 (up-up-down-down). Residues were substituted, and hydrogens were added by Insight II software (Accelrys, San Diego,CA). The conformation of the peptide bundle was optimized by simulated annealing during molecular dynamic runs and then minimized (200 steepest descent and then 300 conjugate gradient steps) by Discover software (Accelrys). We used the CFF91 force field, set the dielectric constant ϵ to 1*r (r is the distance between charges), and fixed the non-bond cut off to 14 Å during the dynamics and to infinity during the minimization processes. Models of the IL-2R β231−230 Receptor and the p1–304·IL-2R β231−230 Complex—IL-2R α-, β-, and γ-chain sequences were downloaded from the Swiss Protein data base as IL2A_HUMAN, IL2B_HUMAN, and CYRG_HUMAN (www.expasy.ch). The IL-2R β- and γ-chains were aligned by ClustalX software (30Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35074) Google Scholar) using the secondary structure frame from erythropoietin and growth hormone receptors as constraints. We built three structures for IL-2Rβ2 by comparative modeling using Modeler 4 software (31Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10292) Google Scholar). We folded two sequences of β-chain fragments 31–200 over the homodimeric erythropoietin receptor (1ERN) (23Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) in its free form and over the erythropoietin-bound form (1EER) (32Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). We then folded the same sequences over the homodimeric human growth hormone receptor (3HHR) (24De Vos A.M. Ultsch M. Kossiakoff A.A. Science. 1992; 255: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). Four p1–304 helix bundle arrangements were then docked between the two β-chains of the two models super-imposed over templates composed of EPO·EPOR (1EER) and GH·GHR (3HHR), yielding eight models depicting the complexes. The free and bound forms were optimized by molecular dynamics and minimization as noted earlier for the helix bundles. 50 models for each complex were ranked according to their stereochemical quality, secondary structure contents were evaluated by the Procheck 3.0 software (33Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar), the compatibility of folds with sequences were scored by Verify 3D (34Eisenberg D. Luthy R. Bowie J.U. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (1527) Google Scholar), and the side chain contact statistics were processed by the What-Check (35Hooft R.W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar). Solvent-accessible surface areas (ASA) were computed using the Connolly algorithm rolling a spherical probe 1.4 Å in radius around van der Waals spheres of atoms. The interface between two molecules (ΔASA) was calculated as the difference between the complex surface area and the sum of the two separated component surface areas. Binding Free Energy Estimation—The relative binding free energies between two molecules were estimated from the three-dimensional models using a method based on the areas of polar (oxygen and nitrogen atoms) and non-polar surfaces (carbon and sulfur atoms) exposed to solvent after component dissociation (36Baker B.M. Murphy K.P. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 295: 294-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as shown in Equation 1. ΔASA=ΔASApolar+ΔASAnonpolar (Eq. 1) Changes in heat capacity ΔCp,calc were calculated from the expression shown in Equation 2. ΔCp,calc=−0.26 ΔASApolar+0.43 ΔASAnonpolar(Eq. 2) Changes in enthalpy ΔH0 were evaluated at 60 °C using the expression shown in Equation 3, ΔH33,0000=29.19 ΔASApolar−7.27 ΔASAnonpolar (Eq. 3) and they were extrapolated at 25 °C as shown in Equations 4 and 5. ΔCp,calc=(ΔH298,0000−ΔH333,0000)/(333−298) (Eq. 4) ΔH298,0000=ΔCp,calc/(333−298)+ΔH333,0000 (Eq. 5) Changes in entropy were calculated as the sum of the conformational entropy ΔSconf0, the association entropy DSasso0, and the solvation entropy ΔSsol0 defined in Equation 6, ΔSconf0=Sin(ΔASASC,l/ASAAXA-SC,l)SBUEX0+Sin(ΔASABB,j/ASAAXA-BB,j)SBB0+Sin(ΔASABB,i/ASAAXA-BB,l)SEx-U0 (Eq. 6) where ΔASASC,i and ΔASABB,i are the ASA changes in the side chain or the backbone of residue i on binding. ASAAXA-SC,i and ASAAXA-BB,i are the ASA of the side chain or the backbone of residue i in an extended Ala-X-Ala tripeptide. Values for backbone entropy SBB0 and SEx-U0 were drawn from d'Aquino et al. (37D'Aquino J.A. Gomez J. Hilser V.J. Lee K.H. Amzel L.M. Freire E. Proteins. 1996; 25: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and the values for chain entropy ( SBuEx0) were from Lee et al. (38Lee K.H. Xie D. Freire E. Amzel L.M. Proteins. 1994; 20: 68-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) as shown in Equations 7 and 8. ΔSasso0=−7.89 cal K−1mol−1 (Eq. 7) ΔSsol0=ΔCp,calcln(298/385) (Eq. 8) Finally, the binding free energy was computed from ΔG0 =ΔH0–TΔS0. Structure-Function Analysis of IL-2 Peptides—The biological effects of various IL-2 peptides were investigated on the IL-2 proliferation of TS1β cells. Synergy was measured for various concentrations of IL-2 in the presence of different peptide sizes at 60 μm (Fig. 1). This experiment showed that p1–30, p1–31, and p1–31Lys-20 induced the same level of cell proliferation, whereas p10–30 induced 25% less and p20–30 induced 50% less. P1–10, p5–15, p10–20, and p1–22 did not stimulate cell proliferation at all. The secondary structures of p1–10, p5–15, p1–22, p10–20, p10–30, and p1–30 were studied by circular dichroism. Fig. 2A shows the spectra obtained in the far-UV range with 150 μm peptides p1–10, p10–20, p20–30, p5–15, p10–30, p1–22, and p1–30. Only two peptides showed >5% helical conformation under these conditions: p10–30 (35 ± 5%) and p1–30 (50 ± 5%) (Table I). The concentration dependence of the dichroic signal was also evaluated between 3 and 150 μm for each peptide (Fig. 2B). The helix content of p1–30 and p10–30 depended on the peptide concentration. The maximum helix content was obtained for p1–30 above 30 μm, and the half-maximum was obtained at 6 μm. For p10–30, the maximum was above 100 μm, and the half-maximum was obtained at 60 μm. The dichroism signal at 198 nm was weakly concentration-dependent for peptides p1–22 and p20–30 (Fig. 2B). Both peptides have very low helix contents but a propensity to form β-strands (Fig. 2A) independent of the peptide concentration above 50 μm and dependent on the peptide concentration below 50 μm (Fig. 2B). p1–10, p5–15, and p10–20 did not form any periodic secondary structures under the test conditions.Table ISecondary and quaternary structure of peptides in solutionPeptidesSequencesActaActivity obtained with p1-30 in the presence of 1 nmIL-2 (y, active; n, non-active; NT, non-tested).HelixbPercentage of helix determined by CD.StatecMajor species in solution.

Open table in a new tab The quaternary structure of p1–30 was analyzed by sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium experiments performed at various peptide concentrations, spanning its impotent function to potent function. The results are illustrated in Fig. 3 and are reported in Table I. p1–30 behaved mainly as a tetramer below 10 μm and as an octamer at 150 μm. The tetramer-octamer Kd is approximately 60 μm. Below 10 μm, the molecular masses obtained for the lightest species ranged between 10,340 and 16,480 Da, corresponding to 4.0 ± 0.9 peptides/oligomer (Fig. 3I). These results are in close agreement with those obtained by size-exclusion chromatography (22Eckenberg R. Rose T. Moreau J.-L. Weil R. Gesbert F. Dubois S. Tello D. Bossus M. Gras H. Tartar A. Bertoglio J. Chouaib S. Goldberg M. Jacques Y. Alzari P.M. Thèze J. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and therefore confirm that the p1–30 tetramer has a compact conformation. As shown in Fig. 3H and reported in Table I, the p10–30 peptide forms a tetramer at 150 μm by associating two dimers with a Kd of 88 μm, and this may explain is biological activity. p1–10, p5–15, p1–22, and p20–30 are dimers at 150 μm with Kd of 50, 113, 65, and 42 μm, respectively, and they remain inactive. The 10–30 sequence of p1–30 could be responsible for the association of four monomers folded to form helix bundles as proposed by the analysis of circular dichroism experiments, whereas the 1–10 sequence might be responsible for the tetramer dimerization that forms the octameric species. The concentration dependence of helix formation and tetramerization is strongly correlated. The association of four p1–30 peptides stabilizes their helices probably within the 10–30 residue range. It is noteworthy that p20–30 and p1–22, which form β-strands, sediment as dimers (Fig. 3, B and Q, and Table II), but only p20–30 exhibits biological activity.Table IISecondary and quaternary structure of IL-2Rβ in solutionSolutions300 nm490 nmp1-31C-Flc3.5 kDa, T/O, Kd = 55 × 10-6 MIL-2Rβ23.3 kDa, M/D, Kd = 3 × 10-6 MIL-2Rβ2·p1-30423.3 kDa, M/D, Kd = 3 × 10-6 MIL2-R β2·p1-31C-Flc23.3 kDa, M/D, Kd = 3 × 10-6 M3.5 kDa, T/O, Kd = 55 × 10-6 M Open table in a new tab Analysis of IL2-Rβ Dimerization—The weight of the IL-2Rβ31–230 molecular species was further studied by analytical ultra"
