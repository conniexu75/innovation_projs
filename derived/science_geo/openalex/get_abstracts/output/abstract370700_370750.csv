https://openalex.org/W2076949647,Amine scrubbing has been used to separate carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from natural gas and hydrogen since 1930. It is a robust technology and is ready to be tested and used on a larger scale for CO 2 capture from coal-fired power plants. The minimum work requirement to separate CO 2 from coal-fired flue gas and compress CO 2 to 150 bar is 0.11 megawatt-hours per metric ton of CO 2 . Process and solvent improvements should reduce the energy consumption to 0.2 megawatt-hour per ton of CO 2 . Other advanced technologies will not provide energy-efficient or timely solutions to CO 2 emission from conventional coal-fired power plants.
https://openalex.org/W2136939531,"The capture of carbon dioxide at the point of emission from coal- or gas-burning power plants is an attractive route to reducing carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. To commercialize carbon capture, as well as transport of liquified carbon dioxide and its storage in exploited oil fields or saline formations, many technological, commercial, and political hurdles remain to be overcome. Urgent action is required if carbon capture and storage is to play a large role in limiting climate change."

The factors regulating this process are only partly understood. Abeta aggregation is a concentration-dependent process that is likely responsive to changes in brain interstitial fluid (ISF) levels of Abeta. Using in vivo microdialysis in mice, we found that the amount of ISF Abeta correlated with wakefulness. The amount of ISF Abeta also significantly increased during acute sleep deprivation and during orexin infusion, but decreased with infusion of a dual orexin receptor antagonist. Chronic sleep restriction significantly increased, and a dual orexin receptor antagonist decreased, Abeta plaque formation in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Thus, the sleep-wake cycle and orexin may play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."

For nonreducable oxides such as aluminum oxide, it is not so obvious how the metal can bind strongly. Kwak et al. (p. 1670 ) used a combination of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and solid-state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance to study the anchoring of platinum at high and low loadings on alumina. At the surface, the Al 3+ ions were penta-coordinated. Density functional calculations support a model in which the cation binds three oxygen atoms in the alumina and two from platinum oxide."

In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency (<5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate.

This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate. Attention has long been known to improve our ability to detect and discriminate the features of sensory stimuli (James, 1890James W. The Principles of Psychology. Henry Holt & Co., New York1890Crossref Google Scholar). One factor that contributes to this improvement in sensory processing is an attention-dependent increase in the mean firing rates of neurons driven by an attended stimulus and associated reductions in the firing rates of neurons driven by task-irrelevant stimuli (for recent reviews, see Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, Knudsen, 2007Knudsen E.I. Fundamental components of attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2007; 30: 57-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In addition to mean firing rate, a key factor determining the fidelity of neural signals is response variability. Even under the most controlled stimulus conditions, identically repeated sensory stimuli evoke neural responses that vary from trial to trial (Softky and Koch, 1993Softky W.R. Koch C. The highly irregular firing of cortical cells is inconsistent with temporal integration of random EPSPs.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 334-350PubMed Google Scholar, Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. The variable discharge of cortical neurons: implications for connectivity, computation, and information coding.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3870-3896PubMed Google Scholar). Response variability affects how reliably information is encoded by neuronal signals (Parker and Newsome, 1998Parker A.J. Newsome W.T.

Spatio-temporal correlations and visual signaling in a complete neuronal population.Nature. 2008; 454: 995-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). An attention-dependent reduction in response variability could, therefore, significantly enhance sensory processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. Consistent with this, the variability of individual neurons is strongly reduced when spatial attention is directed toward the stimulus within the neuron's receptive field (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). The potential benefits of attention-dependent reductions in response variability depend critically on the degree to which the sources of variability are correlated across the population. Uncorrelated sources of response variability can, in principle, be mitigated by pooling signals across a neural population, with noise approaching zero when signals are pooled over a sufficiently large number of neurons. Thus, if the response variability that is diminished by attention (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) were independent across neurons, attention-dependent reductions of this variability might yield only a modest improvement in signal quality. This is not the case with variability that is shared across neurons. Such correlated variability cannot be abolished simply by pooling over a large neural population (Britten et al., 1992Britten K.H.

Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Uncorrelated noise, unique to each neuron's response, can arise from variability in synaptic transmission that is amplified by the threshold nonlinearity in spike generation (Calvin and Stevens, 1967Calvin W.H.

Correlated activity results from shared inputs (Moore et al., 1970Moore G.P. Segundo J.P. Perkel D.H. Levitan H. Statistical signs of synaptic interaction in neurons.Biophys.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Shared variability is evidenced by correlations in firing between pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons. Previous studies have found significant correlations between neurons in visual cortex (Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3661-3673Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Correlations are not limited to local populations but persist even between neurons separated as much as 10 mm in cortex (Smith and Kohn, 2008Smith M.A. Kohn A. Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12591-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, Nauhaus et al., 2009Nauhaus I. Busse L. Carandini I. Ringach D.L. Stimulus contrast modulates functional connectivity in visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 70-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Thus, fluctuations may be shared over very large neuronal populations including many thousands of cells. Because they are shared among many neurons, correlated fluctuations quickly would dominate as the source of noise in pooled measures of neuronal activity (Chen et al., 2006Chen Y. Geisler W.S. Seidemann E. Optimal decoding of correlated neural population responses in the primate visual cortex.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 1412-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and, depending on how information is read-out from populations, could impose severe limits on the accuracy of information represented (Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). It is thus important to determine whether attention decorrelates response variability that is shared across the population. We recorded the responses of neurons in area V4, an intermediate stage of visual processing that has previously been found to be modulated by attention, in two macaques as they performed the attention-demanding tracking task depicted in Figure 1. Using this task, we could direct attention toward or away from a stimulus that we positioned within the neurons' receptive fields (Figure 1). We presented the same visual stimulus on all trials, providing a large number of identical stimulus repetitions from which to estimate variability in the neuronal response. On each trial, the stimulus paused and remained within the region of receptive field overlap for a period of 1000 ms, enabling us to estimate fluctuations in firing rate over a relatively long time period. Because the stimulus was constant during this period, the variability in firing reflects response fluctuations internal to cortex rather than stimulus-induced variability. As previously reported (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), we find that the spiking response of individual neurons was highly variable to repeated stimuli and that attention reduces this variability. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the responses of a single V4 neuron to 48 presentations of the identical stimulus. This neuron exhibited a robust response to the stimulus, which persisted through the pause period, until the stimulus left the receptive field. The raster plot at the top of the figure shows the neuron's response to this stimulus, on trials sorted according to whether attention was directed toward the stimulus in the receptive field (“Attended,” top) or was instead directed away from the receptive field (“Ignored,” middle). The left vertical yellow line indicates when the stimulus paused after entering the receptive field. The right yellow line shows the end of the 1000 ms pause period, when the stimulus initiated movement out of the receptive field. We characterized neuronal response variability with reference to the variability expected of a Poisson process, in which each spike occurs with a fixed probability that is independent of the neuron's spiking history. For a homogenous Poisson process, the variance of the number of spikes within a fixed time interval is equal to the mean spike count in that interval. The Fano factor (F), the ratio of spike count variance to mean spike count, is therefore 1 for a Poisson process. We computed the Fano factor in each of the attention conditions, over 100 ms time windows. As shown in the lower panel, Fano factor tended to be >1 for unattended responses (shown in blue), indicating response variability greater than would be expected for a Poisson process. We focused our analysis on the last 800 ms of the sustained period, during which the firing rate was relatively stable and free of response transients due to the stimulus entering the receptive field. When attention was directed into the receptive field, the Fano factor was significantly reduced (permutation test, p < 0.0001). Across the 191 neurons, there was a significant median reduction of Fano factor of 8.8% (Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001) with 42 units showing individually significant modulation (p < 0.05, permutation test), all of which were reductions (see population average in Figure 5A). We examined whether this response variability reflected independent fluctuations in the responses of individual neurons or instead represents a source of correlated noise that is shared across the network. To assess this, we undertook two types of analyses. First, we computed the coherence between spikes from pairs of separate isolated units recorded simultaneously in the same session. The spike-to-spike coherence provides a frequency-resolved measure of the degree to which fluctuations in spiking in one unit are correlated with fluctuations in spiking of a second neuron. It is sensitive only to fluctuations in firing rate that occur within the duration of a single trial (<800 ms). The spike-to-spike coherence is shown in Figure 3A, for the same unit presented in Figure 2 paired with a simultaneously recorded neuron. The upper line, blue, shows the coherence (±1 SEM) when attention was directed away from the stimulus in the neuron's receptive field. The red line shows coherence with attention directed into the receptive field. In order to show the level of coherence that would be expected by chance, we randomly shuffled the trial-by-trial records of the second unit and computed coherence between the resulting random permutations of spiking responses (dashed lines). The attended and unattended coherence values both exceeded the level to be expected by chance across frequencies below 5 Hz, coinciding with the strong peak in the coherence. This indicates that attention reduced the degree to which low-frequency fluctuations in the neuron's spiking were correlated with fluctuations in the activity of the other neuron. We find that this attention-dependent reduction in low-frequency coherence was common across our recordings. We measured the percentage change in coherence at the peak below 5 Hz for each pair. Across 236 neuron pairs (69 recorded on a single electrode, 167 recorded on separate electrodes), there was a median percentage reduction of 22.6%, and overall values were significantly reduced (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001). Among the 18 pairs that showed individually significant changes in coherence over frequencies <5 Hz, all exhibited reductions. A reduction in low-frequency correlated activity is also evident in the data shown in Figure 3B, which shows correlations in spike counts for the neuronal pair used to compute the coherence in 3A. Correlation coefficients were computed based on the spike counts of the two neurons across trials in simultaneous counting intervals. The upper line (blue) was derived from data recorded when attention was directed away from the receptive field, the lower line (red) from trials when attention was directed into the receptive field. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that response variability is correlated across neurons (Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T.

Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 3012-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), as indicated by values above zero (horizontal black line). To assess the time scale of correlations, we computed correlations using different sized counting windows (Bair et al., 2001Bair W. Zohary E. Newsome W.T. Correlated firing in Macaque visual area MT: time scales and relationship to behavior.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1676-1697PubMed Google Scholar, Smith and Kohn, 2008Smith M.A. Kohn A. Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12591-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Consistent with these studies, we find that the correlation coefficient grows larger with counting interval, indicating that correlations predominantly reflect low-frequency rate fluctuations. The correlations were reduced when attention was directed into the receptive field. The average spike-to-spike coherence across all 236 neuron pairs (175 recorded from monkey M and 61 from monkey B) is shown in Figure 4A for attended (red) and unattended (blue) trials. Consistent with the individual neurons whose responses are shown in Figure 3, we find that the coherence in spiking is significantly reduced over frequencies below 20 Hz when attention is directed into the neuronal receptive field. Consistent with the pair of neurons shown in Figure 3, the strongest reductions were found below 5 Hz, for both monkeys (monkey M, 175 pairs: median reduction 26.5%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001; monkey B, 61 pairs: median reduction 14.3%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.05). Consistent with this low-frequency coherence, the average correlation in spiking between pairs increases with longer timescales, as seen in Figure 4B. We find that correlations in spiking averaged between counting windows from 30 to 300 ms are significantly reduced with attention directed into the receptive field in one monkey and marginally reduced in a second animal that had fewer pairs (monkey M, 175 pairs: median reduction 39.3%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001; monkey B, 61 pairs: median reduction 49.9%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p = 0.062). The distribution of correlations for attended and ignored conditions is shown for a single counting window of 100 ms in Figure 4C for the two animals (monkey M in green, monkey B in black). Whereas coherence is computed within trials, correlation is computed from spike counts across different trials. Therefore, correlation is potentially sensitive not only to fluctuations occurring within a trial but also to fluctuations on much longer timescales that span multiple trial epochs. However, across our population, we find that correlation saturates near 100 ms (Figure 4B), and further, there is little effect when we factor out changes in rate that occur over intervals longer than 800 ms (see Experimental Procedures). This is consistent with earlier studies that have reported correlations between pairs of neurons that saturate at counting windows around 30–300 ms (Bair et al., 2001Bair W. Zohary E. Newsome W.T. Correlated firing in Macaque visual area MT: time scales and relationship to behavior.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1676-1697PubMed Google Scholar, Smith and Kohn, 2008Smith M.A. Kohn A. Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 12591-12603Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We analyzed separately the 69 neuron pairs that were recorded on a single electrode and the 167 pairs that were recorded on separate electrodes. Both sets showed significant reductions in correlation and coherence with attention (see Figure S1). Previous studies have suggested that correlations in firing severely limit the quality of information represented by neuronal populations (Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Shadlen and Newsome, 1998Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. The variable discharge of cortical neurons: implications for connectivity, computation, and information coding.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3870-3896PubMed Google Scholar). We evaluated how these attention-dependent reductions in correlated firing might impact the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of pooled neuronal signals (Figure 4D). If neuronal fluctuations were uncorrelated, then their impact could be diminished to any desired extent by pooling over a sufficiently large population of neurons, resulting in an arbitrarily large SNR (black line). Correlations limit the benefit of pooling by imposing an upper asymptote on SNR as a function of the size of the neuronal pool. To quantify the potential limits imposed by the degree of correlations we observed in our unattended responses, we calculated SNR as a function of the number of neurons in the pool, assuming the mean level of correlation we observed in our unattended trials (r = 0.068 at a counting window of 100 ms). This leads to the level of saturation in the SNR shown in the blue line (see Zohary et al., 1994Zohary E. Shadlen M.N. Newsome W.T. Correlated neuronal discharge rate and its implications for psychophysical performance.Nature. 1994; 370: 140-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, Figure 3 for details). To measure the benefits of attention-dependent reductions in correlated firing, we repeated the calculation using the mean correlation we observed on attended trials (r = 0.034 at 100 ms windows). This resulted in a 39% improvement in the asymptotic SNR (red line). We next compared this to the improvement attributable to attention-dependent increases in firing rate. In line with previous studies finding that attention increases responses (Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) we find that attention increased firing rate by an average of 20%. This increase in rate, with no corresponding change in correlations of firing, would cause only a 9.5% change in the SNR (orange line). Thus, given the simplest pooling strategy, the observed reductions in correlated firing would improve signal quality by more than four times the improvement attributable to attention-dependent increases in firing rate. Next, we quantified the time course of attention-dependent reductions in correlation and coherence. Figure 5 shows the results of this analysis. Figure 5A shows the Fano factor for attended stimuli (red line) and unattended stimuli (blue line), averaged over the population. The vertical yellow lines show the pause period. As reported earlier (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), attention significantly reduced individual neuron's response variability, as measured by the Fano factor during last 800 ms of the pause period. Panels (B)–(G) show correlations and coherence computed across successive 400 ms time windows centered on the early, middle, and late parts of the pause period. The first of these windows began 200 ms before the stimulus paused, so it covered the initial response that occurred as the stimulus swept into the receptive field. As noted earlier (Mitchell et al., 2007Mitchell J.F. Sundberg K.A. Reynolds J.H. Differential attention-dependent response modulation across cell classes in macaque visual area V4.Neuron. 2007; 55: 131-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar), the Fano factor in both attention conditions is reduced during this initial response period. This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis finding reductions in Fano factor in many brain areas during the transient response that follows stimulus onset (M. Churchland et al., 2009, Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, conference abstract 92). The second and third windows cover the next two successive 400 ms periods, which together constitute the 800 ms sustained period analyzed in Figure 3, Figure 4. These two windows each showed clear correlation that was significantly reduced by attention. Panels (B) and (E) show that correlations and coherence are reduced in this early period, as compared to the later sustained period (panels C and D, F and G). Even though the overall Fano factor, correlations, and coherence during the early period were reduced relative to the later sustained response that was the focus of our study, the correlation in the early period was still significantly reduced by attention. Thus, while it is stronger during the sustained response, the attention-dependent reduction in correlation holds throughout the stimulus-evoked response. We next considered if small fixational eye movements present during task performance could contribute to the correlations in firing and corresponding attention-dependent reductions. Because eye movements displace the stimulus on the retina, they can act as an external source of stimulus-induced variability for visual neurons. Fixational eye movements have been shown to increase the variability of individual neuron's firing in primary visual cortex (Gur et al., 1997Gur M. Beylin A. Snodderly D.M. Response variability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkeys.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2914-2920PubMed Google Scholar, Gur et al., 1999Gur M. Beylin A. Snodderly D.M.

High response reliability of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of alert, trained monkeys.Cereb. Cortex. 2006; 16: 888-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and a previous study in visual area V4 also indicates that modulations in rate due to eye movements can be substantial (Leopold and Logothetis, 1998Leopold D.A. Logothetis N.K. Microsaccades differentially modulate neural activity in the striate and extrastriate visual cortex.Exp. Brain Res. 1998; 123: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Another study, however, found small eye movements could not account for the slow timescale correlations observed in extrastriate area MT in perceptual decision tasks (Bair and O'Keefe, 1998Bair W.

Moreover, ROI analyses have largely been based on heuristic definitions of the morphology of specific cell types (Gobel et al., 2007Gobel W. Kampa B.M. Helmchen F.

Thus, current analyses are prone to crosstalk in the signals extracted from adjacent cells and surrounding neuropil. The present mismatch between the capabilities for Ca2+ imaging and those for analyzing the data restricts the capacity to attain biological insights. This situation partly resembles that of the early 1990s, when multielectrode techniques were blossoming but standardized spike-sorting algorithms had yet to arise. Today, automated spike sorting is widely used to assign spikes to individual cells (Fee et al., 1996Fee M.S. Mitra P.P. Kleinfeld D.

Methods. 1996; 69: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, Lewicki, 1998Lewicki M.S.

Santhanam G. Yu B.M. Ryu S.I. Afshar A. Shenoy K.V. Reference frames for reach planning in macaque dorsal premotor cortex.J.

Multineuronal codes in retinal signaling.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1996; 93: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). An automated procedure for extracting cellular Ca2+ signals would be a similar enabler of scientific progress. However, the challenges in devising such a procedure are distinct from those in spike sorting. Spike-sorting routines tend to rely on two basic ideas. First, the temporal waveforms for spikes from different cells are often sufficiently dissimilar to provide a basis for spike classification. Second, the activity of individual cells is often recorded on multiple electrodes, aiding assignment of spikes based on their relative amplitudes on different recording channels. Neither approach works well for imaging data. First, Ca2+ activity waveforms are strongly dictated by intracellular Ca2+ buffering and the dye's binding kinetics (Helmchen et al., 1996Helmchen F. Imoto K. Sakmann B. Ca2+ buffering and action potential-evoked Ca2+ signaling in dendrites of pyramidal neurons.Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1069-1081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), which do not provide strong signatures of individual cells' identities. Second, single-image pixels can contain a complex mixture of signals from neuropil, neurons, astrocytes, and noise. It is nontrivial to disentangle these signals without suffering crosstalk and to find the shapes and locations of each cell. A guiding principle is needed to help extract cells' locations and activities. We formulated such a principle by considering the manner in which intracellular [Ca2+] transiently rises above background levels during cellular events such as action potentials. Brief periods of elevated [Ca2+] are typically sparsely interspersed among many more background-dominated time frames. Sparseness also holds in the spatial domain if each cell occupies only a small subset of pixels. Thus, Ca2+ signals' sparseness should be a general attribute that is quantifiable by simple measures, such as the skewness of amplitude distributions. This reasoning led us to an algorithm that estimates cells' locations and activities by parsing data into a combination of statistically independent signals, each with a high sparseness. The algorithm requires no preconceptions of cells' appearances and little user supervision, and it relies on an independent component analysis (ICA) (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995Bell A.J. Sejnowski T.J.

Independent component analysis of high-resolution imaging data identifies distinct functional domains.Neuroimage. 2007; 34: 94-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Figure 1). ICA has been used previously for analyses of electroencephalography (EEG) (Makeig et al., 1997Makeig S. Jung T.P. Bell A.J. Ghahremani D. Sejnowski T.J.

Eng. 2007; 54: 436-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Beckmann and Smith, 2004Beckmann C.F. Smith S.M.

Brain Mapp. 1998; 6: 160-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1519) Google Scholar) data, but a challenge has concerned the physiological interpretation of the identified sources, which can be mixtures of signals from different recording channels or brain areas. We reasoned that for ICA analyses of Ca2+ imaging data, such interpretative issues should be much reduced, since cells' properties can be corroborated by other experimental means, including in the same animals examined by imaging. In studies of human brain activity, corroborative data were much harder to obtain in living subjects. We validated our method using simulated movies mimicking Ca2+ imaging data acquired in cerebellar cortex. Our sorting procedure provided superior signal estimates and lower susceptibility to crosstalk than reconstructions done by ROI analysis. We also tested our analysis on data recorded by two-photon microscopy in the cerebellar cortex of awake behaving mice, from which we extracted Ca2+ signals of up to >100 total Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia. To illustrate our method's utility, we applied it to study the spatiotemporal organization of Purkinje cells' Ca2+ spiking activity in behaving mice. We found that synchronously active cells cluster into neighborhoods ∼7–18 cells across in the mediolateral dimension. We identify these as cerebellar microzones, small patches of Purkinje cells receiving similar climbing fiber input (Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978Andersson G. Oscarsson O. Climbing fiber microzones in cerebellar vermis and their projection to different groups of cells in the lateral vestibular nucleus.Exp. Brain Res. 1978; 32: 565-579PubMed Google Scholar). Our data revealed that microzones of awake animals have sharply delineated mediolateral boundaries, to a precision of about a single cell. We addressed the longstanding question of whether microzones have stable anatomical boundaries (Andersson and Oscarsson, 1978Andersson G. Oscarsson O. Climbing fiber microzones in cerebellar vermis and their projection to different groups of cells in the lateral vestibular nucleus.Exp. Brain Res. 1978; 32: 565-579PubMed Google Scholar) or are dynamic entities whose cellular constituents vary across behavioral states (Lang et al., 1999Lang E.J. Sugihara I. Welsh J.P. Llinas R. Patterns of spontaneous purkinje cell complex spike activity in the awake rat.J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2728-2739PubMed Google Scholar, Welsh et al., 1995Welsh J.P. Lang E.J. Suglhara I. Llinas R. Dynamic organization of motor control within the olivocerebellar system.Nature. 1995; 374: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). We found that during mouse locomotion microzones' spatial organization was unchanged from that in awake but resting animals, consistent with the idea that microzones are stationary anatomical units. These findings reveal basic features of cerebellar dynamics and highlight the impact of automated procedures for analyzing imaging data. The purpose of cell sorting is to identify spatial filters and corresponding time traces that represent the locations and dynamics of individual cells (Figure 1A). Our procedure does this in four stages (Figure 1B and Supplemental Software Toolbox). Physiological signals are buried in high-dimensional data that might contain, e.g., Nx ∼105 pixels and Nt ∼104 time frames. A first stage of analysis should reduce this dimensionality, since specifying cells' spatial filters and activities would otherwise require a large set of parameters. In principle, these parameters could be found, but tuning many parameters can hamper signal extraction (Hastie et al., 2001Hastie T. Tibshirani R. Friedman J.H. The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction. Springer, New York2001Crossref Google Scholar). For dimensional reduction, we used an established method, principal component analysis (PCA) (Table S1), to find and discard dimensions that mainly encoded noise (Mitra and Pesaran, 1999Mitra P.P. Pesaran B. Analysis of dynamic brain imaging data.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 691-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Other means of dimensional reduction might also be suitable (Discussion). PCA identifies a linear transformation of the data yielding basis vectors, the principal components, which are rank ordered by the variance of signals along each basis vector. Truncation of the highest-ranked components with the smallest variances often does not interfere with an approximate reconstruction of the data. On the contrary, if ongoing background noise has smaller variance than transient but strong signals, then removing higher-order components from the data can eliminate substantial noise. In our studies of cerebellum, after identifying the noise floor and truncating principal components representing noise (Figure S1) (Mitra and Pesaran, 1999Mitra P.P. Pesaran B. Analysis of dynamic brain imaging data.Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 691-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), we achieved a reduced dimensionality, K, much less than Nx or Nt. However, PCA alone cannot isolate Ca2+ signals from individual cells. PCA by itself is ill suited for cell sorting since it relies on differences in variance to identify data components; in practice, time variations in different cells' fluorescence signals tend to be of similar amplitude. Thus, each principal component generally has a mix of signals from multiple cells. Instead, one seeks a set of signal sources reflecting individual cells. The expectation is that such sources should be localized, with a sparse or skewed spatial distribution of pixel weights for each cell, such that most pixels have almost no weight but a few are strongly weighted at the cell's location. Skewness, a distribution's third moment normalized by the cube of the standard deviation, provides a means of characterizing sparseness and searching for statistical signatures of individual cells. Similarly, if the intervals between cells' brief rises in [Ca2+] are greater than their durations, the distributions of signals' amplitudes will also be sparse and skewed (Discussion). These expectations motivated our application of ICA following PCA. ICA is suited to extracting cellular signals since it seeks pairs of spatial filters and time traces that are sparse and statistically independent of one another. In practice, we found that cells can exhibit significant signal correlations and ICA will still work well, even for cell pairs with moderately high correlation coefficients. We used a version of the FastICA algorithm that maximizes the sparseness of extracted signals (Hyvarinen and Oja, 2000Hyvarinen A. Oja E. Independent component analysis: algorithms and applications.Neural Netw. 2000; 13: 411-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (5748) Google Scholar), which we expressed by a combination of spatial and temporal skewness (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). We examined the sparseness of Ca2+ signals recorded by two-photon microscopy in the cerebellar vermis of awake, head-restrained mice (Figure 2). We used multi-cell bolus loading of the Ca2+ indicator Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1-AM to label neurons and astrocytes in the cerebellar molecular layer (Nimmerjahn et al., 2009Nimmerjahn A. Mukamel E.A.

Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The mice stood on an exercise ball and could walk or run at liberty during imaging (Dombeck et al., 2007Dombeck D.A. Khabbaz A.N. Collman F. Adelman T.L. Tank D.W.

This permitted recording of the dendritic Ca2+ spikes associated with complex (Na+ and Ca2+) action potentials in Purkinje cells (Flusberg et al., 2008Flusberg B.A. Nimmerjahn A. Cocker E.D. Mukamel E.A. Barretto R.P. Ko T.H. Burns L.D. Jung J.C. Schnitzer M.J. High-speed, miniaturized fluorescence microscopy in freely moving mice.Nat.

Identification and clustering of event patterns from in vivo multiphoton optical recordings of neuronal ensembles.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also observed Ca2+ activation in Bergmann glial fibers (Nimmerjahn et al., 2009Nimmerjahn A. Mukamel E.A. Schnitzer M.J. Motor behavior activates Bergmann glial networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 400-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Application of PCA to the data yielded principal components that were generally not spatially localized and failed to isolate cells' activities (Figures 2A and 2B, top row). Distributions of signal values along the principal-component vectors were highly symmetric and approximately Gaussian (Figure 2C, right) and did not separate Ca2+ transients from background noise. ICA transformed these components into new basis vectors with more distinctive properties. A majority of independent components had spatial filters far more localized than those of principal components and could reasonably represent individual cells (Figures 2A and 2B, bottom row). Spatial filters found by ICA had skewed distributions (4.4 ± 2.7, mean skewness ± SD, n = 300 independent components in 5 mice, versus −0.009 ± 0.26 for 504 principal components), with the weights of small subsets of pixels up to 19 standard deviations greater than background pixels (Figure 2C, left). Many filters resembled a stripe in the rostral-caudal direction, with the long axis perpendicular to the folium of the cerebellar cortex (Figure 2A). This is the expected optical cross-section through the dendritic tree of a single Purkinje cell, since these cells have nearly planar dendritic trees lying perpendicular to the field of view (Flusberg et al., 2008Flusberg B.A. Nimmerjahn A.

The stripes' widths (7.0 ± 2.3 μm, mean ± SD; n = 199 dendrites in 5 mice) and lengths (90 ± 40 μm) as estimated by twice the standard deviations of Gaussian fits were consistent with values derived anatomically (Llinas et al., 2004Llinas R.R.

Mukamel E.A. Barretto R.P. Ko T.H. Burns L.D. Jung J.C. Schnitzer M.J. High-speed, miniaturized fluorescence microscopy in freely moving mice.Nat.

In the temporal domain, Ca2+ activity traces of the independent components also had sparse statistics. Signal distributions were asymmetric and non-Gaussian, with sparse sets of time frames during which fluorescence signals rose by up to eight standard deviations (Figure 2C, right). For the striped independent components representing Purkinje cell dendritic trees, the time traces yielded Ca2+ spike rates and waveforms similar to those from prior manual or semiautomated analyses of cerebellar Ca2+ imaging data (Flusberg et al., 2008Flusberg B.A. Nimmerjahn A. Cocker E.D. Mukamel E.A. Barretto R.P. Ko T.H. Burns L.D. Jung J.C. Schnitzer M.J. High-speed, miniaturized fluorescence microscopy in freely moving mice.Nat.

Identification and clustering of event patterns from in vivo multiphoton optical recordings of neuronal ensembles.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). After verifying the sparseness of signals found by ICA, we examined their independence by plotting joint distributions of signals from pairs of components, each representing one Purkinje cell. The data of Figure 2D (bottom) is typical of 276 pairs we studied. In most time frames, signals were close to background levels. Each cell was active during a subset of time frames, but the subsets for the two cells were distinct, unlike with pairs of principal components (Figure 2D, top). Only a small number of time frames had high signal amplitudes in both cells, consistent with the cells' activities being statistically independent. We did encounter some cell pairs whose activity was sufficiently correlated that the pair was extracted as a single independent component. We handled these instances in the third stage of our analysis (see below). Interestingly, the skewness often provided a means for distinguishing components representing individual cells from those representing artifacts, such as due to brain motion. Nearly all independent components in experimental data had higher spatial skewness than principal components (Figure 2E). Among the independent components, those we recognized by eye to be Purkinje cell or Bergmann glial signals, based on our prior studies of these cells (Flusberg et al., 2008Flusberg B.A. Nimmerjahn A. Cocker E.D. Mukamel E.A. Barretto R.P. Ko T.H. Burns L.D. Jung J.C. Schnitzer M.J. High-speed, miniaturized fluorescence microscopy in freely moving mice.Nat.

Motor behavior activates Bergmann glial networks.Neuron. 2009; 62: 400-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), generally had higher temporal skewness than those representing noise or artifacts (Figure 2E). After sorting independent components by their temporal skewness, it was usually quick and straightforward to segregate and reject artifactual components by inspection. Alternatively, signal components could often be isolated via automated clustering of signals according to their skewness (Figures 2E and S1). To be conservative, we regularly examined spatial filters and time traces visually before accepting them as cellular signals. When we inspected components with high skewness, we found several types of signals in our cerebellar recordings. Prominent signals extracted by ICA were those from one, sometimes two, and occasionally three or more of the striped regions that we interpreted to be cross-sections of the corresponding number of Purkinje cell dendritic trees (Figures 2A, 4, and 5). Signals from these stripes exhibited brief increases in fluorescence (<50 ms rise), followed by an approximately exponential decay with time constant 124 ± 63 ms (mean ± SD, n = 150 cells in 5 mice). In awake mice, these events occurred at a spontaneous rate of 0.76 ± 0.15 Hz (n = 199 cells in 5 mice) when the mice were not moving on the exercise ball. These rates were determined by performing a temporal deconvolution on the time traces to account for the Ca2+ indicator's kinetics, followed by a threshold operation for spike detection (Figure 1B) (Yaksi and Friedrich, 2006Yaksi E. Friedrich R.W. Reconstruction of firing rate changes across neuronal populations by temporally deconvolved Ca2+ imaging.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 377-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The rates are consistent with those from physiological recordings of complex spiking (Lang et al., 1999Lang E.J. Sugihara I. Welsh J.P. Llinas R.

https://openalex.org/W2086238474,"The need to sleep grows with the duration of wakefulness and dissipates with time spent asleep, a process called sleep homeostasis. What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells, and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly, we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here, we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness, periods of population activity (ON) are short, frequent, and associated with synchronous firing, while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep, firing rates and synchrony decrease, while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus, the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep."

Individual sensory neurons in mice express only one of 1500 different receptor genes (Buck and Axel, 1991Buck L. Axel R.

Thus, a transformation in the representation of olfactory information is apparent in the bulb where the randomly distributed population of active neurons in the sense organ is consolidated into a discrete spatial map of glomerular activity. What is the nature of the representation in the bulb and in the next olfactory processing center, the piriform cortex? In the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems, spatial information in the peripheral sense organs is maintained in the sensory cortex (Woolsey and Walzl, 1942Woolsey C.N. Walzl E.M.

In these sensory neocortices, cells responsive to similar stimulus features are clustered, and response properties vary smoothly across the cortex. In the olfactory bulb, imaging experiments reveal that different odorants elicit distinct spatial patterns of glomerular activity (Rubin and Katz, 1999Rubin B.D. Katz L.C.

These studies reveal a coarse chemotopic representation; glomeruli responsive to structurally similar odorants are spatially segregated within domains, but within these domains glomeruli with differing odorant specificities are interspersed. The representation of odorants in the piriform has been examined by electrophysiological recordings, imaging of intrinsic signals, and analysis of odorant evoked Fos gene expression (Rennaker et al., 2007Rennaker R.L.

Odor representations in olfactory cortex: “Sparse” coding, global inhibition, and oscillations.Neuron. 2009; 62: 850-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The mitral and tufted cells, the output neurons of the bulb, extend an apical dendrite into a single glomerulus and project axons to several telencephalic areas and provide significant input onto pyramidal neurons of the piriform cortex (Price and Powell, 1970Price J.L. Powell T.P.S. The mitral and short axon cells of the olfactory bulb.J. Cell Sci. 1970; 7: 631-691PubMed Google Scholar). Mitral cell axons synapse with dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer 1 of piriform, a three-layered paleocortex. Electrophysiological recordings of individual pyramidal cells at several positions in the anterior piriform cortex reveal cells responsive to a given odorant distributed across the cortex (Rennaker et al., 2007Rennaker R.L. Chen C.-F.F. Ruyle A.M. Sloan A.M. Wilson D.A. Spatial and temporal distribution of odorant-evoked activity in the piriform cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1534-1542Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, efforts to examine the spatial structure of cortical activity in the piriform cortex by recording a small number of widely separated cells may not permit the detection of patterned neural activity. More extensive sampling of cortical activity derives from analysis of Fos gene expression (Illig and Haberly, 2003Illig K.R. Haberly L.B. Odor-evoked activity is spatially distributed in piriform cortex.J. Comp. Neurol. 2003; 457: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that cells responsive to an odorant are dispersed without obvious spatial pattern, but Fos imaging permits detection of the response of cells to only a single odorant and depends upon an interpretation of the source of the Fos signal. We have therefore visualized odorant representations in piriform by optically recording the responses of large populations of neurons across the cortex at single-cell resolution. These studies reveal that the piriform does not exhibit a pattern of neural activity in which cells respond to a given odorant with great selectivity. Rather, the specificity of an odorant appears to be represented by unique and distributed ensembles of neurons that no longer display the coarse chemotopy or spatially segregated patterns of neural activity observed in the olfactory bulb. This representation suggests organizational principles that differ from those in neocortical sensory areas where cells with similar receptive fields are clustered and tuning varies smoothly across the cortex. These data suggest a model in which connections from bulb to cortex involve random, convergent, excitatory inputs to piriform cells, a feature that may render the piriform a purely associative cortex. We have developed procedures that permit the recording of odorant-evoked changes in fluorescence intensity in neurons of the piriform cortex in mice by two-photon microscopy (Denk et al., 1990Denk W. Strickler J.H. Webb W.W. Two-photon laser scanning fluorescence microscopy.Science. 1990; 248: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (7798) Google Scholar). The piriform cortex is a three-layered structure on the ventral lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere (Figure 1A). The major projection neurons of the piriform cortex, the pyramidal cells, locate their cell bodies in layers 2 and 3 and extend apical dendrites to layer 1 where they synapse with mitral cell afferents from the olfactory bulb (Figure 1B). A surgical procedure was developed to expose the ventral surface of the temporal lobe, rendering the piriform cortex optically accessible to two-photon microscopy. Piriform neurons were loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye, Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM, by injection of dye into broad regions of layer 1 (Stosiek et al., 2003Stosiek C. Garaschuk O. Holthoff K. Konnerth A. In vivo two-photon imaging of neuronal networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, Ohki et al., 2005Ohki K. Chung S. Ch'ng Y.H. Kara P. Reid R.C. Functional imaging with cellular resolution reveals precise microarchitecture in visual cortex.Nature. 2005; 433: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar). This bulk-loading technique led to the efficient uptake of dye by the dendrites and the labeling of greater than 90% of the pyramidal cell bodies in layers 2 and 3 across wide regions of the piriform cortex (Figure 1C). This preparation maintains the integrity of the olfactory system and reveals odorant-evoked changes in fluorescence intensity in pyramidal cells for as long as 12 hr. We imaged odorant responses at multiple sites in over 100 animals. We present typical examples that illustrate the features of odorant-evoked responses in the piriform. We have analyzed responses in multiple animals to determine the variability of these features. Stimulation consisted of a 1 s puff of odorant in diluted concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 80 ppm in air. Prestimulation images acquired upon exposure to air were used to calculate the baseline fluorescence of labeled pyramidal cells. Responses reflect a cell-based analysis of aligned images corrected for movement (Figures S1 and S2). Exposure to 20 different odorants, at concentrations from 0.5 to 80 ppm, elicited fluorescence changes in 3%–15% of the piriform neurons (Figures 1D and 1E). Each odorant activated a unique ensemble of cells in layer 2 (Figure 1D). The frequency of responding cells differed for different odorants but was consistent for each odorant across multiple fields in different animals. When presented at 3 ppm, for example, octanal activated 10.2% of the labeled piriform cells (±1.1 SEM, n = 14 animals; for c = 16967 cells in f = 45 imaging fields), whereas α-pinene activated 6.5% (±1.0 SEM, n = 6, c = 9297, f = 21) and benzaldehyde activated only 3.3% (±0.8 SEM, n = 3, c = 2982, f = 10) of the piriform cells. Odorant-evoked responses in fields of ∼300 cells were consistent across multiple trials: on average, a cell responsive to a given odorant was activated in over 80% of 15 trials (Figures 2 and S3). This consistency is similar to calcium responses measured in rodent visual cortex but much greater than the variable responses recently observed in barrel cortex (Ohki et al., 2005Ohki K. Chung S. Ch'ng Y.H. Kara P. Reid R.C. Functional imaging with cellular resolution reveals precise microarchitecture in visual cortex.Nature. 2005; 433: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, Kerr et al., 2007Kerr J.N.D. de Kock C.P.J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13316-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Moreover, the responses were eliminated by blockade with the glutamate antagonists, CNQX and APV, indicating that the observed responses were synaptically mediated (Figure S4). Cells responsive to a given odorant within the same imaging field exhibited a range of statistically significant positive responses, with ΔF/F values between 2% and 50%. In a field of 300 cells in which 55 neurons responded to one of six odorants, 47 cells exhibited a ΔF/F below 10%, whereas eight cells exhibited a ΔF/F from 10%–40% (Figures 2A and 2C). This skewed distribution of response intensities could reflect different levels of convergent input from active mitral cells, a property that could follow an exponential distribution consistent with our data. The response to increasing odorant concentrations in the piriform was subadditive and saturating. As the octanal concentration was increased from 3 to 80 ppm, the frequency of responsive cells approached saturation at a value of 20% active cells. At 3 ppm, 10% of the cells were activated, and this value only increased to 20% at 25-fold higher odorant concentrations (Figure 3). Most cells exhibited subadditive increases in intensity with increasing odorant concentration, but one-third of the cells exhibited a decline in activity at higher concentration. The presence of a population of cells that exhibited diminished response intensities as odorant concentration was increased suggests that suppression accompanies increases in activity, a conclusion further supported by experiments with odorant mixes (see below). Each odorant activated a population of from 3% to 15% of the neurons in layer 2 of the piriform cortex. The responses of individual cells could be resolved, and adjacent cells responsive to different odorants were readily distinguished (Figures 1C and 1E). Within a single imaging field, cells responsive to a given odorant were dispersed rather than clustered, and cells responding to different odorants were therefore intermingled. Cells adjacent to an octanal-responsive neuron, for example, were equally likely to respond to 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT, an aversive fox odorant) or female mouse urine (an attractive odorant) as they were to octanal (Figures 1C–1E). No spatial clustering of neurons responsive to a given odorant could be discerned within localized imaging fields. Each odorant activated a distinct ensemble of cortical neurons. Individual cells within the ensemble could respond to multiple structurally dissimilar odorants. 12.8% of the cells responsive to octanal, for example, were also responsive to α-pinene (±2.7 SEM, n = 6 animals), and about 9.0% of octanal-responsive cells also responded to butyric acid (±1.3 SEM, n = 3; Figures 4A and 4B). A given neuron in piriform cortex responded to multiple dissimilar odorants and therefore exhibited what might be called a “discontinuous” receptive field. These observations imply that the identity of an odorant cannot be determined by the activity of an individual neuron. Rather, an odorant is likely to be represented by an ensemble of active neurons that is unique to an individual odorant. The distinct representations of structurally dissimilar odorants in cortex presumably reflect the observation that these odorants activate largely nonoverlapping sets of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. However, structurally similar odorants such as octanal and hexanal, for example, activate glomerular populations with over 70% overlap (Meister and Bonhoeffer, 2001Meister M. Bonhoeffer T. Tuning and topography in an odor map on the rat olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1351-1360PubMed Google Scholar). In the piriform cortex, the patterns of active neurons elicited by these odorants exhibited 26.6% overlap (±2.0 SEM, n = 7; Figures 4C and 4D). This value is greater than the 5%–15% overlap typically observed between structurally distinct odorants but is far less than the overlap between the set of hexanal- and octanal-responsive glomeruli described in the bulb (Meister and Bonhoeffer, 2001Meister M. Bonhoeffer T. Tuning and topography in an odor map on the rat olfactory bulb.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1351-1360PubMed Google Scholar). The extent of overlap between the representations of two odorants will change depending upon where the threshold is set, an inherent problem in imaging experiments. Increasing the threshold diminishes overlap, whereas lowering the response threshold increases overlap. The overlap between octanal and hexanal is not large even at low thresholds that maximize overlap. Thus, the overlapping representations of structurally similar odorants observed in the bulb are decorrelated in piriform cortex. We also observed a small subset of cells that responded to the majority of odorants tested. In a typical experiment, in a given field of cortical neurons exposed to five structurally distinct odorants, about 35% of the neurons responded to at least one odorant, and only 2% of the neurons responded to four or five of the odorants (Figure 4B). The frequency of cells that responded promiscuously to multiple odorants was consistent across several imaged fields. These neurons may have input characteristics different from the vast majority of the responding piriform cells. A given odorant activates a spatially stereotyped population of glomeruli in the olfactory bulb (Rubin and Katz, 1999Rubin B.D. Katz L.C.

Superimposed upon this invariant insular map is a coarse chemotopy such that structurally similar odorants often activate glomeruli in circumscribed regions of the olfactory bulb (Lin et al., 2006Lin D.Y.

We imaged multiple overlapping fields to survey large areas of both the anterior and posterior piriform cortex to determine whether different odorants activated spatially segregated populations of cortical neurons. Imaging was performed on similar regions of piriform cortex in different individuals using the middle cerebral artery and the lateral olfactory tract as anatomic landmarks (Figure 5A). Optical recordings were obtained with 16 structurally diverse odorants across overlapping fields of 300 cells in about 100 animals. We present typical examples of this analysis in Figures 5 and S5–S8. Cells responsive to a given odorant were distributed throughout the entire imaged fields without evidence for segregation, with only incidental clustering that was not replicated across animals (Figure 5C). We found a similar distribution of responsive cells for each of 16 structurally distinct odorants independent of imaging location in piriform. These results are in accord with our observations upon imaging single fields and reveal the intermingling of cells responsive to different odorants. The representations of odorants displayed no reliable patterning on a large (1 mm) or small (100 μm) spatial scale. No consistent patches of responsive cells or gradients in the density of responsive cells were observed across the imaged regions stretching 3 mm and encompassing as much as 20% of the piriform's area and 50% of its length. The density of responsive cells in the representation of a given odorant could vary 2- to 3-fold across spatial scales of hundred of microns (Figures 5C and S6–S8). Monte Carlo simulation in which we randomly distribute the same number of responsive cells on the same locations yielded similar results (Figure S9). However, autocorrelation analysis of the representations of individual odorants and cross-correlation analysis of the representations of different odorants revealed no periodic patterning that was consistent across animals (Figure S10). The distribution of responsive cells across the piriform does not change when we consider only the highest responding cells (ΔF/F > 5%; Figure S11). There was likewise no evidence for a graded spatial distribution of cells responsive to an odorant, a finding inconsistent with a rostral-caudal gradient of odorant responses reported for intrinsic imaging of the guinea pig piriform (Sugai et al., 2005Sugai T. Miyazawa T. Fukuda M. Yoshimura H. Onada N. Odor-concentration coding in the guinea pig piriform cortex.Neuroscience. 2005; 130: 769-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The behavioral relevance of odorants also does not appear to be regionally mapped in piriform since cells responsive to two odorants that elicit opposing behaviors (mouse urine and a component of fox excretions, TMT) were intermingled. Thus, neither the spatially segregated patterns of active glomeruli nor the associated chemotopy observed in the olfactory bulb were found in the distributive odorant representations in piriform cortex. The absence of discernible patterning suggests the possibility that the cells' responsive to a given odorant may be randomly distributed in the piriform cortex. Pyramidal neurons are thought to integrate convergent mitral cell input from multiple glomeruli onto individual pyramidal cells. This model predicts that exposure to a mix of two odorants will result in the activation of a significant subset of pyramidal neurons that are not activated by the individual components of the mix. Alternatively, if pyramidal neurons receive input from only a single glomerulus, the representation of an odorant mix should reflect the combined representations of the component odorants presented separately. We therefore exposed mice to either octanal, α-pinene, or hexanal alone or in pair-wise mixes and imaged across multiple fields in the piriform cortex (Figure 6). 20%–40% (average = 32.3% ± 3.7% SEM, n = 5 animals) of the neurons responsive to a mix did not respond to either of the individual components, a finding consistent with the convergence of inputs from multiple glomeruli (Figure 6A). However, the responses of the cells active only with a mix was on average weak (ΔF/F below 10%); this population did not include the subset of strong responses (ΔF/F above 10%) that were consistently observed with component odorants. The most prominent feature observed with a mix was suppression. 40%–60% of the cells responsive to the individual components failed to respond to a mix of these components (average = 50.0% ± 3.5% SEM, n = 5 animals). In a field of 1039 cells in which 188 responded to octanal or α-pinene alone, we observed that only 120 responded upon exposure to the mix (Figure 6A). This suppression was observed for pair-wise combinations of structurally similar (octanal/hexanal) and dissimilar (octanal/pinene; octanal/ethyl methyl sulfide, data not shown) odorants. Moreover, suppression was not only reflected by the cells that responded to components and not to the mix but also by diminished responses in those cells that remained active to the mix (Figures 6B–6D). The extent of synergy or suppression a cell exhibited with a mix does not correlate with the magnitude of its response to a single component. The observed suppression was not specific. α-pinene elicited an excitatory response in 4% of the piriform cells when presented alone, yet elicited suppression in over 90% of the octanal-responsive cells when presented in a mix. Thus, the representation of a mix of odorants in piriform retains features of the representations of the components and exhibits a small synergistic collection of cells, but its most prominent feature is strong, nonspecific inhibition. Olfactory perception is initiated by the recognition of odorants by a large repertoire of receptors in the sensory epithelium. Distributed neural activity in the nose is converted into a segregated, coarse chemotopic map in the olfactory bulb. This transformation results from the convergence of like axons, each bearing the same receptor, on a given glomerulus. This organization combines the robustness of a redundant, spatially unbiased sampling system in the nose with the economy of a condensed spatial representation in the olfactory bulb. Optical imaging"
https://openalex.org/W2112180451,"Recent studies have used fMRI signals from early visual areas to reconstruct simple geometric patterns. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian decoder that uses fMRI signals from early and anterior visual areas to reconstruct complex natural images. Our decoder combines three elements: a structural encoding model that characterizes responses in early visual areas, a semantic encoding model that characterizes responses in anterior visual areas, and prior information about the structure and semantic content of natural images. By combining all these elements, the decoder produces reconstructions that accurately reflect both the spatial structure and semantic category of the objects contained in the observed natural image. Our results show that prior information has a substantial effect on the quality of natural image reconstructions. We also demonstrate that much of the variance in the responses of anterior visual areas to complex natural images is explained by the semantic category of the image alone."

To explore the role of small regulatory RNAs in learning-related synaptic plasticity, we carried out massive parallel sequencing to profile the small RNAs of Aplysia californica. We identified 170 distinct miRNAs, 13 of which were novel and specific to Aplysia. Nine miRNAs were brain enriched, and several of these were rapidly downregulated by transient exposure to serotonin, a modulatory neurotransmitter released during learning. Further characterization of the brain-enriched miRNAs revealed that miR-124, the most abundant and well-conserved brain-specific miRNA, was exclusively present presynaptically in a sensory-motor synapse where it constrains serotonin-induced synaptic facilitation through regulation of the transcriptional factor CREB. We therefore present direct evidence that a modulatory neurotransmitter important for learning can regulate the levels of small RNAs and present a role for miR-124 in long-term plasticity of synapses in the mature nervous system.

An extensive class of small RNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans.Science. 2001; 294: 862-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2217) Google Scholar) and the resulting functional studies revealed that miRNAs control many other cellular functions, including proliferation, metabolism, apoptosis, immunity, and, more recently, neuronal growth and plasticity. To obtain a more complete inventory of small RNAs that may have a role in learning-related synaptic plasticity, we used a large-scale identification approach to mine and functionally screen the small RNAs of the marine snail Aplysia. The large, stereotyped, easily identifiable neurons of Aplysia make it a practical choice for studying the distribution and function of small RNAs at the resolution of single cells and single synapses. Critical components of the neural circuitry of the Aplysia gill-withdrawal reflex can be reconstituted in cell culture, allowing for a well-controlled study of axonal growth, synapse formation, stabilization, and synaptic plasticity. The evolutionary closeness of Aplysia to vertebrates and mammals also makes Aplysia generally attractive as a model system for addressing the function of small RNAs (Moroz et al., 2006Moroz L.L. Edwards J.R. Puthanveettil S.V. Kohn A.B. Ha T. Heyland A. Knudsen B. Sahni A. Yu F. Liu L. et al.Neuronal transcriptome of aplysia: neuronal compartments and circuitry.Cell. 2006; 127: 1453-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In Aplysia, both short-term memory lasting minutes and long-term memory lasting days have been well characterized in the gill-withdrawal reflex in response to sensitization, a simple form of learned fear (reviewed in Kandel, 2001Kandel E.R. The molecular biology of memory storage: a dialogue between genes and synapses.Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar). In an Aplysia sensory-motor culture system (Montarolo et al., 1986Montarolo P.G. Goelet P. Castellucci V.F. Morgan J. Kandel E.R. Schacher S. A critical period for macromolecular synthesis in long-term heterosynaptic facilitation in Aplysia.Science. 1986; 234: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar), delivery of one pulse of serotonin (5HT), a modulatory neurotransmitter released in the intact animal by sensitizing stimuli, elicits PKA-dependent short-term facilitation lasting minutes. By contrast, five spaced pulses of serotonin cause both PKA and MAPK to translocate to the nucleus (Martin et al., 1997Martin K.C. Michael D. Rose J.C. Barad M. Casadio A. Zhu H. Kandel E.R. MAP kinase translocates into the nucleus of the presynaptic cell and is required for long-term facilitation in Aplysia.Neuron. 1997; 18: 899-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholarb), thereby releasing inhibition by the repressor CREB2 and activating CREB-dependent transcription, leading to long-term synaptic facilitation and growth of new synaptic connections. Thus, in sensitization, as in many other forms of learning, nuclear activation of CREB is an important component of a general switch that converts short-term into long-term plasticity in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Dash et al., 1990Dash P.K.

In addition, studies on both the gill-withdrawal reflex and the mammalian hippocampus has delineated the importance of local protein synthesis at the synapse in sustaining synapse activity independent from the distant cell body (reviewed by Sutton and Schuman, 2006Sutton M.A. Schuman E.M.

RNA trafficking and local protein synthesis in dendrites: an overview.J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 7131-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Indeed, communication between the nucleus and the synapse, via the shuttling of mRNA and proteins by kinesin motors, serves as still another critical regulatory point in the induction of long-term facilitation (Puthanveettil et al., 2008Puthanveettil S.V.

Since the spatiotemporal regulation of learning-related synaptic plasticity is extensive and complex, miRNAs appear well-suited to serve as negative regulators. The ability of miRNAs to selectively (Farh et al., 2005Farh K.K. Grimson A. Jan C. Lewis B.P. Johnston W.K. Lim L.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P.

Moreover, their ability to form autoregulatory loops (Rybak et al., 2008Rybak A. Fuchs H. Smirnova L. Brandt C. Pohl E.E. Nitsch R. Wulczyn F.G. A feedback loop comprising lin-28 and let-7 controls pre-let-7 maturation during neural stem-cell commitment.Nat.

A microRNA controlling left/right neuronal asymmetry in Caenorhabditis elegans.Nature. 2003; 426: 845-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) suggests their potential involvement in either homeostatic or switch-like events during various phases of synaptic plasticity, an inherently multistable phenomenon. Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of brain-specific miRNAs in synapse formation and of miRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (miRNPs) in controlling local protein synthesis associated with stable memory (reviewed in Schratt, 2009Schratt G. Fine-tuning neural gene expression with microRNAs.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2009; 19: 213-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These findings have encouraged us to explore systematically the miRNA population of the Aplysia central nervous system to understand their functions during learning-related synaptic plasticity. We identified small RNAs in neuronal and nonneuronal cell populations in Aplysia that allowed the identification of brain-enriched miRNAs. We have functionally characterized the most highly abundant, well-conserved, brain-specific miRNA: Aplysia miR-124. This miRNA is specific to the presynaptic sensory neuron where it is rapidly downregulated by serotonin. In the absence of serotonin regulation, miR-124 provides an inhibitory constraint on synaptic plasticity and long-term facilitation through the regulation of CREB, the transcriptional switch critical for converting short- to long-term facilitation. We prepared small RNA cDNA libraries from isolated central nervous system (CNS) and from the whole animal with CNS removed. Within the CNS, we also generated small RNA libraries from dissected abdominal and pleural ganglia. The libraries from the whole animals and CNS were sequenced using 454 sequencing technology yielding a total of about 250,000 sequence-reads for each library. The abdominal and pleural libraries were sequenced by traditional Sanger sequencing until ∼2000 reads were collected for each library. Because we lacked an assembled genome, we first built an Aplysia-specific annotation database to distinguish miRNAs from turnover of abundant and conserved noncoding RNAs such as rRNAs, tRNAs, or snRNAs. The total content of rRNAs, tRNAs, and snRNAs taken together varied between 5% and 25% per library (Table S1). To be considered a miRNA, the residual sequences needed to satisfy the following three criteria. (1) Precise 5′ end processing: length variants of members of a sequence family preferentially aligned to the 5′ end. (2) Fold-back precursor structure: a fold-back structure had to be identified comprising a genomic fragment retrieved from unassembled trace archives. (3) Cloning of the miR∗ sequence: since double-stranded miR/miR∗ processing intermediates are assembled in an asymmetric fashion, capture of miR∗ that generates short 3′ overhangs when paired to the mature miRNA is further evidence for prototypical miRNA biogenesis. The Aplysia genome trace sequence archives do not yet cover the full Aplysia genome. We therefore considered certain clone sequences that did not map to trace sequences as miRNAs, if we could map them to miRNA precursors annotated in other species. We identified 170 distinct miRNAs in Aplysia, of which 157 were orthologs to known miRNAs in other species and 13 were specific to Aplysia. The new discoveries are cataloged in Table 1. All miRNAs are cataloged in Table S2. Sixty sequences that were abundantly cloned and that demonstrated good 5′ processing but that were neither conserved nor mapped were designated miRNA candidates (Table S3). The evidence for each miRNA is summarized in Table S4. The overall abundance of miRNAs in the small RNA libraries ranged from 50% to 80%, consistent with the miRNA content in small RNA libraries prepared from other species (Aravin et al., 2003Aravin A.A.

The predominantly cloned sequence is given along with the number of sequence reads, including its predominant length variants and an indication of whether the star sequence was (+) or was not (−) cloned. A phylogenetic analysis of the Aplysia transcriptome revealed that Aplysia is closer in evolutionary distance to the vertebrates than are C. elegans and D. melanogaster (Moroz et al., 2006Moroz L.L. Edwards J.R. Puthanveettil S.V. Kohn A.B. Ha T. Heyland A. Knudsen B. Sahni A. Yu F. Liu L. et al.Neuronal transcriptome of aplysia: neuronal compartments and circuitry.Cell. 2006; 127: 1453-1467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We similarly find that Aplysia miRNAs more closely resemble vertebrate miRNAs both in sequence similarity of individual genes and in the abundance of shared miRNA genes. We grouped the 170 distinct Aplysia miRNAs into 103 miRNA gene families based primarily on seed sequence similarity (Table S5), of which 41 families are conserved specifically in vertebrates, whereas only 13 map specifically to invertebrates (Figure 1A). When we fit the observed miRNA gene gains and losses onto various phylogenetic trees, we find that our data best fit a model where Aplysia is a very ancient ancestor to the invertebrates, lies outside the D. melanogaster/C. elegans clade, and more directly straddles the invertebrate and vertebrate lineages (Figure 1B). The orthology relationships used to construct the phylogeny are given in Table S6. A salient feature in support of this model is the presence of 46 miRNAs that are preserved from vertebrates to Aplysia but subsequently lost in D. melanogaster and C. elegans (Figure 1B). Taken together, these findings illustrate that Aplysia miRNAs are ancient and well conserved, with relatively few losses or gains of genes, which makes it a distinctive model organism among invertebrates that shares important genomic similarities with vertebrates and mammals. We observe one striking aspect of evolutionary history regarding the miR-9/79 gene family. The invertebrate-specific miR-79 and the vertebrate- and Drosophila-specific miR-9 are expressed in equal proportions in Aplysia and are in fact star sequences of each other, found on opposite strands of the same precursor hairpin (Figure 1C). It is likely, then, that Aplysia mir-9/79 is a single gene that displays symmetric maturation patterns for both strands, whereas in other species, the gene has duplicated to give rise to multiple gene copies with asymmetric strand preference producing either miR-79 in other invertebrates or miR-9 in vertebrates. Deep sequencing revealed the expression of over 100 distinct miRNA genes expressed in the Aplysia CNS. The miRNAs comprising the top 95% of clones are shown in order of their abundance in Figure 2 with their enrichment in the CNS versus the rest of the body. Nine miRNAs are either brain specific or brain enriched by cloning (Figure 2, and confirmed with northern blotting in Figure 3A), three of which are miRNAs unique to Aplysia. In general, there was good overlap of the miRNAs of Aplysia CNS with the miRNAs of the human and rodent brain, but notable exceptions include the high abundance and brain enrichment of miR-22c (Figure 3A), miR-184 (Figure 3A), miR-34b, and miR-190, where studies in other species have not found CNS enrichment for these miRNAs (Chen et al., 2005Chen P.Y.

The multicopy cistrons of miR-1/133a and miR-206/133b, which are muscle specific in vertebrates and D. melanogaster, were abundantly expressed in Aplysia CNS. Finally, the low expression of miR-9 and the complete absence of miR-128 in Aplysia CNS are noteworthy because both are highly abundant and brain-specific in vertebrates.Figure 3Characterization of miRNA Tissue and Cell Specificity and Subcellular DistributionShow full caption(A) Northern blots showing the expression of eight different mature miRNAs across various tissues including (p) hepatopancreas, (m) muscle, (h) heart, (ot) ovotestis, and (cns) central nervous system. 20 μg of total RNA was loaded in each lane (except in the case of miR-100001, where 40 μg of total RNA was loaded due to difficulty detecting signal).

To learn which miRNAs might function in a compartment-specific manner, we developed a protocol (described in Experimental Procedures) for in situ hybridization of miRNAs in Aplysia using synthetic DNA probes. We dissected a functional circuit containing a sensory and motor neuron from Aplysia ganglia, placed them in coculture, and examined the in situ hybridization patterns for various miRNAs (Table 2). We found that miR-124 stained much more intensely in the sensory neuron compared with the motor neuron (Figure 3B), and a 4 nt mismatch containing control probe showed no signal. We also consistently observed both a perinuclear density for mir-124, as well as punctuate staining in the processes (Figure 3C). Further in situ hybridization studies of the more abundant miRNAs in CNS revealed several other miRNAs (such as miRs 22c, 125c, let-7a, 100, and 8b) that were specifically expressed in the sensory neuron compared to the motor neuron (Figure 3B) and some that were enriched in either the cell body alone (miR-1) or in the neurite processes alone (miR-100001) (Figure 3C). The differential expression of miRNAs between sensory and motor neurons is also apparent from miRNA clone frequencies of abdominal versus pleural ganglia, the latter of which contain many more sensory neurons.Table 2Summary of miRNA Expression Patterns in an Aplysia Sensory-Motor Coculture as Assessed by in Situ HybridizationNumber of Reads (CNS)CNS EnrichmentSensory NeuronMotor NeuronCell BodyCell ProcessmiR-12488,678+++++miR-30728,561+++miR-125c24,803+++miR-22c20,405++++let-7a17,452+++miR-18412,629+++++miR-1000018,690+++++miR-16,593+++miR-2b6,128++++miR-1005,339+++miR-8b4,040+++miR-1532,951++++++For each miRNA, the table indicates whether it was enriched (++), present (+), or absent () in the cell types and compartments listed.

We therefore asked: might miR-124 be regulated by synaptic activity? Specifically, we wanted to know whether it might be modulated by serotonin, a neurotransmitter important for learning. We found, by northern analysis, that already within 1 hr of exposure to five spaced pulses of serotonin the levels of miR-124 were consistently reduced by 2-fold (Figure 4A). These findings were corroborated by in situ hybridization analysis, which also showed a drop in miR-124 levels in both the sensory neuron cell body and neurite processes within 1 hr after washout from five pulses of serotonin (Figure 4B). No change in miR-124 levels was observed in cells treated with just one pulse of serotonin (Figure S1). To determine how long it takes for miR-124 levels to return to baseline after exposure to five pulses of 5HT, we performed a time course analysis and found that miR-124 levels continue to drop even 2 hr after 5HT treatment, but then slowly reaccumulate, returning to baseline by 12 hr (Figure 4C). To better understand the mechanism underlying the serotonin-induced regulation of miR-124, we tested whether the miR-124 precursor levels were also affected by 5HT and found by real-time PCR that pre-miR-124 levels remained unaffected in sensory neurons after exposure to five pulses of 5HT (Figure 4D). This indicated that the regulation of miR-124 occurs downstream to the biogenesis of the precursor species, either at the level of the RNase III Drosha processing or turnover of the Argonaute-bound miRNA complex. Since 5HT is known to activate several downstream signaling pathways, including PKA (Castellucci et al., 1980Castellucci V.F. Kandel E.R. Schwartz J.H. Wilson F.D. Nairn A.C. Greengard P.

By analyzing recent infrared mapping by Chandrayaan-1 and Deep Impact, and reexamining Cassini data obtained during its early flyby of the Moon, Pieters et al. (p. 568 , published online 24 September), Sunshine et al. (p. 565 , published online 24 September), and Clark et al.

Some variability in water abundance is seen over the course of the lunar day. The data imply that solar wind is depositing and/or somehow forming water and OH in minerals near the lunar surface, and that this trapped water is dynamic."
https://openalex.org/W2154138127,Data from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on Cassini during its flyby of the Moon in 1999 show a broad absorption at 3 micrometers due to adsorbed water and near 2.8 micrometers attributed to hydroxyl in the sunlit surface on the Moon. The amounts of water indicated in the spectra depend on the type of mixing and the grain sizes in the rocks and soils but could be 10 to 1000 parts per million and locally higher. Water in the polar regions may be water that has migrated to the colder environments there. Trace hydroxyl is observed in the anorthositic highlands at lower latitudes.

https://openalex.org/W2067961999,"Disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a susceptibility gene for major mental illnesses, regulates multiple aspects of embryonic and adult neurogenesis. Here, we show that DISC1 suppression in newborn neurons of the adult hippocampus leads to overactivated signaling of AKT, another schizophrenia susceptibility gene. Mechanistically, DISC1 directly interacts with KIAA1212, an AKT binding partner that enhances AKT signaling in the absence of DISC1, and DISC1 binding to KIAA1212 prevents AKT activation in vitro. Functionally, multiple genetic manipulations to enhance AKT signaling in adult-born neurons in vivo exhibit similar defects as DISC1 suppression in neuronal development that can be rescued by pharmacological inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an AKT downstream effector. Our study identifies the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway as a critical DISC1 target in regulating neuronal development and provides a framework for understanding how multiple susceptibility genes may functionally converge onto a common pathway in contributing to the etiology of certain psychiatric disorders."

Near-infrared spectra of the largest example confirm this composition, and repeated imaging showed fading over several months, as expected for sublimating ice. Thermal models of one site show that millimeters of sublimation occurred during this fading period, indicating clean ice rather than ice in soil pores. Our derived ice-table depths are consistent with models using higher long-term average atmospheric water vapor content than present values. Craters at most of these sites may have excavated completely through this clean ice, probing the ice table to previously unsampled depths of meters and revealing substantial heterogeneity in the vertical distribution of the ice itself."

The larvae are transported back to European waters by the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift. However, details of the spawning migration remain unknown because tracking eels in the Atlantic Ocean has, so far, eluded study. Recent advances in satellite tracking enable investigation of migratory behavior of large ocean-dwelling animals. However, sizes of available tags have precluded tracking smaller animals like European eels. Here, we present information about the swimming direction, depth, and migratory behavior of European eels during spawning migration, based on a miniaturized pop-up satellite archival transmitter. Although the tagging experiment fell short of revealing the full migration to the Sargasso Sea, the data covered the first 1300 km and provided unique insights."

Surprisingly little, however, is understood about how we acquire and deploy concepts. Here, we show that a functionally coupled circuit involving the hippocampus and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC) underpins the emergence of conceptual knowledge and its effect on choice behavior. Critically, the hippocampus alone supported the efficient transfer of knowledge to a perceptually novel setting. These findings provide compelling evidence that the hippocampus supports conceptual learning through the networking of discrete memories and reveal the nature of its interaction with downstream valuation modules such as the vMPFC. Our study offers neurobiological insights into the remarkable capacity of humans to discover the conceptual structure of related experiences and use this knowledge to solve exacting decision problems."
https://openalex.org/W2138367727,"Intracellular lipid accumulation in the heart is associated with cardiomyopathy, yet the precise role of triglyceride (TG) remains unclear. With exercise, wild type hearts develop physiologic hypertrophy. This was associated with greater TG stores and a marked induction of the TG-synthesizing enzyme diacylglycerol (DAG) acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1). Transgenic overexpression of DGAT1 in the heart using the cardiomyocyte- specific alpha-myosin heavy chain (MHC) promoter led to approximately a doubling of DGAT activity and TG content and reductions of approximately 35% in cardiac ceramide, 26% in DAG, and 20% in free fatty acid levels. Cardiac function assessed by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization was unaffected. These mice were then crossed with animals expressing long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase via the MHC promoter (MHC-ACS), which develop lipotoxic cardiomyopathy. MHC-DGAT1XMHC-ACS double transgenic male mice had improved heart function; fractional shortening increased by 74%, and diastolic function improved compared with MHC-ACS mice. The improvement of heart function correlated with a reduction in cardiac DAG and ceramide and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis but increased fatty acid oxidation. In addition, the survival of the mice was improved. Our study indicates that TG is not likely to be a toxic lipid species directly, but rather it is a feature of physiologic hypertrophy and may serve a cytoprotective role in lipid overload states. Moreover, induction of DGAT1 could be beneficial in the setting of excess heart accumulation of toxic lipids."

Reverse transcription-PCR revealed high expression of atp8a2 mRNA in the retina and testis. Within the retina, immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation studies localized Atp8a2 to outer segment disc membranes of rod and cone photoreceptor cells.

Lipid asymmetry has been implicated in a number of important cellular functions. These include generating tight lipid packing to increase membrane impermeability; establishing the shape of intracellular organelles through membrane; bending; cell division; phagocytosis and cell death; fertilization; vesicle transport and fusion; regulating the functional activity of membrane-associated proteins, including enzymes, receptors, transporters, and channels; and sequestering protein complexes to membrane surfaces (4.Puts C.F.

Although no effect on reproduction was found, there was a significant loss of neural and muscle cells, which could be rescued by deletion of a PS-binding phagocyte receptor. In yeast, a deficiency in the P4-ATPases Drs2 and Dnf3 causes a loss of PE and PS asymmetry and a reduced rate of transport of fluorescent phospholipid derivatives across membranes (3.Alder-Baerens N.

The importance of P4-ATPases is underscored by the finding that mutations in several members of this subfamily of proteins are known to cause severe human disorders.

In earlier biochemical studies, membranes of erythrocytes and bovine chromaffin granules were reported to contain aminophospholipid translocase activity (16.Zachowski A. Henry J.P. Devaux P.F.

PE and PS but not PC derivatives were translocated from the outer to the inner cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane in an ATP-dependent manner. The ATPase implicated in aminophospholipid translocase activity in chromaffin granules has been identified as Atp8a1, a member of the P4-ATPase family (20.Tang X. Halleck M.S. Schlegel R.A. Williamson P. Science. 1996; 272: 1495-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified isoforms of Atp8a1 in murine erythrocytes, suggesting that this member of the P4 ATPase family may also be responsible for aminophospholipid translocase activity in erythrocyte membranes (21.Soupene E. Kuypers F.A. Br. J. Haematol. 2006; 133: 436-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Outer segments are specialized light sensing compartments of rod and cone photoreceptor cells. They consist of a stack of highly organized disc membranes packed with the photopigment protein, rhodopsin, in rod outer segments (ROS) and cone opsin in cone outer segments. Rhodopsin and enzymes involved in the G-protein-mediated visual cascade in ROS have been extensively studied, leading to a comprehensive understanding of phototransduction (22.Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Mutations in the genes encoding many photoreceptor-specific proteins are known to cause inherited retinal degenerative diseases, which are a major cause of blindness in the population (23.Lev S. Cell Mol. Neurobiol. 2001; 21: 575-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24.Pacione L.R. Szego M.J. Ikeda S. Nishina P.M. McInnes R.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 26: 657-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, despite the progress made in understanding phototransduction and retinal degenerative diseases, we still know relatively little about proteins involved in photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis and structure. Furthermore, although phospholipids were reported to be asymmetrically distributed across the disc membrane over 25 years ago, the protein(s) responsible for generating and maintaining this transbilayer asymmetry have not been identified (25.Wu G. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 879-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26.Miljanich G.P. Nemes P.P. White D.L. Dratz E.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1981; 60: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recently, we have carried out a mass spectrometry-based proteomic study designed to identify low abundance membrane and soluble proteins of photoreceptor outer segments with the goal of defining their role in outer segment structure, function, and morphogenesis (27.Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L. Foster L.J. Molday R.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The P4-ATPase Atp8a2 was identified as a membrane protein present in photoreceptor outer segment preparations. atp8a2 has been previously reported to be expressed in the testis as a 4.5-kb mRNA with high levels occurring during early spermatid development (28.Halleck M.S. Lawler Jr., J.F. Blackshaw S. Gao L. Nagarajan P. Hacker C. Pyle S. Newman J.T. Nakanishi Y. Ando H. Weinstock D. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The biochemical properties of this member of the P4-ATPase family, however, have not been investigated to date. To begin to define the role of Atp8a2 in retinal photoreceptors, we have generated several monoclonal antibodies to Atp8a2 and used these immunoreagents to localize, purify, and characterize the functional properties of Atp8a2. Here, we show that Atp8a2 is expressed in the retina as well as testes and is present in outer segment disc membranes of rod and cone photoreceptors. Importantly, we have purified Atp8a2 from disc membranes by immunoaffinity chromatography for analysis of its aminophospholipid-dependent ATPase and flippase activities. The ATPase activity of Atp8a2 was activated by PS and to a lesser extent PE. Upon reconstitution into lipid vesicles, Atp8a2 was found to flip fluorescent-labeled PS to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, confirming the aminophospholipid translocase activity of Atp8a2. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which a specific P4-ATPase has been directly shown to display flippase activity by functional reconstitution of the purified protein and the first membrane protein linked to phospholipid asymmetry in photoreceptor cells. 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1, 2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (DOPS), brain polar lipids (porcine), l-α-phosphatidylinositol (bovine, liver), 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phosphate, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol, sphingomyelin (porcine, brain), cholesterol (ovine, wool), l-α-phosphatidylcholine (egg, chicken), C6 NBD-PS, C6 NBD-PE, C6 NBD-PC, and C12 NBD-PS were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). ATP and n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside were purchased from Sigma, dithionite was from Fisher, CHAPS was from Anatrace (Maumee, OH), and synthetic 6C11 peptide (Ac-RDRLLKRLS) was purchased from Biomatik (Cambridge, Canada). The Rho 1D4 antibody was obtained from UBC-UILO. Total bovine, human, and murine retinal RNA was isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate phenol chloroform method (29.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63149) Google Scholar). Because the only available sequences for bovine atp8a2 were incomplete, a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed (30.Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4333) Google Scholar). Random primed cDNA was prepared using the RT-PCR Master Mix Kit (GE Healthcare). Full-length human, bovine, and mouse atp8a2 were amplified by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Fermentas, Burlington, Canada). Restriction sites were introduced by PCR. Bovine and mouse atp8a2 were cloned into pcDNA3 and pCEP4 using the BamHI and NotI restriction sites, and human atp8a2 was cloned into pcDNA3 using KpnI and NotI. 1D4-tagged Atp8a2 contained a 9-amino acid C-terminal tag (TETSQVAPA). The sequence of bovine atp8a2 was deposited in GenBank™ (GQ303567). The sequences of human and murine atp8a2 had previously been deposited (NM_015803.2, NM_016529.4). Detection of gene expression using DIG-labeled riboprobes was performed (31.Grayson C. Reid S.N. Ellis J.A. Rutherford A. Sowden J.C. Yates J.R. Farber D.B. Trump D. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with modifications. A fragment was isolated from an EcoRI/HindIII digest of murine atp8a2 and ligated into pcDNA3 (nucleotides 923–1641). Sense and antisense cRNA were made using the DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Applied Science) with the SP6 and T7 polymerases, respectively. Probes were treated with DNase I (Fermentas) and purified by LiCl precipitation. Eyes from 6-month-old BALB/c mice were fixed for 40 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl), frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT, and cut into 12-μm sections. Probes were diluted to 400 ng/ml and incubated with sections for 16 h at 60 °C. Sections were treated with anti-DIG-alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) and developed in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium for 15 h. RNA was isolated from tissues from 6-month-old C57/B6 mice to prepare random primed cDNA. atp8a2 gene expression was measured using the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ACGAGGGACGTGCTCATGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CCTCAAGTGTCACCAGCAGGCT-3′. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used for comparison employing the following forward and reverse primers: 5′-ATCAAATGGGGTGAGGCCGGTG-3′ and 5′-CGGCATCGAAGGTGGAAGAGTG-3′. The primers were annealed at 55 °C, and the PCR was run for 25 cycles using Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs). Fragments corresponding to the C-terminal 103 amino acids and the P-domain (amino acids 371–873) of bovine Atp8a2 were cloned in frame with glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare). Mice were immunized with GST fusion proteins purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Hybridoma cell lines were generated as previously described (32.MacKenzie D. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7100-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and screened for reactivity against Atp8a2 using Western blots of bovine ROS. The epitope for the Atp6C11 monoclonal antibody was identified by measuring its immunoreactivity to synthetic overlapping 9-amino acid peptides spanning the C terminus of Atp8a2 as described previously (33.Illing M. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10303-10310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) in 10 cm dishes were transfected at 30% confluence with 20 μg of Atp8a2–1D4 in pcDNA3 by the calcium phosphate method (34.Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) and harvested 48 h later. For control experiments, cells were transfected with empty pcDNA3. HEK293T membranes were isolated as described (35.Bungert S. Molday L.L. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23539-23546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cryosections of retina tissue from bovine eyes fixed in 4% paraformaldehdye, 100 mm phosphate buffer (PB), pH 7.4, for 1 h were blocked and permeabilized with 10% normal goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PB for 30 min. The sections were then labeled overnight at room temperature with Atp2F6 hybridoma culture fluid diluted 1:3 in PB containing 2.5% normal goat serum and 0.1% Triton X-100. Sections were washed with PB and labeled for 1 h with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig secondary antibody (diluted 1:1000) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear stain. For controls, Atp2F6 was preabsorbed with 20 μg of GST fusion protein for 30 min before the antibody was added to the sections. For double labeling studies, sections were labeled with Atp2F6 and a mixture of cone opsin antibodies (JH 492, JH 455; diluted 1:4000), a kind gift of Jeremy Nathans (36.Wang Y. Macke J.P. Merbs S.L. Zack D.J. Klaunberg B. Bennett J. Gearhart J. Nathans J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 429-440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The sections were labeled with secondary 1:1000 diluted anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 and Alexa-594, respectively. Samples were visualized under a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope. Retina and ROS membranes from frozen bovine retinas were prepared as previously described (27.Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L.

Highly enriched ROS disc membranes were prepared by an immunogold density perturbation procedure (27.Kwok M.C. Holopainen J.M. Molday L.L. Foster L.J. Molday R.S. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1053-1066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified Atp6C11 monoclonal antibody was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose at a concentration of 1.5–2 mg of protein/ml of packed beads as described previously (39.Molday L.L. Cook N.J. Kaupp U.B. Molday R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18690-18695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Atp8a2 was purified by solubilizing 3.5 mg of ROS in 1 ml of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm CHAPS, and 0.5 mg/ml DOPC) containing complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science) for 30 min at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (100,000 × g for 10 min), and the soluble fraction was incubated with Atp6C11-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h. The matrix was washed six times with 500 μl of buffer B (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mg/ml DOPC), and the protein was eluted twice in buffer B containing 0.2 mg/ml of 6C11 peptide at room temperature in 50 μl for 1 h. Atp8a2 was purified from ROS as described above with the following modifications. Atp6C11-Sepharose was washed in buffer B containing 0.75% (w/v) n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside and 0.5 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine instead of CHAPS and DOPC. Purified protein was mixed 1:1 with buffer C (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 10% sucrose, 5 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine) and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the sample was dialyzed against 1 liter of buffer D (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10% sucrose) for ∼20 h with two changes to remove the detergent. Typically 25 ng of Atp8a2 was diluted in 25 μl of buffer E (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm ATP). The concentration of Atp8a2 was determined by comparison with known amounts of bovine serum albumin or with known amounts of Atp8a2 by quantitative Western blots. For ATPase activity assays in detergent, buffer E contained 10 mm CHAPS and 2.5 mg/ml DOPC and the stimulating lipid at the indicated concentration. For ATPase assays of reconstituted Atp8a2, the buffer contained 10% sucrose and a final lipid concentration of 1 mg/ml. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 15–30 min and stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 12% SDS. The concentration of phosphate was determined as described (40.González-Romo P. Sánchez-Nieto S. Gavilanes-Ruíz M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, color was developed for 5 min following the addition of 75 μl of Solution D (6% ascorbic acid, 1% ammonium molybdate in 1 n HCl). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 120 μl Solution E (2% sodium citrate, 2% sodium meta-arsenite, 2% acetic acid) and read at 850 nm in a microplate reader. The amount of phosphate released was determined by comparison with known phosphate concentrations. All data points were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times independently with similar results. Data were analyzed with GraFit 6.0 (Erithacus Software). The dithionite NBD-lipid assay was used as described (41.Eckford P.D. Sharom F.J. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 42.McIntyre J.C. Sleight R.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11819-11827Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 43.Romsicki Y. Sharom F.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6937-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) with modifications. Atp8a2 was purified from 3.5 mg of ROS and reconstituted into 250 μl of liposomes at a lipid concentration of 2.5 mg/ml containing 2.5% (w/w) NBD-lipid. Transport was initiated by mixing 20 μl of reconstituted Atp8a2 with nucleotide in buffer D to 50 μl (final nucleotide concentration 0.5 mm) and incubated at 23 °C for 2.5 min. In some cases, NEM or sodium orthovanadate were also added at a concentration of 5 and 1 mm, respectively. The sample was then diluted to 1 ml in buffer D, transferred to a cuvette (path length 1 cm), and read in a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA) using excitation and emission wavelengths of 478 and 540 nm, respectively, and a slit width of 5 nm. Sodium dithionite prepared in 1 m Tris, pH 10, was added at a final concentration of 2 mm once a base-line fluorescence was achieved. After a stable base line was reached, Triton X-100 was then added to a final concentration of 1%. The percentage of NBD-lipid that was accessible to dithionite treatment was defined as %NBDout and was used to calculate the extent of NBD-lipid transport using the following equation, Percentage of NBD-lipid transport=((%NBDout,trial-%NBDout,control)/(%NBDout,ATP-%NBDout,control))×100(Eq. 1) where control, trial, and ATP represent liposomes treated with AMP-PNP, various nucleotides or inhibitors, and ATP, respectively. All data points were performed in triplicate, and each experiment was repeated independently at least three times. Proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis on 9% polyacrylamide gels and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to Immobilon FL membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 10% methanol, pH 8.3. Membranes were blocked with 1% milk in PBS for 30 min, incubated with culture supernatant diluted in PBS for 40 min, washed stringently with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), incubated for 40 min with secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse conjugated with IR dye 680 (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) diluted 1:20,000 in PBST containing 0.5% milk), and washed with PBST prior to data collection on a LI-COR Odyssey infrared imaging system. The concentrations of various antibody supernatants used in this study for Western blot are given (supplemental Table 1). The expression of atp8a2 mRNA in various tissues of 6-month-old C57/B6 mice was examined by RT-PCR. A 500-bp atp8a2 fragment was detected in retina and testis but not heart, kidney, spleen, liver, brain, or lung (Fig. 1A). Detection in the testis by RT-PCR is in general agreement with earlier studies showing high atp8a2 expression in the testis by Northern blot analysis (28.Halleck M.S. Lawler Jr., J.F. Blackshaw S. Gao L. Nagarajan P. Hacker C. Pyle S. Newman J.T. Nakanishi Y. Ando H. Weinstock D. Williamson P. Schlegel R.A. Physiol. Genomics. 1999; 1: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization using DIG-labeled antisense probes to atp8a2 was carried out to identify cells in the retina that express atp8a2. atp8a2 mRNA expression was detected in photoreceptor cells with the most intense staining observed in the inner segment (IS) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) (Fig. 1B). Weak staining was also detected in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. In control samples, no staining was observed when the sense probe was used. Monoclonal antibodies were generated against GST fusion proteins for use as probes to study the biochemical properties and subcellular localization of Atp8a2. The Atp6C11 antibody was obtained from a mouse immunized with a GST fusion protein comprising the C-terminal 103 amino acids of bovine Atp8a2, and the Atp2F6 antibody was produced from a mouse immunized with a GST fusion protein containing amino acids 371–873 of the P-domain of Atp8a2. The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed on Western blots of expressed bovine 1D4-tagged Atp8a2 (Atp8a2-1D4) and ROS membranes. As shown in Fig. 2, both the Atp6C11 and Atp2F6 antibodies labeled a prominent 130-kDa protein in both transfected HEK293T cells and bovine ROS. The size of the protein was consistent with the molecular mass of ∼132 kDa determined from the amino acid sequence of bovine Atp8a2. The identity of the 130-kDa protein as Atp8a2 was further confirmed on Western blots of atp8a2–1D4-transfected cells labeled with the Rho 1D4 antibody (Fig. 2). In controls, no labeling was observed in membranes from mock-transfected HEK293T cells. The Atp6C11 antibody against bovine Atp8a2 cross-reacted with both human and mouse Atp8a2, whereas the Atp2F6 antibody only labeled the bovine protein (Fig. 2). Mouse Atp8a2 expressed in HEK293T cells appeared less stable than the human and bovine proteins and accordingly showed weaker staining by both the Rho 1D4"

Here, we show that dendrite arborization (da) sensory neurons establish dendritic coverage of the body wall early in Drosophila larval development and then grow in precise proportion to their substrate, the underlying body wall epithelium, as the larva more than triples in length. This phenomenon, referred to as scaling growth of dendrites, requires the function of the microRNA (miRNA) bantam (ban) in the epithelial cells rather than the da neurons themselves. We further show that ban in epithelial cells dampens Akt kinase activity in adjacent neurons to influence dendrite growth. This signaling between epithelial cells and neurons receiving sensory input from the body wall synchronizes their growth to ensure proper dendritic coverage of the receptive field. In addition to establishing dendritic coverage of the receptive field, neurons need to adjust their dendritic arbors to match changes of the receptive field. Here, we show that dendrite arborization (da) sensory neurons establish dendritic coverage of the body wall early in Drosophila larval development and then grow in precise proportion to their substrate, the underlying body wall epithelium, as the larva more than triples in length.

We further show that ban in epithelial cells dampens Akt kinase activity in adjacent neurons to influence dendrite growth. This signaling between epithelial cells and neurons receiving sensory input from the body wall synchronizes their growth to ensure proper dendritic coverage of the receptive field. Animals grow extensively after establishing the body plan and, therefore, face the daunting task of ensuring that growth of individual organs and tissues is coordinated with growth of the animal as a whole. This coordination of growth is particularly striking in the nervous system, where numerous types of neurons and supporting cells form a network that monitors sensory information received throughout an animal's body and transmits signals to various tissues. At the level of a sensory neuron, dendrite arbors must grow along with their receptive field throughout development, a physical scaling process that ensures proportional enlargement of the dendrite arbor as the animal grows. How this scaling of dendrite growth is accomplished to exactly match growth of dendrites and surrounding tissue is an interesting open question of likely general relevance to the ways a neuron coordinates its dendritic field to its changing environment. In the adult brain, the dendritic arbor and its spines are remarkably stable, as revealed by two-photon imaging of pyramidal neurons in the mature olfactory bulb and the visual, auditory, motor, and somatosensory cortices (Holtmaat et al., 2005Holtmaat A.J. Trachtenberg J.T. Wilbrecht L. Shepherd G.M. Zhang X. Knott G.W. Svoboda K.

Early in development, however, dendrites must grow in concert with animal growth to sustain proper connectivity and representation of the field. For example, grasshopper interneurons differentiate embryonically, but their dendrites continue to grow in proportion to overall brain size, maintaining their overall morphology and functional properties, while the brain grows nearly 3-fold in linear dimensions (Bentley and Toroian-Raymond, 1981Bentley D.

Similarly, Manduca MN1 and MN3 motoneuron dendrites grow allometrically with the body as a whole throughout larval development (Truman and Reiss, 1988Truman J.W. Reiss S.E. Hormonal regulation of the shape of identified motoneurons in the moth Manduca sexta.J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 765-775PubMed Google Scholar). In goldfish and zebrafish, retinal ganglion cells increase the diameter of their dendritic arbors proportional to the square root of increased diameter of the growing eye, resulting in increased resolution and accuracy in perception of visual stimulus (Lee and Stevens, 2007Lee S. Stevens C.F. General design principle for scalable neural circuits in a vertebrate retina.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12931-12935Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Finally, mouse lumbar spinal motoneuron dendrites grow roughly in proportion to expansion of the spinal cord over a large portion of postnatal development, preserving the dendrite topology of the motoneurons (Li et al., 2005Li Y. Brewer D. Burke R.E. Ascoli G.A. Developmental changes in spinal motoneuron dendrites in neonatal mice.J. Comp. Neurol. 2005; 483: 304-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). How this proportional growth of dendrites and substrate is coordinated to ensure proper dendrite coverage is largely a mystery. Given the important roles of miRNAs in regulating developmental timing in invertebrates (Pasquinelli and Ruvkun, 2002Pasquinelli A.E. Ruvkun G.

Drosophila let-7 microRNA is required for remodeling of the neuromusculature during metamorphosis.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and the ability of miRNAs to regulate expression of perhaps hundreds of target genes, miRNAs are excellent candidates for temporal regulators of nervous system development. Indeed, a large proportion of vertebrate miRNAs are expressed primarily in the nervous system (Kosik and Krichevsky, 2005Kosik K.S. Krichevsky A.M. The elegance of the microRNAs: a neuronal perspective.Neuron. 2005; 47: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, Krichevsky et al., 2003Krichevsky A.M. King K.S.

A microRNA array reveals extensive regulation of microRNAs during brain development.RNA. 2003; 9: 1274-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar), and mutations in genes required for miRNA processing, such as the RNase III Dicer, affect multiple aspects of nervous system development. For example, zebrafish dicer mutants have obvious defects in nervous system differentiation and function (Giraldez et al., 2005Giraldez A.J. Cinalli R.M. Glasner M.E. Enright A.J. Thomson J.M. Baskerville S. Hammond S.M. Bartel D.P. Schier A.F. MicroRNAs regulate brain morphogenesis in zebrafish.Science. 2005; 308: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). Mutations in dicer or pasha, which are required for miRNA processing, cell-autonomously affect axon and dendrite targeting in Drosophila, indicating that miRNAs regulate wiring specificity (Berdnik et al., 2008Berdnik D. Fan A.P. Potter C.J. Luo L. MicroRNA processing pathway regulates olfactory neuron morphogenesis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1754-1759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Finally, specific miRNAs have been implicated in multiple aspects of neuronal development in mammals, from regulation of neurogenesis to regulation of activity-dependent dendrite development (Gao, 2008Gao F.B. Posttranscriptional control of neuronal development by microRNA networks.Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Here, we report our studies of scaling growth of dendrite arbors in the Drosophila peripheral nervous system (PNS). Dendrites of morphologically distinct classes of da neurons exhibit an early, rapid growth phase to enable dendrite growth to catch up with body growth as dendrites establish receptive field coverage, and a subsequent scaling phase in which dendrites grow in proportion with underlying epithelial cells and the larva as a whole to maintain receptive field coverage. From a screen of growth-defective mutants, we identified the miRNA ban as a potent regulator of dendrite scaling growth in the PNS. In ban mutants, dendrites establish proper receptive field coverage, but dendrite growth fails to synchronize with growth of surrounding tissue, leading to late-stage exuberant dendrite growth. Surprisingly, ban function is not required in neurons for scaling growth of dendrites. Instead, ban function in epithelial cells is sufficient for scaling growth of class IV dendrites. In the absence of ban function, Akt expression and activity are upregulated in neurons, leading to exuberant dendrite growth. Thus, ban regulates signaling between epithelial cells and neurons essential for scaling growth of dendrites. Dendrites of class IV da neurons completely and nonredundantly cover the larval body wall early in larval development, a phenomenon referred to as dendritic tiling (Grueber et al., 2002Grueber W.B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Tiling of the Drosophila epidermis by multidendritic sensory neurons.Development. 2002; 129: 2867-2878PubMed Google Scholar). Once field coverage is established, dendrites continue to branch and lengthen to maintain tiling as larvae grow, providing a sensitive system for analysis of how neurons first establish and later maintain coverage of the receptive field. In this study, we have addressed the question of how late-stage dendrite growth is precisely coordinated with larval growth to maintain proper dendrite coverage of the body wall. To examine this process, we used the pickpocket-EGFP (ppk-EGFP) marker (Grueber et al., 2003bGrueber W.B. Ye B. Moore A.W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Dendrites of distinct classes of Drosophila sensory neurons show different capacities for homotypic repulsion.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) to monitor class IV dendrite growth before and after establishment of tiling. To quantitatively assess dendrite coverage, we have used a metric that we refer to as the coverage index, the ratio of the territory covered by dendrites of a given da neuron, such as the class IV neuron ddaC, to the area of a hemisegment that harbors the da neurons (Figure S1 and Experimental Procedures). Dendrite outgrowth of class IV neurons begins at ∼16 hr After Egg Laying (AEL), with class IV dendrites growing rapidly during late embryonic/early larval stages to tile the body wall between 40 and 48 hr AEL and subsequently maintaining this coverage until dendrites are pruned during metamorphosis (Figures 1A and 1B). Between 48 hr AEL and 120 hr AEL (just prior to metamorphosis), larvae grow nearly 3-fold in length and the dorsal area of class IV receptive fields expands by more than 6-fold (Figures 1C and 1D). Therefore, class IV dendrites grow extensively and this dendrite growth must be precisely coordinated with larval growth in order to maintain proper coverage of the receptive field. Class IV dendrites are located between muscle and epithelial cells. Cell divisions that give rise to larval cells are complete by mid-embryogenesis, and larval growth is achieved by increasing cell size rather than additional proliferation (Edgar and Nijhout, 2003Edgar B.A. Nijhout H.F. Growth and Cell Cycle Control in Drosophila.in: Hall M.N. Raff M. Thomas G. Cell Growth: Control of Cell Size. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 23-84Google Scholar). Thus, all the cells that will comprise the larval body wall musculature and epithelia are in place when dendrite outgrowth begins. To simultaneously visualize growth of class IV dendrites and epithelial cells we used a protein trap line that directs GFP expression in epithelial cells and outlines their borders (Armadillo::GFP, adherens junctions, or Neuroglian::GFP, septate junctions) in combination with ppk-GAL4 driving expression of mCD8-RFP in class IV neurons (Figure 1A). Using these markers, we monitored growth of class IV dendrites and epithelial cells throughout embryonic/larval stages. Epithelial cells grow at a nearly constant rate over the time course (Figure 1E). Likewise, the class IV neuron soma grows at a relatively constant rate. In contrast, the dendrite growth is biphasic. Initially, class IV dendrite growth outpaces growth of epithelial cells and the larva as a whole between 16 hr and 48 hr AEL, the timeframe in which class IV dendrites establish tiling (Figure 1E). Dendrite growth slows as class IV dendrite arbors achieve complete body wall coverage, and from 48 hr to 120 hr AEL class IV dendrites grow in proportion to larval growth at a rate comparable to that of epithelial cells (Figure 1E). We will refer to this late dendrite growth as scaling growth of dendrites (a phenomenon unrelated to synaptic scaling) to reflect the physical scaling of dendrite arbors as they grow precisely in proportion to surrounding cells and the larva as a whole in order to maintain proper coverage of the receptive field. To determine whether scaling growth is a general property of da neurons, we monitored dendrite growth in class I and class III da neurons, two additional morphologically distinct classes of da neurons (Grueber et al., 2002Grueber W.B. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Tiling of the Drosophila epidermis by multidendritic sensory neurons.Development. 2002; 129: 2867-2878PubMed Google Scholar), using the coverage index metric introduced above. Like class IV neurons, dendrites of class I and III neurons rapidly establish coverage of a characteristic region of the body wall and subsequently maintain their coverage by expanding their dendrite arbors in precise proportion to larval growth (Figures 1F and S2). Class III neurons cover their territory in the same timeframe as class IV neurons, first establishing receptive field coverage at about 48 hr AEL. In contrast, class I neurons covered their characteristic territory by 24 hr AEL. Thus, temporally distinct signals may regulate scaling of dendrite growth in class I and class III/IV neurons. Nevertheless, scaling growth of dendrites seems to be a general feature of da neuron development. Based on the fidelity of dendrite coverage in class IV neurons, we focused on these neurons for our studies of dendrite scaling. Our finding that class IV dendrites have a rapid growth phase during establishment of tiling and a scaling phase with slower dendrite growth to maintain tiling suggests that some signal(s) attenuate dendrite growth following establishment of tiling, synchronizing growth of class IV dendritic arbors with growth of surrounding tissue. We therefore set out to characterize the signaling that underlies dendrite scaling. To test the capacity of dendrite scaling, we examined the effects of mutations that alter the dimensions of larvae at different developmental states on class IV dendrite growth. We chose alleles that survive until at least the second larval instar, allowing us to monitor dendrite coverage by class IV neurons at a time when they should have already established tiling. Overall, we screened 35 mutant alleles that cause a range of defects in larval size, shape, and growth rate, and results for a representative subset of these alleles are shown (Figure 2 and Table S1). Notably, class IV dendrites properly covered the receptive field in nearly all of these mutants, accommodating a broad range of receptive field areas (ranging from 10% of wild-type [WT] in chico mutants to 120% of WT in giant [gt] mutants) and shapes (Figures 2B and 2D–2F). Dendrites also scaled properly in mutants defective in developmental rate, for example maintaining proper receptive field coverage in b6-22 mutants that develop slowly and persist as second instar larvae or in broad (br) mutants that persist as third instar larvae for days or even weeks (Figures 2C–2F). Taken together, these results demonstrate the robustness of dendrite scaling growth in class IV neurons. Among the few mutants that had any effect on scaling growth of dendrites, the ban mutant had the most severe dendrite overgrowth phenotype we observed (Figure 2F), with the first sign of larval growth defects at 72 hr AEL (Figure 3A). We reasoned that ban might be required for dendrite scaling but not earlier aspects of dendrite development and focused the remainder of our study on the role of ban in dendrite scaling. Notably, ban encodes a miRNA (Brennecke et al., 2003Brennecke J. Hipfner D.R. Stark A. Russell R.B. Cohen S.M. bantam encodes a developmentally regulated microRNA that controls cell proliferation and regulates the proapoptotic gene hid in Drosophila.Cell. 2003; 113: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar) and might represent a regulatory node for scaling of dendrite growth since miRNAs likely regulate expression of 100 or more target genes (Lim et al., 2005Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs.Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (3786) Google Scholar). Dendrites of individual class IV neurons occupy a larger proportion of the body wall in ban mutant third instar larvae (Figures 2F, 3B, and 3D). At 96 hr AEL, ddaC class IV neurons in ban mutants have a mean coverage index of 1.22, meaning that the receptive field of the average ddaC dendrite in ban mutant larvae is 122% of the size of the dorsal hemisegment that harbors the neuron. Thus, dendrites in ban mutants promiscuously cross boundaries that are observed by dendrites of WT neurons (Figure 3B′). For example, fewer than two dendrite branches cross the midline for a given WT class IV neuron, whereas more than 18 dendrite branches cross the midline in ban mutants (Figure 3E). The exuberant growth of dendrites in ban mutants is manifest throughout the arbor, not just at the boundaries. However, although we see a coverage index of >1 for ban mutant, we do not see a significant tiling defect because branches that cross normal boundaries still avoid dendrites of neighboring class IV neurons. In addition to these defects in dendrite coverage, class IV neurons in ban mutants show significant increases in the number of dendrites, the density of dendrites, and overall dendrite length (data not shown). However, increased terminal dendrite branching is not sufficient to increase receptive field coverage. Several other mutants have been described that increase terminal dendrite branching in class IV neurons, and none of these mutants cause an overall increase in the size of the dendritic field. For example, furry (fry) mutations cause a 100% increase in the number/density of terminal dendrites (Emoto et al., 2004Emoto K. He Y. Ye B. Grueber W.B. Adler P.N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Control of dendritic branching and tiling by the Tricornered-kinase/Furry signaling pathway in Drosophila sensory neurons.Cell. 2004; 119: 245-256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) without an accompanying increase in coverage index at 96 hr AEL (Figure 4M). Likewise, overexpression of the small GTPase Rac drastically increases terminal dendrite branching but reduces receptive field coverage (data not shown). The dendrite growth defects in ban mutants could reflect increased dendrite growth from early stages of development or defects specific to the scaling phase of dendrite growth. To distinguish between these possibilities, we monitored dendrite growth over a developmental time course, focusing on the coverage index and midline crossing events as metrics for growth of the dendrite arbor as a whole. Importantly, class IV dendrites in ban mutants are indistinguishable from WT during the early, rapid growth phase (through 48 hr AEL) as measured by coverage index, midline crossing events (Figures 3C–3E), and total dendrite branch number (data not shown). However, beginning at 72 hr AEL, we noted progressively more severe defects in the coverage index and a greater number of midline crossing events in ban mutants (Figures 3D and 3E). This late-onset exuberant dendrite growth demonstrates that ban is not causing a general growth defect since ban is dispensable for establishment of dendrite coverage. Whereas a generalized defect in dendrite growth, as seen in dar mutants (Ye et al., 2007Ye B. Zhang Y. Song W. Younger S.H. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Growing dendrites and axons differ in their reliance on the secretory pathway.Cell. 2007; 130: 717-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar), would affect both the early (isometric) and late (scaling) phases of growth, mutations that specifically affect the scaling growth of dendrites would be dispensable for the early, rapid growth of dendritic fields. This is precisely what we see for ban mutants. Therefore, ban is specifically required for scaling of dendrite arbors, potentially by affecting growth-inhibitory signals that normally restrict dendrite growth. To confirm that loss of ban causes these phenotypes, we conducted the following experiments. First, whereas heterozygosity for a ban null allele or deficiencies that span the ban locus show no obvious defects in dendrite scaling, placing ban mutations in trans to a deficiency that spans the locus, but not a nearby deficiency that does not span the ban locus, recapitulates the dendrite defects described above (Figure S3). Second, the ban mutant dendrite defects can be fully rescued by a ban genomic rescue transgene but not a genomic transgene in which the ban locus has been deleted (Figure S3). Therefore, disrupting ban function is sufficient to cause defects in scaling growth of dendrites. We next tested whether ban is required for scaling growth of dendrites in other classes of da neurons. Both class I and class III neurons establish proper dendrite coverage in ban mutants (data not shown). However, class III dendrites are defective in scaling of dendrite growth in ban mutants, showing a significant increase in dendrite coverage after 48 hr AEL (Figures 3F and S4). In contrast, larval class I dendrites show no obvious defects in dendrite coverage in ban mutants, demonstrating that ban is not required for scaling in class I neurons (Figures 3G and S4). The onset of scaling growth of dendrites differs by 24 hr in class I and class III/IV neurons (Figure 1F), thus different scaling signals may operate at the two time points with ban required for the scaling growth signal for class III/IV neurons that tile. Next, we conducted time-lapse microscopy of single neurons to characterize the cellular basis of the ban mutant phenotype. We imaged single class IV neurons from time-matched WT or ban mutant larvae at 24 hr intervals beginning at 72 hr AEL, just after the ban phenotype is first apparent (Figure S5). We monitored dynamics of every terminal dendrite that could be unambiguously followed through the time course and measured dendrite growth, initiation of new dendrites, dendrite retraction, and branch loss. For each of these categories, ban mutants differed from WT controls, exhibiting significantly more dendrite growth and branch initiation and significantly less dendrite retraction and branch loss (Figures 3H and S5). Therefore, stabilization of existing dendrites, increased dendrite growth, and increased addition of new dendrites all contribute to the defect in dendrite scaling growth of the ban mutant. Our time-lapse studies suggest that signals normally restricting dendrite growth are largely absent in ban mutants. We set out to verify this hypothesis using laser ablation assays. Previous studies showed that, following embryonic ablation of a class IV neuron, dendrites of neighboring neurons grow exuberantly to invade the unoccupied territory of the ablated neuron (Grueber et al., 2003bGrueber W.B. Ye B. Moore A.W. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Dendrites of distinct classes of Drosophila sensory neurons show different capacities for homotypic repulsion.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, Sugimura et al., 2003Sugimura K. Yamamoto M. Niwa R. Satoh D. Goto S. Taniguchi M. Hayashi S. Uemura T. Distinct developmental modes and lesion-induced reactions of dendrites of two classes of Drosophila sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3752-3760PubMed Google Scholar), with the ability of dendrites to invade unoccupied territory progressively restricted in older larvae (Sugimura et al., 2003Sugimura K. Yamamoto M. Niwa R. Satoh D. Goto S. Taniguchi M. Hayashi S. Uemura T. Distinct developmental modes and lesion-induced reactions of dendrites of two classes of Drosophila sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3752-3760PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore wanted to determine whether the timing of this restricted growth potential correlates with the onset of scaling of dendrite growth and whether ban is required for restriction of the dendrite growth potential. Consistent with prior reports, ablating a class IV neuron at 24 hr AEL led to extensive invasion by dendrites of neighboring neurons, with 55% of the unoccupied territory covered by neighboring neurons 48 hr postablation (Figures 4A and 4D). This ability of dendrites to grow into unoccupied territory was severely attenuated 1 day later, with dendrites of neighboring neurons invading only 23% of the unoccupied territory after ablation of a class IV neuron at 48 hr AEL (Figures 4B and 4D). The extent of invasion was even further reduced when neurons were ablated at 72 hr AEL (Figures 4C and 4D). Therefore, the ability of dendrites to grow beyond their normal boundaries to invade unoccupied territory is severely restricted during larval development at a time coincident with the onset of scaling of dendrite growth. If the restriction of dendrite growth potential in larvae is caused by scaling signals that limit dendrites to growth in proportion to body wall growth, the majority of invading activity by neighboring dendrites should be present before scaling growth ensues at 48 hr AEL. To test this prediction, we ablated class IV neurons at 24 hr AEL and monitored invasion activity at 24 hr intervals over the next 72 hr (Figure 4E). By 48 hr AEL, dendrites of neighboring neurons had invaded unoccupied territory, and the extent of invasion was not noticeably increased at later time points. Instead, the entire dendrite arbor of class IV neurons, including the portion that invaded unoccupied territory, scaled with larval growth after 48 hr AEL (Figures 4E and 4F). Thus, the receptive field that is established by 48 hr AEL is maintained by scaling of dendrite growth, even in cases in which dendrites establish aberrant body wall coverage. The signals responsible for dendrite scaling growth are likely distinct from the homotypic repulsion required to establish tiling as ablation of all neighboring same-type neurons does not potentiate the ability of a class IV neuron to invade unoccupied territory (data not shown). Additionally, dendrites of class I da neurons, which do not rely on homotypic repulsion to establish their coverage, also exhibit scaling growth. As described above, dendrite coverage is properly established in ban mutants (Figure 3C). Importantly, unlike WT controls, following ablation at 48 hr AEL, dendrites in ban mutants extensively fill unoccupied space (Figures 4G–4I), with dendrites in ban mutants invading unoccupied territory just as efficiently as dendrites in WT controls ablated at 24 hr AEL. Therefore, the receptive field boundaries of class IV neurons have not been fixed in ban mutants at 48 hr AEL. Dendrites in ban mutants invade unoccupied territory more efficiently than WT controls at later time points as well (Figure 4H). Thus, either the growth-inhibitory scaling signal is lost or dendrites are refractory to the signal in ban mutants. To test whether machineries for dendritic tiling contribute to the progressive reduction of a dendrite's ability to invade vacant territories, we examined mutations of fry, which encodes a gene required for establishment of dendritic tiling (Emoto et al., 2004Emoto K. He Y. Ye B. Grueber W.B. Adler P.N. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N.

Although roles for DISC1 in postnatal neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) have recently emerged, it is not known how DISC1 and its interacting proteins govern the migration, positioning, and differentiation of dentate granule cells (DGCs). Here, we report that DISC1 interacts with the actin-binding protein girdin to regulate axonal development. DGCs in girdin-deficient neonatal mice exhibit deficits in axonal sprouting in the cornu ammonis 3 region of the hippocampus. Girdin deficiency, RNA interference-mediated knockdown, and inhibition of the DISC1/girdin interaction lead to overextended migration and mispositioning of the DGCs resulting in profound cytoarchitectural disorganization of the DG. These findings identify girdin as an intrinsic factor in postnatal development of the DG and provide insights into the critical role of the DISC1/girdin interaction in postnatal neurogenesis in the DG."

https://openalex.org/W2015236906,"Glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporters play important roles in regulating neuronal activity. Glu is removed from the extracellular space dominantly by glial transporters. In contrast, GABA is mainly taken up by neurons. However, the glial GABA transporter subtypes share their localization with the Glu transporters and their expression is confined to the same subpopulation of astrocytes, raising the possibility of cooperation between Glu and GABA transport processes.Here we used diverse biological models both in vitro and in vivo to explore the interplay between these processes. We found that removal of Glu by astrocytic transporters triggers an elevation in the extracellular level of GABA. This coupling between excitatory and inhibitory signaling was found to be independent of Glu receptor-mediated depolarization, external presence of Ca(2+) and glutamate decarboxylase activity. It was abolished in the presence of non-transportable blockers of glial Glu or GABA transporters, suggesting that the concerted action of these transporters underlies the process.Our results suggest that activation of Glu transporters results in GABA release through reversal of glial GABA transporters. This transporter-mediated interplay represents a direct link between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission and may function as a negative feedback combating intense excitation in pathological conditions such as epilepsy or ischemia."

These results uncover a previously unknown obligatory role for the high-affinity subunits for ionotropic kainate receptor function and further demonstrate that kainate receptor participation in metabotropic signaling pathways does not require their classic role as ion channels. Kainate receptors are glutamate-gated ion channels that have complex and diverse roles in regulating synaptic transmission and cellular excitability. Five separate genes (Grik1–5) encode the different receptor subunits, which are categorized into two separate groups based upon their ability to form functional homomeric receptors and their similar primary sequence homology. The principal subunits, GluK1, GluK2, and GluK3 (previously termed GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7), form functional plasma membrane-localized receptors in recombinant expression systems. GluK4 (KA1) and GluK5 (KA2) subunits are often termed the “high-affinity” subunits, because of their low nanomolar affinity for the marine toxin kainic acid, or “auxiliary” subunits, because they do not assemble as functional homomeric receptors. Instead, they modify the biophysical function and pharmacological properties of kainate receptors when coexpressed with GluK1–3 subunits (Herb et al., 1992Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B.

Neuronal kainate receptors are composed of heteromeric assemblies of principal and auxiliary subunits. The unique physiological and pharmacological properties displayed by neuronal kainate receptors are determined largely by their subunit composition. Therefore, kainate receptor subunit expression in distinct neuronal cell types is an important indicator of the functional contribution of these receptors to synaptic signaling. The primary subunits are expressed in complex patterns during development and in the adult brain (Bahn et al., 1994Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W.

A complex mosaic of high-affinity kainate receptors in rat brain.J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3582-3598Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some neurons a single principal subunit determines the presence of functional plasma membrane kainate receptors (Mulle et al., 1998Mulle C. Sailer A. Perez-Otano I. Dickinson-Anson H.

Subunit composition of kainate receptors in hippocampal interneurons.Neuron. 2000; 28: 475-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In contrast the high-affinity subunits display two very distinct expression profiles. The GluK5 subunit is expressed ubiquitously in nearly all neuronal populations, suggesting that it is a constituent of most heteromeric neuronal kainate receptor assemblies (Herb et al., 1992Herb A. Burnashev N. Werner P. Sakmann B. Wisden W. Seeburg P.H.

The GluK4 subunit shows very limited and well-defined expression in just a few neuronal cell types after birth (Bahn et al., 1994Bahn S. Volk B. Wisden W.

In the hippocampus, GluK4 mRNA is expressed at high levels in the CA3 pyramidal neurons and at very low levels in granule cells in the dentate gyrus (Werner et al., 1991Werner P. Voigt M. Keinanen K.

No other brain regions have high levels of GluK4 expression, although Purkinje neurons in the cerebellum express low amounts of mRNA and GluK4 protein (Darstein et al., 2003Darstein M. Petralia R.S.

Kainate receptor function has been primarily examined in the hippocampus. The lack of selective pharmacological agents has remained an impediment to their study and has increased the importance of analyzing kainate receptor function in knockout mice (Contractor et al., 2003Contractor A.

Surprisingly, some of the actions of presynaptic kainate receptors are mediated by metabotropic signaling cascades divergent from their canonical function as ligand-gated cation channels (Frerking et al., 2001Frerking M.

The metabotropic signaling of kainate receptors has also been demonstrated to have an altogether distinct action on cellular excitability through a long lasting inhibition of the slow Ca2+-activated K+ conductance (IsAHP; Melyan et al., 2002Melyan Z.

The ionotropic and metabotropic actions of kainate receptors in hippocampal pyramidal neurons have been proposed to be differentially mediated by distinct component subunits, GluK2 and GluK5, respectively (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz A.

It is unknown if the closely related high affinity subunit, GluK4, performs a similar function because pharmacological tools that discriminate between the different subunits have not been developed. To determine the contribution of high-affinity subunits in determining the properties of neuronal kainate receptors, we generated a GluK4 receptor subunit knockout mouse. Moreover, we eliminated both high-affinity subunits in a double knockout mouse by crossing GluK4 knockouts to a GluK5 knockout mouse (Contractor et al., 2003Contractor A. Sailer A.W. Darstein M. Maron C. Xu J. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Loss of kainate receptor-mediated heterosynaptic facilitation of mossy-fiber synapses in KA2−/− mice.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of kainate receptor function in the hippocampus revealed that ablation of the GluK4 subunit led to a significant reduction in the synaptically evoked kainate receptor EPSC (EPSCKA) at mossy fiber synapses. In the double GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice, we did not observe any kainate-mediated EPSCs at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. GluK2 receptor protein expression was not significantly reduced, although there was a consistent reduction in synaptically localized receptors observed with immunoelectron microscopy. Despite equivalent surface expression of GluK2 in the hippocampus, agonist-evoked kainate receptor whole-cell currents were not observed in either CA1 or CA3 hippocampal neurons in the double-knockout mice. In contrast to this loss of ionotropic function, low concentrations of kainate effectively inhibited the IsAHP in CA3 pyramidal neurons from GluK4−/−, GluK5−/−, and GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice. These studies demonstrate the surprising result that the high-affinity GluK4 and GluK5 subunits are essential for the normal ionotropic function of neuronal kainate receptors but are not obligatory for linking kainate receptors to metabotropic signaling pathways. In order to understand the function of the high-affinity kainate receptor subunits, GluK4 and GluK5 (formerly KA1 and KA2), we generated a mutant mouse in which we engineered loxP sites into intronic regions of the Grik4 locus, flanking a crucial exon that encodes the M2 p-loop of the receptor channel (see Figures S1A–S1C available online). Cre-mediated recombination of the two loxP sites resulted in deletion of this exon and loss of both the mRNA (Figure S1D) and the protein product in GluK4−/− mice (Figure S1E). These mice were crossed to the previously characterized GluK5 null mouse (Contractor et al., 2003Contractor A. Sailer A.W. Darstein M. Maron C. Xu J. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Loss of kainate receptor-mediated heterosynaptic facilitation of mossy-fiber synapses in KA2−/− mice.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar) to produce a new strain with both high-affinity subunits deleted (GluK4−/−/GluK5−/−). There were no developmental (Figure S1F) or behavioral phenotypes evident in these mice. Neuronal kainate receptors have been best described in the hippocampus, where they have been functionally localized to both postsynaptic densities (Castillo et al., 1997Castillo P.E. Malenka R.C.

Of the several different excitatory and inhibitory synapses where kainate receptors play a role in synaptic transmission, the mossy fiber synapse, formed between the axons of the dentate gyrus granule cells and the pyramidal neurons in the CA3 region, is a particularly good model for studying kainate receptor function. At this synapse, kainate receptors subserve both pre- and postsynaptic roles in modulating and mediating synaptic transmission and have been implicated in NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation (Bortolotto et al., 1999Bortolotto Z.A.

Kainate receptors are involved in short- and long-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2001; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Both GluK4 and GluK5 are expressed in granule cells and CA3 pyramidal neurons, and are localized to the mossy fiber presynaptic boutons and postsynaptic density in CA3 pyramidal cell thorny excrescence spines (Darstein et al., 2003Darstein M. Petralia R.S. Swanson G.T. Wenthold R.J. Heinemann S.F. Distribution of kainate receptor subunits at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 8013-8019PubMed Google Scholar). At the mossy fiber synapse, two forms of presynaptic short-term plasticity, paired-pulse facilitation, and frequency facilitation, are disrupted in mice in which either of the principal subunits GluK2 or GluK3 are ablated (Contractor et al., 2001Contractor A.

Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12181-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). No such disruption in short term plasticity was observed in GluK5−/− mice (Contractor et al., 2003Contractor A. Sailer A.W. Darstein M. Maron C. Xu J. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Loss of kainate receptor-mediated heterosynaptic facilitation of mossy-fiber synapses in KA2−/− mice.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). We first examined the contributions of GluK4 and GluK5 to presynaptic kainate receptor function at mossy fiber synapses in the knockout mice by recording from CA3 neurons in GluK4−/− mice and their wild-type (WT) littermates. Paired stimuli were given to evoke mossy fiber EPSCs and paired-pulse ratios measured at several interstimulus intervals. We found no difference in paired-pulse facilitation between GluK4−/− and WT mice at any of the interstimulus intervals (Figure 1Aiii; ns for all interstimulus intervals by two-way ANOVA; n = 14 for GluK4−/−, n = 11 for WT). Similarly, the facilitation of EPSC amplitudes observed when afferent stimulation frequency was increased from 0.05 Hz to 1 Hz was not different between recordings from GluK4−/− mutants and WT mice (379% ± 32%, n = 13 for WT; 331% ± 43%, n = 13 for GluK4−/−; ns by one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni posttest; Figure 1Biii). Thus, elimination of GluK4 alone does not impact facilitation of transmission mediated by presynaptic kainate receptors, similar to what was found in GluK5 subunit knockout mice (Contractor et al., 2003Contractor A. Sailer A.W. Darstein M. Maron C. Xu J. Swanson G.T. Heinemann S.F. Loss of kainate receptor-mediated heterosynaptic facilitation of mossy-fiber synapses in KA2−/− mice.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if elimination of both high affinity subunits had an impact on presynaptic autoreceptor function, we made similar recordings from GluK4/GluK5 double knockout mice (Figure 1A). In contrast to the single knockouts, we observed a significant difference in paired-pulse ratio measurements at the shortest interstimulus intervals from 20–100 ms (WT at 20 ms, 3.26 ± 0.28; GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− at 20 ms, 2.44 ± 0.15; WT at 40 ms, 2.96 ± 0.26; GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− at 40 ms, 2.17 ± 0.07; WT at 100 ms, 2.69 ± 0.13; GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− at 100 ms, 2.27 ± 0.11; significant by two-way ANOVA, WT, n = 11; GluK4−/−/GluK5−/−, n = 14). Prior studies in GluK2 (Contractor et al., 2001Contractor A. Swanson G. Heinemann S.F. Kainate receptors are involved in short- and long-term plasticity at mossy fiber synapses in the hippocampus.Neuron. 2001; 29: 209-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) and GluK3 (Pinheiro et al., 2007Pinheiro P.S. Perrais D. Coussen F. Barhanin J. Bettler B. Mann J.R. Malva J.O. Heinemann S.F. Mulle C. GluR7 is an essential subunit of presynaptic kainate autoreceptors at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 12181-12186Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) knockout mice found that ablation of these primary subunits caused deficits in both paired-pulse facilitation and frequency facilitation. In contrast to this, we found no parallel deficits in frequency facilitation in the GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice (376% ± 41%, n = 11 for GluK4−/−/GluK5−/−; ns from WT, one-way ANOVA; Figure 1B). These results therefore differentiate at least two populations of presynaptic kainate receptors: (1) those containing GluK4 and/or GluK5 subunits positioned to respond to single release events (engaged during paired, high-frequency stimuli) and (2) those receptors that mediate facilitation during longer, lower-frequency stimulations, possibly located further from the neurotransmitter release sites, which do not require GluK4 or GluK5 as component subunits. The finding that paired-pulse facilitation is deficient in GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice, while frequency facilitation is intact, raises an interesting dissociation of the involvement of kainate receptors in these two forms of plasticity. A recent study has questioned the importance of the contribution of presynaptic kainate receptors to mossy fiber synaptic facilitation (Kwon and Castillo, 2008Kwon H.B. Castillo P.E. Role of glutamate autoreceptors at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses.Neuron. 2008; 60: 1082-1094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine if frequency facilitation in GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− knockout mice was indeed, in part, mediated by a presynaptic autoreceptor, as has been repeatedly reported by other laboratories as well as our own (Breustedt and Schmitz, 2004Breustedt J.

Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13139-13149Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), we performed further experiments using a pharmacological strategy to acutely antagonize kainate receptors. We recorded the mixed AMPA/NMDA EPSC and measured the NMDA receptor component 30 ms after the onset of the current (see Experimental Procedures). In WT mice, the NMDA component of the mossy fiber EPSC facilitated on average 260% ± 30% (n = 5) when the frequency of afferent stimulation was increased from 0.05 Hz to 1Hz (Figure 1Ci). When the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX (50 μM) was present the facilitation of the NMDA mossy fiber EPSC was significantly diminished (p < 0.05). In interleaved experiments in GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice, we observed a similar significant reduction in frequency facilitation of mossy fiber synaptic transmission by CNQX (Figure 1Cii). Therefore, in both WT and GluK4−/−/GluK5−/− mice, it is clear that facilitation of mossy fiber synaptic transmission is in part mediated by a facilitatory kainate autoreceptor. Application of kainate receptor agonists has a biphasic effect on mossy fiber synaptic transmission; low concentrations enhance mossy fiber EPSCs whereas higher concentrations depress mossy fiber transmission (Schmitz et al., 2001Schmitz D.

https://openalex.org/W1997785662,"Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is a plasma membrane Ca(2+) channel involved in transduction of painful stimuli. Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons express ectopic but functional TRPV1 channels in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (TRPV1(ER)). We have studied the properties of TRPV1(ER) in DRG neurons and HEK293T cells expressing TRPV1. Activation of TRPV1(ER) with capsaicin or other vanilloids produced an increase of cytosolic Ca(2+) due to Ca(2+) release from the ER. The decrease of [Ca(2+)](ER) was directly revealed by an ER-targeted aequorin Ca(2+) probe, expressed in DRG neurons using a herpes amplicon virus. The sensitivity of TRPV1(ER) to capsaicin was smaller than the sensitivity of the plasma membrane TRPV1 channels. The low affinity of TRPV1(ER) was not related to protein kinase A- or C-mediated phosphorylations, but it was due to inactivation by cytosolic Ca(2+) because the sensitivity to capsaicin was increased by loading the cells with the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA. Decreasing [Ca(2+)](ER) did not affect the sensitivity of TRPV1(ER) to capsaicin. Disruption of the TRPV1 calmodulin-binding domains at either the C terminus (Delta35AA) or the N terminus (K155A) increased 10-fold the affinity of TRPV1(ER) for capsaicin, suggesting that calmodulin is involved in the inactivation. The lack of TRPV1 sensitizers, such as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, in the ER could contribute to decrease the affinity for capsaicin. The low sensitivity of TRPV1(ER) to agonists may be critical for neuron health, because otherwise Ca(2+) depletion of ER could lead to ER stress, unfolding protein response, and cell death."

Interneuron diversity can thereby promote differential firing from neurons receiving common excitation. In contrast, Golgi cells are the sole interneurons regulating granule cell spiking evoked by mossy fibers, thereby gating inputs to the cerebellar cortex. Here, we examine how this single interneuron class modifies activity in its targets. We find that GABAA-mediated transmission at unitary Golgi cell → granule cell synapses consists of varying contributions of fast synaptic currents and sustained inhibition. Fast IPSCs depress and slow IPSCs gradually build during high-frequency Golgi cell activity. Consequently, fast and slow inhibition differentially influence granule cell spike timing during persistent mossy fiber input. Furthermore, slow inhibition reduces the gain of the mossy fiber → granule cell input-output curve, while fast inhibition increases the threshold. Thus, a lack of interneuron diversity need not prevent flexible inhibitory control of synaptic processing.

Furthermore, high affinity α6-containing GABAA receptors render granule cells sensitive to ambient GABA levels in the glomerulus, creating a tonic conductance that dampens excitability (Brickley et al., 1996Brickley S.G.

Ultrastructural studies show that within a glomerulus the number and size of connections made by Golgi cell axons to granule cells is highly variable and 40% of granule cells are not directly contacted by a Golgi cell axon (Jakab and Hamori, 1988Jakab R.L. Hamori J. Quantitative morphology and synaptology of cerebellar glomeruli in the rat.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1988; 179: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the potential for variation in the time course and properties of inhibition may be present at individual Golgi cell → granule cell synapses. Our understanding of the functional role of Golgi cell inhibition has been limited by the fact that the properties of individual Golgi cell → granule cell connections have not been characterized in detail. Moreover, the properties of this synapse during elevated Golgi cell firing at rates observed in vivo (Holtzman et al., 2006Holtzman T. Mostofi A. Phuah C.L. Edgley S.A.

As a consequence, studies of the effects of inhibition on the input-output relationship at the mossy fiber to granule cell synapses have focused on steady-state conditions and regulation by tonic inhibition provided by the Golgi cell (Mitchell and Silver, 2003Mitchell S.J. Silver R.A.

Cathala L. Steuber V. Silver R.A. Synaptic depression enables neuronal gain control.Nature. 2009; 457: 1015-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Here, we investigate the properties of individual Golgi cell → granule cell synapses during elevated Golgi cell activity. We find that there is considerable diversity in the properties of individual synapses: some are dominated by fast IPSCs, others consist only of slow IPSCs, and many have both fast and slow components. The slow IPSC dominates charge transfer during high frequency trains and is evident even in the absence of direct synaptic contacts. Dynamic clamp studies of the effect of Golgi cell inhibition on granule cell firing suggest that the two types of inhibition have differential effects on the timing and number of spikes evoked by mossy fiber input. Fast IPSCs are most effective at suppressing granule cell firing early in the stimulus train, whereas the slow IPSC dramatically reduces late spikes during sustained mossy fiber activity. Fast and slow inhibition also differentially regulate the input-output curves at the mossy fiber → granule cell synapse, with the slow component selectively reducing the gain and the fast component affecting the threshold of activation. Together these findings suggest that a single type of interneuron can regulate activity in different ways with distinct functional consequences. We examined the frequency dependence of inhibition at the Golgi cell → granule cell synapse by stimulating Golgi cell axons with an extracellular electrode placed in the granular layer and recording IPSCs in granule cells. Synapses were activated with 100 stimuli at 5 to 100 Hz, with excitatory transmission blocked. Low-frequency spontaneous IPSCs were observed in the absence of stimulation. Stimulation evoked inhibitory currents that consisted of fast IPSCs (Figure 1A) riding atop a slow IPSC component (Figure 1A, red traces; see Figure S1 available online). Increases in stimulus frequency increased the amplitude of the slow IPSC, whereas the amplitude of the fast IPSCs decreased. The relative contribution of the fast and slow components of the IPSC was determined by integrating the currents measured in Figure 1A to quantify the total synaptic charge (Figure 1B, black) and then by integrating the slow component of the synaptic current (Figure 1B, red), with the traces normalized to the total IPSC integral. For the examples shown, the slow IPSC carried 59% and 88% of the total synaptic charge at 10 Hz and 50 Hz, respectively. In the representative experiment, the fast IPSCs decreased from 130 pA at 10 Hz to 75 pA at 50 Hz (Figure 1C). Average fast IPSC amplitudes decreased steadily above stimulation frequencies of 10 Hz, reaching 32% ± 6% of their initial value at 100 Hz (Figure 1D, n = 4 cells). The fractional contribution of the slow component increased from 37% ± 6% at 5 Hz to 96% ± 2% at 100 Hz (Figure 1E, n = 4 cells). These data suggest that for these experimental conditions fast IPSCs are most prominent at low-stimulus frequencies, but the slow IPSC dominates at higher frequencies. Previous studies have shown that granule cells express high affinity α6-containing GABAA receptors, which can be enriched extrasynaptically (Nusser et al., 1998Nusser Z. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Segregation of different GABAA receptors to synaptic and extrasynaptic membranes of cerebellar granule cells.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1693-1703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may preferentially carry the slow IPSC (Hamann et al., 2002Hamann M. Rossi D.J. Attwell D. Tonic and spillover inhibition of granule cells control information flow through cerebellar cortex.Neuron. 2002; 33: 625-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, Rossi and Hamann, 1998Rossi D.J.

Spillover-mediated transmission at inhibitory synapses promoted by high affinity alpha6 subunit GABA(A) receptors and glomerular geometry.Neuron. 1998; 20: 783-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). We determined the dependence of the slow IPSC on these receptors by evoking trains in the presence of furosemide. Although this drug can block KCl cotransporters (Payne, 1997Payne J.A. Functional characterization of the neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter: implications for [K+]o regulation.Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1516-C1525PubMed Google Scholar), it only blocks those GABAA receptors containing the α6 subunit (Korpi et al., 1995Korpi E.R. Kuner T. Seeburg P.H. Luddens H. Selective antagonist for the cerebellar granule cell-specific gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). Furosemide (100 μM) decreased the amplitude of the total IPSC integral by approximately 50% but did not selectively reduce the fraction carried by the slow IPSC (Figure S2). The inhibitory currents were eliminated by bicuculline (20 μM; data not shown). Overall, these data suggest that under these conditions both α1 and α6-containing GABAA receptors contribute to the fast and slow components of the Golgi cell → granule cell IPSC. Electron microscopic reconstructions indicate that dendrites from many granule cells are contained within a single glomerulus, but Golgi cell axons make direct contacts onto only 60% of them (Jakab and Hamori, 1988Jakab R.L. Hamori J. Quantitative morphology and synaptology of cerebellar glomeruli in the rat.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1988; 179: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If direct synapses mediate fast IPSCs and nearby release sites onto other granule cells mediate slow IPSCs via spillover as suggested by previous work (Rossi and Hamann, 1998Rossi D.J. Hamann M. Spillover-mediated transmission at inhibitory synapses promoted by high affinity alpha6 subunit GABA(A) receptors and glomerular geometry.Neuron. 1998; 20: 783-795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), these morphological studies suggest that there is likely to be diversity with regard to the contribution of fast and slow IPSCs at individual synapses. Moreover, for granule cells receiving direct Golgi cell synapses the size and number of these connections is variable (Jakab and Hamori, 1988Jakab R.L. Hamori J. Quantitative morphology and synaptology of cerebellar glomeruli in the rat.Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 1988; 179: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), suggesting the efficacy of the fast IPSC is not uniform across individual synapses. We tested these possibilities by examining inhibition at individual Golgi cell → granule cell connections. Paired recordings were made with a whole-cell electrode to record postsynaptic responses in granule cells and an on cell electrode to monitor spontaneous Golgi cell firing. Twenty-six percent (42/163) of the cell pairs studied were connected. In a representative pair (Figures 2A–2C) a fraction of presynaptic Golgi cell spikes are accompanied by a large short-latency synaptic current in the granule cell with a prominent fast IPSC. The latency, measured from the peak of the downward deflection of the spike to the peak of the first derivative of the average unitary IPSC, was 1.3 ms for this pair. In addition to these short-latency IPSCs, there were also IPSCs observed that were not linked to spiking in the Golgi cell being monitored (Figure 2A, ∗). It is likely that such IPSCs are evoked by spontaneous firing of other Golgi cells. Putative connections were analyzed using Golgi cell spike-triggered averages of the granule cell recording. A subset of 25 Golgi cell spikes are shown for the sample pair (Figure 2B, upper) along with the corresponding postsynaptic currents (Figure 2B, lower, gray traces), which exhibited a broad amplitude distribution (Figure 2C). This pair had an average unitary IPSC amplitude of 14 pA, a failure rate of 0.48, and a potency (average of successes) of 26 pA. At 36 connections exhibiting a fast IPSC, the latencies were similarly short and narrowly distributed, with a mean of 1.15 ± 0.05 ms (Figure 2D, black). The functional properties of these short-latency connections varied considerably. The failure rate (Figure 2E) and potency (Figure 2F) at each pair was broadly distributed with an average potency of 32 ± 3 pA (n = 36, Figure 2F, black) and an average failure rate of 0.58 ± 0.04 (n = 36, Figure 2E). Thus, the efficacy of the fast IPSC varies markedly between pairs. Interestingly, a small subset of pairs (5/42) exhibited unitary IPSCs with markedly longer latencies, averaging 10 ± 2.5 ms (Figure 2D, red) and had very small unitary IPSC amplitudes, averaging 3.0 ± 0.4 pA (Figure 2F, red). As discussed below, these long-latency connections lack a fast component of inhibition. These data highlight the variation in the functional properties of individual Golgi cell → granule cell connections. To examine the relative contribution of fast and slow IPSCs at a Golgi cell → granule cell pair, the time course of charge transfer following a spike was quantified. A subset of 10 IPSCs from four sample connections (Figure 2G, middle, gray traces) are shown aligned to the presynaptic spike (Figure 2G, upper), along with the average unitary IPSC (Figure 2G, lower, black trace). Connections differed markedly with regard to their time course (Figures 2Ga–2Gd, lower). In some cases pairs exhibited a large fast IPSC that decayed rapidly (Figure 2Ga). In others, which correspond to the long-latency pairs discussed above, an exclusively slow IPSC was observed (Figure 2Gd). In addition, many pairs exhibited fast IPSCs with slower decays indicative of a progressively larger contribution of the slow IPSC at that connection (Figures 2Gb and 2Gc). To quantify this variation in the time course of synaptic currents across Golgi cell → granule cell pairs, the unitary IPSC was integrated and normalized to the peak of the integral. The fractional IPSC charge at ten milliseconds after onset (Figure 2H, left) ranged from 12% for the pair with the exclusively slow IPSC (Figure 2Gd) to 81% for the pair with the rapidly decaying fast IPSC (Figure 2Ga), and from approximately 5% to 100% across all 42 connections (Figure 2I). Over longer time scales (Figures 2H, right, and 2J) the time to half-amplitude (A0.5) exhibited a broad distribution, with a peak near 10 ms and a tail consisting of pairs with larger contributions of the slow IPSC. These data indicate that the contribution of fast and slow IPSCs, as reflected in the time course of the unitary IPSC across Golgi cell → granule cell connections, varies markedly. We next sought to determine the properties of individual synapses during activation with stimulus trains. On-cell recordings allowed us to noninvasively monitor the properties of individual synapses, but they are limited by the reliance on synapses driven by the spontaneous Golgi cell activity. To allow activation of individual Golgi cells in this configuration, we generated a lentivirus to express mCherry-tagged channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in the cerebellum under the control of the synapsin I promoter (Boyden et al., 2005Boyden E.S. Zhang F. Bamberg E. Nagel G. Deisseroth K. Millisecond-timescale, genetically targeted optical control of neural activity.Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1263-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (2987) Google Scholar). Brief blue light pulses (1 ms, 473 nm) of increasing intensity delivered to the soma of a ChR2-expressing Golgi cell (Figure 3A) produced progressively larger depolarizations, sufficient to reach the action potential threshold (Figure 3B). Golgi cell firing could be entrained by brief suprathreshold blue light pulses (Figure 3C). The currents evoked by these light pulse trains show desensitization (Figure 3D, upper) but are still able to drive 50 Hz firing of Golgi cells and precisely maintain a single spike per light pulse (Figure 3D, lower). We compared the properties of inhibition evoked by spontaneous Golgi cell firing or blue light pulses at the soma (Figures 3E–3G). A sample paired recording with a ChR2-expressing Golgi cell is shown in Figure 3E, in which IPSCs are recorded during spontaneous firing and when firing is entrained at the spontaneous frequency with light. Overlaying average spontaneous IPSCs (Figure 3F, left, gray/black traces) and those evoked by ChR2 at the same frequency (Figure 3F, right, light/dark blue traces) demonstrates that release is not obviously perturbed by light activation. A plot of spontaneous IPSC amplitude against ChR2-evoked amplitude falls along the unity line (Figure 3G, n = 7 cells). Overall, these data indicate that ChR2 precisely and reliably drives Golgi cell spiking and does not alter properties of release under our conditions. We used ChR2 to evoke trains of Golgi cell activity in connected pairs. Figure 4 shows sample trains of 100 stimuli at 10 Hz, 20 Hz, and 50 Hz evoked at three connections with differing properties. The firing of the presynaptic Golgi cell was always monitored with an on-cell electrode, and postsynaptic events were detected using a presynaptic spike-triggered average. In the first sample pair, spontaneous activity in the Golgi cell produced a unitary IPSC with a large, reliable fast component (failure rate = 0.1, potency = 56 pA, unitary amplitude = 51 pA) and an A0.5 of 15 ms (Figure 4A). High-frequency activation at this pair evoked large fast IPSCs and, as observed in extracellular stimulation experiments, a slow IPSC that became increasingly prominent with increases in stimulation frequency (Figure 4B, red traces). The slow IPSC contributed 55% of the charge at 10 Hz, increasing to 87% at 50 Hz. In a second pair, Golgi cell stimulation at 10 Hz evoked a unitary IPSC with a smaller, less reliable fast component (potency = 17 pA, failure rate = 0.88, unitary amplitude = 3 pA) and a longer A0.5 of 23 ms (Figure 4C). A prominent slow IPSC, that carried 90% to 99% of the charge as the Golgi cell firing rate increased from 10 Hz to 50 Hz, was still evident (Figure 4D). At the third connection, which contained no fast IPSC (average = 4 pA, A0.5 = 34 ms; Figure 4E), trains of Golgi cell activity evoked a slow IPSC that carried all of the charge and increased in amplitude with stimulation frequency (Figure 4F). The small phasic events seen in Figure 4F are not linked to the spiking of the activated Golgi cell and likely arise from activity in a different cell. These findings indicate that high-frequency firing in a single Golgi cell is sufficient to produce a prominent slow IPSC during high-frequency trains, even in the absence of a fast IPSC from a direct connection. The slow IPSC grows with increases in the firing rate to dominate charge transfer (range = 78%–100% at 50 Hz, n = 9), similar to our observations with extracellular stimulation. Our data demonstrate that fast IPSCs and slow IPSCs contribute to Golgi cell inhibition of granule cells differentially betwee"
https://openalex.org/W2039559057,"Background Electronic patient records from primary care databases are increasingly used in public health and health services research but methods used to identify cases with disease are not well described. This study aimed to evaluate the relevance of different codes for the identification of acute stroke in a primary care database, and to evaluate trends in the use of different codes over time. Methods Data were obtained from the General Practice Research Database from 1997 to 2006. All subjects had a minimum of 24 months of up-to-standard record before the first recorded stroke diagnosis. Initially, we identified stroke cases using a supplemented version of the set of codes for prevalent stroke used by the Office for National Statistics in Key health statistics from general practice 1998 (ONS codes). The ONS codes were then independently reviewed by four raters and a restricted set of 121 codes for ‘acute stroke’ was identified but the kappa statistic was low at 0.23. Results Initial extraction of data using the ONS codes gave 48,239 cases of stroke from 1997 to 2006. Application of the restricted set of codes reduced this to 39,424 cases. There were 2,288 cases whose index medical codes were for ‘stroke annual review’ and 3,112 for ‘stroke monitoring’. The frequency of stroke review and monitoring codes as index codes increased from 9 per year in 1997 to 1,612 in 2004, 1,530 in 2005 and 1,424 in 2006. The one year mortality of cases with the restricted set of codes was 29.1% but for ‘stroke annual review,’ 4.6% and for ‘stroke monitoring codes’, 5.7%. Conclusion In the analysis of electronic patient records, different medical codes for a single condition may have varying clinical and prognostic significance; utilisation of different medical codes may change over time; researchers with differing clinical or epidemiological experience may have differing interpretations of the relevance of particular codes. There is a need for greater transparency in the selection of sets of codes for different conditions, for the reporting of sensitivity analyses using different sets of codes, as well as sharing of code sets among researchers."
https://openalex.org/W2026989559,"ASIC3 is an acid-sensing ion channel expressed in sensory neurons, where it participates in acidic and inflammatory pain. In addition to the ""classical"" transient current, ASIC3 generates a sustained current essential for pain perception. Using chimeras between the ASIC3 and ASIC1a channels we show that the first transmembrane domain (TM1), combined with the N-terminal domain, is the key structural element generating the low pH (<6.5)-evoked sustained current. The TM1 domain also modulates the pH-dependent activation of the fast transient current thus contributing to a constitutive window current, another type of sustained current present near physiological pH. The C-terminal and the TM2 domains negatively regulate both types of sustained current, and the extracellular loop affects its kinetics. These data provide new information to aid understanding the mechanisms of the multifaceted pH gating of ASIC3. Together with the peak current, both components of the sustained current (window and sustained at pH <6.5) allow ASIC3 to adapt its behavior to a wide range of extracellular pH variations by generating transient and/or sustained responses that contribute to nociceptor excitability."

Chronic changes in neuronal activity lead to an adaptive modulation in the efficacy of GABAergic synaptic inhibition, brought about in part by changes in the number of synaptic GABAARs, a mechanism known as homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Reduction in the number of GABAARs in response to prolonged neuronal activity blockade is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The underlying biochemical pathways linking chronic activity blockade to proteasome-dependent degradation of GABAARs are unknown. Here, we show that chronic blockade of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) with nifedipine decreases the number of GABAARs at synaptic sites but not the overall number of inhibitory synapses. In parallel, blockade of L-type VGCCs decreases the amplitude but not the frequency of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents or expression of the glutamic acid decarboxylase GAD65. We further reveal that the activation of L-type VGCCs regulates the turnover of newly translated GABAAR subunits in a mechanism dependent upon the activity of the proteasome and thus regulates GABAAR insertion into the plasma membrane.

The number of GABAARs on the neuronal cell surface is a critical determinant for the efficacy of synaptic inhibition and, at steady state, is determined by the rates of receptor insertion and removal from the plasma membrane (10.Kittler J.T.

Phosphorylation of the intracellular domains between transmembrane domains 3 and 4 of the GABAAR β and γ subunits by serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases has been shown to alter receptor function either by a direct effect on receptor properties, such as the probability of channel opening or desensitization, or by regulating trafficking of the receptor to and from the cell surface (11.Jacob T.C.

Neurosci. 2001; 2: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar).The activity of neurons in neural circuits is highly regulated, and when firing frequency either falls below or rises above normal physiological levels, compensatory mechanisms come into play to restore normal activity, a process known as homeostatic plasticity (13.Turrigiano G.G. Nelson S.B. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1695) Google Scholar, 14.Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2003; 13: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Homeostatic synaptic scaling is one homeostatic mechanism that involves uniform adjustments in the strength of all synapses in response to changes in activity while maintaining the individual weights between synapses (15.Turrigiano G.G. Leslie K.R. Desai N.S. Rutherford L.C. Nelson S.B. Nature. 1998; 391: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar, 16.Turrigiano G.G. Cell. 2008; 135: 422-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). GABA regulates the excitability of neural circuits, and a number of studies in cultures of dissociated neurons have provided evidence that chronic changes in neuronal activity can lead to homeostatic scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength (9.Saliba R.S.

There is now increasing evidence that homeostatic regulation of GABAergic synaptic strength is achieved by modulating the numbers of postsynaptic GABAARs (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J.

Furthermore, presynaptic changes underlying activity-dependent scaling of inhibitory synaptic strength have been reported in which the levels of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme GAD65, the GABA transporter, and presynaptic GABA content are modulated by activity (17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Hartman K.N. Pal S.K. Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Nat.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7121-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the modulation of synaptic GABAAR abundance in response to chronic changes in neuronal activity. However, it has been recently established that prolonged alteration in neuronal activity modulates the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of GABAARs in the ER, resulting in changes in the number of receptors at synaptic sites and the efficacy of synaptic inhibition (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).A number of important questions remain. For instance, how do chronic changes in activity translate into the homeostatic regulation of GABAAR abundance at synaptic sites? In this study, we have begun to investigate the role of Ca2+ influx through L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in the modulation of activity-dependent expression of GABAARs and the efficacy of synaptic inhibition.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have shown that prolonged blockade of Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs leads to reduced total and synaptic expression of GABAARs and diminished GABAergic synaptic transmission without affecting the levels of GAD65. Reduced GABAAR expression following L-type VGCC blockade is a result of increased turnover of de novo synthesized GABAARs, which is dependent on the activity of the proteasome. In addition, chronic blockade of Ca2+ influx reduces the insertion of GABAARs into the neuronal membrane. Overall, prolonged reduction in L-type Ca2+ influx decreases the numbers of synaptic GABAARs and reduces synaptic inhibition, highlighting a possible role for L-type VGCCs in the activity-dependent scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength.The number of GABAARs is a critical factor in determining the strength of GABAergic synaptic inhibition (35.Nusser Z. Cull-Candy S. Farrant M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 697-709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that prolonged changes in neuronal activity lead to an adaptive modulation of the numbers of GABAARs at synaptic sites and the efficacy of synaptic inhibition (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Swanwick C.C. Murthy N.R. Kapur J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2006; 31: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 36.Nusser Z. Hájos N. Somogyi P. Mody I. Nature. 1998; 395: 172-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Therefore, a critical expression locus of activity-dependent scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength is the postsynaptic change in GABAAR numbers. Furthermore, the direct ubiquitination of GABAARs and the ubiquitin-proteasome system play a critical role in the activity-dependent modulation of the abundance of these receptors at synaptic sites (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that blocking Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs in cultured hippocampal neurons mimics the effects of TTX on GABAAR turnover, accumulation at synaptic sites, and efficacy of synaptic inhibition (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that activity-dependent scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength is mediated in part by Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs. Interestingly, a recent report has shown that the increase in AMPA receptor number brought about by activity blockade with TTX is mediated by somatic Ca2+ influx and that TTX prevents these action potential-triggered Ca2+ transients in the cell soma (37.Ibata K. Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G. Neuron. 2008; 57: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, the effects of TTX on AMPA receptor accumulation could be partially mimicked by blocking L-type VGCCs, but the authors speculate that other VGCCs (T- and R-type) contribute to this phenomenon (37.Ibata K. Sun Q. Turrigiano G.G. Neuron. 2008; 57: 819-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs is critical for activity-dependent changes in the composition of AMPA receptors (33.Thiagarajan T.C. Lindskog M. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 2005; 47: 725-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Thus, these studies highlight the importance of L-type Ca2+ influx in the homeostatic scaling of glutamatergic synaptic strength.In addition to the changes in abundance of GABAARs, a number of presynaptic factors also determine GABAergic synaptic strength. We did not observe a change in GAD65 expression or the frequency of mIPSCs when L-type Ca2+ influx was blocked. This is in stark contrast to the presynaptic changes that have been reported when neuronal activity was blocked with TTX. Activity blockade in cultured neurons with TTX induces down-regulation of GAD65 and vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter expression (17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Hartman K.N. Pal S.K. Burrone J. Murthy V.N. Nat.

Neurosci. 2005; 25: 7121-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), reduces the number of GABAergic synapses (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and results in a smaller mIPSC frequency (9.Saliba R.S. Michels G. Jacob T.C. Pangalos M.N. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13341-13351Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 17.Kilman V. van Rossum M.C. Turrigiano G.G. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Ca2+ influx through L-type VGCCs may be responsible for only mediating activity-dependent postsynaptic changes in GABAergic synaptic strength. However, it appears that other mechanisms regulate presynaptic factors governing the homeostatic scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength. Perhaps activity-dependent changes in the expression of GAD65 are mediated by Ca2+ influx through NMDA receptors and not L-type VGCCs, as one report has shown that NMDA receptor activation dominates Ca2+ influx in interneurons (38.Goldberg J.H. Yuste R. Tamas G. J. Physiol. 2003; 551: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and that chronic blockade of NMDA receptors reduces GAD67 expression (39.Kinney J.W. Davis C.N. Tabarean I. Conti B. Bartfai T. Behrens M.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 1604-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).This study has begun to delineate the biochemical pathways underlying the scaling of the strength of GABAergic synaptic neurotransmission. However, there are a number of unanswered questions. For instance, we have revealed that Ca2+ influx can regulate the turnover of GABAARs, but the exact processes leading to the modulation of receptor turnover and insertion still remain to be determined but could possibly involve Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of GABAAR subunits and subsequent modulation of receptor ER export/degradation.In conclusion, this study has demonstrated the importance of L-type Ca2+ influx in regulating the abundance of GABAARs at synaptic sites and the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of Ca2+ signaling in mediating activity-dependent scaling of GABAergic synaptic strength.

https://openalex.org/W2055074822,"Detachment of non-malignant epithelial cells from the extracellular matrix causes their growth arrest and, ultimately, death. By contrast, cells composing carcinomas, cancers of epithelial origin, can survive and proliferate without being attached to the extracellular matrix. These properties of tumor cells represent hallmarks of malignant transformation and are critical for cancer progression. Previously we identified several mechanisms by which ras, a major oncogene, blocks detachment-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells, but mechanisms by which Ras promotes proliferation of those cells that remain viable following detachment are unknown. We show here that detachment of non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells promotes formation of autophagosomes, vacuole-like structures that mediate autophagy (a process of cellular self-cannibalization), and that oncogenic ras prevents this autophagosome formation. We also found that ras activates a GTPase RhoA, that RhoA promotes activation of a protease calpain, and that calpain triggers degradation of Beclin-1, a critical mediator of autophagy, in these cells. The reversal of the effect of ras on Beclin-1 (achieved by expression of exogenous Beclin-1) promoted autophagosome formation following cell detachment, significantly reduced the fraction of detached cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and their rate of proliferation without affecting their viability. Furthermore, RNA interference-induced Beclin-1 down-regulation in non-malignant intestinal epithelial cells prevented detachment-dependent reduction of the fraction of these cells in the S phase of the cell cycle. Thus, ras oncogene promotes proliferation of those malignant intestinal epithelial cells that remain viable following detachment via a distinct novel mechanism that involves Ras-induced down-regulation of Beclin-1."
https://openalex.org/W1986255753,"Background To clarify the role of the POU domain transcription factor Oct4 in Adipose Tissue Stromal Cells (ATSCs), we investigated the regulation of Oct4 expression and other embryonic genes in fully differentiated cells, in addition to identifying expression at the gene and protein levels. The ATSCs and several immature cells were routinely expressing Oct4 protein before and after differentiating into specific lineages. Methodology/Principal Findings and Conclusions Here, we demonstrated the role of Oct4 in ATSCs on cell proliferation and differentiation. Exogenous Oct4 improves adult ATSCs cell proliferation and differentiation potencies through epigenetic reprogramming of stemness genes such as Oct4, Nanog, Sox2, and Rex1. Oct4 directly or indirectly induces ATSCs reprogramming along with the activation of JAK/STAT3 and ERK1/2. Exogenic Oct4 introduced a transdifferentiation priority into the neural lineage than mesodermal lineage. Global gene expression analysis results showed that Oct4 regulated target genes which could be characterized as differentially regulated genes such as pluripotency markers NANOG, SOX2, and KLF4 and markers of undifferentiated stem cells FOXD1, CDC2, and EPHB1. The negatively regulated genes included FAS, TNFR, COL6A1, JAM2, FOXQ1, FOXO1, NESTIN, SMAD3, SLIT3, DKK1, WNT5A, BMP1, and GLIS3 which are implicated in differentiation processes as well as a number of novel genes. Finally we have demonstrated the therapeutic utility of Oct4/ATSCs were introduced into the mouse traumatic brain, engrafted cells was more effectively induces regeneration activity with high therapeutic modality than that of control ATSCs. Engrafted Oct4/ATSCs efficiently migrated and transdifferentiated into action potential carrying, functionally neurons in the hippocampus and promoting the amelioration of lesion cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2032167415,"The Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) is a higher-order visual interneuron of Orthopteran insects that responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course. It receives excitatory input from an entire visual hemifield that anatomical evidence suggests is retinotopic. We show that this excitatory projection activates calcium-permeable nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. In vivo calcium imaging reveals that the excitatory projection preserves retinotopy down to the level of a single ommatidium. Examining the impact of retinotopy on the LGMD's computational properties, we show that sublinear synaptic summation can explain orientation preference in this cell. Exploring retinotopy's impact on directional selectivity leads us to infer that the excitatory input to the LGMD is intrinsically directionally selective. Our results show that precise retinotopy has implications for the dendritic integration of visual information in a single neuron."

This work dissects the pathway leading to cPLA2α activation and LD biogenesis. Both processes were Ca2+-independent, as they took place after pharmacological blockade of Ca2+ transients elicited by serum or chelation with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester). The single mutation D43N in cPLA2α, which abrogates its Ca2+ binding capacity and translocation to membranes, did not affect enzyme activation and formation of LD. In contrast, the mutation S505A did not affect membrane relocation of the enzyme in response to Ca2+ but prevented its phosphorylation, activation, and the appearance of LD. Expression of specific activators of different mitogen-activated protein kinases showed that phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 is due to JNK. This was confirmed by pharmacological inhibition and expression of a dominant-negative form of the upstream activator MEKK1. LD biogenesis was accompanied by increased synthesis of ceramide 1-phosphate. Overexpression of its synthesizing enzyme ceramide kinase increased phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 and formation of LD, and its down-regulation blocked the phosphorylation of cPLA2α and LD biogenesis.

Cells generate LD from exogenous sources, free fatty acids or lipoproteins, but LD also appear in the absence of external lipids when cells are under stress, apparently after the recycling of membrane phospholipids into TAG (7.Gubern A.

Regardless of the LD-inducing situation, the enzyme is not involved in the synthesis of neutral lipids; rather, it allows the formation of LD from TAG-containing membranes. cPLA2α can be activated by several mechanisms (reviewed in Refs. 11.Ghosh M.

It contains a Ca2+ binding domain (C2) that allows interaction with membrane phospholipids in response to increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, and the single substitution D43N in this domain abrogates the Ca2+-dependent translocation of cPLA2α to membranes (13.Qiu Z.H.

Also, phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser residues 505, 515, and 727 appears to play a role in enzyme activation (11.Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog.

Among these sites, it is generally accepted that Ser-505 is the one that leads to increased catalytic activity (26.Pavicevic Z. Leslie C.C. Malik K.U. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 724-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of Ser-505 depends on MAPK, among which most reports implicate ERK and p38 (11.Ghosh M.

Recently, we have shown that phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 is key for LD biogenesis, as evidenced by the inability of the S505A mutant to recapitulate the effect of the endogenous enzyme (10.Gubern A.

This work was undertaken to delineate the mechanism of cPLA2α activation that generates LD in the cell after serum addition. In essence, we show that the activation of cPLA2α is independent of increases of intracellular Ca2+; furthermore, we identify JNK as the MAPK implicated in cPLA2α activation. Finally, we show that ceramide kinase (CERK), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of Cer-1-P, mediates LD biogenesis by inducing the phosphorylation of cPLA2α by JNK.

Cell passages were made once a week by trypsinization. For the experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 30,000 cells/ml in 24-well (0.5 ml) or 6-well plates (2 ml) and maintained in FBS-containing medium during 48 h. Before LD induction, cells were switched to serum-free culture medium for 24 h to set control conditions with minimal occurrence of LD (7.Gubern A. Barceló-Torns M. Casas J. Barneda D. Masgrau R.

Cells grown onto polylysine-coated coverslips were incubated with the Ca2+ indicator Fura-2/AM at 4 μm in Krebs buffer of the following composition (in mm): 119 NaCl, 4.75 KCl, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.18 KH2PO4, 1.3 CaCl2, 20 Hepes, and 5 glucose, pH 7.4. After 1 h, cells were washed and coverslips mounted in a static chamber on an inverted Nikon TE2000U microscope with a conventional epifluorescence system. Cells were excited alternatively at 340 and 380 nm, and emission light was collected at 510 nm every 4–10 s using a 12-bit CCD ERG ORCA Hamamatsu camera. Ratio image of cells was analyzed using the Metafluor software (Universal Imaging). 14–20 cells were analyzed in each experiment. Cells were lysed with 62.5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue, and around 20 μg of protein were separated by standard 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Primary (1:1,000) and secondary antibodies (1:5,000) were diluted in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl, 10% defatted dry milk, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Antibody binding was detected using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences) and visualized using a GeneGenome HR chemiluminescence detection system coupled to a CCD camera or with high performance chemiluminescence films (Amersham Biosciences). We used three short interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes from Gene Link, targeting accession number NM_022766 (human CERK mRNA): CERK1-(537), CERK2-(1377), and CERK3-(1679), with the following sequences: 5′- GGACAAGGCAAGCGGATAUTT (sense) and 5′-TTCCUGUUCCGUUCGCCUAUA (antisense) for siRNA CERK1; 5′-CGGAAAUGCUCCAGGUUCATT (sense) and 5′-TTGCCUUUACGAGGUCCAAGU (antisense) for siRNA CERK2; and 5′-ACGAGGAAUUGAAGAGAAUTT (sense) and 5′- TTUGCUCCUUAACUUCUCUUA (antisense) for siRNA CERK3. Cells were transfected at 60% confluence with 30 nm siRNA, by adding to each 35-mm culture well 1 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) containing 1.5 μl of the stock siRNA solution (20 μm) and 5 μl of Lipofectamine PlusTM (1 mg/ml, from Invitrogen). After 5 h, 1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium containing 7.5% FBS was added, and the cells were incubated for 72 h and then changed to serum-free medium during 24 h prior to treatments. When appropriate, labeling with [3H]palmitate to monitor the formation of Cer-1-P was done in the last 24 h. [3H]Palmitate-prelabeled cells were stimulated with 7.5% FBS during 15 min, harvested on ice, washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and centrifuged prior to extraction of lipids (28.Bligh E.G.

To separate Cer-1-P, 0.2-ml aliquots of the chloroform phases were evaporated under vacuum, dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform/methanol (3:1, v/v), and spotted onto Silica Gel G thin layer chromatography plates (Merck), which were developed once in chloroform/methanol/water (67.5:28.4:4, v/v) and three times in hexane/diethyl ether/formic acid (55:45:1, v/v). After staining with primuline spray (5 mg of primuline in 100 ml of acetone/water (80:20, v/v), identification of ceramide and ceramide 1-phosphate was made by co-migration with authentic standards. To quantify [3H]Cer-1-P, silica in regions of the TLC plates co-migrating with standard Cer-1-P was scraped into vials, which after addition of scintillation mixture were counted in a Tri-Carb 2810TR (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 40% efficiency. Transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells were treated for 10 min with 5 μm ionomycin.

Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2706-2716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Data analysis was carried out with Prism software (GraphPad). Responses among different treatments were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. All experiments were carried out with determinations in triplicate. Most results are presented as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, except those in Fig. 8B, which are means ± range of two experiments. Results shown as fluorescence Ca2+ signals, Western blots, or microphotographs are representative of at least three independent experiments with essentially the same outcome. Serum-starved cells challenged with 7.5% FBS produced transient Ca2+ increases (Fig. 1A). As expected, this Ca2+ signal disappeared when cells were pretreated with 45 μm BAPTA-AM during 30 min prior to stimulation with FBS (Fig. 1A). The inhibitory effect of BAPTA-AM was confirmed after the inability of ionomycin to induce a Ca2+ response (data not shown). cPLA2α was phosphorylated upon FBS stimulation when intracellular Ca2+ increases were abrogated by BAPTA-AM (Fig. 1B), and in fact, cPLA2α activity, measured as [3H]AA release to the medium, was unaffected by intracellular Ca2+ chelation (Fig. 1D). This Ca2+-chelating strategy was toxic over 6 h, however, and did not allow us to measure LD levels, which we usually monitor after a 6-h treatment (7.Gubern A. Barceló-Torns M. Casas J. Barneda D.

Instead, we used the phosphoinositide phospholipase C inhibitor U73122 to block the Ca2+ signals induced by FBS, which are due to the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (30.Sun X. Mörk A.C. Helmke R.J. Martinez J.R. Zhang G.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 458-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, pretreatment with 10 μm U73122 blocked the Ca2+ response, but it did not affect phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 (Fig. 1C) or [3H]AA releasing activity (Fig. 1D). Importantly, in the presence of the phospholipase C inhibitor, FBS still promoted ADRP expression (Fig. 1C) and LD biogenesis that was sensitive to the cPLA2α inhibitor MAFP (Fig. 1E). Additional evidence for a Ca2+-independent activation of cPLA2α during LD biogenesis came from the transfection of a D43N-cPLA2α mutant. Asp-43 resides in the Ca2+-binding loop 1 at the membrane binding face of the C2 domain of the enzyme and participates in the coordination of the two Ca2+ ions that drive membrane binding (11.Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Substitution of this residue for Asn increases 100-fold the Ca2+ requirement for activity in vitro (31.Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and it prevents translocation of the enzyme to membranes in response to Ca2+ ionophores (15.Perisic O.

In agreement with this, EGFP-D43N-cPLA2α did not relocate in CHO-K1 cells stimulated with 5 μm ionomycin, unlike the wild type enzyme, which translocated to perinuclear membranes and structures resembling the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2, A–D). In contrast, EGFP-S505A-cPLA2α, which lacks the Ser-505 phosphorylation site but retains its Ca2+ binding capacity, translocated to membranes in response to ionomycin just as the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2, E and F). Importantly, FBS treatment induced phosphorylation of wild type and D43N cPLA2α, at Ser-505 (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, transfection of EGFP-D43N-cPLA2α resulted in increased release of [3H]AA (Fig. 2H), both under basal conditions and upon FBS stimulation, to the same levels achieved by transfection of EGFP-cPLA2α. Regarding LD occurrence, the effect of the D43N mutant was identical to the wild type enzyme; there was a 2.5-fold increase of LD upon FBS stimulation, monitored either by flow cytometry (Fig. 2I), ADRP content (data not shown), or by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 2, J and K). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the activation of cPLA2α and biogenesis of LD induced by FBS are independent of Ca2+ and do not require massive relocation of the enzyme. Furthermore, the results confirm our previous finding that phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 is essential for its activation by FBS, although there is no apparent relocation in response to the faint Ca2+ signal elicited by the stimulus (10.Gubern A. Casas J. Barceló-Torns M. Barneda D. de la Rosa X. Masgrau R. Picatoste F. Balsinde J. Balboa M.A. Claro E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27369-27382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). cPLA2α is phosphorylated at Ser-505 by MAPKs (11.Ghosh M. Tucker D.E. Burchett S.A. Leslie C.C. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 487-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12.Burke J.E. Dennis E.A. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2009; 23: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), and to dissect the pathway during LD biogenesis, we monitored JNK, p38, and ERK MAPKs at different times after FBS replacement. As shown in Fig. 3, all three MAPKs became activated after stimulation with 7.5% FBS. We therefore activated each MAPK individually by transfecting constitutively active upstream activators of each pathway. As shown in Fig. 4A, transfection of the catalytic domain of MEKK1, which encodes a constitutively active kinase (ΔMEKK1), induced phosphorylation of JNK in the absence of FBS stimulus, but not of ERK, and only a slight increase of p38. Likewise, transfection of MKK3EE and MEK1EE resulted in the specific phosphorylation of p38 and ERK, respectively, in the absence of FBS. Importantly, only the activation of JNK increased phosphorylation of cPLA2α at Ser-505 (Fig. 4A), and this was inhibited in the presence of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 at 10 μm (data not shown). ΔMEKK1-JNK-mediated phosphorylation of cPLA2α was mirrored by an increased [3H]AA-releasing activity in the absence of FBS stimulus, which again was inhibited by SP600125 and also by MAFP (Fig. 4B). In contrast, [3H]AA released from cells transfected either with MKK3EE or MEK1EE was not different from that in control cells (Fig. 4B). In close agreement with data on cPLA2α phosphorylation and activity, Fig. 4C shows that cells transfected with ΔMEKK1 had increased LD content as monitored by flow cytometry. In contrast, stimulation of p38 or ERK did not induce the formation of LD. Again, LD biogenesis induced by expression of ΔMEKK1 in the absence of FBS stimulus was sensitive to inhibition by SP600125 and MAFP.FIGURE 4Activation of JNK, but not of p38 or ERK, is sufficient to phosphorylate cPLA2α and induce LD biogenesis in the absence of FBS. CHO-K1 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding ΔMEKK1, MEKK3EE, or MEK1EE and switched to culture medium without FBS.

https://openalex.org/W2043513276,"Plus end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are a unique group of microtubule binding proteins that dynamically track microtubule (MT) plus ends. EB1 is a highly conserved +TIP with a fundamental role in MT dynamics, but it remains poorly understood in part because reported EB1 activities have differed considerably. One reason for this inconsistency could be the variable presence of affinity tags used for EB1 purification. To address this question and establish the activity of native EB1, we have measured the MT binding and tubulin polymerization activities of untagged EB1 and EB1 fragments and compared them with those of His-tagged EB1 proteins. We found that N-terminal His tags directly influence the interaction between EB1 and MTs, significantly increasing both affinity and activity, and that small amounts of His-tagged proteins act synergistically with larger amounts of untagged proteins. Moreover, the binding ratio between EB1 and tubulin can exceed 1:1, and EB1-MT binding curves do not fit simple binding models. These observations demonstrate that EB1 binding is not limited to the MT seam, and they suggest that EB1 binds cooperatively to MTs. Finally, we found that removal of tubulin C-terminal tails significantly reduces EB1 binding, indicating that EB1-tubulin interactions are mediated in part by the same tubulin acidic tails utilized by other MAPs. These binding relationships are important for helping to elucidate the complex of proteins at the MT tip."
https://openalex.org/W2093740502,"Recent works suggest that one of the roles of gap junctions in sensory systems is to enhance their dynamic range by avoiding early saturation in the first processing stages. In this work, we use a minimal conductance-based model of the ON rod pathways in the vertebrate retina to study the effects of electrical synaptic coupling via gap junctions among rods and among AII amacrine cells on the dynamic range of the retina. The model is also used to study the effects of the maximum conductance of rod hyperpolarization activated current Ih on the dynamic range of the retina, allowing a study of the interrelations between this intrinsic membrane parameter with those two retina connectivity characteristics. Our results show that for realistic values of Ih conductance the dynamic range is enhanced by rod-rod coupling, and that AII-AII coupling is less relevant to dynamic range amplification in comparison with receptor coupling. Furthermore, a plot of the retina output response versus input intensity for the optimal parameter configuration is well fitted by a power law with exponent . The results are consistent with predictions of more theoretical works and suggest that the earliest expression of gap junctions along the rod pathways, together with appropriate values of rod Ih conductance, has the highest impact on vertebrate retina dynamic range enhancement."

https://openalex.org/W2003331776,"HEAT and ARM repeats occur in a large number of eukaryotic proteins. As these repeats are often highly diverged, the prediction of HEAT or ARM domains can be challenging. Except for the most clear-cut cases, identification at the individual repeat level is indispensable, in particular for determining domain boundaries. However, methods using single sequence queries do not have the sensitivity required to deal with more divergent repeats and, when applied to proteins with known structures, in some cases failed to detect a single repeat.Testing algorithms which use multiple sequence alignments as queries, we found two of them, HHpred and COACH, to detect HEAT and ARM repeats with greatly enhanced sensitivity. Calibration against experimentally determined structures suggests the use of three score classes with increasing confidence in the prediction, and prediction thresholds for each method. When we applied a new protocol using both HHpred and COACH to these structures, it detected 82% of HEAT repeats and 90% of ARM repeats, with the minimum for a given protein of 57% for HEAT repeats and 60% for ARM repeats. Application to bona fide HEAT and ARM proteins or domains indicated that similar numbers can be expected for the full complement of HEAT/ARM proteins. A systematic screen of the Protein Data Bank for false positive hits revealed their number to be low, in particular for ARM repeats. Double false positive hits for a given protein were rare for HEAT and not at all observed for ARM repeats. In combination with fold prediction and consistency checking (multiple sequence alignments, secondary structure prediction, and position analysis), repeat prediction with the new HHpred/COACH protocol dramatically improves prediction in the twilight zone of fold prediction methods, as well as the delineation of HEAT/ARM domain boundaries.A protocol is presented for the identification of individual HEAT or ARM repeats which is straightforward to implement. It provides high sensitivity at a low false positive rate and will therefore greatly enhance the accuracy of predictions of HEAT and ARM domains."
https://openalex.org/W2023892358,"Since their onset, display technologies have proven useful for the selection of antibodies against a variety of targets; however, most of the antibodies selected with the currently available platforms need to be further modified for their use in humans, and are restricted to accessible antigens. Furthermore, these platforms are not well suited for in vivo selections. We present here a novel cell based antibody display platform, which takes advantage of the functional capabilities of T lymphocytes. The display of antibodies on the surface of T lymphocytes, as a part of a chimeric-immune receptor (CIR) mediating signaling, may ideally link the antigen-antibody interaction to a demonstrable change in T cell phenotype, due to subsequent expression of the early T cell activation marker CD69. In this proof-of-concept, an in vitro selection was carried out using a human T cell line lentiviral-transduced to express a tumor-specific CIR on the surface, against a human tumor cell line expressing the carcinoembryonic antigen. Based on an effective interaction between the CIR and the tumor antigen, we demonstrated that combining CIR-mediated activation with FACS sorting of CD69(+) T cells, it is possible to isolate binders to tumor specific cell surface antigen, with an enrichment factor of at least 10(3)-fold after two rounds, resulting in a homogeneous population of T cells expressing tumor-specific CIRs."

Here, a competition assay based on 1-aminoanthracene and apoferritin has been taken to a high throughput screening level, and validated using the LOPAC1280 library of drug-like compounds. A raw hit rate of ∼15% was reduced through the use of computational filters to yield an overall hit rate of ∼1%. These hits were validated using isothermal titration calorimetry.

https://openalex.org/W2065279121,"The RNase H activity of reverse transcriptase carries out three types of cleavage termed internal, RNA 5′ end-directed, and DNA 3′ end-directed. Given the strong association between the polymerase domain of reverse transcriptase and a DNA 3′ primer terminus, we asked whether the distance from the primer terminus is paramount for positioning DNA 3′ end-directed cleavages or whether preferred sequences and/or a cleavage window are important as they are for RNA 5′ end-directed cleavages. Using the reverse transcriptases of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) and Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), we determined the effects of sequence, distance, and substrate end structure on DNA 3′ end-directed cleavages. Utilizing sequence-matched substrates, our analyses showed that DNA 3′ end-directed cleavages share the same sequence preferences as RNA 5′ end-directed cleavages, but the sites must fall in a narrow window between the 15th and 20th nucleotides from the recessed end for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and between the 17th and 20th nucleotides for M-MuLV. Substrates with an RNA 5′ end recessed by 1 (HIV-1) or 2–3 (M-MuLV) bases on a longer DNA could accommodate both types of end-directed cleavage, but further recession of the RNA 5′ end excluded DNA 3′ end-directed cleavages. For HIV-1 RNase H, the inclusion of the cognate dNTP enhanced DNA 3′ end-directed cleavages at the 17th and 18th nucleotides. These data demonstrate that all three modes of retroviral RNase H cleavage share sequence determinants that may be useful in designing assays to identify inhibitors of retroviral RNases H."
