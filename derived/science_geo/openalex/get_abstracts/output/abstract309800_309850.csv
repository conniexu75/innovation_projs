https://openalex.org/W2054096803,"The filamentous fungal ascomycete Colletotrichum magna causes anthracnose in cucurbit plants. Isolation of a nonpathogenic mutant of this species (path-1) resulted in maintained wild-type levels of in vitro sporulation, spore adhesion, appressorial formation, and infection. Path-1 grew throughout host tissues as an endophyte and retained the wild-type host range, which indicates that the genetics involved in pathogenicity and host specificity are distinct. Prior infection with path-1 protected plants from disease caused by Colletotrichum and Fusarium.Genetic analysis of a cross between path-1 and wild-type strains indicated mutation of a single locus."

These results, in conjunction with those from previous studies, imply that dissolved organic compounds and transition metals such as iron ions are involved in the photochemical formation of hydrogen peroxide and other photooxidants in atmospheric waters."
https://openalex.org/W2082923816,Computer compilation of the probability of firing of a single cell in cat cortex following a physiological sensory stimulus (somatic or light flash) indicates that the frequency distribution of the firing of a single cell closely corresponds to the average waveform of the evoked potential recorded from the same microelectrode. This high correlation holds for both positive and negative and early and late components of the evoked response.
https://openalex.org/W2063439467,The ratios of potassium to rubidium determined for a series of oceanic volcanic rocks suggest that the K/Rb ratio of the upper mantle exceeds 1500. The similarity between this inferred K/Rb ratio for the mantle and that found in some achondritic meteorites suggests a similar overall composition for these materials.
https://openalex.org/W2026382406,"Some transitions in germanium and other semiconductor systems have been detected after very long exposure to high pressures followed by various quenching techniques. In the case of Ge, a new high-pressure polymorph, Ge-IV, has been synthesized above 110 kilobars with a body-centered-cubic structure. The pressure for the Ge-I right harpoon-up Ge-III (body-centered-tetragonal structure) transition has been revised from about 120 to 25 kilobars at 30 degrees C. The transition from the Ge-I (diamond structure) to the Ge-II (white tin structure) is metastable up to 140 kilobars. Thus some phase diagrams based on discontinuities observed in essentially dynamic systems may be inaccurate."

The essential component of the treatment appears to be mechanical stimulation by a water current."

https://openalex.org/W2019424240,"The gas chromatographicmass spectrometric technique recently developed by Ryhage has been applied to the analysis of paraffins extracted from pasture plants, specifically, whole plant and leaves of spotted bur clover (Medicago arabica). Normal alkanes from C(18) to C(35) have been found. The C(29), C(31), and C(33) normal saturated hydrocarbons predominate and n-C(31) is the major component. In the range from C(24) to C(34) the ratio of alkanes with an even number of carbon atoms to those with an odd number is approximately 8 for the whole plant and 5 for the leaves. The distribution of paraffins is similar to that reported for cattle manure and also resembles that of some soils and sediments."
https://openalex.org/W2041922732,"Structural modification of photosynthetic reaction centers is an important approach for understanding their charge-separation processes. An unprecedented persistent structural transformation of the special pair (dimer) of bacteriochlorophyll molecules can be produced by light absorption alone. The nonphotochemical hole-burned spectra for the reaction center of Rhodopseudomonas viridis show that the phototransformation leads to a red shift of 150 wave numbers for the special pair's lowest energy absorption band, P960, and a comparable blue shift for a state at 850 nanometers, which can now be definitively assigned as being most closely associated with the upper dimer component. Additional insights on excited-state electronic structure include the identification of a new state."
https://openalex.org/W2049561125,"With laser-assisted chemical vapor deposition, strong and flexible carbon fibers were obtained at high reaction chamber pressures (> 1 bar) with growth rates > 0.3 millimeter per second; their tensile strength (3 gigapascals) approaches that of commercial intermediate modulus carbon fibers made by conventional process routes. With the process described here, carbon fibers can be produced with superior chemical purity and structural uniformity. They may become the material of choice in currently emerging premium end uses, including carbon fiber infrared detection elements."

https://openalex.org/W2053044325,"The residual displacement field indicates that the primary fault responsible for the great Alaskan earthquake extended to depths of 100 to 200 kilometers and came to within 15 kilometers of the surface. The vertical extent is an order of magnitude greater than reported for all other earthquakes. Approximately 10(25) ergs of elastic strain energy was released. About 12,000 aftershocks (M(L) >/= 3.5) probably occurred in a 69-day period after the main shock. One-half the strain rebound occurred the first day with the main shock contributing one-fourth of the total."
https://openalex.org/W2087936380,Data from two almost simultaneous balloon soundings show that ozone and dust in combination are transported from their stratospheric reservoirs into the troposphere by way of thin laminae measuring about 1 kilometer vertically by at least 480 kilometers horizontally. Transport in this layer occurs across the top of the jet stream in a region of very great vertical wind shear. Stratospheric aerosol may be an important instrument for the destruction of ozone within the stratosphere.
https://openalex.org/W1978638686,"The silicones are in most cases relatively complex mixtures rather than pure molecular species. Their structures and chemical properties can be controlled, however, with sufficient reproducibility to give compositions with unique characteristics. The organic groups serve not only as a device for controlling the siloxane structures, but offer an important means of modifying the physical and chemical properties. Studies of the inductive effects in the organosilicon compounds enhance our understanding of the nature of chemical bonds. In each field of application an extensive technology has developed for the adaptation of silicones to special needs. The possibility of new compositions to serve science and technology seems to be unlimited."

https://openalex.org/W2002541821,"EARLY in April last, while my son, Malcolm Thomson, was operating, in a building of the River Works plant of the General Electric Co., a resistance welder for closing the seams of steel Langmuir mercury vacuum pumps, in which work the current is applied and cut off at about one-half second intervals, there was noticed by one of the working force, Mr. Davis, who happened to be favourably located, a peculiar intermittent illumination of the space near the welder as the current went on and off. My son at once placed himself in a similar position and saw the novel effect, and noted a number of conditions accompanying it, perhaps the most important being that a single-turn loop from the welding transformer to the work and back was carrying about 7000 amperes, and that the luminous effect was spread in the space in which would be located the magnetic field from this loop; that the sunlight was entering the building through high windows and shining across the space in which the field was produced at intervals; that the effect was most conspicuous when one looked towards the shadows and across the sunbeams, and also across the magnetic field."
