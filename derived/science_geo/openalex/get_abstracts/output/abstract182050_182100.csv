https://openalex.org/W1986996580,"OPA1 encodes a large GTPase related to dynamins, anchored to the mitochondrial cristae inner membrane, facing the intermembrane space. OPA1haplo-insufficiency is responsible for the most common form of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (ADOA, MIM165500), a neuropathy resulting from degeneration of the retinal ganglion cells and optic nerve atrophy. Here we show that down-regulation of OPA1 in HeLa cells using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) leads to fragmentation of the mitochondrial network concomitantly to the dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and to a drastic disorganization of the cristae. These events are followed by cytochromec release and caspase-dependent apoptotic nuclear events. Similarly, in NIH-OVCAR-3 cells, the OPA1 siRNA induces mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, the latter being inhibited by Bcl2 overexpression. These results suggest that OPA1 is a major organizer of the mitochondrial inner membrane from which the maintenance of the cristae integrity depends. As loss of OPA1 commits cells to apoptosis without any other stimulus, we propose that OPA1 is involved in the cytochrome c sequestration and might be a target for mitochondrial apoptotic effectors. Our results also suggest that abnormal apoptosis is a possible pathophysiological process leading to the retinal ganglion cells degeneration in ADOA patients.

Hinshaw J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 454-460Google Scholar, 7van der Bliek A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 96-102Google Scholar). Two dynamin subfamilies are specifically involved in the mitochondrial network morphology. One comprises the Dnm1/Drp1 protein that is located on the cytoplasmic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OM)1 to control the network fission process (8Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Google Scholar, 9Smirnova E. Shurland D.L. Ryazantsev S.N. van der Bliek A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 351-358Google Scholar). The second one includes the intra-mitochondrial Mgm1p/Msp1/OPA1 protein, which is required for the maintenance of the mitochondrial structure and genome in yeasts (10Jones B.A. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 380-389Google Scholar, 11Pelloquin L. Belenguer P. Menon Y. Gas N. Ducommun B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4151-4161Google Scholar, 12Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Google Scholar). Localization of this dynamin in the different species remains controversial and so does its precise function on the mitochondrial membranes. Mgm1 has been first localized anchored to the OM facing the cytoplasm (12Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Google Scholar), then in the intermembrane space (IMS) associated to the inner membrane (IM) (13Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Google Scholar). Msp1 has been located in the matrix anchored to the IM (11Pelloquin L. Belenguer P. Menon Y. Gas N. Ducommun B. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4151-4161Google Scholar). Finally OPA1 has been recently located to the IMS anchored on the cristae IM (1Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Google Scholar). We have previously shown that mutations in the OPA1 gene induce the most common form of autosomal dominant optic atrophy (2Alexander C. Votruba M. Pesch U.E. Thiselton D.L. Mayer S. Moore A.

Genet. 2000; 26: 207-210Google Scholar) (ADOA, MIM165500) and affect the structure of the mitochondrial network in monocytes from ADOA patients (3Delettre C. Lenaers G. Griffoin J.M. Gigarel N. Lorenzo C. Belenguer P. Pelloquin L. Grosgeorge J. Turc-Carel C. Perret E. Astarie- Dequeker C. Lasquellec L. Arnaud B. Ducommun B. Kaplan J. Hamel C.P. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 207-210Google Scholar). The possible function of OPA1 as a mechano-enzyme (14Stowell M.H. Marks B. Wigge P. McMahon H.T. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 27-32Google Scholar) or as a molecular switch (15Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. Traffic. 2000; 1: 385-392Google Scholar) acting on the IM suggests that it might be involved in the structure and dynamic of the cristae (16Mannella C.A. Pfeiffer D.R. Bradshaw P.C. Moraru I.I. Slepchenko B. Loew L.M. Hsieh C.E. Buttle K. Marko M. Dig. Liver Dis. 2001; 33: 795-802Google Scholar) and therefore on mitochondrial activity. In metazoan vertebrates, cristae structures have a crucial role as they define intra-cristae volumes that segregate the majority of the cytochrome c (cyt c) from the IMS (17Bernardi P. Azzone G.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7187-7192Google Scholar). In vitro, upon addition of the pro-apoptotic factor tBid on purified mitochondria, this pool of cyt c is released in the IMS by a major cristae remodeling process, which allows in vivo the extensive release of the cyt c in the cytoplasm to trigger apoptosis (18Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Google Scholar). To address OPA1 function on the mitochondrial membranes and gain insight into the pathophysiological mechanism of ADOA, we have analyzed the OPA1 knock-down in culture cells and found that it disrupts the mitochondrial IM structure and functional integrity and leads to cyt c release and apoptosis. OPA1 antibodies have been described previously (1Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Google Scholar). Commercial antibodies were from the sources indicated: anti-HSP60 (LK2, Sigma), anti-Actin (Chemicon), anti-cytochrome c(Santa Cruz), anti-cleaved PARP (Promega), Alexa-594 anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa-488 anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes), and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (New England Biolabs). HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 5% CO2. NIH-OVCAR-3 cells (19Lafon C. Mathieu C. Guerrin M. Pierre O. Vidal S. Valette A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1095-1104Google Scholar) were cultured in RPMI, 5% fetal calf serum, 5% CO2. siRNA experiments were carried out as described previously (20Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Google Scholar). The sequence of the region targeted by the OPA1-siRNA (Dharmacond Research), 5′-AAGTTATCAGTCTGAGCCAGGTT-3′, corresponds to nucleotides 1810–1833 of OPA1 open reading frame (GenBankTM accession numberAB011139) and is present in all OPA1 alternate splicing variants (21Delettre C. Griffoin J.M. Kaplan J. Dollfus H. Lorenz B. Faivre L. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. Hamel C.P. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 584-591Google Scholar). Transfections of HeLa cells were performed with Oligofectamine® reagent (Invitrogen). Final concentration of the siRNA duplex in culture medium was 100 nm. Control experiments included treatments of cells with 100 μm z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) for 48 h or 5 μm CDDP (Sigma) for 24 h. To detect OPA1 and actin by Western blot, transfected cells were trypsinized, washed once in ice-cold PBS, and harvested. Equal amounts of cells were solubilized in 50 μl of Laemmeli sample buffer and boiled for 10 min. Samples were run on 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunodetection (anti-OPA1: 1/300; anti-actin: 1/10000; IgG-HRP: 1/10,000) was carried out using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). PARP detection was performed according to the protocol from Promega (anti-PARP: 1/1000). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in PBS, 3.7% paraformaldehyde (30 min, 4 °C), permeated in 100% methanol (1 min, −20 °C), then in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 (10 min, room temperature) and immunolabeled in PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, using the following antibodies (HSP60: 1/100; cytochrome c: 1/100; Alexa-594 anti-rabbit IgG: 1/500; Alexa-488 anti-mouse IgG: 1/500) and stained with DAPI (0.1 μg/ml). To quantify phenotypes, cells were stained directly in the culture using 100 nm CMXros Mitotracker® Red (Molecular Probes) for 30 min, then fixed and DAPI-stained. To analyze the ΔΨm, cells were incubated 20 min with 5 μg/ml JC-1 (Molecular Probes) in culture medium and observed by confocal microscopy. Fluorescence images were captured and processed using a Leica DMIRE-2 microscope or a LSM-410 Zeiss confocal microscope. For FACS analyses of the ΔΨm, cells were removed from the culture dishes and then pelleted by low centrifugation, resuspended in culture medium with 50 nm TMRE (Molecular Probes) (22Castedo M. Ferri K. Roumier T. Metivier D. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 265: 39-47Google Scholar), and analyzed 15 min later by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur, BD Biosciences) using the Cellquest software. Control experiments included treatment with 50 mm DNP (Sigma) for 60 min or 2 μm Oligomycin (Sigma) for 30 min or 0.1% Nonidet P-40 for 30 min. For transmission electron microscopy, cells were fixed for 2 h with 4% glutaraldehyde in sodium cacodylate buffer, post-fixed for 1 h with 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in Epon (EMS). Thin sections adsorbed onto nickel grids were stained with 1% uranyl acetate and 0.3% lead citrate and imaged in a JEOL-1200 EX electron microscope at 80 kV. Mitochondria surfaces were assessed with the Image Tools 3.0 software. We have designed a specific human OPA1 siRNA that corresponds to a sequence situated downstream of the GTPase coding sequence and analyzed its effect in HeLa cells comparatively with a control scramble siRNA (Dharmacond Research). After transfection, cells were collected every day for 3 days and Western blots performed. The different forms of OPA1 (1Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Google Scholar, 21Delettre C. Griffoin J.M. Kaplan J. Dollfus H. Lorenz B. Faivre L. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. Hamel C.P. Hum. Genet. 2001; 109: 584-591Google Scholar) were slightly affected at 24 h, declined at 48 h, and were almost not detectable at 72 h (Fig. 1 a). In parallel, the mitochondrial morphology was monitored on cells stained with the Mitotracker® Red (Fig. 1 b). 24 h after transfection of the OPA1 siRNA, cells retained a filamentous mitochondrial network as control cells (Fig. 1 b, top left). At 48 h, when OPA1 levels started to decline, half of the cells showed a filamentous mitochondrial network and half showed a fragmented one (Fig. 1 b, bottom left). At 72 h, when OPA1 levels were barely detectable, the filamentous phenotype had virtually disappeared to the benefit of the fragmented phenotype (60%), and of an additional phenotype (35%) that we described in Fig. 4. Fragmentation of the mitochondrial network induced by the loss of OPA1 was further visualized by immunofluorescence experiments using HSP60 antibodies and confocal microscopy three-dimensional reconstructions (Fig. 1 c).Figure 4Loss of OPA1 triggers apoptosis. a, kinetic of appearance of the apoptotic phenotype in cells transfected with the scramble (−) or the OPA1 (+) siRNA stained with DAPI and Mitotracker® Red.

Lombes A. Frachon P. Rojo M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4343-4354Google Scholar), we checked the effect of OPA1 down-regulation on the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) using JC1 and TMRE dyes. 72 h after OPA1 siRNA transfection, fluorescence microscopy observations revealed that the fragmented cells were all devoid of the JC1 ΔΨm-sensitive red fluorescence (Fig.2 a), as cells treated with the uncoupling drug DNP, and in deep contrast to cells treated with oligomycine, that increases the ΔΨm and consequently the amount of red fluorescence. FACS analyses performed with TMRE dye revealed that the ΔΨm in cells treated with the OPA1 siRNA was decreased to a level similar to that estimated for cells treated with the DNP drug and slightly higher than that observed for cells treated with the Nonidet P-40 detergent (Fig. 2 b). To gain insight on the possible function of OPA1 on the mitochondrial IM, we performed transmission electron microscopic observations on cells transfected or not by the OPA1 siRNA and grown for 72 h. Classical long tubular cylinders (mean mitochondrial surface area: 0.66 ± 0.49 μm2,n = 69) were observed in control cells (Fig.3 a), while circular vesicles of reduced diameter (0.115 ± 0.059 μm2,n = 194) predominated in treated cells (Fig. 3,b and c), confirming the photonic observations. Mitochondria from cells devoid of OPA1 further presented electron denser matrix and cristae completely unstructured, adopting unusual shapes consisting of vesicle-like structures with abnormal increased space between the membranes (Fig. 3, b, c, andb′), providing evidence suggesting that OPA1 has a major function in structuring the cristae membranes. Our electron microscopy pictures are consistent with descriptions of mitochondrial pyknosis (24Desagher S. Martinou J.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 369-377Google Scholar) and of the switch from wild-type to apoptotic mitochondria in liver cells (18Scorrano L. Ashiya M. Buttle K. Weiler S. Oakes S.A. Mannella C.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 55-67Google Scholar). In addition, our previous photonic observations, revealed 72 h after transfection of the OPA1 siRNA a high proportion (35%) of cells, with aggregated mitochondria, condensed chromatin, and fractionated nucleus reminiscent to apoptotic phenotype (Fig.4 a). To assert apoptosis, we estimated the amounts of the cleaved PARP protein (25Sallmann F.R. Bourassa S. Saint-Cyr J. Poirier G.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 75: 451-456Google Scholar) by Western blot (Fig. 4 a) and found that they correlated with the percentage of apoptotic cells. PARP cleavage did not occur in the presence of the caspases inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, but well in cells treated with CDDP (Fig.4 a). Cytochrome c release was further monitored by immunofluorescence using cyt c antibodies 72 h after the OPA1 siRNA transfection. Barely half of the cell population had released cyt c in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4 b), while no cyt c release or apoptotic figure was observed in control cells. To address the issue whether the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein could counteract the OPA1 induced apoptotic process, the OPA1 and scramble siRNA were transfected in an ovarian adenocarcinoma cell line (NIH-OVCAR-3) expressing constitutively or not Bcl2 (19Lafon C. Mathieu C. Guerrin M. Pierre O. Vidal S. Valette A. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1095-1104Google Scholar) (Fig.5 d). Loss of OPA1 (Fig.5 d) triggered fragmentation of the mitochondrial network in both cell lines (Fig. 5, a and b), while no morphological change was found using the scramble siRNA. In addition, 72 h after transfection, apoptosis (Fig. 5 c) reached 27% in the OVCAR cells, but was reduced by a 3-fold ratio in cells overexpressing Bcl2 (Fig. 5 d). Thus, in a second transformed cell line, loss of OPA1 triggers fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and an apoptotic process that can be inhibited by Bcl2 overexpression. Results presented here have shown that loss of OPA1 induces structural and functional modifications of the mitochondria. Indeed, down-regulation of OPA1 expression changes the mitochondrial network fusion-fission balance toward fission, as already noticed for its orthologs Mgm1p (13Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Google Scholar) and Msp1 2E. Guillou, unpublished data. in yeast. Thus OPA1 could either contributes as a fusion effector or as a fission inhibitor. Alternatively, the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network could be the consequence of the dissipation of the IM potential induced by loss of OPA1. In this respect, we further observed that the cristae were completely disorganized in the absence of OPA1. This later phenomenon could be the central process that would first dissipate the IM potential, then open the cristae junctions, allowing mobilization of cyt c and its release in the cytoplasm to trigger caspase-dependent apoptosis. How in this situation the cytc crosses the OM remains unclear, but this process and the downstream apoptotic events are inhibited by the overexpression of Bcl2. These data converge to propose that OPA1 participates in structuring the cristae to maintain their functional integrity. Therefore, OPA1 might be a key protein that modulates the IM dynamic to either maintain cell homeostasis or commit them to apoptosis and, consequently, could be a target for pro- or anti-apoptotic effectors. Thus coordinate structural changes of both mitochondrial membranes during apoptosis could be performed by both families of mitochondrial dynamin, as Drp1 was recently shown to be involved in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network during apoptosis (26Frank S. Gaume B. Bergmann-Leitner E.S. Leitner W.W. Robert E.G. Catez F. Smith C.L. Youle R.J. Dev. Cell. 2001; 1: 515-525Google Scholar). Finally, the link between OPA1 and apoptosis gives clues on the possible pathophysiological effect of mutations in the OPA1gene found in ADOA patients that leads to the neurodegeneration of the retinal ganglion cells (5Kjer P. Jensen O.A. Klinken L. Acta Ophthalmol. (Copenh.). 1983; 61: 300-312Google Scholar). Indeed, this cell population undergoes two rounds of apoptotic process during normal life: one during development when setting up the retina, which eliminates 70% of them, and one during every day life, which accounts for a loss of few thousands of them per year (27Farkas R.H. Grosskreutz C.L. Ophthalmol. Clin. North Am. 2002; 15: 61-68Google Scholar). Haplo-insufficiency generated by the dysfunction of one OPA1 allele (4Thiselton D.L. Alexander C. Taanman J.W. Brooks S. Rosenberg T. Eiberg H. Andreasson S. Van Regemorter N. Munier F.L. Moore A.T. Bhattacharya S.S. Votruba M. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1715-1724Google Scholar) might increase their susceptibility to apoptogen stimuli and in particular the one generated by the daily exposure to the UV light. We are indebted to the IFR109 technical resources and Brice Roncin for help in electron and confocal microscopy and members of the UMR5088 for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2118149443,"Before fertilization can occur, mammalian sperm must undergo capacitation, a process that requires a cyclic AMP-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. To identify proteins phosphorylated during capacitation, two-dimensional gel analysis coupled to anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) was performed. Among the protein targets, valosin-containing protein (VCP), a homolog of the SNARE-interacting protein NSF, and two members of the A kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP) family were found to be tyrosine phosphorylated during capacitation. In addition, immobilized metal affinity chromatography was used to investigate phosphorylation sites in whole protein digests from capacitated human sperm. To increase this chromatographic selectivity for phosphopeptides, acidic residues in peptide digests were converted to their respective methyl esters before affinity chromatography. More than 60 phosphorylated sequences were then mapped by MS/MS, including precise sites of tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of the sperm tail proteins AKAP-3 and AKAP-4. Moreover, differential isotopic labeling was developed to quantify phosphorylation changes occurring during capacitation. The phosphopeptide enrichment and quantification methodology coupled to MS/MS, described here for the first time, can be employed to map and compare phosphorylation sites involved in multiple cellular processes. Although we were unable to determine the exact site of phosphorylation of VCP, we did confirm, using a cross-immunoprecipitation approach, that this protein is tyrosine phosphorylated during capacitation. Immunolocalization of VCP showed fluorescent staining in the neck of noncapacitated sperm. However, after capacitation, staining in the neck decreased, and most of the sperm showed fluorescent staining in the anterior head.

They acquire the ability to fertilize in the female genital tract in a time-dependent process called capacitation (1Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1-6Google Scholar). Capacitation is accompanied by a cAMP-protein kinase-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins (2Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Google Scholar, 3Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Google Scholar). Because a protein kinase cascade is involved in the regulation of the sperm fertilizing ability, it is important to characterize the proteins that undergo phosphorylation and examine how these changes relate to capacitation.Post-translational protein phosphorylation by protein kinases plays a role in many cellular processes including transduction of extracellular signals, intracellular transport, and cell cycle progression. The use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)1provides a comprehensive approach to the analysis of proteins involved in cell signaling (4Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1429-1440Google Scholar). Specifically, changes in tyrosine phosphorylation can be monitored using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-PY) antibodies (5Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 771-787Google Scholar). Proteins that undergo changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during cellular processes can be then isolated from a complementary gel and sequenced by MS/MS. In the present study, we have used this approach to identify several sperm proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation.Identification of the site at which a particular protein is phosphorylated is important in identifying the physiologically relevant protein kinase involved in a particular pathway. In addition, to understand the function of a phosphoprotein, phosphorylation sites are excellent candidates for site-directed mutagenesis. Determination of individual phosphorylation sites in vivo often requires the purification to homogeneity and/or mutation analysis of the phosphoprotein. Recently, several methods for the selective detection and enrichment of phosphopeptides have been developed (6Cao P. Stults J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 853: 225-235Google Scholar, 7Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Google Scholar, 8Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 393-404Google Scholar); however, most of them have been applied only on a protein-by-protein basis. In the present work, we have used Fe3+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) prior to MS/MS to enrich digests for peptides containing phosphoamino acids. To increase the selectivity of the IMAC column for phosphopeptides, we have used a recently developed modification of this technique in which acidic residues are converted to methyl esters to block their binding to iron before IMAC is employed (9Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-306Google Scholar). Using this methodology, 5 sites of Tyr, 56 of Ser, and 2 of Thr phosphorylation have been characterized.Although the combination of IMAC and MS/MS is ideally suited for the characterization of phosphorylation sites on proteins in complex mixtures, it is also important to determine which sites are phosphorylated in response to a particular stimulus. In the present paper, we have used differential isotopic labeling to quantify phosphorylation of defined sequences and to determine which sites suffer increased or decreased phosphorylation during human sperm capacitation. The evaluation of differential phosphorylation, added to the knowledge of the exact phosphorylated sequence, goes beyond the sperm capacitation field and could be used to understand signaling mechanisms in a multiplicity of cell systems.Identification of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of AKAP-3 and AKAP-4 confirmed the previous findings using a two-dimensional gel approach, suggesting that these proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated in a capacitated sperm population. Nevertheless, because of the relative abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphopeptides compared with phosphoserine phosphopeptides, most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites remained unknown. Among them, sites in the NSF homolog VCP remained unidentified. Because VCP is associated with a role in membrane fusion in other cell types and because several aspects of sperm physiology required membrane fusion events, VCP was chosen for further investigation. Anti-VCP antibodies confirmed that this protein is tyrosine phosphorylated during capacitation. In addition, immunolocalization of VCP was determined and showed different localization patterns before and after human sperm capacitation.DISCUSSIONThe physiological changes that render mammalian sperm able to fertilize are collectively known as capacitation. Capacitation has been correlated with the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (1Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1-6Google Scholar). With the exception of two members of the AKAP family (13Mandal A. Naaby-Hansen S. Wolkowicz M.J. Klotz K. Shetty J. Retief J.D. Coonrod S.A. Kinter M. Sherman N. Cesar F. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1184-1197Google Scholar,27Carrera A. Moos J. Ning X.P. Gerton G.L. Tesarik J. Kopf G.S. Moss S.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 284-296Google Scholar) and CABYR (28Naaby-Hansen S. Mandal A. Wolkowicz M.J. Sen B. Westbrook V.A. Shetty J. Coonrod S.A. Klotz K.L. Kim Y.-H. Bush L.A. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Dev. Biol. 2002; 242: 236-254Google Scholar), proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation have not yet been characterized. Capacitation prepares the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction and also is associated with changes in sperm motility (e.g.hyperactivation) in a number of species (1Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1-6Google Scholar). Therefore, one may postulate that components of the sperm exocytotic and motility machinery are modified during capacitation (e.g.phosphorylation of specific proteins, changes in protein localization, and/or modification of protein-protein interactions). In the present work, we have analyzed the phosphoproteome of capacitated human sperm using 1) two-dimensional gels followed by α-PY Western blot and 2) direct MS/MS sequencing of phosphopeptides in total protein extracts.To understand the link between capacitation and the acrosome reaction, an increased knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate this exocytotic event in sperm is necessary. Sperm homologs of SNARE (29Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar) as well as SNARE-associated proteins have been detected in sea urchin (30Schulz J.R. Sasaki J.D. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24355-24359Google Scholar) and mammalian sperm (31Michaut M. Tomes C.N. De Blas G. Yunes R. Mayorga L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9996-10001Google Scholar, 32Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Sutovsky P. Chan A.W. Hewitson L. Wessel G.M. Simerly C.R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 54-69Google Scholar). These observations support the idea that the sperm acrosome reaction might be regulated in ways similar to the exocytotic processes in somatic cells. Among the proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation, we identified VCP/p97 in this study. VCP/p97, a member of the AAA family (ATPasesAssociated with various cellular Activities) (33Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Google Scholar), along with NSF and the Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5, mediate the fusion of Golgi membranes (21Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Google Scholar, 34Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar). Although VCP/p97 and NSF are highly homologous, they appear to act in distinct fusion events, presumably because of additional specific cofactors (35Urbe S. Page L.J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1831-1844Google Scholar). VCP/p97 has a role as a chaperone and aids in the assembly, disassembly, and functional operation of protein complexes. VCP/p97 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation, and although this phosphorylation did not alter its ATPase activity (23Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the subcellular localization of this protein (25Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Google Scholar). Moreover, a membrane fusion process such as the transitional endoplasmic reticulum assembly in vitro requires tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP/p97 (36Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K. Fazel A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that VCP/p97 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. In addition, we have shown that prior to capacitation VCP/p97 localizes in the neck of human sperm, whereas after overnight incubation, immunofluorescence experiments showed a decreased staining in the neck and the appearance of this protein in the anterior head of capacitated sperm. At least three hypotheses can be made to explain these different immunofluorescent patterns. First, modifications of the sperm during capacitation allowed α-VCP antibodies to enter the anterior head of the sperm. Although possible, experiments showing that SP-10 can be recognized before and after capacitation added to the observation of a decrease in fluorescent staining in the neck of capacitated sperm argue against this explanation. Second, the epitopes recognized by two α-VCP antibodies are unmasked in the anterior head, but they are masked in the neck of capacitated sperm. Third, there is a translocation of VCP during capacitation from the neck to the anterior head of human sperm. Ideally this hypothesis should be tested by a direct measurement of VCP in the neck and the anterior head after separation of these subcellular compartments; however, the impossibility of separating the neck from the anterior head prevented us from performing this experiment. Considering the role of VCP/p97 and other members of the AAA family of phosphatases in fusion processes, these results suggest that VCP/p97 and tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could have a role as a link between capacitation and the acrosome reaction. Alternatively, this protein can act as a chaperone, bringing relevant membrane fusion proteins to the site of the acrosome reaction.Capacitation is also linked to events that occur in the sperm flagellum. AKAPs represent a growing family of scaffolding proteins that function to tether the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A and other enzymes to organelles or cytoskeletal elements. These proteins permit the precise control of signal transduction in discrete regions of the cell (37Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). In the present work, we have confirmed tyrosine phosphorylation of AKAP-3 and AKAP-4 during human sperm capacitation and mapped eight phosphorylation sites of these proteins. Among these sites, the AKAP-4 phosphopeptide INApSTDpSLAK was found to be 23 times more abundant in capacitated sperm, suggesting that this phosphorylation site might be involved in the regulation of AKAP-4 function during capacitation.Multiple methodologies have been used to study phosphorylation. Recently, mass spectrometry has become the preferred method to identify phosphopeptides because of its speed and high sensitivity. Nevertheless, because phosphorylation sites are usually substoichiometric, it has been necessary to devise new methods for selective detection and enrichment of phosphopeptides. Recently, although several methods have been developed, most have been applied only on a protein-by-protein basis (8Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 393-404Google Scholar) with a few notable exceptions (38Oda Y. Nagasu T. Chait B.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 379-382Google Scholar, 39Zhou H. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 375-378Google Scholar). None of these methods has been used successfully to identify phosphotyrosine residues from complex mixtures probably because of multiple steps of derivatization that reduced the final recovery. On the other hand, IMAC has been used previously to enrich digests for phosphorylated peptides (6Cao P. Stults J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 853: 225-235Google Scholar, 16Zarling A.L. Ficarro S.B. White F.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1755-1762Google Scholar); however, the selectivity of this technique is poor because peptides containing acidic residues (i.e. Glu and Asp) bind to the immobilized iron atoms (40Muszynska G. Dobrowolska G. Medin A. Ekman P. Porath J.O. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 604: 19-28Google Scholar). To solve this lack of specificity, acidic residues were converted to methyl esters, eliminating the binding of nonphosphorylated species to the IMAC column. This procedure does not generate diasteromers and is compatible with phosphorylated Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. This methodology was used successfully to map 60 sites of phosphorylation.The sites of phosphorylation identified here defined in vivosites of phosphorylation resulting from normal phosphorylation events in capacitated human sperm and were not obtained by kinase overexpression or by kinase activators or phosphatase inhibitors. Although most of the sites described in the present work have not been observed previously, phosphorylation of the C-terminal protein kinase A catalytic subunit peptide IRVpSINE has been demonstrated to be necessary for the catalytic activity of recombinant protein kinase A (41Yonemoto W. Garrod S.M. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18626-18632Google Scholar). Another observation derived from the capacitated human sperm phosphoproteome is that four of the five tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences contained phosphoserine in the proximity of the phosphotyrosine. This result raises the possibility that a dual specificity kinase is involved in the capacitation process and/or that phosphoserine is part of the substrate recognition motif for a sperm tyrosine kinase. Because the identity of tyrosine kinases present in sperm is at present not known, peptide sequences found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated can be used as substrates to purify tyrosine kinases from sperm.After enrichment of phosphorylated peptides, the next step is to derive their sequences and define the sites of phosphorylation. In many cases, identification of the exact phosphorylation sequence was precluded because of the complexity of the phosphopeptide MS/MS spectra. To simplify interpretation of phosphopeptide spectra, we performed on-line AP dephosphorylation after IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment. AP treatment has been shown to enhance detection of multiply phosphorylated peptides (42Xhou W. Merrick B.A. Khaledi M.G. Tomer K.B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 273-282Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphopeptides followed by AP treatment and reanalysis has been demonstrated as a technique for phosphopeptide identification based on 80-Da differences (43Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Google Scholar). This method allowed identification of one additional peptide that was not detected without AP treatment.In summary, 16 proteins that are recognized by α-PY antibodies in two-dimensional Western blots were determined. From these proteins, VCP/p97 was also detected in α-PY immunoprecipitates and showed different immunolocalization patterns before and after capacitation. In addition, we have successfully employed IMAC enrichment of phosphopeptides coupled to MS/MS analysis to isolate and sequence phosphopeptides from total protein digests of human capacitated sperm. This is the first study in which this methodology has been used to map phosphopeptides in a human cell type. Moreover, we have coupled this methodology with differential isotopic labeling and IMAC enrichment to derive quantitative information on phosphorylation events that occur during capacitation. This technique goes beyond the field of reproductive biology and could potentially be used to map and compare sites of phosphorylation in a variety of biological systems. After ejaculation, sperm are able to move actively but lack fertilizing competence. They acquire the ability to fertilize in the female genital tract in a time-dependent process called capacitation (1Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1-6Google Scholar). Capacitation is accompanied by a cAMP-protein kinase-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a subset of proteins (2Visconti P.E. Bailey J.L. Moore G.D. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1129-1137Google Scholar, 3Visconti P.E. Moore G.D. Bailey J.L. Leclerc P. Connors S.A. Pan D. Olds-Clarke P. Kopf G.S. Development. 1995; 121: 1139-1150Google Scholar). Because a protein kinase cascade is involved in the regulation of the sperm fertilizing ability, it is important to characterize the proteins that undergo phosphorylation and examine how these changes relate to capacitation. Post-translational protein phosphorylation by protein kinases plays a role in many cellular processes including transduction of extracellular signals, intracellular transport, and cell cycle progression. The use of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)1provides a comprehensive approach to the analysis of proteins involved in cell signaling (4Blomberg A. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1429-1440Google Scholar). Specifically, changes in tyrosine phosphorylation can be monitored using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine (α-PY) antibodies (5Naaby-Hansen S. Flickinger C.J. Herr J.C. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 56: 771-787Google Scholar). Proteins that undergo changes in tyrosine phosphorylation during cellular processes can be then isolated from a complementary gel and sequenced by MS/MS. In the present study, we have used this approach to identify several sperm proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. Identification of the site at which a particular protein is phosphorylated is important in identifying the physiologically relevant protein kinase involved in a particular pathway. In addition, to understand the function of a phosphoprotein, phosphorylation sites are excellent candidates for site-directed mutagenesis. Determination of individual phosphorylation sites in vivo often requires the purification to homogeneity and/or mutation analysis of the phosphoprotein. Recently, several methods for the selective detection and enrichment of phosphopeptides have been developed (6Cao P. Stults J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 853: 225-235Google Scholar, 7Posewitz M.C. Tempst P. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2883-2892Google Scholar, 8Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 393-404Google Scholar); however, most of them have been applied only on a protein-by-protein basis. In the present work, we have used Fe3+-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) prior to MS/MS to enrich digests for peptides containing phosphoamino acids. To increase the selectivity of the IMAC column for phosphopeptides, we have used a recently developed modification of this technique in which acidic residues are converted to methyl esters to block their binding to iron before IMAC is employed (9Ficarro S.B. McCleland M.L. Stukenberg P.T. Burke D.J. Ross M.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. White F.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 301-306Google Scholar). Using this methodology, 5 sites of Tyr, 56 of Ser, and 2 of Thr phosphorylation have been characterized. Although the combination of IMAC and MS/MS is ideally suited for the characterization of phosphorylation sites on proteins in complex mixtures, it is also important to determine which sites are phosphorylated in response to a particular stimulus. In the present paper, we have used differential isotopic labeling to quantify phosphorylation of defined sequences and to determine which sites suffer increased or decreased phosphorylation during human sperm capacitation. The evaluation of differential phosphorylation, added to the knowledge of the exact phosphorylated sequence, goes beyond the sperm capacitation field and could be used to understand signaling mechanisms in a multiplicity of cell systems. Identification of the tyrosine phosphorylation sites of AKAP-3 and AKAP-4 confirmed the previous findings using a two-dimensional gel approach, suggesting that these proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated in a capacitated sperm population. Nevertheless, because of the relative abundance of tyrosine-phosphorylated phosphopeptides compared with phosphoserine phosphopeptides, most of the tyrosine-phosphorylated sites remained unknown. Among them, sites in the NSF homolog VCP remained unidentified. Because VCP is associated with a role in membrane fusion in other cell types and because several aspects of sperm physiology required membrane fusion events, VCP was chosen for further investigation. Anti-VCP antibodies confirmed that this protein is tyrosine phosphorylated during capacitation. In addition, immunolocalization of VCP was determined and showed different localization patterns before and after human sperm capacitation.

Biol. 2002; 242: 236-254Google Scholar), proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation have not yet been characterized. Capacitation prepares the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction and also is associated with changes in sperm motility (e.g.hyperactivation) in a number of species (1Visconti P.E. Kopf G.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1-6Google Scholar). Therefore, one may postulate that components of the sperm exocytotic and motility machinery are modified during capacitation (e.g.phosphorylation of specific proteins, changes in protein localization, and/or modification of protein-protein interactions). In the present work, we have analyzed the phosphoproteome of capacitated human sperm using 1) two-dimensional gels followed by α-PY Western blot and 2) direct MS/MS sequencing of phosphopeptides in total protein extracts. To understand the link between capacitation and the acrosome reaction, an increased knowledge of the mechanisms that regulate this exocytotic event in sperm is necessary. Sperm homologs of SNARE (29Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar) as well as SNARE-associated proteins have been detected in sea urchin (30Schulz J.R. Sasaki J.D. Vacquier V.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24355-24359Google Scholar) and mammalian sperm (31Michaut M. Tomes C.N. De Blas G. Yunes R. Mayorga L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9996-10001Google Scholar, 32Ramalho-Santos J. Moreno R.D. Sutovsky P. Chan A.W. Hewitson L. Wessel G.M. Simerly C.R. Schatten G. Dev. Biol. 2000; 223: 54-69Google Scholar). These observations support the idea that the sperm acrosome reaction might be regulated in ways similar to the exocytotic processes in somatic cells. Among the proteins that undergo tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation, we identified VCP/p97 in this study. VCP/p97, a member of the AAA family (ATPasesAssociated with various cellular Activities) (33Zhang X. Shaw A. Bates P.A. Newman R.H. Gowen B. Orlova E. Gorman M.A. Kondo H. Dokurno P. Lally J. Leonard G. Meyer H. van Heel M. Freemont P.S. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1473-1484Google Scholar), along with NSF and the Golgi t-SNARE syntaxin 5, mediate the fusion of Golgi membranes (21Kondo H. Rabouille C. Newman R. Levine T.P. Pappin D. Freemont P. Warren G. Nature. 1997; 388: 75-78Google Scholar, 34Rabouille C. Levine T.P. Peters J.M. Warren G. Cell. 1995; 82: 905-914Google Scholar). Although VCP/p97 and NSF are highly homologous, they appear to act in distinct fusion events, presumably because of additional specific cofactors (35Urbe S. Page L.J. Tooze S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1831-1844Google Scholar). VCP/p97 has a role as a chaperone and aids in the assembly, disassembly, and functional operation of protein complexes. VCP/p97 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during T cell activation, and although this phosphorylation did not alter its ATPase activity (23Egerton M. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11435-11441Google Scholar), tyrosine phosphorylation regulates the subcellular localization of this protein (25Madeo F. Schlauer J. Zischka H. Mecke D. Frohlich K.U. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 131-141Google Scholar). Moreover, a membrane fusion process such as the transitional endoplasmic reticulum assembly in vitro requires tyrosine phosphorylation of VCP/p97 (36Lavoie C. Chevet E. Roy L. Tonks N.K. Fazel A. Posner B.I. Paiement J. Bergeron J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13637-13642Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that VCP/p97 undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation during capacitation. In addition, we have shown that prior to capacitation VCP/p97 localizes in the neck of human sperm, whereas after overnight incubation, immunofluorescence experiments showed a decreased staining in the neck and the appearance of this protein in the anterior head of capacitated sperm. At least three hypotheses can be made to explain these different immunofluorescent patterns. First, modifications of the sperm during capacitation allowed α-VCP antibodies to enter the anterior head of the sperm. Although possible, experiments showing that SP-10 can be recognized before and after capacitation added to the observation of a decrease in fluorescent staining in the neck of capacitated sperm argue against this explanation. Second, the epitopes recognized by two α-VCP antibodies are unmasked in the anterior head, but they are masked in the neck of capacitated sperm. Third, there is a translocation of VCP during capacitation from the neck to the anterior head of human sperm. Ideally this hypothesis should be tested by a direct measurement of VCP in the neck and the anterior head after separation of these subcellular compartments; however, the impossibility of separating the neck from the anterior head prevented us from performing this experiment. Considering the role of VCP/p97 and other members of the AAA family of phosphatases in fusion processes, these results suggest that VCP/p97 and tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein could have a role as a link between capacitation and the acrosome reaction. Alternatively, this protein can act as a chaperone, bringing relevant membrane fusion proteins to the site of the acrosome reaction. Capacitation is also linked to events that occur in the sperm flagellum. AKAPs represent a growing family of scaffolding proteins that function to tether the regulatory subunits of protein kinase A and other enzymes to organelles or cytoskeletal elements. These proteins permit the precise control of signal transduction in discrete regions of the cell (37Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar). In the present work, we have confirmed tyrosine phosphorylation of AKAP-3 and AKAP-4 during human sperm capacitation and mapped eight phosphorylation sites of these proteins. Among these sites, the AKAP-4 phosphopeptide INApSTDpSLAK was found to be 23 times more abundant in capacitated sperm, suggesting that this phosphorylation site might be involved in the regulation of AKAP-4 function during capacitation. Multiple methodologies have been used to study phosphorylation. Recently, mass spectrometry has become the preferred method to identify phosphopeptides because of its speed and high sensitivity. Nevertheless, because phosphorylation sites are usually substoichiometric, it has been necessary to devise new methods for selective detection and enrichment of phosphopeptides. Recently, although several methods have been developed, most have been applied only on a protein-by-protein basis (8Annan R.S. Huddleston M.J. Verma R. Deshaies R.J. Carr S.A. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 393-404Google Scholar) with a few notable exceptions (38Oda Y. Nagasu T. Chait B.T. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 379-382Google Scholar, 39Zhou H. Watts J.D. Aebersold R. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 375-378Google Scholar). None of these methods has been used successfully to identify phosphotyrosine residues from complex mixtures probably because of multiple steps of derivatization that reduced the final recovery. On the other hand, IMAC has been used previously to enrich digests for phosphorylated peptides (6Cao P. Stults J.T. J. Chromatogr. 1999; 853: 225-235Google Scholar, 16Zarling A.L. Ficarro S.B. White F.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Engelhard V.H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1755-1762Google Scholar); however, the selectivity of this technique is poor because peptides containing acidic residues (i.e. Glu and Asp) bind to the immobilized iron atoms (40Muszynska G. Dobrowolska G. Medin A. Ekman P. Porath J.O. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 604: 19-28Google Scholar). To solve this lack of specificity, acidic residues were converted to methyl esters, eliminating the binding of nonphosphorylated species to the IMAC column. This procedure does not generate diasteromers and is compatible with phosphorylated Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. This methodology was used successfully to map 60 sites of phosphorylation. The sites of phosphorylation identified here defined in vivosites of phosphorylation resulting from normal phosphorylation events in capacitated human sperm and were not obtained by kinase overexpression or by kinase activators or phosphatase inhibitors. Although most of the sites described in the present work have not been observed previously, phosphorylation of the C-terminal protein kinase A catalytic subunit peptide IRVpSINE has been demonstrated to be necessary for the catalytic activity of recombinant protein kinase A (41Yonemoto W. Garrod S.M. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18626-18632Google Scholar). Another observation derived from the capacitated human sperm phosphoproteome is that four of the five tyrosine-phosphorylated sequences contained phosphoserine in the proximity of the phosphotyrosine. This result raises the possibility that a dual specificity kinase is involved in the capacitation process and/or that phosphoserine is part of the substrate recognition motif for a sperm tyrosine kinase. Because the identity of tyrosine kinases present in sperm is at present not known, peptide sequences found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated can be used as substrates to purify tyrosine kinases from sperm. After enrichment of phosphorylated peptides, the next step is to derive their sequences and define the sites of phosphorylation. In many cases, identification of the exact phosphorylation sequence was precluded because of the complexity of the phosphopeptide MS/MS spectra. To simplify interpretation of phosphopeptide spectra, we performed on-line AP dephosphorylation after IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment. AP treatment has been shown to enhance detection of multiply phosphorylated peptides (42Xhou W. Merrick B.A. Khaledi M.G. Tomer K.B. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 273-282Google Scholar). Analysis of phosphopeptides followed by AP treatment and reanalysis has been demonstrated as a technique for phosphopeptide identification based on 80-Da differences (43Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Google Scholar). This method allowed identification of one additional peptide that was not detected without AP treatment. In summary, 16 proteins that are recognized by α-PY antibodies in two-dimensional Western blots were determined. From these proteins, VCP/p97 was also detected in α-PY immunoprecipitates and showed different immunolocalization patterns before and after capacitation. In addition, we have successfully employed IMAC enrichment of phosphopeptides coupled to MS/MS analysis to isolate and sequence phosphopeptides from total protein digests of human capacitated sperm. This is the first study in which this methodology has been used to map phosphopeptides in a human cell type. Moreover, we have coupled this methodology with differential isotopic labeling and IMAC enrichment to derive quantitative information on phosphorylation events that occur during capacitation. This technique goes beyond the field of reproductive biology and could potentially be used to map and compare sites of phosphorylation in a variety of biological systems.

In addition, we are also grateful to Dr. Mandal and Dr. Reddi (Department of Cell Biology, University of Virginia) for providing α-AKAP-3 and α-SP-10 antibodies.

A variety of stimuli regulate eNOS activity through signaling pathways involving Akt kinase and/or mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. In the present study, we investigated the role of kinase cascades in HDL-induced eNOS stimulation in cultured endothelial cells and COS M6 cells transfected with eNOS and the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor B-I. HDL (10–50 μg/ml, 20 min) caused eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179, and dominant negative Akt inhibited both HDL-mediated phosphorylation and activation of the enzyme. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3 kinase) inhibition or dominant negative PI3 kinase also blocked the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS by HDL. Studies with genistein and PP2 showed that the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase, Src, is an upstream stimulator of the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway in this paradigm. In addition, HDL activated MAP kinase through PI3 kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibition fully attenuated eNOS stimulation by HDL without affecting Akt or eNOS Ser-1179 phosphorylation. Conversely, dominant negative Akt did not alter HDL-induced MAP kinase activation. These results indicate that HDL stimulates eNOS through common upstream, Src-mediated signaling, which leads to parallel activation of Akt and MAP kinases and their resultant independent modulation of the enzyme.

HDL classically serves to remove cholesterol from peripheral tissues in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport. However, the mechanisms by which HDL is atheroprotective are complex and not fully understood, since circulating levels of HDL and the major HDL apolipoprotein, apolipoprotein A-I, do not regulate reverse cholesterol transport (3Jolley C.D. Woollett L.A. Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2143-2149Google Scholar). We previously reported that HDL stimulates endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) activity in endothelial cells (EC) through apolipoprotein A-I binding to scavenger receptor type I (SR-BI), the high affinity HDL receptor (4Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Google Scholar). Similarly, HDL enhances endothelium- and NO-dependent relaxation in aortas from wild-type but not SR-BI knock-out mice. Recently, Li et al. (5Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11058-11063Google Scholar) also reported that HDL binding to SR-BI activates eNOS. The HDL-induced increase in NO production may be critical to the atheroprotective features of HDL, since diminished bioavailablity of endothelium-derived NO has a key role in the early pathogenesis of hypercholesterolemia-induced vascular disease and atherosclerosis (6Cohen R.A. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1995; 38: 105-128Google Scholar, 7Naruse K. Shimizu K. Muramatsu M. Toki Y. Miyazaki Y. Okumura K. Hashimoto H. Ito T. Arterioscler.

However, the mechanisms by which HDL activates eNOS are yet to be clarified. eNOS is one of three isoenzymes that convert l-arginine tol-citrulline plus NO. The activity of eNOS is regulated by complex signal transduction pathways that involve various phosphorylation events and protein-protein interactions. Many stimuli modulate eNOS activity by activating kinases that alter the phosphorylation of the enzyme (9Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ.

To better understand the basis of HDL action in endothelium, the present investigation was designed to test the hypothesis that HDL activation of eNOS entails the phosphorylation of the enzyme. We also studied the potential roles of specific kinase cascades in HDL-mediated eNOS stimulation. Using pharmacological inhibition or dominant negative mutant forms of selective kinases in EC or COS M6 cells transfected with eNOS and the HDL receptor, SR-BI, we investigated the involvement of tyrosine kinases, PI3 kinase, Akt, and MAP kinases in HDL-mediated eNOS activation. In addition to improving our specific understanding of eNOS modulation, the elucidation of the signaling cascade(s) coupling SR-BI to the enzyme provides important clues about multiple additional potential target of HDL action in EC. Primary ovine endothelial cells were propagated and maintained as described previously (28Pace M.C. Chambliss K.L. German Z. Yuhanna I.S. Mendelsohn M.E. Shaul P.W. Am. J.

For confirmation purposes, selected experiments were also done in human aortic endothelial cells (purchased from BioWhittaker), propagated in EGM-2 and used at passages 4–6, and in bovine aortic endothelial cells, maintained in EGM-2 medium and studied at passages 5–8. COS M6 cells, which express a negligible amount of endogenous SR-BI and no eNOS, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). COS M6 cells were transfected with various cDNAs using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The transfected cells were used 48 h after transfection, and 70–80% transfection efficiency was typically achieved. cDNAs for wild-type eNOS, S1179A eNOS, AktAAA, AktMyr, and SrαΔ85 were prepared as described previously (20Montagnani M.

The triple Akt mutant AktAAA (K179A,T308A,S403A) is enzymatically inactive (29Morales-Ruiz M. Lee M.J. Zollner S. Gratton J.P. Scotland R. Shiojima I. Walsh K. Hla T. Sessa W.C. J. Biol.

In selected experiments, the cells were preincubated with kinase inhibitors (genistein, PP2, wortmaninn, LY294002, or PD98059) (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 37 °C. After the addition of HDL (10–50 μg/ml) or vascular endothelial growth factor (100 ng/ml) (Calbiochem) and [3H]l-arginine, the cells were further incubated for the indicated times. All findings were confirmed in at least three independent studies. Comparison between two groups was accomplished using Student's t test, and comparison between more than two groups employed Student's t tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Significance was accepted at the 0.05 level of probability. In order to determine whether HDL stimulation of eNOS requires the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179, primary ECs were incubated with HDL (10 or 50 μg/ml) for 20 min or with VEGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, serving as a positive control. The phosphorylation was detected by Western blotting using anti-phospho-specific eNOS antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 a, eNOS phosphorylation was observed with 10 or 50 μg/ml HDL treatment as well as with 100 ng/ml VEGF treatment. Phosphorylation of eNOS by HDL (30 μg/ml) was observed as early as 5 min and reached maximum at 10–20 min (data not shown). Comparable eNOS phosphorylation by HDL was seen in the ovine, human, and bovine EC (data not shown). We next determined whether the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 is required for the activation of eNOS by HDL. Either wild-type eNOS or S1179A mutant eNOS was expressed in COS M6 cells along with SR-BI, and the phosphorylation and activation of eNOS was assessed in response to HDL (10 or 30 μg/ml). No phosphorylation of eNOS by HDL was detected in S1179A-transfected cells, whereas wild-type eNOS phosphorylation was apparent (Fig. 1 b). In parallel, HDL did not stimulate eNOS activation in cells transfected with S1179A eNOS, whereas HDL stimulated eNOS activation in wild-type eNOS-expressing cells (Fig.1 c). The dephosphorylation of eNOS at Thr-497 is involved in the activation of eNOS by bradykinin and VEGF (9Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Google Scholar, 10Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Google Scholar, 11Garcia-Cardena G. Fan R. Stern D.F. Liu J. Sessa W.C. J.

We investigated the effect of HDL on the phosphorylation state of eNOS at Thr-497 using the phospho-specific antibody against the site. As shown in Fig.1 d, in contrast to the observed change in Ser-1179 phosphorylation, HDL had no notable effect on the phosphorylation state of Thr-497 of eNOS. Since certain stimuli such as estrogen and VEGF activate eNOS through Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the enzyme, we investigated the involvement of Akt in the phosphorylation and stimulation of eNOS by HDL. Akt is activated by PI3 kinase through recruitment to the plasma membrane, where Akt becomes phosphorylated at Ser-473 and Ser-308 (31Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.

ECs were incubated with HDL (10 or 50 μg/ml) for 20 min. The phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was detected with HDL (Fig.2 a), and it occurred as early as 5 min and reached a maximum at 30 min (Fig. 2 b). We also found that HDL (30 μg/ml, 20 min) caused the recruitment of Akt to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2 c), further indicating the activation of Akt by the lipoprotein. To determine whether Akt is responsible for the phosphorylation of eNOS by HDL, either sham plasmid, a dominant negative Akt mutant (AktAAA, designated DN), or a constitutively active Akt mutant (AktMyr, designated CA) was expressed in COS M6 cells along with wild type eNOS and SR-BI. The transfected cells were incubated with HDL (30 μg/ml) for 0–30 min, and the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 was assessed. As shown in Fig. 2 d, HDL caused phosphorylation of eNOS in cells expressing endogenous wild-type Akt (sham), but no eNOS phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing dominant negative Akt (DN). Constitutively active Akt caused phosphorylation of eNOS in the absence of HDL (CA, 0 min). These results suggest that HDL stimulates Akt, which in turn phosphorylates eNOS. Since PI3 kinase is a known upstream activator of Akt, we next examined the effect of PI3 kinase inhibitors on both Akt and eNOS phosphorylation and activation. Primary ECs were preincubated with the PI3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin (50 μm) for 20 min before HDL stimulation (30 μg/ml), and the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was assessed. In parallel experiments, eNOS activity was measured. Wortmannin inhibited both Akt phosphorylation (Fig.3 a) and eNOS activation (Fig.3 b). In order to examine the involvement of PI3 kinase in eNOS phosphorylation by HDL, the effect of another PI3 kinase inhibitor, LY294002, was assessed. ECs were preincubated with LYL294002 (50 μm) for 20 min before HDL (30 μg/ml) stimulation for 0–20 min. As shown in Fig. 3 c, LY294002 inhibited HDL-mediated eNOS phosphorylation. To further confirm the involvement of PI3 kinase in eNOS phosphorylation, sham vector or dominant negative PI3 kinase (SrΔ85) was transfected in COS M6 cells expressing eNOS and SR-BI, and the phosphorylation state of eNOS was assessed. As shown in Fig. 3 d, overexpression of dominant negative PI3 kinase inhibited eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179. These results suggest that HDL phosphorylates and stimulates eNOS through PI3 kinase-mediated Akt activation. Tyrosine kinases frequently serve as upstream stimulators of PI3 kinase. The involvement of nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Src family) has been demonstrated for eNOS stimulation by a variety of factors (21Davis M.E. Cai H. Drummond G.R. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1073-1080Google Scholar,22Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Google Scholar). We determined the effect of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, on eNOS activation and phosphorylation by HDL. Primary cultured endothelial cells were preincubated with or without Genistein (50 μm) for 20 min before the addition of HDL (30 μg/ml) for 0–20 min. Phosphorylation states and activation of eNOS were assessed. As shown in Fig. 4,a and b, Genistein abrogated both eNOS phosphorylation and activation. We next examined the involvement of the Src kinase family. Endothelial cells were incubated with or without the Src kinase-specific inhibitor, PP2 (0.1 μm), before HDL stimulation (10 μg/ml, 20 min). PP2 inhibited both eNOS activation and phosphorylation by HDL (Fig. 4, c and d). These results suggest that HDL stimulates tyrosine kinases that are most likely Src family kinases, which in turn activate the PI3 kinase-Akt pathway to ultimately lead to eNOS phosphorylation. The role of MAP kinases in HDL stimulation of eNOS is not known. As such, we studied the effect of HDL on MAP kinase activation in primary ECs. Cells were stimulated with HDL (10 or 50 μg/ml) for 20 min, using fetal calf serum (10%, 5 min) or VEGF (100 ng/ml, 5 min) as a positive control. The activation state of MAP kinase was assessed by phospho-MAP kinase-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 a, HDL stimulated MAP kinase phosphorylation. The phosphorylation was detected as early as 2 min and reached maximal phosphorylation at 30 min (Fig.5 b). The activation of MAP kinase by HDL was suppressed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Fig. 5 c). Both PI3 kinase inhibition (wortmannin (Wort)) (Fig. 5 d) and Src kinase inhibition (PP2) (Fig. 5 e) also attenuated MAP kinase activation by HDL, indicating that PI3 kinase and Src kinase are the upstream effectors of MAP kinase activation by HDL. To determine whether MAP kinase phosphorylation is required for eNOS activation by HDL, EC were pretreated with MEK inhibitor (PD98059), and eNOS activation was assessed. As shown in Fig. 5 f, PD98059 (50 μm) completely abrogated eNOS activation by HDL. Comparable MAP kinase activation by HDL was observed in the ovine, human, and bovine EC (data not shown). To determine whether MAP kinase activates eNOS through the phosphorylation of the enzyme at Ser-1179, we examined the effect of MEK inhibition on eNOS phosphorylation. As shown in Fig.6 a, PD98059 prevented MAP kinase phosphorylation, but it did not attenuate eNOS phosphorylation, suggesting that MAP kinase contributes to eNOS activation through a different mechanism. To further assess possible cross-talk between Akt and MAP kinase signaling pathways, we determined whether the MAP kinase cascade activates Akt. EC were treated with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, and the phosphorylation of Akt was assessed. As shown in Fig. 6 b, MEK inhibition had no effect on Akt phosphorylation by HDL, suggesting that MAP kinase is not an upstream effector of Akt. We also determined the effect of an Akt dominant negative mutant on MAP kinase phosphorylation by HDL. As shown in Fig. 6 c, dominant negative Akt had no effect on HDL stimulation of MAP kinase, but the phosphorylation of eNOS was fully prevented. This suggests that Akt activation is not required for MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by HDL. In the present study, we have demonstrated that HDL stimulation of eNOS occurs through two kinase pathways (Fig.7). By binding to SR-BI, HDL causes eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 via TK-PI3 kinase-mediated activation of Akt kinase. However, concomitant TK-PI3 kinase-mediated stimulation of MAP kinase is necessary in order to enhance eNOS enzymatic activity in response to the lipoprotein. The phosphorylation of eNOS regulates the activation of the enzyme by various stimuli including VEGF, estrogen, and shear stress (16Michell B.J. Griffiths J.E. Mitchelhill K.I. Rodriguez-Crespo I.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30101-30108Google Scholar). We have found that HDL also causes the phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser-1179 and that the phosphorylation is required for the activation of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1, a–c). In contrast to Ser-1179, HDL had no effect on the phosphorylation state of Thr-497 (Fig.1 d), suggesting that the lipoprotein does not regulate eNOS activation through the dephosphorylation of that residue. We also identified Akt as the kinase responsible for HDL-induced eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 (Fig. 2, a–d). HDL stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473, one of the major phosphorylation sites of Akt in the regulatory domain that is often targeted by PI3 kinase (Fig. 2, a and b). The kinase-inactive mutant of Akt (AktAAA) efficiently inhibited HDL-induced eNOS phosphorylation. Furthermore, we determined whether PI3 kinase is an upstream regulator of Akt in the pathway leading to eNOS activation (Fig. 3,a–d). PI3 kinase activates Akt by recruiting the latter to the plasma membrane, which allows the phosphorylation of Akt at two key regulatory sites (Thr-308 and Ser-403), and Akt was recruited to plasma membrane by HDL stimulation (Fig. 2 c). The inhibition of PI3 kinase by wortmannin resulted in decreased Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 (Fig. 3 a). In addition, the selective inhibitor of PI3 kinase LY294002 or dominant negative PI3 kinase also led to decreased eNOS phosphorylation and activation by HDL (Fig. 3,b–d). These cumulative results indicate that PI3 kinase stimulation of Akt leading to eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 is critically involved in the activation of the enzyme by HDL (Fig.7). Additional proximal signaling events have been elucidated. We have demonstrated that a protein TK, most likely an Src family kinase, is a further upstream stimulator of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway (Fig. 4,a–d). Typical PI3 kinase has regulatory subunits with two Src homology 2 domains that allow the enzyme to be activated by phosphotyrosine residues of a TK (39Pawson T. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 87-110Google Scholar, 40Wymann M.P. Pirola L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1436: 127-150Google Scholar). We speculate that HDL binding to SR-BI directly or indirectly causes tyrosine phosphorylation of Src kinase. Both the C-terminal and N-terminal domains of SR-BI are facing the cytoplasm and thus available for interaction with other proteins. At present, there is no evidence that SR-BI binds to a receptor TK or a nonreceptor TK. Further, it is not known whether HDL causes the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue (tyrosine 489) within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of SR-BI, which could potentially bind to Src homology 2-containing adaptor molecules. Detailed studies of possible SR-BI-tyrosine kinase interactions are now warranted. In addition to modulation by PI3 kinase-Akt, MAP kinases are also known to play a role in eNOS regulation by certain agonists (9Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Google Scholar, 25Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Schafer A. Scholz D. Aldershvile J. Busse R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1123-1128Google Scholar, 26Chen Z.

Chem. 2000; 275: 30707-30715Google Scholar). In the present study, we have shown that HDL stimulates MAP kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 5, a–c) and that both PI3 kinase and Src kinase are upstream activators of MAP kinase activation by HDL (Fig. 5, d and e). It has been previously observed that HDL stimulates MAP kinase in EC as well as other cell types (41Nofer J.R. Junker R. Pulawski E. Fobker M. Levkau B. von Eckardstein A. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Walter M. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 85: 730-735Google Scholar, 42Sachinidis A. Kettenhofen R. Seewald S. Gouni-Berthold I. Schmitz U. Seul C. Ko Y. Vetter H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

However, the mechanisms mediating that process were not known prior to the current studies. Furthermore, the activation of MAP kinase is absolutely required for eNOS activation (Fig. 5 f). However, MAP kinase activation does not play a role in HDL-induced Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6 b) or in eNOS phosphorylation (Fig.6 a). Moreover, dominant negative Akt had no effect on MAP kinase activation by HDL (Fig. 6 c). Thus, there is no cross-talk between the Akt kinase and MAP kinase pathways, and the activation of both pathways is necessary for enhanced enzymatic activity in response to HDL (Fig. 7). Further experiments will be needed to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which MAP kinase contributes to eNOS stimulation by HDL, including the potential modulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis. Recently, Li et al. (5Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11058-11063Google Scholar) reported that HDL stimulates eNOS in a ceramide-dependent manner. C2-ceramide stimulates MAP kinase via tyrosine kinase and PI3 kinase-mediated mechanisms in cultured airway smooth muscle cells (44Reunanen N. Westermarck J. Hakkinen L. Holmstrom T.H. Elo I. Eriksson J.E. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5137-5145Google Scholar, 45Conway A. Pyne N.J. Pyne S. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 737-743Google Scholar). It is possible that the HDL stimulation of MAP kinase observed in the present work occurred through ceramide production. Li et al. (5Li X.A. Titlow W.B. Jackson B.A. Giltiay N. Nikolova-Karakashian M. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11058-11063Google Scholar) also showed that HDL does not induce Akt kinase activation in CHO cells expressing eNOS and SR-BI. However, their studies were limited to assessments of Akt phosphorylation in the transfected CHO cells. Discrepancies between the observations made in the two studies may be related to the use of different cell paradigms. In the present work, we used ECs for endogenous Akt phosphorylation and COS M6 cells for cell transfection in which dominant negative mutants were employed to show that Akt is responsible for eNOS phosphorylation and activation (Fig. 2). We also used a combination of PI3 kinase inhibitors (Fig. 3) and dominant negative mutants (Figs. 2 and 3) to confirm the involvement of the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway in HDL-induced eNOS phosphorylation and activation. The eNOS phosphorylation observed in the ovine EC was also confirmed in the human and bovine endothelium. As such, multiple approaches have been employed in the current studies to implicate a key role for Akt kinase and phosphorylation in eNOS activation by HDL. SR-BI is the high affinity HDL receptor, and HDL binding to SR-BI is required for HDL-mediated cholesterol flux (46Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar, 47Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Google Scholar). We showed previously that HDL binding to SR-BI is also required for eNOS activation by HDL (4Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Google Scholar). However, the initiating event that occurs upon HDL binding to SR-BI to cause the proximal processes in signal transduction by the lipoprotein is not known. We speculate that SR-BI mediates the effect of HDL by two possible mechanisms. First, alterations in membrane cholesterol pools may be involved. SR-BI mediates changes in the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane, and SR-BI and eNOS both reside in cholesterol-rich microdomains known as caveolae, which are most likely a subset of lipid rafts, which contain various signaling molecules including MAP kinases. It has been demonstrated that cholesterol alterations induced by β-cyclodextrin activate MAP kinases (48Furuchi T. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21099-21104Google Scholar). Along with potential cholesterol-related mechanisms, there may be involvement of SR-BI C-terminal binding protein(s). Using antibody blockade in isolated EC plasma membranes, we previously showed that the C-terminal domain of SR-BI plays a role in HDL-mediated eNOS stimulation (4Yuhanna I.S. Zhu Y. Cox B.E. Hahner L.D. Osborne-Lawrence S. Lu P. Marcel Y.L. Anderson R.G. Mendelsohn M.E. Hobbs H.H. Shaul P.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 853-857Google Scholar). It is possible that a protein binding to the C terminus of SR-BI mediates signal transduction from SR-BI to a downstream effector such as a G protein and/or Src kinase. A PDZ-containing protein, PDZK1 (also known as CLAMP, Diphor-1, CAP70, or NaPi-Cap1) has been shown to bind to the C-terminal domain of SR-BI and to be involved in cholesterol regulation (49Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar). Now knowing that a Src kinase is critically involved in the proximal signaling events induced by HDL binding to SR-BI, in depth experimentation focused on the possible roles of both cholesterol regulation and SR-BI adaptor proteins in the upstream process can be pursued. The intricate regulation of kinase cascades by HDL shown in this study may help explain the impact of HDL on various other functions in EC. For example, HDL stimulates the migration and proliferation of EC (50Murugesan G. Sa G. Fox P.L. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 1149-1156Google Scholar, 51Tamagaki T. Sawada S. Imamura H. Tada Y. Yamasaki S.

Since Akt is known to have a role in apoptosis, and MAP kinase is involved in the proliferation and migration of EC during reendothelialization after injury to the arterial wall (53Pintucci G. Steinberg B.M. Seghezzi G. Yun J. Apazidis A. Baumann F.G. Grossi E.A. Colvin S.B. Mignatti P. Galloway A.C. Surgery. 1999; 126: 422-427Google Scholar, 54Wang A. Nomura M. Patan S. Ware J.A. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 609-616Google Scholar), it is possible that the modulation of these pathways by HDL may be critical to the regulation of EC turnover and movement. As such, our finding that HDL is a potent stimulus of various kinases in EC enhances both our specific understanding of the capacity of the lipoprotein to modulate NO production and our overall knowledge of other mechanisms by which HDL may be atheroprotective. We thank Helen Hobbs (McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development and Departments of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry) for providing HDL and for insightful discussions and Divya Seetharam for valuable help with experiments of bovine aortic endothelial cells.

However, the mechanism of targeting and the consequence of Set2-dependent methylation have yet to be demonstrated. We sought to identify the protein components associated with Set2 to gain some insights into the in vivo function of this protein. Mass spectrometry analysis of the Set2 complex, purified using a tandem affinity method, revealed that RNA polymerase II (pol II) is associated with Set2. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation using antibodies against subunits of pol II confirmed that the phosphorylated form of pol II is indeed an integral part of the Set2 complex.

Nucleosomal structure, once thought to be quite static, turns out to be extremely dynamic and tightly regulated by various nonhistone proteins (1Workman J.L. Kingston R.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 545-579Google Scholar). These protein modulators can be generally categorized into two groups: those that utilize the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to alter histone-DNA contacts (2Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Google Scholar), and those that are capable of modifying histones covalently. To date, the known histone modifications include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubquitinylation, and ADP-ribosylation (3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar, 4Berger S.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 142-148Google Scholar). The consequence of complex histone modification patterns has yet to be fully understood. However, based on a growing body of evidence, a “histone code” hypothesis has been proposed suggesting that these modifications either directly alter chromatin structure (5Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar) or create a series of molecular “bar codes” at the nucleosome surface for other proteins to recognize (3Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Google Scholar, 6Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Google Scholar). Most, if not all, chromatin modulators have a somewhat weak intrinsic affinity for their nucleosomal substrates in vitro. Nevertheless, the specific pattern of histone modifications and the particular loci where chromatin remodeling occurs throughout the genome strongly suggest that these activities are primarily targeted to certain regions by either DNA bound activators or repressors (7Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Google Scholar, 8Peterson C.L. Workman J.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 187-192Google Scholar). Acidic activators have been shown to be able to target SWI/SNF or Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltranferase to local promoters, thereby facilitating transcription from nucleosomal templates (9Natarajan K.

Hahn S. Peterson C.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2369-2374Google Scholar). Likewise, the repressor Ume6 or co-repressor Ssn6/Tup1 can recruit histone deacetylase complexes to remove the acetylation marks from histone tails, facilitating transcriptional repression (13Watson A.D.

Nature. 1998; 392: 831-835Google Scholar, 17Kadosh D. Struhl K. Cell. 1997; 89: 365-371Google Scholar). In addition to activator/repressor-dependent targeting of chromatin-modifying complexes, histone modifications, as proposed in the “histone code” hypothesis, can also provide recognition sites for protein complexes and enzymatic activities. For instance, the binding of Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltranferase or SWI/SNF to promoter nucleosomes is facilitated by bromodomain recognition of acetylated histone tails (18Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Cell. 2001; 104: 817-827Google Scholar, 19Hassan A.H. Prochasson P. Neely K.E. Galasinski S.C. Chandy M. Carrozza M.J. Workman J.L. Cell. 2002; 111: 369-379Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation of histone H3 serine 10 stimulates K14 acetylation by Gcn5 on the same tail (20Lo W.S. Duggan L. Tolga N.C. Emre Belotserkovskya R. Lane W.S. Shiekhattar R. Berger S.L.

Cell. 2000; 5: 917-926Google Scholar), suggesting that cross-talk can occur between different modifications. More strikingly, modifications of different histones can also influence each other in a specific manner. Ubiquitinylation of histone H2B is required for both methylation of lysine 4 by Set1 and lysine 79 by Dot1, but not vice versa (22Ng H.H. Xu R.M. Zhang Y. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34655-34657Google Scholar, 23Briggs S.D. Xiao T. Sun Z.W. Caldwell J.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 498Google Scholar, 24Sun Z.W. Allis C.D.

The carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; 6-AU, 6-azauracil; TAP, tandem affinity purification; pol II, RNA polymerase II 1The abbreviations used are: CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; 6-AU, 6-azauracil; TAP, tandem affinity purification; pol II, RNA polymerase II of Rpb1, the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II, plays an important role in transcription regulation (25Kobor M.

It is acutely controlled by four reported CTD kinases: Kin28 (34Cismowski M.J. Laff G.M. Solomon M.J. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2983-2992Google Scholar, 35Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q.

Davidson A.R. Young R.A. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated pol II interacts with the mediator complex and is assembled into the preinitiation complex during transcription initiation (30Lu H. Flores O. Weinmann R. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10004-10008Google Scholar). The CTD is then phosphorylated by CTD kinases to start promoter clearance and elongation, causing dissociation of some factors responsible for preinitiation complex formation (41Svejstrup J.Q. Li Y. Fellows J. Gnatt A. Bjorklund S. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6075-6078Google Scholar) and allowing other factors necessary for elongation and termination to bind (25Kobor M. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Google Scholar). Phosphorylation sites predominantly reside at serine 5 and serine 2 of the CTD repeats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that serine 5 phosphorylation is localized to promoter regions at initiation/early elongation stages, whereas serine 2 phosphorylation is associated with the coding region during the elongation phase (42Komarnitsky P. Cho E.J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2452-2460Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies have shown that the pol II holoenzyme possesses certain intrinsic chromatin-modifying activities that may help pol II elongate through chromatin. Elp3, a subunit of pol II elongating holoenzyme, has histone acetyltransferase activity (43Wittschieben B.O. Otero G. de Bizemont T. Fellows J. Erdjument- Bromage H. Ohba R. Li Y. Allis C.D. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 123-128Google Scholar). Human RNA polymerase II complex directly interacts with the histone acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF. p300 specifically recognizes the unphosphorylated form and p300/CBP associated factor (PCAF) associates with the phosphorylated form (44Cho H. Orphanides G. Sun X. Yang X.J. Ogryzko V. Lees E. Nakatani Y. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5355-5363Google Scholar). Histone methylation occurs at many residues within all four histones, implying that it could have a critical impact on chromatin structural regulation (5Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar). Recent identification of novel histone methyltransferases have implicated histone methylation in many important biological processes, such as heterochromatic silencing, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression (7Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 198-209Google Scholar, 45Zhang Y. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2343-2360Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of SUV39, the first identified histone methyltransferase, locates within an evolutionarily conserved “SET” domain and is flanked by two other cysteine-rich domains (46Rea S. Eisenhaber F. O'Carroll D. Strahl B.D. Sun Z.W. Schmid M. Opravil S. Mechtler K. Ponting C.P. Allis C.D. Jenuwein T. Nature. 2000; 406: 593-599Google Scholar). These structural motifs have been used as a standard to search for other histone methyltransferase candidates. In the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there are 6 SET domain proteins. Set1 and Set2 can methylate histone H3 lysine 4 and lysine 36 (47–51). In addition, a high-copy disruptor of silencing, Dot1, which has very weak homology with other methyltransferases, has also been found to methylate histone H3 at lysine 79 in a nucleosomal context (52Feng Q. Wang H. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Struhl K. Zhang Y. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1052-1058Google Scholar, 53Lacoste N. Utley R.T. Hunter J.M. Poirier G.G. Cote J. J. Biol.

Struhl K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1518-1527Google Scholar). The methyltransferase activities of these enzymes are essential for their related biological function, but how these chromatin modifying enzymes are tethered to specific loci remains largely unknown. To investigate the potential targeting mechanism of histone methyltransferases, we chose to first identify the proteins that are associated with Set2in vivo. Mass spectrometry analysis of the Set2 complex purified using a tandem affinity method revealed that Set2 physically associates with RNA polymerase II. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies against different phosphorylated states of the pol II CTD showed that Set2 methyltransferase activity primarily associates with the elongating form of the RNA polymerase II that is hyperphosphorylated. This implies that methylation mediated by Set2 may be involved in regulating transcription and elongation. Genetic interaction between Set2 and transcription elongation factor-TFIIS further strengthened this argument. Moreover, the CTD plays an important role in H3 K36 methylation in vivo. These data are consistent with the results of three other groups who independently discovered the interaction of Set2 with the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II (56Li J. Moazed D. Gygi S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49383-49388Google Scholar). 2N. J. Krogan, M. Kim, A. Tong, A. Gorshani, G. Cagney, V. Canadien, D. Richards, B. Beattie, A. Emili, C. Boone, A. Shilatifard, S.

YBL102 (Set2- TAP::TRP1) and YBL139 (ΔSET2::URA3) were made by PCR-based tagging strategy with the vector pBS1479 (59Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M.

The TAP tag was integrated at the carboxyl terminus of the endogenous SET2loci and confirmed by PCR and Western blotting with peroxidase-anti-peroxidase (Sigma), which recognizes the protein A module of the tag. Yeast strain CMKy80 (ppr2Δ::URA3) is a gift from Dr. Kane and has been described (61Davie J.K. Kane C.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5960-5973Google Scholar). YBL155 (set2Δ ppr2Δ) is a haploid strain generated from a cross between YBL150 (set2Δ::LEU2) and CMKy80. RNA polymerase II CTD truncation mutants were provided by J. Corden (62West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar). Strain RPB1, rpb1 9CTD, 10 CTD, and 14 CTD are constructed by introducing individual plasmid pY1 (containing wild-type CTD), Y1WT (9Natarajan K. Jackson B.M. Zhou H. Winston F. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol Cell. 1999; 4: 657-664Google Scholar), pY1WT (10Brown C.E. Howe L. Sousa K. Alley S.C. Carrozza M.J. Tan S. Workman J.L. Science. 2001; 292: 2333-2337Google Scholar), or pY1WT (14Vogelauer M. Wu J. Suka N. Grunstein M. Nature. 2000; 408: 495-498Google Scholar) into Z26 (MAT alpha his3Δ200 ura3–52 leu2–3,112 rpb1Δ187::HIS3 GAL+(pRP112)), then shuffling out plasmid pRP112. The TAP purification was performed essentially as described elsewhere (59Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar, 60Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) with minor modification. Briefly, 6 liters of yeast cells expressing TAP-tagged Set2 were grown in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose medium at 30 °C to an optical density of about 2 at 600 nm. The cell pellet was resuspended in an extraction buffer (E buffer) (40 mm HEPES pH 7.5; 350 mm NaCl; 10% glycerol; 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate; 10 mm NaF; and 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, supplemented with complete sets of fresh proteinase inhibitors) and disrupted in a bead beater (Biospec). Crude whole-cell extracts were then clarified by ultracentrifugation and directly applied to IgG-Sepharose and calmodulin resin as described previously (59Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar, 60Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar), with the exception that all buffers contained 10% glycerol. The purified complex was resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and visualized with silver staining. Excised protein bands were subjected to mass spectrometry as described in previously (63Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Google Scholar). In vitrohistone methylation reactions were carried out for 1 h at 30 °C in a 25-μl system containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0); 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mmMgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μl of [3H]methyl S-adenosyl-methionine (80 Ci/mmol,Amersham Biosciences) with 2 μg of HeLa oligonucleosomes or recombinant yeast histone octamers as substrates. Half of the reaction was then spotted on Whatman P-81 filter paper for liquid scintillation counting and the other half was separated on an 18% SDS-PAGE gel, stained with Coomassie Blue, and fluorographed with En3hance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (64Grant P.A. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 119: 311-317Google Scholar). The biotinylated CTD peptides (about 1.5 μg) were bound to 0.5 mg of streptavidin-coated Dynabeads M280) in 50 μl of high salt binding buffer (25 mmTris-HCl pH 8.0; 1 m NaCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 5% glycerol; 0.03% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 2 h. The protein-bound beads were washed once with high salt binding buffer and twice with CTD binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 8.0; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 5% glycerol; 0.03% Nonidet P-40) and finally resuspended in 50 μl of CTD binding buffer. Five hundred nanograms of bacterially overexpressed GST-Set2 protein was mixed with the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h on a Dyna-Mixer (Dynal). Following washing three times with CTD binding buffer, beads were then subjected to an in vitro HMT assay. Wild-type and set2Δ (YBL150) strains were transformed with the ARS/CEN plasmid pRS316 prior to the test. All yeast strains were grown in the synthetic media lacking uracil to an OD600 of 1, then plated onto −Ura synthetic drop-out plates supplemented with 25 μg/ml, 50 μg/ml, or 100 μg/ml of 6-azauracil (Sigma). Cells were allowed to grow 2–4 days at 30 °C before photographs were taken. Histone methylation and HMTs have been extensively investigated by different research groups, however, the mechanism regarding how histone methyltransferases are targeted to specific loci has yet to be carefully addressed. In an effort to determine a potential targeting mechanism of histone methyltransferases, we decided to identify proteins associated with a known histone methyltransferase and gain some insights from these protein partners. Histone methyltransferase Set2 was chosen to start, because Set2 possesses very robust HMT activity on nucleosomal substrates (48Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Google Scholar, 55Ng H.H. Feng Q. Wang H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Struhl K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1518-1527Google Scholar) and has been shown to regulate transcription on tethering to a heterologous promoter (48Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W. Bone J.R. Caldwell J.A. Mollah S. Cook R.G. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1298-1306Google Scholar). We took advantage of a tandem affinity purification (TAP) technique (59Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar, 60Rigaut G. Shevchenko A. Rutz B. Wilm M. Mann M. Seraphin B. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 1030-1032Google Scholar) to isolate potential partners of Set2 in vivo. TAP-tag with a TRP1 marker was PCR-amplified from vector pBS1479 and integrated to the carboxyl termini of the chromosomal copy ofSET2. TAP-tagged Set2 strain was confirmed by PCR and Western blotting with PAP (Sigma). Yeast whole-cell extracts from the Set2-TAP strain were prepared and subsequently applied to IgG-Sepharose and calmodulin resin. Purified Set2 complex was then separated on a SDS-PAGE gel and subjected to protein fingerprinting by mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 A). Protein identification of the Set2 complex revealed that two of the largest components in the Set2 complex are Rpb1 and Rpb2, the two largest subunits of RNA polymerase II. Moreover, the silver staining pattern of the complex excluding Set2 (as labeled in Fig.1 A) is very similar to that of previously purified RNA polymerase II, suggesting that the complex we isolated by this approach is likely a Set2 bound RNA polymerase II complex. To confirm the mass spectrometry identification, we performed immunoblotting with some of the available antibodies against different forms of pol II to determine whether the corresponding antibodies can recognize the components identified by mass spectrometry. Western blotting using antibody against the Rpb3 subunit of pol II demonstrated that Rpb3 is an integral part of the Set2 complex. Taf6 antibodies were used as a negative control (Fig. 1 B). The Rpb1 subunit of pol II has different isoforms in regard to the phosphorylation status of its CTD. Monoclonal antibodies H5 (against CTD-serine 2-Pi) and H14 (against CTD-serine 5-Pi) were able to pick up the low abundant signals from whole-cell extracts. However, they react strongly with the TAP purified fraction. Conversely, using antibody 8WG16 (which recognizes unphosphorylated CTD), we found that although the unphosphorylated CTD is relatively more abundant in crude extracts, it was not enriched by our purification (Fig. 2 A). We believe that the faint signal in the Set2-TAP fraction with 8WG16 antibody is probably due to weak cross-reactivity of this antibody with phosphorylated forms of CTD (65Cho E.J. Kobor M.S. Kim M. Greenblatt J. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3319-3329Google Scholar). Previously, RNA polymerase II has been purified through a method that combines conventional chromatograph and immunoaffinity column using 8WG16 antibody (66Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Google Scholar, 67Myers L.C. Leuther K. Bushnell D.A. Gustafsson C.M. Kornberg R.D. Methods. 1997; 12: 212-216Google Scholar). This method efficiently enriches unphosphorylated RNA polymerase II, but it inevitably loses some protein components that only interact with phosphorylated polymerase II. This may be the reason why Set2 was not found in previously isolated pol II. To further characterize the Set2 methylase-bound RNA polymerase, and rule out the possibility that Set2 might bind separately to a subset of pol II, we thus subjected the purified Set2 complex directly onto a gel filtration column. Eluted fractions were either subjected to Western blotting to detect the presence of proteins (Fig. 2 A) or assayed for histone methyltransferase activity (Fig. 2 B). The peak fraction containing the bulk of Rpb1 (H5, serine 2-Pi-CTD) and Rpb3 co-fractionate with histone methyltransferase activity, suggesting that Set2 is an integral component of a phosphorylated RNA polymerase II complex. Based on the elution profile of the gel filtration column, we estimate that molecular mass of this complex is about 700 kDa, which is consistent with the previously reported molecular mass of pol II (about 550–600 kDa) plus the mass of Set2-CBP (about 95 kDa) (66Edwards A.M. Darst S.A. Feaver W.J. Thompson N.E. Burgess R.R. Kornberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2122-2126Google Scholar, 68Donaldson I.M. Friesen J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13780-13788Google Scholar, 69Mueller C.L. Jaehning J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1971-1980Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate that Set2 physically associates with the hyperphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II. The histone methyltransferase Set2 primarily associates with the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II but not the unphosphorylated form, implying that the CTD likely contributes to this specific interaction. We next sought to determine whether the CTD is directly involved in this interaction and if the CTD alone is sufficient to support Set2-pol II interaction. Using a defined synthetic CTD peptide with different combinations of phosphorylation at serine 2 and serine 5, Ho and Shuman have successfully demonstrated the interaction between mammalian guanylytransferase and the CTD phosphopeptide (70Ho C.K. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 405-411Google Scholar). We thus adopted a similar system where biotinylated synthetic peptides consisting of 4 tandem repeats of the CTD heptad sequence (YSPTSPS) are used. The CTD peptide only contains 4 repeats of heptapeptides, whereas CTD-serine 2-Pi and CTD-serine 5-Pi have a phosphate group on all 4 specific serines in each peptide. These peptides were bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads in a high salt buffer and washed extensively to remove unbound proteins. Peptide-bound beads were then adjusted to a low salt buffer and incubated with purified, bacterially overexpressed GST-Set2 protein. Measurement of histone methyltransferase activity was subsequently taken for bound fractions and unbound fraction (supernatant) (Fig.3). Fluorography showed that both the serine 2-Pi and serine 5-Pi CTD peptide beads can efficiently pull down HMT activity from solution, whereas unmodified CTD fails to do so (Fig. 3 A). Using a more quantitative liquid scintillation counting assay (Fig. 3 B), we demonstrated that the serine 2-Pi CTD peptide displays relatively stronger affinity to GST-Set2 than the serine 5-Pi CTD peptide, which is consistent with the Western blot in Fig. 1 B. Therefore, we conclude that phosphorylation of the CTD is sufficient to determine the binding of Set2 to RNA polymerase II in vitro. To determine whether the specific interaction between Set2 and RNA polymerase II can serve as a signal to regulate the recruitment of histone methyltransferase activity of Set2 to its target in vivo, we measured the relative methylation levels of histones in RNA polymerase II CTD truncation mutants. Although removal of all the CTD repeats are lethal, deletion of a significant number of repeats can be tolerated by cells (62West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar, 71Nonet M. Sweetser D. Young R.A. Cell. 1987; 50: 909-915Google Scholar). Three CTD truncation mutants containing 9, 10, and 14 repeats, respectively and an isogenic wild-type strain (with 26 repeats) (62West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar) were tested for the histone methylation level by Western blotting using specific antibodies against the modified histones (Fig. 4). We found that there exists a good correlation between the relative level of methylation of H3 at lysine 36 and the degree of CTD truncation. In particular, the CTD mutant containing 9 repeats displays a significant reduction of K36 methylation. This correlation is consistent with growth phenotype of these mutants, where only the mutant containing 9 repeats shows temperature sensitivity (62West M.L. Corden J.L. Genetics. 1995; 140: 1223-1233Google Scholar). More importantly, this methylation defect occurs specifically at lysine 36, which is mediated by Set2 (48Strahl B.D. Grant P.A. Briggs S.D. Sun Z.W.

The existence of nonreceptor guanine nucleotide exchange factors for G proteins has also been postulated. Yeast two-hybrid screens with Gαo and Gαs as baits were performed to identify binding partners of these proteins. Two mammalian homologs of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein Ric-8 were identified in these screens: Ric-8A (Ric-8/synembryn) and Ric-8B. Purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant Ric-8A revealed that it is a potent guanine nucleotide exchange factor for a subset of Gα proteins including Gαq, Gαi1, and Gαo, but not Gαs. The mechanism of Ric-8A-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange was elucidated. Ric-8A interacts with GDP-bound Gα proteins, stimulates release of GDP, and forms a stable nucleotide-free transition state complex with the Gα protein; this complex dissociates upon binding of GTP to Gα.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Google Scholar). Traditionally, activation of heterotrimeric G proteins1 is accomplished exclusively by the action of GPCRs, seven transmembrane-spanning proteins that typically reside in the plasma membrane. These receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), binding the inactive GDP-bound conformation of G proteins and stimulating release of GDP from Gα. To ensure directionality of exchange, GEFs stabilize a nucleotide-free transition state of Gα that is disrupted by binding of GTP (2Bornancin F. Pfister C. Chabre M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 687-698Google Scholar, 3Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Google Scholar). This facilitates dissociation of Gα·GTP from the Gβγ dimer and release of these proteins from the receptor. Dissociated G protein subunits then participate in interactions with a variety of effectors. G protein signaling is attenuated when Gα hydrolyzes the γ phosphate of its bound GTP and Gα·GDP reassociates with βγ. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) facilitate the inactivation of many G proteins. Most of these GAPs contain a regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain that binds preferentially to the Gα·GTP transition state and accelerates GTPase activity (4Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 86: 445-452Google Scholar, 5Yowe D. Yu K. Wilkie T.M. Popov S. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 344: 647-657Google Scholar). More than 20 unique RGS domain-containing proteins have been discovered, and the nature of their G protein specificity and their mode of action in cells are subjects of intense interest (6De Vries L. Zheng B. Fischer T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 235-271Google Scholar, 7Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Google Scholar). Nonreceptor activators of G proteins may operate in lieu of or in conjunction with GPCRs to enhance signaling, but their physiological role is not well understood (8Sato M. Ribas C. Hildebrandt J.D. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30052-30060Google Scholar, 9Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38772-39778Google Scholar). Activators of G protein signaling AGS1 and AGS3 were identified in a genetic screen in yeast designed to isolate expressed mammalian cDNAs that encode proteins that bypass the need for a receptor (12Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33202-33205Google Scholar). AGS3 possesses Gα guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor activity but may activate G proteins by liberating Gβγ (10Bernard M.L. Peterson Y.K. Chung P. Jourdan J. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1585-1593Google Scholar, 13De Vries L. Fischer T. Tronchere H. Brothers G.M. Strockbine B. Siderovski D.P. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 14364-14369Google Scholar). AGS1 encodes a Ras-like small GTPase that, when bound to GTP, possesses in vitro guanine nucleotide exchange activity for members of the Gi subfamily of G proteins (9Cismowski M.J. Ma C. Ribas C. Xie X. Spruyt M. Lizano J.S. Lanier S.M. Duzic E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23421-23424Google Scholar). Other newly appreciated proteins may also act as novel modulators or effectors of heterotrimeric G proteins. Genetic evidence indicates that synaptic transmission in Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by an antagonistic Gq/Go signaling network that regulates intracellular concentrations of diacylglycerol (14Lackner M.R. Nurrish S.J. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 335-346Google Scholar, 15Nurrish S. Segalat L. Kaplan J.M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 231-242Google Scholar, 16Miller K.G. Emerson M.D. Rand J.B. Neuron. 1999; 24: 323-333Google Scholar). Gαq is thought to enhance synaptic transmission by activation of phospholipase Cβ, an enzyme that cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate (for review, see Ref. 17Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 475-509Google Scholar). Activation of Go negatively influences synaptic transmission, hypothetically by lowering concentrations of diacylglycerol (mechanism unknown). Mutant screening and suppression analyses have revealed proteins that likely operate in conjunction with Gαq or Gαo in this pathway (18Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Google Scholar, 19Hajdu-Cronin Y.M. Chen W.J. Patikoglou G. Koelle M.R. Sternberg P.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1780-1793Google Scholar). One class of these mutations was termed RIC (resistant toinhibitors of cholinesterase). They were selected for their ability to survive the neurotoxic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors by causing a decrease in the amount of acetylcholine released at the synapse (18Miller K.G. Alfonso A. Nguyen M. Crowell J.A. Johnson C.D. Rand J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12593-12598Google Scholar). The gene that complemented the ric-8 mutant allele, RIC-8/synembryn, appears to promote synaptic transmission much like Gαq. However, the sequence of the encoded protein was not revealing (20Miller K.G. Emerson M.D. McManus J.R. Rand J.B. Neuron. 2000; 27: 289-299Google Scholar). A more recent study also demonstrated that reduction of function mutations of C. elegans RIC-8 or GAO-1 affects a pathway that regulates the movement of centrosomes in dividing embryos (21Miller K.G. Rand J.B. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1649-1660Google Scholar). In an effort to identify novel G protein signaling factors, we initiated yeast two-hybrid screens with Gαo and Gαs as baits and found that two mammalian homologs of Ric-8/synembryn, which we have termed Ric-8A and Ric-8B, are in fact Gα-binding proteins. Purification and biochemical characterization of recombinant Ric-8A revealed that it is a potent guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Gαq, Gαi1, and Gαo but not Gαs. The mechanism of Ric-8A-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange was elucidated. Ric-8A interacts with GDP-bound Gα subunits in the absence of Gβγ, causing release of GDP and formation of a stable, nucleotide-free Gα·Ric-8A complex. GTP, but not GDP, and then binds to Gα and disrupts the complex, releasing Ric-8A and the activated Gα protein. The open reading frames of wild type and the activated (GTPase-deficient, Q227L of Gαs) mutants of Gαs long, Gαo, Gαq, Gαi1, and Gα13 were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides containing BamHI and/orSalI linkers. The respective Gα PCR products were digested and cloned into these same sites in the LexA two-hybrid bait vector, pVJL11 (22Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Google Scholar). To initiate two-hybrid screens, the LexA-Gαo and LexA-Gαs bait constructs were transformed into the L40 yeast strain using the TE-lithium acetate/PEG-4000 transformation method (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence L.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Yeast harboring these bait plasmids were then transformed with a rat brain embryonic cDNA library contained in a pVP16 activation domain prey vector (a gift of Thomas Südhof, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Approximately 106 individual transformants were screened with each bait. For studies of pairwise two-hybrid interactions, yeast co-transformed with specific bait and prey fusion combinations growing in liquid culture were spotted onto complete synthetic medium plates lacking tryptophan and leucine, grown, and subjected to a β-galactosidase filter assay as described (24Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Google Scholar). The rat RIC-8A prey clone isolated in the two-hybrid screen lacked the first 9 coding nucleotides of the equivalent mouse and human RIC-8/synembryn sequences in the data base. These missing nucleotides were repaired by PCR with codons for the first three amino acids of mouse RIC-8/synembryn (NP_444424). These residues are identical among mouse and human Ric-8A and C. elegans Ric-8. The repaired rat RIC-8A PCR product was cloned into the baculovirus donor construct, pFastBacGSTTev. pFastBacGSTTev was created by inserting a GST tag and a Tev protease cleavage site into the vector pFastBac-1 (Invitrogen, Inc.). The open reading frame of the rat RIC-8B clone obtained in the two-hybrid screen was amplified by PCR with a 5′ oligonucleotide containing a BamHI linker and an oligonucleotide that annealed 3′ to the gene in the prey vector. This product was digested with BamHI and SalI and cloned into the His-tagged baculovirus donor vector pFastBacHTa (Invitrogen). To clone the human cDNA transcripts that encode the 531 and the putative 401-amino acid Ric-8A variants (see “Results”), total RNA was prepared from HeLa cells using an RNeasy Maxiprep kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was generated using a RETROscript kit (Ambion, Inc.). The human RIC-8A cDNA encoding the 531-amino acid protein was amplified using PCR primers derived from the DNA sequence in GenBankTM (AL390088). Primers designed to amplify the hypothetical 401-amino acid variant were derived from the incomplete cDNA sequence (AK022870) found in GenBankTM, but we were not able to amplify any product from either HeLa or NTERA2 cell cDNA. This variant was generated using the 531-amino acid protein-encoding cDNA as PCR template and a 3′ PCR primer that corrected the missing single base pair insertion of this putative cDNA. Both amplified products contained EcoRI andSalI linkers added by the primers. The products were digested with these restriction enzymes and cloned into those restriction sites in the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 (25Andersson S. Davis D.N. Dahlback H. Jornvall H. Russell D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8222-8229Google Scholar), the two-hybrid prey vector pGADGH (26Hannon G.J. Demetrick D. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2378-2391Google Scholar), pFastBacHTa (Invitrogen, Inc.), and pFastBacGSTTev. Baculoviruses encoding GST-Ric-8A and His6-Ric-8B were produced and amplified using methods in the Bac-to-Bac Sf9 cell transfection system (Invitrogen, Inc.). To prepare the recombinant Ric-8A, Sf9 cells growing in IPL41 medium with 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.1% pluronic acid, 1% chemically defined lipid concentrate (Invitrogen), and 10 μg/ml gentamicin at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml were infected for 48 h with amplified GST-Ric-8A baculoviruses. These cells were pelleted and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmNaHepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone,N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine-chloromethyl ketone, leupeptin, and lima bean trypsin inhibitor; Sigma)) by nitrogen cavitation. GST-Ric-8A was purified from the 100,000 ×g supernatant fraction of these lysates by adsorbtion to glutathione Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion protein was eluted from the washed glutathione Sepharose with lysis buffer containing 20 mm reduced glutathione and then exchanged into lysis buffer. To remove the GST tag, the glutathione resin with attached GST-Ric-8A protein was washed with lysis buffer and incubated with Tev protease (Invitrogen) for 16 h at 4 °C. The cleaved, eluted Ric-8A protein (amino acid sequence G-E-F-Ric-8A) was further purified on a Hi-trap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (150 mm to 1 m). The active protein eluted at ∼375 mm NaCl and was exchanged into lysis buffer. Active Tev-digested Ric-8A was resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE and visualized with Coomassie Blue; it was also trypsinized and subjected to mass spectrometry. Despite the fact that Tev-digested Ric-8A co-migrated with protein standards of ∼75 kDa on SDS-PAGE, the predicted mass of the purified protein (>95%) of 60.1 kDa was confirmed by mass spectrometry (C. Thomas, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Attempts to purify nonaggregated His6-Ric-8B have been unsuccessful to date. Myristoylated Gαo and nonmyristoylated Gαi1were purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (27Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 146-163Google Scholar). Myristoylated Gαi1 containing a His6tag inserted after amino acid 121 was purified from E. coliand was a gift from Roger K. Sunahara (University of Michigan). Gαs short was purified from E. coli and was a gift from Mark E. Hatley (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). Gαq and β1γ2 dimers were purified from Sf9 cells as previously described (28Kozasa T. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Baco Raton, FL1999: 23-38Google Scholar). GST-Ric-8A affinity resin or control resin was prepared by incubating purified GST-Ric-8A (37 μg) or buffer with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (bed volume, 25 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C in extraction buffer (20 mmNaHepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 1% C12E10). The resin was collected by brief centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of extraction buffer. Rat brain membrane extracts were prepared by homogenizing whole rat brains in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 11% sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g to remove debris, and the supernatant was sequentially centrifuged at 12,000 × gand 100,000 × g. The 100,000 × gpellet (P100 membranes) was solubilized for 1 h in extraction buffer and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g. A volume of detergent extract corresponding to 8 mg of extracted membrane protein was then incubated with the GST-Ric-8A and control glutathione resins. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the resins were washed twice with 1 ml of extraction buffer, suspended in 45 μl of extraction buffer and incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of recombinant Tev protease (Invitrogen). The resins were collected by centrifugation, and the soluble proteins released by Tev protease were resolved by SDS-PAGE; the gels also contained purified G protein subunit standards. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blotted with the following G protein subunit-specific antisera: W082, Gαq (29Pang I.H. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18707-18712Google Scholar); S214, Gαo (30Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1993; 90: 3675-3679Google Scholar). To visualize the bands recognized by G protein antisera, the blots were processed with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and treated with SuperSignal West Femto chemiluminescent reagent (Pierce) diluted 3-fold in phosphate-buffered saline. Purified myristoylated Gαi1 (600 nm) was incubated in 500 μl of HEMNDL buffer (20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 2 mm MgSO4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% C12E10) containing either 30 μm GDP; 30 μm GTPγS; or 10 mmNaF, 30 μm AlCl3, and 30 μm GDP for 1 h at 30 °C. Purified GST-Ric-8A was then added to a final concentration of 200 nm, and these reactions were incubated for an additional 20 min at 20 °C. Glutathione-Sepharose (bed volume, 25 μl) in HEMNDL buffer was added, and the reactions were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The resin was collected and washed consecutively with three 1-ml aliquots of cold HEMNDL buffer containing the respective nucleotide and/or AlF4−1 and then boiled in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. Nonmyristoylated Gαi1 was chosen for gel filtration analysis in lieu of myristoylated Gαi1 protein because the myristoylated protein and its associated detergent gave aberrant elution profiles on gel filtration columns. Nonmyristoylated Gαi1 (26 μm) was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C with either 260 μm [35S]GTPγS or [α-32P]GDP in gel filtration buffer (20 mmNaHepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm MgSO4, 1 mmEDTA, and protease inhibitor mixture). The reaction mixtures were then diluted 2-fold by the addition of Tev-digested Ric-8A to a final concentration of 10 μm in gel filtration buffer and were subsequently incubated for 5 min at 22 °C. The mixtures were applied to tandem Superdex 75/200 columns (HR 10/30) and resolved at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. The amount of protein and radiolabeled nucleotide in each fraction was determined by Bradford assay and scintillation counting, respectively. A fixed volume of each odd-numbered fraction (based on a sample of 750 ng of protein in the peak protein-containing fraction) was resolved by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized with Coomassie Blue. The kinetics of GTPγS binding was assessed using a filter binding method (34Sternweis P.C. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13806-13813Google Scholar). The reactions with myristoylated Gαi1, myristoylated Gαo, and Gαs contained 20 mm NaHepes, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm free Mg2+, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05% C12E10. The reaction mixture for Gαq was identical except that 0.05% Genapol C-100 detergent was used instead of C12E10. For each reaction, Tev-digested Ric-8A (200 nm) was first added to reaction buffer and 10 μm [35S]GTPγS (10,000 cpm/pmol). To initiate the reactions, each Gα protein was added to a final concentration of 200 nm. Duplicate aliquots were removed at indicated times, and binding of radioactive nucleotide was stopped by the addition of ice-cold buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.05% C12E10, and 1 mm GTP. The quenched reactions were passed through BA-85 nitrocellulose filters and washed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgSO4); the filters were dried and subjected to liquid scintillation counting. All of the reactions were conducted at 20 °C with the exception of those with Gαi1, which were performed at 30 °C. Steady-state GTPase reactions with Gαq were conducted at 20 °C in buffer containing 0.05% Genapol C-100, 1 μm[γ-32P]GTP (40,000 cpm/pmol), and the indicated amounts of Tev-digested Ric-8A and/or Gβ1γ2. The reactions were initiated by adding purified Gαq or Gαqβ1γ2 to a final concentration of 45 nm. Aliquots of the reactions were removed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min, and the amount of released Pi was quantified using a charcoal-based method (35Wang J. Tu Y. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P. Biddlecome G.H. Ross E.M. Manning D.R. G Proteins: Techniques of Analysis. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999: 123-151Google Scholar). L40 yeast expressing LexA bait fusion proteins of the activated (GTPase-deficient) mutants of Gαo and Gαs long were transformed with a rat brain pVP16-cDNA fusion library. Approximately 106individual transformants were screened with each bait using theHIS3 reporter of L40 and a β-galactosidase filter assay (24Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of 240 plasmids rescued from positive Gαo transformants revealed cDNA inserts that encode portions of several previously identified Gα-interacting proteins, including: GRIN1 (36Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26931-26938Google Scholar), GRIN2 (36Chen L.T. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26931-26938Google Scholar), Ras GAP III (37Jiang Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Google Scholar), AGS3 (12Takesono A. Cismowski M.J. Ribas C. Bernard M. Chung P. Hazard III, S. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1997; 390: 525-529Google Scholar), and RGS17 (RGSZ2) (38Jordan J.D. Carey K.D. Stork P.J.S. Iyengar R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21507-21510Google Scholar). One of the clones encoded an open reading frame, less the first three amino acids, that shared 97% amino acid identity with mouse Ric-8/synembryn (NP_444424) and 87% amino acid identity with the predicted sequence of a 531-amino acid human hypothetical protein (NP_068751). We have named these homologs Ric-8A. The rat Ric-8A protein found in the two-hybrid screen is compared with three different putative human Ric-8A proteins in Fig.1 A. The human RIC-8A cDNAs that encode proteins of 531 and 537 amino acids are likely the products of alternative RNA splicing. The sequence of a cDNA encoding the 531-amino acid variant was verified from a clone isolated from HeLa cells (not shown). Inspection of the complete human RIC-8A genomic sequence contained in a BAC clone (AC069287) revealed that the 531- and 537-amino acid encoding transcripts could be produced by the use of two alternative consensus splice acceptor sites of exon 7 (not shown). The hypothetical RIC-8A transcript predicted to encode the 401-amino acid Ric-8A protein is derived from insertion of a single base pair at codon 395 of the transcript encoding the 531-residue protein. Interestingly, this frameshift would result in synthesis of a protein with five different carboxyl-terminal amino acids and a new stop codon that form a consensus CAAX box of the type that would be modified with a geranylgeranyl moiety (Fig. 1 A) (41Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Google Scholar). However, all attempts to verify the existence of this apparent point mutation using the cDNA source reported in GenBankTM (AK022870) have been unsuccessful. Twenty-three positive clones were obtained using Gαs as bait, and of these, none encoded previously known Gα-interacting proteins. One positive clone shared significant sequence identity with the human cDNA FLJ10620 (NM_018157). Human FLJ10620 encodes a protein of 536 amino acid residues that shares ∼40% amino acid identity with mouse Ric-8/synembryn (Ric-8A). The rat clone obtained in the two-hybrid screen encodes a 520-residue protein. The amino-terminal 483 residues of this protein are 86% identical to the amino-terminal 483 amino acids of human FLJ10620. The remaining carboxyl-terminal amino acids of both proteins are completely divergent. We have named FLJ10620 and its rat homolog Ric-8B (Fig. 1 B). Analysis of the RIC-8B genomic sequence from a compilation of BAC clones revealed that the Human cDNA FLJ10620 contains an extra 3′ splice site that was not utilized in the Rat RIC-8B cDNA we obtained. This likely manner of alternative splicing explains the divergence of the carboxyl termini of rat and human Ric-8B. To test the interactions of Ric-8A and Ric-8B with various Gα proteins in the two-hybrid system, the full-length rat Ric-8A and Ric-8B preys were individually co-transformed with wild type and GTPase-deficient (QL) Gα baits: Gαi1, Gαo, Gαq, Gαs long, and Gα13. Suspensions of these transformed yeast were spotted onto synthetic medium plates lacking tryptophan and leucine and tested for positive interactions between bait and prey using a β-galactosidase filter activity assay (24Hama H. Tall G.G. Horazdovsky B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15284-15291Google Scholar). The Ric-8A prey yielded a strong positive signal with Gαi1, Gαo, and Gαq and a weak signal with Gα13. No interaction was observed with Gαs long (Fig.2). The Ric-8A prey also showed a clear preference for interaction with the wild type Gαi1 bait compared with its GTPase-defective counterpart but did not show this preference for the other Gα baits tested. The Ric-8B prey showed a strong signal with Gαq and a weak signal with the Gαs long bait (Fig. 2). Much like the Ric-8A/Gαi1 interaction, the Ric-8B prey interacted preferentially with the wild type Gαs long bait. Intriguingly, the common two-hybrid interaction partner for these two mammalian Ric-8 homologs is Gαq, the Gα that was first shown to interact genetically with RIC-8 in C. elegans(20Miller K.G. Emerson M.D. McManus J.R. Rand J.B. Neuron. 2000; 27: 289-299Google Scholar). To investigate whether Ric-8A interacts directly with membrane-derived Gα proteins, a GST-full-length rat Ric-8A fusion protein was expressed and purified from baculovirus-infectedSf9 cells and used to bind G proteins present in a detergent extract of rat brain membranes. Three controls were used in this experiment: GST-Ric-8A incubated with glutathione Sepharose alone (Fig.3, lane 1), GST-Ric-8A incubated with rat brain membrane extract and glutathione Sepharose (Fig. 3, lane 2), and brain membrane extract incubated with glutathione Sepharose alone (Fig. 3, lane 3). Proteins adsorbed to Sepharose were released by incubation with Tev protease, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and either transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blotting with G protein subunit-specific antisera or stained with Coomassie Blue. Specific binding of a protein to Ric-8A was indicated when unique protein bands were found only in the experiments where GST-Ric-8A and extract were incubated together (Fig. 3,lane 2). These bands were isolated from the gels, trypsinized, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Unique protein bands of ∼40 kDa were identified as Gαo and a mixture of Gαi1, Gαi2, or Gαi3 (Hongjun Shu, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). The immunoblots shown in Fig. 3 confirmed the mass spectrometry and also revealed the presence of immunoreactive Gαq and Gα13. Neither Gαs nor G protein β subunits were detected (Fig. 3, lane 2). To understand the biochemical consequences of the interaction between Ric-8A and Gα proteins, we first determined whether association was dependent on the identity of the guanine nucleotide bound to Gα. Purified myristoylated Gαi1 was first incubated with GDP, GDP and AlF4−1, or GTPγS. These proteins were then further incubated with GST-Ric-8A and bound to glutathione Sepharose. The beads were extensively washed, and the bound proteins were eluted and resolved by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). GST-Ric-8A interacted preferentially with GDP-bound Gαi1(lanes 5 and 6), less well with Gαi1·GDP·AlF4−1 (lanes 3and 4), and not detectably with Gαi1·GTPγS (lanes 1 and 2). To further explore the identity of any guanine nucleotide associated with the complex of Gαi1 and Ric-8A, we gel-filtered Ric-8A·Gαi1 complexes prepared by incubation of Ric-8A with Gαi1 bound to radiolabeled GDP or GTPγS. The fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Bradford analysis and scintillation counting to quantify the amounts of complex, monomeric Ric-8A, monomeric Gαi1, and guanine nucleotide present in each fraction (Fig. 5). SDS-PAGE showed that Ric-8A forms a stable, apparently stoichiometric complex with Gαi1 that ha"

One potential mechanism for this is that Ser/Thr phosphorylation decreases the ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by the insulin receptor. An additional mechanism for modulating insulin signaling is via the down-regulation of IRS-1 protein levels. Insulin-induced degradation of IRS-1 has been well documented, both in cells as well as in patients with diabetes. Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 correlates with IRS-1 degradation, yet the details of how this occurs are still unknown. In the present study we have examined the potential role of different signaling cascades in the insulin-induced degradation of IRS-1. First, we found that inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin block the degradation. Second, knockout cells lacking one of the key effectors of this cascade, the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, were found to be deficient in the insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS-1. Conversely, overexpression of this enzyme potentiated insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation. Third, concurrent with the decrease in IRS-1 degradation, the inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin also blocked the insulin-stimulated increase in Ser312 phosphorylation. Most important, an IRS-1 mutant in which Ser312 was changed to alanine was found to be resistant to insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation. Finally, an inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, SP600125, at 10 μm did not block IRS-1 degradation and IRS-1 Ser312 phosphorylation yet completely blocked insulin-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation. Further, insulin-stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation was not blocked by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin, indicating that c-Jun N-terminal kinase is unlikely to be the kinase phosphorylating IRS-1 Ser312 in response to insulin. In summary, our results indicate that the insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS-1 via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway is in part dependent upon the Ser312 phosphorylation of IRS-1.

Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 serve as the major docking proteins for Src homology 2 domain containing proteins (5Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Google Scholar, 6White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Google Scholar). Association of the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase with tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1/2 results in the membrane localization and activation of the p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, leading to the generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate. These lipid products induce the activation of a number of signaling kinases including the Ser/Thr kinase Akt (7Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Genet.

However, other effects of insulin, for example its mitogenic actions, are mediated by association of Grb2 with tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc and IRS-1/2, which results in the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway (5Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Google Scholar, 6White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Google Scholar). In addition, other signal cascades stimulated by insulin may also participate in these responses (22Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M. Thurmond D.C. Mora S. Shigematsu S. Bickel P.E. Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. Nature. 2000; 407: 202-207Google Scholar). Some of the same signaling molecules that are involved in the metabolic and mitogenic actions of insulin have also been proposed to play a role in both the feedback inhibition of the insulin signal and cellular insulin resistance (23Birnbaum M.J.

It has been proposed that hyper-Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS proteins plays a key role in the uncoupling of the insulin signal. Hyperphosphorylation of IRS-1 on Ser/Thr residues has been shown in both cultured cells and in vivo to be associated with an insulin-resistant state (26Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A.

Densensitization of the insulin signal via IRS-1 Ser/Thr phosphorylation can result from counterregulatory hormone activation, proinflammatory cytokine production/cellular stress, or inhibition of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (26Hotamisligil G.S. Peraldi P. Budavari A. Ellis R. White M.F. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar, 28Li J. DeFea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9351-9356Google Scholar, 29Mothe I.

Several specific phosphorylation sites have been identified as targets of these counter regulatory hormones and their signaling cascades. Activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway has been shown to result in an increase in the phosphorylation of Ser616 of IRS-1 (32De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31400-31406Google Scholar,33De Fea K. Roth R.A.

Thus, Ser616 corresponds to rat Ser612 and Ser312 corresponds to rat Ser307. whereas activation of the JNK has been shown to result in the stimulation of Ser3122 phosphorylation of IRS-1 (34Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Google Scholar). Other Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites have also been identified in the IRS-1 molecule (35Ozes O.N. Akca H.

These include uncoupling of IRS proteins from cytoskeletal/membrane components, which causes translocation of IRS-1 to the cytosol (37Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J.

Science. 1996; 271: 665-668Google Scholar). An additional mechanism of modulating the insulin signal transduction pathway is via the degradation of key components in this cascade. Degradation of IRS-1 has been shown in a number of cell lines and primary cells treated with chronic insulin (40Rice K.M. Turnbow M.A. Garner C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, low IRS-1 protein levels are observed in animal models of insulin resistance and in adipocytes isolated from type 2 diabetic subjects but not type 1 diabetic subjects (48Carvalho E.

Smith U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4171-4175Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism of IRS-1 degradation has been the focus of numerous recent studies. Selective inhibitors of PI 3-kinase and mTOR have been shown in some, but not all, systems to inhibit insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation, consistent with the hypothesis that the degradation of IRS-1 is initiated via the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (41Berg C.E. Lavan B.E. Rondinone C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 1021-1027Google Scholar, 42Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Google Scholar, 43Hartley D.

However, because these inhibitors may have unknown additional effects, it is important to confirm these results by other approaches. Thus, an important finding was that expression of a constitutively active, membrane-targeted PI 3-kinase, p110CAAX, induces IRS-1 degradation and hyper-Ser/Thr phosphorylation (44Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 783-794Google Scholar, 46Takano A. Usui I. Haruta T. Kawahara J. Uno T. Iwata M. Kobayashi M. Mol.

These results therefore argue that the overexpression of the PI 3-kinase cascade leads to the degradation of IRS-1. However, no studies to date have reported on the ability of insulin to induce IRS-1 degradation in cells lacking the PI 3-kinase or other downstream components of this cascade. After activation of the PI 3-kinase cascade, IRS-1 appears to be degraded via the proteasome pathway. Evidence in favor of this model includes the finding that specific inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome block IRS-1 degradation but not Ser/Thr phosphorylation (42Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Google Scholar, 44Haruta T. Uno T. Kawahara J. Takano A. Egawa K. Sharma P.M. Olefsky J.M. Kobayashi M. Mol.

More recently, a temperature-sensitive mutant of ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 was shown to completely block insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation (47Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Google Scholar). In addition, several studies have reported that insulin stimulates the ubiquitination of IRS-1 (47Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Google Scholar,52Lee A.V. Gooch J.L. Oesterreich S. Guler R.L. Yee D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1489-1496Google Scholar). Ser/Thr phosphorylation of IRS-1 correlates with IRS-1 degradation, suggesting that the phosphorylation triggers the subsequent degradation. The identification of regulatory phosphorylation sites required for IRS-1 degradation and the kinase that phosphorylates these sites is critical to the further understanding of the mechanism of IRS-1 degradation. The present studies were designed to examine the role of phosphorylation at specific Ser residues in IRS-1 degradation and the kinase cascade responsible for initiating the degradation process. Because both human Ser312 phosphorylation and Ser616 phosphorylation correlate with desensitization, we have investigated whether phosphorylation at these sites can modulate IRS-1 degradation. We have found that inhibition of IRS-1 degradation by inhibitors of the PI 3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway correlates with inhibition of IRS-1 Ser312 phosphorylation. Moreover the insulin-stimulated degradation of a mutant IRS-1 in which Ser312 was replaced with Ala was decreased compared with the wt IRS-1. In contrast, a mutant IRS-1 in which Ser616was changed to Ala exhibited insulin-induced degradation comparable with the wt IRS-1. Insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation and Ser312 phosphorylation was partially blocked with a JNK small molecule inhibitor. However, subsequent studies showed that the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser312 was unlikely to be due to JNK because other inhibitors (like LY294002) could also block this phosphorylation without inhibiting JNK. These results indicate that phosphorylation at Ser312 is necessary for insulin-stimulated degradation and suggests that phosphorylation at Ser312 has a dual mechanism of modulating insulin action: uncoupling the interaction of IRS-1 with the insulin receptor as well as the targeting of IRS-1 to the degradation pathway.

C terminus epitope-tagged human IRS-1 was subcloned from pFastBac (53Greene M.W. Garofalo R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7082-7091Google Scholar) usingEcoRI, XbaI, and EcoRV restriction enzymes and ligated into EcoRI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1 (+) zeocin. Ser616 or Ser312 in human IRS-1 was mutated to Ala (S616A or S312A, respectively) with the QuikChange XL mutagenesis kit using the sense primer 5′-TACATGCCCATGGCCCCAGGGGTGG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCACCCCTGGGGCCATGGGCATGTA-3′ or sense primer 5′-CACGCACTGAGGCCATCACCGCC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GGCGGTGATGGCCTCAGTGCGTG-3′, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids and mutant sites were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing.

The vector pWZL blasticidine was prepared for ligation by digestion with XbaI, followed by treatment with Klenow to create blunt ends and then digestion with EcoRI and CIAP treatment. N-terminal Myc-tagged human PDK1 (54Alessi D.R. Deak M. Casamayor A. Caudwell F.B. Morrice N. Norman D.G. Gaffney P. Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Google Scholar) was subcloned into the vector pWZL hygromycin. H4IIErat hepatoma cells were infected with pWZL-expressing IRS-1 or PDK1 constructs as described (55Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, 85% confluent Phoenix packaging cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h post-transfection, fresh medium was added and allowed to incubate at 37 °C for 24 h to generate viral supernatant. 50–60% confluent H4IIE cells were incubated with viral supernatant for 24 h at 37 °C. Stable cell pools expressing IRS-1 were generated by selection for 48 h with 5 μg/ml blasticidine HCl and then maintained in 1 μg/ml blasticidine HCl. Stable cell pools expressing PDK1 were selected with 500 μg/ml hygromycin. H4IIE cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 5% newborn calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and then serum deprived for 10–18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The cells were pretreated with various inhibitors or Me2SO for 30 min prior to insulin stimulation. Insulin or 0.01 n HCl was added at the time of serum deprivation as described in the figure legends. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking PDK1 and control ES cells were cultured as previously described (56Balendran A. Hare G.R. Kieloch A. Williams M.R. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 217-223Google Scholar, 57Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Google Scholar). ES cells were serum deprived for 3 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm Hepes prior to insulin stimulation as described in the figure legends. H4IIE cells were lysed by shaking on ice for 20 min with 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNA3VO4, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 1× protease inhibitor set I mixture (Calbiochem). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein content was determined by the BCA assay. Approximately 20–30 and 200–300 μg of protein were used for analyses of total cell lysates and immunoprecipitations, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed with 30 μl of anti-FLAG agarose at 4 °C for 3 h. Immunoprecipitated IRS-1 proteins were washed with 20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100; then with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl; then with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl; and then with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaCl. Agarose beads were resuspended in 1× sample buffer (58 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 40% glycerol, and 0.1 m dithiothreitol). H4PDK1 and ES cells were lysed on ice with buffer B (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmbenzamidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 30 mmNaPPi, 1 mm NA3VO4, and 100 nm okadaic acid). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitations were performed with 2 μl of anti-IRS-1 antibody (ID6) at 4 °C for 3 h, followed by collection on protein G-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitated IRS-1 proteins were washed three times with buffer B. Sepharose beads were resuspended in 1× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 6%, 7.5%, or 10% Tris-glycine gels, then transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll). The membranes were incubated with various antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Following washing, incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000) for 1 h at room temperature, and washing, detection was carried out with enhanced chemiluminescent substrate. H4IIE cells in 6-well plates were lysed with 1× sample buffer. The samples were boiled for 5 min, and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. 30 μl were used for SDS-PAGE on 10% Tris-glycine gels and processed as described above. Chemiluminescent signals were directly quantitated using the Kodak 440CF Image Station and Kodak 1D version 3.5.3 software or by scanning densitometry and image analysis using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). The absolute integration value of the immunoreactive bands minus background was determined. The statistical significance was determined by Students t test (α = 0.05). Insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS-1 has been reported in a number of cellular models of insulin resistance (42Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Google Scholar, 46Takano A. Usui I. Haruta T. Kawahara J. Uno T. Iwata M. Kobayashi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5050-5062Google Scholar, 47Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J.

To determine whether IRS-1 protein levels are regulated by insulin in the highly responsive rat hepatomas H4IIE cells (59Andreone T.L. Beale E.G. Bar R.S. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 35-38Google Scholar), cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged wild type human IRS-1 (H4 wt IRS-1) were stimulated with various concentrations of insulin for 18 h. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibodies. A dose-dependent decrease in IRS-1 protein levels was detected with a 60 ± 4% decrease at 10 nm insulin (Fig.1 A). A control blot of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase in total cell lysates showed no decrease under the same conditions (Fig. 1 A). To confirm the role of intracellular proteolysis in this insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation, H4 wt IRS-1 cells were pretreated with or without MG132 and lactacystin, specific inhibitors of the 26 S proteasome. Consistent with other cellular models of insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation (42Pederson T.M. Kramer D.L. Rondinone C.M. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 24-31Google Scholar,46Takano A. Usui I. Haruta T.

Goldberg J.L. Qiao L.Y. Mitchell J.J. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1359-1364Google Scholar), MG132 and lactacystin completely blocked insulin-stimulated degradation (Fig. 1 B, lanes 5and 7 versus lane 3). The ability of MG132 alone to stimulate a shift in the molecular weight of the IRS-1 (Fig.1 B) indicates that it is likely activating the stress-activated kinases in these cells. The lack of an IRS-1 band in the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates from the parental H4IIE cells Fig.1 B, lane 1) verifies that the band being detected is the expressed human IRS-1. To investigate the signaling pathways mediating insulin-stimulated IRS-1 degradation in the H4IIE cells, H4 wt IRS-1 cells were pretreated with various inhibitors for 30 min and then stimulated with 10 nminsulin for 18 h. The cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to nitrocellulose and immunoblotting. In the absence of any inhibitor, a 60 ± 4% (n = 4) reduction in IRS-1 protein levels was detected with insulin stimulation. In the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, no IRS-1 degradation occurred (Fig. 2,A and C). Treatment of the H4 cells with this drug actually increased the IRS-1 levels, suggesting that even the basal turnover of IRS-1 was being inhibited. To determine whether downs"

Oxidative stress has been linked to tumor-associated neoangiogenesis; underlying mechanisms, however, remained poorly understood. Therefore, we studied the effect of oxidative stress on VEGF-A gene expression in gastric cancer cells. Oxidative stress generated by H2O2 application potently stimulated VEGF-A protein and mRNA levels as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real-time PCR techniques, respectively, and elevated the activity of a transfected (−2018) VEGF-Apromoter reporter gene construct in a time- and dose-dependent manner (4–8-fold). These effects were abolished by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, demonstrating specificity of oxidative stress responses. Functional 5′ deletion analysis mapped the oxidative stress response element of the human VEGF-A promoter to the sequence −88/−50, and a single copy of this element was sufficient to confer basal promoter activity as well as oxidative stress responsiveness to a heterologous promoter system. Combination of EMSA studies, Sp1/Sp3 overexpression experiments in Drosophila SL-2 cells, and systematic promoter mutagenesis identified enhanced Sp1 and Sp3 binding to two GC-boxes at −73/−66 and −58/−52 as the core mechanism of oxidative stress-triggered VEGF-A transactivation. Additionally, in Gal4-Sp1/-Sp3-Gal4-luciferase assays, oxidative stress increased Sp1 but not Sp3 transactivating capacity, indicating additional mechanism(s) of VEGF-A gene regulation.

Increased levels of ROS reflecting oxidative stress have been observed during a number of physiologic and pathologic states, comprising cellular differentiation, reperfusion injury, and ulcerative and inflammatory conditions (2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 239-247Google Scholar, 3Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 159-177Google Scholar). Oxidative stress is also believed to be a major pathogenic factor underlying development and progression of chronic disease states such as artherosclerosis, diabetes, and aging (2Finkel T.

Elevated levels of ROS can lead to DNA damage and apoptosis but also act as important signaling molecules influencing various cellular functions including gene expression (2Finkel T. Holbrook N.J.

The gastric mucosa is permanently exposed to luminal oxidants generated from ingested food, bacteria, and shed mucosal cells, and together with the surface mucous layer, the gastric epithelium represents the first line of defense against luminal oxidative alterations. Increased ROS levels have been linked to peptic lesions of the gastric mucosa triggered by ethanol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, stress, ischemia-reperfusion, and Helicobacter pylori infection (10Yoshikawa T. Naito Y. Kishi A. Kaneko T. Linuma H. Yasuda M. Takahashi S. Kondo M. Gut. 1993; 34: 732-737Google Scholar, 11Nishida K. Ohta Y. Kobayashi T. Ishiguro I.

In addition to these deleterious effects, ROS are also capable of influencing mucosal repair processes by stimulating epithelial proliferation, production, and release of mucosal growth factors as well as activation of proangiogenic pathways (13Jones M.K. Tomikawa M. Tarnawski A.S. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D303-D309Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have suggested that oxidative stress is also involved in gastric carcinogenesis (14Ernst P. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 13: 13-18Google Scholar, 15Correa P. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1995; 35: 59-64Google Scholar). Accordingly, epidemiological studies indicated that application of antioxidants can significantly reduce the risk of gastric cancer (15Correa P. Crit. Rev. Food Sci. Nutr. 1995; 35: 59-64Google Scholar) and lead to regression of gastric epithelial metaplasia (16Correa P. Fontham E.T.H. Bravo J.C. Ruiz B. Zarama G. Realpe J.L. Malcom G.T. Li D. Johnson W.D. Mera R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1881-1888Google Scholar), a lesion believed to reflect premalignant states of the gastric mucosa. Neoangiogenesis is a general pathophysiological mechanism critically involved in healing of inflammatory and ulcerative epithelial lesions as well as tumor growth and metastasis (17Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar). Among the proangiogenic factors identified so far, VEGF-A (vascularendothelial growth factorA) represents one of the most potent stimuli of neoangiogenesis (17Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 18Yancoupolus G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge W.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar). In the stomach, enhanced VEGF-Agene expression has been identified to critically contribute to peptic ulcer healing (13Jones M.K. Tomikawa M. Tarnawski A.S. Front.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 121: 1040-1047Google Scholar). In addition, gastric adenocarcinomas were found to frequently display high levels of VEGF-A expression accompanied by increased intratumoral microvessel density (22Takahashi Y. Cleary K.R. Mai M. Kitadai Y. Bucana C.D. Ellis L.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1679-1684Google Scholar, 23Chung K.H. Cancer. 1999; 86: 566-571Google Scholar), whereas injection of VEGF-A-specific neutralizing antibodies were capable of potently inhibiting the growth of gastric cancer xenotransplants in rodents (24Kanai T. Konno H. Tanaka T. Baba M. Matsumoto K. Yukita A. Asano M. Suzuki H. Baba S. Int. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 933-936Google Scholar). Despite the fact that these studies clearly established an important role of VEGF-A-dependent angiogenesis in mucosal regeneration, peptic ulcer healing, and gastric cancer, the pathways controlling VEGF-A gene expression in these settings have not yet been defined. Previous studies revealed that VEGF-A gene expression can be influenced by extracellular growth factors, cytokines, and genetic alterations or hypoxia (17Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 25Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Kieser A. Marmé D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 139-155Google Scholar). Moreover, current studies indicated that angiogenic processes may be influenced by cellular redox processes (26Cho M. Hunt T.K. Hussain M.Z. Am. J.

Med. 2002; 33: 1047-1060Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation of the VEGF-A promoter represents a core mechanism through which expression of the VEGF-A gene can be regulated (17Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar, 18Yancoupolus G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge W.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar, 25Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G. Kieser A. Marmé D. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 36: 139-155Google Scholar). Several cis-acting promoter elements including a hypoxia-responsive site at −975, proximal GC-rich elements, and Egr-1 and AP2 recognition motifs were found to participate in VEGF-A gene regulation (31Shi Q.

Depending on the cellular context and/or the stimulus investigated, these recognition motifs and/or their respective binding factors variably contribute to VEGF-A expression control (31Shi Q. Le X.

Moreover,VEGF-A gene expression has been shown to be regulated through several signaling cascades comprising MAP kinase ERK-, JNK-, and p38-dependent cascades as well as NF-κB pathways (17Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Google Scholar,18Yancoupolus G.D. Davis S. Gale N.W. Rudge W.S. Wiegand S.J. Holash J. Nature. 2000; 407: 242-248Google Scholar, 25Kolch W. Martiny-Baron G.

In contrast, signaling pathways mediating the effects of oxidative stress on the VEGF-A gene await clarification. Here we demonstrate that oxidative stress generated by the model oxidant H2O2 at submillimolar concentrations potently stimulates release and production of VEGF-A in gastric cancer cells and provides evidence that transcriptional activation of theVEGF-A promoter represents the underlying core mechanism. Moreover, we identify the zinc finger transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3 as molecular mediators of the VEGF-A redox response and show that Sp1/Sp3-activated GC-boxes located in the proximalVEGF-A promoter differentially participate in oxidative stress-dependent VEGF-A gene regulation. Furthermore, we show that MAPK ERK-related and to a lesser extent JNK-related signaling pathways are crucial for transmission of oxidative stress effects on the human VEGF-A gene in gastric cancer cells. AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany), and 10% bovine calf serum (Biochrom KG) in a humidified atmosphere (5% CO2, 95% air). Cultures of Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cell line 2 (SL-2) were maintained in Schneider's Drosophila medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 25 °C and atmospheric CO2. 2 × 104 AGS cells were plated in 24-well plates in growth medium overnight and then switched to serum-free UltraCulture® medium (BioWhittaker Inc., Walkersville, MD) containing 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Conditioned medium was collected after incubation with or without 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (Sigma) for various times. To determine cellular VEGF-A production, cultured cells were treated with lysis buffer containing 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm NaF, 2 μm leupeptin, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Protein concentrations were determined using the Protein Assay Kit® (Bio-Rad). VEGF-A concentrations were assessed using a commercial enzyme-linked immunoprecipitation assay (QuantikineTM; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's instructions, and normalized to protein content. To exclude cell damage after H2O2 treatment, lactate dehydrogenase activity in cellular supernatants was measured using the CytoTox96® nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Primers were designed using Primer Express software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Expression levels of humanVEGF-A and housekeeping gene β-actin were determined using the following primer pairs: forward VEGF-A(5′-cttgccttgctgctctacc-3′) and reverse VEGF-A(5′-cacacaggatggcttgaag-3′); forward β-actin (5′-tcagcaagcaggagtatgacga-3′) and reverse β-actin (5′-cgcaactaagtcatagtccgcc-3′). Specificity of the products was demonstrated for each fragment by melting curve analysis, gel electrophoresis, and sequencing. The SYBR Green I assay and the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) were used for detecting real-time quantitative PCR products from 0.25–2.5 ng of reverse-transcribed cDNA samples. SYBR Green I dye intercalation into the minor groove of double-stranded DNA reaches an emission maximum at 530 nm. PCRs for each sample were done in triplicate for both target gene and β-actin control. Quantitation of mRNA expression was carried out by relating the PCR threshold cycle obtained from tissue samples to a cDNA standard curve. In the case of β-actin, the PCR threshold cycle was related to the number of AGS cells from which β-actin was extracted. The normalized amount ofVEGF-A expression was obtained by dividing the averaged sample value by the averaged β-actin value of AGS cells and given in copies of VEGF-A per AGS cell. Transient transfections of cultured AGS cells were carried out using the calcium phosphate precipitation technique (DNA transfection kit; 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) as previously described (36Wessler S.

Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2802-2818Google Scholar). Briefly, AGS cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of reporter gene plasmid per well unless otherwise indicated. To correct for transfection efficiency, 50 ng/well of Renilla luciferase construct pRL-TK (Promega) were cotransfected. After transfection, cells were maintained in serum-free UltraCulture® (BioWhittaker) for 24 h. Unless otherwise indicated, cells were stimulated for 6 h with 500 μmhydrogen peroxide or 10−8m phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA). To block p38 MAP kinase, incubations were performed in the presence of 25 μm SB 202190 (Calbiochem). For transfection of SL-2 cells, 106 cells/well were transfected with 3 μg ofVEGF-A(−88/−50)-Luc along with 1 μg of expression constructs (Sp1, Sp3, Sp1-DBD, Sp3-DBD) or empty vectors. Luciferase activities were detected in a monolight Luminometer (EG Berthold, Bad Wildbach, Germany) using the “Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay” (Promega). Incubations were performed in triplicates, and results were normalized for transfection efficiency and calculated as means ± S.E. Values were expressed as arbitrary light units or -fold increases in luciferase activity compared with controls. Statistical significances were calculated using Student's t test (*,p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***,p < 0.001). VEGF-A5′-deletion luciferase constructs have previously been reported (33Finkenzeller G. Sparacio A. Technau A. Marme D. Siemeister G. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 669-676Google Scholar). To study VEGF-A regulatory elements in a heterologous promoter system, wild type and GC-box-mutatedVEGF-A(88/−50) oligonucleotides (TableI) were subcloned at HindIII (5′) and XhoI (3′) restriction sites into construct pT81-Luc (39Nordeen S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-456Google Scholar). Constructs were confirmed by restriction analysis and dideoxysequencing. Reporter plasmid Gal4-Luc, in which the luciferase gene is driven by a multimer of the Gal4 yeast transcription factor-binding element (40Thiel G. Kaufmann K. Magin A. Lietz M. Bach K. Cramer M.

Expression constructs encoding wild type Sp1 or Sp3 or corresponding mutants lacking their transactivation domain (pPACSp1-DBD and pPACSp3-DBD) have also been described (42Hagen G. Müller S.

Schäfer G. Fleming J. Rosewicz S. Wiedenmann B. Wang T.C. Höcker M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2802-2818Google Scholar). In brief, nuclear protein extracts (5 μg) were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP-radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides. DNA binding reactions were performed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 8.4), 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, 60 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm ZnCl2, and 10% glycerol for 30 min at 30 °C. For competition experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides. For supershift experiments, nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl of anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-Sp4, anti-AP2, and anti-Egr-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed in 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris, 50 mm borate, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. BioMax MR films (Amersham Biosciences) using an intensifying screen. For signaling studies, AGS cells were exposed to 1 mm H2O2, and whole cell lysates were prepared in 20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.42m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 mm K2HPO4, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1.25% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol as described (38Raychowdhury R. Schäfer G. Fleming J. Rosewicz S. Wiedenmann B. Wang T.C. Höcker M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2802-2818Google Scholar). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nylon membranes, Western blot analysis of proteins was performed as described (38Raychowdhury R. Schäfer G. Fleming J. Rosewicz S. Wiedenmann B. Wang T.C. Höcker M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2802-2818Google Scholar) using antibodies specifically recognizing phosphorylated ERK1/2, p38, JNK, or MEK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or corresponding nonphosphospecific antibodies to demonstrate equal protein loading. To determine the effects of oxidative stress on VEGF-A gene expression, AGS cells were exposed to H2O2 and analyzed for VEGF-A protein and mRNA levels. H2O2 time- and dose-dependently stimulated production and release of VEGF-A protein, having a maximum (∼3-fold elevation) at 12 h (Fig.1, A and B). These responses were redox-specific, as shown by their complete reversal through application of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. To investigate potential cell lysis due to H2O2treatment, lactate dehydrogenase activity in cell culture supernatants was analyzed in parallel (Fig. 1 C) and found to be unaltered (Fig. 1 C). Similar to the changes observed on the protein level, H2O2 treatment increasedVEGF-A mRNA levels (maximum at 8–12 h), suggesting that enhanced transcription represents the mechanism underlying oxidative stress responsiveness of the VEGF-A gene (Fig.1 D). To determine transactivating effects of oxidative stress on the VEGF-A gene, functional transfection studies usingVEGF-A luciferase reporter gene constructs were performed. H2O2 treatment of AGS cells potently stimulated the VEGF-A promoter in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal stimulation observed at 750 μmH2O2 (Fig.2 A). Analysis of time-response relationships demonstrated maximal VEGF-A transactivation after 4–8 h of H2O2 exposure (Fig.2 B), which corresponds well with the results obtained inVEGF-A mRNA studies (Fig. 1 D). To identify promoter regions mediating oxidative stress responsiveness of the human VEGF-A gene, functional 5′ deletion analysis was performed. These studies revealed that loss of the region spanning −2018 to −85 had no substantial influence on VEGF-A promoter activity. In contrast, removal of an additional 33 nucleotides abolished basal and H2O2-stimulated VEGF-A promoter activity (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that −85/−52 comprises essential regulatory elements. To investigate the enhancer properties of this promoter region in detail, it was transferred to a heterologous promoter system (pT81-Luc) and functionally analyzed (Fig. 3 B). The presence of the −88/−50 element conferred elevation of basal transcriptional activity (10–15-fold) as well as H2O2 responsiveness to the per se redox-insensitive pT81-Luc vector (Fig.3 B). Redox responses of VEGF-A −88/−50 were abolished by the antioxidant N-acteylcysteine (Fig.3 B). Analysis of the −88/−50 promoter region in EMSA studies showed that under basal and H2O2- stimulated conditions, two major complexes were bound to this element (Fig. 3 C) and that H2O2 treatment of AGS cells resulted in a parallel increase of complex I and II (Fig.3 C, lanes 3 and 4). Only infrequently we observed a third complex (complex III), which was not influenced by any oligonucleotides used in EMSA studies (data not shown) and therefore must be regarded as nonspecific. H2O2 treatment maximally enhanced complex I and II after 10 min, whereas prolonged exposure decreased complex formation (lanes 5–8). Under identical conditions, H2O2 did not increase the binding of CREB, USF-1, and USF-2 transcription factors to a minimal cox-2(cyclooxygenase 2) promoter fragment, 2M. Höcker, manuscript in preparation. demonstrating that oxidative stress-triggered protein/DNA interaction at theVEGF-A promoter is not a random nonspecific process. To further characterize the nuclear factors binding to the VEGF-A(−88/−50) element, EMSA competition studies were carried out (Fig. 4). The selection of consensus oligonucleotides used in these studies (Sp1, AP2, and Egr-1) was based on the presence of these sequences within the −88/−50 sequence. We found that complex I and II, which were found in unstimulated (Fig. 4 A, lanes 1–7) as well as stimulated samples (lanes 8–14) were completely competed out by an excess of Sp1 consensus sequence (lanes 2 and 9). In contrast, AP2 consensus sequence was clearly less effective (lanes 6 and 13), whereas Egr-1 consensus oligonucleotides had no effect (lanes 4 and11). To confirm these results, EMSA supershift experiments using specific antibodies recognizing Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, AP2, or Egr-1 were performed. These studies identified complex I as containing Sp1 protein (Fig. 4, B (lanes 3 and 8) and C (lanes 2, 5,6, and 8)), whereas complex II was shown to consist of Sp3 (Fig. 4 C, lanes 3,5, 7, and 8). In contrast, zinc finger protein Sp4 as well as AP2 and Egr-1 were not detected. In control EMSAs, the specificity of the AP2 antibody was confirmed using HeLa cell nuclear extracts together with a labeled AP2 consensus site as a probe (data not shown). Functionality of the Egr-1 antibody was confirmed in supershifts employing AGS nuclear extracts together with a proximal fragment of the mouse chromogranin A gene promoter as radiolabeled probe (38Raychowdhury R.

These noncompetitive inhibitors bind to the same site on the protein, ∼35 Å from the active site. The common features of binding include a large hydrophobic region and two hydrogen bonds between both oxygen atoms of a carboxylate group on the inhibitor and two main chain amide nitrogen atoms of Ser476 and Tyr477 on NS5B. The inhibitor-binding site lies at the base of the thumb domain, near its interface with the C-terminal extension of NS5B. The location of this inhibitor-binding site suggests that the binding of these inhibitors interferes with a conformational change essential for the activity of the polymerase.

HCV infection can develop into chronic hepatitis, which, in some cases, causes cirrhosis of the liver, eventually leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (1Rice C.M. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. 3rd Ed. Fields Virology. 1. Lippincott-Raven Press, Philadelphia, PA1996: 931-959Google Scholar). There is no vaccine against HCV currently, and no generally effective therapy for all genotypes of HCV is available. At the present time, the use of recombinant interferon α-2a, α-2b, “consensus” interferon, and pegylated interferon α-2b either in monotherapy or in combination with ribavirin is the only approved therapy available (2.Ronald, B. (2001)www.hivandhepatitis.com/hep_c/hep_c_treat.html.Google Scholar). However, limited efficacy and some adverse side effects are associated with these therapies (3Myles D.C. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2001; 4: 411-416Google Scholar). Therefore, the development of HCV-specific antiviral agents is needed urgently. Extensive studies have been done to understand the structures and functions of the individual components of the HCV-encoded polyprotein (structural proteins C, E1, and E2 and nonstructural proteins NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) (4Kato N.

The inhibitors of NS3 protease and, in some cases, corresponding structures of NS3 protease/inhibitor complexes have been reported recently (15Steinkuhler C. Koch U. Narjes F. Matassa V.G. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 919-932Google Scholar). In the case of HCV NS5B polymerase, both nucleoside and non-nucleoside inhibitors have been discovered in recent years (16Lesburg C.A. Radfar R. Weber P.C. Curr. Opin. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 1: 289-296Google Scholar). 3TC® (2′-deoxy-3′-thiacytidine proprietary compound lamivudine) triphosphate has been reported to have a weak inhibitory effect with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 180 μm (17Ishii K. Tanaka Y. Yap C.C. Aizaki H. Matsuura Y. Miyamura T. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 1227-1235Google Scholar), whereas numerous non-nucleoside compounds have been documented to possess relatively potent anti-NS5B activity. Examples include specific rhodanines and barbituric acid derivatives, many of which were found to exhibit anti-NS5B activity with IC50 values below 1 μm (18.Young, D. C., and Bailey, T. R. (March 2, 2000) World Intellectual Property Organization Patent WO-0010573.Google Scholar, 19.Bailey, T. R., and Young, D. C. (March 16, 2000) World Intellectual Property Organization Patent WO-0013708.Google Scholar). Classes of dihydroxypyrimidine carboxylic acids and diketoacid derivatives were claimed as well with IC50 values within the submicromolar range for the latter class (20.Gardelli, C., Giuliano, C., Harper, S., Koch, U., Narjes, F., Ontoria, J.

(2000) WO-0006529.Google Scholar). 2-Methylidenylbenzothiophene compounds were demonstrated to exert an in vitro anti-NS5B activity with IC50 values in the range of 0.2–30 μm (22.Young, D. C., and Bailey, T. R. (2000) WO-0018231.Google Scholar), whereas two series of pyrrolidine and benzimidazole analogues were described as novel anti-NS5B inhibitors with the latter class having a range of IC50 values from <1 to 25 μm (23.Dhanak, D., and Carr, T. (2001) WO-0185720.Google Scholar, 24.Beaulieu, P. L., Fazal, G., Gillard, J., Kukolj, G., and Austel, V. (2002) WO-0204425.Google Scholar, 25.Yoshida, A., Mizutani, K., and Hashimoto, H. (2001) WO-0147883.Google Scholar). However, no structure of an NS5B polymerase/inhibitor complex is available in the literature. In terms of compounds demonstrating effectiveness in surrogate cell-based assays for HCV replication, numerous nucleoside derivatives have been reported to inhibit self-replicating subgenomic HCV RNAs in the human hepatoma cell line (26.Devos, R., Dymock, B.

In this work, we present the three-dimensional structures of two HCV NS5B polymerase/inhibitor complexes. These inhibitors were synthesized as part of structure-activity relationship optimization (SAR) program and are phenylalanine derivatives compound A((2s)-2-[(2,4-dichloro-benzoyl)-(3-trifluoromethyl-benzyl)-amino]-3-phenyl-propionic acid) and compound B((2s)-2-[(5-Benzofuran-2-yl-thiophen-2-ylmethyl)-(2,4-dichloro-benzoyl)-amino]-3-phenyl-propionic acid) (see Fig.1 a). 2Chan, L., Reddy, T.

Both occupy a common binding site in the thumb subdomain near to the C terminus of NS5B polymerase. The detailed interactions between NS5B and inhibitors, revealed by crystallographic studies, provide a starting point to improve currently known inhibitors and to design new inhibitors. Moreover, the structural information also suggests a possible inhibition mechanism, which would shed light on the enzymology of the NS5B polymerase itself. For crystallographic studies, a recombinant soluble form representing a 21-amino acid C-terminally truncated HCV NS5B genotype 1b strain BK enzyme containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Purification was done as described by Lesburg et al. (14Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar) and Ferrari et al. (27Ferrari E. Wright-Minogue J. Fang J.W. Baroudy B.M. Lau J.Y. Hong Z. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1649-1654Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, the initial step consisted of loading soluble bacterial lysates onto a HiTrap nickel chelating affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). The bound enzyme was eluted using an imidazole gradient. Imidazole was then removed from the buffer of the pooled active fractions using PD-10 desalting columns (Amersham Biosciences). Further purification was achieved by loading the protein preparation onto a cation exchange HiTrap SP-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) using a NaCl gradient for elution. Thereafter, buffer was changed to 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 600 mm NaCl using a PD-10 column. The NS5B enzyme was precipitated with ammonium sulfate at 50% saturation and conserved at 4 °C until use. For enzyme kinetic study purposes, a full-length version of the enzyme expressed from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells was purified following the procedure of Alaoui-Ismaili et al.(28Alaoui-Ismaili M.H. Hamel M. L'Heureux L. Nicolas O. Bilimoria D. Labonte P. Mounir S. Rando R.F. J. Hum. Virol. 2000; 3: 306-316Google Scholar). Measurement of the inhibitory effect of compounds on HCV NS5B polymerization activity was performed by evaluating the amount of radiolabeled UTP incorporated by the enzyme in a newly synthesized RNA using a homopolymeric RNA template/primer. Essentially, the compounds were tested at a variety of concentrations (0.75–3.75 μm) in a final volume of 50 μl of reaction mixture consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 400 ng of purified NS5B enzyme, 500 ng of poly(rA)/oligo(dT)15 (Invitrogen), various concentrations (7.5–60 μm) of nonradioactive UTP, and 0.3–2.5 μCi of α-32P-labeled UTP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). RNA-dependent RNA polymerase reactions were allowed to proceed for 15, 30, and 45 min at 22 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA. Thereafter, a volume of 50 μl (25 μg) of sonicated salmon sperm DNA and 100 μl of a solution of 20% trichloroacetic acid, 0.5% tetrasodium pyrophosphate at 4 °C were added to the mixture followed by an incubation on ice for 30 min to ensure complete precipitation of nucleic acids. The samples were then transferred onto 96-well MultiScreen filter plates (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The filter plates were washed with 600 μl of 1% trichloroacetic acid, 0.1% tetrasodium pyrophosphate/well and dried 20 min at 37 °C. A 50-μl volume of liquid scintillation mixture (Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland) was added, and the incorporated radioactivity was quantified using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallac MicroΒeta Trilux; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The K i values were calculated using the computer software GraphPad Prizm (version 2.0, GraphPad Software Inc.). The reported crystallization conditions were adopted with some modifications (14Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar). HCV NS5B ΔC21 protein (20 mg/ml) in 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol was crystallized by the hanging drop method. Three μl each of protein solution and precipitant solution (18% (w/v) PEG 4000, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) were mixed on a coverslip and then equilibrated over a 1-ml reservoir of the precipitant solution. Seeding was used to improve the quality of crystals. Crystals adopt an orthorhombic lattice (space groupP212121) with unit cell parameters a = ∼86 Å, b = ∼105 Å, and c = ∼126 Å, which is consistent with published results (14Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar). The protein/inhibitor complexes were prepared by soaking the crystals in the inhibitor solutions. The soaking solution contains 5 mm inhibitor, 20% (w/v) PEG 4000, 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmmercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5. The cryo-protectant solution has a similar composition as the soaking buffer with 30% (v/v) glycerol added as cryo-protectant instead of 5 mm inhibitor. Diffraction data were collected at 105 K using an R-AXIS IV++ image plate detector with copper Kα radiation generated by a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode x-ray generator. Indexing and integration of the raw image plate data were carried out with DENZO, and the data were merged and reduced with SCALEPACK (29Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). The data were complete to 2.0 and 2.9 Å resolution for complexes NS5B/A and NS5B/B, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The correct orientation and position of NS5B in the unit cell were determined by molecular replacement methods with the CNS package (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar) using 1C2P as an initial model. The inhibitors were located unambiguously in ςA-weighted ‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ and 2‖Fo‖ − ‖Fc‖ electron density maps. Refinement of coordinates and atomic temperature factors was carried out using the CNS package and a maximum likelihood target. Bulk solvent corrections and anisotropic B-factor scaling were also applied in the refinement. Model rebuilding was performed using XtalView (31McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Google Scholar). Model geometry was checked using PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.J. Macarthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar). Solvent molecules were added into the model for the NS5B/A complex. No attempt was made to include solvent for the NS5B/B complex because of the lower resolution limit (2.9 Å). The main refinement statistics are listed in Table I. The refined atomic coordinates and B-factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession codes 1NHU and 1NHVfor the complexes NS5B/A and NS5B/B, respectively). Both compounds A and B were found to inhibit NS5B polymerization activity in a dose-dependent manner. In an assay using poly(rA)/oligo(dT)15 as a homopolymeric template/primer, both compounds were found to act as noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to the UTP substrate, with a commonK i value of 2.2 μm (Fig.1 b). As in other nucleic acid polymerases, the domain arrangement of NS5B can be described in terms of the fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains of a right hand (Fig.2 a) (33Steitz T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17395-17398Google Scholar). One of the unique features of the HCV NS5B structure is that two loops of the fingers subdomain extend to pack against the thumb subdomain, which, together with the palm subdomain, encircles the polymerase active site (14Lesburg C.A. Cable M.B. Ferrari E. Hong Z. Mannarino A.F. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 937-943Google Scholar). The NS5B polymerase active site is located in the palm subdomain, as seen in all known polymerases. Two conserved aspartic acid residues (Asp220 and Asp318 for HCV NS5B) in the active site coordinate two Mg2+ ions during the polymerization reaction. The non-nucleoside inhibitors of the present study are bound in a wedge-like fashion to a hydrophobic binding pocket located near the second last helix in the C-terminal region of the thumb subdomain (Fig. 2, a and b). This inhibitor-binding site is ∼35 Å away from the polymerase active site. The omit electron density maps (Fig. 3) clearly reveal the orientation and conformation of regions I, II, and III of both inhibitors (Fig. 1 a). Region IV of both inhibitors is poorly defined in the omit map, indicating the presence of multiple conformations for that part of the inhibitor.Figure 3Stereo views of simulated annealed omit ‖F obs‖ − ‖F calc‖ electron density maps contoured at 3ς level for inhibitor A complex (a) and inhibitor B complex (b).The maps were calculated to 2.0 and 2.9 Å resolution for Aand B, respectively.

The main chain atoms of Trp528 have been omitted for clarity. The figures were generated using BobScript (47Esnouf R.M. J. Mol. Graph.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The inhibitor-binding site consists of two hydrophobic pockets and a pair of adjacent main chain amide groups. The primary binding pocket makes predominantly hydrophobic interactions with the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group (region I, Fig. 1 a) of both inhibitors. The bottom of the pocket is formed by the side chain of Arg422, and the surrounding walls of the pocket are formed by the side chains of Trp528, Met423, Leu419, and Tyr477 and the main chain atoms of His475 and Leu474 (Fig. 2, b andc). This pocket exists in the native HCV NS5B structure and has the appropriate size to accommodate a phenyl group and its substituents. Adjacent to the primary binding pocket are two main chain amide nitrogen groups (Ser476 and Tyr477) that form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl group (region II, Fig.1 a) of both inhibitors. These two binding features form the key components of the inhibitor-binding site. In addition, there is a second hydrophobic surface-binding pocket that accommodates the phenyl ring of region III (Fig. 1 a). Region IV of the inhibitors makes only a few minor contacts with the enzyme. Both inhibitors bind to the enzyme at the same binding site and in the same manner as expected on the basis of their similar chemical structures. The following discussion will focus on the NS5B/compound Acomplex, because its structure was refined to higher resolution. Both inhibitors make a series of hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, and van der Waals interactions with a shallow binding pocket on HCV NS5B, as shown schematically for compound A in Fig. 2 d. One of the most significant interactions is a pair of hydrogen bonds that are formed between the carboxyl group on the inhibitors and the main chain peptide nitrogen atoms of residues Ser476 and Tyr477. The three atoms of the carboxyl group and the two main chain nitrogen atoms roughly define a plane. The 2,4-dichlorophenyl group (region I) of each inhibitor has extensive favorable interactions with seven residues. Extensive van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions are made with the side chains of Leu419, Met423, Tyr477, and Trp528, as well as the Cα and Cβ atoms of His475. In addition, the positively charged guanidinium group of Arg422 forms favorable electrostatic interactions with the electronegative 4-chlorine atom of the dichlorophenyl group, and the electronegative carbonyl oxygen atom of Leu474 forms a short 3.6 Å contact with the positively charged edge of the aromatic ring. Hydrophobic contacts of 3.9 to 4.2 Å exist between the phenyl ring (region III) of the inhibitor and the side chain of Leu497. The Cδ atom of Ile482 makes a contact with the carboxylate group of the inhibitor with a distance of 4.2 Å. Although the side chain of Ile482 has the correct orientation to interact with the phenyl ring (region III) of the inhibitor, the closest approach is only 4.7 Å. The 3-trifluoromethylphenyl group (region IV) of compound A is located above the protein surface, with contact distances of 3.2 to 4.2 Å to Arg501. Region IV is not well defined in the electron density map. The inhibitor-binding site forms a basic patch in the region of the thumb subdomain (Fig. 4). Electrostatic interactions between the positively charged protein surface and the negatively charged inhibitor likely further enhance binding. The enzyme undergoes only minor conformational changes upon inhibitor binding, as shown when the inhibitor-bound complex structure is superimposed on the HCV NS5B native structure (Fig. 2 c). The 2-chlorine atom of the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group of the inhibitor flips the Sδ and Cε of the Met423side chain away from the primary binding pocket. There are multiple conformations of the Met423 side chain observed in NS5B native structure (1C2P). The side chain of Arg501 is pushed away by the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group of inhibitor. The guanidinium group of the side chain of Arg501 is not well defined in the electron density map, which may indicate the mobile nature of this residue. No clear main chain movement in NS5B is observed (The r.m.s. deviation between 557 Cα atoms (NS5B/compound A complexversus NS5B native (1C2P)) is 0.3 Å.). In addition to the chemical, hydrophobic, and physical interactions, shape recognition plays an important role in facilitating the specificity of protein/inhibitor binding as well (Fig. 4). For both inhibitors, the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group (region I) occupies the primary binding pocket of NS5B. Region I is connected to the carboxyl group (region II) of both inhibitors by a cis-amide group. The carboxylate group in turn forms two hydrogen bonds with main chain nitrogen atoms of Ser476 and Tyr477. This is the main topological feature of both inhibitors. Inspection of the binding site also reveals that region IV of inhibitors (trifluoromethylphenyl group of A and the thiophene moiety of B) is basically floating above the protein surface without any strong interactions to the protein except to Arg501. This results from the multiple rotamers of region IV of both inhibitors and explains the poorly defined electron density around that area. The interaction between region III of inhibitors and NS5B is also not optimal, suggesting that further chemical optimization efforts should be focused on region III. As indicated above, region IV of the inhibitors does not appear to contribute significantly to the binding, but its presence may be required to position the other regions in the proper conformation. Overall, regions I and II of the inhibitors are the key to NS5B/inhibitor recognition. The amide bridge connecting regions I and II has a cis-conformation in the observed binding state. The trans-isomer would not be expected to bind to the NS5B polymerase efficiently. The C–N bond of an amide group cannot rotate freely, which imposes some constraints on the stereochemistry of the inhibitor. Although this constraint may hinder the adoption of the preferred conformation of the inhibitor, it may also predispose a conformation that is roughly optimal prior to interaction with the protein. In our search for better inhibitors, it is therefore a worthwhile endeavor to design molecules that can adopt a conformation similar to the one depicted above and to characterize the structures of the new complexes. The hydrophobic pocket targeted by the inhibitors reported in the current study is highly conserved in all genotypes of HCV (Fig. 2 e). Residues Leu419 and Ile482 are replaced by Ile and Leu, respectively, in some serotypes, which is a conservative substitution that is not expected to interfere with the hydrophobic interactions between protein and inhibitor. In HCV serotype 5a, residue 423 is Ile instead Met, which is present in all other serotypes. This is also a conservative substitution that may even favor hydrophobic interactions between this residue and the dichlorophenyl group of inhibitor. Residue Leu497 is conserved in all serotypes except for type 6a, where Ser is found instead. In this case, the interaction between inhibitor and protein may be decreased slightly, but this residue is located in the surface binding pocket where hydrophobic interactions may not be so critical. Exchange of Arg and Lys at residue 501 is not expected to have a significant impact because of the similar electrostatic properties and structure of these two residues. Although residue 476 is not well conserved across all serotype families, it should not be a problem for inhibitor binding because it is the backbone nitrogen of residue 476 that interacts with the inhibitor. Therefore, it is expected that both inhibitors will bind to the polymerases of all genotypes on the basis of our structural analysis. The high degree of conservation in these surface binding pockets also indicates that these residues are important for normal enzyme function. Because the inhibitors reported in this study bind remotely from the polymerase active site (∼35 Å) and act kinetically in a noncompetitive manner with respect to the UTP substrate, they must exert an indirect mode of inhibition. Non-nucleoside inhibitors of other polymerases have previously been observed to bind remotely from the active site (34Sarafianos S.G. Das K. Ding J. Boyer P.L. Hughes S.H. Arnold E. Chem. Biol. 1999; 6: R137-R146Google Scholar). Most notably, a large class of therapeutically efficacious HIV-1 reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors bind in a hydrophobic pocket ∼10 Å from the active site. The binding of an inhibitor in this pocket on the reverse transcriptase appears to stabilize an open, inactive conformation of the polymerase. This open conformation is unable to chelate divalent metal ions at the active site and is hence unable to catalyze the phosphoryl transferase reaction. In the uninhibited enzyme, this hydrophobic pocket closes when the reverse transcriptase adopts the closed conformation capable of catalyzing the phosphoryl transferase reaction. The HCV polymerase inhibitors reported in the present study may exert an indirect mode of inhibition analogous to that previously documented for HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. Both of the HCV polymerase inhibitors bind to a conformation of the HCV polymerase that is similar to the open, inactive conformation observed in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and other polymerases (35Doublie S. Sawaya M.R. Ellenberger T. Structure. 1999; 7: R31-R35Google Scholar). In this conformation, the active site aspartic acid residues that normally coordinate to two divalent metal ions are too far apart to coordinate to metal ions. Both HCV inhibitors also bind to a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of the thumb domain and form intimate hydrogen bonding interactions with main chain amide nitrogen atoms at residues Ser476 and Tyr477 of the thumb domain. Although the structure of the closed, active conformation of HCV polymerase has yet to be determined, it is possible that the hydrophobic inhibitor-binding pocket may close and change orientation relative to residues Ser476 and Tyr477, because the thumb reorients to produce the closed, active conformation of the enzyme. If this is the case, then the binding of inhibitors to this pocket may prevent the polymerase from undergoing a conformational change essential for enzymatic activity. An eight-degree rotation of the thumb domain relative to the palm and thumb domains has recently been observed in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (36Ng K.K. Cherney M.M. Lopez Vazquez A. Machin A. Alonso J.M. Parra F. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1381-1387Google Scholar). In the “open” conformation, the thumb domain and the portion of the palm domain against which it packs is rotated away from the active site, leaving the active site in an inactive state unable to bind to divalent metal cations, nucleoside triphosphates, and RNA. In the “closed” conformation, the thumb domain and an adjacent strand of the palm domain rotate toward the active site, resulting in an active conformation that is able to catalyze the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. Because the HCV polymerase has a very similar arrangement of palm and thumb domains to that of the polymerase from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, it is possible that an analogous series of conformational changes occurs in the HCV enzyme. If this is the case, then the binding of inhibitors stabilizing the open conformation will likely prevent the enzyme from adopting an active, closed conformation. The noncompetitive inhibitors of our study may also be inhibiting HCV polymerase by interfering with the binding of the allosteric activator riboguanosine triphosphate (rGTP). High concentrations of rGTP stimulate RNA synthesis by enhancing the initiation step (37Lohmann V. Overton H. Bartenschlager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10807-10815Google Scholar, 38Luo G. Hamatake R.K. Mathis D.M. Racela J. Rigat K.L. Lemm J. Colonno R.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 851-863Google Scholar). Recent high resolution crystal structures of HCV polymerase bound to metal ions and rGTP show that the allosteric binding site of rGTP is located about 30 Å from the active site at the interface between the extension of the fingers and the thumb (39Bressanelli S. Tomei L. Rey F.A. De Francesco R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3482-3492Google Scholar). Remarkably, this allosteric binding site is only 15 Å from the binding site of our inhibitors. Because there are no common residues to both binding sites, it does not appear that our inhibitors compete for the same binding site, which is also in agreement with our NMR-based competition experiment. 3C. G. Yannopoulos, P. Xu, F. Ni, and R. C. Bethell, unpublished data. However, the proximity of the two binding sites suggests that our inhibitors may exert a second mode of inhibition by interfering with the allosteric effect exerted by the binding of rGTP. The oligomerization of several enzymes has been reported among the nucleic acid polymerase family with the palm, fingers, and thumb substructure. In the case of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, it has been suggested that the oligomer of poliovirus 3D polymerase is crucial for catalytic activity (40Pata J.D. Schultz S.C. Kirkegaard K. RNA. 1995; 1: 466-477Google Scholar, 41Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1153-1163Google Scholar). Similar behavior for HCV NS5B polymerase has also been reported recently (42Qin W. Luo H. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Yamashita T. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2132-2137Google Scholar, 43Wang Q.M. Hockman M.A. Staschke K. Johnson R.B. Case K.A. Lu J. Parsons S. Zhang F. Rathnachalam R. Kirkegaard K. Colacino J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3865-3872Google Scholar). Therefore, these polymerases may catalyze RNA synthesis in a cooperative manner. Although the structural details of polymerase oligomers have not been elucidated clearly yet, some interactions between polymerase molecules, in certain crystal forms of these enzymes, have been proposed to be responsible for cooperative RNA binding and polymerization activity. For poliovirus 3D polymerase, two interfaces (I and II) have been described (44Hansen J.L. Long A.M. Schultz S.C. Structure. 1997; 5: 1109-1122Google Scholar). Interface I involves extensive interactions between the front of the thumb domain and the back of the palm domain. This interface is important for RNA binding based on mutagenesis studies (41Hobson S.D. Rosenblum E.S. Richards O.C. Richmond K. Kirkegaard K. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1153-1163Google Scholar). Two interfaces (A and B) are observed for HCV NS5B polymerase as well (43Wang Q.M. Hockman M.A. Staschke K. Johnson R.B. Case K.A. Lu J. Parsons S. Zhang F. Rathnachalam R. Kirkegaard K. Colacino J.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3865-3872Google Scholar). Interface A contains extensive interactions between the fingers domain and thumb domain, specifically in the region of the last two helices and the C-terminal extension, which is adjacent to our inhibitor-binding site. Thus, there is also the possibility that the non-nucleoside inhibitors reported in this study may inhibit polymerase activity by disturbing the oligomerization of the NS5B polymerase.

Interleukin-6 (IL6)-deficient mice show a lack in DNA synthesis after partial hepatectomy (PH). To define better the role of IL6 and its family members for liver regeneration after PH, we used conditional knockout mice for glycoprotein 130 (gp130), the common signal transducer of all IL6 family members. We show that gp130-dependent pathways control Stat3 activation after PH. By using gene array analysis, we demonstrate that c-jun, NF-κB, c-myc, and tumor necrosis factor receptor expression is gp130-dependent. However, in gp130-deleted mice only minor effects on cell cycle and on the maximum of DNA synthesis after PH were found compared with controls. As in conditional gp130 animals, the acute phase response was completely abolished, we considered that other means are essential to define the role of gp130-dependent pathways for liver regeneration. LPS stimulation in gp130-deleted and also IL6 −/− animals after PH leads to a significant reduction in survival and DNA synthesis, which was associated with decreased Bcl-xL expression and higher apoptosis in the liver. These results indicate that the phenotype concerning the reduction in DNA synthesis might be linked to the degree of infection after PH. Thus our results suggest that the role of gp130-dependent signaling is not a direct influence on cell cycle progression after partial hepatectomy but is to activate protective pathways important to enable hepatocyte proliferation.

Because all known IL6 family members use gp130 for signal transduction, mice lacking functional gp130 are an attractive model to study the role of IL6-related pathways in vivo. gp130 knockout mice die in uteri or directly after birth due to myocardial hypoplasia and reduced hemopoiesis in the fetal liver (4Yoshida K. Taga T. Saito M. Suematsu S. Kumanogoh A. Tanaka T. Fujiwara H. Hirata M. Yamagami T. Nakahata T. Hirabayashi T. Yoneda Y. Tanaka K. Wang W.Z. Mori C. Shiota K. Yoshida N. Kishimoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 407-411Google Scholar,5Kawasaki K. Gao Y.H. Yokose S. Kaji Y. Nakamura T. Suda T. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Kataoka H. Yuasa T. Norimatsu H. Yamaguchi A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4959-4965Google Scholar). In order to circumvent this problem, conditional gp130 knockout mice using the Cre/loxP system were generated (6Betz U.A. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Muller W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Google Scholar). In these mice exon 16 coding for the gp130 transmembrane domain can be deleted as two loxP sites flank it. In animals with the Cre recombinase under the control of the Mx promoter, expression is induced by interferon-α or agents triggering internal interferon-α expression, e.g. pIpC (6Betz U.A. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Muller W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Google Scholar,7Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Google Scholar). In the liver, IL6 is a major regulator of the acute phase response. It has also been shown that IL6 is essential for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) (8Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M. Rose-John S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1854-1862Google Scholar, 9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). First experiments indicated that there is an elevation of TNFα followed by IL6 in the serum of animals after PH (8Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M. Rose-John S. Manns M.P. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 1854-1862Google Scholar). Further studies using IL6 and TNF receptor 1 (TNF-R1) knockout mice (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar, 10Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Google Scholar) demonstrated that in both knockout animals S phase progression is impaired and some of the animals die after surgery. In both IL6 and TNF-R1 knockout mice, the defect in hepatocyte proliferation can be rescued by treating the animals with IL6. These results imply that the increase in TNFα levels is important to induce IL6, which is ultimately involved in triggering liver regeneration (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar,11Streetz K.L. Luedde T. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Gut. 2000; 47: 309-312Google Scholar). However, other reports indicated the possibility that the role of IL6 on cell cycle progression during liver regeneration after PH is less essential as hypothesized previously (12Sakamoto T. Liu Z. Murase N. Ezure T. Yokomuro S. Poli V. Demetris A.J. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 403-411Google Scholar). These results suggest the possibility that other factors, e.g. the expression of other IL6 family members, may modulate the outcome after PH and raise the question of the ultimate role of IL6 during liver regeneration. In order to circumvent a possible redundancy of different IL6 family members, we used conditional gp130 knockout mice to study liver regeneration after PH. By using this approach, we define more precisely the role of IL6/gp130-dependent signaling, and we show that these pathways may determine survival after PH but not the expression of genes directly involved in cell cycle control. gp130 loxP (+/+) Mx-Cre(−) mice were bred with gp130 loxP (+/+) Mx-Cre(+) animals. By using this approach, littermates were always homozygote for gp130 loxP and had a 50% chance for the Mx-Cre transgene. These animals with identical backgrounds were then used for further experiments. Cre+ and Cre− (controls) animals were always treated in parallel with pIpC (Sigma) as indicated. 30 μg of isolated genomic DNA derived from mouse livers was digested with EcoRI overnight, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond N+ membranes. Membranes were hybridized with a 32P-labeled gp130 probe as described before (6Betz U.A. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Muller W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Google Scholar). The deletion efficiency in other organs has already been described (6Betz U.A. Bloch W. van den Broek M. Yoshida K. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Addicks K. Rajewsky K. Muller W. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1955-1965Google Scholar). Two IL6 knockout strains and respective controls were used in this analysis (13Weinhold B. Ruther U. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 425-429Google Scholar, 14Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Google Scholar). The IL6 −/− strain was a gift of Uli Rüther (University of Düsseldorf, Germany) and was back-crossed to a U. S. Naval Medical Research Institute background. The second IL6 −/− strain (C57BL/6) (13Weinhold B. Ruther U. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 425-429Google Scholar) was received from Benhard Schieffer (Department of Cardiology and Angiology, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany). Gp130 loxP/Mx-Cre-positive (+) and -negative (−) animals were stimulated with 80 μg of pIpC. At different days after stimulation these animals were treated with 10 μg of IL6 per mouse. 3 h after IL6 injection, the liver was harvested, and liver nuclear extracts were prepared as described before (15Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Malek N.P. Plumpe J. Tiegs G. Manns M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1960-1969Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the OptEIA mouse IL6 kit (Pharmingen) measured IL6 serum levels. 6–8-Week-old male gp130 loxP/Mx-Cre + and − (controls) animals were treated with 80 μg of pIpC per mouse. 10 days after stimulation and 12 h before surgery, food was withdrawn from the animals. Two-thirds (partial) hepatectomy was performed as described earlier (16Wüstefeld T. Rakemann T. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 514-522Google Scholar). The removed median, right, and caudate liver lobes were routinely tested for the efficiency of exon 16 deletion by Southern blot analysis. In all mice the efficiency in the liver was >95%. For LPS stimulation experiments 30 μg of LPS/20 g mouse (Sigma) was injected intraperitoneally 3 h after partial hepatectomy. For each time point indicated at least 4 mice were used in parallel. Blood was drawn from the animals at each time point. The remaining livers were removed, pooled, and rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and part of the livers were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen or tissue-tek (Sakura Europe, Netherlands). The remaining liver was used to prepare nuclear extracts (15Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Malek N.P. Plumpe J. Tiegs G. Manns M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1960-1969Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) as described previously (15Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Malek N.P. Plumpe J. Tiegs G. Manns M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1960-1969Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis was performed. Membranes were probed with anti-cyclin E and anti-cyclin A as primary antibodies (SC-481, SC-751; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). As a secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, number 711-035-152) was used. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the ECL detection system as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot analysis was performed for each protein of interest derived least at three times from different animals. Gel shift experiments (EMSA) were performed as described previously (15Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Malek N.P. Plumpe J. Tiegs G. Manns M.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1960-1969Google Scholar). Liver nuclear extracts were incubated with a 32P-labeled consensus Stat3 (5′-GTG CAT TTC CCG TAA ATC TTG TCT ACA-3′) site, AP-1 site (5′-CGC TTG ATG ACT CAG CAG CCG GAA-3′), and NF-κB site (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG G-3′) in 1× binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 34 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). 3.5 μg of liver nuclear extracts was incubated for 30 min on ice. Free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were resolved on a 4% TBE-polyacrylamide gel. Supershift experiments were performed using anti-Stat1 and anti-Stat3 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For in vivo pulse-labeling experiments, 5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd, Amersham Biosciences), 30 μg/g mice, was injected intraperitoneally 2 h before killing. Liver tissue was frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. 5-μm cryosections were fixed in ice-cold acetone/methanol and stained according to the cell proliferation kit manual (Amersham Biosciences). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously, according to standard procedures (17Lüdde T. Kubicka S. Plumpe J. Liedtke C. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5264-5278Google Scholar). The serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, hemopexin, albumin, c-myc, and β-actin (GAPDH) cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]CTP according to the instructions for Rediprime (Amersham Biosciences). The hybridization procedure was performed as described previously (17Lüdde T. Kubicka S. Plumpe J. Liedtke C. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5264-5278Google Scholar). Blots were exposed for autoradiography and exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji) for quantification. The specific signals were normalized to the β-actin signals and set to 1 for untreated animals. For sample preparation for cDNA expression arrays, three livers from each group were homogenized in RNA Clean Solution (HYPAID-AGS) for isolation and purification of total RNA. The RNA was pooled and treated with DNase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA), and the quality of 10 μg of RNA was evaluated by denaturing MOPS gel electrophoresis. The cDNA probes prepared from DNase-treated RNAs obtained from each of the experimental groups were hybridized simultaneously to four membranes containing Atlas mouse cDNA expression arrays (Clontech). 5 μg of DNase-treated RNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and reverse-transcribed to cDNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol. The radioactively labeled cDNA probes were hybridized overnight to cDNA expression arrays using ExpressHyb hybridization solution with continuous agitation at 68 °C. After two high stringency washes, the hybridized membranes were exposed to a PhosphorImaging screen overnight. The PhosphorImaging results were interpreted by using OptiQuant image analysis software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification of each detectable band was performed from the digital light units generated by OptiQuant. The background was subtracted. The TUNEL Test (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) was performed using the “In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD” from Roche Diagnostics according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Sections were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Hamburg, Germany). RNA was isolated as reported previously (17Lüdde T. Kubicka S. Plumpe J. Liedtke C. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5264-5278Google Scholar). First strand synthesis for RT-PCR was performed using oligo(dT)15primer (Promega) and the Omniscript RT kit (Qiagen) in combination with 1 μg of total RNA per reaction. Amplification of Bcl-xL and GAPDH cDNA was carried out in one reaction using the specific primers (Bcl-xL: sense, 5′-cgacccagccaccacctcctc-3′, and antisense, 5′-tgg ggc ctc agt cct att ctc-3′, cDNA length 316 bp; GAPDH: sense, 5′-tga tga cat caa gaa ggt ggt gaa g-3′, and antisense, 5′-tcc ttg gag gcc atg tag gcc at-3′, cDNA length 249 bp) and 1 μl of the RT reaction. Briefly, PCR was performed for 10 cycles with first strand DNA and Bcl-xL primers at a T anneal of 58 °C. Then the reaction was interrupted; primers for GAPDH were added, and the reaction was continued for another 25 cycles. PCR products were documented and quantitated using a Gel Doc 1000 apparatus (Bio-Rad) and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). For direct comparison the GAPDH:Bcl-xL ratio was determined. Quantification of results was performed with a Fuji imager and Pcbas as described earlier (16Wüstefeld T. Rakemann T. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 514-522Google Scholar). pIpC induces interferon-α expression in vivoand activates the Mx promoter (7Kühn R. Schwenk F. Aguet M. Rajewsky K. Science. 1995; 269: 1427-1429Google Scholar, 18Alonzi T. Maritano D. Gorgoni B. Rizzuto G. Libert C. Poli V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1621-1632Google Scholar). We injected increasing amounts of pIpC in gp130loxP (+/+)/Mx-Cre (+) animals and gp130loxP (+/+)/Mx-Cre (−) to analyze deletion of gp130 exon 16 in the liver. 72 h after pIpC injection, the liver of the animals was harvested, and DNA was prepared. As evidenced by Southern blot analysis, 20 μg of pIpC resulted in a more than 90% deletion of exon 16 in the gp130 locus in Mx-Cre (+) and not inMx-Cre (−) animals (data not shown). With 80 μg (Fig.1 A) and higher amounts (160 and 320 μg, data not shown) of pIpC more than 95% of exon 16 was deleted in gp130loxP (+/+)/Mx-Cre (+) animals. Next, we tested the functional consequences of a deletion higher than 95% of gp130 exon 16 after 80 μg of pIpC injection in the liver. gp130 loxP (+/+/)/Mx-Cre (+) animals were stimulated with 10 μg of IL6/mouse for 3 h at different days after pIpC treatment. Gel shift analysis with a 32P-labeled Stat3 consensus oligonucleotide showed that IL6-dependent Stat3 complex formation was completely blocked 10 days after pIpC administration (data not shown). Earlier results using IL6 knockout mice implied that IL6 is involved in cell cycle progression after PH (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). We performed partial hepatectomies in conditional gp130 knockout mice. gp130 loxP (+/+)/Mx-Cre (+) (also referred to as gp130-deleted) and gp130 loxP (+/+)/Mx-Cre (−) (controls) animals were both treated with 80 μg of pIpC. After 10 days PH was performed. For each time point indicated at least 4 animals were included, and the efficiency of gp130 exon 16 deletion was monitored by Southern blot analysis in the resected liver lobes. For further analysis only mice were included with a deletion efficiency >95%. We first measured IL6 serum levels. In both groups IL6 serum levels increased 3 h after PH (Fig. 1 B). In controls peak IL6 expression was found after 6 h and in the gp130-deleted group after 12 h. Maximal IL6 levels were more than 2-fold higher in the gp130-deleted group, and at later time points the decrease was slower compared with controls (Fig. 1 B). Between the two groups there was no difference in mortality after PH. EMSA experiments revealed strong Stat3 complex formation 1 h after PH in the control group. At later time points complex formation decreased and returned to background levels (Fig. 1 C). In gp130-deleted animals Stat3 activation after PH was completely blocked. No increase in complex formation was found compared with the pretreatment level (Fig. 1 C). Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS-3) is a potent inhibitor of Stat3-dependent gene activation. A recent study by Campbellet al. (19Campbell J.S. Prichard L. Schaper F. Schmitz J. Stephenson-Famy A. Rosenfeld M.E. Argast G.M. Heinrich P.C. Fausto N. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1285-1292Google Scholar) showed a strong regulation of SOCS-3during liver regeneration. Therefore, we investigated SOCS-3mRNA expression in both groups. SOCS-3 transcripts were strongly increased 3 and 6 h (more than 30-fold) after PH in the control group, whereas no regulation was found in gp130-deleted animals (Fig. 1 D). No significant regulation was found forSOCS-1and -2in both groups after PH (data not shown). gp130-dependent signaling was blocked in gp130-deleted mice after PH. In further experiments we determined the effect on DNA synthesis after PH by BrdUrd pulse-labeling experiments in both groups. In the control group a maximum of BrdUrd-positive cells was evident 48 h after PH. 39% ± 5 of all hepatocytes were BrdUrd-positive (Fig. 2, A and B). At later time points BrdUrd-positive cells decreased. In gp130-deleted animals the maximum of BrdUrd-positive cells was observed 48 h after PH and was lower compared with controls. 31% ± 4 nuclei of all hepatocytes were BrdUrd-positive in gp130-deleted animals. At later time points the amount of BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes decreased (Fig. 2, A and B). In further experiments we studied the impact of gp130 deletion on cyclin expression after PH. Cyclin A and E expression was studied by Western blot experiments. In control animals cyclin E expression was first positive 12 h after PH. There was a continuous increase in cyclin E expression for up to 48 h. At later time points cyclin E expression decreased (Fig.3 A). In gp130-deleted animals, cyclin E was only detected 24 h after PH, and a strong increase was observed up to 48 h after PH. At 72 h cyclin E expression declined (Fig. 3 B). Cyclin A expression in controls was detected 40 h after PH and decreased thereafter, whereas in gp130-deleted animals cyclin A expression was first positive at the 48-h time point (Fig. 3,C and D). Earlier experiments showed even more pronounced differences in cell cycle progression after hepatectomy in IL6 knockout animals compared with controls (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar, 12Sakamoto T. Liu Z. Murase N. Ezure T. Yokomuro S. Poli V. Demetris A.J. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 403-411Google Scholar). Therefore we searched for specific pathways to understand how IL6 may influence cell cycle progression in the liver. We stimulated gp130-deleted and control mice with IL6 for 6 h and prepared mRNA. The mRNAs of untreated and IL6-stimulated animals were used for gene array analysis. The focus of this analysis was on genes that are involved in cell cycle control. This analysis revealed two genes, c-jun and c-myc, that might have an impact on G0/G1 phase transition and are regulated in an IL6-dependent manner in the liver (Fig.4 A). No impact on genes directly involved in cell cycle control-like cyclins was found. The gene array analysis showed also a strong effect on the expression pattern of the TNF-R1and -R2(Fig.4 B). The gp130-deleted animals are blocked in regulating the TNF-R expression. In further experiments we tried to specify our gene array data by studying c-myc RNA expression by Northern blot analysis before and after PH. Basal expression and the induction after PH as found in controls were reduced in gp130-deleted animals. Thus gp130-dependent pathways contribute to the basal and inducible c-myc expression after PH (data not shown). c-Jun is a member of the AP1 complex. Activation after PH was studied by gel shift experiments using a 32P-labeled AP1 consensus oligonucleotide. Strong complex formation was evident 1–36 h after PH in controls. At later time points complex formation decreased and was reduced to pretreatment levels (Fig. 4 C). In the gp130-deleted animals specific complex formation was first evident only 36 h after hepatectomy and remained high 48 h after PH (Fig.4 C). In addition to c-Jun, it has been shown also for NF-κB that its activation correlates with liver regeneration after PH (20Morello D. Fitzgerald M.J. Babinet C. Fausto N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3185-3193Google Scholar, 21Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30429-30435Google Scholar). In controls, biphasic NF-κB activation was evident 1–6 and 24–36 h after PH (Fig. 4 D). In gp130-deleted mice the first peak of NF-κB activation was strongly reduced, whereas the second peak could be detected equally to controls (Fig. 4 D). Our experiments in the gp130-deleted animals indicated that gp130-dependent pathways are essential for liver cells in contributing to the activation of distinct immediate early genes as shown previously (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). Because in our experiments the impact on DNA synthesis was less prominent after PH as in IL6 −/− mice (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar), we performed partial hepatectomies in IL6 knockout animals (13Weinhold B. Ruther U. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 425-429Google Scholar) and monitored BrdUrd incorporation. DNA synthesis was increased in controls 24 h after PH. Maximal levels were found 48 h after PH. 72 h after PH the amount of BrdUrd-positive cells decreased (Fig. 5, A andB). Compared with controls in IL6 −/− animals the increase and maximum in DNA synthesis was moderately reduced (Fig. 5,A and B). As strain-specific differences may account for changes in hepatocyte proliferation, we additionally performed PHs in a second IL6 −/− strain (14Kopf M. Baumann H. Freer G. Freudenberg M. Lamers M. Kishimoto T. Zinkernagel R. Bluethmann H. Kohler G. Nature. 1994; 368: 339-342Google Scholar) and stained for BrdUrd-positive cells. These results were consistent with the data obtained in the first IL6 −/− strain (data not shown). IL6 contributes to acute phase gene expression and represents a first line of defense after bacterial infections (22Trautwein C. Böker K. Manns M.P. Gut. 1994; 35: 1163-1166Google Scholar). Thus after abdominal surgery the outcome may depend upon the ability of the liver to control unspecific defense mechanisms. In further experiments the impact on acute phase gene expression was studied in gp130-deleted mice. As shown in Fig.6 A, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin and hemopexin gene expression were increased starting 3–6 h, and maximal levels were evident 24 h after PH in controls. In contrast, this increase in acute phase gene expression after PH was not found in gp130-deleted mice (Fig. 6 A). Albumin mRNA expression decreased after PH in the control group (Fig. 6 A). In gp130-deleted animals only minor variations in albumin mRNA levels were detected in the first 12 h post-PH (Fig. 6 A). These results demonstrate that after PH regulation of the acute phase response is blocked in gp130-deleted animals. As regulation of the acute phase response was impaired in gp130-deleted animals, we investigated the impact of a bacterial infection, mimicked by LPS injection, on liver regeneration. LPS was injected 3 h after PH, and the impact on survival and DNA synthesis was studied. LPS-treated, gp130-deleted animals had a significantly worse outcome compared with controls. In the gp130-deleted group 40% of the animals died during the first 48 h after PH. In contrast, the survival rate in controls was 85% after LPS injection (p < 0.01, Fig. 6 B). Higher mortality correlated with a decrease in DNA synthesis in gp130-deleted animals who survived. BrdUrd staining after 48 h revealed an 80% lower rate of BrdUrd-positive hepatocytes in gp130-deleted animals compared with controls (Fig. 6 C). As LPS had a significant effect on survival and DNA synthesis of gp130-deleted animals, we also tested the impact of LPS on survival in IL6 knockout animals compared with controls (Fig.7 A). IL6 −/− animals and controls were treated with LPS 3 h after PH. Survival was evaluated in the first 48 h after PH. In the IL6 −/− animals significantly more animals died after PH (p < 0.05) when they were treated with LPS compared with controls and untreated animals. Thus as found in the gp130-deleted animals, IL6 −/− mice were more susceptible to LPS after PH (Fig. 7 A). These differences were also reflected when BrdUrd staining was performed in the liver of these animals. DNA synthesis 48 h after PH in LPS-treated IL6 −/− mice was significantly reduced compared with controls (Fig. 7 B). The LPS/PH experiments indicated that protective mechanism might be impaired in gp130-deleted animals. Additionally, earlier experiments showed that IL6 might stimulate anti-apoptotic pathways by inducing higher Bcl-xLexpression (23Kovalovich K. Li W. DeAngelis R. Greenbaum L.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26605-26613Google Scholar). Therefore we studied Bcl-xLexpression through an RT-PCR approach early after PH. In control animals we found an increase in Bcl-xL expression 3 h after PH which was not found in gp130-deleted animals (Fig. 8,A and B). As differences in Bcl-xL regulation might be one of the gp130-dependent mechanisms protecting from apoptosis after LPS stimulation, we now studied if there is a difference in the degree of apoptosis between controls and gp130-deleted animals. At the 3-h LPS/6-h PH time point we found a significant increase in apoptosis in the gp130-deleted animals compared with controls (Fig. 8 C). In gp130-deleted mice 15-fold more liver cells were TUNEL-positive compared with controls (Fig. 8 D). The molecular mechanisms essential to restore liver mass after injury are complex, and the intra- and extracellular pathways that orchestrate liver regeneration have recently become clearer on a molecular level (11Streetz K.L. Luedde T. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Gut. 2000; 47: 309-312Google Scholar, 24Fausto N. Laird A.D. Webber E.M. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1527-1536Google Scholar, 25Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Google Scholar). Earlier experiments showed that after partial hepatectomy there is activation of Stat3 in the first hours after surgery (8Trautwein C. Rakemann T. Niehof M.

Further experiments using IL6 knockout mice demonstrated that this cytokine is involved in regulating the regenerative response after PH (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). Additionally, TNF-R1 knockout mice showed a lack in liver regeneration that could be rescued by injecting IL6 (10Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Google Scholar). Based on these data a model has been deducted where first TNFα and then IL6 serum levels are increased, and the intracellular pathways that are activated through these two cytokines are essential to trigger cell cycle progression after PH. In the present study we were interested to examine further the role of IL6 for liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy using conditional gp130 knockout mice. After birth Cre expression in gp130loxP/Mx-Cre animals was induced by pIpC injection. Earlier experiments demonstrated that in these animals efficient deletion of gp130 exon 16 was achieved in the liver and other tissue contributing to the immune response (spleen, bone marrow, thymus) (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). In the liver more than 95% of exon 16 in the gp130 locus was deleted, and IL6-dependent Stat3 activation was inhibited, in contrast to controls. All of the IL6 family members need gp130 for signal transduction, and thus the use of gp130 loxP/Mx-Cre animals circumvents the possibility that other cytokines of this family may compensate for the loss of each other (1Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Google Scholar,2Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Muller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Google Scholar). After PH in hepatocytes of the control group strong Stat3 activation was restricted to the first hours after PH, whereas maximal IL6 serum levels were found after 6 h. Recent experiments published by Fausto and co-workers (19Campbell J.S. Prichard L. Schaper F. Schmitz J. Stephenson-Famy A. Rosenfeld M.E. Argast G.M. Heinrich P.C. Fausto N. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 1285-1292Google Scholar) have revealed a molecular explanation for this observation. They demonstrated that only 1 h after partial hepatectomy SOCS-3 is induced on the mRNA level and reached maximum expression after 2 h. In the present analysis we further characterized this mechanism and showed that SOCS-3is controlled via gp130-dependent pathways in hepatocytes. Thus, through increasing SOCS-3 expression via gp130, Stat3 activation is strongly restricted after PH. In our study there is a discrepancy between the relatively early activation of Stat3 after partial hepatectomy and the late peak of IL6 serum expression. As in the gp130-deleted animals no Stat3 DNA binding was found, and activation is likely to be mediated through a gp130-dependent cytokine. Additionally in IL6 −/− animals no Stat3 activation was found after PH (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). These two observations clearly indicate that IL6 induces Stat3 after PH. Therefore it is likely that increased IL6 levels are first present in the liver after PH as the cytokine at this stage may mainly bind to membrane-bound gp80. At later time points, gp80 receptors in the liver are saturated, and increased IL6 levels are present in the serum of the animals. In the serum IL6 is bound to soluble gp80 and soluble gp130 receptors that limit the activation of gp130-dependent pathways also in liver cells. As the pool of soluble gp130 is increased in the gp130-deleted animals, IL6 has a longer half-life in the serum of these animals. Liver regeneration in gp130-deleted animals showed marked differences compared with controls. Stat3 activation was completely blocked, and gene array analysis defined additional gp130-dependent downstream targets, c-myc and c-jun, after PH. Additionally, our experiments suggest that NF-κB activation at the early time points during liver regeneration is gp130-dependent. The explanation for diminished NF-κB and AP1 activation after partial hepatectomy might be caused on different levels. However, our gene array analysis also included TNF-R1and TNF-R2. Interestingly, the expression of both receptors is controlled via IL6 as in gp130-deleted animals the basal and the inducible expression of TNF-R1 and the inducible expression of TNF-R2 are significantly reduced (Fig. 4 B). As NF-κB and AP1 are controlled via TNF after PH, these results would explain in part a reduction in the activation of both transcription factors in the gp130-deleted animals after PH. Our work is in agreement and expands earlier reports of Taub and co-workers (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar) and Fausto and co-workers (10Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Google Scholar) indicating that activation of distinct immediate early genes is dependent on IL6 after PH (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar, 10Yamada Y. Kirillova I. Peschon J.J. Fausto N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1441-1446Google Scholar). However, DNA synthesis was reduced in conditional gp130 knockout animals but less severely impaired as described previously in IL6 −/− animals. The increase in cyclin A and E expression was delayed in gp130-deleted animals, which was associated with a minor reduction in DNA synthesis 48 h after PH. Gene array analysis revealed no significant impact of IL6 on genes directly involved in cell cycle control. Similar results were also reported in IL6 −/− mice using gene array analysis after PH (27Li W. Liang X. Leu J.I. Kovalovich K. Ciliberto G. Taub R. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1377-1386Google Scholar). Therefore, the gp130-deleted animals could eventually restore liver mass and had no increased mortality compared with controls. Obviously, the observed reduction of immediate early gene activation in gp130-deleted mice implies that in the liver compensatory pathways do exist to induce hepatocyte proliferation. This result was unexpected. However, further evaluation of the IL6 −/− experiments of Cressmann et al. (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar) revealed that they quoted those IL6 −/− animals that survived the follow up after hepatectomy had a normal liver weight 5 days after hepatectomy. These results imply that IL6 is important but not absolutely necessary in order to restore liver mass after PH. Otherwise there would be no obvious explanation that some of the IL6 −/− animals survived and completely restored their liver mass. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the report of Demitris and co-workers (12Sakamoto T. Liu Z. Murase N. Ezure T. Yokomuro S. Poli V. Demetris A.J. Hepatology. 1999; 29: 403-411Google Scholar) using IL6 −/− mice. They demonstrated that in IL6 −/− mice the reduction in DNA synthesis after PH is less severe as originally observed by Cressmann et al. (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar) and was comparable with the degree of reduction in DNA synthesis in our present experiments. In our earlier reports we used a transgenic mouse that overexpressed the soluble IL6 receptor under the control of a hepatocyte-specific control element. In these animals IL6 induces severalfold stronger gp130-dependent signaling in hepatocytes. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, PH and IL6 stimulation did not result in an increase of hepatocyte proliferation but to a delay in cell cycle progression. Thus hyperstimulation of gp130-dependent pathways in hepatocytes was not associated with increased DNA synthesis. The discrepancy in the results of different groups in the correlation between IL6 and hepatocyte proliferation was obvious. Thus it was difficult to ultimately define the role of IL6 and thus of gp130-dependent signals for liver regeneration. Therefore, we considered other means to explain the role of IL6 for cell cycle progression after PH. Recent studies (23Kovalovich K. Li W. DeAngelis R. Greenbaum L.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26605-26613Google Scholar, 28Galun E. Zeira E. Pappo O. Peters M. Rose-John S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1979-1987Google Scholar, 29Selzner M. Camargo C.A. Clavien P.A. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 469-475Google Scholar) demonstrated that IL6 induces protective, e.g. anti-apoptotic, pathways in hepatocytes. These results led us to consider the possibility that the role of IL6 in the liver after PH is not mainly to trigger cell cycle progression through immediate early genes but instead is to protect the liver from injury during this complex step. We show in our study that in gp130-deleted animals acute phase gene regulation and thus early defense mechanisms are blocked after PH. Therefore, to mimic a bacterial infection, we injected LPS in gp130-deleted and control animals after PH. These experiments revealed striking differences in the outcome of these animals similar to the results obtained in the initial PH experiments reported in the IL6 −/− animals (9Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. DeAngelis R.A. Ciliberto G. Furth E.E. Poli V. Taub R. Science. 1996; 274: 1379-1383Google Scholar). After PH DNA synthesis was reduced in the surviving LPS-injected gp130-deleted animals, and the same phenotype was found when LPS was injected into IL6 −/− mice after PH. Consistent with this observation, hepatocyte-specific gp130 knockout animals are also hypersensitive to LPS indicating that gp130-dependent pathways in hepatocytes are essential for this observation (30Streetz K. Wuestefeld T. Graw A. Kamino K. Tronche F. Betz U. Muller W. Manns M. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 278Google Scholar). In further experiments we investigated the possible mechanism that might account for higher LPS sensitivity. As in earlier experiments Kovalovich et al. (23Kovalovich K. Li W. DeAngelis R. Greenbaum L.E. Ciliberto G. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26605-26613Google Scholar) showed that IL6 induces Bcl-xLexpression, and we investigated its expression by RT-PCR and found lower expression in the gp130-deleted animals. After PH the finding correlated with a higher rate of apoptosis in the gp130-deleted animals after LPS stimulation indicating that this is most likely an important mechanism that contributes to the worse outcome in these animals after partial hepatectomy and LPS stimulation. Based on these results we define more specifically the role of the IL6/gp130-dependent pathway during liver regeneration. Higher IL6 expression after PH is important to activate protective pathways that render hepatocytes more resistant toward stress-inducing signals, e.g. bacterial infections after PH. Our results suggest that the phenotype of gp130-deleted and IL6 knockout animals after PH is related to the degree of additional injury. These results would nicely explain why there are differences in the literature upon the strength of the phenotype in IL6 −/− mice after partial hepatectomy."

In NIH-3T3-L1 adipocytes cultured in low glucose (LG; 2.5 mm), the half-maximal activation concentration (<i>A</i> <sub>0.5</sub>) of glucose 6-phosphate was 162 ± 15 μm. Exposure to either high glucose (HG; 20 mm) or glucosamine (GlcN; 10 mm) increased the A<sub>0.5</sub> to 558 ± 61 or 612 ± 34 μm.

Insulin resistance was not explained by increased phosphorylation of synthase. In fact, culture with GlcN decreased phosphorylation to 61% of the levels seen in cells cultured in LG. Hexosamine flux and subsequent enzymatic protein<i>O</i>-glycosylation have been postulated to mediate nutrient sensing and insulin resistance. Glycogen synthase is modified by<i>O</i>-linked <i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine, and the level of glycosylation increased in cells treated with HG or GlcN.

After enzymatic removal of <i>O</i>-GlcNAc, however, subsequent digestion with phosphatase increased basal activity to over 73% for LG, HG, and GlcN. We conclude that <i>O</i>-GlcNAc modification of glycogen synthase results in the retention of the enzyme in a glucose 6-phosphate-dependent state and contributes to the reduced activation of the enzyme in insulin resistance."

It has been observed that OmpA folds relatively fast into micelles but with rather slow kinetics into phospholipid membranes (7Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2283-2288Google Scholar). Previous studies have also shown that urea-unfolded OmpA inserts and folds into phospholipid bilayers by a highly concerted mechanism that takes place via at least three structurally distinct membrane-bound folding intermediates (8Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4996-5005Google Scholar, 9Kleinschmidt J.H. den Blaauwen T. Driessen A. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5006-5016Google Scholar, 10Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Google Scholar). The folding kinetics and the yields of folded OmpA depended strongly on the properties of the lipid bilayer (6Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 319-330Google Scholar, 11Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28199-28203Google Scholar, 16Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28199-28203Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that secondary and tertiary structure formation in OmpA are synchronized and coupled to membrane insertion (6Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 319-330Google Scholar). However, in these previous studies, the OmpA folding kinetics were relatively slow, suggesting that folding in vivo might be facilitated by folding catalysts. The folding of soluble proteins in the cytoplasm is assisted by molecular chaperones (for recent reviews, see Refs. 17Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Google Scholar, 18Ben-Zvi A.P. Goloubinoff P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 135: 84-93Google Scholar, 19Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Google Scholar, 20Lund P.A. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2001; 44: 93-140Google Scholar). It is not known how molecular chaperones facilitate the folding process of membrane proteins. Periplasmic and OMPs of Gram-negative bacteria are translocated across the inner membrane in a mostly unfolded form by the SecA/E/Y/G export system (see Refs. 21Manting E.H. Driessen A.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 226-238Google Scholar, 22Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Google Scholar). In the periplasm, a signal peptidase cleaves off the signal sequence. It has been suggested that periplasmic proteins assist in the assembly of OMPs, because reduced concentrations of some OMPs in the outer membrane of E. coliwere observed after deletion of the genes for the periplasmic proteins Skp or SurA (23Chen R. Henning U. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1287-1294Google Scholar, 24Rouvière P.E. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3170-3182Google Scholar, 25Lazar S.W. Kolter R. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1770-1773Google Scholar). Skp binds to the NH2-terminal part of OmpA and is required for the release of incompletely folded OmpA into the periplasm (26Schäfer U. Beck K. Müller M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24567-24574Google Scholar, 27Harms N. Koningstein G. Dontje W. Müller M. Oudega B. Luirink J. de Cock H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18804-18811Google Scholar). The conditions that OMPs require for subsequent folding and membrane insertion have not yet been described. The skp gene maps at the 4-min region on the chromosome and is located upstream of genes that encode proteins involved in lipid A biosynthesis (28Roy A.M. Coleman J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1639-1646Google Scholar, 29Dicker I.B. Seetharam S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 334-344Google Scholar, 30Thome B.M. Hoffschulte H.K. Schiltz E. Müller M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 269: 113-116Google Scholar). For example, the gene firA, which codes for UDP-3-O-[3-hydroxymyristoyl]glucosamine-N-acyltransferase is located only four bases downstream of the stop codon ofskp (31Bothmann H. Plückthun A. Nature Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 376-380Google Scholar). Lipid A is an essential component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that is present in the periplasm after biogenesis (32Trent M.S. Ribeiro A.A. Doerrler W.T. Lin S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43132-43144Google Scholar) and the major component of the outer leaflet of the outer membrane. Pulse-labeling and biochemical reconstitution experiments suggested that LPS is required for efficient assembly of OMPs such as trimeric PhoE (33de Cock H. Brandenburg K. Wiese A. Holst O. Seydel U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5114-5119Google Scholar) and monomeric OmpA (34Freudl R. Schwarz H. Stierhof Y.D. Gamon K. Hindennach I. Henning U. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11355-11361Google Scholar) into outer membranes. In these previous studies, refolding was performed with micelles of LPS and Triton X-100 instead of phospholipid bilayers. It is not clear whether the LPS concentration in the periplasm is above the CMC, but OMPs would not fold in the presence of monomers (7Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2065-2071Google Scholar). Also, the prefolding of OMPs into LPS micelles and subsequent fusion of the micelles with the outer membrane can lead to two different orientations of OMPs in the lipid bilayer, but only one direction of OMPs is observed in cells. The long β-strand-connecting loops are facing the extracellular space. In this study, we sought to explore possible assisted folding pathways of OmpA. We have addressed the following questions. 1) How do Skp and LPS (either separately or in combination) affect unfolded OmpA in solution? 2) Are there effects of Skp (or LPS) on the folding of OmpA into lipid bilayers? 3) At which stoichiometries and how strong does Skp (or LPS) bind to OmpA? 4) Does Skp (or LPS) lead to secondary structure formation of OmpA in solution? The Skp protein was purified from the periplasmic fraction of E. coli CAG16037 (35Mecsas J. Rouvière P.E. Erickson J.W. Donohue T.J. Gross C.A.

The cells were harvested at an A 600 of ∼1.5, resuspended in sucrose buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20% sucrose) and equilibrated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation, cells were resuspended in sucrose buffer with 10 mm EDTA and incubated with lysozyme (10 μg/ml) for 30 min on ice. Spheroplasts were sedimented at low speed after the addition of MgSO4 (20 mm). The resulting periplasmic fraction was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl), run through a Poros® DEAE column and then loaded onto a Poros CM column. The DEAE column was removed, and the CM column was washed with 3 volumes of buffer A. Skp was eluted from the column by a NaCl gradient (100–750 mm NaCl in buffer A), dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against buffer A, and concentrated in Centriprep YM-3 concentrator units (Amicon). The Skp concentration was determined photometrically at 280 nm with a molar absorption coefficient of 1280m−1 cm−1 (37Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Google Scholar) and using the method of Lowry et al. (38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. OmpA was purified from E. coli as described previously (16Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Google Scholar). OmpA concentrations of stock solutions were determined using the method of Lowry et al.(38Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Google Scholar). E. coli rough mutant F576 was cultivated as described previously (39Vinogradov E.V. Van Der Drift K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Meshkov S. Brade H. Holst O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 629-639Google Scholar), and its LPS (R2 core type, M ≈ 3900 g/mol) was isolated as reported previously (40Müller-Loennies S. Holst O. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 751-760Google Scholar). 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (DOPG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Lipids were dissolved in chloroform and mixed to a molar ratio of 50% DOPC, 30% DOPE, and 20% DOPG. The lipid mixtures were first dried under a stream of nitrogen and then in the desiccator under high vacuum for at least 3 h. Lipids were then hydrated in 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.0, with 2 mm EDTA and dispersed by vortexing. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonicating the lipid dispersions with a Branson W450D ultrasonicator for 40 min with a 50% pulse cycle. When isolated from bacteria using the method by Surrey and Jähnig (16Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7457-7461Google Scholar), OmpA is completely unfolded in 8m urea. The folding of OmpA was initiated by rapidly mixing 5 μl of denatured OmpA first with 46 μl of HEPES buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0, with 2 mm EDTA) containing Skp followed by the immediate addition of 10 μl of LPS and then by the addition of 35 μl of preformed lipid bilayers. The final concentrations were 7.1 μm OmpA, 28.4 μmSkp, 1.4 mm lipid, and from 7.1 to 280 μmLPS. When experiments were performed in the absence of Skp, LPS, or lipid vesicles, the corresponding solutions were replaced by the same volume of buffer. Unless indicated otherwise, all of the mixing steps were performed in this sequence very rapidly. Samples of the reaction mixture were taken at different times after the initiation of folding, and an equal volume of 0.125 m Tris buffer, pH 6.8, containing 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol was added. SDS binds to both folded and unfolded OmpA and inhibits further folding (10Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Google Scholar, 11Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28199-28203Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described previously (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar, 42Weber K. Osborne M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 244: 4406-4412Google Scholar) but without heat denaturation of the samples. The different electrophoretic mobilities of folded (apparent molecular mass = 30 kDa) and unfolded OmpA (apparent molecular mass = 35 kDa) were used to determine the fraction of folded OmpA by densitometry as described previously (10Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Google Scholar). Time courses of folding were monitored over 180 min. Experimental errors were estimated from three to six experiments. 5.3 μl of a stock solution of OmpA (3 mg/ml) were diluted first into buffer. The buffer volume was calculated for each experiment to obtain a final volume of 150 μl. In experiments with Skp, LPS, or lipid vesicles, 5.9 μl of a stock solution of Skp (1.8 mg/ml), 16.6 μl of a stock solution of LPS (0.5 mg/ml), or 23.5 μl of a stock solution of lipid vesicles (3.9 mm) were added in this sequence. The mixing of all of the reactants was done rapidly in an Eppendorf vial. Samples were incubated for at least 3 h and then transferred into a CD cuvette. Far-UV CD spectra of 3.0 μm OmpA were recorded at 20 °C on a Jasco 715 CD spectrometer using a 0.5-mm thermostated cuvette. Five scans were accumulated from 190 to 250 nm (205–250 nm in presence of 8 m urea) with a response time of 16 s, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a scan speed of 10 nm/min. Background spectra without OmpA and Skp were subtracted. The recorded CD spectra were normalized to obtain the mean residue molar ellipticity [Θ](λ) as shown in Equation 1, [Θ](λ)=100Θ(λ)(c1×n1+c2×n2)×lEquation 1 where l is the path length of the thermostated cuvette and Θ(λ) is the recorded ellipticity at wavelength λ.c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations, and n 1 andn 2 are the numbers of the amino acid residues of OmpA and Skp, respectively. LPS (M = 3900 g/mol) binding to unfolded OmpA was determined by first recording background spectra of LPS at different concentrations in 490 μl of glycine buffer (10 mm, pH 8.5). The LPS concentration ranged from 0 to 0.13 mg/ml. After the addition of 10 μl of urea-denatured OmpA (1 mg/ml), the fluorescence spectra of OmpA were recorded at each LPS concentration. The background spectra exhibited only very weak intensity because of light scattering and were subtracted. Skp binding to OmpA was determined analogously in 500 μl of glycine buffer at Skp concentrations ranging from 0 to 0.08 mg/ml and at an OmpA concentration of 0.02 mg/ml. Background spectra of Skp were subtracted. Skp does not contain tryptophan and is only weakly fluorescent when excited at 290 nm. Fluorescence spectra were recorded as described previously (10Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Google Scholar) on a Spex Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer with double monochromators in the excitation and emission pathways. The excitation wavelength was 290 nm, and the bandwidths of the excitation monochromators were 3 nm. The bandwidths of the emission monochromators were 3.5 nm. The integration time was 0.1 s, and an increment of 0.5 nm was used to scan spectra in the range of 310–370 nm. The association constant K for the binding of the ligand L (i.e. LPS or Skp) to a protein binding site Px(Px + L → PxL) as defined by the mass action law, i.e. K = [PxL]/([Px][L]) was determined by fitting the fluorescence intensities as a function of molar ratio of ligand added to the protein. It was assumed that all of the binding sites on the protein are equivalent for all of the molecules of the selected ligand (either LPS or Skp). To investigate how Skp and LPS affect the folding kinetics of OmpA, we used an electrophoretic mobility assay as described previously (6Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 319-330Google Scholar, 10Kleinschmidt J.H. Tamm L.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12993-13000Google Scholar, 11Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol.

In SDS-PAGE, folded OmpA migrates at 30 kDa, whereas unfolded OmpA migrates at 35 kDa if not heat-denatured prior to electrophoresis (43Schweizer M. Hindennach I. Garten W. Henning U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Google Scholar). The 30-kDa form has been shown by Raman, Fourier Transform Infrared, and CD spectroscopy (7Kleinschmidt J.H. Wiener M.C. Tamm L.K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 2065-2071Google Scholar, 11Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28199-28203Google Scholar, 16Surrey T. Jähnig F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Google Scholar) and by single channel conductivity measurements (47Arora A. Rinehart D. Szabo G. Tamm L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1594-1600Google Scholar) to correspond to completely folded and active OmpA. In the experiments shown in Fig.1, the folding of OmpA upon dilution of the denaturant urea was monitored at pH 7.0 over a time course of 180 min. In presence of Skp in aqueous solution, OmpA did not fold (Fig.1 A, gel 1). When OmpA was incubated with a 5-fold molar excess of LPS (Fig. 1 A, gel 2), approximately 45% OmpA folded as analyzed by densitometry (Fig.1 B, ▴). OmpA folding quickly leveled off within 1 h after initiation of folding. However, folding into LPS was strongly inhibited when OmpA was first reacted with Skp prior to the addition of LPS (Fig. 1, A, gel 3, and B, ♦). Consistent with previous reports (11Surrey T. Jähnig F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28199-28203Google Scholar), OmpA refolded to 75% when reacted with preformed phospholipid bilayers (Fig. 1 A,gel 4, and B, ⊗). When OmpA was preincubated first with Skp and then with LPS before vesicles were added, up to 90% folding of OmpA into phospholipid bilayers was observed (Fig.1 A, gel 5). Also, the SDS gels and their densitometric analysis indicated much faster folding kinetics (Fig.1 B, ●) in comparison with OmpA refolding into lipid bilayers in the absence of Skp and LPS. Before preincubation with Skp and LPS, the denaturant urea was diluted 10-fold (see “Experimental Procedures”), i.e. to a concentration lower then necessary to keep OmpA unfolded. Because the same vesicle preparations were used and the reactions analyzed in gels 4 and 5 were performed in parallel, we concluded that the interaction with Skp and LPS prevented a hydrophobic collapse of OmpA after urea dilution. The improved folding kinetics of OmpA into phospholipid bilayers after preincubation with Skp and LPS raised the question of whether these periplasmic components were mutually required to assist the folding of OmpA into lipid bilayers or whether one component, either Skp or LPS, would suffice. Fig.2 shows the time dependence of OmpA folding into lipid bilayers as analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subsequent densitometry. In panel A, preformed lipid bilayers were added to OmpA immediately after urea dilution in the presence of Skp (♦), in the presence of LPS (▴), in the presence of Skp and LPS (●), and in the absence of Skp and LPS (⊗). The four experiments were performed in parallel with the same stock solutions. Folding kinetics into lipid bilayers were fastest and folding was most complete when Skp and LPS were both present. When Skp and LPS were both absent, the folding into lipid bilayers was less efficient. However, when only one of the periplasmic components, either Skp or LPS, was added, the efficiency of OmpA folding into lipid bilayers was further reduced. In a second set of experiments (Fig. 2, panel B), LPS and lipid were added 30 min after dilution of the denaturant with buffer in the presence or absence of Skp (panel B). The introduction of this delay led to much stronger dependencies of the folding kinetics and yields of folded OmpA in the presence of Skp and LPS. When LPS was added to Skp·OmpA complexes prior to lipid addition (●), the largest folding yields were obtained (>90%). When only Skp was present (♦), OmpA folding into lipid bilayers was slowest and the lowest folding yields were observed. Slow folding and low yields were also observed when LPS and lipid bilayers were added 30 min after dilution of urea by addition of Skp-free buffer to OmpA (▴). When OmpA was incubated in the presence of LPS but in the absence of Skp for 30 min prior to the addition of preformed lipid bilayers (▵), OmpA partially folded as observed previously (Fig. 1, ▴). In this experiment, the folding yields were lower than observed for OmpA folding into lipid bilayers in the absence of LPS (⊗). With one exception, even slower folding kinetics and lower yields of folded OmpA were observed when the delay time was increased to 1 h for all of the folding reactions (data not shown). Still, up to 90% OmpA folded after 180 min when OmpA was preincubated with Skp for 1 h before LPS and lipid were added. In contrast, a 1-h preincubation of OmpA in buffer in the absence of LPS and Skp led to <60% folding after the addition of lipid bilayers. Based on these results, we concluded the following. 1) Skp alone prevents the aggregation or misfolding of OmpA in solution, because the addition of LPS and preformed lipid bilayers after >30 min still leads to efficient folding. 2) LPS is required for efficient folding of OmpA into lipid bilayers from Skp·OmpA complexes. In the absence of LPS, Skp strongly inhibits insertion and folding of OmpA. To determine the stoichiometry and the strength of the binding of Skp and LPS to unfolded OmpA in solution, we used intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy (Fig.3). First, LPS binding to unfolded OmpA in aqueous solution was investigated. We observed an increasing Trp fluorescence of OmpA at 330 nm with increasing LPS concentration until a saturation was reached (Fig. 3 A). When these fluorescence intensities were fitted as a function of the LPS concentration to a simple mass action law for LPS binding (assuming equivalent LPS binding sites), a stoichiometry of 25 ± 2 LPS molecules bound to unfolded OmpA was obtained. The association constant for LPS·OmpA complex formation wasK LPS = 1.2 ± 0.7 μm−1, corresponding to a free energy of ΔG LPSo = −34.7 ± 1.5 kJ/mol for LPS binding to OmpA. We then investigated the binding of Skp to unfolded OmpA. Small fluorescence contributions of Skp were measured at each Skp concentration and subtracted from the OmpA fluorescence intensity after mixing. The fluorescence intensity of OmpA increased strongly as a function of the molar Skp/OmpA ratio (Fig. 3 B). We fitted our data to the mass action law for Skp binding and found a binding stoichiometry of 2.8 ± 0.1 ≈ 3 Skp molecules bound per OmpA molecule. The binding curve sharply levels off at this stoichiometry, indicating strong binding of Skp to unfolded OmpA. From the fit to the mass action law of Skp binding, we estimatedK Skp = 46 ± 30 μm−1, corresponding to a free energy of ΔG Skpo = −43 ± 2 kJ/mol. This binding constant is between 8- and 150-fold higher than the binding constant of LPS and demonstrates a preferred binding of Skp to OmpA over LPS. To examine how different LPS/OmpA ratios affect the folding of OmpA into a 200-fold molar excess of lipid, we performed folding experiments in the absence (Fig.4 A) and presence (Fig.4 B) of a 4-fold molar excess of Skp at molar LPS/OmpA ratios ranging from 0 to 40. Experiments with and without Skp at the same LPS/OmpA ratio were performed in parallel using the same lipid vesicle preparation (Fig. 4). Representative gels shown in Fig. 4 A demonstrate the time courses of OmpA folding into lipid bilayers at molar LPS/OmpA ratios of 0, 1, 5, 7, and 40 in absence of Skp. The corresponding mole fractions of folded OmpA are shown in Fig. 4 C. In absence of LPS, ∼70% OmpA folded within 180 min (as observed in our previous experiment) (Fig. 1 A, gel 4, and B, ⊗). When LPS was present, the rates of folding and the yields of folded OmpA decreased with increasing LPS/OmpA ratios. At a 40-fold molar excess of LPS (Fig. 4, A and C), only ∼30% OmpA folded within 180 min, indicating that insertion and folding of OmpA into phospholipid bilayers are inhibited by LPS in the absence of Skp. In presence of Skp, LPS increased the folding rates and yields of folded OmpA as indicated by the gels (Fig. 4 B) and the densitometric analysis (Fig. 4 D). When LPS was added to complexes of Skp and OmpA (at 4 Skp/OmpA) prior to the addition of preformed phospholipid bilayers, the highest yields of folded OmpA were obtained at molar LPS/OmpA ratios between 2 and 7 and >90% OmpA folded. When we further increased the amounts of LPS added to OmpA·Skp complexes, LPS inhibited OmpA folding into lipid bilayers at LPS/OmpA molar ratios of >10, similar to the LPS effect on the folding of OmpA in the absence of Skp (panel A). In comparison with the set of experiments in the absence of Skp (panel A), 50% OmpA still folded even at 40 LPS/OmpA. In the absence of LPS, Skp slightly inhibited the folding of OmpA into lipid bilayers (Fig. 4,A and B, gels 0) as determined by densitometry (Fig. 4, C and D, ●). This inhibitory effect of Skp in the absence of LPS was stronger at a higher Skp/OmpA ratio of 8 mol/mol (gel not shown) or in experiments with delayed lipid addition (Fig. 2 B, ♦). The yields of OmpA folding after 180 min are summarized in Fig.5. To obtain more information on the folding of OmpA in the presence of equimolar amounts of Skp, we recorded circular dichroism spectra (Fig. 6) of OmpA·Skp complexes (—) in aqueous solution (panel A) in the presence of a 5-fold molar ex"
https://openalex.org/W1989712305,"The adenovirus VA1 RNA (VA1), a 160-nucleotide (nt)-long RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III, is efficiently exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it antagonizes the interferon-induced antiviral defense system. We recently reported that nuclear export of VA1 is mediated by a cis-acting RNA export motif, called minihelix, that comprises a double-stranded stem (>14 nt) with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3–8-nt protruding 3′ end. RNA export mediated by the minihelix motif is Ran-dependent, which indicates the involvement of a karyopherin-related factor (exportin) that remained to be determined. Here we show using microinjection in Xenopus laevis oocytes that VA1 is transported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5, a nuclear transport factor for double-stranded RNA binding proteins. Gel retardation assays revealed that exportin-5 directly interacts with VA1 RNA in a RanGTP-dependent manner. More generally, in vivo and in vitro competition experiments using various VA1-derived, but also artificial and cellular, RNAs lead to the conclusion that exportin-5 preferentially recognizes and transports minihelix motif-containing RNAs.

More generally, in vivo and in vitro competition experiments using various VA1-derived, but also artificial and cellular, RNAs lead to the conclusion that exportin-5 preferentially recognizes and transports minihelix motif-containing RNAs. Nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of most RNAs and proteins is dependent on soluble receptors called karyopherins that can dock at and translocate through the nuclear pore complex. Interaction between cargo and karyopherin β is governed by the GTPase Ran. The asymmetric distribution of the Ran regulatory proteins provides a steep gradient of RanGDP (cytoplasmic)/RanGTP (nuclear) across the nuclear envelope that ensures the directionality of nuclear transport (1Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2721-2727Google Scholar, 2Smith A.E. Slepchenko B.M. Schaff J.C. Loew L.M. Macara I.G. Science. 2002; 295: 488-491Google Scholar). Nuclear import receptors unload their cargo upon binding to RanGTP in the nucleus, whereas RanGTP is used to assemble export complexes which are in turn destabilized by dissociation of RanGTP in the cytoplasm (3Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Google Scholar,4Ossareh-Nazari B. Gwizdek C. Dargemont C. Traffic. 2001; 2: 684-689Google Scholar). Our understanding of the nuclear export of RNAs has been greatly facilitated by the study of viral RNAs. For this reason, we focused our attention on the adenovirus VA1 RNA (VA1), a 160-nt 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotide; PKR, protein kinase R; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; dsRBD, double-stranded RNA binding domains -long RNA transcribed by RNA polymerase III that massively accumulates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. It serves to antagonize the interferon-induced cellular antiviral defense system. Indeed, VA1 binds and inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), which otherwise phosphorylates eIF2α and leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis (5Reichel P.A. Merrick W.C. Siekierka J. Mathews M.B. Nature. 1985; 313: 196-200Google Scholar, 6O'Malley R.P. Mariano T.M. Siekierka J. Mathews M.B. Cell. 1986; 44: 391-400Google Scholar). Adenovirus VA1 RNA contains a new cis-acting RNA export motif that comprises a double-stranded stem (>14 nt) with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3–8-nt protruding 3′ end and that can tolerate some mismatches and bends (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). This export signal, called minihelix, is present not only in VA1 but in a large family of small viral and cellular RNAs transcribed by polymerase III. RNA export mediated by the minihelix motif is Ran-dependent, which indicates the involvement of a karyopherin-related factor (exportin). This exportin is distinct from Crm1 and exportin-t (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol.

Therefore, we sought to identify cellular factors that bind to and mediate the export of minihelix-containing RNAs. VAΔIV, Mut10 mutants, and artificial stems have been described previously (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). VARdm and Mut9 mutants are derived from VAΔIV. VARdm contains a 3′-terminal oligouridine stretch replaced by a UAG sequence. Mut9 presents a 6-base mispairing in the 5′ end. These mutants have been generated by PCR and confirmed by sequencing. In vitro transcription was performed as described previously (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). t-RNA iMet with additional GGG at the 5′ end and a mature 3′ end presents a pseudo-minihelix structure but is exported to the cytoplasm only after the processing of the 5′ end (9Lund E.

EMSA was performed in binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 250 nmMut10 to reduce unspecific binding, in a final sample volume of 20 μl. Recombinant proteins were preincubated with unlabeled competitors for 10 min at room temperature and incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 25 additional minutes. Then, 1 μl of loading DTT-dithiothreitol buffer (0.6 mg ml−1 heparin, 1 mg ml−1 bromphenol blue) was added, and incubation was pursued for another 5 min. Half of each sample was loaded on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was carried out at a constant voltage of 13.3 V cm−1 at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE (45 mm Tris borate, 1 mmEDTA). Oocytes injections and analysis of microinjected RNA by denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography were performed as described previously (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). Stability of competitor VA RNA has been verified previously (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). VA1 consists of three functional domains, an apical stem-loop required for PKR binding, a central domain responsible for PKR inhibition, and a terminal stem, which brings together the 5′ and 3′ ends of the RNA. The 3′ end consists in an unpaired oligouridine stretch characteristic of polymerase III transcripts that not only acts as a transcription termination signal but also as a primary binding site for the La protein. To analyze the role of the oligouridine stretch in the nuclear export of VA RNA, this sequence was replaced by a UAG sequence (Fig. 1 A). Corresponding wild type (VAΔIV) and mutant (VARdm) radiolabeled RNAs were transcribed in vitro and injected intoXenopus oocyte nuclei. Radiolabeled U1 small nuclear RNA with a mutated Sm-binding site (U1ΔSm) and tRNAPhewere co-injected as internal control of exported RNA and U6Δss RNA that is not transported from the nucleus was used as a control of injection. Nucleocytoplasmic distribution of these RNAs was analyzed following a 3-h incubation (Fig. 1 B). As described previously, about 40–50% of VAΔIV was detected in the cytoplasm 3 h after injection (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). In contrast, a complete nuclear export of VARdm was observed in the same experimental conditions. This result indicates that the 3′-oligouridine stretch is not necessary for export of VA1 and rather retains this RNA in the nucleus as it has been previously shown for human Y1 RNA and U6 RNA (11Simons F.H. Rutjes S.A. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 264-273Google Scholar, 12Boelens W.C. Palacios I. Mattaj I.W. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 273-283Google Scholar). Study of the determinant responsible for the cytoplasmic localization of VA1 led to the identification of a new cis-acting RNA export motif within the terminal stem. This structural motif consists in a double-stranded stem (>14 nt) with a base-paired 5′ end and a 3–8-nt protruding 3′ end (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar). We thus used either VA1-derived or artificial RNA containing a functional or altered minihelix structure and tested their ability to compete out the export of VARdm in Xenopusoocyte nuclei. Both VAΔIV and Stem20, which form a terminal stem mimicking that of VA1, efficiently prevented this process (Fig. 1,A and B) but did not affect the nuclear export of U1ΔSm and tRNAPhe, which are exported by Crm1 and exportin-t, respectively. It should be noted that cellular RNA Y1, which also presents a minihelix motif required for its nuclear export, also competes out the transport of VA1 but not tRNA or U1ΔSm (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar, 8Rutjes S.A. Lund E. van der Heijden A. Grimm C. van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 741-752Google Scholar). In contrast, mutant RNAs that display mispairing of the 5′ end (Mut9 and MM3), a shorter stem (Stem12), or no terminal stem (Mut10) poorly interfere with nuclear export (Fig. 1, A and B). The correspondence between the capacity of a given RNA to be exported from the nucleus (7Gwizdek C. Bertrand E. Dargemont C. Lefebvre J.C. Blanchard J.M. Singer R.H. Doglio A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25910-25918Google Scholar) and to inhibit VARdm nuclear export strongly suggested that RNAs containing a minihelix motif utilize a unique, saturable, and structure-dependent nuclear export pathway. We previously reported that RNA export mediated by the minihelix motif is controlled by the GTPase Ran, which indicates the involvement of a karyopherin-related factor (exportin). In addition, we also found that exportin-5, a karyopherin related to human Crm1 and theSaccharomyces cerevisiae Msn5/Kap142p, acts as a nuclear export receptor for proteins containing double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD) (13Brownawell A.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 53-64Google Scholar). Since the structural basis of the minihelix motif corresponds to a double-stranded RNA stem, we tested the ability of exportin-5 to interact with VARdm in a EMSA. No detectable binding of recombinant exportin-5 or RanGTP could be observed on a VARdm probe (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2and 3). In contrast, exportin-5 was able to directly bind VARdm in a RanGTP-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 4 and 5). The specificity of the exportin-5/minihelix interaction was further confirmed by the ability of VARdm and Stem 20 to compete out the formation of this complex (Fig.2 A, lanes 6 and 9), whereas minihelix-derived mutants that are not exported did not interfere with this complex (Fig. 2 A, lanes 7, 8,10, and 11). In agreement with these results, EMSA experiments using either VARdm or Mut9 as probe indicate that exportin-5 interacts better with VARdm than with Mut9 (data not shown). These data clearly indicate that exportin-5 specifically recognizes the minihelix motif, and this interaction is prevented by a 5′ protruding end or limited stem length. We then compared the competition efficiency of VARdm and various cellular RNAs on the exportin-5-VARdm complex. Addition of 1 pmol of unlabelled VARdm already affected the formation of the radiolabeled probe-exportin-5-RanGTP complex that was completely prevented with 50 pmol of VARdm (Fig. 2, B andC). No significant competition could be observed using U1Δsm that do not contain the minihelix motif, and a poor competition was observed using Mut10. hY1 RNA presents a 18-nt-long double-stranded stem with mismaches, a base-paired 5′ end, and a protruding 3′ end, thus corresponding to a minihelix structure less optimal than the VA1. Consistently, 5-fold more hY1 RNA than VARdm were required to compete out the formation of the radiolabeled probe-exportin-5-RanGTP complex. Finally tRNAPhe that contains a highly degenerated minihelix motif displayed a very weak competition effect (Fig. 2,B and C). Similar results were obtained with purified Escherichia coli tRNA than in vitrotranscribed human tRNAPhe. Together, these data indicate that exportin-5 preferentially recognizes minihelix-containing RNAs with affinity varying as a function of the minihelix structure. To determine whether the ability of exportin-5 to interact with minihelix structure in a RanGTP-dependent manner correlates with its ability to mediate the nuclear export of minihelix-containing RNAs, we examined the effect of microinjection of recombinant exportin-5 on the transport of various RNA in Xenopusoocytes (Fig. 3). For this purpose, a mixture of labeled VARdm, U3, U1ΔSm, Mut10, and tRNAMetRNAs were injected into oocyte nuclei following preinjection of control buffer or recombinant exportin-5, and their nucleocytoplasmic distribution was analyzed after short incubation periods (12–30 min). It should be noted that t-RNAMet used in this experiment contained an additional GGG at the 5′ end allowing the formation of a pseudo-minihelix structure 2 nt longer than mature tRNA. This tRNA is normally exported to the cytoplasm only after the processing of the GGG 5′ end (9Lund E. Dahlberg J.E. Science. 1998; 282: 2082-2085Google Scholar, 10Ossareh-Nazari B. Maison C. Black B.E. Levesque L. Paschal B.M. Dargemont C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4562-4571Google Scholar). As shown on Fig. 3, A and B, preinjection of exportin-5 dramatically accelerated VARdm export and weakly stimulates the export of unprocessed tRNA. Importantly, the exportin-5 did not significantly affect the export of other RNAs. Altogether, our results demonstrate that exportin-5 promotes the nuclear export of the viral VA1 RNA. More generally, this exportin appears to specifically interact with the minihelix RNA motif in a RanGTP-dependent manner and is likely responsible for the nuclear transport of viral or cellular RNAs containing such a motif. Based on our results, an optimal exportin-5-interacting minihelix presents a 20-nt-long double-stranded stem with a base-paired 5′ end and a protruding 3′ end. It has been reported recently that exportin-5 is able to stimulate nuclear export of tRNA in microinjectedXenopus oocytes nuclei when transport of endogenous tRNA was artificially saturated (14Calado A. Treichel N. Muller E.C. Otto A. Kutay U. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6216-6224Google Scholar). However, in normal experimental conditions, we found that exportin-5 does not affect tRNA transport. In addition, although exportin-5 can bind tRNA, our results show that its affinity for the optimal minihelix structure is much higher. This strongly suggest that tRNAs, which contain a degenerate minihelix, do not represent a preferential cargo for exportin-5 but can eventually use this transport receptor when their own transport pathway using exportin-t is deficient. Interestingly, the predicted secondary structures of intermediates of the recently discovered class of micro-RNAs and siRNAs resemble the minihelix motif and might mediate their nuclear export by the exportin-5 pathway. In addition, exportin-5 acts as a nuclear export receptor for proteins containing dsRBD. This could occur through an indirect interaction mediated by dsRNA similarly to exportin-5/eEF1A interaction via tRNA (15Bohnsack M.T. Regener K. Schwappach B. Saffrich R. Paraskeva E. Hartmann E. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6205-6215Google Scholar), but one can certainly not exclude that certain dsRBD-containing proteins might participate in the nuclear export of minihelix RNAs. We thank members of the laboratory for helpful and stimulatory discussions and M. Rodriguez, U. Nehrbass, and J. Salamero for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2100804908,"One of the most common forms of functional interaction among transcription factors is the more than additive effect at promoters harboring multiple copies of a response element. The mechanisms that enable or control synergy at such compound response elements are poorly understood. We recently defined a common motif within the negative regulatory regions of multiple factors that operates by regulating their transcriptional synergy. We have identified such a synergy control (SC) motif embedded within the “attenuator domain” of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), a key regulator of energy homeostasis and cellular differentiation. A Lys159 → Arg substitution within the SC motif does not alter C/EBPα activity from a single site but leads to enhanced transactivation from synthetic or natural compound response elements. The sequence of SC motifs overlaps with the recently defined consensus SUMO modification site, and we find that the SC motif is the major site of both SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 modification in C/EBPα. Furthermore, the disruption of SC motif function is accompanied by loss of SUMO but not ubiquitin modification. C/EBPα interacts directly with the E2 SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 and can be SUMOylated in vitro using purified recombinant components. Notably, we find that PIASy has E3-like activity and enhances both SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 modification of C/EBPα in vivo and in vitro. Our results indicate that SUMO modification of SC motifs provides a means to rapidly control higher order interactions among transcription factors and suggests that SUMOylation may be a general mechanism to limit transcriptional synergy.

Our results indicate that SUMO modification of SC motifs provides a means to rapidly control higher order interactions among transcription factors and suggests that SUMOylation may be a general mechanism to limit transcriptional synergy. One of the most pervasive forms of interaction between transcription factors is the synergistic response resulting from the recruitment of an activator to multiple copies of a recognition site (1Yamamoto K.R. Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 587-598Google Scholar, 2Yanofsky C. Mcknight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 3-26Google Scholar). Transcriptional synergy from such compound response elements provides a means to control both the level and specificity of gene expression (3Emami K.H. Carey M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5005-5012Google Scholar), yet the mechanisms by which synergy is controlled are still relatively poorly understood. Through a genetic approach, our laboratory has elucidated the function of a novel protein motif, which limits the transcriptional synergy of DNA binding regulators, including multiple steroid hormone receptors and ETS1 (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). Disruption of these conserved synergy control (SC) 1The abbreviations used are: SC, synergy control; SCF, synergy control factor(s); C/EBP, CAAT/enhancer-binding protein; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; Ub, ubiquitin; WT, wild type; HA, hemagglutinin; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; GST, glutathioneS-transferase motifs dramatically enhances synergistic activation from compound response elements without altering the intrinsic activity from an individual binding site. SC motifs are devoid of activation or repression properties, yet they are both necessary and sufficient to restrict the synergy mediated by a heterologous activation domain (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). We have proposed that SC motifs serve to recruit synergy control factor(s) that directly limit transcriptional synergy (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). Our functional characterization of eight examples of SC motifs in different regulators revealed that the critical features for SC motif function include a branched aliphatic residue at the first position followed by invariant Lys and Glu residues at positions 2 and 4 (see Fig. 1 and Ref. 4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). The core of the motif is preceded and/or followed by Pro residues in a region that often varies in size in different species, suggesting that the motif may lie between secondary structure elements or within a loop that can tolerate insertions (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). In addition to the cases we have examined, matches to our definition of SC motifs occur frequently within documented negative regulatory regions of numerous unrelated transcription factors (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). These seemingly disparate regions may therefore operate via a common mechanism (i.e. synergy control). A striking example is in the CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins (C/EBPs), where C/EBPα and -ε harbor highly conserved SC motifs in previously defined “attenuator” regions (5Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Google Scholar, 6Angerer N.D. Du Y. Nalbant D. Williams S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4147-4154Google Scholar). At least six members of the C/EBP family have been isolated and characterized, C/EBPα to C/EBPζ. They all contain a highly conserved, basic leucine zipper dimerization and DNA binding domain at the C terminus (7Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Google Scholar). Their divergent N-terminal regions contain the transcriptional regulatory domains and specify their diverse activities. Three conserved regions have been identified in C/EBPα, -β, and -ε that are involved in transcriptional activation (8Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Google Scholar). The α-isoform of C/EBP is a central regulator of energy homeostasis (9McKnight S.L. Lane M.D. Gluecksohn-Waelsch S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2021-2024Google Scholar) as it directly activates the transcription of many metabolically important genes (10Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Nizielski S.E. Hakimi P. Cao Z. Moorman A.

Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Google Scholar). Genes regulated by C/EBPα usually harbor multiple binding sites like in the case of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ promoter (19Shi X.M. Blair H.C. Yang X. McDonald J.M. Cao X. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 76: 518-527Google Scholar) or the myeloperoxidase enhancer (20Ford A.M. Bennett C.A. Healy L.E. Towatari M. Greaves M.F. Enver T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10838-10843Google Scholar). C/EBPα often functions synergistically with other transcription factors like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ or PU.1 (21Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Google Scholar, 22Zhang D.E. Hohaus S. Voso M.T. Chen H.M. Smith L.T. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 211: 137-147Google Scholar). For example, cross-regulation between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ and C/EBPα is a key component of the transcriptional control during adipogenesis (23Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Google Scholar, 24Clarke S.L. Robinson C.E. Gimble J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 99-103Google Scholar). Regulatory mechanisms that affect C/EBPα synergy are therefore likely to have a profound impact on its function. We have hypothesized that the function of SC motifs may be regulated through post-translational modification of the critical Lys residue (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar), especially since Arg is not functional at this position. Interestingly, soon after our description of SC motifs, the consensus site for modification by the ubiquitin-like protein SUMO (Fig. 1) came into sharper focus, and it became apparent that our current definition of SC motifs could be viewed as a special case of the more general SUMOylation consensus. SUMOylation is a reversible process that regulates the function of target proteins in a manner akin to phosphorylation. The functional consequences of SUMOylation are poorly understood but do not directly involve targeting for proteasomal degradation (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar). Three different isoforms of SUMO are present in mammals, but whether they subserve different roles is unknown. As in the case of ubiquitination, preparation of SUMO for modification of proteins involves two steps carried by specific E1 activating (SAE1/SAE2) and E2 transfer (UBC9) enzymes. During ubiquitination, a third Ub-ligase or E3 component conveys substrate recognition, often in a signal-regulated manner (26Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Google Scholar,27Jackson P.K. Eldridge A.G. Freed E. Furstenthal L. Hsu J.Y. Kaiser B.K. Reimann J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 429-439Google Scholar). Although SUMOylation can be achieved without an E3 activityin vitro (28Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Google Scholar), recent studies indicate that proteins like RanBP2 (29Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Google Scholar) and members of the PIAS family (30Schmidt D. Muller S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2872-2877Google Scholar, 31Sachdev S. Bruhn L. Sieber H.

Biol. 2002; 22: 5222-5234Google Scholar) can have E3-like activity for SUMO conjugation. In an effort to examine the generality of SC motif function and to explore its mode of action, we have probed the functional significance of the SC motif in C/EBPα and the role of SUMO modification in its function. The pCDNA3-based expression plasmid for the p42 form of mouse C/EBPα was provided by Dr. Ormond MacDougald and is described in Ref. 33Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Google Scholar. This plasmid (pCDNA3 p42) contains engineered silent restriction sites for ease of manipulation. The K159R substitution was generated by PCR and then transferred to p42 as a 538-bp XhoI/KpnI fragment (pCDNA3 p42 K159R). The C-terminal region of p42 was amplified with primers 5′-CGCAACAGAAGGTGCTCGAGTTGACCAGTGACAAT-3′ and 5′-CTAGAAGCTTCTAA TGATGATGGTGGTGATGGTCGACCGCGCAGTTGCCCATGGCCTTG ACC-3′ to add a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and transferred into theXhoI and Hind III sites of the WT and K159R p42 plasmids (pCDNA3 p42 His and pCDNA3 p42 K159R His). The pCDNA3 HA SUMO-1, pCDNA3 HA SUMO-3, and pCDNA3 HA ubiquitin were kind gifts of Dr. Kim Orth (University of Texas Southwestern), and the pCMVFLAG PIASy plasmid was a kind gift of Dr. Tae-Hwa Chun (University of Michigan). The pΔODLO 02 parental vector contains a polylinker upstream of a minimal Drosophila alcohol dehydrogenase promoter (adh −33 to +53) and the luciferase gene. The oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCTGATTGCGCAATCGA-3′ and 5′-GATCTCGATTGCGCAATCAG-3′, containing a single consensus C/EBP site, were annealed and ligated into the BamHI andBglII sites of pΔODLO 02 to yield pΔ(CAAT)1-Luc. Ligation of BseRI/BglII andBamHI/BseRI fragments of the same vector yielded pΔ(CAAT)2-Luc. The same procedure using pΔ(CAAT)2-Luc yielded pΔ(CAAT)4-Luc. The pΔTAT glucocorticoid response units reporter consists of a fusion of 668- and 300-bp fragments corresponding to the −5.5 and −2.5 kb glucocorticoid response units of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene (34Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 131-139Google Scholar) inserted at theBamHI and BglII sites of pΔODLO 02. The human Ubc9 coding sequence was amplified with primers 5′-GCTACGGATCCATGAGTGAGATCGCCCTCAGCAGACTCGCCCAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGTGCCTTGGCCCCAAG TCCGGTGGTGGTGGTGGAATTCAAAGATC-3′, digested withBamHI and EcoRI, and transferred to the same sites of the pGEX-KG vector (35Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar) to yield pGEX-hUbc9. The expression vectors for His SUMO-1GG, in which the last 4 residues of SUMO-1 have been deleted, and GST-Ulp1 were kind gifts of Dr. Kim Orth. The expression vector for bicistronic expression of GST SAE2 and SAE1 (28Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Kemp G.D. Hay R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10618-10624Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Dr. R. T. Hay. The sequences of all of the constructed plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were transfected by liposome-mediated transfection using LipofectAMINE and Plus reagent (Invitrogen). In all cases, cells received equimolar amounts of each type of expression plasmid to control for promoter effects. For functional assays, 5 × 103 cells were seeded into 96-well plates and transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids, 30 ng of the indicated reporter plasmid, and 10 ng of the control pRSVβgal plasmid (36Pearce D. Yamamoto K.R. Science. 1993; 259: 1161-1165Google Scholar). The total amount of DNA was supplemented to 70 ng/well with pBSKS (−). Cells were lysed 36 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (37Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Lou D.Y. Yamamoto K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4149-4156Google Scholar). For SUMOylation/ubiquitination experiments, 2 × 106 cells were seeded in 10-cm plates and transfected with the indicated amounts of expression plasmids. Cells were harvested 36 h post-transfection in 0.7 ml of urea lysis buffer (8m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 45 mmNa2HPO4, 5 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole, Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/10 ml) (pH 8.0)) and sonicated. For ubiquitination experiments, the cells were treated with 10 μm lactacystin for 1 h before harvest with urea lysis buffer. Lysates were incubated with 0.1 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at room temperature in a rotator. The resin was washed three times with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer 1 (8 m urea, 0.4 m NaCl, 17.6 mm Na2HPO4, 32.4 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm imidazole (pH 6.75)) and three times with 10 bed volumes of wash buffer 2 (buffer 1 with 150 mm NaCl and no urea). Examination of the supernatants revealed that the binding is quantitative under these conditions. For Ulp1 treatment, beads were incubated with 3.5 μg of purified GST or GST-Ulp1 for 60 min at 30 °C. Proteins were eluted by incubating at 90 °C in elution buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 500 mm imidazole, 0.015% bromphenol blue, 10 mm dithiothreitol), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting. Membranes (Immobilon) were incubated with goat polyclonal anti-C/EBPα IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) or monoclonal HA 11 anti IgG (Covance) or monoclonal anti-FLAG IgG (Sigma). Anti-goat IgG peroxidase conjugate (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies, and visualization was with Super Signal West Femto substrates (Pierce). Images were captured with an Eastman Kodak Co. Image Station 440 CF. All of the experiments were performed at least twice with similar results. BL21 DE3-CodonPlus cells harboring the pGEX-hUbc9 or pGEX-SAE2/SAE1 expression vector and BLR (DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen) containing pGEX-Ulp1 or pT7His SUMO-1GG were grown at 37 °C in LB medium containing carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline (50 μg/ml, 25 μg/ml, and 12 μg/ml). Cultures (1 liter;A 600 = 0.8) were induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h at 37 °C. Cells were centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For GST fusion proteins, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/10 ml)). After lysozyme treatment (40 μg/ml for 30 min) and sonication at 4 °C, the suspension was centrifuged at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated with 2 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) for 60 min at 24 °C. The matrix was washed (4 °C) with 10 bed volumes of buffer A without protease inhibitors and with 10 bed volumes of buffer B (buffer A with 400 mm NaCl). Proteins were eluted in buffer B (24 °C) supplemented with 20 mmreduced glutathione. For His SUMO-1GG, cells were resuspended and lysed in buffer C (50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol 10 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/10 ml)). Incubation of the extract was with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA resin (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 10 bed volumes of buffer C, followed by 2 bed volumes of buffer C containing 20 mmimidazole. Protein was eluted in buffer C containing 250 mmimidazole. All proteins were exchanged into buffer D (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) via gel filtration and stored at −80 °C. For immunopurification of PIASy, COS-7 cells were maintained and transiently transfected in 10-cm plates as described above for 293T cells with 10 μg of expression plasmid, pCMVFLAG-PIASy, or the empty pCMV FLAG. Cells were harvested after 36 h in Buffer E (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, Complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture tablets (1 tablet/10 ml)). The extracts were incubated with 50 μg of anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were recovered using 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) and washed three times in buffer E with 200 mm NaCl and twice in 50 mmTris (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2. Proteins were translated in vitro using the T7-TNT Quick Coupled Transcription-Translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine using the pCDNA3 p42, pCDNA3 p42 K159R, or control T7 Luc (Promega) plasmids as templates. Binding reactions (50 μl) were carried out at 4 °C for 1 h and contained 1.2 nmol of purified GST or GST-hUBC9 fusion proteins bound to 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) and 10 μl of 35S-labeled proteins in a binding buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The resin was washed four times with 1 ml of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline. The beads and 2 μl of the corresponding load were boiled in a final volume of 40 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and 25% of the samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were fixed in 45% methanol, 10% acetic acid and dried, and radioactive proteins were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro SUMOylation reactions (20 μl) were assembled on ice in 50 mm Tris, 5 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.5) and contained 1 μg of GST SAE2/SAE1, 5 or 0.5 μg of GST hUBC9, 5 μg of His-SUMO-1GG, 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled p42 C/EBPα WT or K159R, and 10 μl of control or PIASy-containing beads as indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of an ATP regeneration system (10 units/ml creatine kinase, 25 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mmATP final concentrations) and pyrophosphatase (0.6 units/ml final concentration) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. Disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.67% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.24 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) was added to terminate the reaction. The samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and dried, and the radioactive proteins were visualized in a PhosphorImager. All of the results were confirmed in at least two independent experiments. Mining of the Swiss-Prot protein data base for the occurrence of SC motifs allowed us to identify a number of transcription factors that harbor conserved SC motifs. For several of them, like the progesterone receptor, Sp3, C/EBPα, C/EBPε and c-Myb, the motifs reside in demonstrated negative regulatory regions (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). In the case of C/EBPα, the SC motif lies within an “attenuator” domain (5Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Google Scholar). By comparing multiple sequences from distantly related vertebrates, we find that the SC motif in C/EBPα constitutes a highly conserved small stretch surrounded by regions of lower conservation (see Fig.1 A). This suggests an evolutionary pressure for the preservation of this sequence and the function it subserves. To assess whether the SC motif in C/EBPα functions by inhibiting transcriptional synergy, we replaced the predicted critical lysine at position 159 with arginine. This substitution inactivates SC motif function in all of the cases we have examined (4Iñiguez-Lluhı́ J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Google Scholar). We then compared the activity of the WT and mutant proteins at promoters harboring zero, one, two, or four C/EBPα sites. We chose 293T cells, since they do not contain endogenous C/EBPα (38Erickson R.L. Hemati N. Ross S.E. MacDougald O.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16348-16355Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig.1 B, WT C/EBPα activates the reporter with a single binding site by 10-fold. Adding a second site enhances the activity only 2.8-fold, and adding two more sites does not significantly increase transcription. These results indicate that the ability of C/EBPα to engage in synergistic interactions is limited. The K159R mutant is indistinguishable from the WT at a single site. However, the activity of the mutant at the reporters with two and four sites is ∼6- and 14-fold higher than that at a single site. This translates to a 2.5- and 5-fold higher activity of the mutant versus the WT protein at these reporters. Thus, disruption of the SC motif leads to enhanced transcriptional synergy, indicating that its normal function is to restrict the potential of C/EBPα to synergize but without affecting its intrinsic transactivation potential. Similar results were obtained in CV-1 cells (not shown). Importantly, we also observed a 5-fold higher activity of the mutant C/EBPα from a reporter driven by the natural enhancer regions of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase gene, which harbor multiple C/EBPα sites (see Fig. 1 B,right) (34Grange T. Roux J. Rigaud G. Pictet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 131-139Google Scholar). This indicates that the effect is not restricted to synthetic promoters. Consistent with their comparable activities at a single site, Western blot analysis indicated that the WT and mutant proteins are expressed at equivalent levels (not shown). Furthermore, similar results were observed at both higher and lower amounts of plasmid, ruling out preferential squelching effects (not shown). Taken together, these results confirm our assignment of this region of C/EBPα as a functional synergy control motif and argue that the SC motif is responsible for the described “attenuator” property of this region (5Pei D.Q. Shih C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1480-1487Google Scholar). Our sequence definition of SC motifs, which is based purely on functional effects, can be viewed as a subset of the more general SUMO modification consensus (Fig. 1 A). Therefore, we tested whether the SC motif in C/EBPα can be modified by SUMO isoforms in vivo. To this end, we co-transfected 293T cells with expression vectors for His-tagged WT and mutant C/EBPα forms with vectors for HA-tagged SUMO-1 or SUMO-3. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions to protect SUMOylated proteins from isopeptidases. His-tagged C/EBPα forms were purified via metal chelate chromatography, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted. As can be seen in Fig. 2, when WT C/EBPα is coexpressed with HA-SUMO-1 or HA-SUMO-3, we can detect ∼91-kDa HA immunoreactive bands corresponding to HA SUMO-1- and HA SUMO-3-modified C/EBPα. The SUMO-3-modified form migrates slightly faster than the SUMO-1 counterpart, presumably due to the smaller size of SUMO-3versus SUMO-1. As is the case for other SUMO-modified proteins, the migration of modified forms is slower than that expected for their molecular sizes. The slower migrating species can also be detected as a minor band in the anti C/EBP blot for both SUMO-1 and SUMO-3. As in the case of other targets (25Muller S. Hoege C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 202-210Google Scholar), relative quantitation revealed that less than 5% of the total C/EBPα is modified by either SUMO isoform. This may reflect the transient and reversible nature of this modification. Notably, these slower migrating forms were completely absent in the case of the K159R mutant, although its expression is indistinguishable from that of the WT protein. Comparable results were obtained in COS-7 cells. These results show that C/EBPα is modified in vivo by SUMO-1 or SUMO-3 and argue strongly that the SC motif is the main target for SUMO modification in C/EBPα. Moreover, the fact that the K159R mutation disrupts both SC motif function and SUMOylation implies that this modification is key for SC motif function. The yeast ubiquitin-like protein specific protease 1 (Ulp1) deconjugates SUMO from the lysine ε-amino group of modified proteins (39Li S.J. Hochstrasser M. Nature. 1999; 398: 246-251Google Scholar). This deconjugase activity is specific for SUMO versus ubiquitin. To confirm that the higher order species of C/EBPα that we observe is a SUMO-modified form, we treated the purified C/EBPα preparations with GST alone or with GST-Ulp1 (Fig. 3). In contrast to the GST treatment, we did not observe HA immunoreactive bands at ∼91 kDa in SUMO-1 or SUMO-3 samples treated with GST-Ulp1. Instead, we saw a species of ∼24 kDa corresponding to free SUMO. Ulp1 did not display nonspecific protease activity, since the unmodified C/EBPα protein was not affected by the treatment. These results suggest that C/EBPα can be modified by SUMO-1 and SUMO-3 and that Ulp1 can remove either SUMO isoform from C/EBPα. Although the cleavage of SUMO-1 from substrates by Ulp1 is well established, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that SUMO-3-modified proteins can also be deconjugated by this yeast enzyme. Both ubiquitin and SUMO are linked to proteins through Lys residues, and in the case of IκB, both modifications appear to occur at the same site (40Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Google Scholar). Desterro et al. (40Desterro J.M. Rodriguez M.S. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 233-239Google Scholar) proposed that SUMO modification of IκB prevents its ubiquitination and therefore contributes to the stabilization of this protein. We therefore explored whether C/EBPα is ubiquitinated and, if so, whether disruption of the SC motif alters this modification. We used the same experimental paradigm as for SUMO modification and treated the cells with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin to allow the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. As can be seen in the HA immunoblot in Fig. 4, we can detect mono- and polyubiquitinated forms of C/EBPα. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that C/EBPα is ubiquitinated. Notably, we observed an identical pattern using the K159R mutant. These results clearly indicate that although ubiquitina"

Group I (mGlu1 and -5) receptors are coupled to the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis; group II (mGlu2 and -3) and group III receptors (mGlu4, -6, -7, and -8) are negatively coupled to cAMP production (1Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Google Scholar, 2Pin J.P. De Colle C. Bessis A.S. Acher F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 375: 277-294Google Scholar, 3De Blasi A. Conn P.J. Pin J.P. Nicoletti F. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 114-120Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated the involvement of mGlu receptors in the modulation of synaptic transmission, ion channel activity, and synaptic plasticity (4Holscher C. Gigg J. O'Mara S.M. Neurosci. Biobehav. Rev. 1999; 23: 399-410Google Scholar, 5Nakanishi S. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1031-1037Google Scholar), and dysfunction of these receptors has been implicated in psychiatric and neurological diseases (6Bordi F. Ugolini A. Prog. Neurobiol. 1999; 59: 55-79Google Scholar). The mGlu receptors belong to the family 3 of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Other members of this family include the GABAB, Ca2+-sensing, vomeronasal, pheromone, and putative taste receptors (7Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Google Scholar). The family 3 GPCRs shares a low sequence similarity with the other families. In contrast to family 1, the family 3 receptors are characterized by two distinctly separated topological domains: an exceptionally long extracellular amino-terminal domain (500–600 amino acids), which forms the agonist-binding pocket (8O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Google Scholar, 9Galvez T. Prezeau L. Milioti G. Franek M.

Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar), and the 7TM helical segments involved in receptor activation and G-protein coupling (11Parmentier M.L. Prezeau L. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2002; 23: 268-274Google Scholar). Compounds acting at group I mGlu receptors can be grouped into two categories. Category one comprises competitive agonists and antagonists. These compounds are phenylglycine derivatives or rigidified analogs of glutamate (12Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Google Scholar), which logically bind to the glutamate-binding domain. Competitive group I ligands have achieved only limited subtype selectivity and potency, perhaps due to the high sequence homology of the mGlu receptor family agonist-binding site supported by the three-dimensional structure of mGlu1 amino-terminal domain (10Kunishima N. Shimada Y. Tsuji Y. Sato T. Yamamoto M. Kumasaka T. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. Morikawa K. Nature. 2000; 407: 971-977Google Scholar). However, recent development of more sensitive technologies for functional screening of GPCRs has resulted in the discovery of a second category of compounds. These novel compounds, which interact within the 7TMD of group I mGlu receptor, act as positive or negative allosteric modulators (13Gasparini F. Kuhn R. Pin J.P. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 43-49Google Scholar). CPCCOEt was the first non-amino acid derivative, subtype-selective antagonist of the mGlu1 receptor (IC50 = 6.5 μm at hmGlu1b) to be described (14Annoura H. Fukunaga A. Uesugi M. Tatsuoka T. Horikawa Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 763-766Google Scholar). Litschig et al. (15Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461Google Scholar) elucidated the site of action of CPCCOEt, which binds within the 7TMD of mGlu1, in close contact with the residues Thr-815 and Ala-818 of TM7. Similarly, methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), which was the first noncompetitive, highly potent, mGlu5-selective antagonist (IC50 = 36 nm at hmGlu5a) to be described (16Gasparini F. Lingenhohl K. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Heinrich M. Vranesic I. Biollaz M. Allgeier H. Heckendorn R. Urwyler S. Varney M.A. Johnson E.C. Hess S.D. Rao S.P. Sacaan A.I. Santori E.M. Velicelebi G. Kuhn R. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1493-1503Google Scholar), was suggested to make close contact with the amino acid residues Ala-810 in TM7 and Pro-655 and Ser-658 in TM3 of the mGlu5 receptor. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the CPCCOEt and MPEP interact with residues that appear to form overlapping binding pockets in homologous regions of the 7TMD of the mGlu1 and -5 receptors, respectively (17Pagano A. Ruegg D. Litschig S. Stoehr N. Stierlin C. Heinrich M. Floersheim P. Prezeau L. Carroll F. Pin J.P. Cambria A. Vranesic I. Flor P.J. Gasparini F. Kuhn R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33750-33758Google Scholar). Recently, BAY36-7620, another highly potent mGlu1-selective antagonist (IC50 = 160 nm at rmGlu1a) that interacts within the 7TMD, has been reported (18Carroll F.Y. Stolle A. Beart P.M. Voerste A.

Interestingly, their binding pocket appears to be also located within the 7TMD of mGlu1. Furthermore, the mutational analysis revealed (19Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P.

The position of each amino acid residue in the 7TMD of mGlu receptor is identified both by its sequence number (including the signal peptide) and by the generic numbering system proposed by Ballesteros and Weinstein (24Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Google Scholar) which is shown as superscript. In this numbering system, amino acid residues in the 7TMD are given two numbers; the first refers to the TM number, and the second indicates its position relative to a highly conserved residue of family 1 GPCRs in that TM which is arbitrarily assigned 50. The amino acids in the extracellular loop EC2 are labeled 45 to indicate their location between the helix 4 and 5. The highly conserved cysteine, thought to be disulfide-bonded, is given the index number 45.50 (SWISS-PROT: opsd_bovin C187), and the residues within the EC2 are then indexed relative to the “50” position. An alignment of the seven-transmembrane helices of rmGlu1 toward the transmembrane helices of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1f88) were obtained with help of our in-house program Xsae, 2C. Broger, unpublished work. using a modified version of ClustalV (25Higgins D.C. Bleasby A.J. Fuch R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1992; 8: 189-191Google Scholar). Sequences were obtained from SWISS-PROT: rmGlu1, P23385. The sequence of bovine rhodopsin was read directly from the rhodopsin structure (Protein Data Bank code 1f88). All modeling calculations were made on a Silicon Graphics Octane with a single R12000 processor using our in-house modeling package Moloc (26Gerber P.R. Muller K. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1995; 9: 251-268Google Scholar, 27Gerber P.R. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1998; 12: 37-51Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web at www.Moloc.ch). An initial C-α model of rat mGlu1 was built by fitting the aligned rmGlu1 sequence lacking the extracellular domain on the bovine rhodopsin template C-α structure. Loops were optimized with the Moloc C-α force field. In a next step, a full atom model was generated. φ and ψ angles were obtained for aligned amino acids from the rhodopsin template. χ angles were also adopted from the bovine rhodopsin structure where possible or in case of nonidentical amino acids generated by using the most probable value applying the Ponder-Richards method (28Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Google Scholar). An energy calculation of the initial full peptide structure revealed regions with bad van der Waals contacts of amino acid side chains that were subsequently improved by manually adjusting the relevant χ angles. Repulsive van der Waals interactions were removed manually where necessary. Refinement of the model was done by keeping all backbone atoms in fixed positions and allowing only the side chains to move. In a following optimization step, only C-α atoms were kept in a fixed position while all other atoms were allowed to move. In a third round of optimization, no atoms were kept stationary, but constraints were applied to C-α atoms. The quality of the model was then checked with Moloc internal programs. EM-TBPC was manually docked into the 7TMD region taking cis-retinal as template for location. Where necessary, nonconserved amino acid side chains in the rmGlu1 model were rotated such that no van der Waals conflicts with the antagonist occurred. All amino acid side chains reaching within a 6-Å distance of the antagonist were subsequently included in a round of optimization. cDNAs encoding the rmGlu1a and rmGlu5a receptors in pBlueScript II were obtained from Prof. S. Nakanishi (Kyoto, Japan). hmGlu1a receptor cDNA was amplified from a human fetal brain cDNA library in pCMV.SPORT2 (Invitrogen) using primers derived from the hmGlu1a sequence (AC:U31216). All point mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The entire coding regions of all point mutants were sequenced from both strands using an automated cycle sequencer (Applied Biosystems). HEK-293 cells were transfected as previously described (29Malherbe P. Knoflach F. Broger C. Ohresser S. Kratzeisen C. Adam G. Stadler H. Kemp J.A. Mutel V. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 944-954Google Scholar). 48 h posttransfection, the cells were harvested and washed three times with cold PBS and frozen at −80 °C. The pellet was suspended in cold 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) and homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica, AG) for 10 s at 10,000 rpm. After centrifugation at 48,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in cold 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), homogenized, and respun as above. The pellet was resuspended in a smaller volume of a cold 20 mm HEPES-NaOH buffer containing 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). After homogenization for 10 s at 10,000 rpm, the protein content was measured using the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. The membrane homogenate was frozen at −80 °C before use. After thawing, the membrane homogenates were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellets were resuspended in the 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4) binding buffer to a final assay concentration of 20 μg of protein/ml. Saturation isotherms were determined by the addition of various [3H]EM-TBPC concentrations (0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 nm) to these membranes for 1 h at room temperature (equilibrium binding conditions determined in kinetic experiments). At the end of the incubation, membranes were filtered onto Filtermate (unitfilter Packard: 96-well white microplate with bonded GF/B filter preincubated 1 h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine) and washed three times with cold binding buffer. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 100 μm CFBTE-TPC, a noncompetitive, subtype-selective antagonist of mGlu1 with K i = 390 nm, which is a compound from the same class as EM-TBPC, Fig. 1 (21.Adam, G., Binggeli, A., Maerki, H. P., Mutel, V., Wilhelm, M., and Wostl, W. (2001) European Patent Application, pp. 1–85, Priority EP 99–1074549 A2.Google Scholar). The radioactivity on the filter was counted on a Packard Top-count microplate scintillation counter with quenching correction after the addition of 40 μl of microscint 40 (Canberra Packard S.A.). Saturation experiments were analyzed by Prism 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using the rectangular hyperbolic equation derived from the equation of a bimolecular reaction and the law of mass action,B = (B max * [F])/(K D + [F]), where B is the amount of ligand bound at equilibrium, B max is the maximum number of binding sites, [F] is the concentration of free ligand, and K D is the ligand dissociation constant. The experiments were performed three times in triplicate, and the mean ± S.D. of the individual K D values were calculated and are reported in Table I. [3H]Quisqualate binding was performed as previously described (30Mutel V. Ellis G.J. Adam G. Chaboz S. Nilly A. Messer J. Bleuel Z. Metzler V. Malherbe P. Schlaeger E.-J. Roughley B.S. Faull R.L.M.

After 24 h, the cells were co-transfected with a 2:1 (w/w) mixture of mGlu/enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). 48 h later, the transfected cells were incubated with 20 μm fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester plus 0.5% Pluronic F-127 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 40 min at room temperature with 20-min postincubation in balanced salt solution. Cells were stimulated at room temperature in artificial cerebrospinal fluid with drug as indicated. Glutamate applications (drug + 30 μm glutamate, 30-s exposure) were separated by 10-min intervals (3-min wash, 7-min antagonist incubation). Imaging measurements were made on an inverted microscope with a long distance ×40 objective (Axiovert 405M; Zeiss). A cooled CCD camera (CH-250; Photometrics) was used to acquire image pairs at 340- and 380-nm excitation wavelengths (with dark correction) to a computer. Exposure times were 400 ms. The intrinsic fluorescence in cells not dye-loaded was less than 5% and did not contribute a significant error to the measurements. Fluorescence ratio values were calculated as previously described (31Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Google Scholar). Inhibition curves were fitted according to the Hill equation: y = 100/(1 + (x/IC50)nH), wheren H represents slope factor. A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line stably expressing human GIRK1-GIRK2c dimer was co-transfected with a 1:1 (w/w) mixture of mGlu/enhanced green fluorescent protein plasmids using LipofectAMINE 2000. GIRK channel currents were recorded 24–96 h after transfection using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique as described previously (19Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Google Scholar). Briefly, for GIRK current recordings, the pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 5 mmK4BAPTA, 3 mm Na2ATP, 0.3 mm Na2GTP, adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH, and osmolarity was adjusted to 310 mosm with sucrose. The drug was applied locally to the cell by fast perfusion from a double-barreled pipette assembly. The rate of solution exchange was around 20 ms. The CHO cells were held at −70 mV, and the recordings were made under conditions in which K+ currents would be inward ([K+]i = 150 mm, [K+]o = 30 mm). Concentration-response curves were obtained by applying 20-s pulses of varying concentrations of the compound every 90 s to the cells. [3H]EM-TBPC, 1-ethyl-2-methyl-6-oxo-4-(1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d]azepin-3-yl)-1,6-dihydro-pyrimidine-5-carbonitrile (Fig. 1) is a highly potent, subtype-selective, noncompetitive antagonist that binds only to rat mGlu1 (K D = 6.6 ± 0.5 nm,K i = 11 ± 2 nm). It has a low affinity for human mGlu1 and none for the rat mGlu5 (22Knoflach F. Mutel V. Kew J.N.C. Waselle L. Vieira E. Jolidon S. Wichmann J. Malherbe P. Kemp J.A. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 2001; 705: 13Google Scholar). Using a series of chimeric rmGlu1/5a and rmGlu5/1α receptors (19Knoflach F. Mutel V. Jolidon S. Kew J.N.C. Malherbe P. Vieira E. Wichmann J. Kemp J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13402-13407Google Scholar), the binding pocket of EM-TBPC has been localized to the 7TMD of mGlu1 (data not shown). To elucidate the binding mode of EM-TBPC further, an alignment of the seven-transmembrane helices of the whole rmGlu family toward the transmembrane helices of bovine rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank code 1f88) was made. The inverse agonist of rhodopsin,cis-retinal, was employed as a template for the location of EM-TBPC. Amino acids in mGlu1 located within 6.0 Å away from retinal in the x-ray crystal structure of rhodopsin (23Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar, 32Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Google Scholar) were considered as likely candidates to affect binding of EM-TBPC. In Fig.2, the alignment of these amino acids of the rmGlu1 and the rmGlu family with rhodopsin is shown. From this preselection, amino acids in the TM3, -4, -5, -6, and -7 and EC2 regions (Fig. 2, boldface type) were chosen for the mutational studies. 20 mutations (19 in rmGlu1α and 1 in hmGlu1α) were accordingly introduced in the 7TMD region by site-directed mutagenesis. Saturation binding analyses were performed on membranes isolated from the HEK-293 transfected with the WT and mutated receptors using 0.3–300 nm of [3H]EM-TBPC. The dissociation constants (K D) derived from the saturation isotherms are given in Table I. Eleven mutations, A699V, Y672F, T723, N747A, S749T, S749A, N750A, N750Q, V802M, A818S, and A818I, did not significantly affect the [3H]EM-TBPC affinity compared with the WT rmGlu1α receptor (Table I). Three mutations, F801A, Y805A, and T815M, completely abolished [3H]EM-TBPC binding, and the mutation Y672V led to a 5-fold decrease in affinity (K D = 32 ± 5.4 nm). [3H]EM-TBPC does not bind to hmGlu1 under our experimental conditions (Table I). Interestingly, only one amino acid differs between the rat and human receptor in the TM domain; it is a valine at position 757 in the rat and a leucine in the human receptor. As expected, the replacement of the leucine residue at position 757 of the hmGlu1 receptor by a valine (L757V) gave to the mutant receptor a binding affinity for [3H]EM-TBPC comparable with that of WT rmGlu1α (K D = 9.9 ± 2.9 nm for the hmGlu1α L757V versus6.6 ± 0.5 nm rmGlu1α). Conversely, the replacement of the valine 757 with a leucine (V757L) or an alanine (V757A) led to a dramatic, although not complete, reduction in [3H]EM-TBPC affinity by 13-fold (K D = 84 ± 39 nm and K D = 85 ± 19 nm), respectively, in both mutants. Finally, the conversion of the tryptophan 798 to a phenylalanine (W798F) or a tyrosine (W798Y) significantly increased the binding affinity of the radioligand by 10- and 5-fold (K D = 0.7 ± 0.2 nm and K D = 1.3 ± 0.2 nm), respectively. In order to examine effects of the mutations on the glutamate binding pocket and to check for receptor expression, saturation analyses were performed on membranes from selected mutated receptors using [3H]quisqualate. The K D values and maximum number of binding sites (B max) derived from the saturation isotherms are given in Table I. As seen, the mutations have no significant effect on quisqualate affinity, and the level of receptor expression was comparable even with mutants that completely lost the antagonist binding (Table I). In HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with rmGlu1α receptors, glutamate elicited a concentration-dependent increase in intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i, as assayed by single-cell fura-2 imaging (EC50 = 6.8 μm). All mutated receptors elicit an increase in [Ca2+]i response upon application of 30 μm glutamate, indicating the presence of functional receptors. However, co-application of EM-TBPC at various concentrations with 30 μm glutamate in the cells expressing WT rmGlu1α resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of glutamate-evoked [Ca2+]i response with IC50 = 128 nm (Fig. 3). The concentration-dependent inhibition of glutamate-evoked increases in [Ca2+]i by EM-TBPC in the cells expressing various mutated receptors is shown in Fig. 3, Aand B, and their derived IC50 andn H values are shown in TableII.Table IIEffect of mutations on inhibition of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i response by EM-TBPCReceptorPosition in the 7TMDIC50 ± S.E.n HnmrmGlu1αWT128 ± 141.2N747A45.5131 ± 50.8N750A45.5410 ± 40.6V757L5.471160 ± 1301.9W798F6.484 ± 0.41.3Y805A6.55>10,000T815M7.39>10,000A818S7.42101 ± 281IC50 and Hill coefficient (n H) values for the inhibition by EM-TBPC of glutamate-evoked [Ca2+]i response in the HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with the mGlu1α WT and mutated receptors.

As expected from the binding studies, the antagonist inhibition of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i response was not affected by the mutation A818S. In cells expressing the mutants Y805A and T815M, which did not bind [3H]EM-TBPC, EM-TBPC was not able to efficiently inhibit glutamate-evoked [Ca2+]i response and thus resulted in the large increases in IC50 values (>10,000 nm for Y805A and T815M).

Recently, we demonstrated that LRP5 is also required for normal cholesterol metabolism and glucose-induced insulin secretion. To further define the role of LRP5 in the lipoprotein metabolism, we compared plasma lipoproteins in mice lacking LRP5, apolipoprotein E (apoE), or both (apoE;LRP5 double knockout). On a normal chow diet, the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice (older than 4 months of age) had ∼60% higher plasma cholesterol levels compared with the age-matched apoE knockout mice. In contrast, LRP5 deficiency alone had no significant effects on the plasma cholesterol levels. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma lipoproteins revealed that cholesterol levels in the very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein fractions were markedly increased in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. There were no apparent differences in the pattern of apoproteins between the apoE knockout mice and the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. The plasma clearance of intragastrically loaded triglyceride was markedly impaired by LRP5 deficiency. The atherosclerotic lesions of the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice aged 6 months were ∼3-fold greater than those in the age-matched apoE-knockout mice. Furthermore, histological examination revealed highly advanced arthrosclerosis, with remarkable accumulation of foam cells and destruction of the internal elastic lamina in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. These data suggest that LRP5 mediates both apoE-dependent and apoE-independent catabolism of plasma lipoproteins.

Cell. 2001; 7: 801-809Google Scholar), our data indicated that LRP5 is a multifunctional receptor physiologically linked to common human disorders, including hypercholesterolemia and impaired glucose tolerance.To further define the role of LRP5 in lipoprotein metabolism, we produced double knockout mice that are deficient in apoE as well as in LRP5 (apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice). In the current paper, we describe that superimposition of an LRP5 deficiency onto apoE deficiency increased plasma cholesterol beyond the level observed with apoE deficiency alone. We also show that fat tolerance was markedly impaired in the LRP5 knockout mice as well as in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. Consistent with extreme hypercholesterolemia, severe atherosclerosis developed in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. These results provide further evidence for the role of LRP5 in the catabolism of plasma lipoproteins.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show extreme hypercholesterolemia in mice lacking both apoE and LRP5. It has been well established that both LDLR and apoE are critical in the plasma clearance of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins, including LDL and apoE-containing intermediate density lipoprotein and chylomicron remnants (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.J. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1991; 265: 78-83Google Scholar). In contrast to the mice lacking apoE (3Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Google Scholar, 4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L.

Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar), the lack of LRP5 alone did not increase the plasma levels of cholesterol on a normal diet, whereas high fat feeding results in hypercholesterolemia in the LRP5 knockout mice (22Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M. Murase T. Kamataki A. Yamamoto J. Magoori K. Takahashi S. Miyamoto Y. Oishi H. Nose M. Okazaki M. Usui S. Imaizumi K. Yanagisawa M. Sakai J. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 229-234Google Scholar). Ishibashi et al. (27Ishibashi S. Herz J. Maeda N. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar) showed that the plasma cholesterol levels in the double knockout mice lacking both apoE and LDLR were not significantly different from the levels in the apoE knockout mice. The severe hypercholesterolemia developed in the double knockout mice lacking both apoE and LRP5 suggests the presence of an alternative pathway for cholesterol catabolism mediated by LRP5, which appears to be independent of the LDLR pathway.Consistent with the previous work (22Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M. Murase T. Kamataki A. Yamamoto J. Magoori K. Takahashi S. Miyamoto Y. Oishi H. Nose M. Okazaki M. Usui S. Imaizumi K. Yanagisawa M. Sakai J. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 229-234Google Scholar), the LRP5 knockout mice and the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice displayed markedly impaired fat tolerance. In contrast, the plasma clearance of intragastrically loaded triglyceride was not significantly impaired in the apoE-knockout mice. These observations suggest that LRP5 modulates the plasma clearance of diet-derived triglycerides in the absence of apoE by stimulating the hydrolysis of triglycerides. In this context, it is important to note that LRP5 and LRP6 can bind Dickkopf (Dkk), an antagonist of Wnt proteins (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Google Scholar, 24Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Google Scholar). Dkk is involved in Xenopus head formation and the impaired action of Dkk at LRP5 increases bone density in humans (24Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Google Scholar). The Dkk sequence consists of two cysteine-rich domains. The C-terminal domain has the typical cysteine pattern of colipase, which is required by pancreatic lipase for the efficient lipid hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 28van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of colipase binds to the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of pancreatic lipase, which is thought to stabilize an active conformation of the lipase, and is also conserved among various lipases, including hepatic and lipoprotein lipases. Detailed sequence analysis and molecular modeling of the Dkk sequence onto the colipase structure suggest that Dkk and colipase have the same disulfide pattern and very similar three-dimensional structures (28van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Google Scholar). This structural analogy implies a common function (lipid interaction) and raises the possibility that Dkk bound to LRP5 stimulates lipid hydrolysis by interacting with hepatic lipase and/or lipoprotein lipase. Furthermore, the impaired fat tolerance caused by the deficiency of LRP5 may lead to severe hypercholesterolemia in the absence of apoE.Another explanation for the impaired lipoprotein metabolism in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice is that LRP5 may recognize other lipoproteins in addition to apoE-containing lipoproteins. The candidate apoproteins that may be recognized by LRP5 remain unidentified, since the LRP5 deficiency did not significantly alter the pattern of apoproteins in the plasma lipoproteins of the apoE knockout mice or that of normal mice.In addition to the role of LRP5 in embryonic development and bone development, our current data provide further evidence that LRP5 also plays a role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. Furthermore, consistent with the marked elevation of plasma cholesterol, severe arthrosclerosis developed in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. The remarkable destruction of the internal elastic lamina seen in the lesion of the double knockout mice is characteristic of highly advanced atherosclerosis. The apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice manifesting extreme hypercholesterolemia and highly advanced arthrosclerosis will provide a useful animal model for the research and development of therapeutic agents against hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis. Genetic defects in the catabolism of plasma lipoproteins are important causes of hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis in humans. The prototypic diseases are familial hypercholesterolemia, caused by a defect in the LDL1 receptor (LDLR) (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar), and familial type III hyperlipoproteinemia, caused by a defect in one of the ligands for LDLR, apolipoprotein E (apoE) (2Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.J. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1991; 265: 78-83Google Scholar). ApoE is hypothesized to mediate lipoprotein clearance by binding two receptors: (i) LDLR and (ii) a hepatic chylomicron remnant receptor. ApoE-deficient mice (3Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Google Scholar, 4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar, 5Kashyap V.S.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Gerard R.D. Hammer R.E. Herz J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar) exhibit hypercholesterolemia, but the severity and manifestations differ markedly. On a normal laboratory chow diet, the apoE knockout mice have much more profound hypercholesterolemia and develop spontaneous atherosclerosis (4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Google Scholar). LDL receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) is a member of the LDL receptor family that are characterized by the presence of cysteine-rich complement type ligand binding domains. LRP5 binds apoE-containing lipoproteins in vitro and is widely expressed in many tissues including hepatocytes, adrenal gland, and pancreas (7Kim D.H. Inagaki Y. Suzuki T. Ioka R.X. Yoshioka S.Z. Magoori K. Kang M.J. Cho Y. Nakano A.Z. Liu Q. Fujino T. Suzuki H. Sasano H. Yamamoto T.T. J Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 1072-1076Google Scholar).

To further define the role of LRP5 in lipoprotein metabolism, we produced double knockout mice that are deficient in apoE as well as in LRP5 (apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice). In the current paper, we describe that superimposition of an LRP5 deficiency onto apoE deficiency increased plasma cholesterol beyond the level observed with apoE deficiency alone. We also show that fat tolerance was markedly impaired in the LRP5 knockout mice as well as in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. Consistent with extreme hypercholesterolemia, severe atherosclerosis developed in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. These results provide further evidence for the role of LRP5 in the catabolism of plasma lipoproteins. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we show extreme hypercholesterolemia in mice lacking both apoE and LRP5. It has been well established that both LDLR and apoE are critical in the plasma clearance of cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins, including LDL and apoE-containing intermediate density lipoprotein and chylomicron remnants (1Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Science. 1986; 232: 34-47Google Scholar, 2Mahley R.W. Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Rall S.J. JAMA (J. Am. Med. Assoc.). 1991; 265: 78-83Google Scholar). In contrast to the mice lacking apoE (3Piedrahita J.A. Zhang S.H. Hagaman J.R. Oliver P.M. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4471-4475Google Scholar, 4Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L.

Invest. 1993; 92: 883-893Google Scholar), the lack of LRP5 alone did not increase the plasma levels of cholesterol on a normal diet, whereas high fat feeding results in hypercholesterolemia in the LRP5 knockout mice (22Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M. Murase T. Kamataki A. Yamamoto J. Magoori K. Takahashi S. Miyamoto Y. Oishi H. Nose M. Okazaki M. Usui S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4431-4435Google Scholar) showed that the plasma cholesterol levels in the double knockout mice lacking both apoE and LDLR were not significantly different from the levels in the apoE knockout mice. The severe hypercholesterolemia developed in the double knockout mice lacking both apoE and LRP5 suggests the presence of an alternative pathway for cholesterol catabolism mediated by LRP5, which appears to be independent of the LDLR pathway.Consistent with the previous work (22Fujino T. Asaba H. Kang M.J. Ikeda Y. Sone H. Takada S. Kim D.H. Ioka R.X. Ono M. Tomoyori H. Okubo M. Murase T. Kamataki A. Yamamoto J. Magoori K. Takahashi S. Miyamoto Y. Oishi H. Nose M. Okazaki M. Usui S. Imaizumi K. Yanagisawa M. Sakai J. Yamamoto T.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 229-234Google Scholar), the LRP5 knockout mice and the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice displayed markedly impaired fat tolerance. In contrast, the plasma clearance of intragastrically loaded triglyceride was not significantly impaired in the apoE-knockout mice. These observations suggest that LRP5 modulates the plasma clearance of diet-derived triglycerides in the absence of apoE by stimulating the hydrolysis of triglycerides. In this context, it is important to note that LRP5 and LRP6 can bind Dickkopf (Dkk), an antagonist of Wnt proteins (12Mao B. Wu W. Li Y. Hoppe D. Stannek P. Glinka A. Niehrs C. Nature. 2001; 411: 321-325Google Scholar, 24Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Google Scholar). Dkk is involved in Xenopus head formation and the impaired action of Dkk at LRP5 increases bone density in humans (24Boyden L.M. Mao J. Belsky J. Mitzner L. Farhi A. Mitnick M.A. Wu D. Insogna K. Lifton R.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 1513-1521Google Scholar). The Dkk sequence consists of two cysteine-rich domains. The C-terminal domain has the typical cysteine pattern of colipase, which is required by pancreatic lipase for the efficient lipid hydrolysis (reviewed in Ref. 28van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of colipase binds to the C-terminal noncatalytic domain of pancreatic lipase, which is thought to stabilize an active conformation of the lipase, and is also conserved among various lipases, including hepatic and lipoprotein lipases. Detailed sequence analysis and molecular modeling of the Dkk sequence onto the colipase structure suggest that Dkk and colipase have the same disulfide pattern and very similar three-dimensional structures (28van Tilbeurgh H. Bezzine S. Cambillau C. Verger R. Carrière F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 173-184Google Scholar). This structural analogy implies a common function (lipid interaction) and raises the possibility that Dkk bound to LRP5 stimulates lipid hydrolysis by interacting with hepatic lipase and/or lipoprotein lipase. Furthermore, the impaired fat tolerance caused by the deficiency of LRP5 may lead to severe hypercholesterolemia in the absence of apoE.Another explanation for the impaired lipoprotein metabolism in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice is that LRP5 may recognize other lipoproteins in addition to apoE-containing lipoproteins. The candidate apoproteins that may be recognized by LRP5 remain unidentified, since the LRP5 deficiency did not significantly alter the pattern of apoproteins in the plasma lipoproteins of the apoE knockout mice or that of normal mice.In addition to the role of LRP5 in embryonic development and bone development, our current data provide further evidence that LRP5 also plays a role in the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins. Furthermore, consistent with the marked elevation of plasma cholesterol, severe arthrosclerosis developed in the apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice. The remarkable destruction of the internal elastic lamina seen in the lesion of the double knockout mice is characteristic of highly advanced atherosclerosis. The apoE;LRP5 double knockout mice manifesting extreme hypercholesterolemia and highly advanced arthrosclerosis will provide a useful animal model for the research and development of therapeutic agents against hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2110527632,"Fibrates are normolipidemic drugs used in atherogenic dyslipidemia because of their ability to raise high density lipoprotein (HDL) and decrease triglyceride levels. They exert multiple effects on lipid metabolism by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), which controls the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in hepatic fatty acid, cholesterol, and lipoprotein metabolism. The hepatic expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) plays a critical role in lipoprotein metabolism, mainly due to its ability to mediate selective cholesterol uptake. Because fibrates and PPAR-α agonists up-regulate SR-BI expression in human and murine macrophages, we tested whether fibrates raised a similar regulatory response on hepatic SR-BI expression in mice. Surprisingly, fibrate treatment suppressed SR-BI protein expression in the liver without changing steady state SR-BI mRNA levels. Decreased hepatic SR-BI protein expression correlated with enlarged HDL particle size. This effect was concomitant with down-regulation of CLAMP, a putative SR-BI-stabilizing protein found in the hepatic plasma membrane, which was also not associated to changes in CLAMP mRNA levels. The post-transcriptional regulatory effect of fibrates over hepatic SR-BI protein levels was dependent on PPAR-α expression, because it was absent in PPAR-α-deficient mice. Restoring hepatic SR-BI expression in fibrate-treated mice by recombinant adenoviral gene transfer abolished fibrate-mediated HDL particle size enlargement. This study describes a novel effect of fibrates on hepatic SR-BI expression providing an alternative mechanism by which this drug family modulates HDL metabolism in vivo.

Atherosclerosis. 1996; 121: 1-12Google Scholar) has attracted significant attention toward the regulation of HDL-C homeostasis and the development of drugs directed to beneficially modulate HDL-C metabolism. Plasma levels of HDL-C are determined by a complex network of interactions between lipids (e.g. fatty acids and cholesterol), circulating apolipoproteins (e.g. apoA-I and apoA-II), and lipid transfer proteins (e.g. phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) and cholesteryl ester transfer protein), extracellular lipases (e.g. hepatic lipase), cell surface receptors, and plasma membrane lipid transporters (e.g. ATP-binding cassette transporter A1). The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a cell surface HDL receptor capable of mediating selective HDL cholesterol uptake (reviewed in Refs. 3Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin.

Furthermore, additional studies have established an inverse correlation between murine hepatic SR-BI expression and atherosclerotic ischemic heart disease (10Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Vinals M. Braun A.

Taken together, these studies strongly suggest that pharmacological agents that modulate SR-BI expression and/or activity in the liver may have significant impact on HDL metabolism, reverse cholesterol transport, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Fibrates are commonly used normolipidemic drugs that efficiently decrease triglycerides and raise HDL levels in humans (14Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Duval C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Google Scholar), resulting in an overall reduction of coronary heart disease risk and events (15Ericsson C.G. Hamsten A. Nilsson J. Grip L. Svane B. de Faire U.

Med. 1999; 341: 410-418Google Scholar). Several studies in animal models and cultured cells have established that the normolipidemic effects of fibrates occur mainly through transcriptional modulation of target genes involved in fatty acid, triglyceride, and cholesterol metabolism and also in lipoprotein formation and remodeling (18Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Google Scholar). This fibrate-mediated transcriptional regulation is caused by binding and activation of a specific nuclear receptor termed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α) (reviewed in Refs. 19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Google Scholar and 20Barbier O. Pineda Torra I. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Google Scholar). Indeed, fibrate-induced effects on gene transcription depend on the presence of functional PPAR-α-response elements in the promoter region of target genes (14Pineda Torra I. Chinetti G. Duval C. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 245-254Google Scholar,19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Google Scholar). Furthermore, PPAR-α knockout mice lack the above-mentioned lipid metabolism-related responses associated with fibrate treatment (21Peters J.M. Hennuyer N. Staels B. Fruchart J.C. Fievet C. Gonzalez F.J. Auwerx J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27307-27312Google Scholar), indicating the essential role of this receptor in mediating fibrate action.

Med. 2001; 7: 53-58Google Scholar) has been studied extensively, much less is known about fibrate-dependent regulation of SR-BI. Recently, Chinetti et al. (28Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Google Scholar) have shown that PPAR-α activation increased SR-BI protein levels in cultured human monocytes as well as in fully differentiated macrophages. In addition, fenofibrate treatment elevated SR-BI protein content in macrophages of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E (apoE) knockout mice (28Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Google Scholar). These findings suggested that fibrates might modulate HDL metabolism by increasing SR-BI expression in peripheral tissues. Despite the importance of hepatic SR-BI expression for HDL metabolism and the pleiotropic effects of fibrates on HDL metabolism-related proteins in the liver, the consequences of fibrate administration on hepatic SR-BI expression have not been reported. In this study, we determined hepatic SR-BI protein and mRNA levels in fibrate-treated mice, and we correlated these findings with plasma lipoprotein cholesterol profiles. We also examined the effect of fibrates on hepatic protein and mRNA levels of CLAMP, a putative SR-BI-stabilizing protein expressed in the liver (29Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar). The PPAR-α dependence of changes in hepatic SR-BI protein expression induced by fibrates was evaluated in fibrate-treated PPAR-α knockout mice. Finally, we tested the physiological relevance of the fibrate-induced SR-BI deficiency in the liver by restoring hepatic SR-BI expression through recombinant adenoviral gene transfer in fibrate-treated mice. Control male C57BL/6 mice (2–3 months old), originally obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room with reverse light cycling and fed a low cholesterol-containing chow diet (ProLab RMH 3000; PMI Feeds, St. Louis, MO), with food and water available ad libitum. For plasma cholesterol and hepatic SR-BI and CLAMP expression studies, mice were switched to diets containing 0.2% ciprofibrate (Sanofi, Gentilly, France) or 0.2% fenofibrate (Sigma) for 7 days. For dose- and time-response studies, mice were fed with diets supplemented with ciprofibrate at the indicated doses and for the indicated times. To test the PPAR-α dependence of SR-BI regulation by fibrates, control and PPAR-α knockout mice (30Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Google Scholar) were fed with chow diet supplemented with 0.2% fenofibrate for 14 days. At day 0, control C57BL/6 mice (2–3 months old) were separated in six groups of four animals each and were switched to experimental diets as follows: one group was kept in control diet, three groups were switched to 0.2% ciprofibrate diet, and two groups were switched to 0.2% fenofibrate diet. At day 4, one group of mice treated with either ciprofibrate or fenofibrate were injected via the femoral vein with 5 × 1010 particles of murine sr-birecombinant adenovirus (Ad.mSR-BI, see Ref. 7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Google Scholar). Another group of ciprofibrate-treated mice was injected with 1 × 1011particles of lacZ recombinant adenovirus (Ad.lacZ, see Ref. 7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Google Scholar) as control for the adenoviral infection. Regardless of the use of adenoviruses, all groups were maintained until day 9 in their respective fibrate treatments. Rat hepatocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (31Berry M.N. Friend D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1969; 43: 506-520Google Scholar). Briefly, hepatocytes were prepared with collagenase perfusion from liver of male Sprague-Dawley rats. Isolated hepatocytes were seeded (105cells/well) in 6-well plates for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% glutamine without or with supplementation with 100 μm fenofibric acid. Cells were lysed with 0.2% SDS, 2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (ICN Biomedicals mixture kit) in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, and post-nuclear extracts were prepared by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C. After fibrate treatment with or without associated adenoviral infections, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (4.5 mg/100 g body weight) by intraperitoneal injection. The abdomen was opened and blood was removed by puncture of the inferior vena cava with a heparinized syringe; mice were euthanized, and livers were removed. Plasma was separated by low speed centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C and kept at −20 °C, whereas liver was stored at −70 °C for further biochemical analyses. Total membrane extracts (postnuclear 100,000 ×g membrane pellets) from individual liver samples were prepared as described (32Jokinen E.V. Landschulz K.T. Wyne K.L. Ho Y.K. Frykman P.K. Hobbs H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26411-26418Google Scholar). Size fractionation of plasma lipoproteins was performed by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) of pooled plasma samples, and total cholesterol content on each fraction was assayed enzymatically (33Amigo L. Quinones V. Mardones P. Zanlungo S. Miquel J.F. Nervi F. Rigotti A. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 772-779Google Scholar). Results are expressed as micrograms of total cholesterol per FPLC fraction. Hepatocyte post-nuclear lysates (60 μg of protein/sample) or total liver membranes (40–50 μg of protein/sample) were size-fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted on nitrocellulose with either a polyclonal antipeptide antibody against murine SR-BI protein (34Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar), a polyclonal antibody generated against the entire SR-BI protein (35Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Google Scholar), or a monoclonal antibody against recombinant CLAMP (29Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-ε-COP (36Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Google Scholar) or anti-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used as protein loading control. Antibody binding to protein samples was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified with a Macintosh Color One scanner (Apple, Cupertino, CA) and NIH imaging software version 1.6. SR-BI and CLAMP expression levels were normalized to the signal of ε-COP or actin proteins detected on the same nitrocellulose membrane. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital; the abdominal cavity was opened, and livers were perfused with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) through the portal vein. Livers were then excised and frozen under 2-methylbutane in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections (4–5 μm) of liver tissue were fixed in 7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 15 min, rinsed 3 times in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked overnight in 10% goat serum in PBS, and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with a polyclonal antibody generated against the entire SR-BI protein (35Gu X. Kozarsky K. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29993-30001Google Scholar) (dilution 1:80). As secondary antibody, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) (dilution 1:100) was used. Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary antibody. After washing in PBS, samples were mounted with coverslips using Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA). Stained sections were examined by immunofluorescence microscopy. Total RNA was prepared from mouse liver by the acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform method (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). RNA samples (20 μg/lane) were size fractionated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon. cDNA probes for SR-BI, CLAMP, and 18 S rRNA were prepared by standard reverse transcriptase-PCR using primers designed on cDNA sequences available through GenBankTM data bases. All probes were labeled by the random primer method (Promega, Madison, WI) and used for Northern blot hybridization as described previously (38Mardones P. Quinones V. Amigo L. Moreno M. Miquel J.F. Schwarz M. Miettinen H.E. Trigatti B. Krieger M. VanPatten S. Cohen D.E. Rigotti A. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 170-180Google Scholar). Quantification was performed by PhosphorImaging with the GS-525 Molecular Image System (Bio-Rad). The relative levels of SR-BI and CLAMP mRNAs were determined by normalizing in the same filter to the levels of 18 S rRNA. Results of hepatic protein and mRNA levels are expressed as fold change relative to the control group. The statistical significance of the differences between the means of the experimental groups was tested by the Student'st test or variance analysis. A difference was considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. In a previous study, Chinetti et al. (28Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Google Scholar) have shown that treatment with different PPAR-α agonists increased SR-BI protein mass in human macrophages and in atherosclerotic lesions of apoE-deficient mice. Here we tested two commonly used fibrates, ciprofibrate and fenofibrate, for the ability to modulate SR-BI protein levels in the murine liver. Treatment of mice with either 0.2% ciprofibrate or 0.2% fenofibrate drastically decreased SR-BI protein to undetectable levels when analyzed by immunoblotting in total liver membranes (Fig.1 A). The reduction of hepatic SR-BI protein levels by fibrates was dose- and time-dependent (Fig. 1, B and C), reaching its maximal effect at 0.2% ciprofibrate and after 48 h of treatment with 0.02% ciprofibrate. To confirm further the effect of fibrates on hepatic SR-BI protein expression by an alternative technique, immunofluorescence microscopy of SR-BI was performed on livers from control and 0.2% ciprofibrate-treated mice (Fig. 1 D). As shown in untreated control mice, endogenous SR-BI is primarily located in the sinusoidal domain of hepatocytes (Fig. 1 D,left panel). No basal SR-BI signal was detected in the canalicular surface of liver cells. After receiving ciprofibrate, there was a profound reduction in hepatic SR-BI protein expression detected by immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 1 D,middle panel). Note that immunostaining for SR-BI in liver slices of 0.2% ciprofibrate-treated mice is almost undistinguishable from those of the SR-BI knockout (Fig.1 D,right panel). To evaluate whether fibrate treatment alters liver SR-BI protein expression through a direct action on the hepatocyte, the effect of 100 μm fenofibric acid, the active form of fenofibrate, on SR-BI protein levels was tested in cultured rat hepatocytes (Fig.2). Treatment of rat hepatocytes with fenofibric acid reduced SR-BI protein expression by ∼50% compared with non-treated hepatocytes, indicating that fibrates suppress hepatic SR-BI protein expression acting in a direct manner on liver parenchymal cells. Fibrate-mediated changes in protein expression in the liver have been shown so far to be due to changes in target gene transcriptional activity, secondary to activation of the nuclear receptor PPAR-α (reviewed in Refs. 19Desvergne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-688Google Scholar and 20Barbier O. Pineda Torra I. Duguay Y. Blanquart C. Fruchart J.C. Glineur C. Staels B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 717-726Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether lowered hepatic SR-BI protein expression induced by fibrates was also due to decreased gene expression by analyzing SR-BI mRNA levels in livers from control and ciprofibrate-treated animals. Surprisingly, ciprofibrate treatment was not associated with changes in steady state hepatic SR-BI mRNA levels (Fig.3), suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism for fibrate-dependent regulation of SR-BI protein expression in the liver. The next important question to address was whether the down-regulation of hepatic SR-BI expression by fibrates required the presence of PPAR-α or whether this effect was PPAR-α-independent. Thus, fibrate regulation of hepatic SR-BI protein expression was analyzed in mice lacking PPAR-α. Wild-type and PPAR-α-deficient mice were treated with 0.2% fenofibrate for 14 days, and hepatic SR-BI protein levels were analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 4). Fibrate administration decreased SR-BI protein in livers of wild-type mice by 72%, whereas no change was observed in PPAR-α-deficient animals. The lack of a regulatory effect on hepatic protein SR-BI levels in fibrate-treated PPAR-α-deficient mice shows unequivocally that PPAR-α is both involved and required for the fibrate responsiveness of SR-BI protein expression. CLAMP (for carboxyl-terminal linkingand modulator protein, also known as PDZk1) is a multiple PDZ domain-containing protein, which has recently been shown to interact through its most amino-terminal PDZ domain with the cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail of SR-BI (29Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar). By coexpressing SR-BI and CLAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells, steady state levels of SR-BI protein were significantly higher in the presence of CLAMP (29Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar), suggesting its role in stabilizing SR-BI protein expression. Next, we evaluated whether changes in CLAMP expression may provide a potential mechanism for the fibrate-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of SR-BI protein expression in murine liver. As was the case for SR-BI, CLAMP protein levels were drastically decreased in the liver by fibrate administration (Fig.5 A), following dose and time pattern of responses (Fig. 5 B) similar to those of SR-BI in fibrate-treated mice (Fig. 1, B and C). To evaluate further whether decreased hepatic CLAMP protein levels were due to transcriptional repression of the CLAMP gene by fibrates, steady state CLAMP mRNA levels in livers of control and fibrate-treated mice were measured by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 5 C). Fibrates did not produce any alteration in hepatic CLAMP mRNA levels, indicating that neither SR-BI nor CLAMP were subjected to transcriptional regulation as a result of PPAR-α activation by fibrates. Due to its ability to mediate selective HDL cholesterol uptake, the experimental manipulation of hepatic SR-BI levels in mice is tightly associated with changes in HDL metabolism (6Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar, 7Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A. Iqbal S.N. Edelman E.R. Krieger M. Nature. 1997; 387: 414-417Google Scholar, 8Wang N. Arai T. Ji Y. Rinninger F. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32920-32926Google Scholar, 9Ueda Y. Royer L. Gong E. Zhang J. Cooper P.N. Francone O. Rubin E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7165-7171Google Scholar). In order to assess a potential physiological relevance of fibrate-mediated hepatic SR-BI repression with regard to HDL metabolism, we performed FPLC lipoprotein cholesterol analyses in mice fed fibrate diets. Fig. 6 shows that ciprofibrate (A) and fenofibrate (B) treatment led to the appearance of a broader HDL cholesterol peak shifted to earlier FPLC fractions, indicating the presence of more disperse and larger HDL particles. In fact, the HDL-C peak of ciprofibrate (Fig.6 A,gray circles) and fenofibrate (Fig.6 B,gray circles) groups eluted one fraction ahead of the HDL peak detected in the control group (Fig. 6, open circles). Besides an altered HDL size distribution, there was a substantial reduction in VLDL cholesterol in fibrate-treated animals reflecting the well known effect of PPAR-α activation on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein synthesis and catabolism (18Staels B. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. Schoonjans K. Leitersdorf E. Fruchart J.C. Circulation. 1998; 98: 2088-2093Google Scholar). By using molecular size monitoring by a non-denaturing electrophoretic mobility assay of density gradient-purified HDL, similar effects of fibrates on HDL size were reported in wild-type and human apoA-I transgenic mice (25Bouly M. Masson D. Gross B. Jiang X.C. Fievet C. Castro G. Tall A.R. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Lagrost L. Luc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25841-25847Google Scholar). That study also showed that the induction of PLTP expression is required for the fibrate-mediated HDL particle enlargement. Because SR-BI is another key regulator of HDL particle size (6Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar), we tested whether normalizing SR-BI hepatic protein levels by recombinant adenoviral sr-bi gene transfer might restore HDL particle size in fibrate-treated mice. FPLC lipoprotein cholesterol profiling shows that restoring hepatic SR-BI protein expression (Fig.6, insets) abolished the fibrate-induced HDL enlargement (Fig. 6, black circles) with a concomitant reduction in HDL and LDL cholesterol levels. Ciprofibrate-treated mice infected with an adenovirus carrying the control gene lacZ showed an almost identical FPLC profile to that of mice treated with fibrates only (data not shown), establishing that the reversal of HDL enlargement was mediated specifically by SR-BI and not by an artifact due to the adenoviral infection. These findings suggest that SR-BI down-regulation plays a role in determining increased HDL particle size following PPAR-α activation by fibrates. This study demonstrates that SR-BI and the SR-BI-interacting protein CLAMP are down-regulated by fibrates in the murine liver by a novel post-transcriptional PPAR-α-dependent mechanism. Fibrate-mediated reduced hepatic SR-BI expression correlated with enlarged HDL particle size, which was reverted by normalizing hepatic SR-BI levels by recombinant adenoviral gene transfer. Taken together, these findings are consistent with a functionally relevant effect of fibrate-dependent hepatic SR-BI regulation on HDL metabolism in mice. Even though SR-BI is a key regulator of HDL metabolism (reviewed in Refs. 3Trigatti B. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Google Scholar, 4Krieger M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 523-558Google Scholar, 5Trigatti B.L. Rigotti A. Braun A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 276-286Google Scholar), the role of PPAR-α activation on controlling SR-BI expression in the liver, a major site of PPAR-α and SR-BI expression as well as selective HDL cholesterol uptake, had not been thoroughly investigated. In clear contrast to the effect observed in macrophages (28Chinetti G. Gbaguidi F.G. Griglio S. Mallat Z. Antonucci M. Poulain P. Chapman J. Fruchart J.C. Tedgui A. Najib-Fruchart J. Staels B. Circulation. 2000; 101: 2411-2417Google Scholar), ciprofibrate and fenofibrate led to a marked reduction of immunodetectable SR-BI in the liver of treated mice in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1). More intriguingly, hepatic SR-BI mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. 3), suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism for SR-BI protein down-regulation by fibrates. SR-BI protein was also reduced by fibrate treatment in isolated rat hepatocytes (Fig. 2), clearly showing that the in vivo data were not an indirect systemic effect of fibrates but rather involved a defined molecular mechanism of action of these drugs on the hepatic cells. Because SR-BI was post-transcriptionally down-regulated, it was tempting to speculate that PPAR-α would not be required for the effect of fibrates on hepatic SR-BI expression. However, the post-transcriptional regulation of SR-BI indeed required normal PPAR-α expression as shown by the lack of effect of fibrate treatment on hepatic SR-BI protein levels of PPAR-α- deficient mice (Fig. 4). Post-transcriptional control of SR-BI expression was originally suggested by the initial characterization of its expression pattern in different tissues (34Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar) and has later been reported in a variety of experimental models. In apoE-deficient mice, there was a 2.3-fold induction of hepatic SR-BI protein without changes in SR-BI mRNA (39Arai T. Rinninger F. Varban L. Fairchild-Huntress V. Liang C.P. Chen W. Seo T. Deckelbaum R. Huszar D. Tall A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12050-12055Google Scholar). Similarly, Witt et al. (40Witt W. Kolleck I. Fechner H. Sinha P. Rustow B. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2009-2016Google Scholar) demonstrated that hepatic SR-BI protein was strongly induced (11-fold) in rats fed a vitamin E-deficient diet and was down-regulated in HepG2 cells incubated with a vitamin E-enriched culture medium, in both cases without concomitant changes in SR-BI mRNA. In nephrotic rats, there was also a decrease in hepatic SR-BI protein, but SR-BI mRNA levels remained unaltered (41Liang K. Vaziri N.D. Kidney Int. 1999; 56: 621-626Google Scholar). Finally, intestinal SR-BI protein, but not mRNA, is down-regulated in several experimental models of impaired enterohepatic circulation, such as bile-diverted rats, Mdr2-deficient mice, and cholesterol-7α-hydroxylase-deficient mice (42Voshol P.J. Schwarz M. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Groen A.K. Kuipers F. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 317-325Google Scholar). Whether altered PPAR-α signaling might be underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of SR-BI under some of these experimental conditions remains to be explored. However, the current work clearly indicates that hepatic SR-BI regulation is commanded by a PPAR-α-dependent fibrate-activated event possibly due to transcriptional modulation of a yet unrecognized gene that controls expression/stability of SR-BI protein itself and/or other proteins involved in the SR-BI pathway. Interestingly, CLAMP (a hepatic protein potentially involved in SR-BI stabilization in hepatocyte plasma membrane (29Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar)) showed a similar regulated expression as SR-BI in fibrate-treated animals (Fig. 5). This is the first example of pharmacological regulation of CLAMP expressionin vivo. By using site-directed mutagenesis of SR-BI within the CLAMP-interacting domain, Silver (43Silver D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34042-34047Google Scholar) has shown recently the critical requirement of SR-BI/CLAMP interaction for adequate expression of SR-BI in the cell surface of hepatocytes. On the other hand, SR-BI expression is not required for hepatic CLAMP expression, because CLAMP protein levels are normal in livers of SR-BI-deficient mice (data not shown). We speculate that the simultaneous post-transcriptional down-regulation of hepatic CLAMP and SR-BI expression by fibrates might have been caused by modulation of a yet undiscovered PPAR-α target gene that controls SR-BI and CLAMP protein synthesis, interaction, intracellular trafficking, or degradation as a protein-protein complex, or by two completely independent regulatory events on these proteins elicited by fibrates. As reported previously for estrogen and androgen receptors (44Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S.

Parfitt A.M. Weinstein R.S. Jilka R.L. Manolagas S.C. Science. 2002; 298: 843-846Google Scholar), PPAR-α could also be modulating a signal transduction pathway through a non-genomic activity that results in decreased SR-BI and CLAMP protein levels. The effect of fibrates on hepatic SR-BI and CLAMP protein expression is indeed the first reported case in which fibrate treatment-induced changes in the levels of proteins expressed in the liver are not associated with concomitant variations in their corresponding mRNAs. In this regard, our study also indicates that gene expression analyses associated with PPAR-α activation might have been biased by only looking at steady state mRNA levels of target genes rather than protein levels or functional activities encoded by those genes. In fact, a preliminary study (47Spijkers J.A. Hoen P.S. Kruijt J.K. Groot P.H. Van Berkel T.J. Circulation. 2001; 104: A713Google Scholar) has reported no effect of treatment with PPAR-α agonists on hepatic SR-BI mRNA levels in primary rat hepatocytes. Our analysis on SR-BI regulation induced by fibrates emphasizes the potential relevance of proteomic studies regarding regulation by pharmacological or physiological activators of PPAR-α in particular as well as other nuclear receptors and transcription factors. Mice treated with the PPAR-α agonists ciprofibrate or fenofibrate exhibited enlarged HDL particle sizes, which were normalized when hepatic SR-BI protein levels were restored by recombinant adenoviral SR-BI gene transfer in fibrate-treated mice (Fig. 6, A andB). These findings are consistent with a potential role of SR-BI in the altered HDL particle size distribution produced by fibrate treatment besides the up-regulation of PLTP (25Bouly M. Masson D. Gross B. Jiang X.C. Fievet C. Castro G. Tall A.R. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Lagrost L. Luc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25841-25847Google Scholar). The absolute requirement of PLTP up-regulation for fibrate-induced HDL particle enlargement, as reported previously (25Bouly M. Masson D. Gross B. Jiang X.C. Fievet C. Castro G. Tall A.R. Fruchart J.C. Staels B. Lagrost L. Luc G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 25841-25847Google Scholar), does not discard the notion that this phenotype might also be due to the down-regulation of SR-BI, whose deficiency in mice caused the appearance of bigger and more heterogeneous HDL particles (6Rigotti A. Trigatti B.L. Penman M. Rayburn H. Herz J. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12610-12615Google Scholar) similar to those found in fibrate-treated mice. We speculate that SR-BI may contribute to the appearance of abnormal HDL particles in fibrate-treated PLTP-expressing mice as a downstream element of the PLTP-mediated HDL remodeling. However, the hepatic SR-BI pathway for selective cholesterol uptake may be less relevant in PLTP-deficient mice because this receptor has higher affinity for lipid-rich large HDL (48Liadaki K.N. Liu T. Xu S. Ishida B.Y. Duchateaux P.N. Krieger J.P. Kane J. Krieger M. Zannis V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21262-21271Google Scholar). In fact, lipid-poor HDL from PLTP knockout mice are hypercatabolized most likely through an SR-BI-independent pathway (49Qin S. Kawano K. Bruce C. Lin M. Bisgaier C. Tall A.R. Jiang X. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 269-276Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that SR-BI and PLTP may act in concert to modulate HDL size distribution in wild-type mice, whereas SR-BI is less relevant in controlling HDL particle size in PLTP-deficient animals. In summary, we have identified a novel PPAR-α-dependent, post-transcriptional effect of fibrates over SR-BI expression in murine liver, which may lead to a better understanding of how these drugs affect lipoprotein metabolism in vivo. We thank Monty Krieger for providing antibodies and support, Valeska Volrath and Verónica Quiñones for helping with Northern blotting, and Frank J. Gonzalez for sharing the PPAR-α knockout mice."

Previous studies have indicated that the GTP-binding protein, Rab3A, plays a mechanistic role in insulin exocytosis. Here, we report that Rab3A−/− mice develop fasting hyperglycemia and upon a glucose challenge show significant glucose intolerance coupled to ablated first-phase insulin release and consequential insufficient insulin secretion in vivo, without insulin resistance. Thein vivo insulin secretory response to arginine was similar in Rab3A−/− mice as Rab3A+/+ control animals, indicating a phenotype reminiscent of insulin secretory dysfunction found in type-2 diabetes. However, when a second arginine dose was given 10 min after, there was a negligible insulin secretory response in Rab3A−/− mice, compared with that in Rab3A+/+ animals, that was markedly increased above that to the first arginine stimulus. There was no difference in β-cell mass or insulin production between Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice. However, in isolated islets, secretagogue-induced insulin release (by glucose, GLP-1, glyburide, or fatty acid) was ∼60–70% lower in Rab3A−/− islets compared with Rab3A+/+ controls. Nonetheless, there was a similar rate of glucose oxidation and glucose-induced rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i flux between Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ islet β-cells, indicating the mechanistic role of Rab3A lies downstream of generating secondary signals that trigger insulin release, at the level of secretory granule transport and/or exocytosis. Thus, Rab3A plays an important in vivo role facilitating the efficiency of insulin exocytosis, most likely at the level of replenishing the ready releasable pool of β-granules. Also, this study indicates, for the first time, that the in vivoinsulin secretory dysfunction found in type-2 diabetes can lie solely at the level of defective insulin exocytosis.

Nonetheless, there was a similar rate of glucose oxidation and glucose-induced rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i flux between Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ islet β-cells, indicating the mechanistic role of Rab3A lies downstream of generating secondary signals that trigger insulin release, at the level of secretory granule transport and/or exocytosis. Thus, Rab3A plays an important in vivo role facilitating the efficiency of insulin exocytosis, most likely at the level of replenishing the ready releasable pool of β-granules. Also, this study indicates, for the first time, that the in vivoinsulin secretory dysfunction found in type-2 diabetes can lie solely at the level of defective insulin exocytosis. Insulin is the major anabolic hormone controlling metabolic homeostasis, and without an effective supply of insulin diabetes mellitus ensues. Type-1 diabetes occurs as a result of autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells that produce insulin, and type-2 diabetes develops as a result of insulin secretory dysfunction, as well as insufficient β-cell mass, that no longer compensates for peripheral insulin resistance (1Leahy J.L. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 992-1010Google Scholar, 2Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Google Scholar). The insulin secretory dysfunction in type-2 diabetes is derived from β-cell secretory abnormalities, proposed to be either at the level irregular glucose metabolism required for generating secondary signals necessary to trigger insulin exocytosis and/or deficiencies in the exocytotic mechanism itself (1Leahy J.L. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 992-1010Google Scholar,3Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Google Scholar). Insulin secretion from the β-cell is highly regulated and only occurs in response to certain nutrients, hormones, neurotransmitters, and pharmacological reagents (4Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S32-S41Google Scholar). Of these, glucose is the most physiologically relevant. The secondary signals that emanate from increased glucose metabolism to stimulate insulin release in β-cells have been relatively well defined, and of these a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i is a prerequisite (4Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S32-S41Google Scholar, 5Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Google Scholar). Indeed, increased [Ca2+]i is the necessary signal to trigger regulated exocytosis in most neuroendocrine cells (6Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Google Scholar). In comparison, the mechanism of insulin exocytosis is less well defined. Several proteins required for insulin exocytosis in β-cells have been indicated, including SNARE (solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) proteins, analogous to the mechanism of regulated exocytosis in neurons (5Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Google Scholar). However, how such “exocytotic proteins” interact in a regulated manner to control insulin exocytosis is currently unclear (5Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Google Scholar). One protein implicated to play a role in control of insulin exocytosis is the small GTP-binding protein, Rab3A (7Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). In β-cells, Rab3A is located on the cytosolic face of β-granules where it is probably involved in control of β-granule transport and/or exocytosis (8Regazzi R. Ravazzola M. Lezzi M. Lang J.C. Zahraoui A. Andereggen E. Morel P. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2265-2273Google Scholar, 9Iezzi M. Escher G. Meda P. Charollais A. Baldini G. Darchen F. Wollheim C.B. Regazzi R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 202-212Google Scholar). Members of the Rab protein family are key to directing vesicular transport in eukaryotic cells (10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Google Scholar). In Rab3A−/− mice, there is a defect in recruiting synaptic vesicles for exocytosis in hippocampal neurons (11Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Slegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Google Scholar), and it has been indicated that Rab3A plays a role in the later stages of synaptic vesicle exocytosis controlling the efficiency of neurotransmitter release (12Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C.F. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Google Scholar). However, although there are similarities, the mechanism of synaptic vesicle exocytosis is distinct from that for large dense-core granules (13Martin T.F.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 626-632Google Scholar). Nonetheless, given the proposed key role that Rab3A plays in controlling insulin exocytosis, we examined whether there was a deficient insulin secretory phenotype of Rab3A−/− mice that would not only better characterize the mechanism of exocytosis in β-cells, but also reveal novel insight into insulin secretory dysfunction found in type-2 diabetes. The EasyTagTMExpre35S35S protein labeling mix from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, containing 73% ofl-[35S]methionine, was used for islet protein synthesis radiolabeling. Uridine 5′-[α-32P]trisphosphate (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences.d-[U-14C]glucose (250–360 mCi/mmol) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. GLP-17–36was purchased from Bachem Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). Rab3A polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and VAMP-2 antibody was from Calbiochem. The anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and obtained from either Sigma or Fisher. The Rab3A+/+ on a B6 background (B6129SF2/J) and Rab3A−/− mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark cycle and were allowed free access to standard mouse food and water. Mice were used at 12–20 weeks of age. Glucose (1 mg/g), arginine (1 mg/g), and insulin (0.75 milliunits/g) tolerance tests were performed on 15–17-week-old Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice after an overnight fast by intraperitoneal injection dose relative to body weight as described (14Briaud I. Kelpe C.L. Johnson L.M. Tran P.O. Poitout V. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 662-668Google Scholar). Blood samples were obtained from the tail vein at the times indicated after the glucose injection. Blood glucose concentrations were measured with a HemoCue blood glucose analyzer (HemoCue AB, Ängelholm, Sweden), and plasma insulin levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem, Chicago, IL). Pancreatic mouse islets were isolated by collagenase digestion, and insulin secretory activity examined in static or perifusion incubation studies of isolated islets as described previously (15Donelan M. Julyan R. Kajio H. Hays L. Easom R. Morfini G. Brady S.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24232-24242Google Scholar), in response to various concentrations glucose, 1 nm GLP-1, 5 μm glyburide, or 125 μm oleate complexed to 1% (w/v) BSA. 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; IPGTT, intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test(s); IPITT, intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test(s); GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide-1 Pancreata from 16-week Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice were removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, rinsed in ethanol, and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (10 μm) were stained with hematoxyline and eosin or immunostained with either anti-insulin or a combination of anti-glucagon/anti-somatostatin antibodies for visualization of islet β-cells and α-/δ-cells using a Leica confocal microscope as described previously (16Ensinck J.W. Baskin D.G. Vahl T.P. Vogel R.E. Laschansky E.C. Francis B.H. Hoffman R.C. Krakover J.D. Stamm M.R. Low M.J. Rubinstein M. Otero-Corchon V. D'Alessio D.A. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2599-2609Google Scholar). For each section the number and cross-sectional islet area, and the number and size of β-cells and α-/δ-cells per islet were assessed (2Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Google Scholar). Glucose oxidation assays were performed as described previously (17Skelly R.H. Wicksteed B.L. Antinozzi P.A. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1791-1798Google Scholar). Briefly, groups of 40–50 islets were suspended in 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, 16 mm HEPES, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA containing 2.8 mm glucose or 16.7 mm glucose in rounded bottom cups sealed with a rubber-sleeved stopper. Then, ∼2 × 105 cpm of [U-14C]glucose in samples containing glucose as a substrate was added to the islet suspensions. The cups were then sealed within a 20-ml borosilicate glass scintillation vial using a rubber-sleeved stopper and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Then islet-cell oxidation was halted by the addition of 20 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 100 μm rotenone to the islets in the cups via the sleeved stoppers. Afterward, 100 μl of HClO4 was added to the islets in the cup, and 300 μl of 1 mbenzethonium was added to the bottom of the scintillation vials via the appropriate sleeved stoppers. The samples then were incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Then the seals were removed, the cups were discarded, and 10 ml of scintillation mixture was added to the vials. The vials then were kept at 25 °C overnight before scintillation counting. Freshly isolated islets from 16-week Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 200 μl of Krebs-Ringer buffer (pH 7.4) containing a basal 2.8 mm or stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Messenger RNA levels were analyzed by the RNase protection assay, as described previously (18Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcón C. Lingohr M.L. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitaton analysis of proinsulin biosynthesis in isolated islets pulse-radiolabeled with [35S]methionine was as described previously (18Wicksteed B. Herbert T.P. Alarcón C. Lingohr M.L. Moss L.G. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22553-22558Google Scholar). Dual-wavelength excitation microspectrophotometry was used to measure [Ca2+]i as described previously (19Roe M.W. Worley 3rd, J.F. Qian F. Tamarina N. Mittal A.A. Dralyuk F. Blair N.T. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10402-10410Google Scholar). Isolated islets from 18-week Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+mice were loaded with Fura-2 by a 25-min incubation at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer buffer containing basal 2.8 glucose and 5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) and then placed into a temperature-controlled perfusion chamber (Medical Systems Inc.) mounted on an inverted epifluorescence microscope (Diaphot, Nikon, Inc.) and perifused by a continuous flow (rate: 2.5 ml/min) of 5% CO2-bubbled Krebs-Ringer buffer at 37 °C. Groups of islets are visualized with a ×20 quartz objective. Fura-2 dual wavelength excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and detection of single wavelength emission at 510 nm was accomplished using the Metafluor/Metamorph system (Universal Imaging Corp.); images were collected with an intensified CCD camera. Where appropriate, results are expressed as a mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired Student's t test or repeated measure analysis of variance, where p < 0.05 was considered significant. Pancreatic β-cells are located in the islets of Langerhans of the endocrine pancreas. By immunoblot analysis it was first confirmed that Rab3A protein was indeed absent in isolated Rab3A−/−mice versus Rab3A+/+ control mice compared with other β-granule proteins involved in insulin exocytosis, such as VAMP-2 (Fig. 1). At >3 months old, a glucose-intolerant phenotype emerged in Rab3A−/− mice. Male Rab3A−/− mice at 4 months old exhibited significant (p ≤ 0.05) fasting hyperglycemia (127.4 ± 3.0 mg/dl; n = 25) compared with male Rab3A+/+animals (102.2 ± 4.1 mg/dl; n = 15). Fasting blood glucose levels did not significantly differ in female Rab3A−/− mice compared with Rab3A+/+ controls (108.0 ± 4.2 mg/dl; n = 22 versus102.9 ± 3.2 mg/dl; n = 11, respectively). It is not uncommon for a diabetic/glucose-intolerant phenotype to be much more severe in male versus female transgenic mouse models of this age (20Kido Y. Burks D.J. Withers D. Bruning J.C. Kahn C.R. White M.F. Accili D. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 199-205Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT) indicated that male Rab3A−/− mice were significantly glucose-intolerant showing an increased excursion in blood glucose in response to a glucose load compared with control Rab3A+/+animals (Fig. 2 A). Fasting insulin levels in male Rab3A−/− mice were lower (349 ± 36 pg/ml; n = 16) but not statistically significantly different from male Rab3A+/+ mice (428 ± 56 pg/ml; n = 12). However, in response to a glucose challenge of an IPGTT, Rab3A−/− mice showed a severe decrease in first phase plasma insulin secretory response accompanied by a marked ∼75% decrease in plasma insulin levels compared with Rab3A+/+ mice (Fig. 2 B). An intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests (IPITT) indicated that insulin sensitivity was unaltered in either male Rab3A−/− mice (Fig.2 C), indicative of minimal insulin resistance in these animals.Figure 2Glucose intolerance and insulin secretory insufficiency, but normal insulin sensitivity in Rab3A −/− mice. A, intraperitoneal glucose (1 mg/g) tolerance tests (IPGTT) were performed on 16-h fasted Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice and glucose levels measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A mean ± S.E. of blood glucose levels are shown, where ● represents Rab3A−/−mice (n = 24), and ▪ represents Rab3A+/+mice (n = 18). B, plasma insulin levels were also measured during an IPGTT. A mean ± S.E. of plasma insulin levels are shown, where ● represents Rab3A−/− mice (n = 18), and ▪ represents Rab3A+/+ mice (n = 14). C, IPITT were performed on 16-h fasted Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A mean ± S.E. of glucose levels during the IPITT are shown, where ● represents Rab3A−/− mice (n = 15), and ▪ represents Rab3A+/+ mice (n = 12).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In contrast to the IPGTT, an intraperitoneal arginine stimulus (1 mg/g) showed no apparent deficiency in the in vivo insulin secretory response in Rab3A−/− versusRab3A+/+ control mice (Fig.3 A). However, when a second intraperitoneal dose (1 mg/g) was given 10 min after the first, the subsequent insulin secretory response to arginine was negated (p ≤ 0.05) in Rab3A−/− mice compared with an enhanced response in Rab3A+/+control animals (Fig. 3 B). Blood glucose levels in Rab3A−/− or Rab3A+/+ mice did not appreciably alter during the in vivo arginine stimulus (Fig.3 C). The insulin secretory-deficient phenotype of the Rab3A−/−mice did not appear to be based at the level of defective (pro)insulin production. Isolated pancreatic islets from Rab3A−/− mice had similar insulin content stores to that of Rab3A+/+ mouse islets (Fig.4 A). Likewise, preproinsulin mRNA levels were equivalent in islets from Rab3A−/− versus Rab3A+/+ mice (Fig. 4 B), and translational control of glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis was unaffected in isolated Rab3A−/− mouse islets (Fig.4 C). Immunohisotchemical examination of pancreata from Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice indicated no discernable difference in islet architecture, with insulin-expressing β-cells in the central core of an islet and glucagon expressing α-cells and somatostatin expressing δ-cells around the periphery (Fig. 4). Further analysis of pancreatic serial sections showed no obvious change between Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+mice in islet number per pancreas, islet size, number of β-cells, and non-β-cells per islet or size of β-cells and non-β-cells per islet (data not shown). The weight and size of pancreata from Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice were equivalent, and as such it is reasonable to deduce that there was no change in pancreatic β-cell mass between Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice. It follows that the insulin secretory-deficient phenotype of Rab3A−/− mice does not reside at the level of insufficient insulin production. An increase in β-cell glucose metabolism is required to generate secondary signals for glucose-induced insulin secretion (4Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S32-S41Google Scholar, 21Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Google Scholar) and proinsulin biosynthesis (17Skelly R.H. Wicksteed B.L. Antinozzi P.A. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1791-1798Google Scholar, 21Ashcroft S.J.H. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 5-15Google Scholar). We compared the rate of glucose oxidation in isolated islets from Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mice and found that there was no significant difference in glucose oxidation at either a basal 2.8 mm or stimulatory 16.7 mm glucose concentration (Fig.5). As such, the insulin secretory deficiency in Rab3A−/− mouse β-cells does not lie at the level of defective glucose metabolism. Downstream of increased glucose metabolism, a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i in pancreatic β-cells is essential to trigger glucose-induced insulin secretion (4Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S32-S41Google Scholar, 5Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Google Scholar, 7Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). We examined whether the insulin secretory-deficient phenotype of Rab3A−/− mice was due to a defect in generating secondary signals required to trigger insulin exocytosis by measuring glucose-induced increases in β-cell [Ca2+]i. Changes in cytosolic [Ca2+]i was monitored by Fura-2 fluorescence imaging as described previously (19Roe M.W. Worley 3rd, J.F. Qian F. Tamarina N. Mittal A.A. Dralyuk F. Blair N.T. Mertz R.J. Philipson L.H. Dukes I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10402-10410Google Scholar). Increasing the glucose concentration from a basal 2 mm glucose to a stimulatory 14 mm glucose induced a significant rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i, after a short lag period, that was equivalent in isolated islet β-cells from Rab3A−/−and Rab3A+/+ mice (Fig. 6). However, there was a subtle difference in subsequent glucose-induced oscillations in [Ca2+]i. Although the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i oscillations did not appreciably change the frequency of [Ca2+]i, oscillations were slower in Rab3A−/− compared with Rab3A+/+ islet β-cells (Fig. 6, A versus B). Nonetheless, despite this disparity in glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillations the total increase in [Ca2+]i was only 4% lower in Rab3A−/− islet β-cells. This was reaffirmed in that depolarization of islet β-cells with 30 mm KCl at 2 mm glucose gave an identical rapid increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]i in both in Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ islet β-cells, which promptly returned to basal cytosolic [Ca2+]i levels on removal of the stimulus (Fig. 6). As such, there was not a noticeable defect in inducing a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i in Rab3A−/− mouse islet β-cells that was sufficient to explain the insulin secretory deficiency in vivo. Characterization of regulated insulin secretion from isolated islets indicated a defect downstream of generating secondary signals in Rab3A−/− islet β-cells, at the level of insulin exocytosis. In static in vitro incubation experiments, basal insulin secretion from isolated Rab3A−/− mouse islets was equivalent to control Rab3A+/+ mouse islets (Fig.7, A and B). However, secretagogue-stimulated insulin release was compromised in Rab3A−/− islets. Qualitatively, the glucose dose-response pattern for stimulated insulin secretion from Rab3A−/−and Rab3A+/+ islets was similar, with a typical threshold glucose concentration between 5 and 6 mm glucose reaching a maximum insulin secretory rate at >15 mm glucose (Fig.7 A). However, Rab3A−/− islets secreted only 30–40% of the amount of insulin secreted by control Rab3A+/+ islets (Fig. 7 A). Likewise, the potentiation of glucose-induced insulin secretion by GLP-1, the sulfonylurea, glyburide, or the fatty acid, oleate, was decreased by ∼60% in Rab3A−/− islets compared with control Rab3A+/+ islets (Fig. 7 B). Examination of the biphasic pattern of insulin secretion in perifused islets from Rab3A−/− mice indicated the kinetics for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to be comparable with Rab3A+/+ islets; however, a major abnormality was found in a blunted first phase of insulin release (between 3 and 13 min) that consequentially diminished the second phase in Rab3A−/−islets (Fig. 7 C). As a result, the accumulated glucose-induced insulin secretion over 40 min in perifused Rab3A−/− islets was significantly reduced by ∼70% compared with control Rab3A+/+ islets (Fig.7 D). Rab3A−/− mice are glucose-intolerant and exhibit loss of first-phase insulin secretory response to glucose, but the insulin secretory response to a single dose of arginine was similar in Rab3A−/− versus Rab3A+/+ control mice, which are typical characteristics of insulin secretory dysfunction in type-2 diabetes (1Leahy J.L. Diabetes Care. 1990; 13: 992-1010Google Scholar, 3Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Google Scholar). This insulin secretory dysfunction in the Rab3A−/− mice did not appear to be driven by peripheral insulin resistance, but rather by a primary defect in the pancreatic β-cell. This was reaffirmed in that stimulated insulin secretion from Rab3A−/− mouse isolated isletsin vitro was markedly decreased compared with control Rab3A+/+ islets. However, since Rab3A−/− mice may have impaired secretory function in other neuroendocrine cells (11Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Slegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Google Scholar), it is possible that the β-cell secretory defect could be secondary, particularly when considering hypothalamic or adrenergic cells. However, when isolated islets from Rab3A−/− mice are cultured for 24 or 48 h, that would give time to recover from any in vivo influence of circulating factors, the insulin secretory response to glucose ± glyburide, GLP-1, or oleate remained 60–70% inhibited compared with similarly cultured Rab3A+/+ control islets (data not shown), as found in freshly isolated islets (Fig. 7). Moreover, if the blunted insulin secretory response in β-cells were secondary to increased α-adrenergic activity, one would also expect to see a blunted first phase insulin secretory response to arginine in vivo (22Ahren B. Taborsky G.J.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1988; 132: 143-150Google Scholar,23Ortiz-Alonso F.J. Herman W.H. Zobel D.L. Perry T.J. Smith M.J. Halter J.B. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 1194-1202Google Scholar), a decrease in glucose- and K+-induced rise in cytosolic [Ca2+]i (24Drews G. Debuyser A. Nenquin M. Henquin J.C. Endocrinology. 1990; 126: 1646-1653Google Scholar, 25Debuyser A. Drews G. Henquin J.C. Pfluegers Arch. 1991; 419: 131-137Google Scholar), as well as glucose-induced proinsulin biosynthesis (26Malaisse W.J. Pipeleers D.G. Levy J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 362: 121-128Google Scholar). However, there were no differences found in these parameters between Rab3A−/−and Rab3A+/+ control mouse islets (Figs. 3 A, 4, and 6). Thus, the most likely scenario is that the insulin secretory dysfunction in the Rab3A−/− mice is due to a primary defect in the β-cell itself. There was no difference in pancreatic β-cell mass in between Rab3A−/− versus Rab3A+/+ mice and neither was insulin production and intracellular stores of insulin affected in Rab3A−/− mouse islets. As such, the insulin secretory deficiency in Rab3A−/− mice was not due to an insufficient store or supply of insulin. Glucose metabolism is a prerequisite to generate secondary signals for glucose-induced insulin secretion and proinsulin biosynthesis, but rates of glucose oxidation were similar in Rab3A−/− and Rab3A+/+ mouse islets (Fig. 5). This indicated that insulin secretory dysfunction in Rab3A−/− mice was not due to defective β-cell glucose sensing or metabolism. Indeed, the observation that glucose-induced translational control of proinsulin biosynthesis was unaffected in Rab3A−/− indicated that stimulus-response coupling mechanisms were intact in Rab3A−/− β-cells. This was reaffirmed in that glucose- and K+-induced depolarization of Rab3A−/− islet β-cells caused an increase in cytosolic [Ca2+]i similar to that in Rab3A+/+ islet β-cells. As such, the defect in insulin secretion in Rab3A−/− mouse β-cells most likely lies downstream of generating secondary signals, at the level of insulin exocytosis. A defective exocytosis mechanism in Rab3A−/−islet β-cells would also be consistent with the observation that the insulin secretory response to all secretagogues tested in vitro was reduced by ≥50% in Rab3A−/− islets, despite these secretagogues stimulating insulin secretion via distinct signaling mechanisms (4Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40 Suppl. 2: S32-S41Google Scholar). In pancreatic β-cells, Rab3A is mostly located on the cytosolic face of β-granule membranes and has been implicated to play a role in control of insulin exocytosis (8Regazzi R. Ravazzola M. Lezzi M. Lang J.C. Zahraoui A. Andereggen E. Morel P. Takai Y. Wollheim C.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2265-2273Google Scholar, 9Iezzi M. Escher G. Meda P. Charollais A. Baldini G. Darchen F. Wollheim C.B. Regazzi R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 202-212Google Scholar), as it does for Ca2+-dependent exocytosis in other neuroendocrine cell types (10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Google Scholar). Here, we find that the absence of Rab3A in β-cells decreases secretagogue-induced insulin secretion in vivo and in vitro, reaffirming an important role of Rab3A in control of insulin exocytosis. Rab GTP-binding proteins specifically direct vesicular transport by an interaction with a particular “effector protein,” characteristic of an individual Rab protein and neuroendocrine cell type (10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Google Scholar). Rab3A has been shown to interact with several candidate effector proteins (10Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 107-117Google Scholar), but the Rab3A-calmodulin interaction appears most pertinent in control of Ca2+-regulated insulin exocytosis (27Coppola T. Perret-Menoud V. Luthi S. Farnsworth C.C. Glomset J.A. Regazzi R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5885-5891Google Scholar). Recently, it has been found that the Rab3A-calmodulin interaction on β-granules provides a platform for local activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase, calcineurin, in response to increased [Ca2+]i (15Donelan M. Julyan R. Kajio H. Hays L. Easom R. Morfini G. Brady S.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24232-24242Google Scholar, 28Kajio H. Olszewski S. Rosner P. Donelan M. Geoghegan K. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2029-2040Google Scholar). Activation of calcineurin on β-granules then leads to dephosphorylation activation of the ATP-dependent motor, kinesin, and subsequent transport of β-granules to a “readily releasable pool” docked at the β-cell plasma membrane committed to undergo exocytosis (15Donelan M. Julyan R. Kajio H. Hays L. Easom R. Morfini G. Brady S.T. Rhodes C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24232-24242Google Scholar). Therefore, in the absence of Rab3A, calmodulin cannot be readily sequestered to the β-granule membrane for local activation of calcineurin and kinesin in response to elevated [Ca2+]i, so that β-granule transport becomes much less efficient, the number of β-granules recruited to a readily releasable pool is reduced, and consequently insulin exocytosis is impaired. A defect in replenishing the readily releasable pool of β-granules in β-cells of Rab3A−/−mice would be consistent with the observations of a blunted first-phase glucose-induced insulin release in vitro and in vivo, as well as a severely diminished insulin secretory response to a second arginine stimulus where the prior arginine stimulus would have emptied the readily releasable pool of β-granules. Moreover, such a mechanism is also consistent with observations of a decay in synaptic transmissions in hippocampal neurons of Rab3A−/−mice in response to multiple repeat Ca2+-induced stimulations, which are normally sustained as found in Rab3A+/+ mice (11Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Slegelbaum S.A. Takei K. De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Google Scholar). Our study of the Rab3A−/− insulin secretory phenotype indicates that the root of β-cell secretory dysfunction in type-2 diabetes does not necessarily lie at the level of glucose-sensing and β-cell metabolism from which secondary signals emanate (e.g. a rise in [Ca2+]i), but rather at the level of a defective insulin exocytosis mechanism. This would be symptomatic of insulin secretory dysfunction in type-2 diabetes arising from an “overworked” β-cell trying hard, but not quite succeeding, to compensate for peripheral insulin resistance (3Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Google Scholar). In the face of persistent hyperglycemia in type-2 diabetes, the β-cell is chronically stimulated to produce and secrete much higher amounts of insulin than usual, and as such there is a higher rate of β-granule turnover. This, in turn, compromises β-granule transport that depletes the ready releasable pool of β-granules, so that insulin secretory insufficiency develops leading to β-cell secretory dysfunction (29Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Gromada J. Barg S. Gopel S. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77Google Scholar). Such is the case with Rab3A−/− mice, best illustrated by a severe reduction in the in vivoinsulin secretory response to a second consecutive arginine stimulus that is contrastingly augmented in normal Rab3A+/+ animals. However, there are no reports in the literature of an insulin secretory response to such a double consecutive arginine stimulus test in human type-2 diabetics, but if pursued could well reveal a similar insulin secretory insufficiency found in Rab3A−/− mice that would be supportive of insulin secretory dysfunction in human type-2 diabetes arising from deficiencies in the insulin exocytotic mechanism due to β-cell exhaustion (3Kahn S.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 4047-4058Google Scholar, 29Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Gromada J. Barg S. Gopel S. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77Google Scholar). In this regard, it should be noted that if the β-cell is induced to rest its secretory activity in type-2 diabetics, normal insulin secretory function can be recovered (30Laedtke T. Kjems L. Porksen N. Schmitz O. Veldhuis J. Kao P.C. Butler P.C. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 279: E520-E528Google Scholar). Notwithstanding, the glucose-intolerant/insulin secretory deficient phenotype of Rab3A−/− mice, in the absence of insulin resistance or changes in β-cell mass, emphasizes the important contribution that insulin secretory dysfunction makes in the pathogenesis of type-2 diabetes and further suggests that protection of β-cell function is a worthy consideration for the treatment of type-2 diabetes (2Lingohr M.K. Buettner R. Rhodes C.J. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 375-384Google Scholar). We thank Cynthia Jacobs for the preparation of this manuscript."

Using mutant cells partially responsive to dsRNA, we established conclusively that activation of NFκB, AP-1, p38, or JNK is not required for IRF-3 activation and consequent 561 mRNA induction. Thus, dsRNA uses a distinct IRF-3 pathway for activation of genes such as 561 (9Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4849) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that TLR3 is required for NFκB activation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by dsRNA. The TLR family of transmembrane receptors is an integral part of our innate immune system. They recognize, with high specificity, diverse pathogen-associated molecular patterns and elicit intracellular signals to cause cellular inflammatory responses (11Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6061) Google Scholar, 12Lien E. Ingalls R.R. Crit. Care Med. 2002; 30: S1-S11Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 13Jefferies C.A. O'Neill L.A. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2002; 2: 169-175Google Scholar). Although there are partial overlaps among the genes induced by different TLRs, their signaling pathways are thought to be distinct. However, the complete signaling pathway has not been elucidated for any TLR. In this study, we have investigated the role of TLR3 in the specific dsRNA-elicited signaling pathway that causes induction of the 561 gene. In the course of this investigation we have made the unexpected observation that specific tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3 are essential for this signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONTranscriptional induction by dsRNA of the 561 gene and other IFN-stimulated genes is mediated by members of the IRF family, primarily IRF-3 (1Sen G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 16Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is independent of dsRNA-mediated activation of IκB kinase, JNK, or p38 kinases, and it does not require the activities of transcription factors such as NFκB or AP-1 (9Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Alexopoulou et al. (10Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4849) Google Scholar) have shown that the 293 cells are devoid of the latter responses to dsRNA unless TLR3 is expressed in them by transfection. Here, we have established the same requirements for another dsRNA-elicited signaling pathway, which leads to 561 gene activation. To validate direct induction of the 561 gene by dsRNA in 293 cells, we performed the cycloheximide experiment (Fig. 1 B). Since the 561 gene and other genes of this family can also be induced by type I IFN, there was a possibility that the observed induction of 561 mRNA was mediated by intermediate IFN synthesis. However, if that were the case, the induction would have been inhibited by blocking new protein synthesis. In other cell types, such as HT1080 and GRE using genetic and biochemical approaches, we have previously shown that the 561 gene can be induced by dsRNA without any involvement of IFNs or their receptors (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Here, the same conclusion was formally established for 293/TLR3 cells as well. Thus, the 561 gene can be considered as a primary response gene for dsRNA in these cells. The fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could block 561 mRNA induction led us to study the role of Tyr residues of TLR3 in dsRNA signaling. Our study has established a possible connection between that susceptibility and TLR3 tyrosine residues.The transient reporter assay shown in Fig. 2 has been used by us before in other cells (5Bandyopadhyay S.K. Leonard Jr., G.T. Bandyopadhyay T. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19624-19629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 7Grandvaux N. Servant M.J. tenOever B. Sen G.C. Balachandran S. Barber G.N. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 5532-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In the 293 cells it was quite robust and reproducible with a low background. More importantly, it was totally dependent on the expression of transfected TLR3, thus offering us a convenient and rapid assay for mutant TLR3 functions. Taking advantage of this assay, we could establish the relative functional importance of the five tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3. It was clear that Tyr759 was the most critical residue, but for maximal activity of the promoter, the presence of another Tyr was needed. For this accessory function, the most membrane-proximal (733) or the most distal (858) Tyr residue was most effective, whereas the two other Tyr residues present near the Tyr759 (756 and 764) were less effective. The conclusions drawn from the reporter assays were confirmed by examining induction of the resident 561 gene in cell lines derived from 293 cells that expressed wt or mutant TLR3 proteins. Cells expressing the 5F and the YFFFY mutants were totally unresponsive, whereas those expressing the FFYFY mutant were as responsive as the wt cells (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the Y759F mutant were also unresponsive. The Y759F mutant, however, had some residual activity in the transient reporter assay (Fig. 2 B,line 17). This minor difference could be attributed to high overexpression of the transfected proteins in the transient assays. It could also be a genuine difference between the responses of the chromosomal gene and the transfected reporter gene driven by an arbitrarily truncated promoter. Thus, the lack of response of the resident 561 gene in cells expressing the Y759F protein is the more physiologically relevant result.We observed Tyr phosphorylation of wt-TLR3, but not of 5F-TLR3, in response to dsRNA treatment (Fig. 4). We do not know at this time which specific Tyr residues get phosphorylated nor do we know how rapidly it happens. It is tempting to speculate that the phosphotyrosine moieties serve as the docking sites for protein kinases or adaptor proteins, thereby starting a cascade of signaling events leading to activation of the relevant transcription factors. Drawing upon the knowledge of growth factor receptors, it is also conceivable that different tyrosine residues of TLR3 cytoplasmic domains attract different protein partners and hence initiate different independent signaling pathways (17Watowich S.S. Wu H. Socolovsky M. Klingmuller U. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 91-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and biochemical investigations will be required in the future to examine these possibilities. Irrespective of the mechanism, it is clear from this study that cytoplasmic tyrosine residues and their phosphorylation play an essential role in TLR3 signaling. This observation is highly significant, because tyrosine phosphorylation was not thought to be connected to the primary signaling pathway of any member of the TLR family. The only exception is TLR2, which has recently been shown to contain phosphotyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain (18Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In that case, however, the critical tyrosine residues have not been identified, but presumably they are required for the assembly of the signaling complex.

Thus, the 561 gene can be considered as a primary response gene for dsRNA in these cells. The fact that tyrosine kinase inhibitors could block 561 mRNA induction led us to study the role of Tyr residues of TLR3 in dsRNA signaling. Our study has established a possible connection between that susceptibility and TLR3 tyrosine residues.The transient reporter assay shown in Fig. 2 has been used by us before in other cells (5Bandyopadhyay S.K.

In the 293 cells it was quite robust and reproducible with a low background. More importantly, it was totally dependent on the expression of transfected TLR3, thus offering us a convenient and rapid assay for mutant TLR3 functions. Taking advantage of this assay, we could establish the relative functional importance of the five tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain of TLR3. It was clear that Tyr759 was the most critical residue, but for maximal activity of the promoter, the presence of another Tyr was needed. For this accessory function, the most membrane-proximal (733) or the most distal (858) Tyr residue was most effective, whereas the two other Tyr residues present near the Tyr759 (756 and 764) were less effective. The conclusions drawn from the reporter assays were confirmed by examining induction of the resident 561 gene in cell lines derived from 293 cells that expressed wt or mutant TLR3 proteins. Cells expressing the 5F and the YFFFY mutants were totally unresponsive, whereas those expressing the FFYFY mutant were as responsive as the wt cells (Fig. 3). Cells expressing the Y759F mutant were also unresponsive. The Y759F mutant, however, had some residual activity in the transient reporter assay (Fig. 2 B,line 17). This minor difference could be attributed to high overexpression of the transfected proteins in the transient assays. It could also be a genuine difference between the responses of the chromosomal gene and the transfected reporter gene driven by an arbitrarily truncated promoter. Thus, the lack of response of the resident 561 gene in cells expressing the Y759F protein is the more physiologically relevant result.We observed Tyr phosphorylation of wt-TLR3, but not of 5F-TLR3, in response to dsRNA treatment (Fig. 4). We do not know at this time which specific Tyr residues get phosphorylated nor do we know how rapidly it happens. It is tempting to speculate that the phosphotyrosine moieties serve as the docking sites for protein kinases or adaptor proteins, thereby starting a cascade of signaling events leading to activation of the relevant transcription factors. Drawing upon the knowledge of growth factor receptors, it is also conceivable that different tyrosine residues of TLR3 cytoplasmic domains attract different protein partners and hence initiate different independent signaling pathways (17Watowich S.S. Wu H. Socolovsky M. Klingmuller U. Constantinescu S.N. Lodish H.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 91-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic and biochemical investigations will be required in the future to examine these possibilities. Irrespective of the mechanism, it is clear from this study that cytoplasmic tyrosine residues and their phosphorylation play an essential role in TLR3 signaling. This observation is highly significant, because tyrosine phosphorylation was not thought to be connected to the primary signaling pathway of any member of the TLR family. The only exception is TLR2, which has recently been shown to contain phosphotyrosine residues in its cytoplasmic domain (18Arbibe L. Mira J.P. Teusch N. Kline L. Guha M. Mackman N. Godowski P.J. Ulevitch R.J. Knaus U.G. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 533-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In that case, however, the critical tyrosine residues have not been identified, but presumably they are required for the assembly of the signaling complex. Transcriptional induction by dsRNA of the 561 gene and other IFN-stimulated genes is mediated by members of the IRF family, primarily IRF-3 (1Sen G. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 255-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar, 16Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). This signaling pathway is independent of dsRNA-mediated activation of IκB kinase, JNK, or p38 kinases, and it does not require the activities of transcription factors such as NFκB or AP-1 (9Peters K.L. Smith H.L. Stark G.R. Sen G.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6322-6327Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Alexopoulou et al. (10Alexopoulou L. Holt A.C. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (4849) Google Scholar) have shown that the 293 cells are devoid of the latter responses to dsRNA unless TLR3 is expressed in them by transfection. Here, we have established the same requirements for another dsRNA-elicited signaling pathway, which leads to 561 gene activation. To validate direct induction of the 561 gene by dsRNA in 293 cells, we performed the cycloheximide experiment (Fig. 1 B). Since the 561 gene and other genes of this family can also be induced by type I IFN, there was a possibility that the observed induction of 561 mRNA was mediated by intermediate IFN synthesis. However, if that were the case, the induction would have been inhibited by blocking new protein synthesis. In other cell types, such as HT1080 and GRE using genetic and biochemical approaches, we have previously shown that the 561 gene can be induced by dsRNA without any involvement of IFNs or their receptors (5Bandyopadhyay S.K.

https://openalex.org/W2136334909,"Abstract Spatial and temporal regulation of intracellular Ca2+ is a key event in many signaling pathways. Plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) are major regulators of Ca2+ homeostasis and bind to PDZ (PSD-95/Dlg/ZO-1) domains via their C termini. Various membrane-associated guanylate kinase family members have been identified as interaction partners of PMCAs. In particular, SAP90/PSD95, PSD93/chapsyn-110, SAP97, and SAP102 all bind to the C-terminal tails of PMCA “b” splice variants. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that PMCA4b interacts with neuronal nitric-oxide synthase and that isoform 2b interacts with Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 2, both via a PDZ domain. CASK (calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase) contains a calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-like domain followed by PDZ, SH3, and guanylate kinase-like domains. In adult brain CASK is located at neuronal synapses and interacts with various proteins, e.g. neurexin and Veli/LIN-7. In kidney it is localized to renal epithelia. Surprisingly, interaction with the Tbr-1 transcription factor, nuclear transport, binding to DNA T-elements (in a complex with Tbr-1), and transcriptional competence has been shown. Here we show that the C terminus of PMCA4b binds to CASK and that both proteins co-precipitate from brain and kidney tissue lysates. Immunofluorescence staining revealed co-expression of PMCA, CASK, and calbindin-d-28K in distal tubuli of rat kidney sections. To test if physical interaction of both proteins results in functional consequences we constructed a T-element-dependent reporter vector and investigated luciferase activity in HEK293 lysates, previously co-transfected with PMCA4b expression and control vectors. Expression of wild-type PMCA resulted in an 80% decrease in T-element-dependent transcriptional activity, whereas co-expression of a point-mutated PMCA, with nearly eliminated Ca2+ pumping activity, had only a small influence on regulation of transcriptional activity. These results provide evidence of a new direct Ca2+-dependent link from the plasma membrane to the nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2079573461,"Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is characterized by the formation of hamartomas in multiple organs resulting from mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. Their protein products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, form a functional complex that affects cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Several lines of evidence, including renal tumors derived from TSC2+/− animals, suggest that the loss or inhibition of tuberin is associated with up-regulation of cyclin D1. As cyclin D1 can be regulated through the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, we hypothesize that the cell proliferative effects of hamartin and tuberin are partly mediated through β-catenin. In this study, total β-catenin protein levels were found to be elevated in the TSC2-related renal tumors. Ectopic expression of hamartin and wild-type tuberin, but not mutant tuberin, reduced β-catenin steady-state levels and its half-life. The TSC1-TSC2 complex also inhibited Wnt-1 stimulated Tcf/LEF luciferase reporter activity. This inhibition was eliminated by constitutively active β-catenin but not by Disheveled, suggesting that hamartin and tuberin function at the level of the β-catenin degradation complex. Indeed, hamartin and tuberin co-immunoprecipitated with glycogen synthase kinase 3 β and Axin, components of this complex in a Wnt-1-dependent manner. Our data suggest that hamartin and tuberin negatively regulate β-catenin stability and activity by participating in the β-catenin degradation complex.

Brain Dev. 1995; 17 (suppl.): 55-57Google Scholar). While the underlying pathogenic mechanisms are unclear, the histology of these discrete, tumor-like lesions suggests defects in cell proliferation, differentiation, and cell size control. Studies in mammalian cells have shown that overexpression of TSC1 and TSC2 negatively regulates cell proliferation and induces G1/S arrest (2Jin F. Wienecke R. Xiao G.H. Maize Jr., J.C. DeClue J.E.

In the case of tuberin, there appears to be an inverse correlation between tuberin level and p27(Kip1) expression and stability (5Soucek T. Yeung R.S. Hengstschlager M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15653-15658Google Scholar). Correspondingly, evidence supports a link between tuberin and cyclin D1 expression. Cortical tubers microdissected from TSC patients showed elevated cyclin D1 mRNA expression in the giant cells (6Crino P.B. Trojanowski J.Q. Dichter M.A. Eberwine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14152-14157Google Scholar). Antisense inhibition of TSC2 in Rat1 fibroblasts resulted in up-regulation of cyclin D1 protein (3Soucek T. Pusch O. Wienecke R. DeClue J.E. Hengstschlager M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29301-29308Google Scholar). Renal cortical tumors from the Eker rat model for TSC express elevated cyclin D1 compared with unaffected kidney tissue (7Kenerson H.L. Aicher L.D. True L.D. Yeung R.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5645-5650Google Scholar). As an in vivotarget of the β-catenin pathway, cyclin D1 mRNA is responsive to the activity of the Tcf/LEF family of transcription factors (8Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Google Scholar, 9Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar). This raises the possibility that TSC1 and TSC2 negatively regulate β-catenin signaling and, thereby, modulate the expression of cyclin D1. β-Catenin is a highly conserved 95-kDa protein that participates in cell-cell adhesion through its association with members of the membrane-bound cadherin family, and in cell proliferation and differentiation as a key component of the Wnt/Wingless pathway (reviewed in Ref. 10Daniels D.L. Ekolf Spink K. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Google Scholar). In its signaling role, β-catenin shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus where it binds the Tcf/LEF family of transcription factors to activate downstream target genes (reviewed in Ref. 11Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7860-7872Google Scholar). In the absence of the secreted factor, Wnt, β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3β and is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, Disheveled (Dsh) is activated and blocks the ability of GSK3β to phosphorylate β-catenin. Other components of this degradation complex include Axin, serving as a scaffolding protein, and APC, a tumor suppressor protein. Disruption at multiple levels of this pathway has been shown to be oncogenic in humans and rodents. In this study, β-catenin protein levels were found to be elevated in renal tumors from Eker rats. Overexpression of tuberin and hamartin in cells down-regulated β-catenin levels, its half-life and its activity. Furthermore, we showed that TSC1 and TSC2 proteins co-immunoprecipitated with GSK3β and Axin, supporting a role of hamartin and tuberin in modulating the β-catenin pathway. Eker rats harboring a germ-line TSC2 mutation were described previously (12Yeung R.S. Xiao G.H. Jin F. Lee W.C. Testa J.R. Knudson A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Radiolabeled [35S]methionine (EASYTAGTM express protein labeling mix) was purchased from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Eker rats were sacrificed at 12 months of age to collect kidney samples. Kidney lesions were dissected from unaffected tissue. Both were homogenized in cold RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.025m β-glycophosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.05 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm orthovanadatate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm microcystin LR), and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). SDS-PAGE and Western blots were performed using equal amounts of total protein. HEK293T cells were transfected with increasing concentrations of TSC1 and TSC2 (wild-type or ΔY1571H mutant) vectors or with control vector (pcDNA3) (500, 1000, and 1500 ng) either with or without Wnt-1 vector using LipofectAMINE Plus reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. Empty plasmids were added accordingly to normalize total DNA transfected. The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mmPMSF) and lysed by freeze thawing at 48 h after transfection. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Vectors encoding TSC1, TSC2, or TSC2 (ΔY1571H) mutant were co-transfected into HEK293T cells with or without Wnt-1. After 48 h, pulse-chase using [35S]methionine incorporation was performed on transfected cells as outlined by Williams et al. (21Williams B.O. Barish G.D. Klymkowsky M.W. Varmus H.E.

Equal amounts of cell lysate were adjusted to equal volumes, pretreated with ConA-Sepharose (1:1 in immunoprecipitation buffer, see below) (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) and then subjected to immunoprecipitation for β-catenin. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography. Radiolabel band intensities were determined using a PhosphorImager Storm 840 (AmershamBiosciences). Cells (HEK293T) were transfected with the Tcf/LEF reporter construct (TOPFLASH) (18Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H.

Luciferase activity was analyzed using an EG&G Berthold Autolumet LB953 luminometer (PerkinElmer Instruments, Bad Wildbad, Germany), and normalized to corresponding β-galactosidase values. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected Wnt-1 construct or empty vector. Similarly, for ectopically expressed proteins, HEK293T cells were transfected with TSC1 and TSC2 vectors or pcDNA3 (vector control) in the presence of vectors for GSK3β or c-Myc-tagged Axin. Cells were harvested the following day in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.0 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.2 mmPMSF). Equal total amounts of lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-tuberin polyclonal antibody, anti-GSK monoclonal antibody, or anti-c-Myc antibodies as described previously (14Aicher L.D.

In a previous study, cyclin D1 levels were shown to be elevated in these kidney tumors compared with unaffected kidney tissue (7Kenerson H.L. Aicher L.D. True L.D. Yeung R.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5645-5650Google Scholar). Since cyclin D1 gene is a known target of the β-catenin signaling pathway and the accumulation of β-catenin has been shown to activate the transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (8Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Google Scholar, 9Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar). β-Catenin levels were examined in Eker rat kidney tumors. Tumors from three separate Eker rats were dissected from unaffected tissue, homogenized, and analyzed by Western blotting for β-catenin expression. As shown in Fig.1 A, β-catenin levels are higher in tumor samples compared with corresponding unaffected kidney tissue, reflecting the trend observed for cyclin D1. Thus β-catenin appears to accumulate upon TSC2 inactivation implying that tuberin may affect β-catenin levels. To investigate a possible link between tuberin and the β-catenin signaling pathway, we analyzed the effects of tuberin expression on β-catenin steady-state levels. Endogenous β-catenin expression was assessed in HEK293T cells 48 h after transfection with increasing concentrations of TSC1 and TSC2 or control vectors in the presence or absence of Wnt-1 stimulation. In the absence of Wnt-1 stimulation, β-catenin levels were unchanged with or without overexpression of hamartin and tuberin (data not shown). Upon Wnt-1 stimulation, β-catenin accumulated over a 48-h period in vector control samples (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1–4). However, β-catenin levels were significantly reduced with overexpression of wild-type tuberin and hamartin (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 1–7). In contrast, overexpression of a disease-causing TSC2 mutant (ΔY1571H) (14Aicher L.D. Campbell J.S. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21017-21021Google Scholar) resulted in a modest β-catenin accumulation (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 8–10). These results show an inverse relationship between β-catenin and hamartin/tuberin expression. With increasing expression of hamartin and wild-type tuberin, β-catenin levels diminished progressively (Fig.1 B, compare lanes 5–7). In contrast, steady-state β-catenin increased modestly with the expression of control vector (Fig. 1 B, compare lanes 2–4) or with mutant tuberin (ΔY1571H) (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 8–10). Next, we examined the effect of hamartin and tuberin expression on β-catenin half-life. HEK293T cells were transfected as described above and then subjected to pulse-chase following [35S]methionine incorporation. Lysates collected at specific time points were treated with ConA-Sepharose to remove cadherin-bound β-catenin leaving only the free pool of β-catenin for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the radiolabel intensity of [35S]methionine incorporated in to β-catenin was measured from the gel to determine the half-life. Without Wnt-1 stimulation, β-catenin half-life was unchanged either with or without expression of hamartin and tuberin (data not shown). With Wnt-1 stimulation, the half-life of β-catenin in vector control samples was 1.7 h (Fig. 1 C). This was the same for β-catenin in samples overexpressing hamartin and mutant tuberin (ΔY1571H) (Fig. 1 C). However, the half-life of β-catenin was reduced to about 1 h upon expression of hamartin and wild-type tuberin (Fig. 1 C). This 41% decrease in β-catenin half-life is consistent with the steady-state data showing an effect of the TSC proteins on β-catenin level. In both situations, modulation of β-catenin by wild-type tuberin occurred under condition of Wnt stimulation. This function is disrupted in the presence of a disease-causing TSC2 mutation. To determine whether modulation of β-catenin levels by hamartin and tuberin affects its transcriptional activity, the ability of Wnt-1 to activate a Tcf/LEF-luciferase reporter construct (TOPFLASH) was examined in transient transfection assays using HEK293T cells. These cells were co-transfected with hamartin and/or tuberin constructs along with a vector for β-galactosidase to account for transfection efficiency. Parallel assays were performed using FOPFLASH, a mutant reporter, to monitor background activity. Upon stimulation with Wnt-1, cells with vector control revealed a 12-fold increase in luciferase activity relative to the non-stimulated cells (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 1and 2). Co-expression of both wild-type tuberin and hamartin in Wnt-1 stimulated cells significantly reduced reporter activity (Fig.2 A, lane 3), while expression of hamartin or tuberin alone had only minor effects (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5 and 6). Importantly, co-expression of the tuberin ΔY1571H mutant with hamartin did not suppress Wnt-1-stimulated TOPFLASH activity (Fig. 2 A, lane 4) consistent with the effects on β-catenin protein levels described above (Fig. 1,B and C). Under the same conditions, hamartin and tuberin had no effects on FOPFLASH activity (Fig. 2 A,lanes 7 and 8). Our data suggest that hamartin and tuberin, functioning as a complex, are capable of inhibiting Wnt-1 stimulated β-catenin-dependent transcriptional activity. To determine at what level in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway hamartin and tuberin act, we examined the effects of TSC1 and TSC2 on TOPFLASH activity when stimulated by different components of the Wnt pathway. The CA-β-catenin mutant with its serine/threonine residues (Ser-33, Ser-37, Thr-41, Ser-45) replaced with alanine residues, thus preventing its phosphorylation and degradation (16Yost C. Torres M. Miller J.R. Huang E. Kimelman D. Moon R.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1443-1454Google Scholar), acts as a downstream stimulus and activates the TOPFLASH reporter by over 6-fold in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of hamartin and tuberin was ineffective in reducing CA-β-catenin stimulation of the Tcf/LEF reporter (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 2and 3). Western blot of samples confirmed equal expression of CA-β-catenin (data not shown). As a control, a dominant negative mutant of Tcf-4 (ΔN-Tcf-4) that lacks the N-terminal β-catenin binding domain (18Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Google Scholar) was able to inhibit CA-β-catenin activity completely (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). These results suggest that hamartin and tuberin act upstream of β-catenin. Next, TOPFLASH activity was measured in the presence of ectopically expressed Dsh, an effector that is stimulated by the Wnt-Frizzled receptor complex upstream of β-catenin (see Ref. 10Daniels D.L. Ekolf Spink K. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of Dsh stimulates TOPFLASH activity by ∼3-fold in control vector transfected cells (Fig. 2 C, comparelanes 1 and 2). This activity was inhibited to near baseline levels upon overexpression of hamartin and tuberin (Fig.2 C, lane 3). Hamartin alone did not reduce the activity, while tuberin alone slightly decreased activity (Fig.2 C, lanes 4 and 5). Again, ΔN-Tcf-4 reduced activity toward unstimulated levels (Fig. 2 C,lane 6). Together, these results are consistent with tuberin and hamartin exerting an effect on the Wnt signaling pathway at a level between Dsh and β-catenin (i.e. the β-catenin degradation complex). The β-catenin degradation complex is comprised of several proteins, including APC, Axin, and GSK3β, and is responsible for the regulation of cytoplasmic β-catenin (see Ref. 10Daniels D.L. Ekolf Spink K. Weis W.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 672-678Google Scholar). To determine whether hamartin and tuberin physically interact with components of the β-catenin degradation complex, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in HEK293T cells ectopically expressing hamartin and tuberin along with GSK3β. Anti-tuberin antibodies brought down GSK3β only in samples where both were overexpressed (Fig. 3 A,panel i, lane 4). This band was not observed in samples where the GSK3β construct was co-expressed with vector control (Fig. 3 A, panel i, lane 2) or in samples without the GSK3β construct (Fig. 3 A,panel i, lanes 1 and 3). As expected, hamartin co-immunoprecipitated with tuberin in sample where both were overexpressed (Fig. 3 A, panel ii, lanes 3 and 4). Conversely, immunoprecipitation of GSK3β brought down both tuberin and hamartin only in samples where all three were overexpressed (Fig. 3 A, panels iv andv, lane 4). The expression of ectopic proteins was verified in cell lysates (Fig. 3 A, panels vii, viii, and ix). Compared with the level of overexpression, the amount of interacting protein was relatively small, suggesting that only a fraction of tuberin/hamartin and GSK3β can associate with one another. If hamartin and tuberin interact with the GSK3β that function in the β-catenin degradation complex, one would predict that other components of the complex such as Axin would co-immunoprecipitate with hamartin and tuberin. To test this hypothesis, hamartin and tuberin were ectopically expressed in the presence of c-Myc-tagged Axin and then subjected to immunoprecipitation analyses. Using anti-tuberin and anti-c-Myc antibodies, tuberin and tagged Axin co-precipitated in samples where they were both overexpressed (Fig. 3 B,panels i and v, lanes 5 and6). Hamartin also co-immunoprecipitated with Axin (Fig.3 B, panel vi, lanes 5 and6). Tuberin, hamartin, and c-Myc-tagged Axin were not detected in vector control samples (Fig. 3 B, panels i, iii, v, and vi, lanes 1–3) or in samples without the tagged construct (Fig.3 B, panels i, iii, v, andvi, lane 4). We conclude that the tuberin-hamartin complex can associate with GSK3β and Axin possibly as part of the β-catenin degradation complex. Finally, to examine whether tuberin interacts with the endogenous GSK3β complex, co-immunoprecipitation assays were performed in HEK293T cells with and without Wnt stimulation. A band corresponding to GSK3β was found to co-immunoprecipitate with tuberin but not in preimmune serum control samples (Fig. 3 C, comparelanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, the amount of co-immunoprecipitated GSK3β was reduced upon Wnt-1 stimulation (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 1 and 2), suggesting that this interaction can be modulated by Wnt-1. The TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes have recently been implicated to play a role in negatively regulating mTOR in the PI3K signaling cascade (23Goncharova E.A. Goncharov D.A. Eszterhas A. Hunter D.S. Glassberg M.K. Yeung R.S. Walker C.L. Noonan D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Chou M.M. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Krymskaya V.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30958-30967Google Scholar, 24Manning B.D. Tee A.R. Logsdon M.N. Blenis J. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 151-162Google Scholar). As a result, tumors secondary to the inactivation of these genes have elevated levels of p70 S6 kinase activity that is reversible by rapamycin, a specific mTOR inhibitor (7Kenerson H.L. Aicher L.D. True L.D. Yeung R.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5645-5650Google Scholar). While this pathway may explain some of the complex phenotype exhibited by TSC pathology (i.e. cell size abnormalities), alteration in other cellular functions may involve additional mechanisms. Up-regulation of cyclin D1 mRNA and protein has been noted in CNS and renal lesions (6Crino P.B. Trojanowski J.Q. Dichter M.A. Eberwine J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14152-14157Google Scholar, 7Kenerson H.L. Aicher L.D. True L.D. Yeung R.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5645-5650Google Scholar), but a recent study using rapamycin in the Eker rat model of TSC failed to show a significant change in cyclin D1 or p27 levels despite anti-tumor response (7Kenerson H.L. Aicher L.D. True L.D. Yeung R.S. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5645-5650Google Scholar). Here, we describe an alternative pathway that may be relevant to the abnormalities observed in cell proliferation and differentiation. Our data show that in vivo levels of β-catenin are elevated upon disruption of TSC2 in renal tumors from Eker rats. Also, hamartin and tuberin reduce Wnt stimulation of β-catenin half-life and its downstream Tcf/LEF transcriptional activation. The results further suggest that tuberin and hamartin associate with the GSK3β degradation complex in a Wnt-1-dependent manner. These findings are in contrast to those of Kugoh et al. (25Kugoh H. Kleymenova E. Walker C.L. Mol. Carcinog. 2002; 33: 131-136Google Scholar) who reported a lack of change in Tcf-dependent luciferase activities in tuberin-null cells compared with controls. However, these experiments were conducted in the absence of Wnt stimulation. In our model, TSC1 and TSC2 complex with GSK3β to promote β-catenin degradation. Upon Wnt stimulation, tuberin dissociates from this complex resulting in stabilization of cytoplasmic β-catenin. As a known target of β-catenin signaling, the cyclin D1 gene contains Tcf responsive elements in its promoter and its expression is, in part, dependent on β-catenin activity (8Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Google Scholar, 9Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Google Scholar). We postulate that in the absence of functional tuberin or hamartin, stimulation of the β-catenin pathway will be unopposed resulting in the sustained transcriptional activation of cyclin D1. However, at this point, we cannot exclude the influence of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway on cyclin D1 regulation. There is growing evidence that there exists substantial cross-talk between the Wnt and PI3K signaling pathways. For example, Wnt stimulation increases Akt activity resulting in GSK3β phosphorylation and β-catenin stabilization (26Fukumoto S. Hsieh C.M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Yet S.F. Lee K.H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17479-17483Google Scholar). This function of Akt is distinct from its effects on the PI3K pathway and is dependent on the recruitment of Dsh to the GSK3β-β-catenin-Axin complex (26Fukumoto S. Hsieh C.M. Maemura K. Layne M.D. Yet S.F. Lee K.H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Taylor W.G. Rubin J.S. Perrella M.A. Lee M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17479-17483Google Scholar). It is conceivable that upon stimulation, activated Akt phosphorylates tuberin and disables it from the complex. Accordingly, tuberin acting downstream of Akt may play a role in coordinating signals tranduced through the Wnt and PI3K pathways, thus providing a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in tuberous sclerosis. The molecular components and their regulation by which TSC1 and TSC2 interact with the GSK3β complex remain to be identified. We thank David Kimelman for providing the GSK3β construct and members of the Yeung laboratory for critical reading and assistance in the preparation of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1984857402,"Protein B23 is a multifunctional nucleolar protein whose molecular chaperone activity is proposed to play role in ribosome assembly. Previous studies (Szebeni, A., and Olson, M. O. J. (1999) Protein Sci. 8, 905–912) showed that protein B23 has several characteristics typical of molecular chaperones, including anti-aggregation activity, promoting the renaturation of denatured proteins, and preferential binding to denatured substrates. However, until now there has been no proposed mechanism for release of a bound substrate. Protein B23 can be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (CK2) in a segment required for chaperone activity. The presence of bound substrate enhanced the rate of CK2 phosphorylation of protein B23 by 2–3-fold, and this enhancement was dependent on a nonpolar region in its N-terminal end. Formation of a complex between B23 and chaperone test substrates (rhodanese or citrate synthase) was inhibited by CK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, CK2 phosphorylation of a previously formed B23-substrate complex promoted its dissociation. The dissociation of complexes between B23 and the human immunodeficiency virus-Rev protein required both CK2 phosphorylation and competition with a Rev nuclear localization signal peptide, suggesting that Rev binds B23 at two separate sites. These studies suggest that unlike many molecular chaperones, which directly hydrolyze ATP, substrate release by protein B23 is dependent on its phosphorylation by CK2. Protein B23 is a multifunctional nucleolar protein whose molecular chaperone activity is proposed to play role in ribosome assembly. Previous studies (Szebeni, A., and Olson, M. O. J.

These studies suggest that unlike many molecular chaperones, which directly hydrolyze ATP, substrate release by protein B23 is dependent on its phosphorylation by CK2. The nucleolus is the subcellular domain for the assembly of ribosomal subunits in which the initial building blocks are preribosomal RNA, 5 S rRNA, and ribosomal and nonribosomal proteins (1Olson M.O.J. Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2002; 219: 199-266Google Scholar). This is a complex, multistep process that takes place in an environment that is likely to contain high concentrations of macromolecules. Although the concentrations in the various compartments of the nucleolus are not known, they are likely to be at least as high as and probably much higher than the estimated overall cellular macromolecular concentration of 200–300 mg/ml (2Ellis J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 597-604Google Scholar). At these concentrations proteins are faced with the potential problems of denaturation, aggregation, and immobilization as they participate in ribosome biogenesis. In addition to the macromolecular crowding effect, the process of incorporation of proteins into preribosomal complexes could expose hydrophobic surfaces and so further increase the probability for aggregation. Such a tendency to aggregate is usually relieved by the action of a variety of molecular chaperones (3Leroux M.R. Hartl F.U. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 364-405Google Scholar), and it seems likely that specialized molecular chaperones exist in the nucleolus to aid in ribosome assembly. In fact, recent proteomic analyses of nucleoli identified 14 potential molecular chaperones in HeLa cell nucleoli (4Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Google Scholar). These could be important in preventing aggregation of proteins in the nucleolus. To date, one nucleolar protein has been shown to have a general molecular chaperone activity by several criteria. Szebeni and Olson (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar) tested a nucleolar nonribosomal protein called B23 (also called NO38, nucleophosmin/NPM, or numatrin) for chaperone activity using several protein substrates typically used to test proteins for chaperone activity. Protein B23 was found to prevent aggregation of the HIV-1 1The abbreviations used are: HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; CK2, protein kinase CK2 (also known as casein kinase II); NLS, nuclear localization signal; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography Rev protein and also to suppress the aggregation of several other proteins during thermal denaturation. In addition, B23 preserves enzyme activities under high temperature conditions and actually promotes the renaturation and restoration of activities of enzymes previously denatured with guanidine-HCl. Finally, protein B23 preferentially binds denatured substrates; this is accompanied by an increase in exposure of the hydrophobic regions of the proteins in the B23-substrate complexes. A histone chaperone activity has also been proposed for protein B23, based on the observation that it binds to histones and mediates the formation of nucleosomes (6Okuwaki M. Matsumoto K. Tsujimoto M. Nagata K. FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 272-276Google Scholar). Because protein B23 is predominantly localized in nucleolus, it is believed to serve as a factor in ribosome biogenesis. Protein B23 binds RNA and DNA (7Wang D. Baumann A. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30994-30998Google Scholar) and interacts with other nucleolar proteins, including nucleolin (8Li Y.P. Busch R.K. Valdez B.C. Busch H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 153-158Google Scholar), protein P120 (9Valdez B.C. Perlaky L. Henning D. Saijo Y. Chan P.K. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23776-23783Google Scholar), and the HIV-1 Rev protein (10Fankhauser C. Izaurralde E. Adachi Y. Wingfield P. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2567-2575Google Scholar, 11Umekawa H. Chang J.H. Correia J.J. Wang D. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 635-645Google Scholar). It has intrinsic endoribonuclease activity (12Herrera J.E. Savkur R. Olson M.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3974-3979Google Scholar), and its capacity to preferentially cleave in the ITS2 region of pre-rRNA suggests that it could participate in late stages of ribosome biogenesis (13Savkur R.S. Olson M.O.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4508-4515Google Scholar). In addition, protein B23 seems to have multiple functions outside of the nucleolus. The ability of the protein to shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm (14Borer R.A. Lehner C.F. Eppenberger H.M. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Google Scholar) and to bind nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing peptides (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar) suggests a role in nuclear import. In support of this latter notion, protein B23 has been shown to stimulate the import of NLS-containing proteins into isolated nuclei (16Szebeni A. Mehrotra B. Baumann A. Adam S.A. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3941-3949Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this ability is related to its molecular chaperone activity (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). The protein also stimulates the activity of DNA polymerase α (17Umekawa H. Sato K. Takemura M. Watanabe Y. Usui S. Takahashi T. Yoshida S. Olson M.O.J. Furuichi Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 130: 199-205Google Scholar), and it may serve a factor in DNA recombination through its capacity to promote annealing of complementary strands of DNA (18Borggrefe T. Wabl M. Akhmedov A.T. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17025-17035Google Scholar). Finally, protein B23 seems to control the duplication of centrosomes in mammalian cells (19Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations have led researchers to conclude that B23 is a multifunctional protein with roles both in and outside of the nucleolus. Molecular chaperones are a diverse group of proteins that share the common general function of modulating protein conformation (20Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1559-1569Google Scholar). They appear to operate through repeated cycles of binding partially unfolded substrates, release of the bound substrate, and folding after release until the correct conformation is achieved (21Buchner J.B. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 10-19Google Scholar). Typically, substrate release by chaperones is coupled to ATP hydrolysis (20Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1559-1569Google Scholar). Like the molecular chaperones in general, protein B23 preferentially binds denatured substrates (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). However, protein B23 does not directly hydrolyze ATP and, until now, a mechanism for release of substrate had not been found. Protein B23 has been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro(22Chan P.K. Aldrich M. Cook R.G. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1868-1872Google Scholar) and in vivo (23Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Google Scholar) by protein kinase CK2 (CK2). Furthermore, the CK2 sites are located in a segment of the molecule that is essential for chaperone activity (24Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Google Scholar). Therefore, we considered the possibility that phosphorylation of protein B23 by CK2 could promote the release of bound substrates. Here we report a possible mechanism for the dissociation of a substrate from protein B23. Phosphorylation of the B23-substrate complex by CK2 alters the interaction of B23 with denatured proteins and promotes their release from the complex. In this mechanism, the release of the chaperone substrate appears to be indirectly dependent on hydrolysis of ATP. Because CK2 and protein phosphatases are present in the nucleus and nucleolus, cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation could control the binding and release of substrate proteins in vivo. This mechanism has not previously been observed in other molecular chaperones. Recombinant rat proteins B23.1 and B23.2 used in these studies were produced in Escherichia coli and purified essentially as previously described (11Umekawa H. Chang J.H. Correia J.J. Wang D. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 635-645Google Scholar) except that the respective cDNAs were inserted into the pET 11c vector (Novagen) for expression. Recombinant deletion mutants (ΔC35, ΔN35, ΔN90, and ΔN119) were expressed using the Qiagen pQE-30 vector and purified as described by Hingorani et al. (24Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Google Scholar). The mutant protein B23, where the CK2 phosphorylation site was changed to alanine (S125A), was prepared using the SOEing technique as previously described (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar) and expressed in the pQE-31 vector as above. The cDNA for the HIV-1 Rev protein was cloned into the pET11c vector (Novagen), and the recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli, and it was purified from bacterial extracts essentially as reported by Karn et al. (25Karn J. Churcher M.J. Rittner K. Kelley A. Butler P.J.G. Mann D.A. Gait M.J. Karn J. HIV: A Practical Approach, Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Drug Discovery. 2. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 147-165Google Scholar). The purified protein was refolded as described by Wingfield et al. (26Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Payton M.A. Venkatesan S. Misra M. Steven A.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7527-7534Google Scholar). Peptides based on the NLS sequence of the HIV-1 Rev protein were synthesized by Coast Scientific: NLS (residues 37–47); rNLS (residues 37–47, reverse order). The monoclonal antibody to protein B23 was a gift from Dr. P. K. Chan of Baylor College of Medicine. Protein B23 was labeled with125I as previously described by Szebeni et al.(16Szebeni A. Mehrotra B. Baumann A. Adam S.A. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3941-3949Google Scholar). Recombinant protein B23 or its mutants were phosphorylatedin vitro with CK2 from Roche Molecular Biochemicals or recombinant CK2 α subunit, generously provided by Dr. Khalil Ahmed (Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Minneapolis MN); there were no significant differences observed between the two enzyme preparations. For CK2 phosphorylation samples of protein B23 or mutants (0.3 mg/ml) were incubated in a reaction mixture containing ∼1 milliunits/ml CK2, 20 mm MES buffer (pH 7.2), 130 mm KCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, 48 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm ATP in a total volume of 1 ml at 30 or 37 °C. The enzyme reaction was linear for at least 30 min. The number of phosphoryl groups incorporated into the protein was calculated from the radioisotope incorporation, the specific activity of the [γ-32P]ATP, and the amount of protein as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar). For the preparations of B23 used for the studies examining the effect of phosphorylation on B23-substrate complex formation, the incubations were carried out for 60 min; under these conditions there was incorporation of an average of ∼1.2 phosphoryl groups per molecule (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar). Protein B23 was phosphorylated by a cdc2-type kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) as described by Szebeniet al. (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar). Enzyme activities of citrate synthase and rhodanese were measured as indicated in a previous study (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of protein B23-substrate complexes was performed according to a previously published procedure (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). Phosphorylated mixtures of B23 and rhodanese were digested with 20 units of mouse submaxillary gland endoproteinase Arg-C (Calbiochem) for 8 h at 37 °C in 1% NaHCO3 (pH 8.0). Aliquots of the digestion products were run on SDS-PAGE gels containing 20% polyacrylamide, and the Coomassie-stained gels were subjected to phosphorimaging. The samples were also digested for 24 h with 0.03 mg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma) using the same buffer and temperature conditions as above. The digested mixtures were subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column (Vydac 218MS54) and a gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and subjected to scintillation counting. The major phosphorylation site of rat protein B23 by CK2 (serine 125) is located in the first highly acidic segment of the protein (22Chan P.K. Aldrich M. Cook R.G. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1868-1872Google Scholar). Another potential phosphorylation site (threonine 185) is found in the second highly acidic segment. These sites are part of the region essential for maximal chaperone activity (24Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Google Scholar) and their phosphorylation could be altered by the presence of bound substrate. Therefore, we examined the effect of bound, heat-denatured proteins to protein B23 on its phosphorylation by CK2. Rhodanese, which was previously used as a substrate to test chaperone activity, was incubated at an equimolar ratio with protein B23 for 20 min at 65 °C to form a complex. Incorporation of 32P from [γ-32P]ATP into the complex catalyzed by CK2 was monitored in the linear phase of the reaction (Fig.1 A). The presence of denatured rhodanese in the complex accelerated the rate of incorporation ∼2-fold compared with the heated control without rhodanese. Because heat treatment of protein B23 alone did not enhance the rate of incorporation of 32P, the binding of the substrate must be responsible for the increased rate of phosphorylation. In control samples, in which MgCl2 was omitted from the otherwise complete reaction mixture, there was no significant incorporation of32P in either the unheated or heated sample. This indicated that nonspecific adsorption of labeled ATP was not responsible for the enhanced rate of phosphorylation. Similar experiments were performed using two other proteins, citrate synthase (heated at 50 °C) and the HIV-1 Rev protein (heated to 30 °C). The results were generally very similar to those obtained with rhodanese, with 2–3-fold stimulation of the rate of phosphorylation (Fig. 1, B and C). To ensure that the enhanced rate of phosphorylation was not because of incorporation of phosphate into nonspecific sites, phosphopeptide mapping studies were done on the phosphorylated protein mixtures. Protein B23 was phosphorylated with CK2 and [γ-32P]ATP for 60 min in the presence of rhodanese either before or after heating the mixture at 65 °C. Under the conditions of phosphorylation, CK2 alone did not incorporate significant label (Fig.2 A, lane 1) due to autophosphorylation. The labeling patterns of the heated and unheated, undigested B23-rhodanese mixtures treated with CK2 were virtually identical, with incorporation predominantly into the protein B23 band, with traces of label in degradation products or minor contaminants (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2 and 4). There was no significant incorporation into rhodanese (location indicated), and there were no differences in labeling patterns between heated and unheated samples. When the samples were subjected to digestion with endoproteinase Arg-C only one major band was obtained in either case (lanes 3 and 5). The molecular mass of the phosphopeptide cleavage product of endoproteinase Arg-C was estimated to be ∼5 kDa; this fits with the molecular mass of the fragment between residues 102 and 142. Because this segment contains only one serine residue, the presence of this cleavage product supports the notion that only one serine residue is phosphorylated by CK2. To confirm that there were no additional sites labeled when the heat-treated B23-substrate complex was phosphorylated with CK2, similar experiments were done with tryptic digestion. In this case, the reverse phase HPLC elution profiles of the untreated and heat-treated samples were virtually identical, with only one peak of radioactivity (Fig.2 B). These studies indicate that the presence of the denatured substrate did not expose additional sites to nonspecific phosphorylation by CK2, and only serine 125 is phosphorylated by CK2 under these conditions (see Ref. 22Chan P.K. Aldrich M. Cook R.G. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1868-1872Google Scholar). Protein B23 has also been shown to be phosphorylated in the C-terminal region by a cdc2-type protein kinase (23Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Google Scholar). To determine whether the effect seen with CK2 in the presence of denatured proteins was specific or was due to phosphorylation in general, protein B23 was also incubated with a cdc2-type protein kinase. When the complex was phosphorylated by the cdc2-type kinase there was no significant increase in the rate of incorporation of radioactivity into protein B23 in the presence of any of the three denatured chaperone substrates mentioned above (data not shown). Thus, the effect of complex formation on the rate of phosphorylation is specific to the CK2 sites. Protein B23 has several distinctive segments and functional domains in its primary structure including a nonpolar N-terminal domain, a basic C-terminal region, and two highly acidic segments in the middle. Previous studies (24Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Google Scholar) showed that maximal molecular chaperone activity requires nonpolar and acidic segments in the N-terminal half of the polypeptide chain (see the schematic in Fig.3 A). To determine whether specific segments are also important for stimulation of phosphorylation of protein B23 by CK2, we tested this effect using the B23.2 isoform and the ΔC35, ΔN35, ΔN90, ΔN119 deletion mutants (Fig.3 A). The CK2 phosphorylation experiments were performed on the B23.2 isoform and on the deletion mutants in the presence and absence of the denatured rhodanese substrate as above. In these experiments the rates of phosphorylation of proteins B23.1, B23.2, the C-terminal deletion mutant ΔC35, or the N-terminal deletion mutant ΔN35 were enhanced almost 3-fold by the presence of denatured rhodanese, with no significant differences among the four forms of the protein (Fig.3 B). In contrast, rates of labeling of the ΔN90 and ΔN119 deletion mutants by CK2 in the presence of the denatured substrate were similar to that of the control, i.e. there was no enhancement of the rate of phosphorylation. Because the nonpolar region in the N-terminal half of protein B23 is absent in the latter two mutants, these experiments confirm that this segment is essential not only for optimal chaperone activity but also for the substrate-induced enhancement of CK2 phosphorylation of the protein. One of the characteristics of protein B23 that is typical of molecular chaperones is its preference for binding denatured substrates (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). The formation of the complex between denatured substrate and protein B23 seems to be largely dependent on hydrophobic interactions between the proteins. In this complex, the substrate is seemingly irreversibly bound to protein B23. To determine whether CK2 phosphorylation of protein B23 could facilitate dissociation of the substrate, we examined the unmodified and phosphorylated complexes by sedimentation analyses. Equimolar mixtures of 125I-labeled control or CK2-phosphorylated protein B23 and rhodanese were heated and layered onto sucrose gradients and subjected to ultracentrifugation. The gradients were fractionated, and enzyme activity and radioactivity were measured in each fraction (Fig.4). When rhodanese and B23 were mixed at room temperature they sedimented as separate peaks (Fig.4 A), indicating a lack of interaction, as previously shown (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). Heating the mixture at 60 °C caused the proteins to sediment essentially as a single peak (Fig. 4 B). However, when phosphorylated protein B23 and rhodanese were heated together at 60 °C the two proteins again sedimented as separate peaks (Fig.4 C). Similar results were obtained with a CK2-phosphorylated B23-citrate synthase complex analyzed under similar conditions (Fig. 4,D–F). In control experiments, mock phosphorylations of B23 were performed in the absence of CK2, ATP, or MgCl2 before heating with the substrate; under these conditions B23 and the substrate protein sedimented together (Fig. 4, G–I). This indicates that the phosphorylation reaction was essential for dissociation of the B23-substrate complex, which was not promoted simply by the presence of CK2, ATP, or MgCl2. To confirm phosphorylation at the CK2 site (Ser-125) experiments similar to the ones above were performed using a mutant protein in which Ser-125 was converted to alanine (S125A). In these experiments there was no dissociation of the B23-substrate complex after treatment with CK2 either with rhodanese (Fig.5 C) or with citrate synthase (Fig. 5 F). This result strengthens the case that phosphorylation of Ser-125 of protein B23 is essential for dissociation of the bound substrate. Taken together, the results of this series of experiments indicate that CK2-phosphorylated protein B23 has greatly reduced affinity for the denatured substrates. Because the presence of a bound substrate enhances B23 phosphorylation and phosphorylated B23 has reduced affinity for the substrate, we considered the possibility that phosphorylation of a preformed complex could also promote its dissociation. To answer this question, experiments were performed in which an equimolar mixture of125I-labeled protein B23 and rhodanese was heated as above, and the resulting complex was phosphorylated by CK2. Aliquots were taken for sedimentation analysis at various times after initiation of the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 6). With each time point after the addition of CK2, there was an increase in the level of phosphorylation and a corresponding increase in the proportion of the two components dissociated from the complex. At the 5- and 15-min time points, ∼0.1 and 0.7 mol of phosphate were incorporated per mol of B23, respectively. About 9 and 65% of the rhodanese was dissociated from the complex at the 5- and 15-min time points, respectively. When the complex was phosphorylated for 60 min, the molar ratio of phosphate to B23 was ∼1.2, with greater than 95% dissociation of the complex (data not shown). Thus, phosphorylation of protein B23 by CK2 not only inhibits its ability to form a complex with a denatured substrate, but it also is able to promote the dissociation of a preformed complex in a manner that is roughly proportional to the level of phosphorylation. Studies using B23 mutants (Fig. 3) indicated that the nonpolar N-terminal end of the protein is required for chaperone activity and suggested that this region binds denatured protein substrates (24Hingorani K. Szebeni A. Olson M.O.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24451-24457Google Scholar). To determine whether this segment is required for substrate binding, we performed the sedimentation analyses with the ΔN35, ΔN90, and ΔC35 deletion mutants. These experiments showed that removal of a short segment from the N-terminal end of the protein (ΔN35) had no effect on the binding of denatured substrate (Fig.7 B). As with the wild type protein, phosphorylation by CK2 promoted dissociation of the complex (Fig. 7 C). Essentially the same set of results was obtained with the ΔC35 deletion mutant (data not shown). In contrast, the ΔN90 deletion mutant was unable to bind denatured rhodanese, which aggregated and lost its enzyme activity during thermal denaturation (Fig. 7 E). As expected, the same result was seen with phosphorylated ΔN90 (Fig. 7 F). This observation confirms that the N-terminal region protein B23 is essential for substrate binding as well as for the phosphorylation enhancement effect. Earlier experiments (10Fankhauser C. Izaurralde E. Adachi Y. Wingfield P. Laemmli U.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2567-2575Google Scholar, 11Umekawa H. Chang J.H. Correia J.J. Wang D. Wingfield P.T. Olson M.O.J. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1993; 39: 635-645Google Scholar) showed that there is a strong affinity between nonphosphorylated protein B23 and the HIV Rev protein and that protein B23 also acts as a molecular chaperone toward Rev (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). To determine the effect of CK2 phosphorylation of protein B23 on its Rev binding properties we performed experiments similar to the ones above using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated protein B23. Sedimentation analyses were performed with equimolar mixtures of Rev and protein B23 where Rev was labeled with 125I, and the concentrations of protein B23 were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a monoclonal antibody to protein B23. The experiments showed that protein B23 binds the Rev protein both at 4 °C and at 30 °C (Fig. 8,B and C), indicating that the complex can be formed without heating. Furthermore, phosphorylation of protein B23 was not capable of dissociating the complex formed at either temperature (Fig. 8, D and E). This observation suggests that protein B23 has an additional binding site for the Rev protein. One of them could be a general binding site for denatured proteins as above and the other could be a site that interacts more or less specifically with the Rev protein. To test this hypothesis, additional experiments were performed in which a synthetic peptide based on the NLS of the Rev protein (Rev37–47; ARRNRRRRWREYC) was used as a competitor. It was reported earlier that the Rev37–47 sequence is necessary for nucleolar localization of the Rev protein (27Cochrane A.W. Perkins A. Rosen C.A. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 881-885Google Scholar), and protein B23 binds the Rev37–47 NLS peptide with high affinity (15Szebeni A. Herrera J.E. Olson M.O.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8037-8042Google Scholar). In another series of experiments, equimolar amounts of the Rev protein were incubated at 4 and 30 °C with phosphorylated samples of protein B23 and nonphosphorylated controls. All of the incubation mixtures included a 10-fold molar excess of the Rev37–47 peptide. Fig. 6 F shows that the Rev37–47 peptide was able to prevent formation of the Rev-B23 complex at 4 °C. However, competition with the Rev peptide was not able to prevent formation of the complex at 30 °C (Fig.8 G). When phosphorylated protein B23 was incubated with Rev in the presence of the Rev37–47 peptide either at 4 or at 30 °C the two proteins sedimented as separate peaks (Fig. 8, H andI). This indicated that both phosphorylation of protein B23 and the presence of the competing peptide were required to dissociate the complex formed at 30 °C. To determine whether the competition was due to a specific sequence and not simply caused by the charge of the peptide, another peptide with a sequence that was the reverse of that of the Rev NLS peptide was used in a similar experiment. In this case, the reverse NLS peptide was not capable of dissociating the phosphorylated complex (Fig. 8 J), indicating that the interaction has a relatively high degree of specificity. Thus, complete dissociation of the Rev-B23 complex requires phosphorylation of protein B23 as well as competing peptide. This supports the idea that there are two sites of interaction between Rev and protein B23, with two different modes of binding. One mode is through a generic, nonpolar substrate-binding site whose affinity is controlled by phosphorylation, and the other operates via a negatively charged site that interacts with the basic Rev NLS. Protein B23 is a multifunctional protein that has many characteristics typically exhibited by molecular chaperones usingin vitro assays (5Szebeni A. Olson M.O. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 905-912Google Scholar). The current studies not only identify additional chaperone-like properties, but they also suggest that the protein B23-substrate interactions are regulated by a novel mechanism. First, protein B23 seems to detect the binding of a denatured substrate and respond by making sites for CK2 phosphorylation more accessible. Second, phosphorylation of B23 by CK2 promotes the dissociation of B23-substrate complexes. Finally, there seem to be two sites for binding at least one substrate, the HIV-1 Rev protein; that is, one site that recognizes nonpolar regions and another that interacts with basic segments of proteins. The former is regulated by phosphorylation, but what controls affinity for the latter has not been determined. A key feature of molecular chaperones is that they are able to detect bound substrates and regulate their release through allosteric interactions. For example, in Hsp70 (28Ha J.-H. Johnson E.R. McKay D.B. Sousa M.C. Takeda S. Willbanks S.M. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 573-608Google Scholar) and the Hsp100-Clp family (29Glover J.R. Schirmer E.C. Singer M.A. Lindquist S.L. Fink A.L. Goto Y. Molecular Chaperones in the Life Cycle of Proteins. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1998: 193-224Google Scholar), the binding of unfolded peptide increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis. In the case of the GroE molecular chaperones (3Leroux M.R. Hartl F.U. Pain R.H. Mechanisms of Protein Folding. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 364-405Google Scholar, 30Ranson N.A. Clarke A.R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 491-522Google Scholar), binding of a compact folding intermediate triggers a complex series of events including ATP binding, attachment of GroES, hydrolysis of the ATP, and eventual release of the substrate. With protein B23, the binding of substrate does not affect ATP hydrolysis directly, but it appears to enhance the accessibility of the CK2 phosphorylation sites of protein B23. The stimulation of CK2 phosphorylation by substrate binding has at least one other precedent in the nucleosome assembly factors NAP-1 and NAP-2; the addition of histones enhances CK2 phosphorylation of these proteins (31Rodriguez P. Pelletier J. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 225-238Google Scholar). In protein B23, the increased rate of phosphorylation is dependent on the presence of the nonpolar region in the N-terminal end, since the effect is not seen when that segment is deleted. Thus, the nonpolar region seems to communicate with the adjacent highly acidic segment, which contains the major CK2 phosphorylation site. As indicated above, in most molecular chaperones the release of substrate is coupled with ATP hydrolysis, which is directly carried out by ATPase activity in the chaperone itself. Although protein B23 is capable of binding ATP (32Chang J.H. Lin J.Y. Wu M.H. Yung B.Y.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 539-544Google Scholar), extensive studies in our laboratory have never detected any significant ATPase activity in the protein itself under any conditions. 2A. Szebeni and M. O. J. Olson, unpublished data. Thus, it is unlikely that the affinity of B23 for a substrate is regulated by direct nucleoside triphosphate hydrolysis. This observation prompted us to search for an alternative mechanism for dissociation of the complex. Because protein B23 is phosphorylated by CK2 (22Chan P.K. Aldrich M. Cook R.G. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1868-1872Google Scholar, 23Peter M. Nakagawa J. Doree M. Labbe J.C. Nigg E.A. Cell. 1990; 60: 791-801Google Scholar) and has been shown to be an interacting partner of the enzyme (33Grein S. Raymond K. Cochet C. Pyerin W. Chambaz E.M. Filhol O. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 105-109Google Scholar), it seemed reasonable to examine the possible effect of phosphorylation by this protein kinase on chaperone substrate binding. It was found that phosphorylation of protein B23 with CK2 before the addition of denatured substrate inhibits the formation of a stable complex. In the sedimentation assay, the interaction between CK2-phosphorylated B23 and the heat-denatured substrate protein was not detectable. This is a curious result since phosphorylated B23 maintained its ability to prevent thermal aggregation of the substrate and protect the enzyme from inactivation under elevated temperature conditions despite the undetectable interaction with the substrate. Because the chaperone properties would have to involve some kind of contact between phosphorylated B23 and the substrate, it is likely that the affinity between the two components is reduced but is sufficient to mediate the chaperone activity. However, because of the length of time required, the sedimentation assay is probably not capable of identifying low affinity interactions. Thus, in the phosphorylated protein, the chaperone activities may be mediated through transient interactions between protein B23 and the substrate; i.e. B23 might rapidly and repeatedly associate with and dissociate from the substrate, and this could be sufficient to sustain the chaperone activity. The more important observation is that phosphorylation of protein B23 in a pre-formed B23-substrate complex can promote the dissociation of the complex. This could be physiologically relevant since it was also shown that complex formation enhances the rate of phosphorylation. Thus, the bound form of protein B23 would tend to be preferentially targeted for phosphorylation compared with the unbound form; this could be the basis of a mechanism for regulating the cycle of binding and release. Although the proposed release mechanism seems applicable to many substrates, there are added considerations for the B23 interaction with the HIV-1 Rev protein. The Rev-B23 complex is not dissociable by CK2 phosphorylation alone. This complex seems to be held together by a combination of nonpolar and electrostatic interactions, and the latter set of interactions are not responsive to phosphorylation. Complete dissociation requires a combination of phosphorylation and competition with a peptide with the sequence of the Rev NLS. It is possible that specificity of the B23 chaperone resides in these electrostatic interactions. However, this raises the question of how the dissociation of these sites is achieved. Whether additional co-chaperones are required or whether competition by other proteins could displace the bound protein remain unanswered. How might this system operate in living organisms? Because of the abundance of protein B23 and the high concentration of proteins in the nucleolus, one could imagine that it would interact with a variety of nucleolar proteins, either ribosomal or nonribosomal proteins or both. To remove a partially unfolded protein from an aggregation pathway, protein B23 might recognize and bind to exposed surfaces on the protein (Fig. 9). The substrate protein would remain bound to B23 until it is phosphorylated by CK2. The latter enzyme is abundant in the nucleolus (34Issinger O.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Google Scholar) and migrates to the nucleolus under heat shock conditions (35Gerber D.A. Souquere-Besse S. Puvion F. Dubois M.F. Bensaude O. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23919-23926Google Scholar). Furthermore, CK2 is up-regulated during cell growth (36Ahmed K. Gerber D.A. Cochet C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Google Scholar), in which nucleolar activity and protein concentration are also elevated. The latter conditions would increase the probability for proteins to be partially unfolded and to be bound by protein B23. The binding event could allow time for the substrate protein to properly fold either while associated with protein B23 or after its release. CK2 might then preferentially phosphorylate protein B23-substrate complexes to promote their dissociation. Once the substrate is released, protein B23 could then be dephosphorylated by phosphoprotein phosphatases, which are also present in the nucleolus (4Andersen J.S. Lyon C.E. Fox A.H. Leung A.K. Lam Y.W. Steen H. Mann M. Lamond A.I. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1-11Google Scholar, 37Olson M.O.J. Guetzow K.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 526: 174-185Google Scholar). The latter event would restore the potential for B23 to bind a partially unfolded substrate. This cycle could be repeated over and over to facilitate the ribosome assembly process. Whether protein B23 is a general chaperone as suggested by the current studies using generic chaperone substrates or whether it recognizes specific substrates in the nucleolus is currently under investigation.

Ligand binding leads to activation of c-Kit, resulting in diverse cellular responses such as differentiation, proliferation, growth, survival, adhesion, and chemotaxis. These responses are the end result of the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways. Signal transduction molecules that bind to and become activated by c-Kit include Src family kinases (binding to Tyr568), Grb2 (binding to Tyr703 and Tyr936), SHP-2 (binding to Tyr568), SHP-1 (binding to Tyr570), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (binding to Tyr721) (6Linnekin D.

Alternative mRNA splicing results in the production of two isoforms of c-Kit in the mouse and four in humans. In both mouse and human, alternate splicing results in isoforms characterized by the presence or absence of a four-amino acid sequence, GNNK, in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain (Fig.1) (11Reith A.D. Ellis C. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Williams D.E. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2451-2459Google Scholar, 12Crosier P.S. Ricciardi S.T. Hall L.R. Vitas M.R. Clark S.C. Crosier K.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 1151-1158Google Scholar) This has been shown to be due to the use of alternative 5′ splice donor sites (13Hayashi S. Kunisada T. Ogawa M. Yamaguchi K. Nishikawa S.

The two splice forms, denoted GNNK− and GNNK+, respectively, are co-expressed in most tissues with the GNNK− form predominating (11Reith A.D. Ellis C. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Williams D.E. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2451-2459Google Scholar, 12Crosier P.S. Ricciardi S.T. Hall L.R. Vitas M.R. Clark S.C. Crosier K.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 1151-1158Google Scholar, 15Serve H.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar) demonstrated that NIH3T3 cells expressing either isoform differed in their transforming activity. In the presence of SCF, 1The abbreviations used are: SCF, stem cell factor; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline the GNNK− form induced anchorage-independent growth, loss of contact inhibition, and tumorigenicity. No difference in ligand binding affinity was observed between the two isoforms. It was demonstrated that upon ligand stimulation, the GNNK− isoform was more highly tyrosine-phosphorylated, more rapidly internalized, and activated ERK more strongly than the GNNK+ isoform. In this study, we have analyzed the molecular signaling mechanisms activated by the GNNK− and the GNNK+ isoforms. We have found that dramatic differences in activation of particular signal transduction pathways occur, whereas others remain identical between the two isoforms. The differences in signaling between the two isoforms were found to be to a large extent dependent on differential recruitment and activation of Src family kinases. Recombinant human SCF was a kind gift of AMGEN, Inc. The Src inhibitor SU6656 was a kind gift of SUGEN, Inc. The rabbit antiserum Kit-C1, recognizing the C-terminal tail of c-Kit, was purified as described (17Blume-Jensen P. Siegbahn A. Stabel S. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4199-4209Google Scholar). A rabbit antiserum recognizing ERK2, EET, was raised against the C-terminal sequence of ERK2 (EETARFQPGYRS) (18Leevers S.J. Marshall C.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 569-574Google Scholar). The Src antibody Ab-1 was from Oncogene Sciences. The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 and the Cbl antibody were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), and affinity-purified anti-Shc antibodies were purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories; phospho-ERK (Thr202/Tyr204) was from Cell Signaling Technology. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the c-Src SH2 domain was a kind gift from Dr. Tony Pawson. Phosphospecific antibodies against individual tyrosine phosphorylation sites in c-Kit were raised by immunizing rabbits with the following synthetic peptides conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by use of m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester: CEEINGNNpYVYIDPTQ (Tyr(P)568), CSDSTNEpYMDMKPGV (Tyr(P)721), CKNDSNpYVVKGA (Tyr(P)823), and STNHIpYSNLANCS (Tyr(P)936). The antibodies were extensively purified by chromatography over immobilized nonphosphorylated peptide, over phosphotyrosine-Sepharose, and finally over immobilized phosphopeptide. Purified antibodies were stored in 0.15 mNaCl, 20 m HEPES, pH 7.4, 50% glycerol at −70 °C. The specificity of each antibody was tested by Western blotting. COS7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with either wild-type c-Kit or the corresponding tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant of c-Kit in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml of recombinant human SCF for 10 min, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with c-Kit antibodies, followed by SDS gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer to an Immobilon P membrane. All of the preparations of antibodies used in this paper gave strong signals in wild-type receptors, whereas it gave no signal or a very weak signal in the corresponding tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing c-Kit have previously been described (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar). Pools of cells expressing equal levels of c-Kit were used throughout the study. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Immunoprecipitations and Western blotting were performed according to Ref. 17Blume-Jensen P. Siegbahn A. Stabel S. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4199-4209Google Scholar. Briefly, after stimulation of cells with 100 ng/ml SCF for the indicated period of time, the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1% Trasylol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm EDTA. The lysates were centrifuged at 14 000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, precleared for 30 min with 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose, and then incubated with the indicated antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads, washed three times in lysis buffer supplemented with 500 mm NaCl, and finally washed once with water. The samples were boiled for 3 min in reducing SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE in 7% continuous gels, after which proteins were quantitatively electrotransferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight in the cold with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS, or in the case of phosphospecific antibodies, in 1% dry milk powder, 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS. The filters were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS. Incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody was done for 1 h at room temperature, followed by extensive washing with 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS. The immunodetection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the Super Signal Dura reagent from Pierce. In vitro kinase assays of c-Src and c-Kit were performed as described (8Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Google Scholar). In brief, subconfluent cells were starved overnight in serum-free medium and stimulated with 100 ng/ml SCF at 37 °C for 5 min, followed by lysis and immunoprecipitation with Kit-C1 antibody or Src antibody Ab-1 (Oncogene Research), as outlined above. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP in 40 μl of kinase buffer (10 mm MnCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min at room temperature before separation by SDS gel electrophoresis and exposure to x-ray film. Acid denatured enolase was used as an exogenous substrate of Src (19Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y. Ulug E.T. Courtneidge S.A. Cell. 1990; 62: 481-492Google Scholar). Recombinant human SCF was labeled with 125I as described (17Blume-Jensen P. Siegbahn A. Stabel S. Heldin C.H. Rönnstrand L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4199-4209Google Scholar). Internalization experiments were performed essentially as described (20Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Google Scholar). In brief, confluent cells in 12-well plates were incubated with 50,000 cpm of125I-SCF/well for 60 min on ice. After washing twice with binding medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), the cells were incubated at 37 °C in binding medium for different time periods. The binding medium was removed and precipitated with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The amount of non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was taken as an estimate of ligand degradation. After removal of the medium, the cells were washed in binding medium and incubated for 5 min on ice with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin adjusted to pH 3.7 with acetic acid. This acid wash procedure releases more than 90% of cell surface-bound ligand into the buffer. After treatment with acidic buffer, the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100. Radioactivity was determined using a Packard γ-counter. The assay for incorporation of [3H]thymidine into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material was performed as described (21Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Google Scholar). NIH3T3 cells stably expressing either the GNNK− form or the GNNK+ form of human c-Kit were stimulated with 100 ng/ml recombinant human SCF for the indicated times at 37 °C, lysed in Triton X-100 lysis buffer, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using the Kit-C1 antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P. The filter was first probed with phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY-99), followed by stripping and reprobing with Kit-C1 antibody. It could be seen that the GNNK− form was strongly phosphorylated within minutes, followed by rapid degradation (Fig. 2). In contrast, the GNNK+ form showed a slow kinetics of rather weak autophosphorylation that persisted over a long period of time with no apparent receptor degradation. We have previously shown that Src is activated downstream of c-Kit, leading to phosphorylation of Shc, recruitment of Grb2-Sos, and activation of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (8Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether we could detect differences in Shc phosphorylation by the two splice forms. Surprisingly, Shc was phosphorylated more rapidly and with higher stoichiometry by the GNNK− form than by the GNNK+ form (Fig.3 A). Quantitation of data from CCD camera detection of chemiluminescence revealed an almost 3-fold higher magnitude of phosphorylation of Shc by the GNNK− form compared with the GNNK+ form (Fig. 3 B). Because we have previously shown that phosphorylation of Shc by c-Kit is dependent on Src kinase activity (8Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Google Scholar), we wanted to investigate whether Src was activated differentially by the two c-Kit isoforms. NIH3T3 cells expressing either the GNNK− or the GNNK+ form of c-Kit were stimulated with SCF and lysed. The lysates were incubated with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the SH2 domain of c-Src prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed extensively, and the bound material was separated on a SDS-PAGE, followed by electrotransfer to an Immobilon-P membrane. Probing of the membrane with Kit-C1 antibody revealed that the SCF-stimulated GNNK− isoform readily associated with the Src SH2 domain, whereas association of the GNNK+ form was very weak (Fig.4 A). To measure the kinase activity of Src, lysates from NIH3T3 cells expressing either the GNNK− or the GNNK+ form of c-Kit were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against c-Src and tested in an in vitro kinase assay using acid-denatured enolase as a substrate. As a control for specificity, the immunoprecipitates were incubated either with or without the Src kinase inhibitor SU6656. The GNNK− isoform could be demonstrated to induce a considerably stronger activation of c-Src than the GNNK+ isoform (Fig. 4 B). To verify that the kinase activity of c-Kit was unaffected by SU6656, immunoprecipitates of c-Kit from SCF-stimulated cells were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the presence or absence of SU6656 (Fig.4 C). As expected, the kinase activity of c-Kit, as judged by autophosphorylation, was unaffected by SU6656. The lower activity seen in the GNNK− form can be explained by the rapid ligand-induced degradation of c-Kit, compared with the GNNK+ isoform. The lower band seen corresponds to the immature form of c-Kit. When studying the signaling from the GNNK− and GNNK+ forms of c-Kit, Caruana et al. (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar) demonstrated a dramatic difference in ERK activation between the splice forms. Whereas the GNNK− form was strongly and rapidly activated, the GNNK+ induced a weak activation of ERKs. One possible explanation for this difference in ERK activation could be that different degrees of phosphorylation of Shc by Src might lead to differences in ERK activation. We showed that in NIH3T3 cells expressing the GNNK− form of c-Kit, the phosphorylation of ERK occurred much faster and reached a higher level than in cells expressing the GNNK+ form (Fig.5). Furthermore, activation of ERKs could largely be inhibited by the Src inhibitor SU6656, suggesting a role of Src family kinases in the activation of ERKs by c-Kit in these cells. The finding that c-Src associated more strongly with the GNNK− form than with the GNNK+ form, together with the finding that Shc, a substrate for c-Src, was phosphorylated to a higher degree by the GNNK− form than the GNNK+ form, prompted us to investigate the role of c-Src in the differential signaling seen by the two isoforms of c-Kit. Preincubation of NIH3T3 cells stably expressing the GNNK− form of c-Kit with the selective Src inhibitor SU6656 (22Blake R.A. Broome M.A. Liu X. Wu J. Gishizky M. Sun L. Courtneidge S.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9018-9027Google Scholar) caused slower kinetics of autophosphorylation of c-Kit, as well as a lower magnitude of autophosphorylation (Fig. 6). Furthermore, degradation of c-Kit in the presence of SU6656 was not as prominent as in the absence of inhibitor. When comparing the GNNK− form in the presence of Src inhibitor, the kinetics of phosphorylation and degradation resembled the pattern of the GNNK+ form, suggesting an involvement of differential activation of c-Src as a mechanism of splice-specific signaling. To assess whether the decrease in c-Kit expression following ligand stimulation of NIH3T3 cells expressing either the GNNK− form or the GNNK+ form was due to differences in internalization, the cells were incubated with 125I-SCF on ice for 1 h. The cells were washed extensively and transferred to 37 °C and incubated for the indicated period of time. The cell surface bound radioactivity was removed by washing with an acidic buffer. Ligand-induced internalization was only slightly faster in the GNNK− form compared with GNNK+ form (data not shown), and by use of the SU6656 Src kinase inhibitor, it could be shown to be partially dependent on the activity of Src family kinases. The cell lysates from the experiment described above were treated with 10% trichloroacetic acid to precipitate protein bound radioactivity. After centrifugation, the supernatant was counted in a γ-counter, as a measure of degradation. It could clearly be seen that degradation of 125I-SCF bound to the GNNK+ form (Fig. 7) occurred very slowly and was slightly dependent on the activity of Src family kinases. In contrast, degradation of 125I-SCF bound to the GNNK− form was very rapid, and degradation was inhibited to about 50% by the Src inhibitor SU6656. The multifunctional adapter protein Cbl has been shown to be involved in regulation of polyubiquitination of proteins, which has been demonstrated to tag proteins for degradation in either the lysosomes or in the proteasome complex. Joazeiro and colleagues (23Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Google Scholar) demonstrated that Cbl possesses a ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. Src has been demonstrated to phosphorylate and positively regulate the ubiquitin ligase activity of Cbl (24Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Google Scholar). Given the dramatic differences in degradation of the GNNK− and GNNK+ isoform following SCF stimulation, we wanted to test whether differences in Src-mediated phosphorylation of Cbl could account for the differences in degradation. NIH3T3 cells expressing either isoform were stimulated with SCF in the presence or absence of SU6656, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody against Cbl. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, electrotransferred to an Immobilon-P filter, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies followed by reprobing with Cbl antibodies. It could be shown that phosphorylation of Cbl was considerably stronger in cells expressing the GNNK− compared with cells expressing the GNNK+ isoform and that the phosphorylation was inhibited by the Src inhibitor SU6656 (Fig.8). It has previously been shown that the GNNK− form is better than the GNNK+ form in inducing anchorage-independent growth as well as focus formation of NIH3T3 cells (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar). Furthermore, several of the above mentioned signal transduction pathways have been linked to transformation, such as the Src family kinases and the Ras/ERK pathway. Therefore, we compared the ability of the GNNK− and the GNNK+ forms to mediate an SCF-dependent mitogenic response. NIH3T3 cells expressing either isoform of c-Kit were starved for 24 h, followed by stimulation with SCF for 48 h in the presence of [3H]thymidine. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was counted in a scintillation counter. A difference in mitogenic response to SCF was observed, where the GNNK− form was better than the GNNK+ form (Fig. 9). This is consistent with the observations that the Src family kinases and the Ras/ERK pathway are more efficiently activated by the GNNK− form. To be able to study the phosphorylation of individual tyrosine residues in c-Kit, a panel of phosphospecific antibodies were produced recognizing phosphorylated Tyr568(c-Src association site), Tyr721 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase association site), Tyr823 (activation loop), and Tyr936 (association site for Grb2 and Grb7). To verify the specificity of the individual phosphospecific antibodies, COS7 cells were transfected with either wild-type c-Kit (GNNK+) or the corresponding tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation, stimulated with SCF for 10 min at 37 °C, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with a c-Kit antibody. After electrophoresis and transfer to Immobilon P membranes, the filters were probed with either phosphospecific antibody. In all cases, wild-type c-Kit gave a strong signal, whereas the corresponding tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutant gave a weak signal or no signal (Fig.10 A). To verify that the tyrosine kinase activity of the mutant receptors was not impaired, the filters were stripped and reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (Fig. 10 B). NIH3T3 cells expressing either the GNNK− form or the GNNK+ form were stimulated with 100 ng/ml SCF for the indicated time periods, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the Kit-C1 antibody. Immunoprecipitated receptor was separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P membrane. The filter was then probed with either phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY99), Tyr(P)568, Tyr(P)721, Tyr(P)823, or Tyr(P)936antibodies, respectively (Fig. 11). As previously demonstrated, ligand stimulation of the GNNK− form led to rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of c-Kit, whereas the GNNK+ showed a slower kinetics, weaker phosphorylation, but persistent signaling (Fig. 11). When probing an identical filter with the Tyr(P)568 antibody, rapid and transient phosphorylation was seen in the GNNK− at the 2-min time point but then rapidly declined. In contrast, the GNNK+ form showed a constant low level of phosphorylation, even in the absence of SCF stimulation. The Tyr(P)823 antibody against the activation loop tyrosine thought to be of importance for activation of c-Kit kinase activity followed the same kinetics as the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Kit; in the GNNK− form there was a rapid and strong increase in phosphorylation, whereas in the GNNK+ form only a very weak signal was detected. Probing with the Tyr(P)721 antibody, which detects phosphorylation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase association site in c-Kit, revealed a rapid and strong phosphorylation in the GNNK− form, whereas in the GNNK+ the phosphorylation was slow, but persisted for a longer time, and was of the same magnitude as for the GNNK− form. This is in agreement with previous observations by Caruanaet al. (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar), demonstrating a similar magnitude in association of phosphoinositide 3-kinase to c-Kit as well as activation of Akt by the two splice forms. Phosphorylation of Tyr936, constituting a docking site for both Grb2 and Grb7, showed strong and rapid kinetics in the GNNK− form, whereas it was even stronger and more persistent in the GNNK+ form (Fig. 11). In summary, phosphorylation of individual sites did not follow the same kinetics as the overall phosphorylation, which could explain why different signal transduction pathways are affected to different extent by the two splice forms. Several splice forms of human c-Kit have been described to date (11Reith A.D. Ellis C. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Williams D.E. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2451-2459Google Scholar, 12Crosier P.S. Ricciardi S.T. Hall L.R. Vitas M.R. Clark S.C. Crosier K.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 1151-1158Google Scholar), but the physiological significance of these different forms is unknown. Two of the existing splice forms differ in the presence or absence of a four-amino acid stretch, GNNK. To investigate the function of these isoforms, we have used NIH3T3 fibroblasts, which lack endogenous c-Kit, transfected with either splice form of c-Kit (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar). It was previously shown that NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing the GNNK− form exhibited SCF-dependent anchorage independent growth and loss of contact inhibition and were tumorigenic in nude mice (16Caruana G. Cambareri A.C. Ashman L.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5573-5581Google Scholar). In contrast, NIH3T3 cells expressing the GNNK+ exhibited anchorage-independent growth but relatively poor focus formation and did not form tumors in nude mice. Despite similar affinity for SCF, the GNNK− form displayed more rapid and extensive tyrosine autophosphorylation and faster internalization. In this paper, we have studied the molecular mechanisms behind the differences in signal transduction from the two splice forms. We could show that the kinetics of phosphorylation of c-Kit was much faster and stronger in the GNNK− form, compared with the GNNK+ form (Fig. 2). This was followed by a rapid degradation of the GNNK− form, whereas expression of the GNNK+ form remained stable. Yee et al.(25Yee N.S. Hsiau C.W. Serve H. Vosseller K. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31991-31998Google Scholar) showed that in murine mast cells, ligand binding to c-Kit leads to rapid internalization and ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Inactivation of the receptor kinase resulted in reduced rate of internalization of ligand-receptor complexes, and no ubiquitination took place. However, Gommerman et al. (26Gommerman J.L. Rottapel R. Berger S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30519-30525Google Scholar) found, when studying the murine lymphoma cell line DA-1 transfected with c-Kit, a dependence of an intact Tyr721 site for internalization of ligand bound c-Kit. A partial role for Src family kinases in ligand-driven internalization of c-Kit was demonstrated by Broudy et al.(27Broudy V.C. Lin N.L. Liles W.C. Corey S.J. O'Laughlin B. Mou S. Linnekin D. Blood. 1999; 94: 1979-1986Google Scholar) using the inhibitor PP1. In our hands, inhibition of Src family kinases caused a partial inhibition of c-Kit internalization, but a dramatic effect was seen on ligand degradation (Fig. 8). A role for c-Src in receptor degradation has been seen for platelet-derived growth factor α-receptor (28Rosenkranz S. Ikuno Y. Leong F.L. Klinghoffer R.A. Miyake S. Band H. Kazlauskas A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9620-9627Google Scholar). It was shown that receptor-mediated phosphorylation of c-Cbl and polyubiquitination of the receptor required the association site for Src family kinases on the receptor. In other words, ligand-induced activation of Src family kinase activity was a prerequisite for c-Cbl phosphorylation and ubiquitination. It has recently been demonstrated that c-Cbl is a ubiquitin E3 ligase (23Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Google Scholar). We and others have previously shown (8Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Google Scholar, 29Bondzi C. Litz J. Dent P. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 305-314Google Scholar) that the main pathway of c-Kit activation of the Ras/ERK pathway goes through Src-dependent phosphorylation of Shc. The Y568F/Y570F mutant of c-Kit, which fails to activate Src family kinases, mediates only a very weak activation of ERK. The two autophosphorylation sites, Tyr703 and Tyr936, that have been shown to bind to Grb2 in vitro (10Thömmes K. Lennartsson J. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Biochem.

Rollman, and L. Rönnstrand, unpublished observation. Furthermore, the low degree of direct association of Grb2 to c-Kit is lost if Tyr703 is mutated to phenylalanine,2 suggesting that Tyr936 plays a minor role in binding of Grb2 in thein vivo situation. In this paper, we show that c-Kit-mediated activation of ERK is stronger in the GNNK− form compared with the GNNK+ form, correlating with an increased degree of activation of Src family kinases by the GNNK− form compared with the GNNK+ form. Furthermore, activation of ERK by the two isoforms of c-Kit is inhibited by the Src inhibitor SU6656 (Fig. 5). Thus, it is likely that the differences in activation of the Ras/ERK pathway can be accounted for by the differential regulation of Src family kinases by the two splice forms. The role of ERK activation in the mitogenic response to c-Kit stimulation is unclear. We have previously shown (8Lennartsson J. Blume-Jensen P. Hermanson M. Pontén E. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5546-5553Google Scholar) that when the two tyrosine residues responsible for activation of Src family kinases, Tyr568 and Tyr570 in c-Kit, are mutated and the level of ERK activation is very low, we still get a reasonable mitogenic response. Other studies have also shown that, under certain circumstances, c-Kit-mediated mitogenesis can be independent of ERK activation (29Bondzi C. Litz J. Dent P. Krystal G.W. Cell Growth Differ. 2000; 11: 305-314Google Scholar). The rapid and strong autophosphorylation of c-Kit seen in the GNNK− form could be due to c-Src-mediated phosphorylation of c-Kit at Tyr823 in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain. Our data show that phosphorylation of Tyr823parallels that of total receptor autophosphorylation. Tyr823 in the activation loop is conserved in most tyrosine kinases and in many cases found to be of importance for regulation of its activity in, for example, the insulin receptor and the fibroblast growth factor receptor (30Ellis L. Clauser E. Morgan D.O. Edery M. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Cell. 1986; 45: 721-732Google Scholar, 31Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Google Scholar). However, cells expressing the Y823F mutant of c-Kit still show a level of kinase activity similar to wild-type receptors.2 Using cells overexpressing either kinase active or inactive c-Src, Biscardi et al. (32Biscardi J.S. Maa M.C. Tice D.A. Cox M.E. Leu T.H. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8335-8343Google Scholar) showed that c-Src mediates phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor at Tyr845 and Tyr1101. Tyr845 is located in a position analogous to Tyr823 in c-Kit, and phosphorylation of this site by c-Src was found to contribute positively to epidermal growth factor-mediated mitogenicity. It is striking that a stretch of only four amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain could make such a dramatic difference in the signaling characteristics of a receptor. However, recent data suggest that not only ligand-induced dimerization is required for full activation of receptor tyrosine kinases but also the steric orientation of the two receptor subunits (for review, see Ref. 33Jiang G. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R568-R571Google Scholar). It has been shown that full activation of the erythropoietin receptor requires not only dimerization of receptors but also the correct orientation of the receptor subunit (34Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Google Scholar). Recently, Leibigeret al. (35Leibiger B. Leibiger I.B. Moede T. Kemper S. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Moitoso de Vargas L. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 559-570Google Scholar) described differences in the signal transduction pathways activated and the repertoire of gene expression induced upon stimulation of the two splice forms of the insulin receptor, INSR-A and INSR-B. The INSR-A isoform was shown to induce expression of the insulin gene, whereas the INSR-B isoform mediated induction of glucokinase. Through differential use of exon11, the two splice forms of the insulin receptor differ in only 12 twelve amino acids in the C terminus of the α-subunit. Furthermore, Bell et al. (36Bell C.A. Tynan J.A. Hart K.C. Meyer A.N. Robertson S.C. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3589-3599Google Scholar) made a series of platelet-derived growth factor β-receptor mutants in which they put a dimerization motif derived from the sequence of oncogenic Neu at different positions in the transmembrane region. This led to the creation of a series of constitutive receptor dimers in which the intracellular parts were gradually rotated 103° for each mutant. Interestingly, rotational linkage of the transmembrane domain with the kinase domain was evidenced by a periodic activation of the receptor because the dimerization motif was shifted across the transmembrane domain. It might very well be that the four-amino acid insert, which is located in a predicted α-helical region, leads to a less favorable positioning of the intracellular parts of the receptor in a dimer than if those amino acids are absent. Interestingly, a similar pair of splice variants affecting the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain have been described for the ErbB2 receptor (37Kwong K.Y. Hung M.C. Mol Carcinog. 1998; 23: 62-68Google Scholar). A novel transcript of ErbB2 was found in human carcinomas, involving a deletion of 16 amino acids in the juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain. It was shown that this splice form showed much stronger tyrosine kinase activity than the normal splice form, and it was also much stronger in its transforming ability, as judged by focus formation assay. Finally, Moriki et al. (38Moriki T. Maruyama H. Maruyama I.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1011-1026Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of correct orientation of the epidermal growth factor receptors in a dimer for full kinase activity. Future studies are aimed at understanding the precise mechanism by which these two splice forms can activate Src family kinases and other signal transduction pathways differently. By using cDNA microarray technology, we will be able to dissect in greater detail the differences and similarities in gene induction/repression by the different splice forms of c-Kit and attempt to link these observations to differences in biological responses induced by the two receptor forms.

Mutations within the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome (MFS), a heritable disease of connective tissue. More than 607 of MFS-causing mutations identified are localized to cbEGFs, emphasizing that the native properties of these domains are critical for fibrillin-1 function. The cbEGF12–13 domain pair is within the longest run of cbEGFs, and many mutations that cluster in this region are associated with severe, neonatal MFS. The NMR solution structure of Ca2+-loaded cbEGF12–13 exhibits a near-linear, rod-like arrangement of domains. This observation supports the hypothesis that all fibrillin-1 (cb)EGF-cbEGF pairs, characterized by a single interdomain linker residue, possess this rod-like structure. The domain arrangement of cbEGF12–13 is stabilized by additional interdomain packing interactions to those observed for cbEGF32–33, which may help to explain the previously reported higher calcium binding affinity of cbEGF13. Based on this structure, a model of cbEGF11–15 that encompasses all known neonatal MFS missense mutations has highlighted a potential binding region. Backbone dynamics data confirm the extended structure of cbEGF12–13 and lend support to the hypothesis that a correlation exists between backbone flexibility and cbEGF domain calcium affinity.

Fibrillin-1, a major component of 10–12-nm connective tissue microfibrils (12Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Google Scholar), is mainly comprised of multiple, tandem repeats of cbEGF domains (Fig. 1b). Over 300 mutations within the fibrillin-1 (FBN1) have been reported that are associated with MFS and related disorders (6Collod-Beroud G. Beroud C. Ades L. Black C. Boxer M. Brocks D.J.H.

MFS is an inherited disorder estimated to affect ∼1/5,000 in the population (reviewed in Ref. 14Dietz H.C. Pyeritz R.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 1799-1809Google Scholar); symptoms vary from mild to life-threatening, and although the genotype-phenotype relationship remains elusive, a cluster of mutations in the region corresponding to exons 24–32 (encoding transforming growth factor ॆ-binding protein-like domain-3 and cbEGF domains 11–18) have been found to be associated with the most severe forms of the disease, including neonatal MFS (nMFS). Mutations that produce a more moderate phenotype are, however, also found in this region (6Collod-Beroud G. Beroud C. Ades L. Black C. Boxer M. Brocks D.J.H. Holman K.J. de Paepe A. Francke U.

Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 323-326Google Scholar, 18Cardy C.M. Handford P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 855-860Google Scholar, 19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). In addition, the spatial localization of MFS causing missense mutations within this region has been identified, and structural consequences have been considered. An extended region of fibrillin-1 (cbEGF11–15) has been modeled to gain further insight into the molecular basis of the severe, neonatal MFS phenotype.NMR backbone relaxation measurements were performed to highlight regions of the cbEGF12–13 pair with increased flexibility, which may indicate their involvement in protein-protein interactions. The data for cbEGF12–13 were compared with previous backbone dynamics measurements for the cbEGF32–33 domain pair (20Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Google Scholar). This analysis has provided information regarding variations in intrinsic dynamics of cbEGF domains along the length of human fibrillin-1, which are relevant to the biomechanical properties of connective tissue microfibrils and the phenotypic variability of MFS-associated mutations.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe cbEGF12–13 domain pair from human fibrillin-1 includes residues Asp1070-Ile1154 of the intact molecule (numbering according to Ref. 21Pereira L. D'Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol.

Handford P.A. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 957-959Google Scholar). 15N isotopically enriched samples were produced analogously using Escherichia coli strain BL21[pREP4], which was grown in minimal media with15NH4Cl as the sole nitrogen source. Low resolution electrospray mass spectrometry was used to confirm the molecular weight of the produced protein (data not shown).NMR samples contained 20 mm CaCl2 and 4.55 mm Tris at pH 6.5. At 20 mmCaCl2, in the absence of additional salt, saturation of both calcium binding sites of the pair was established based on chemical shift comparison with previous calcium binding studies (23Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Google Scholar). Furthermore, 2D HSQC spectra (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar) recorded on a 15N-labeled sample containing 10, 12, 14, 17, and 20 mmCaCl2 indicated that saturation was achieved with 20 mm CaCl2. Samples for homonuclear NMR experiments contained ∼3 or 3.6 mm cbEGF12–13 in 907 H2O/107 2H2O or 99.99672H2O, respectively. A 15N-labeled sample used to obtain both 3D data and heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation-J (scalar coupling constant) data for use in structure calculations contained 3.8 mm cbEGF12–13 in 907 H2O/107 2H2O. Samples for acquiring NH-exchange data contained ∼1.6 mm15N-labeled cbEGF12–13 in 99.99672H2O for 2H2O exchange experiments and ∼1 mm15N-labeled cbEGF12–13 in 907 H2O/107 2H2O for H2O exchange experiments.The sample used to obtain NMR data for 15N backbone dynamics analysis contained ∼1 mm15N-labeled cbEGF12–13 in 4.55 mm Tris, 20 mmCaCl2 at pH 6.5. To ensure data were not affected by sample aggregation, measurements were also performed on a 1.6 mmcbEGF12–13 sample. The concentrations of samples were estimated fromA280 measurements using ε280 = 3280 m−1 cm−1.NMR ExperimentsInitial assignments were made using 3D gradient-enhanced 15N-separated NOESY-HSQC spectra (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar,25Kay L.E. Marion D. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 83: 72-84Google Scholar), recorded at 15 and 33 °C on a home-built/GE Omega spectrometer operating at 600 MHz. The spectrometer was fitted with a triple resonance probe with self-shielded pulsed field gradients. 3D NOESY spectra were recorded over ∼3 days, with acquisition times of 102 ms in the direct 1H (F3) dimension, 10 ms in the15N (F2) dimension, and within a range of 21.2 to 25.6 ms in the indirect 1H (F1) dimension. All NOESY spectra were recorded with a mixing time of 150 ms, and linear prediction was used to double the F2 acquisition time to 20 ms (26Zhu G. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 405-410Google Scholar). Gradient-enhanced 15N-separated total correlation spectroscopy-HSQC spectra (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar) were recorded on the same spectrometer at 15 and 33 °C to enable identification of intraresidue cross-peaks. These spectra were recorded over approximately 3 days with the same acquisition times as for the NOESY, except for 16 ms in the indirect 1H (F1) dimension. Magnetization transfer was effected using an 11-kHz DIPSI-2 mixing sequence for 46 ms.Assignments were confirmed by comparison using homonuclear 2D NOESY (τm = 150 ms) (27Jeener J. Meier B.H.

Magn. Reson. 1990; 86: 110-126Google Scholar) was recorded at 33 °C and 500 MHz to allow derivation of3JHN-Hα coupling constants. This spectrum was recorded with an acquisition time of 82 ms in the direct1H (F2) dimension and 261 ms in the15N (F1) dimension.NH-exchange data in 2H2O were obtained by recording a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra (24Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar) at 33 °C after a fully protonated cbEGF12–13 sample had been dissolved in a 2H2O solution (34Barsukov I.L. Lian L.-Y. Roberts G.C.K. NMR of Macromolecules. Oxford University Press, Inc., New York1993: 315-357Google Scholar). NH-exchange data in H2O at 33 °C were obtained using the method of Böckmann & Guittet (35Böckmann A. Guittet E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 127-130Google Scholar), using a 100-ms timescale for NH-exchange.Relaxation data were acquired at 35 °C and pH 6.5 allowing direct comparisons with results obtained for the cbEGF32–33 pair from human fibrillin-1 (19Downing A.K.

Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Google Scholar). In T1 and T2experiments, acquisition times were 102.4 and 110.5 ms in the1H (F2) and the 15N (F1) dimensions, respectively. Relaxation delays used to collect T1 data were 20.0, 40.1 (measured twice), 80.2, 120.3, 180.4, 260.6, 360.8, 481.0, 701.5, and 1002.1 ms at 11.7 T and 20.0, 40.1 (measured twice), 60.1, 120.2, 200.4, 300.6, 501.0, 701.4, 1001.9, and 1502.9 ms at 17.6 T. Delays used to collect T2data were 6, 12 (measured twice), 18, 36, 48, 66, 90, 120, 150, 210, and 300 ms at both 11.7 and 17.6 T.Acquisition times for the 1H-detected1H-15N heteronuclear NOE experiments were 102.4 and 81.9 ms in F2 (1H) and 110.4 and 79.7 ms in F1 (15N), at 11.7 and 17.6 T, respectively. In experiments with NOE, 1H saturation was effected by means of a train of 120° flip-angle pulses at 10-ms intervals for 3 and 4.5 s at 11.7 and 17.6 T, respectively.All spectra were processed using Felix 2.3 (MSI, Inc.) with mild resolution enhancement in both dimensions to optimize resolution while maintaining a good signal-to-noise ratio. Where applicable, all spectra recorded in one series were processed identically.Spectral AssignmentSequence-specific 1H and15N chemical shift assignments were made using conventional methods (36Cavanagh J.

Backbone φ torsion angles were restrained with a minimum range of ±30° for 26 residues having small 3JHN-Hα coupling constants (<5.0 Hz) or large 3JHN-Hα values (>8.0 Hz). φ angle restraints were only included in the structure calculation process where consistent with initial structures calculated in their absence.NH-exchange data in 2H2O and H2O were used to identify slowly exchanging backbone amide protons, and those that could be assigned to regions of regular secondary structure were restrained to form HN-CO hydrogen bonds, using two distance restraints, dO-N = 3.3 Å anddO-HN = 2.3 Å. In final structures, 24 experimentally derived distance restraints were used for 12 backbone hydrogen bonds in ॆ-sheet structures. These restraints were incorporated into structure calculations only where consistent with both NOE data and initial structures calculated in their absence. Calcium atoms were constrained as described previously (19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar).Structure Calculation and RefinementStructures were calculated using ab intio simulated annealing from an extended template in XPLOR, version 3.81 (39Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) with version 4.01 topology and version 4.02 parameter files according to methods described previously (19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). A final group of 25 was selected from 100 structures based on agreement with experimental data, with no distance violations greater than 0.3 Å, no φ angle violations (i.e. final values for restrained φ angles remained within the ± 30° limits), and FNOE less than 102 kJ mol−1. An average coordinate structure was calculated and energy-minimized based on all residues (39Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Manual: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar), and the consensus secondary structure was derived using the program PROCHECK_NMR (40Laskowski R.A. Rullmann J.A.C. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Google Scholar). A summary of the NMR structural statistics for the cbEGF12–13 domain pair, in terms of agreement with experimental data, is given in the PDB entry for the pair 1LMJ.Analysis of Relaxation DataT1 and T2 relaxation time constants were derived from two-parameter exponential fits to resonance intensities for all non-overlapped peaks. Errors were determined from the standard deviations of differences in the peak intensities in the two spectra that were recorded with the same relaxation delay (41Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Google Scholar). The heteronuclear NOE effect was calculated as the ratio of resonance intensities in spectra recorded with and without NOE. Errors were estimated from the signal-to-noise ratio of each spectrum.A robust estimate of the diffusion tensor was obtained by selecting residues with NOE > 0.65 and with T1 and T2 values within a Lipari-Szabo diffusion model ofS2 < 1.0 using the average minimized structure. These residues did not exhibit significant line broadening at either field strength (41Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Google Scholar, 42Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Google Scholar, 43Boyd J. Redfield C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9692-9693Google Scholar). Removal of a number of residues on statistical grounds had only minor effects on the diffusion tensor and led to a self-consistent interpretation of the data. Errors were estimated using 500 Monte Carlo simulations. The spectral densities were derived for a sphere (Dxx =Dyy = Dzz;D = (Dxx +Dyy + Dzz)/3), a symmetric top (D∥︀ = Dzzand D⊥ = ½(Dxx+Dyy), and a fully asymmetric tensor with principal values Dxx,Dyy, and Dzz (44Woessner D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 37: 647-654Google Scholar) using dipolar and chemical shift anisotropy relaxation with the usual fundamental constants, a chemical shift anisotropy of −170 ppm (45Tjandra N. Szabo A. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 6986-6991Google Scholar), and an NH bond length of 1.02 Å. The angles θ, φ, and ϕ denote the orientation of the tensors with respect to the inertia frame. Inclusion of an angle of 0 to +40° between the dipolar and chemical shift anisotropy tensor (43Boyd J. Redfield C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9692-9693Google Scholar) had no statistically significant effect on the results.Internal dynamics were analyzed using the extended model-free approach (46Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 104: 4546-4559Google Scholar, 47Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1989; 104: 4559-4570Google Scholar, 48Clore G.M. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscoll P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Google Scholar) as implemented in Model-free4 (41Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Google Scholar, 42Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Google Scholar). The procedures used have been described previously (49Werner J.M. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 173: 285-300Google Scholar). In addition line broadening was confirmed based on the field dependence of the line width at 11.7versus 17.6 T (50Phan I.Q.H. Boyd J. Campbell I.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 369-378Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONComparison of the structures of cbEGF12–13 and cbEGF32–33 from fibrillin-1 validates the proposal that fibrillin-1 (cb)EGF-cbEGF domain pairs, with one residue in their interdomain linker, adopt a rigid, rod-like structure when saturated with Ca2+ (19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar). It is also interesting to compare the structure of the low density lipoprotein receptor EGF-AB pair, another Class I cbEGF domain pair (55Kurniawan N.D. Aliabadizadeh K. Brereton I.M. Kroon P.A. Smith R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 341-356Google Scholar, 56Saha S. Boyd J. Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. Structure. 2001; 9: 451-456Google Scholar). Tilt and twist angles were measured for this construct using identical methods to be 27 ± 6 and 168 ± 5° (56Saha S. Boyd J. Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. Structure. 2001; 9: 451-456Google Scholar), compared with 30 ± 15 and 152 ± 13°, and 18 ± 6 and 159 ± 6° for fibrillin-1 cbEGF12–13 and cbEGF32–33, respectively. All three of these domain pairs adopt a very similar cbEGF orientation, which lends further support to the hypothesis that the Class I consensus sequence defines a conserved domain architecture (19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar).Analysis of backbone relaxation data for holo-cbEGF32–33 suggested a correlation between backbone flexibility and calcium binding affinity. This is supported by the relaxation data for cbEGF12–13. For both tandem cbEGF domain pairs, the N-terminal domain binds calcium more weakly than the C-terminal domain, and residues in the N-terminal half of the first domain are affected by ॖs to ms timescale motions. Comparison of dynamics for the N-terminal halves of cbEGF12 and cbEGF32 show that residues from this region of cbEGF12 have largerS2 values and smaller Rexterms than the corresponding residues of cbEGF32. The affinities of the N- and C-terminal domains of cbEGF12–13 for Ca2+ are significantly higher than those observed for cbEGF32–33, which correlates with the increased anisotropy of the diffusion tensor for cbEGF12–13 (1.9 versus 1.6). The less than expected anisotropy of the diffusion tensor of cbEGF32–33 was primarily attributed to significant fluctuations in the N-terminal cbEGF32 domain (19Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Google Scholar, 20Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Google Scholar). The reduced internal dynamics in cbEGF12, together with the increased anisotropy of cbEGF12–13, indicates that the N-terminal half of cbEGF12 in cbEGF12–13 has a better defined structure than cbEGF32 in cbEGF32–33.The fact that several residues of the major ॆ-sheet of cbEGF12 have significant Rex terms, an effect not seen for cbEGF13, suggests that the lower calcium binding affinity observed for this domain relative to cbEGF13 (∼1.6 mmversus < 30 ॖm) may be a result of slow dynamic processes that compromise the formation of a well defined binding site (23Smallridge R.S. Whiteman P. Doering K. Handford P.A. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 661-668Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that cbEGF32 in cbEGF32–33, which has a calcium binding affinity more than five times weaker than cbEGF12 (∼9 mm) (51Knott V. Downing A.K. Cardy C.M. Handford P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 22-27Google Scholar), has Rex terms with an upper limit of 30 Hz (20Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Google Scholar) compared with an upper limit of 10 Hz for cbEGF12. The lack of significant exchange contributions, where data were available, for residues in the minor ॆ-sheet of cbEGF12 and the major ॆ-sheet of cbEGF13 suggest that cbEGF13 is able to form a well defined calcium binding site, explaining the relatively high calcium binding affinity observed for this domain. Model-free analysis was performed for cbEGF12–13 Ca2+ ligands Glu1073, Asn1088, Thr1089, Asp1113, Ile1114, Glu1116, and Asn1131, and none of these residues require an exchange term >1 Hz apart from Asn1088 (2.5 Hz). These observations are consistent with calcium saturation. Saturation was similarly established for cbEGF32–33 (20Werner J.M. Knott V. Handford P.A. Campbell I.D. Downing A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1065-1078Google Scholar).An extended loop structure in cbEGF12 between cysteines 5 and 6 was observed to be highly solvent accessible and relatively unstructured, with reduced 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE values indicative of increased flexibility. Because protein binding interactions usually involve at least one flexible component, this region may be important for intra- or intermolecular contacts. It could be directly involved in microfibril assembly, i.e. directly interacting with itself or other fibrillin-1 monomers, or it may be involved in the interaction of non-homologous proteins/proteoglycans with the 10–12-nm microfibrils. The cbEGF6 domain from thrombomodulin is the only other cbEGF of known structure with a large 13-residue loop connecting cysteines 5 and 6, and a residue in this region (Asp461) has been shown to be involved in complex formation with thrombin, suggesting a potential role for the fibrillin loop in protein-protein interactions (57Fuentes-Prior P. Iwanaga Y. Huber R. Pagila R. Rumennik G. Seto M. Morser J. Light D.R. Bode W. Nature. 2000; 404: 518-525Google Scholar). Similarly, the cbEGF domain from C1r has an unusually large loop region connecting cysteines 1 and 2. This region does not possess a unique structure and has therefore been proposed to play a role in domain-d"

Overexpression of topoisomerase III at the nonpermissive temperature was shown subsequently to restore timely chromosome decatenation and suppress lethality in strains carrying either temperature-sensitive parE or parCalleles. By developing an assay in vitro for precatenane unlinking, we demonstrated directly that both topoisomerase III and topoisomerase IV were efficient at this task, whereas DNA gyrase was very inefficient at precatenane removal. These observations suggest that precatenane unlinking is sufficient to sustain decatenation of replicating daughter chromosomes in the cell. topB, encoding topoisomerase III, was identified as a high copy suppressor of the temperature-sensitiveparC1215 allele, encoding one of the subunits of topoisomerase IV. Overexpression of topoisomerase III at the nonpermissive temperature was shown subsequently to restore timely chromosome decatenation and suppress lethality in strains carrying either temperature-sensitive parE or parCalleles. By developing an assay in vitro for precatenane unlinking, we demonstrated directly that both topoisomerase III and topoisomerase IV were efficient at this task, whereas DNA gyrase was very inefficient at precatenane removal. These observations suggest that precatenane unlinking is sufficient to sustain decatenation of replicating daughter chromosomes in the cell. topoisomerase isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside open reading frame late replication intermediates Escherichia coli has four DNA topoisomerases, two type IIA DNA gyrase and topoisomerase (Topo)1 IV, and two type IA Topo I and Topo III. The roles in the cell played by three of these proteins is reasonably well defined (1Levine C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 29-43Google Scholar, 2Postow L. Peter B.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 805-808Google Scholar, 3Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Google Scholar, 4Wang J.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 430-440Google Scholar). DNA gyrase is the major facilitator of DNA replication, acting to convert the positive supercoils generated directly to negative ones. Mutations in eithergyrA or gyrB, encoding the subunits of gyrase, are conditionally lethal, and incubation of such mutated strains at the non-permissive temperature causes a rapid cessation of DNA replication. Topo IV is the cellular decatenase, responsible for unlinking the daughter chromosomes so that chromosome segregation is accomplished in a timely manner. Mutations in either parE orparC, encoding the subunits of Topo IV, are also conditionally lethal. Incubation of either parE orparC temperature-sensitive strains at the non-permissive temperature results in the elaboration of a par phenotype, where a large DNA mass accumulates in the center of an elongated cell. This DNA mass results from repeated initiations of replication on chromosomes that have not segregated. Topo IV appears also to be able to support replication fork progression at about one-half the rate supported by gyrase (5Khodursky A.B. Peter B.J. Schmid M.B. DeRisi J. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Cozzarelli N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9419-9424Google Scholar). Topo I acts as a balancing force to gyrase, such that the net negative superhelicity of the chromosome is maintained within an optimal range. Inactivation of Topo I is tolerated only in the presence of compensatory mutations in gyrase that act to reduce its activity. In the case of Topo III, there is more known about its biochemical activities than its role in the cell. Topo III was detected originally as a superhelical DNA relaxing activity present in extracts prepared from cells deficient in Topo I (6Dean F. Krasnow M.A. Otter R. Matzuk M.M. Spengler S.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1983; 47: 769-777Google Scholar) and as an activity that bound to novobiocin affinity columns (7Srivenugopal K.S. Lockshon D. Morris D.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1899-1906Google Scholar). We purified Topo III as an activity capable of decatenating replicating daughter chromosomes (8DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13366-13373Google Scholar) after we determined that gyrase was inefficient at this task (9Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Google Scholar). Whereas Topo III was inefficient at superhelical DNA relaxation, requiring high temperature for optimal activity, it was very efficient at decatenating multiply linked daughter chromosomes as long as one of the DNA circles contained a small gap. These observations suggested that the productive binding site for the enzyme was single-stranded DNA (10DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Google Scholar), which has been borne out by all subsequent studies. Cloning of the gene for Topo III (topB (10DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Google Scholar)) indicated that the protein had considerable identity to Topo I, although it lacked the zinc finger region of the latter enzyme. Rothstein and colleagues (11Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Google Scholar) reported contemporaneously that EDR1, a gene in yeast that, when mutated, caused enhanced deletion ofSUP4-o when it was flanked by δ sequences (the long terminal repeats of the Tyretrotransposon) (12Rothstein R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 629-637Google Scholar), encoded a protein that had significant similarity to E. coli Topo I and therefore renamed the geneTOP3. TOP3 was actually more homologous to E. coli Topo III than to E. coli Topo I and proved to be the first eukaryotic member of the Topo III family identified. Disruption of topB was noted originally not to cause any obvious phenotype (10DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17924-17930Google Scholar). Subsequently, Schofield et al. (13Schofield M.A. Agbunag R. Michaels M.L. Miller J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5168-5170Google Scholar) showed that mutR, a gene that, when mutated, caused a 5-fold increase in RecA-independent recombination between short directly repeated sequences, was allelic with topB. To date, this observation describes the only known phenotype of topBdeficiencies over an otherwise wild-type background. Interestingly, the situation in eukaryotes is very different, where the phenotypes of deficiencies in Top3 clearly indicate that the enzyme plays a significant role in the maintenance of genomic integrity. Deletion ofTOP3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae causes a slow growth phenotype, the hyper-recombination phenotype mentioned above (11Wallis J.W. Chrebet G. Brodsky G. Rolfe M. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 58: 409-419Google Scholar), and sensitivity to several DNA-damaging agents as a result of disruption of the intra-S phase checkpoint (14Chakraverty R.K. Kearsey J.M. Oakley T.J. Grenon M. de La Torre Ruiz M.A. Lowndes N.F. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7150-7162Google Scholar). InSchizosaccharomyces pombe, TOP3 is an essential gene. Cells deleted for TOP3 undergo only a few rounds of abnormal nuclear division before death (15Goodwin A. Wang S.W. Toda T. Norbury C. Hickson I.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4050-4058Google Scholar, 16Maftahi M. Han C.S. Langston L.D. Hope J.C. Zigouras N. Freyer G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4715-4724Google Scholar). In this organism, dysregulation of Top3 function has been linked to low Cdc2-cyclin B activity, causing a defect in the late stages of homologous recombination (17Caspari T. Murray J.M. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1195-1208Google Scholar). In vertebrates, there are two Top3 isozymes, α (18Hanai R. Caron P.R. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3653-3657Google Scholar) and β (19Seki T. Seki M. Onodera R. Katada T. Enomoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28553-28556Google Scholar). Deletion of the former causes embryonic lethality in mice (20Li W. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1010-1013Google Scholar). Many of these effects are thought to be manifested via interaction, or the lack thereof, of Top3 with members of the RecQ-like family of DNA helicases (21Wu L. Karow J.K. Hickson I.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R518-R520Google Scholar). Here we show that E. coli Topo III can act as the principal cellular decatenase, capable of unlinking replicating daughter chromosomes in vivo, and provide evidence that this decatenation proceeds via the removal of precatenanes. Restriction enzymes and bacteriophage T4 DNA ligase were from New England Biolabs.Pfu polymerase was from Stratagene. Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membrane and ECL-Western blotting detection reagents were from Amersham Biosciences. DNA polymerase I, RNase H, and E. coli DNA ligase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Topo III was prepared from a topA− strain as described (22Hiasa H. DiGate R.J. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2093-2099Google Scholar). ParE and ParC were purified as described by Peng and Marians (23Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24481-24490Google Scholar). DNA gyrase was prepared as described (9Minden J.S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9316-9325Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera against Topo III was raised in rabbits. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was from Bio-Rad. W3110parE10and C600parC1215, described previously by Kato and colleagues (24Kato J. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3967-3977Google Scholar, 25Kato J. Nishimura Y. Imamura R. Niki H. Hiraga S. Suzuki H. Cell. 1990; 63: 393-404Google Scholar), were obtained from the laboratory of N. Cozzarelli (University of California, Berkeley). W3110 was from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. DH5-α, which was used to prepare all plasmid DNAs, was from Invitrogen. Cultures were grown in Luria broth or on Luria agar plates. Antibiotics, when added, were at the following concentrations: 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Competent cells were prepared by CaCl2 treatment. Cells were grown in LB with appropriate antibiotics to an A 600 of 0.5. Equal volumes of cell culture and a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde and 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in 1× phosphate-buffered saline were mixed, and the cells were fixed for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotator. Aliquots (40 μl) of the fixed cells were spread on polylysine-coated glass slides and allowed to air-dry. Samples were observed with an Olympus AX-70 microscope. Fluorescence and differential interference contrast images were acquired with an Hamamatsu Orca-ER CCD camera using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging). Figures were prepared for publication using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. The construction of the pBR-kan-inc3 suppressor library has been described (26Levine C. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1232-1240Google Scholar). pBR-suppressor-6 is a plasmid from the pBR-kan-inc3 suppressor library carrying the genomic insert described under “Results.” pBR-suppressor-6(ΔtopB) was constructed by digesting pBR-suppressor-6 with HpaI, which cuts the plasmid once intopB about 800 bp downstream of the start codon, and withScaI, which cuts the plasmid once about 900 bp upstream of the start codon of topB, within the gene encoding β-lactamase, gel purifying the larger of the two DNA fragments produced, and religating it. pBADtopB was constructed by inserting an NaeI-SmaI DNA fragment from pTBE302 (the gift of R. DiGate, University of Maryland) that containedaraC as well as the topB ORF under the control of the ara promoter into the EcoRV site of pBR-kan-inc3. pLEXparE has been described previously (27Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Google Scholar). The technique of Link et al. (28Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Google Scholar) was used. A DNA fragment was constructed by overlap PCR such that 33 random, coding bp were inserted in-frame between the ATG and TAA codons of parE flanked by about 700 bp of upstream and downstream genomic sequence. The extreme outside primers also contained a BamHI site. The DNA was digested with BamHI and introduced into the BamHI site of pKO3, which carries cat and sacB, and is replicated via a temperature-sensitive pSC101 origin, to give pKO3parEk/o. This plasmid was transformed into W3110, and the transformants were plated at 42 °C. A chloramphenicol-resistant colony was used to grow cells for transformation with pLEXparE (27Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Google Scholar) at 42 °C. A single chloramphenicol-resistant, ampicillin-resistant (because of pLEXparE) colony was diluted in media and plated at 30 °C on plates containing 80 μm IPTG, 5% sucrose, and ampicillin. These colonies were then replica-plated in the presence and absence of IPTG and also checked for chloramphenicol sensitivity. A chloramphenicol sensitive-, IPTG-dependent colony was then checked by PCR for the presence of the genomic parE deletion that has the sequence Met-His-Ala-Ile-Thr-Leu-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ile-Tyr-Asn replacing the parE ORF. The sequence of the parE gene in W3110parE10 was determined by sequencing a PCR fragment made from the genomic DNA. The only amino acid substitution present was C316Y. The overexpression plasmid pET21a-parE10 was constructed by introducing a PCR fragment made from W3110parE10 genomic DNA carrying the parE ORF flanked by NdeI and BamHI sites. ParEC316Y expressed from this plasmid was insoluble. Therefore, we transferred the expression cassette from pET3C-parC (23Peng H. Marians K.J. J. Biol.

This proved effective and yielded soluble Topo IV. ParEC316Y Topo IV was then purified from BL21(DE3)(pET21a-parE10, pBR-kan-inc3-(pET)parC) after soluble lysis by sequential chromatography on Q-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and Superose 6. In the presence of excess ParC, the specific activities of ParEC316Y and wild-type Topo IV were essentially identical in the superhelical DNA relaxation assay. Titrations were used to determine the amount of Topo IV required to effect either 80% superhelical DNA relaxation or decatenation. Mutant and wild-type Topo IV was then heated (in 5-μl aliquots) at 20-fold this concentration at 50 °C for the times indicated in Fig. 3 and then chilled on ice. Superhelical DNA relaxation assays (27Mossessova E. Levine C. Peng H. Nurse P. Bahng S. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4099-4103Google Scholar) and kinetoplast DNA decatenation (29Nurse P. Bahng S. Mossessova E. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4104-4111Google Scholar) assays were then as described previously with 1 μl of the heat-treated Topo IV being added to 20-μl reaction mixtures. The extent of the reactions was quantitated using Bio-Rad Quantity One software from digital images of the ethidium bromide-stained gels. Precatenated DNA was prepared in oriC replication reactions increased in volume 40-fold (30Hiasa H. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6058-6063Google Scholar) using χ-1 plasmid DNA (31Xu L. Marians K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14321-14328Google Scholar) as a template. This pBR322-based plasmid carries oriC and two Ter sites oriented to block replication forks coming from oriC, one 2 kb downstream from oriC in the counterclockwise direction and the other 3 kb downstream from oriC in the clockwise direction. Thus, when Tus is included in the replication reaction mixture, replication is terminated at the Ter sites, leaving 1 kb of unreplicated DNA. A significant fraction of the excess positive linkages generated during replication persist as precatenanes in this replication product (32Peter B.J. Ullsperger C. Hiasa H. Marians K.J. Cozzarelli N.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 819-827Google Scholar). The precatenated DNA was treated with SDS and proteinase K, isolated by gel filtration through Bio-Gel A-5M, and concentrated by lyophilization before use. Standard precatenane unlinking reaction mixtures (5 μl) containing 50 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgOAC, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.8 nm precatenated DNA, and the indicated concentrations of the different topoisomerases were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA to 20 mm,and the DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis at 1.5 V/cm for 15 h through vertical 1% agarose gels using 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.8 at 23 °C), 40 mm NaOAC, and 1 mm EDTA as the buffer. The gels were dried, exposed to a PhosphorImager screen, and autoradiographed. We previously conducted a screen for high copy suppressors of the conditional lethality of W3110parE10(26Levine C. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1232-1240Google Scholar), which revealed an interaction between Topo IV and the τ and γ subunits of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. Further investigation of this observation led to the discovery that the Topo IV activity was temporally regulated during the cell cycle (33Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Google Scholar). Here we conducted a screen for high copy suppressors of the conditional lethality of C600parC1215 (24Kato J. Nishimura Y. Yamada M. Suzuki H. Hirota Y. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3967-3977Google Scholar). A plasmid library (26Levine C. Marians K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1232-1240Google Scholar) was generated by inserting size-selected E. coli genomic DNA into a pBR322 vector (pBR322-kan-inc3) that carried a mutation giving it a slightly higher copy number than normal. All E. coli genes present in this library were expressed from their natural promoters. Library DNA was transformed into C600parC1215, and about 80,000 transformants were plated at 42 °C. Of the 13 colonies that grew, 6 regrew at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. Plasmid DNA was isolated from these six clones and retransformed into C600parC1215. Plasmid DNA from all six potential suppressor clones conferred to C600parC1215 the ability to grow at 42 °C (Table I). This screen yielded four different genes that functioned as high copy suppressors of the temperature sensitivity of parC1215: parC (two clones), as expected; topB (two clones), as discussed in this report; dnaN (one clone), encoding the β subunit of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; and spcA(suppressor of parC A) (one clone), an integral membrane protein that links chromosome segregation to cellular architecture. The interaction of the proteins encoded by these latter two genes with Topo IV will be the subject of a separate report.Table IRescue of Topo IV temperature-sensitive strains by overexpression of Topo IIIPlasmidPlating efficiency (42/30 °C)C600parC1215W3110 parE10pBR suppressor-60.120.99pBR suppressor-6(ΔtopB)<0.02NDaND, not determined.pBADtopB0.460.97Overnight cultures grown at the permissive temperature were diluted to an A 600 of 0.02 and grown in LB broth at the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures to an A 600of 0.5–1.0, diluted by 105, plated (50–100 μl), and grown overnight on LB agar plates.

All solid and liquid media contained antibiotics and arabinose (30 mm), as required. The ends of the genomic DNA insert in pBR-suppressor-6 were determined using primers flanking the BamHI insertion site in the vector. These sequence data were then used to position the genomic insert on the sequence of the E. coli chromosome (34Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Google Scholar). The genomic insert was found to be 5,769 bp long, spanning nucleotides 1,842,971–1,848,740 of the E. coli chromosome. This chromosomal region included the genes topB, selD,ydjA, and sppA. Given that topB was, of this group of genes, the most likely candidate for the suppressor, we digested pBR-suppressor-6 with both ScaI andHpaI and religated to form pBR-suppressor-6 (ΔtopB). HpaI cuts the suppressor clone once within topB about 800 bp downstream from the start of the gene and ScaI cuts once about 900 bp upstream of the 5′-end of the genomic insert, within the previously disrupted gene encoding β-lactamase. pBR-suppressor-6(ΔtopB) failed to rescue the temperature-sensitive phenotype of C600parC1215 (TableI), supporting the argument that topB was the suppressor gene. To confirm that this was the case, the topB ORF was introduced to the suppressor vector under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter, giving plasmid pBADtopB. Interestingly, in the presence of 30 mm arabinose, this plasmid effected a better rescue of the parC1215 allele at 42 °C than the original suppressor clone (Table I). This observation suggested that the efficiency of rescue by Topo III was dose-dependent, an issue that is explored below. If rescue by Topo III was a result of substitution of its topoisomerase activity for that of Topo IV, it seemed reasonable to expect that the various suppressor plasmids would also rescue the temperature sensitivity of W3110parE10. This was the case (Table I). For reasons that are unclear, rescue was more complete for each plasmid in the parE mutant strain compared with the parCmutant strain. Stationary overnight cultures grown at 42 °C of W3110(pBADtopB) and W3110parE10(pBADtopB) were diluted to anA 600 of 0.02 in fresh media, and the growth of the cultures were followed at 42 °C (Fig.1 A). The wild-type culture commenced growth immediately; on the other hand, the mutant culture exhibited a pronounced lag but then grew at a rate that was roughly the same as the wild-type culture. It should be noted that under the conditions described, W3110parE10 itself will not grow at all, all cells having reached a terminal phenotype during the original overnight incubation at the non-permissive temperature. Furthermore, examination of the cell and nucleoid morphology under conditions oftopB rescue demonstrated that Topo III was acting to decatenate the daughter chromosomes (Fig. 1, B andC). Wild-type and mutant parE10 cells grown at 30 °C in the presence of pBADtopB and arabinose gave essentially indistinguishable morphologies with about 95% of the population appearing as small cells with either two or four nucleoids. The other 5% of the population was made up of an assortment of abnormally appearing cells (Fig. 1, B and C). When these two strains were grown at the non-permissive temperature as described above, the fraction of wild-type appearing cells in the W3110(pBADtopB) culture decreased to 83%, and there was a significant fraction of small cells with condensed, non-separated nucleoids (type 2, Fig. 1 C). In addition, filaments could be observed that contained nucleoids that either were condensed (type 6, Fig. 1 C) or appeared normal (type 5, Fig. 1 C); anucleates were observed as well (type 3, Fig. 1 C). Interestingly, the largest population of abnormally appearing cells were small cells clearly containing two nucleoids that were linked together by DNA (type 4, Fig. 1 C), suggesting that either chromosome decatenation or segregation was delayed at 42 °C compared with 30 °C. On the other hand, whereas the culture of W3110parE10(pBADtopB) grown at the non-permissive temperature contained a significant fraction of wild-type appearing cells (43%, Fig. 1 C), the proportion of type 2 and type 3 cells was elevated, suggesting that the rescue by overexpression of Topo III was not completely penetrant. However, when compared with the cellular morphologies present in a culture of W3110parE10 grown at the non-permissive temperature, it was clear that overexpression of Topo III resulted in rescue of the Topo IV defect and effected decatenation of the daughter chromosomes. W3110par10(pBR-kan-inc3) cells grown overnight at 30 °C, diluted by 100-fold, and then shifted to 42 °C for 2 h exhibited a classic par phenotype (Fig. 1 B). Half the cells in the population were long filaments with either a central very large, dense nucleoid or two symmetrically placed, somewhat smaller dense nucleoids. The other half of the population consisted of anucleate cells (Fig. 1 C). No wild-type cells were observed at all. pBR-suppressor-6 and pBADtopB exhibited different efficiencies of rescue of C600parC1215, suggesting that there was a certain minimal level of Topo III needed to effect chromosome decatenation. We therefore examined the levels of Topo III produced from these plasmids in W3110parE10 growing at 42 °C (Fig. 2). We used theparE10 strain, rather than C600parC1215, because in the former strain both plasmids rescued to the same extent, suggesting that we would obtain an unbiased value for the extent of overproduction. The pBRsuppressor-6 plasmid produced about 60-fold more Topo III at 42 °C than was present in W3110parE10 at 30 °C, whereas the pBADtopB overproduced Topo III by about 180-fold. The level of Topo III in wild-type cells is very low, having been estimated at about 10 copies per cell. Our current estimate for Topo IV is about 1000 copies per cell (33Espeli O. Levine C. Hassing H. Marians K.J. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 189-201Google Scholar); thus, Topo III works effectively as the cellular decatenase when it is present at roughly the same concentration as Topo IV. If the observed rescue by Topo III was a result of it substituting completely for the activity of Topo IV, then overexpression of Topo III should also rescue E. coli in the complete absence of Topo IV. To assess this issue, we constructed a conditional parE null strain. W3110ΔparE(pLEXparE) carries a precise deletion of the chromosomal parE covered by an expression plasmid (pLEX5BA (35Diederich L. Roth A. Messer W. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 916-923Google Scholar)) where the parE ORF is under the tightly regulated control of a modified lac operator. Consequently, growth of this strain at any temperature is dependent on the presence of IPTG to induce ParE expression. pBADtopB could not rescue growth of this strain at 37 °C in the presence of arabinose when IPTG was omitted from the culture medium. In the presence and absence of arabinose to induce Topo III expression, the plating efficiency of W3110ΔparE(pLEXparE, pBADtopB) was 0.96 (with arabinose/without arabinose) when IPTG was also present. In the absence of IPTG, no growth was observed at all in either the presence or absence of arabinose. We considered three explanations for the lack of rescue of the parE deletion strain. The first relates to the possibility that the observed rescue by overexpression of Topo III in the temperature-sensitive parE andparC strains was dependent on a partial level of Topo IV decatenation activity, and therefore, because the ParE deletion strain had no Topo IV, higher levels of Topo III were required to effect rescue. To address this possibility, we constructed a modified topBexpression vector that could produce higher levels of Topo III than pBADtopB; however, we found that even modest increases in the levels of Topo III expression over those produced by pBADtopB were toxic to wild-type cells. Thus, we probed the nature of the Topo IV activity present in W3110parE10 by purifying the mutant protein (the amino acid substitution is C316Y) and assaying its activity in vitro (Fig.3). Both the superhelical DNA relaxation and the decatenation activity of ParEC316Y Topo IV was exquisitely temperature-sensitive compared with the wild-type protein, which showed only minimal heat inactivation even after 20 min at 50 °C. It thus seems unlikely that there is any residual available topoisomerase activity of Topo IV under the conditions of Topo III rescue of the temperature-sensitive strains described above. We also note that W3110parE10 was completely rescued by the pBR-suppressor-6 plasmid. pBADtopB produced 3-fold more Topo III than pBR-suppressor-6, a relationship that was maintained in W3110ΔparE(pLEXparE) (Fig. 2), yet still could not rescue the null strain. We therefore conclude that overexpression of Topo III to levels roughly comparable with those of Topo IV in wild-type cells allow it to substitute completely for the chromosome decatenation activity of the latter enzyme. The second possibility is that W3110ΔparE(pLEXparE) cannot be rescued in the absence of IPTG because the presence of ParC in the cell unfettered by association with ParE is toxic. This possibility is difficult to discount; however, we note that overexpression of Topo III did, in fact, rescue the temperature-sensitive parE strain, where, presumably, because the ParEC316Y mutation is likely to cause folding defects, at the nonpermissive temperature the same situation holds,i.e. there is a surfeit of free ParC in the cell. On the other hand, our experience with various parC expression constructs is consistent with high level, overexpression of ParC being toxic to wild-type cells. A third possibility is that the failure of Topo III overexpression to rescue the parE deletion strain reflects a physical requirement for ParE at some stage of the cell cycle and that this requirement is distinct from the requirement for ParE to form Topo IV that is active for decatenation.

Both effects required the putative N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCβ2. Importantly, Rac2(12V) dramatically increased the contribution of exchange to the fluorescence recovery of GFP-PLCβ2, but had the opposite effect on GFP-PLCβ2Δ, where lateral diffusion became dominant.

As for all PLCβ isozymes, activation by αq requires the C-terminal region of PLCβ2, and mutants carrying deletions in this region, such as the mutant PLCβ2Δ that lacks the Phe819-Glu1166 segment, are resistant to stimulation by αq but are susceptible to activation by Rho GTPases and G protein βγ subunits (3Rhee S.G.

Thus, the PLCβ2 catalytic subdomains X and Y are sufficient for efficient stimulation by βγ, whereas the putative pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCβ2 is absolutely required for stimulation by Rho GTPases (6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 30, 10.1074/jbc.M211971200)Google Scholar). Among the Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Rac2 are more potent stimulators than Cdc42 (6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 30, 10.1074/jbc.M211971200)Google Scholar). Evidence for a tight connection between PLCβ2 and Rho GTPases in cells is provided by the chemoattractant receptor system, whose activation stimulates PLCβ2 and Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 (8Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Google Scholar, 9Akasaki T. Koga H. Sumimoto H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18055-18059Google Scholar, 10Benard V. Bohl B.P. Bokoch G.M. J. Biol.

Moreover, in accord with our in vitro studies on PLCβ2 activation by Rho GTPases (4Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Google Scholar, 6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 30, 10.1074/jbc.M211971200)Google Scholar), a recent study conducted on myeloid-differentiated HL-60 cells demonstrated that dominant-negative Cdc42 disrupted the stimulation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation mediated via the chemoattractant receptors while inhibiting Rac2 activation (12Rabiet M.J. Tardif M. Braun L. Boulay F. Blood. 2002; 100: 1835-1844Google Scholar). These findings strongly support the notion that Rac2 and possibly Rac1 and Cdc42 are critically involved in receptor-mediated stimulation of PLCβ2 activity. To date, the molecular mechanism of PLCβ stimulation by either heterotrimeric G proteins or Rho GTPases is largely unknown. The lipid nature of the substrate emphasizes the importance of understanding the mode of PLCβ2 association with the membrane and its regulation by multiple stimulators (13McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Google Scholar). However, the knowledge and understanding of these processes are still lacking, especially in live cells. For example, the postulated recruitment of PLCβ by heterotrimeric G proteins to the membrane could not be supported by experimental data (14Romoser V. Ball R. A V.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Google Scholar, 15Runnels L.W. Jenco J. Morris A. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16824-16832Google Scholar, 16Jenco J.M. Becker K.P. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 431-437Google Scholar). Therefore, interactions with other proteins could determine the cellular localization of PLCβ. Here, we investigated the membrane interactions of PLCβ2 and their modulation by the constitutively active Rho GTPase Rac2(12V). Rho GTPases have been shown to regulate a wide range of cellular functions in their active GTP-bound state, including reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, gene expression and cell cycle progression (reviewed in Refs. 17Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Google Scholar, 18Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Google Scholar, 19Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Google Scholar). Rho GTPases in their inactive, GDP-bound states are present in the cytosol complexed with guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) (20Fukumoto Y. Kaibuchi K. Hori Y. Fujioka H. Araki S. Ueda T. Kikuchi A. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1321-1328Google Scholar, 21Isomura M. Kikuchi A. Ohga N. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 119-124Google Scholar). Upon stimulation, Rho GTPases are released from the GDI, translocated from the cytosol to specific membranes (22Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Google Scholar, 23Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Google Scholar, 24Michaelson D. Silletti J. Murphy G. D'Eustachio P. Rush M. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 111-126Google Scholar) and activated (undergo GDP/GTP exchange) by guanine nucleotide exchange factors containing a Dbl homology domain (25Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Google Scholar). The translocation of Rho GTPases from the cytosol to membranes following their activation offers the intriguing possibility that activated Rho GTPases target a soluble PLCβ2 to its membrane-associated substrate. To gain more insight into the role of Rac2 in regulating the membrane interactions and activation of PLCβ2 in live cells, we have generated green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged PLCβ2 (GFP-PLCβ2) and GFP-PLCβ2Δ. The enzymatic activity of these constructs was greatly enhanced in the presence of constitutively active Rac2(V12) in transfected cells. To study the lateral diffusion of the GFP-PLCβ2 constructs in the plasma membrane and/or their exchange between membrane-bound and cytoplasmic pools, we employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Both forms of PLCβ2 exhibited a mixture of exchange and lateral diffusion, suggesting transient association with the plasma membrane of live cells. Constitutively active Rac2(12V), but not wild-type (wt) Rac2 (Rac2(wt)), slowed down the fluorescence recovery times of GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ and increased their translocation to the membrane. These effects, which suggest enhanced membrane association, specifically required the putative PH domain of PLCβ2, which could not be replaced by the equivalent region of GFP-PLCβ1. Our studies reveal that the effects of Rac2(12V) on the mode of PLCβ2-membrane interactions depend on its C-terminal region, whose presence is required for the exchange to become dominant in response to activated Rac2. These observations implicate the PLCβ2 C-terminal region, known to interact with Gαq and to be capable of dimerization (26Singer A.U. Waldo G.L. Harden T.K. Sondek J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 32-36Google Scholar), in a new role- regulating the exchange of PLCβ2 after its recruitment to the plasma membrane by activated Rac2.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Google Scholar) were produced by ligation of the respective coding sequences without noncoding sequences into theBamHI/EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen). To add a HA epitope tag to a construct, a 5′ primer containing the sequence encoding the epitope was used. The cDNAs of PLCβ2 and the deletion mutant PLCβ2Δ, lacking a C-terminal region necessary for stimulation by αq subunits (Phe819-Glu1166) were inserted in-frame with GFP into the EcoRI/SalI site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) to generate plasmids encoding GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ. The cDNA of the PLCβ1/PLCβ2 chimera was generated by replacing the cDNA sequence encoding the N-terminal amino acids of PLCβ2 (residues 1–138) by the corresponding residues of PLCβ1 (1–142) using the PCR overlap extension method. The chimeric cDNA was inserted into pEGFP-N1 as described above to generate the GFP-PLCβ1/PLCβ2 plasmid. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum as described (27Ehrlich M. Shmuely A. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1777-1786Google Scholar). For FRAP and confocal microscopy experiments, COS-7 cells grown on glass coverslips in 35-mm dishes were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (28Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Google Scholar) with 150 ng of plasmid DNA encoding one of the GFP-PLCβ2 derivatives together with 850 ng of plasmid DNA encoding either untagged or HA-tagged Rac2(wt), Rac2(12V), or RhoA(14V); cells singly transfected with a GFP-PLCβ2 derivative received instead 850 ng of empty pcDNA3.1 vector DNA. 24-h post-transfection, they were taken for the FRAP or confocal microscopy studies. For studies on stimulation of GFP-PLCβ2, COS-7 or HEK293 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells per well and grown overnight in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen), adding to each well 1 μg of DNA mixed with 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). In co-transfection experiments, 0.5 μg of cDNA encoding GFP-PLCβ2 constructs and 0.1 μg of cDNA encoding Rac2 constructs was added. The total amount of DNA was maintained constant by adding pcDNA3.1(+). HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the same amounts of DNA using CalPhos Mammalian Transfection Kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mouse anti-GFP antibodies were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, rabbit anti-Rac2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and HA.11 rabbit serum against the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag (Ref. 29Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Google Scholar; anti-HA) from Covance. Alexa 594-conjuated goat anti-rabbit (GαR) IgG was from Molecular Probes, and normal goat IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Peroxidase-conjugated GαR and anti-mouse IgG were from Sigma. The lipid analogue 1,1′-dihexadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiIC16) was obtained from Molecular Probes and incorporated into the plasma membrane of live cells as described (30Niv H. Gutman O. Henis Y.I. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1606-1613Google Scholar).Myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (22–24 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. FRAP studies were conducted as described earlier (31Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Google Scholar, 32Koppel D.E. Axelrod D. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1315-1329Google Scholar), using previously described instrumentation (33Henis Y.I. Gutman O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 762: 281-288Google Scholar). The experiments were performed 24–26 h post-transfection on COS-7 cells plated on glass coverslips and transfected with GFP-PLCβ2 derivatives as described above. All experiments were done at 22 °C, in Hank's balanced salt solution supplemented with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. The monitoring Argon ion laser beam (488 nm, 1.2 microwatt) was focused through the microscope (Zeiss Universal) to a Gaussian radius of 0.85 ± 0.02 μm (63× objective) or 1.36 ± 0.04 μm (40× objective). A brief pulse (6 milliwatts, 4–6 ms for the 63× objective, and 10–20 ms for the 40× objective) bleached 50–70% of the fluorescence in the illuminated region. The time course of fluorescence recovery was followed by the attenuated monitoring beam. The apparent characteristic fluorescence recovery time (τ), and the mobile fraction were derived by nonlinear regression analysis, fitting to a lateral diffusion process with a single τ value (34Petersen N.O. Felder S. Elson E.L. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.A. Blackwell C.C. Herzenberg L.A. Handbook of Experimental Immunology. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Edinburgh1986: 24.21-24.23Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was employed to detect the co-localization of GFP-PLCβ2 with HA-Rac2(12V) at the plasma membrane. COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-PLCβ2 together with HA-tagged Rac2(wt), Rac2(12V), or RhoA(14V) as described under cell culture and transfections. After 24 h, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (45 min, 22 °C) and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (5 min) in the same buffer. After blocking with normal goat IgG (200 μg/ml, 22 °C, 30 min, in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin), they were incubated successively in the same buffer (1 h, 22 °C, with three extensive washes after each incubation) with the following antibodies: (i) rabbit anti-HA (1:3500 dilution) and (ii) Alexa 594-GαR IgG (5 μg/ml). The cells were mounted with Prolong antifade solution (Molecular Probes) and subjected to analysis by immunofluorescence microscopy. 24 h post-transfection, COS-7 or HEK293 cells were washed with PBS.Myo-[2-3H(N)]inositol (10 μCi/ml) was added, followed by addition of LiCl 20 min after addition of radiolabeled inositol to a final concentration of 10 mm. Incubation was continued for 18 h. Inositol phosphate formation was stopped and total inositol phosphates were then separated and measured as described (35Offermanns S. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15175-15180Google Scholar). In vitro phospholipase C activity was determined using phospholipid vesicles containing [3H]PtdInsP2as described previously (5Illenberger D. Stephan I. Gierschik P. Schwald F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 167-177Google Scholar). For subcellular fractionation, HEK293 cells (2.7 × 106) were grown on 100-mm dishes. They were transiently transfected using the CalPhos transfection kit (Clontech) with vectors encoding GFP-PLCβ2 derivatives (7 μg of DNA) alone or together with plasmids encoding Rac2 derivatives (7 μg of DNA). After 24 h, the cells were scraped into 0.15 ml of hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 3 mm benzamidine, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) and disrupted by 10 passages through a 0.5 × 25 mm needle. After removal of nuclei by centrifugation (300 × g, 10 min), particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were separated by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 15 min). Soluble and particulate fractions (80 μg of protein) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-GFP or anti-Rac2 antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences). To study the effect of wild-type and constitutively active Rac2 on the activity of PLCβ2 and on its interactions with the plasma membrane in live cells, we prepared GFP fusion proteins of full-length human PLCβ2 and of the C-terminal deletion mutant PLCβ2Δ. To confirm that the GFP tag did not impair their activities, both GFP-PLCβ2and GFP-PLCβ2Δ were expressed in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, and reconstituted in a cell-free system with G protein βγ dimers or GTPγS-activated Rac2 and phospholipid vesicles containing [3H]-labeled PtdInsP2 as described earlier (4Illenberger D. Schwald F. Pimmer D. Binder W. Maier G. Dietrich A. Gierschik P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6241-6249Google Scholar, 5Illenberger D. Stephan I. Gierschik P. Schwald F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 167-177Google Scholar). The activities of both GFP constructs were greatly stimulated by either 1 mm free Ca2+, G protein βγ dimers, or GTPγS-activated Rac2 (not shown); these responses were similar to those observed with the untagged enzymes. To investigate whether the activity of GFP-PLCβ2 is stimulated by activated Rac2 in intact cells, the production of inositol phosphates was measured in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with vector containing the cDNA encoding each GFP-PLCβ2 construct, either alone or together with vector containing the cDNAs encoding Rac2(wt) or Rac2(12V). Immunochemical analysis of whole cell lysates of the transfected cells using anti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 1, inset) indicated that the cells expressed equal amounts of the GFP constructs (170 and 130 kDa for GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ, respectively), which were absent from cells transfected with control plasmid. Fig. 1 demonstrates that no stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by Rac2(wt) and Rac2(12V) was detected in cells expressing GFP alone. Little, if any, stimulation was observed in cells singly transfected with a vector encoding GFP-PLCβ2. In contrast, co-expression of Rac2(12V), but not of Rac2(wt), with GFP-PLCβ2 caused a marked (∼17-fold) stimulation of inositol phosphate formation. Similar results (not shown) were obtained when HEK293 cells were employed in place of COS-7 cells, or when Rac2(12V) or Rac2(wt) carrying an N-terminal HA tag replaced the untagged Rac constructs. Rac2(12V), but not the wild-type protein also activated GFP-PLCβ2Δ; the only difference from PLCβ2 was that the Rac2-induced stimulation was somewhat lower (∼14-fold) (Fig. 1). The ability of constitutively active Rac to stimulate both GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ is in accord with earlier in vitro studies on the untagged forms of these proteins, although the extent of stimulation was higher for PLCβ2Δ than for PLCβ2 in the cell-free system (36Illenberger D. Schwald F. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 71-77Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are currently unknown, but may be related to the fact that the substrate is presented in artificial phospholipid vesicles rather than in native membrane bilayers in the cell-free system. To further characterize the mechanisms of GFP-PLCβ2activation by Rac2(12V), we employed a GFP-tagged PLCβ1/PLCβ2 chimera. In this chimera, the N-terminal putative PH domain of PLCβ2 (amino acids 1–138) was swapped with the equivalent region of PLCβ1(amino acids 1–142), resulting in an isozyme, which is barely activated by Rho GTPases (36Illenberger D. Schwald F. Gierschik P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 71-77Google Scholar). PLCβ1/PLCβ2has recently been shown to be sensitive to stimulation by βγ dimers, but not by GTPγS-activated Rho GTPases, in a cell-free system (6Illenberger D. Walliser C. Nurnberg B. Diaz Lorente M. Gierschik P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; (December 30, 10.1074/jbc.M211971200)Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that this chimera was not activated by Rac2(12V) in intact COS-7 cells, demonstrating a specific requirement for the N-terminal region of PLCβ2. To investigate the mechanism by which Rac2(12V) mediates PLCβ2 stimulation, we examined the ability of activated Rac2 to induce translocation of GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ from the cytoplasm to the membrane fraction. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with a GFP-PLCβ2construct together with either empty vector or vectors encoding Rac2(wt) or Rac2(12V). Transfected cells were fractionated, and aliquots of the postnuclear particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-GFP or anti-Rac antibodies. Fig. 2 shows that GFP-PLCβ2and GFP-PLCβ2Δ were soluble either with or without co-expression of Rac2(wt). In contrast, co-expression with Rac2(12V) resulted in translocation of considerable amounts of GFP-PLCβ2 or GFP-PLCβ2Δ to the particulate fraction (Fig. 2). This effect was not observed when the GFP-PLCβ1/PLCβ2 chimera was co-expressed with Rac2(12V). The above effects were obtained on cells expressing similar levels of Rac2(wt) and Rac2(12V) (Fig. 2). Similar results (not shown) were obtained with HA-Rac2(wt) and HA-Rac2(12V). These findings indicate that constitutively active Rac2 effectively mediates translocation of GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ to the particulate membrane fraction, and that this effect requires the putative PH domain of PLCβ2. To obtain further support for this notion in whole cells, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy analysis. Since a large fraction of GFP-PLCβ2 remains cytosolic even in the presence of activated Rac2, it is difficult to detect its translocation to the plasma membrane by standard fluorescence microscopy. We therefore took advantage of the fact that activated Rac2 is largely associated with the plasma membrane (22Bokoch G.M. Bohl B.P. Chuang T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31674-31679Google Scholar, 23Sasaki T. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 641-645Google Scholar). Thus, analysis of the co-localization of GFP-PLCβ2 with Rac2(12V) allows the identification of membrane translocation of PLCβ2, with the added advantage that Rac2(12V) translocation is visualized simultaneously. To this end, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with vector encoding GFP-PLCβ2 together with vectors encoding either HA-Rac2(12V) or HA-Rac2(wt). The cells were fixed and permeabilized, and the HA-tagged Rac2 proteins were labeled with anti-HA rabbit IgG followed by Alexa 594-GαR IgG. Dual fluorescence images (GFP, green; Alexa 594, red) were collected, overlaid and examined for co-localization using the co-localization function of the confocal imaging program (Zeiss LSM 510). The results of a typical experiment are depicted in Fig. 3. Upon co-expression with HA-Rac2(12V), a large fraction of the GFP-PLCβ2 population became co-localized with HA-Rac2(12V) at the rim of the cells, exhibiting typical plasma membrane labeling (Fig. 3 A,panel ii). On the other hand, this effect was much less pronounced following co-expression with HA-Rac2(wt) (Fig. 3 B,panel ii). The effect is mediated specifically by some Rho GTPases and not by others; this is indicated by the failure of co-expression with HA-RhoA(14V), judged by immunofluorescence to be expressed at levels comparable to those of the HA-tagged Rac2 proteins, to translocate GFP-PLCβ2 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3 C, panel ii). Thus, the Rac2 effect is not mediated indirectly by raising the level of the substrate, PtdInsP2 (see below). Taken together, these data demonstrate that activated Rac2 specifically mediates translocation of GFP-PLCβ2 to the plasma membrane in whole cells. To characterize the interactions of GFP-PLCβ2 derivatives with the plasma membrane in live cells, we conducted FRAP studies on GFP-PLCβ2 and GFP-PLCβ2Δ transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. Because the enzyme is mostly cytosolic, we have focused the laser beam in these measurements on flat cell regions near the cell periphery so that the beam illuminated both top and bottom membranes, and the cytoplasm contribution was relatively low due to the thin cell volume in such regions. The fluorescence recovery of a purely cytoplasmic protein is expected to occur at a very fast rate, due to relatively unrestricted diffusion in the cytosol. This rate is determined by the characteristic fluorescence recovery time τ (the time required to attain half of the recoverable fluorescence intensity for a Gaussian bleach profile) (31Axelrod D. Koppel D.E. Schlessinger J. Elson E.L. Webb W.W. Biophys. J. 1976; 16: 1055-1069Google Scholar). Indeed, the fluorescence recovery of unfused GFP (which is cytosolic) occurred at a rate faster than the experimental time scale (Fig.4 A), resulting in curves showing immediate recovery with extremely short τ. On the other hand, GFP-PLCβ2 fluorescence recovery was significantly slower and could thus be accurately measured under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4 B). This demonstrates that despite its mainly cytosolic localization, GFP-PLCβ2 experiences interactions with cellular structures (most likely the plasma membrane; see below and under “Discussion”) that retard its fluorescence recovery rate (i.e. increase the τ value). In view of the effects of activated Rac2 on the cellular localization of GFP-PLCβ2 (Figs. 2 and 3), we examined the effects of co-expression of GFP-PLCβ2 with Rac2(12V) on the fluorescence recovery rate of GFP-PLCβ2. If the higher τ of GFP-PLCβ2 relative to free cytoplasmic GFP is due to interactions of the enzyme with the plasma membrane, it should be further increased by Rac2(12V). As can be seen in Fig. 4 (showing typical fluorescence recovery curves) and Fig.5 (depicting the average data from many such measurements), this indeed was the case. Co-expression with Rac2(12V) dramatically increased τ of GFP-PLCβ2(3.6-fold). On the other hand, co-expressed Rac2(wt) failed to induce such an effect (Fig. 5). Qualitatively similar results were obtained with GFP-PLCβ2Δ, whose τ value was also elevated (2.9-fold) by co-expression with Rac2(12V) but not with Rac2(wt) (Fig.5). The only difference was that the τ values of GFP-PLCβ2Δ were smaller than those of GFP-PLCβ2 in the absence of Rac2(12V) (1.7-fold) or in its presence (2-fold); these shorter fluorescence recovery times are suggestive of weaker retardation and therefore of weaker interactions with the plasma membrane. These findings are in accord with the contribution of C-terminally located basic residues of PLCβ isozymes to association with the membrane via loose interaction with acidic phospholipids (16Jenco J.M. Becker K.P. Morris A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 431-437Google Scholar, 37Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Google Scholar). The effect of Rac2(12V) on the fluorescence recovery rate of GFP-PLCβ2 requires the putative PH domain of PLCβ2, and cannot be replaced by the equiv"

For the androgen receptor, additional interactions between the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions have been reported. The first amino acids of the amino-terminal domain are necessary for this amino/carboxyl-terminal interaction. Deletion of a FQNLF core sequence in this region blunts the interaction, as does a G21E mutation. We investigated the effect of the aforementioned mutations in the context of the full size androgen receptor on a series of selective and nonselective androgen response elements. Strikingly, the FQNLF deletion strongly reduced the androgen receptor capacity to transactivate through nonselective motifs but did not affect its activity on selective elements. Although the G21E mutation strongly impairs the amino/carboxyl-terminal interaction, it does not significantly influence androgen receptor activity on either selective or nonselective elements. Surprisingly, this mutation leads to an increased binding of the amino-terminal domain to the glutamine-rich region of the steroid receptor coactivator-1 of the p160 family.

The biological actions of androgens are mediated by the androgen receptor (AR).1 The AR is a ligand-activated transcription factor and belongs to the class I subgroup of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Two structural domains are well conserved among the nuclear receptors (NR): the DNA-binding domain (DBD), consisting of two zinc finger modules, and the ligand-binding domain (LBD), containing a transcription activation function (AF-2) (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar, 2Moilanen A. Rouleau N. Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 355-358Google Scholar). The amino-terminal domain (NTD) and the hinge region are more divergent. Because of their highly conserved DBD, it is not surprising that the class I steroid receptors (AR, GR, progesterone receptor, and mineralocorticoid receptor) recognize the same palindromic (inverted) repeats of the 5′-TGTTCT-3′ core sequence, spaced by three nucleotides. The mechanisms that lead to the in vivo steroid specificity of gene regulation are still not completely understood (3Funder J.W. Science. 1993; 259: 1132-1133Google Scholar, 4Cleutjens K.B.J.M.

Selective DNA binding by the AR could be one possible mechanism for hormone-specific gene regulation. It has been reported that the AR-DBD does not only recognize response elements organized as inverted repeats of 5′-TGTTCT-3′ sequences with a three-nucleotide spacer but can also bind to direct repeats of 5′-TGTTCT-3′-like sequences, which is proposed to contribute to the AR specificity of transcriptional responses (7Claessens F.

The NTD of the AR is indispensable for AR transactivation and contains a strong transcription activation function (AF-1). Its activity is affected by coregulators that influence a number of functional properties of AR (15Simental J.A. Sar M. Lane M.V. French F.S. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

The AR depends on a strong amino/carboxyl-terminal (N/C) interaction for its full activity (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar, 40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar, 41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R.

Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1172-1183Google Scholar). These N/C interactions have also been demonstrated in the progesterone receptor (44Tetel M.J. Giangrande P.H. Leonhardt S.A. McDonnell D.P. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 910-924Google Scholar) and the estrogen receptor α (45Kraus W.L. McInerney E.M. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12314-12318Google Scholar, 46Metivier R. Penot G. Flouriot G. Pakdel F. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1953-1970Google Scholar), but in these receptors the implication in receptor activity is less pronounced. The AR N/C interaction involves LKDIL and FQNLF core sequences, both present in predicted α-helical structures within the NTD (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar, 41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Google Scholar). The FQNLF motif is located within the thirty amino-terminal amino acids of the AR and has the ability to bind AF-2 of the carboxyl-terminal domain in an androgen-dependent manner. The LKDIL motif is located between amino acids 178 and 183 and is important for the transcriptional activation function AF-1. In this paper, we describe the involvement of the FQNLF motif and a flanking conserved Gly in the N/C interaction. In addition, we have analyzed the functional role of this interaction on isolated direct and indirect repeat AREs and on AR-specific versus nonspecific enhancers. Our data suggest that the interaction between the AR-NTD and -LBD may be a prerequisite for its transcriptional activity on nonspecific HREs, whereas it is dispensable on specific HREs. The expression vectors pSG5AR538–919 (encoding the hAR-DBD-LBD), pSG5AR (expressing FLAG-tagged full-length hAR), and pSG5SRC-1e and the vector Qr SRC-1 (expressing the Qr domain of SRC-1 fused to the Gal4-DBD) are described elsewhere (14Haelens A.

The Gal4-DBD and the VP16 fusion constructs hAR1–529, hAR1–529ΔFQNLF, and hAR1–529L435P were made by a PCR-based method. The construct hAR1–529 was made by using the following primers: 5′-GGCAGATCTCCATGGAAGTGCAGTTAGGGCTGGG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTCAACGCATGTCCCCGTAAGGTCCGGA-3′. As template, the expression vector for the full-length human AR (pSV-AR), a kind gift of Dr. A. O. Brinkmann (Erasmus University of Nijmegen, Nijmegen, the Netherlands) was used. The ΔFQNLF deletion was generated with the oligonucleotides 5′-CCTACCGAGGAGCTCAGAGCGTCCGCGAAGTG-3′ and 5′-CGCGGACGCTCTGAGCTCCTCGGTAGGTCT-3′. To generate the L435P mutation, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-CCTGGCACACTCCCTTCACAGCCGAAG-3′ and 5′-CTGGCCTTCTTCGGCTGTGAAGGGAGTGTGCCAGGATGAG-3′, in which the mutated base is underlined. These PCR-generated hAR-NTD fragments were inserted in frame with the Gal4-DBD in theBamHI restriction site of pABGal4 and in frame with the VP16 activating domain in the BglII site of pSNATCH-II (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar). Expression vectors for the hAR carrying the FQNLF deletion or the L435P point mutation were made by insertion of aEco52I/Eco81I fragment of the PCR products in the pSG5AR construct, which was cut with the same restriction enzymes. The pSG5 construct expressing the G21E-mutated hAR was generated by coincidence and was detected by sequencing. Restriction and modifying enzymes were obtained from MBI Fermentas GmbH. The luciferase reporter constructs containing the isolated elements TAT-GRE,slp-HRE3, C3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)ARE, slp-HRE2,sc-ARE1.2, slp-HRE2 mut-4T-A;+2A-T, andsc-ARE1.2 mut-4T-A;−2A-T are driven by the thymidine kinase minimal promotor and have been described elsewhere (Ref. 10Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Google Scholar and references therein). The reporter construct driven by the E1b promotor and containing two copies of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase-GRE was described previously (47Verrijdt G. Haelens A. Schoenmakers E. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 97-103Google Scholar). The thymidine kinase minimal promotor-driven reporter construct containing the slp and scupstream enhancers and the C3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar) intronic fragment as well as thepb promotor-driven construct have also been described (10Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Google Scholar). The reporter construct (Gal4)5TATA-Luc, a kind gift from Dr. M. G. Parker (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK), was used for measuring the AF-1 AR activity. The pCMV-β-galactosidase vector was obtained from Stratagene. All of the transfections were performed in COS-7 African green monkey kidney cells, obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). One day prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum at a density of 104cells/well. They were transfected using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. The amount of luciferase reporter construct was fixed on 100 ng/well, and the amount of pCMV-β-galactosidase was fixed at 5 ng/well. Where applicable, empty pGEM-T, empty pSG5, empty pSNATCH-II, or pABGal4 vector was added to keep the total amount of transfected DNA constant. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h with medium containing 5% dextran-coated charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and supplemented or not with hormones (10−8m). The synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Finally, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen) and lysed in 25 μl of passive lysis buffer (Promega). The luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured on 2.5 μl of the extracts using the assay systems from Promega and Tropix (Westburg, the Netherlands), respectively. The luciferase activity was corrected for transfection efficiency by normalizing it according to its β-galactosidase activity. The values shown are the averages of at least three independent experiments performed in triplicate. The error bars are the S.E. values. COS-7 cells were plated in 10-cm Petri dishes and were transiently transfected as described above with 1 μg of expression vectors. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were stimulated for 1 h with R1881 (10−8m). The medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were collected in 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline/dish and pelleted by centrifugation (1 min). The phosphate-buffered saline was removed, and the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold extraction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 450 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm EDTA, and 25% glycerol. Immediately before use, dithiothreitol and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride are added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The samples were freeze-thawed three times. The pellet was collected, and the supernatant was removed and stored at −80 °C. The protein concentrations of the extracts were determined with the Coomassie protein assay kit (Pierce) and were in each case ∼4 μg/μl. Synthetic complementary oligonucleotides were hybridized, radioactively labeled, and used in band shift assays as described previously (14Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Callewaert L. Christiaens V. Schauwaers K. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 141-151Google Scholar). In brief, 5 μl of total cell extract was preincubated with 1 μl of poly(dI-dC) (1 μg/μl), 10 μl of D100 (20 mm Hepes, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 17% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl), 1 μl dithiothreitol (20 mm), 1 μl Triton X-100 (1%), and 1 μl of water. Subsequently, the probe is added and incubated for 20 min on ice. Bound probe was separated from the free by an electrophoresis for 2 h at 120 V in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. To obtain supershifts, a rabbit antiserum against human AR was added prior to the probe (48Marivoet S. Hertogen M. Verhoeven G. Heyns W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1990; 37: 39-45Google Scholar). For Western blotting, equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE on an 8% gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were probed with a monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Stratagene), and immunoreactive proteins were visualized with the chemiluminescence reagent plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For the detection of VP16 fusion proteins, extracts were made in passive lysis buffer. Western blot analysis was performed as described above. Previous studies have shown that an FQNLF motif at position 23 in the amino-terminal domain of the human AR plays a key role in the androgen-dependent interaction between the NTD and the LBD. Another motif (432WHTLF436) was also postulated as a possible interaction site (40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar). We have studied the N/C interaction in a mammalian two-hybrid system using a luciferase reporter construct driven by the E1b promotor and containing a tandem repeat of the rat tyrosine aminotransferase-GRE (2×TAT-GRE(E1b)-Luc). In these experiments we tested and compared three AR-NTD (AR1–529) mutants (Fig. 1 A). The first construct consists of a deletion of the first motif (AR1–529ΔFQNLF). The second construct has a point mutation immediately amino-terminally of the FQNLF motif; Gly21 is mutated to a Glu (AR1–529G21E). This Gly is outside the FQNLF motif but inside a predicted α-helical region and is highly conserved among different species (Fig.1 B). The third construct has a point mutation in the WHTLF motif so that Leu435 is mutated into a Pro (AR1–529L435P). Wild type and mutant forms of the AR-NTD domain were fused to the VP16 transactivation domain and were coexpressed in the mammalian two-hybrid assay with pSG5AR538–919, which encodes a DBD- and LBD-containing fragment of the AR (Fig. 1 C). Expression levels of the VP16 fusion constructs were similar (Fig. 1 D). As expected, the AR1–529 fragment interacts hormone-dependently with AR538–919. The deletion of the FQNLF motif in AR1–529 completely abolished the R1881-dependent interaction. These findings are in agreement with previous reports (40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar, 41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the G21E mutation in the NTD, outside the FQNLF motif, also markedly reduces N/C interaction. In contrast, no difference in the LBD interaction is observed for the AR1–529L435P mutation. Therefore, we suggest that the first amino-terminal amino acids of the AR-NTD form the predominant interaction site for the AR-LBD. The effect of the deletion of the FQNLF motif (hARΔFQNLF) was analyzed in the context of the full size AR on a series of selective and nonselective AREs (Fig.2). When using wild type AR, the induction factors are 16.5, 19.9, and 8.9 for the nonspecific AREs TAT-GRE, slp-HRE3, and C3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)-ARE, respectively, whereas ARΔFQNLF showed a markedly decreased induction of these reporter constructs (6.0, 8.7, and 3.1, respectively). However, forslp-HRE2 and sc-ARE1.2, which are androgen-specific HREs, no difference is seen between the wtAR and the ARΔFQNLF. In contrast, the FQNLF deletion does affect the transactivating abilities of the receptor when tested on the PB-ARE2, which is another known androgen-specific ARE (7Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Google Scholar, 49Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 23-36Google Scholar). Two mutations were introduced within slp-HRE2 (slp-HRE2 mut-4T-A;+2A-T) and in sc-ARE1.2 (sc-ARE1.2 mut-4T-A;−2A-T), changing these elements into nonselective ones and leading to a functional loss of AR specificity (10Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, this loss of specificity correlates with a strong decrease in transactivation by the ARΔFQNLF in comparison with wtAR activity. Although the activity of the ΔFQNLF mutant on the wild type slp-HRE2 and thesc-ARE1.2 does not significantly differ from that of wtAR, androgen-mediated induction factors of the mutated sc andslp response elements are two or three times lower for the ΔFQNLF construct compared with the wild type AR. We tested four luciferase reporter constructs in transient transfections of COS-7 cells (Fig.4). One construct is driven by the probasin proximal promotor (pPB-Luc). The three other constructs are driven by the thymidine kinase minimal promotor and contain either the C3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar) intronic enhancer (pC3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)-TATA-Luc), the slpenhancer (pSLP-TATA-Luc), or the sc enhancer (pSC-TATA-Luc). Three of them (pPB-Luc, pSLP-TATA-Luc, and pSC-TATA-Luc) are controlled by androgen-specific elements, whereas pC3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)-TATA-Luc is activated by all class I steroid receptors (12Claessens F. Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 23-30Google Scholar). In contrast to the isolated elements tested in Figs. 2 and 3, no difference in the effect of the FQNLF deletion is seen between specific and nonspecific enhancers, because for all reporter constructs, the FQNLF deletion reduces the potency of the AR ∼2-fold. The average induction factors are 15.0, 15.6, 35.0, and 49.8 for wtAR and 6.2, 4.6, 19.0, and 17.0 for ARΔFQNLF on pC3 (1Evans R.M. Science. 1988; 240: 889-895Google Scholar)-TATA-Luc, pPB-Luc, pSLP-TATA-Luc, and pSC-TATA-Luc, respectively. The point mutation G21E shows a decreased AR N/C interaction similar to the deletion of the FQNLF core in a mammalian two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 C). We tested whether the transcriptional activity of the full size AR is affected by this mutation when specific or nonspecific AREs are used. Surprisingly, the transcriptional activation of the TAT-GRE construct is decreased only marginally when the G21E mutation is introduced in the AR, and no clear effect is seen when the androgen-selective slp-HRE2 was tested. When the nonselective mutant of slp-HRE2 was used, the G21E mutation again had no effect on the functionality of the AR (Fig.5). To analyze the influence of the deletion of the FQNLF motif and the G21E and the L435P mutations on the in vitro interaction of the full size receptor with nonspecific and specific AREs, band shifts assays using wtAR, ARΔFQNLF, ARG21E, and ARL435P were performed (Fig.6 A). COS-7 cells were transfected with expression vectors for wtAR, ARΔFQNLF, ARG21E, and ARL435P (1 μg). As a specific ARE, we used slp-HRE2, and as nonspecific elements, we used slp-HRE2 mut-4T-A;+2A-T and the TAT-GRE. The gel shift assays showed very similar binding of wtAR and the mutant ARs to different response elements. Western blot analysis of the extracts was performed to assess equal expression levels of the different receptors (Fig. 6 B). The AR-NTD contains a strong ligand-independent activation function in the carboxyl-terminal region of the AR-NTD (Tau-5). To analyze whether the aforementioned mutations influence this constitutively active Tau-5 function, wild type and mutant forms of the AR-NTD domains were fused to the Gal4-DBD and transfected into COS-7 cells. As reporter construct, we used (Gal4)5-TATA-Luc (Fig.7 A). Deletion of FQNLF and the G21E mutation resulted in an activation comparable with that of wtAR-NTD, whereas the L435P mutation resulted in a decreased activation. It has already been proposed that the efficient recruitment of coactivators by the native AR occurs primarily through the NTD (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar,37Oñate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W. J. Biol.

Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49230-49237Google Scholar). SRC-1 is a member of the p160 coactivator family and contains a glutamine-rich region (amino acids 989–1240) called Qr, needed for interaction with the amino-terminal domain of the AR in a ligand-independent manner (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar, 37Oñate S.A. Boonyaratanakornkit V. Spencer T.E. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Edwards D.P. O'Malley B.W.

Callewaert L. Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49230-49237Google Scholar). We tested whether the mutations AR1–529ΔFQNLF, AR1–529G21E, and AR1–529L435P, fused to the VP16 activation domain, are still able to interact with the Qr of SRC-1, fused to the Gal4-DBD (Fig. 7 B). A striking characteristic for the point mutation G21E is that, although the NTD shows a strongly reduced interaction with the AR-LBD (Fig. 1 C), there is a 2.5-fold better interaction with Qr when compared with wtAR-NTD. This is not seen with AR1–529ΔFQNLF or AR1–529L435P (Fig.7 B). To compare the interaction of Qr with AR-NTD and its mutants with the coactivation ability of SRC-1e, the constructs pSG5, pSG5wtAR, pSG5ΔFQNLF, pSG5G21E, and pSG5L435P and the 2×TAT-GRE(E1b) luciferase reporter construct were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells and cotransfected with pGEM-T or pSG5SRC-1e (Fig. 7 C). Transcriptional activity of ARG21E and ARL435P increased to the same level compared with wtAR in the presence of SRC-1e, whereas the net coactivation of ARΔFQNLF in the presence of SRC-1e is lower. For the members of the steroid receptor superfamily such as estrogen receptor α, GR, and progesterone receptor, a ligand-induced conformational change has been clearly demonstrated to result in a hydrophobic recruitment surface (AF-2) for transcriptional coactivators. These coactivators interact with the LBD via three highly conserved α-helical LXXLL signature motifs (35Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). The AR has been reported to be different from the other steroid hormone receptors in that the AF-2 activity in the LBD is quite low when tested in mammalian cells (2Moilanen A. Rouleau N. Ikonen T. Palvimo J.J. Janne O.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 355-358Google Scholar). However, the AR-LBD has the same overall three-dimensional structure as the LBDs of the other nuclear hormone receptors (50Sack J.S. Kish K.F. Wang C. Attar R.M. Kiefer S.E. An Y. Wu G.Y.

The AR-NTD not only harbors a strong activation function (AF-1) (16Jenster G. van der Korput H.A. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7341-7346Google Scholar) but also displays a high affinity for the liganded LBD (18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar, 40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar, 41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R.

Steketee K. Trapman J. Brinkmann A.O. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1172-1183Google Scholar). LXXLL-related sequences in the AR-NTD have been investigated for their interaction with the LBD. We already reported the involvement of one LXXLL-like motif, 179LKDIL183(18Alen P. Claessens F. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Peeters B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6085-6097Google Scholar), the mutation of which (I182A/L183A) impairs the N/C interaction and the activity of the AR. Two other candidate motives have been described: 23FQNLF27 and432WHTLF436 (40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar, 41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Google Scholar). In this study, we performed a functional analysis of these latter motifs. Deleting the FQNLF motif destroys the ability of the AR-NTD to interact with the AR-LBD. The mutation of Gly21 flanking the FQNLF core to Glu strongly attenuates the N/C interaction. In contrast to another report (40He B. Kemppainen J.A. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22986-22994Google Scholar), LBD binding by the L435P mutated NTD is comparable with that observed for the wtAR-NTD (Fig. 1 C). To investigate the role of the N/C interaction in AR functionality in more detail, we analyzed the activity of the mutated receptors on different responsive constructs. Next to the classical nonselective class I elements, there is an additional group of AREs that are only recognized by the AR. Examples of such androgen-specific elements are the PB-ARE2 from the rat probasin promotor (7Claessens F. Alen P. Devos A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19013-19016Google Scholar, 49Rennie P.S. Bruchovsky N. Leco K.J. Sheppard P.C. McQueen S.A. Cheng H. Snoek R. Hamel A. Bock M.E. MacDonald B.S. Mol.

Claessens F. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 611-620Google Scholar, 52Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 153: 91-102Google Scholar), the sc-ARE1.2 in the far upstream enhancer of the human SC gene (8Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Haelens A. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1558-1570Google Scholar, 10Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Google Scholar), the slp-HRE2 from the upstream enhancer of the mouse sex-limited protein (53Adler A.J. Scheller A. Hoffman Y. Robins D.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1587-1596Google Scholar), and the Pem ARE-1 and ARE-2 in the proximal promotor of the murine pem gene (54Barbulescu K. Geserick C. Schuttke I. Schleuning W.D. Haendler B. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 1803-1816Google Scholar). Elsewhere, we hypothesized that an alternative dimerization mechanism of the DNA-binding domain would be responsible for the androgen specificity (11Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Google Scholar). We demonstrated indeed that the AR is the only steroid receptor which binds direct repeats of 5′-TGTTCT-3′-like sequences (9Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Google Scholar, 10Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12298-12305Google Scholar, 11Schoenmakers E. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12290-12297Google Scholar, 13Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Callewaert L. Peeters B. Rombauts W. Claessens F. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 611-620Google Scholar), indicating that the AR could bind the specific elements in a head-to-tail configuration and not in the conventional head-to-head configuration. In this study, we compared the transcriptional activity of the constructs ARΔFQNLF, ARG21E, and ARL435P on specific versus nonspecific response elements and enhancers (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). For the mutation L435P in the WHTLF motif and the mutation I182A/L183A in the LKDIL motif, no difference on selectiveversus nonselective elements was seen. In fact, the L435P mutation did not affect the transcriptional activation by any of the tested motifs (data not shown). We observed a decrease in the transcription activating capacity of ARΔFQNLF compared with wtAR on nonspecific HREs, whereas no changes were observed on the specific slp-HRE2 andsc-ARE1.2 elements. However, when these AREs are mutated in their left and/or right half-sites (slp-HRE2 mut-4T-A;+2A-T and sc-ARE1.2 mut-4T-A;−2A-T) to become partial palindromic repeats, AR transactivation was significantly affected by the FQNLF deletion. A possible explanation for why no decrease in AR transcriptional activity is observed on the two specific AREs is that AR dimers, in which the DBD is dimerized in a head-to-tail conformation, might be less dependent on the N/C interaction for transactivation. Whether other factors or cofactors play a role in these differences remains to be elucidated. Nonspecific HREs seem to be more dependent on the N/C interaction compared with the direct repeat AREs (Figs. 2 and 3). One exception is the AR-specific PB-ARE2, although this might be explained by the fact that PB-ARE2 (5′-GGTTCTnnnAGTACT-3′) can be considered as a direct as well as a palindromic repeat. It is clear from Fig. 6 A that there are no obvious differences between the wild type and the mutant receptors in their binding characteristics for the different DNA elements. The G21E mutation strongly reduces N/C interaction (Fig.1 C). It is therefore clear that not only the core FQNLF motif but also some flanking residues contribute. This correlates with the stronger conservation of this region among the AR of different species (Fig. 1 B) (41Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Dubbink H.J. Doesburg P. Hersmus R. Brinkmann A.O. Trapman J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5780-5791Google Scholar, 55Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the differences seen on AR transcriptional activity at specific versusnonspecific elements by the deletion of FQNLF were not observed with this point mutation. This might be explained by the residual AR-NTDG21E/AR-LBD interaction, observed in Fig.1 C, which could be sufficient for AR activity on the nonspecific HREs. The differences we observed for ARΔFQNLF transcriptional activity at specific versus nonspecific elements are limited to isolated response elements because no effect is seen on specific and nonspecific enhancers. This could be due to the fact that hormone response elements form part of more complex enhancers, whose activity is also tightly controlled by additional transcription factors (12Claessens F. Verrijdt G. Schoenmakers E. Haelens A. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 76: 23-30Google Scholar). The slpenhancer, for example, contains three HREs: HRE-1, HRE-2, and HRE-3, and other transcription factors binding to the slp-ARU were identified as NFκB, octamer transcription factor, and AML3/CBFα1 (56Scarlett C.O. Scheller A. Thompson E. Robins D.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 45-57Google Scholar). A second interesting feature for the G21E mutation is an almost 3-fold increase in the affinity for the Qr of SRC-1 as measured in double-hybrid assays (Fig. 7 B). This increase in Qr binding is not seen for the AR-NTDΔFQNLF nor for the L435P mutated AR-NTD. It should be noted that deletion of the FQNLF core and the G21E mutation does not affect the intrinsic activity of the NTD, in contrast to L435P mutation, which reduces the activity 2-fold (Fig. 1 C). Possibly, the lowered affinity of the NTDG21E for the LBD and its effect on transactivation by the AR is compensated by the increased affinity of the NTD for the Qr of SRC-1. SRC-1e coexpression seems to rescue the ARG21E activity to the same level as wtAR and ARL435P (Fig.7 C). Our data do not exclude the possibility of a stabilization by the NTD of the conformation of the LBD, which would lead to an enhanced recruitment of coactivators as postulated earlier (57He B. Kemppainen J.A. Voegel J.J. Gronemeyer H. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37219-37225Google Scholar). However, the effects of the G21E mutation on Qr recruitment by the isolated NTD (Fig. 7 B) leads us to propose a more direct role in the p160 recruitment. In summary, our findings demonstrate a dual role of the first amino acids of the amino-terminal domain of the AR, which are essential for the N/C interaction and which seem to have an additional function in interaction with Qr of SRC-1. These results contribute to the unraveling of the mechanisms involved in the AR-N/C interactions and the mechanisms of SRC-1 recruitment. Recently, it has been described that the relative contribution of the two interaction sites of SRC-1 with the AR, the LXXLL motifs and the Qr region, depend on the nature of the enhancers (39Christiaens V. Bevan C.L. Callewaert L. Haelens A. Verrijdt G. Rombauts W. Claessens F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49230-49237Google Scholar). In addition, we provide the first indication that transactivation by the AR through some selective AREs (slp-HRE2 and sc-ARE1.2) is structurally different from transactivation through other classical AREs. We thank R. Bollen, H. Debruyn, and K. Bosmans for excellent technical assistance. We are indebted to A. O. Brinkmann and M. G. Parker for providing several plasmids."

T., Batova, I. N., Widgren, E. E., Zheng, L. X., Whitfield, M., Marzluff, W. F., and O'Rand, M. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 30378–30386). When full-length tNASP fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) is transiently transfected into HeLa cells, it is efficiently transported into the nucleus within 2 h after translation in the cytoplasm, whereas the NASP nuclear localization signal (NLS) deletion mutant (NASP-ΔNLS-GFP) is retained in the cytoplasm. In HeLa cells synchronized by a double thymidine block and transiently transfected to overexpress full-length tNASP or NASP-ΔNLS, progression through the G1/S border is delayed. Cells transiently transfected to overexpress the histone-binding site (HBS) deletion mutant (NASP-ΔHBS) or sNASP were not delayed in progression through the G1/S border. By using a DNA supercoiling assay, in vitro binding data demonstrate that H1 histone-tNASP complexes can transfer H1 histones to DNA, whereas NASP-ΔHBS cannot. Measurement of NASP mobility in the nucleus by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates that NASP mobility is virtually identical to that reported for H1 histones. These data suggest that NASP-H1 complexes exist in the nucleus and that tNASP can influence cell cycle progression through the G1/S border through mediation of DNA-H1 histone binding. NASP is an H1 histone-binding protein that is cell cycle-regulated and occurs in two major forms: tNASP, found in gametes, embryonic cells, and transformed cells; and sNASP, found in all rapidly dividing somatic cells (Richardson, R.

Moreover, H1 histones have been shown to influence G1/S phase progression (5Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Google Scholar) and in some cases inhibit transcription initiation (6Cheung E. Zarifyan A.S. Kraus W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2463-2471Google Scholar). Consequently, understanding the role of H1 histones is important for our understanding of both gene activation and chromatin organization (7Karetsou Z. Sandaltzopoulos R. Frangou-Lazaridis M.

Reprod. 1996; 54: 1238-1244Google Scholar). NASP occurs in two major forms as follows: tNASP, found in gametes, embryonic cells, and transformed cells; and sNASP, found in all dividing somatic cells (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). Mouse sNASP (M r45,751) is identical to tNASP (M r 83,934), except that it lacks two internal regions of the protein (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F.

Similarly human tNASP and sNASP occur with identical deletions to those found in the mouse (10Richardson R.T. Bencic D.C. O'Rand M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 274: 67-75Google Scholar, 13O'Rand M.G. Richardson R.T. Zimmerman L.J. Widgren E.E. Dev. Biol. 1992; 154: 37-44Google Scholar). During the cell cycle, NASP mRNA expression in somatic cells increases and decreases concurrently with histone mRNA changes in expression (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). However, in rapidly dividing cells protein levels of NASP remain fairly constant and only decrease to undetectable levels in non-dividing cells (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). Reports that overexpression of H1 histones can influence progression through the cell cycle (5Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the effect on progression through the cell cycle by overexpression of NASP and to examine the relationship of NASP to H1 histones in HeLa cells. In this report we demonstrate that 1) the overexpression of tNASP does influence progression through the cycle, 2) tNASP is bound to H1 histones in HeLa cells, 3)in vitro complexes of tNASP-H1 will transfer H1 to DNA, and 4) that NASP and H1 have virtually identical mobilities within the nucleus. All chemicals and reagents used in this study were molecular biology grade. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Purification of plasmid DNA and PCR products were carried out using QIAprep Miniprep and QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and sequencing was performed at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, automated sequencing facility. Affinity-purified goat anti-green fluorescent protein antiserum was purchased from Rockland (Gilbertsville, Pa); rabbit anti-histone H1 (FL-219) polyclonal antiserum was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and rabbit anti-NASP antiserum was prepared against either N-terminal (nucleotides 96–1099) or C-terminal (nucleotides 1100–2414) recombinant proteins as described previously (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). The entire coding sequence of mouse tNASP (nucleotides 92–2405, GenBankTMaccession number AF034610) was amplified from mouse testis Quick-clone cDNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and cloned into a KpnI/BamHI site in the pEGFP-N1 vector, which contains the sequence for expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP1; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The nuclear localization signal (NLS) deletion mutant (NASP-ΔNLS; nucleotides 92–2192), which lacked the nuclear localization signal (nucleotides 2215–2268), was PCR-amplified and cloned into the same pEGFP-N1 vector. The entire coding region of mouse sNASP (nucleotides 254–1384, GenBankTM accession number AF095722) (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar) was also cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector. The histone-binding site deletion mutant (NASP-ΔHBS; nucleotides 527–1384), which lacked all histone-binding sites (nucleotides 349–523) (11O'Rand M.G. Batova I. Richardson R.T. Goldberg E. The Testis, From Stem Cell to Sperm Function. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2000: 43-150Google Scholar), was PCR-amplified and cloned into pEGFP-N1. For cell cycle studies, vectors lacking the GFP sequence were constructed from pEGFP-N1 by excising the GFP by sequential digest byBamHI and NotI. Digested ends were repaired by Klenow enzyme and ligated by T4 DNA ligase. All constructs were sequenced to verify the correct reading frame. For in vitro H1-binding studies, full-length tNASP and NASP-ΔHBS (amino acids 567–773) were cloned into His6tag-pQE30 vectors. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS-competent Escherichia coli cells and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H plus 10% calf serum. Cells were removed from plastic dishes by trypsinization in EDTA. Synchronized populations of HeLa cells were obtained by double thymidine blocking as described previously (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). HeLa cells were grown on chamber slides with polystyrene wells (Falcon® CultureSlide, BD Biosciences), washed twice with cold (4 °C) PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0), fixed with chilled (−20 °C) methanol (20 min), washed twice with cold PBS, and incubated in rabbit anti-NASP (N-terminal) antiserum or preimmune serum (1:500) in PBS. Cells were incubated for 45 min, washed in PBS (3×, 5 min each), and incubated in fluorescein-conjugated, affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG Fc fragment (1:1000 in PBS; Cappel, West Chester, PA) for 30 min. Washed cells were viewed with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. Plasmid-DNA complexes were transiently transfected into HeLa cells using Effectene Transfection Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). This method is based on a non-liposomal lipid formulation and resulted in low cytotoxicity and high transfection efficiency (∼97%) as determined by FACS analysis. Cells were transfected for 4–6 h with tNASP-GFP, NASP-ΔNLS-GFP, or GFP only. Transfection was confirmed by Western blotting. Lysates from HeLa cells transfected with tNASP-GFP or NASP-ΔNLS-GFP were separated by SDS-PAGE, Western-blotted (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar), and stained with rabbit anti-NASP antibodies and affinity-purified goat anti-green fluorescent protein polyclonal antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Control cells and transfected cells 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after release from the double thymidine block were washed with PBS, trypsinized, and fixed with 70% ethanol for ≥2 h on ice. Cells were washed in PBS, stained (30 min at 37 °C) with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide in PBS (containing 200 μg/ml RNase A and 0.1% Triton X-100), and incubated overnight at 4 °C before analysis at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Flow Cytometry Facility. For each sample at least 10,000 cells were counted. After gating out doublets and debris, cell cycle distribution was analyzed using Summit version 3.1 software (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). For each time point, at least three different samples were examined. Affinity chromatography was carried out with rabbit anti-NASP (C-terminal) antibodies (30 mg) coupled to Reacti-Gel 6× beads (Pierce; coupling efficiency >80%). HeLa cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and solubilized by incubation in lysis buffer: 0.01 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 0.15 m NaCl, containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Following centrifugation (10 min, 6000 ×g), the pellet was sonicated, added to the supernatant, and centrifuged again (10 min, 6000 × g). The supernatant was collected and incubated with antibody-coupled beads overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the bound proteins were eluted from the beads with ImmunoPure® Elution Buffer (Pierce). The eluate pH was neutralized, and the sample was concentrated by vacuum centrifugation. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% Tris-Cl Criterion gradient minigels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions, blotted to Immobilon-P (Millipore Inc., Bedford, MA), and probed for NASP and H1 histones. A C-18 reverse phase HPLC column (Waters, DeltaPak, 15 μm, 300 Å, 3.9 × 300 mm) equilibrated with acetonitrile (ACN) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used for the identification of histone H1 subtypes as described previously (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were eluted at 28 °C with a multistep ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gradient (0.7 ml/min). Gradients were developed from 18.5 to 100% buffer B (90% ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and 81.5 to 0% buffer A (10% ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). To assess the ability of H1-NASP complexes to transfer H1 to DNA, H1-NASP complexes were prepared in vitro and analyzed by a DNA supercoiling assay modified from the method of Kleinschmidt et al. (14Kleinschmidt J.A. Fortkamp E. Krohne G. Zentgraf H. Franke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1166-1176Google Scholar). Calf thymus H1 histones (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were biotinylated using an EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-biotin kit (Pierce). Biotinylated H1 histones (1 μg) and tNASP (3 μg) were incubated (30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 1 mm ATP) and chromatographed in 1× SSC buffer, pH 7.4, on Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) to remove unbound H1 histones, which are retained by the column. Samples were evaluated by SDS-PAGE (10–20% Tris-HCl Criterion gels, Bio-Rad) and Western blotting to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Biotinylated H1 histones were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated avidin, and tNASP was detected using anti-NASP antibodies (N-terminal) and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody (Cappel, West Chester, PA). Supercoiled SV40 DNA (Invitrogen) was relaxed by incubation with topoisomerase I (Invitrogen). H1 histones, tNASP, or H1-NASP complexes from the Micro Bio-Spin 30 chromatography columns (described above) were incubated with the relaxed SV40 DNA for 30 min at 37 °C in TOPO buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1.0 mm ATP, pH 7.5, with 30 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). The reactions were terminated by the addition of a Sarkosyl-proteinase K (2% and 0.3 mg/ml final concentration, respectively) mixture, which was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. The DNA was subsequently phenol-chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis in 4× TAE and ethidium bromide-stained for visualization. HeLa cells growing on coverslips (25–30% confluent) were transfected by pEGFPN1-NASP as described above. Cells were observed 24 h after transfection. Coverslips with cells were mounted in metal chambers and observed with a ×40 objective in a Zeiss 410 confocal microscope using the 488-nm laser line of an argon-krypton laser. In a FRAP experiment one scan of the unbleached cell was acquired, followed by a single bleach pulse of 5–10 s using a spot of rectangular shape and differing in size depending upon the size of the bleached structure (usually 50 or 100% of the nuclear area). Images were collected from the same section initially at 5- or 10-s intervals (1 min) followed by 30-s intervals for 4 min. For imaging, the laser power was attenuated to 0.3% of the bleach intensity. FRAP recovery curves were obtained from background-subtracted images using GelExpert Software (Nucleotech Corp., San Carlos, CA). The relative fluorescence in the nuclear area measured was determined as defined by Phair and Misteli (16Phair R. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Google Scholar). The relative fluorescence is I rel =T 0 I t/T t I 0, where T 0 is the total nuclear fluorescence intensity before bleaching, and I 0 is the fluorescence intensity of the nuclear area to be bleached.T t and I t are the fluorescence intensities at time t. Approximately 1% of the fluorescence was lost during imaging. Indirect immunofluorescent staining of unsynchronized HeLa cells as well as synchronized cells 2, 4, 6, and 8 h after being released from the double thymidine block demonstrated that immediately after mitosis and continuing throughout S and G2 phases NASP is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). In the nucleus NASP is unevenly distributed and appears to be excluded from nucleolar regions. In the cytoplasm NASP is most abundant in dense aggregations in the perinuclear regions but often can be seen as rows of aggregates reaching the peripheral cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A). Transfection of cells with tNASP-GFP resulted in strong nuclear staining (Fig. 1 B) 2 h after transfection (97% of the cells were transfected after 24 h). Cytoplasmic staining remained weaker than the nuclear staining throughout the 24 h of observation. Transfection of cells with NASP-ΔNLS-GFP resulted in strong cytoplasmic staining, particularly in the perinuclear region, with no detectable stain in the nucleus (Fig. 1 C). Control transfection with GFP only resulted in staining in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 1 D). Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting of transfected cells with anti-NASP and anti-GFP antiserum confirmed the expression of the constructs in these cells (Fig.2 A). Western blots of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from non-transfected HeLa cells confirmed the presence of both s and t forms of NASP in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2 B). In myeloma 66-2 cells H1 histones were found to co-purify bound to native NASP (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). Similarly in HeLa cells, isolation of NASP by HPLC size chromatography or affinity chromatography with anti-NASP antibodies resulted in the co-purification of H1 histones (Fig. 2, C and D). Histone analysis by reverse phase HPLC of H1 histones extracted from H1-NASP complexes identified subtype H1d/e (H1.2) as the H1 histone (data not shown). Histone H1.2 is the most abundant subtype in HeLa cells (15Kratzmeier M. Albig W. Meergans T. Doenecke D. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 319-327Google Scholar); however, other histone H1 subtypes may not have been detected because of limited amounts of sample. In experiments overexpressing NASP and NASP deletion mutants in synchronized HeLa cells, we used constructs without the GFP sequence. Chemical transfection of cells with the vectors expressing NASP and NASP deletion mutants was done 24 h before the cells were released from the double thymidine block to ensure complete expression of the construct. Fig. 3 shows a typical experiment in which cell cycle progression is analyzed by FACS analysis up to 8 h after release from the double thymidine block. Overexpression of tNASP clearly affects the progression of cells through the cell cycle; compare Fig. 3, A and B. Similarly overexpression of NASP-ΔNLS affects the progression of cells through the cell cycle; compare Fig. 3, A andC. Fig. 3, D and E, shows that cells transfected with NASP-ΔHBS, the mutant lacking histone-binding sites, or sNASP do not delay progression through the cell cycle. Table I presents the data collected from 6 independent experiments at 4 and 6 h after release from the double thymidine block. At 4 and 6 h after release there were significantly fewer HeLa cells, which were overexpressing tNASP, in the G2 and S phases than there were non-overexpressing HeLa cells (71.45 versus 50.8%; p = 0.01 at 4 h, and 79.85 versus 60%; p = 0.01 at 6 h; Fig. 4 and Table I). Similarly there were significantly fewer overexpressing tNASP-ΔNLS HeLa cells than non-overexpressing cells in the G2 and S phases (71.45versus 53.17%; p < 0.01 at 4 h, and 79.85 versus 59.27%; p = 0.01 at 6 h; Fig. 4 and Table I). There was, however, no significant difference between tNASP and NASP-ΔNLS (Fig. 4). Data from 2, 8, and 24 h showed no significant differences between any of the cells tested. There was no difference in the progression of cells through the cell cycle between untreated cells and cells treated with delivery reagents only (Table I). At 4 and 6 h, cells transfected with NASP-ΔHBS (p = 0.37 (4 h) and p = 0.48 (6 h)) or sNASP (p = 0.34 (4 h) and p = 0.34 (6 h)) did not significantly delay progression through the cell cycle (Fig. 3, D and E; Table I). These data indicate that the overexpression of tNASP is different from the overexpression of sNASP in its effect on cell cycle progression and that the histone-binding sites are necessary for the delay in cell cycle progression. However, the presence of a NLS is not required for this effect.Table IPercent of cells in S+G2 phase4 hNormaltNASP full-lengthNLS-mutantHBS-mutantsNASP full-lengthDelivery reagentp valueExp. 160.7042.9049.30Exp. 262.9052.2052.80Exp. 371.3057.3057.40Exp. 486.7088.1073.60Exp. 570.1053.1046.40Exp. 677.0086.9079.4079.30Mean71.4550.8053.1776.0366.47S.D.9.537.304.0619.8717.62ttest, N vs.tN0.01p = 0.01t test, N vs.NLS-0.003p < 0.01t test, N vs.HBS-0.37NSt test, Nvs. sN0.34NS6 hNormaltNASP full-lengthNLS-mutantHBS-mutantsNASP full-lengthDelivery reagentp valueExp. 172.9051.2050.10Exp. 271.6061.5063.70Exp. 378.8067.3064.00Exp. 488.5088.6081.00Exp. 578.5061.3056.40Exp. 688.8087.9088.0088.80Mean79.8560.0059.2779.2775.13S.D.7.418.157.9415.5616.60ttest, N vs.tN0.01p = 0.01t test, N vs.NLS-0.01p = 0.01t test, N vs.HBS-0.48NSt test, Nvs. sN0.34NSThe abbreviations used are as follows: N, normal HeLa cells; tN, full-length tNASP sequence; NLS-, NASP-ΔNLS; HBS-, NASP-ΔHBS; sN, full-length sNASP; t test = Student's ttest; NS, not significant.

To test the ability of NASP to transfer H1 histones to DNA, calf thymus H1 histones were biotinylated and bound to tNASP in vitro, and the H1-NASP complexes were subsequently separated by chromatography on Bio-Rad Micro Bio-Spin 30 (MBS30) columns. MBS30 columns separate H1-NASP complexes from unbound histones. Fig. 5demonstrates that biotinylated H1 histones are retained on the MBS30 column (lanes 1 and 2); however, when H1 is complexed with NASP, both are eluted from the column (lanes 4 and 6). When NASP-ΔHBS is substituted for tNASP, it elutes from the column (lane 5) but does not bind H1 histones and does not non-specifically carry H1 histones through the column (lane 3). The separated H1-NASP complexes were incubated with relaxed SV40 DNA to test the ability of H1 histones to supercoil the SV40 DNA (Fig.6). Supercoiled and relaxed SV40 DNA are shown in Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2. The addition of H1 histones to relaxed SV40 DNA causes supercoiling (lane 3), whereas the addition of tNASP does not (lane 4). As shown in Fig. 6, lanes 6 and 7, the addition of H1-NASP complexes, which have passed through the MBS30 column, to relaxed SV40 DNA results in supercoiling the DNA. If H1 only is chromatographed and the resulting eluate incubated with relaxed SV40 DNA, no supercoiling occurs because the H1 histones are retained by the column (lane 5). If increasing amounts of tNASP are added at the time of the addition of H1-NASP complexes to relaxed SV40 DNA, then there is a reduction in the intensity of the supercoiled DNA bands (Fig. 7). This indicates that tNASP competes with DNA for H1 binding.Figure 7Competition of DNA and tNASP for H1. Lane 1, relaxed SV40 DNA, supercoiled SV40 DNA relaxed with topoisomerase I.

If NASP-H1 complexes were present in the nucleus, then we would expect that the mobility properties of NASP would be similar to those of H1. Consequently, we used FRAP to determine the time necessary for NASP to move into a bleached area of the nucleus. Bleaching ∼50% of a nucleus containing tNASP-GFP (see also Fig. 1 B) resulted in a recovery of fluorescence to a plateau level of 92.5 ± 4.6% in 220–225 s (n = 3 experiments). Fig. 8 shows a typical experiment in which 50% of the nucleus was bleached (Fig.8 A), and the fluorescence recovery was 96.5 ± 1.2% in 225 s (Fig. 8 B). This compares favorably to the 200–250 s necessary for recovery of H1-GFP fluorescence in the nucleus (4Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar). As fluorescence intensity increases in the bleached area, there is a concomitant decrease in intensity in the unbleached area (Fig.8 A), indicating that NASP is redistributed within the nucleus. Because HeLa cells transfected with tNASP-GFP have very little tNASP-GFP in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B), photobleaching the entire nucleus resulted in no recovery of fluorescence in 300 s (n = 3 experiments), indicating that essentially no tNASP-GFP entered the nucleus from the cytoplasm in these experiments. In this study we have demonstrated that the H1 histone-binding protein NASP is present in the nucleus and cytoplasm of HeLa cells and can be directed to the nucleus by its NLS (Fig. 1). Even though transfection of cells with tNASP-GFP resulted in almost complete nuclear localization of the construct, endogenous NASP is clearly not exclusively in the nucleus (Figs. 1 and 2). From Western blotting (Fig.2) it would appear that there is less tNASP in the nucleus than in the cytoplasm, whereas sNASP is more evenly distributed between the two compartments. Because tNASP occurs in rapidly dividing cell populations (gametes, embryonic cells, and transformed cells), its presence in the cytoplasm may serve as a storage site for excess linker (H1) histones. Alternatively, the majority of NASP in the cytoplasm could simply reflect a lagging degradation mechanism in rapidly dividing cells because in normal somatic cells there is little or no NASP in the cytoplasm (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar). Overexpression of tNASP significantly delays the progression of cells through the cell cycle, and surprisingly, overexpression of NASP-ΔNLS also significantly delays progression through the cell cycle (Fig. 3and Table I). However, overexpression of sNASP does not appear to have a significant effect. The most obvious difference between tNASP (M r 83,934) and sNASP (M r45,751) is the presence of an additional histone-binding site (1Richardson R.T. Batova I.N. Widgren E.E. Zheng L.X. Whitfield M. Marzluff W.F. O'Rand M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30378-30386Google Scholar, 11O'Rand M.G. Batova I. Richardson R.T. Goldberg E. The Testis, From Stem Cell to Sperm Function. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York2000: 43-150Google Scholar). The identical C-terminal sequences of tNASP and sNASP contain a leucine zipper flanked by coiled coil regions downstream and possible DNA-binding sites upstream; these structural features are often indicative of protein dimers that bind DNA (17Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Google Scholar). If tNASP dimers form in the cytoplasm and bind H1 histones, then the overexpression of tNASP may result in insufficient linker histones for DNA replication. The only other notable difference between tNASP and sNASP is the presence of two additional ATP/GTP-binding sites in tNASP. These sites may be important for the functional attributes of tNASP and its role in chromatin remodeling. Additionally, this study has demonstrated in vitro that H1-NASP complexes can cause the supercoiling of relaxed SV40 DNA by transferring H1 from NASP to DNA and importantly that excess tNASP can compete with DNA for H1. Kleinschmidt et al. (14Kleinschmidt J.A. Fortkamp E. Krohne G. Zentgraf H. Franke W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1166-1176Google Scholar) first demonstrated the transfer of histone to DNA from the Xenopus laevis form of NASP (N1/N2). Consequently, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that an equilibrium exists between NASP-H1 histone complexes and H1 histones bound to DNA. This equilibrium influences the availability of H1 histones to DNA and affects the progression of the cell through the G1/S phase transition. It can be upset by overexpression of tNASP with its extra histone-binding site and is consistent with the observation that H1 histone overexpression has been shown to slow G1/S phase progression (5Brown D.T. Alexander B.T. Sittman D.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 486-493Google Scholar) and in some cases inhibit transcription initiation (6Cheung E. Zarifyan A.S. Kraus W.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2463-2471Google Scholar). Recent reports of the mobility of H1 histones in the nucleus (3Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P.H. Sun X.J. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Google Scholar, 4Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar) concluded that an intermediate (4Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar) or modulating protein (3Lever M.A. Th'ng J.P.H. Sun X.J. Hendzel M.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 873-876Google Scholar) might be present to regulate the movement of H1. By using FRAP experiments on HeLa cells, this study has demonstrated that the mobility of NASP in the nucleus is essentially the same as that of H1 histones (Fig. 8). Although it could be fortuitous that the recovery times are similar, one interpretation of this result is that NASP and H1 have identical mobility characteristics because they are in a complex together in the nucleus. This interpretation is supported by the results from the co-precipitation experiments (Fig. 2). The recovery times of NASP and H1 (∼225 s) differ markedly from other nuclear proteins. For example, GFP-HMG-17 and GFP-SF2/ASF have recovery times on the order of 30 s, whereas histone H2B has no recovery over 90 s (16Phair R. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Google Scholar). The less mobile (immobile) fraction determined in a FRAP experiment is a reflection of the residence time of the molecule in a compartment or complex and can be modified by various treatments such as acetylation (4Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar). Small immobile fractions (∼10%, e.g. GFP-SF2/ASF (16Phair R. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Google Scholar)) indicate that most of the molecules are replaced within the measured time, while large immobile fractions indicate that very few of the molecules are replaced. Histone H2B would appear to be replaced in the nucleosome very infrequently (16Phair R. Misteli T. Nature. 2000; 404: 604-609Google Scholar), whereas H1 histones are replaced every 200–250 s (4Misteli T. Gunjan A. Hock R. Bustin M. Brown D.T. Nature. 2000; 408: 877-881Google Scholar). The immobile fractions of NASP and H1 vary (∼3.5% NASP versus ∼9–26% for H1), but their recovery times (∼225 s) are similar, which may indicate populations of H1 and NASP that are not complexed with each other or are in different phosphorylation or acetylation states. Phosphorylation of linker histones is known to inhibit chromatin remodeling (2Horn P.J. Carruthers L.M. Logie C. Hill D.A. Solomon M.J. Wade P.A. Imbalzano A.N. Hansen J.C. Peterson C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 263-267Google Scholar, 18Peterson C.L. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 319-322Google Scholar), and NASP may serve to mediate such interactions. Taken together, the results presented in this study indicate that NASP is most likely the H1-regulating protein in the nucleus and that a dynamic equilibrium exists between NASP-H1 complexes and DNA. We thank Drs. J. Gordon and B. Muller-Borer for help and expertise with the FRAP experiments."

To determine whether PtdSer biosynthesis and externalization are altered by PLSCR activities during apoptosis, Chinese hamster ovary K1 cell lines stably overexpressing PLSCR1 and PLSCR2 were established. PLSCR1 was localized on the plasma membrane, whereas PLSCR2 was predominantly in the nucleus. Cells overexpressing PLSCR1 showed suppressed growth, altered cell morphology, and higher basal levels of cell death. Following UV irradiation, these cells showed earlier and enhanced PtdSer exposure, increased caspase-3 activation, apoptotic nuclear changes, and PARP cleavage indicative of apoptosis. UV irradiation in cells overexpressing PLSCR1 led to a 4-fold stimulation of PtdSer synthesis (accompanied by increased movement of newly made PtdSer into microvesicles) relative to untreated PLSCR1 cells, whereas PtdSer formation in UV-irradiated vector control cells increased only by 2-fold. No differences in these responses were observed between PLSCR2-expressing cells and vector controls. PtdSer synthesis and its transbilayer movement stimulated by PLSCR1 overexpression were blocked by a caspase inhibitor along with progression of apoptosis. Thus, our studies showed that overexpression of PLSCR1 in Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells stimulated caspase-dependent PtdSer externalization and synthesis, implying an up-regulation of PtdSer formation in response to enhanced outward movement of this phospholipid to the cell surface during apoptosis. PLSCR1 also appears to influence progression of UV-induced apoptosis and could be a point of regulation or intervention during programmed cell death.

This membrane lipid rearrangement may have various roles depending on the cell type and conditions for mobilization of PtdSer (4Zwaal R.F. Schroit A.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1121-1132Google Scholar). When exposed on the cell surface during programmed cell death, PtdSer signals the removal of apoptotic cells to avoid inflammatory reactions (5Fadok V.A. Voelker D.R. Campbell P.A. Cohen J.J.

Phospholipid scrambling also leads to inward movement of sphingomyelin (SM), where it may be hydrolyzed by neutral sphingomyelinase; subsequent production of ceramide may play an important role in membrane blebbing during apoptosis (7Tepper A.D.

Mechanisms underlying PtdSer externalization are unclear, but concomitant inactivation of aminophospholipid translocase activity and activation of phospholipid scramblase (PLSCR) as a result of rising concentrations of cytoplasmic calcium are considered to play a major role (8Bevers E.M.

Aminophospholipid translocase helps to maintain membrane asymmetry by moving PtdSer and PtdEtn on the outer leaflet back to the inner membrane bilayer (11Seigneuret M. Devaux P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

A family of phospholipid scramblases, including HuPLSCR 1–4 and their murine orthologs, MuPLSCR 1–4, as well as a rat PLSCR homolog to HuPLSCR1, has been identified (17Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Google Scholar, 18Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E. Moussu H. Monteiro R.C. Benhamou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20407-20412Google Scholar). PLSCR proteins have a short extracellular domain or no extracellular domain, whereas their intracellular domains are highly variable in length and composition (18Pastorelli C. Veiga J. Charles N. Voignier E. Moussu H. Monteiro R.C. Benhamou M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20407-20412Google Scholar). Expression of PLSCR1 is induced at the transcriptional level by interferon, indicating its potential involvement in interferon-mediated activities (19Zhou Q. Zhao J. Al Zoghaibi F. Zhou A. Wiedmer T. Silverman R.H. Sims P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 2593-2599Google Scholar, 20Silverman R.H. Halloum A. Zhou A. Dong B. Al Zoghaibi F. Kushner D. Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 397-402Google Scholar). The PLSCRs are type II transmembrane proteins that are highly conserved in the calcium-binding C-terminal domain (21Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2356-2360Google Scholar). Calcium binding to the proteins is presumed to induce a major conformational change and activate the lipid scrambling activity (22Stout J.G. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14860-14866Google Scholar). Some members contain PXXP and PPXY motifs, indicating potential interaction with signaling molecules that contain SH3 or WW domains (17Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Google Scholar, 23Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 266-275Google Scholar). PLSCR1 binds to the SH3 domain of c-Ab1 tyrosine kinase and is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated by this enzyme (24Sun J. Zhao J. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Google Scholar). PLSCR1 is also found to be enriched in lipid rafts and phosphorylated upon its interaction with epidermal growth factor receptor (25Sun J. Nanjundan M. Pike L.J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6338-6345Google Scholar). Other post-translational modifications of PLSCR implicated in regulating its normal functions include palmitoylation at multiple cysteine residues (26Zhao J. Zhou Q. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6361-6366Google Scholar) and phosphorylation at one threonine site through protein kinase Cδ (27Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Google Scholar). PLSCR proteins not only serve to activate membrane lipid scrambling but also play versatile roles in signaling pathways that regulate cellular events such as proliferation and oncogenic transformation (20Silverman R.H. Halloum A. Zhou A. Dong B. Al Zoghaibi F. Kushner D. Zhou Q. Zhao J. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 397-402Google Scholar, 24Sun J. Zhao J. Schwartz M.A. Wang J.Y. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28984-28990Google Scholar). Our previous study using U937 cells showed that PtdSer biosynthesis increased markedly along with the exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface during apoptosis induced by various stimuli. Compared with other newly synthesized phospholipids, PtdSer moved preferentially into microvesicles budding from apoptotic cells. This stimulation of synthesis is regulated in a caspase-dependent manner (28Yu A. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. McMaster C.R. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 296-308Google Scholar). Normally, PtdSer synthesis occurs at the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria-associated membranes through base exchange ofl-serine with the head group of other existing phospholipids (29Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7248-7256Google Scholar), catalyzed by two isoforms of PtdSer synthase (PSS) with different substrate specificities. PSS I utilizes phosphatidylcholine, whereas PSS II converts PtdEtn to PtdSer (30Kuge O. Nishijima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 151-156Google Scholar). Newly synthesized PtdSer is then rapidly transported to other membranes including the plasma membrane. PtdSer also is delivered to mitochondria where it can be decarboxylated to form PtdEtn. Regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis and its movement in mammalian cells is not well understood. In CHO-K1 cells, feedback control appears to regulate serine base exchange reactions to maintain constant levels of PtdSer. The cells incorporate exogenous PtdSer rapidly, blocking de novo synthesis of PtdSer by a competitive feedback mechanism (31Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Google Scholar, 32Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Google Scholar, 33Kuge O. Saito K. Nishijima M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23844-23849Google Scholar). We hypothesized that PtdSer exposure on the cell surface and subsequent movement into microvesicles may increase the need for more PtdSer as low intracellular PtdSer levels release feedback inhibition of PtdSer biosynthesis in response to the PtdSer scrambling activity. To examine a possible regulatory role of PLSCR, we established CHO cell lines overexpressing PLSCR1 and PLSCR2 isoforms and monitored biosynthesis of serine-derived phospholipids and their movement into the vesicles during UV-induced apoptosis. Our studies suggest that PLSCR activity influences both synthesis and reorientation of PtdSer in an isoform-specific and caspase-dependent manner during apoptosis. Anti-c-Myc mAb was purchased from Clontech. Anti-human poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) pAb was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-ACTIVE®-caspase-3 pAb was from Promega. LipofectAMINE 2000 was obtained from Invitrogen. Annexin-V-FLUOS staining kit was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Strain CHO-K1 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (CANSERA) and 300 μm proline. Cells grown in regular growth medium were rinsed with and reseeded in fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with different modifications. The cells were exposed to a germicidal lamp providing predominantly 254-nm UV-C light (Philips TUV G30T8 30 W bulb) for 10 min and cultured for different periods of time. Murine PLSCR1 cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF159593) was kindly provided by Dr. Peter Sims (17Wiedmer T. Zhou Q. Kwoh D.Y. Sims P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 244-253Google Scholar, 34Zhou Q. Zhao J. Stout J.G. Luhm R.A. Wiedmer T. Sims P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18240-18244Google Scholar). Murine PLSCR2 homolog cDNA was obtained from ATCC expressed sequence tag clone 1191848, and DNA sequencing indicated that all amino acids were the same as those deposited in GenBank except for a highly conserved Arg-Lys transition at position 178 (GenBank™ accession numberAF015790) (21Zhou Q. Sims P.J. Wiedmer T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2356-2360Google Scholar). EcoRI and XhoI sites were engineered into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the full coding sequences of PLSCR1 by PCR amplification with primer 1, 5′-GACGAATTCATGGAAAACCACAGCAAGCAAACT-3′, and primer 2, 5′-GCACTCGAGCTGCCATGCTCCTGATCTTTGCTC-3′. NotI and ApaI sites were added to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the full coding sequences of PLSCR2 by PCR amplification with primer 1, 5′-GACGCGGCCGCATGGAGGCTCCTCGCTCAGGAACA-3′, and primer 2, 5′-GCAGGGCCCCTCACAGCCTTCAAAAAACATGTA-3′. PCR-amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and checked by DNA sequencing. Full coding sequences were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(+) A expression vector (Invitrogen) to generate the expression plasmids pcDNA-PLSCR1 and pcDNA-PLSCR2. CHO-K1 cells grown to 80–90% confluence were transfected with pcDNA-PLSCR1 or pcDNA-PLSCR2 constructs (1 μg of plasmid DNA) using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were grown for 24 h before further analysis. To increase the effectiveness of selection, CHO-K1 cells were co-transfected with empty pTK-Hyg vector (Clontech) and pcDNA-PLSCR1 or pcDNA-PLSCR2 constructs according to the manufacturer's instructions. One day after LipofectAMINE 2000 transfection, selection medium containing 350 μg of G418/ml and 200 μg of hygromycin B/ml (Invitrogen) was added to the cells, and the medium was refreshed every 48 h after the initial addition of antibiotics. Cell death was observed by 3 days after adding antibiotics. Stable clones were obtained by dilution subcloning and characterized by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. The cells overexpressing PLSCR1, PLSCR2, and vector control clone were maintained in regular growth medium containing 350 μg of G418/ml and 200 μg of hygromycin/ml. Cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS). For PARP preparations, the cell extracts were collected by lysing 1 × 107 cells in 200 μl of sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.25% SDS, 3.3% β-mercaptoethanol, 12.5% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue). For scramblase preparations, total protein extracts were prepared by lysing cells in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 40 μl/ml 5× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in TBS) followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein in a 200-μl aliquot was precipitated with 1 ml of cold acetone. The protein concentration of each sample was determined using a micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (8% for PARP and 10% for Myc-tagged PLSCR1 and PLSCR2) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For PARP antibody blotting, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with hybridization solution containing anti-human PARP (1:4,000) in 5% skim milk with TTBS (0.04% Tween 20 in TBS). The blot was rinsed with TBS and incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:10,000) in 5% skim milk with TTBS. For detection of Myc-tagged proteins, the membrane was incubated with hybridization solution containing anti-c-Myc mAb (1:2,000) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The blot was then incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (1:10,000). Enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) was used to detect relevant proteins according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were exposed to UV light for 10 min and cultured for 8 h. The attached cells were released using 0.25% trypsin and combined with the culture medium containing floating dead cells. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min and were resusupended in PBS in the presence of an equal volume of trypan blue solution (0.4%, w/v); the percentage of blue cells/total cells was counted using a hemocytometer. The cells were grown on glass coverslips. After incubation, the cells were fixed with formaldehyde (3%, v/v) and permeabilized with 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at −20 °C. The cells were incubated with anti-c-Myc mAb (1:500, v/v) in PBS containing 1% BSA (PBS-BSA) overnight at 4 °C and rinsed with PBS-BSA. Alexa flour 488-conjugated goat anti mouse secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was added (2 μg/ml) and incubated for 45 min at 22 °C. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS-BSA. The coverslips were mounted in 2.5% 1,4-diazabicyclo (2,2,2)octane and 90% glycerol in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0) on glass slides. Detection of activation of caspase 3 was performed with overnight incubation with anti-ACTIVE®-caspase-3 pAb (1:500, v/v) at 4 °C followed by staining with Alexa flour 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG at 22 °C. Propidium iodide was added 30 min after incubation with the secondary antibody and incubated for another 15 min. Alexa flour 488 staining was visualized with excitation at 488 nm, and PI staining was visualized with excitation at 543 nm using a Zeiss inverted laser-scanning confocal microscope, LSM-510. Superimposed images were obtained with LSM-510 Image software. After incubation of cells with 20 μCi of [3H]serine, 3 μCi of [3H]choline, or 2 μCi of [14C]ethanolamine per dish for various times, the culture medium was removed and saved. The cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of cold PBS, and both washes were combined with the original culture medium. The cells were harvested by scraping in 3.5 ml of methanol:water (5:4, v/v). The lipids were extracted from cell pellets and medium using a modified Folch procedure (35Folch J. Lee M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Google Scholar, 36Thomas S.E. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Spence M.W. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1044: 349-356Google Scholar). Radioactivity in lipid extracts was quantitated using a liquid scintillation counter. Phospholipids were separated using TLC with a solvent system of chloroform:ethanol:triethylamine:water (40:50:40:10, v/v/v/v) and quantitated with a Bioscan 200 Imaging Analyzer. Total phospholipid mass was determined by measuring phosphorus content of the lipid extracts (37Rouser G. Siakatos A.N. Fleisher S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Google Scholar). Total phospholipid biosynthesis was normalized to total phosphorus in the lipid extracts. The data from three or four experiments were expressed as the means ± S.E., and the statistical differences were calculated using Student's ttest. Cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed with PBS. Annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and PI staining was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After rinsing coverslips with binding buffer to remove unbound annexin-V and PI, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and rinsed twice with PBS. The coverslips were mounted on glass slides. For the same area of each sample, a differential interference contrast image (for total cells), a green fluorescent image (for annexin-V-positive cells), and a red fluorescent image (for PI-positive cells) were acquired with the Zeiss LSM-510; superimposed images were obtained with LSM-510 Image software. After removal of the culture medium, the cell lysate was prepared by scraping cells in 0.5 ml of ice-cold suspension buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5) and sonicating for 30 s on ice. The samples were centrifuged at −4 °C at 600 ×g for 2 min. The supernatant from cell extracts (100 μl) was added to an equal volume of prewarmed assay mixture (5 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), and 1 μCi of [3H]serine) and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min (38Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5790-5794Google Scholar). The reactions were terminated by adding 1.5 ml of methanol:H2O (5:4, v/v) and 2 ml of chloroform. The samples were mixed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. Lipid was extracted using a modified Folch procedure, and the total radioactivity was determined using a liquid scintillation counter. Protein concentration was measured using a Micro BCA kit. Previous studies indicate that endogenous PLSCR1 cannot be detected in CHO-K1 cells by Western blotting, and no scramblase activity is detected by in vitroenzyme assays (27Frasch S.C. Henson P.M. Kailey J.M. Richter D.A. Janes M.S. Fadok V.A. Bratton D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23065-23073Google Scholar). CHO-K1 cells were transfected with pcDNA-PLSCR1 or pcDNA-PLSCR2 constructs and clones stably overexpressing PLSCR1 and PLSCR2 were then selected. Initially, selection using G418 alone failed to produce positive clones, raising the possibility that cells overexpressing PLSCR were outgrown by cells where only the neomycin resistance gene was incorporated. We then used a strategy to select G418 and hygromycin B-resistant cells by co-transfecting cells with vector containing PLSCR and an empty vector containing a hygromycin resistance gene. With this approach, several G418/hygromycin-resistant clones were isolated. Introduction of a C-terminal Myc tag ensured that the overexpressed proteins could be detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence using an anti-c-Myc mAb. A single protein band was detected in stable expressing clones transfected with pcDNA-PLSCR1 or PLSCR2 constructs, and both Myc-tagged-PLSCR isoforms migrated with predicted molecular weights. No endogenous protein from clones transfected with empty pcDNA3.1 vectors was recognized by anti-c-Myc mAb (Fig. 1 A). Immunofluorescence analyses of these cells showed a predominantly plasma membrane localization of PLSCR1 cells (Fig. 1 B,middle panel); in some cells, highly expressed PLSCR1 also was seen in the cell nucleus. Membrane vesiculation also was observed in cells overexpressing PLSCR1 (Fig. 1 B, middle panel, arrows). Overexpressed PLSCR2 was found predominantly in the nucleus but also was apparent in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, right panel). Low background staining in vector control cells confirmed the high specificity of anti-c-Myc mAb toward overexpressed PLSCR proteins (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Collectively, our data indicated that CHO-K1 clones stably overexpressing c-Myc-tagged PLSCR1 and PLSCR2 were generated and that the levels of expression and subcellular localization of the introduced proteins could be readily detected with anti-c-Myc mAb. PLSCR-expressing clones with the best expression rate were used in the following experiments. When cells were seeded at same density and monitored for 5 days for their growth rate, vector control cells doubled every 24 h similar to the wild type CHO-K1 cells, whereas cells overexpressing PLSCR1 grew at a slower rate; by day 4, cell growth was inhibited by 70% compared with vector control cells (Fig. 2 A). The shape of PLSCR1-expressing cells was significantly different from that of wild type CHO-K1 cells, the former being rounder and smaller (Fig. 2 B, left panels). PLSCR2-expressing cells were larger than vector control cells and had a similar growth rate from day 1–3. After reaching confluence (day 4 or 5), contact inhibition between PLSCR2-expressing cells resulted in a decreased growth rate compared with the vector control cells. When apoptosis was induced in cells overexpressing PLSCR1 or PLSCR2 by exposing them to UV light for 10 min, cells overexpressing PLSCR1 developed much earlier signs of apoptotic morphology than UV-treated vector cells. Six hours after UV irradiation, when a majority of control cells with empty vector showed little signs of apoptosis, the PLSCR1-expressing cells became strongly light reflecting, and cell shrinkage was obvious (Fig. 2 B,right panels). PLSCR2-expressing cells did not show major differences in developing apoptotic cell morphology compared with vector cells. When cell death was monitored with a trypan blue exclusion assay, PLSCR1-expressing cells showed a higher basal level of cell death, and UV treatment resulted in 30% dead cells, whereas no significant cell death was observed in UV treatment of vector cells 8 h after UV irradiation (Fig. 2 C). To detect pro-caspase-3 activation as a marker for the progression of apoptosis, antibody that only recognizes active caspase-3 was used to detect caspase activation in PLSCR1-expressing and vector cells (Fig.3 A). A higher basal level of cell death mediated by PLSCR1 overexpression was confirmed because about 4% of the cells showed positive staining of active caspase-3 (Fig. 3 B). Extensive activation of caspase-3 (65%) was observed in PLSCR1 cells, whereas only a few vector cells (15%) showed positive signals of activated caspase-3 following 8 h of incubation after UV irradiation. Nuclear condensation and fragmentation also were observed in apoptotic cells that showed positive staining for caspase-3 activation. No differences in caspase-3 activation and nuclear morphology were observed with PLSCR2-expressing cells compared with UV-treated vector cells. Thus, PLSCR1 overexpression conferred growth suppression and promoted UV-induced apoptosis in CHO-K1 cells, whereas PLSCR2 protein did not have similar effects. PLSCR1 is key in mobilizing phospholipids at the plasma membrane. Overexpression of PLSCR1 in CHO-K1 cells resulted in a slightly higher basal level of PtdSer externalization, whereas PtdSer on the cell surface remained low in vector control cells without UV irradiation (Fig. 4 A). When apoptosis was induced with UV irradiation, PtdSer levels on the surface of PLSCR1 cells increased as early as 3 h after treatment (data not shown). By 8 h, the majority of PLSCR1 cells showed positive annexin-V-fluorescein isothiocyanate stain, indicating major PtdSer externalization, whereas UV-treated vector cells showed minor changes (Fig. 4). The integrity of cell membranes was maintained, and few cells were stained with propidium iodide in their nuclei. PLSCR2-expressing cells did not show major differences in exposure of PtdSer compared with vector cells with or without UV treatment (Fig. 4 B). PtdSer externalization also was greatly inhibited by the presence of z-VAD-fmk both in UV-irradiated PLSCR1-expressing and vector cells (Fig. 4). Thus, PLSCR1 overexpression facilitated apoptosis and increased PtdSer externalization in CHO-K1 cells after UV irradiation in a caspase-dependent manner, whereas PLSCR2 overexpression did not appear to enhance PtdSer externalization or cell death. Our previous study with U937 cells showed that de novo synthesis of PtdSer was stimulated 2–3-fold during programmed cell death induced by various stimulators of apoptosis (28Yu A. Byers D.M. Ridgway N.D. McMaster C.R. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1487: 296-308Google Scholar). Our preliminary experiments indicated that similar stimulation of PtdSer biosynthesis also was observed in CHO-K1 cells during UV-induced apoptosis. To test the hypothesis that PtdSer biosynthesis and externalization to the cell surface were related events and that increased outward movement of PtdSer may further increase PtdSer biosynthesis, we measured the biosynthesis of PtdSer and other serine-derived phospholipids using cells overexp"
https://openalex.org/W2119624610,"The BCL-2 family member BAX plays a critical role in regulating apoptosis. Surprisingly, bax-deficient mice display limited phenotypic abnormalities. Here we investigate the effect of BAX on infection by the sexually transmitted pathogen,Chlamydia muridarum (the mouse pneumonitis strain ofChlamydia trachomatis). Bax −/−cells are relatively resistant to Chlamydia-induced apoptosis, and fewer bacteria are recovered after two infection cycles from Bax −/− cells than from wild-type cells. These results suggest that BAX-dependent apoptosis may be used to initiate a new round of infection, most likely by releasingChlamydia-containing apoptotic bodies from infected cells that could be internalized by neighboring uninfected cells. Nonetheless, infected Bax −/− cells die through necrosis, which is normally associated with inflammation, more often than infected wild-type cells. These studies were confirmed in mice infected intravaginally with C. muridarum; since the infection disappears more quickly from Bax −/−mice than from wild-type mice, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines is increased in Bax −/− mice, and large granulomas are present in the genital tract ofBax −/− mice. Taken together, these data suggest that chlamydia-induced apoptosis via BAX contributes to bacterial propagation and decreases inflammation. Baxdeficiency results in lower infection and an increased inflammatory cytokine response associated with more severe pathology.

Chlamydia species provoke serious infections of humans and animals worldwide, despite extensive work to better characterize the biology of the infection and develop effective vaccines (1Schachter J. Caldwell H.D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1980; 34: 285-310Google Scholar, 2Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Google Scholar, 3Campbell L.A. Kuo C.C. Grayston J.T. Emerg.

It is estimated that over 600 million persons are infected withChlamydia trachomatis, whose strains include the most common sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen (4Gerbase A.C. Rowley J.T. Mertens T.E. Lancet. 1998; 351: 2-4Google Scholar) as well as causative agents of conjunctivitis and trachoma. There are an estimated 4 million new cases annually of genital C. trachomatis infections of the male and female within the United States (5Washington A.E. Johnson R.E. Sanders Jr., L.L. JAMA (J. Am.

An important element in the design of a vaccine for the prevention or control of chlamydial infections is a complete understanding of the immune response to infection. Little is known about the pathogenesis of human chlamydial infections, and most of our knowledge of acute infection has been obtained from animal models such as the mouse model with Chlamydia muridarum (the mouse pneumonitis (MoPn) 1The abbreviations used are: MoPn, C. trachomatis mouse pneumonitis strain; EB, elementary body; IL, interleukin; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; PS, phosphatidylserine; PI, propidium iodide; PMN, polymorphonuclear neutrophils; IFN, interferon strain of C. trachomatis) (6Everett K.D.E.

Chlamydia: Intracellular Biology, Pathogenesis, and Immunity. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 239-295Google Scholar). In controlled studies in guinea pigs and mice (9Barron A.L. White H.J. Rank R.G. Soloff B.L. Moses E.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 63-66Google Scholar, 10de la Maza L.M. Pal S. Khamesipour A.

Pathol. 1992; 140: 927-936Google Scholar), bacteria are initially detected in the cervical epithelium, but the pathology ascends in most animals to the endometrium and the oviducts within 7–9 days after intravaginal inoculation. Most of the damage due to Chlamydia is not due to the infection itself but to the inflammation and fibrosis that follow the infection (2Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Google Scholar). Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are typically observed in the cervix as early as 2 days after infection, and acute inflammation in the uterine horns and oviducts follows within 5–7 days (2Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Google Scholar). A number of inflammatory mediators are present during infection, including interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α), which have been detected in the Fallopian tubes from humans infected with C. trachomatis (12Toth M. Jeremias J. Ledger W.J. Witkin S.S. Surg. Gynecol. Obstet. 1992; 174: 359-362Google Scholar) and in secretions fromChlamydia-infected mice and guinea pigs (13Darville T. Laffoon K.K. Kishen L.R. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4675-4681Google Scholar, 14Darville T. Andrews C.W. Laffoon K.K. Shymasani W. Kishen L.R. Rank R.G. Infect.

TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines may aid in eradicatingChlamydia infection but also may promote long term tissue damage (14Darville T. Andrews C.W. Laffoon K.K. Shymasani W. Kishen L.R. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3064-3073Google Scholar). Contrasting with the epidemiological and pathological diversity ofChlamydia infections is the relative uniformity of the chlamydial infectious process. All Chlamydia sp. are thought to enter into, survive, and multiply within mucosal epithelial cells by conserved mechanisms involving a unique obligate intracellular developmental cycle, consisting of two phases (16Rockey D.D. Matsumoto A. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 403-425Google Scholar). The extracellular form of Chlamydia, the elementary body (EB), is infectious and is thought to be metabolically inert. The EB are internalized into host epithelial cells into small vacuoles resembling endosomes, most of which avoid fusion with host cell lysosomes. The EB differentiate within the entry vacuole into metabolically active reticulate bodies, which are presumably noninfectious (17Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Google Scholar). The reticulate bodies proliferate within the same membrane-bound vacuole and, after several divisions, differentiate back into EB. After 2–3 days, the EB are released from the infected cell through unknown mechanisms and begin a new cycle of infection (16Rockey D.D. Matsumoto A. Brun Y.V. Shimkets L.J. Prokaryotic Development. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 403-425Google Scholar, 17Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Google Scholar). This biphasic developmental cycle allows for multiple sites of communication between the chlamydial pathogen and the host cell, many of which probably play a significant role in the pathogen-host cell relationship and thus strongly impact the outcome of the infection. An example of such a communication are the chlamydial signals that block and then later induce apoptosis of the host cell. Like mycobacteria,Cryptosporidium parvum, and the herpes virus (18Gao L.-Y. Abu Kwaik Y. Trends Microbiol. 2000; 8: 306-313Google Scholar, 19Galvan V. Roizman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3931-3936Google Scholar, 20Chen X.M. Gores G.J. Paya C.V. LaRusso N.F.

Immun. 2001; 69: 7880-7888Google Scholar) and induce apoptosis of the host cell during later stages of the infection cycle (26Gibellini D. Panaya R. Rumpianesi F. Zentralblatt für Bakteriologie. 1998; 288: 35-43Google Scholar, 27Perfettini J.-L. Darville T. Gachelin G. Souque P. Huerre M. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect.

Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar). The resistance to cell death may account for the observation that Fas- and perforin-dependent killer lymphocytes are not able to clear the infection in mice (30Perry L.L. Feilzer K. Hughes S. Caldwell H.D. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1379-1385Google Scholar). Conversely, we had proposed that apoptosis due to the infection may be used by the chlamydiae to exit from infected cells and propagate within the host (29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, many of the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis are due to activation of caspases, which can be initiated through engagement of cell surface receptors such as Fas (31Nagata S. Cell. 1997; 88: 355-365Google Scholar) or following release from mitochondria of cytochrome c, which associates with the apoptosis regulator Apaf-1 and thereby activates caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-3 (32Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Google Scholar). Both pathways are regulated by the BCL-2 family of proteins, which consists of antiapoptotic factors, such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL, and proapoptotic proteins, such as BAX and BAK (33Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Google Scholar). BCL-2 proteins prevent apoptosis by preventing the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, whereas BAX stimulates release of cytochrome c(34Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Google Scholar, 35Rossé T. Olivier R. Monney L. Rager M. Conus S. Fellay I. Jansen B. Borner C. Nature. 1998; 391: 441-442Google Scholar). Nonetheless, caspase activation is not required for all types of cell death (36Deas O. Dumont C. MacFarlane M. Rouleau M. Hebib C. Harper F. Hirsch F. Charpentier B. Cohen G.M. Senik A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3375-3383Google Scholar, 37Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Google Scholar, 38McCarthy N.J. Whyte M.K.B. Gilbert C.S. Evan G.I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 215-227Google Scholar), and overexpression of BAX or BAK induces cell death without the involvement of caspases (37Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Google Scholar, 39Pastorino J.G. Chen S.T. Tafani M. Snyder J.W. Farber J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7770-7775Google Scholar), suggesting that factors other than caspases can also mediate apoptosis. Apoptosis of Chlamydia-infected cells triggered with external ligands is blocked through inhibition of cytochromec release and caspase-3 activation (22Fan T. Lu H. Shi L. McCarthy G.A. Nance D.M. Greenberg A.H. Zhong G. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 487-496Google Scholar), whereas apoptosis induced by the infection itself is independent of known caspases (28Perfettini J.L. Reed J.C. Israël N. Martinou J.C. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 55-61Google Scholar,29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar). We have found that BAX is activated and translocates from the cytosol to mitochondria in infected cells, and inhibition of BAX by overexpression of BAX inhibitor-1 or BCL-2 inhibitsChlamydia-induced apoptosis (28Perfettini J.L. Reed J.C. Israël N. Martinou J.C. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 55-61Google Scholar). Caspase-1 is not thought to be involved in apoptosis (40Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Google Scholar), except when targeted specifically by bacterial products secreted by Shigella flexneri orSalmonella sp. (41Hersh D. Monack D.M. Smith M.R. Ghori N. Falkow S. Zychlinsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2396-2401Google Scholar, 42Hilbi H. Moss J.E. Hersh D. Chen Y. Arondel J. Banerjee S. Flavell R.A. Yuan J. Sansonetti P.J. Zychlinsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32895-32900Google Scholar). Nonetheless, caspase-1 is required for maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18, and caspase-1 is activated during Chlamydia infection of monocytes and epithelial cells (29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar, 43Lu H. Shen C. Brunham R.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 1463-1469Google Scholar). The preferential target tissue of sexually transmitted chlamydial infections in females is the columnar epithelium of the cervix (2Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Google Scholar, 17Moulder J.W. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 143-190Google Scholar), but monocytes and macrophages can also be infected (44La Verda D. Byrne G.I. Immunol. Ser. 1994; 60: 381-399Google Scholar) and may aid in disseminating the infection by certain serovars ofChlamydia. Since macrophages undergoing apoptosis secrete IL-1 (45Hogquist K.A. Nett M.A. Unanue E.R. Chaplin D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8485-8489Google Scholar), it is conceivable that apoptosis of these cells duringChlamydia infection may contribute to the inflammatory response. Conversely, cytokines such as TNF-α are able to induce apoptosis of some target cells (46Golstein P. Ojcius D.M. Young J.D. Immunol. Rev. 1991; 121: 29-65Google Scholar), suggesting that the inflammation following Chlamydia infection may also directly trigger apoptosis. Since BAX is activated during infection of an epithelial cell linein vitro (28Perfettini J.L. Reed J.C. Israël N. Martinou J.C. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 55-61Google Scholar), we here used Bax-deficient cells to evaluate the role of BAX in Chlamydia-induced apoptosis and to investigate the effect of BAX-dependent apoptosis on the yield of chlamydiae obtained from at least two infection cyclesin vitro. The availability of Bax-deficient mice also allowed us to confirm a role for BAX during genital tract infection in vivo and to measure the host inflammatory response during infection of wild-type and Bax-deficient mice. The mouse pneumonitis agent (MoPn) ofC. trachomatis (C. muridarum) was from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). Bacteria were prepared, and cells were infected as previously described (29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar). TheBax +/+ (wild type),Bax −/−, Bid +/+, andBid −/− murine embryonic fibroblasts were described (47Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 2: 727-730Google Scholar). All other cells and materials were described (28Perfettini J.L. Reed J.C. Israël N. Martinou J.C. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 55-61Google Scholar,48Perfettini J.-L. Gissot M. Souque P. Ojcius D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 334-344Google Scholar). Murine embryonic fibroblasts were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5. Cell death was measured by cytofluorimetry by staining detergent-permeabilized cells with PI (29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar, 49Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Google Scholar) or by double-staining unpermeabilized cells with PI and annexin V (48Perfettini J.-L. Gissot M. Souque P. Ojcius D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 334-344Google Scholar). Both adherent cells and cells in suspension were collected for analysis. Subconfluent Bax +/+ andBax −/− cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1, and a 10-fold excess of uninfectedBax +/+ cells was added after 24 h of infection. After an additional 2 days of infection, the cells and supernatant were centrifuged for 60 min at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall type GSA rotor. The pellet was freeze-thawed three times and sonicated for 10 min in a bath sonicator at 4 °C to break cells and dissociate aggregates, giving the final suspension of chlamydiae used to measure bacterial yield. Serial dilutions of the chlamydial preparation were used to infect HeLa cells on cover slips for 48 h, and the chlamydial vacuoles were revealed with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-Chlamydia monoclonal antibody, as described (29Ojcius D.M. Souque P. Perfettini J.L. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4220-4226Google Scholar). Samples were examined with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope attached to a cooled CCD camera. At least 10 separate fields containing an average of 200–300 HeLa cells were counted per sample, and the experiment was repeated on three separate occasions. Female Bax +/+ andBax −/− mice on a C57BL/6 background (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, MA) were infected intravaginally with 107 inclusion-forming units of C. muridarum. The course of infection was monitored by periodic cervico-vaginal swabbing of individual animals (50Darville T. Andrews C.W. Sikes J.D. Fraley P.L. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3556-3561Google Scholar). Chlamydiae were isolated from swabs in tissue culture according to standard methods, and inclusions were visualized and enumerated by immunofluorescence (51Ramsey K.H. Newhall W.J. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2441-2446Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean and S.E. of inclusion-forming units per ml. Experiments were repeated once, and there were five animals per experimental group. Groups of mice were sacrificed at 7 and 24 days after primary infection or followed through day 70 and administered a challenge infection with 107 inclusion-forming units of MoPn on day 90, 7 days post-depo-provera treatment. Histopathology and cytokine secretion measurements were performed as described (50Darville T. Andrews C.W. Sikes J.D. Fraley P.L. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3556-3561Google Scholar). Staining of cell surface antigens and qualitative evaluation of cell populations were performed as described by Morrison and Morrison (52Morrison S.G. Morrison R.P. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2870-2879Google Scholar). Vaginal secretions were assayed individually for cytokine or chemokine activity by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercial kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Antibody responses were measured in sera from mice and assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described (14Darville T. Andrews C.W. Laffoon K.K. Shymasani W. Kishen L.R. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3064-3073Google Scholar). All mice were given food ad libitum and maintained in environmentally controlled rooms with a 12/12-h light/dark cycle. All animal studies were approved by the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences' Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Statistical comparisons between the groups of mice for level of infection, antibody production, and cytokine production over the course of infection were made by a two-factor (days and murine strain) analysis of variance with the post hoc Tukey test as a multiple-comparison procedure. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the duration of infection in the respective groups over time. One-way analysis of variance on ranks was used to determine differences in inflammatory cell populations among the groups. All experiments were repeated at least once. We have previously shown that BAX is activated in cells infected with Chlamydia(28Perfettini J.L. Reed J.C. Israël N. Martinou J.C. Dautry-Varsat A. Ojcius D.M. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 55-61Google Scholar). The effect of BAX activation on Chlamydia-induced apoptosis was therefore determined by infecting normal (Bax +/+) and Bax-deficient cells. The infection led to a high level of apoptosis inBax +/+ cells, which was observed after 1 day of infection (Fig. 1 A). At the same multiplicity of infection, the Bax deficiency resulted in a nearly 2-fold inhibition of apoptosis during infection (Fig.1 A), suggesting that this pathway of apoptosis requires, at least partially, BAX activation. Engagement of surface death receptors such as Fas or TNFR1 results in cleavage of the BCL-2 family member BID, which triggers the oligomerization of proapoptotic family members BAK and BAX, leading to cell death (47Wei M.C. Zong W.-X. Cheng E.H.-Y. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 2: 727-730Google Scholar). To determine whether BID cleavage may be required for BAX activation in infected cells, Bid +/+ andBid −/− cells were infected with C. muridarum for 2 days, and apoptosis was measured. No difference was observed in sensitivity to apoptosis of wild-type andBid-deficient cells (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that BAX activation is initiated within the interior of the infected cell. Cells that are prevented from dying through apoptosis still manage to die, but they often succumb later, dying through necrosis (53Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Google Scholar, 54Holler N. Zaru R. Micheau O. Thome M. Attinger A. Valitutti S. Bodmer J.-L. Schneider P. Seed B. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 489-495Google Scholar, 55Matsumura H. Shimizu Y. Ohsawa Y. Kawahara A. Uchiyama Y. Nagata S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1247-1256Google Scholar). To determine quantitatively whether any infected cells may be necrotic, cells were infected for 2 days, and necrosis was measured by double-labeling the cells with PI and annexin V, which binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) that becomes exposed on the surface of dying cells. Cells labeled only with annexin V are considered to be apoptotic, whereas cells labeled only with PI, which have thus lost their plasma membrane integrity, are necrotic; cells labeled with both PI and annexin V are either necrotic or late apoptotic (48Perfettini J.-L. Gissot M. Souque P. Ojcius D.M. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 358: 334-344Google Scholar). Evaluation by cytofluorimetry showed that the Bax −/−cells were dying through necrosis more often thanBax +/+ cells after a 2-day infection. Whereas 30% of the cells were apoptotic and 10% were necrotic in theBax +/+ population, 7% were apoptotic and 34% were necrotic in the Bax −/− population (Fig.1 B). In order to distinguish between the possibility that apoptosis may be used by the bacteria to escape from the infected host cell, rather than by the host cell to eliminate bacteria, Bax +/+ andBax −/− cells were infected for 3 days, and the bacteria were harvested from supernatant and infected cells. The recovered bacteria were then used to reinfect wild-type cells, and the efficiency of infection was evaluated by immunofluorescence. A larger number of infectious chlamydiae were recovered from theBax +/+ than the Bax −/−cells (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that the bacteria may use apoptosis to exit from cells at the end of the first infection cycle before beginning a new round of infection. To rule out the possibility that Bax deficiency may be inhibiting growth of intracellular chlamydiae, the number of infectious vacuoles was also measured after a 24-h infection, before any apoptosis is observed; the infection at 24 h was the same in eitherBax +/+ or Bax −/− cells (not shown). Since fibroblasts and epithelial cells express a PS receptor (56Fadok V. Bratton D.L. Rose D.M. Pearson A. Ezekewitz R.A.B. Henson P.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 85-90Google Scholar) that could be used to phagocytoseChlamydia-containing apoptotic bodies, these results suggest that Chlamydia may use apoptosis to release infectious bacteria from infected host cells in order to initiate a new infection cycle. To confirm whether apoptosis has an effect on the yield of infectious bacteria in vivo, the infection was repeated with Bax +/+ and Bax −/−mice. The mouse model of C. muridarum infection of the female genital tract mimics human infection (2Bavoil P.M. Hsia R.-c. Rank R.G. Bull. Inst. Pasteur. 1996; 94: 5-54Google Scholar, 9Barron A.L. White H.J. Rank R.G. Soloff B.L. Moses E.B. J. Infect. Dis. 1981; 143: 63-66Google Scholar, 10de la Maza L.M. Pal S. Khamesipour A. Peterson E.M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 2094-2097Google Scholar) and is a useful model for Chlamydia infection and adaptive immunity to infection. Bax-deficient mice are also convenient for studies on Chlamydia infection, since the mice are healthy, the levels of the antiapoptotic molecules BCL2 and BCL-XLare unaffected, and the distribution of different lymphocyte populations (CD4−CD8−, CD4+CD8+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells) are unaltered, compared withBax +/+ mice (57Knudson C.M. Tung K.S.K. Tourtellotte W.G. Brown G.A.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 1995; 270: 96-99Google Scholar). The infection was less efficient and disappeared more quickly in theBax −/− mice than in controlBax +/+ mice (Fig.2), consistent with a role for BAX-dependent apoptosis in the propagation of chlamydiaein vivo. Prior studies in our laboratory have shown that murine chlamydial genital tract infection induces strong production of the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-α, and of the murine CXC chemokine, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (14Darville T. Andrews C.W. Laffoon K.K. Shymasani W. Kishen L.R. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3064-3073Google Scholar, 50Darville T. Andrews C.W. Sikes J.D. Fraley P.L. Rank R.G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 3556-3561Google Scholar). These responses routinely peak during the first week of infection and decline toward base line during the second week. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measurement of cytokines in genital tract secretions revealed similar kinetics in the Bax +/+ andBax −/− mice in this study (Fig.3). However, the proinflammatory mediators were significantly increased during the first week of infection in the Bax −/− mice compared with theBax +/+ mice. Further, we detected extremely high levels of IFN-γ, a protein with marked antichlamydial effects, in theBax −/− mice compared withBax +/+ mice during the first week of infection (Fig. 3). The detection of higher levels of inflammatory mediators in the Bax −/− mice compared with theBax +/+ mice is made more significant by the fact that the infection was much less efficient in theBax −/− mice. These data are consistent with increased cell death by necrosis during chlamydial infection in the absence of BAX. Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of genital tract tissues from mice sacrificed on day 7 of primary infection revealed that the early inflammatory response was of similar quality and quantity in Bax +/+ andBax −/− mice. Moderate to severe inflammation was detected in the endocervix and uterine horns with a predominance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) but high numbers of lymphocytes also being seen. By immunohistochemical staining, the median inflammatory score for PMNs was 4 for Bax −/−and 3 for Bax +/+ on day 7 (p = 0.375), and for lymphocytes it was 2.0 forBax −/− and for Bax +/+(p = 0.5) (analysis of variance on ranks). Most of the lymphocytes were CD4+ in both groups, with comparatively low numbers of CD8+ c"

Here, we report the identification of a highly conserved, non-canonical, leucine zipper (LZ1) in the C terminus of mammalian BK channels that is required for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) to associate with the channel and regulate its activity. A synthetic polypeptide encompassing the central d position leucine residues in LZ1 blocks the regulation of recombinant mouse BK channels by endogenous PKA in HEK293 cells. In contrast, neither an alanine-substituted LZ1 peptide nor a peptide corresponding to another, more C-terminal putative leucine zipper, LZ2, had any effect on regulation of the channels by endogenous PKA. Mutagenesis of the central two LZ1 d position leucines to alanine in the BK channel also eliminated regulation by endogenous PKA in HEK293 cells without altering the channel sensitivity to activation by voltage or by exogenous purified PKA. Inclusion of the STREX splice insert in the BK channel protein, which switches channel regulation by PKA from stimulation to inhibition, did not alter the requirement for an intact LZ1. Although PKA does not bind directly to the channel proteinin vitro, mutation of LZ1 abolished co-immunoprecipitation of PKA and the respective BK channel splice variant from HEK293 cells. Furthermore, a 127-amino acid fusion protein encompassing the functional LZ1 domain co-immunoprecipitates a PKA-signaling complex from rat brain.

Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Google Scholar). The co-ordination, specificity, and compartmentalization of ion channel regulation by reversible protein phosphorylation is facilitated by assembly with signaling complexes comprising cognate protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Assembly of ion channels with signaling complexes typically results from multiple protein-protein interactions mediated by distinct interaction domains (2Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Google Scholar) allowing signaling molecules to interact directly with an ion channel or indirectly as part of a higher order complex. Large conductance calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BK) channels have been widely exploited as models of ion channel regulation by reversible protein phosphorylation; however, the molecular basis for kinase and phosphatase assembly with the BK channel is largely unknown (1Levitan I.B. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1999; 33: 3-22Google Scholar, 3Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-7Google Scholar). BK channels play a central role in the regulation of cellular excitability because they are activated directly by both voltage and intracellular free calcium (4Vergara C. Latorre R. Marrion N. Adelman J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 321-329Google Scholar, 5Toro L. Wallner M. Meera P. Tanaka Y. News Physiol. Sci. 1998; 13: 112-117Google Scholar, 6Shipston M.J.

For example, they provide a dynamic link between electrical and chemical signaling events in cells, are major determinants of vascular smooth muscle tone (5Toro L. Wallner M. Meera P. Tanaka Y.

Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 353-358Google Scholar, 8Sah P. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 150-154Google Scholar). A single gene (KCNMA1) encodes for the pore-forming α-subunits of BK channels in all mammalian tissues (9Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Google Scholar). Phenotypic variation in native BK channels results from extensive alternative exon splicing of the α-subunit (6Shipston M.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 353-358Google Scholar, 9Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Google Scholar, 10Xie J. McCobb D.P.

Although several consensus phosphorylation sites have been identified by mutagenesis within the intracellular C-terminal domain, BK channel α-subunits do not contain previously identified protein-protein interaction domains. Thus, the molecular basis for protein kinase or phosphatase targeting to mammalian BK channels is essentially unknown. In Drosophila, the catalytic subunit, but not the holoenzyme, of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)1 binds directly to the intracellular C terminus (3Wang J. Zhou Y. Wen H. Levitan I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-7Google Scholar, 19Zhou Y. Wang J. Wen H. Kucherovsky O. Levitan I.B. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3855-3863Google Scholar) of the channel. Although PKA co-immunoprecipitates with mammalian BK channels in a splice variant-independent manner, the mechanism of complex assembly is unknown (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). Recently a structural motif, the leucine zipper (LZ), originally described in classes of DNA-binding proteins (20Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar), has been reported to play an important role in coordinating both the assembly of ion channels as well as their interaction with protein kinase and protein phosphatase signaling complexes (21Hulme J.T. Ahn M. Hauschka S.D. Scheuer T. Catterall W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4079-4087Google Scholar, 22Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J.

Kobayashi Y.M. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5941-5946Google Scholar). In several of these channels the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) is targeted to the channel through a protein kinase A-anchoring protein (AKAP). The AKAP acts as an adapter protein by binding to both the LZ domain of the channel and the regulatory subunits of PKA. In this report we identify a putative LZ domain for BK channel assembly with a PKA signaling complex essential for the functional regulation of mammalian BK channels by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. The cloning and sub-cloning of the mouse BK channel splice variants ZERO and STREX into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 or pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) have been described previously (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar, 25Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Google Scholar). A C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag was introduced into each channel construct by replacing the normal stop codon with a sequence encoding the HA tag from a mouse BK channel construct kindly provided by Dr. Yi Zhou and Prof. Irwin B Levitan. The C terminus is thus identical to the mouse mbr5 (GenBankTM accession number GI:347144) sequence present in the original clones apart from the HA tag (REVEDECYPYDVPDYA*), where the italicized amino acids indicate HA-tag amino acids replacing the normal stop codon. Amino acid numbering in the subsequent text and figures is in accordance with the amino acid sequence of the mouse mbr5 clone (accession number: GI:347144; the start methionine being M1ELEH) for consistency. Alanine substitutions in the third and fourth LZ1 d position leucine residues (Fig. 1: amino acids Leu-530 and Leu-537) was performed by site-directed mutagenesis using a single mutagenic primer set with the QuikChange system according to the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate the HA-tagged LZ1 mutant channels ZEROL530A/L537A and STREXL530A/L537A. Thioredoxin fusion proteins were generated by PCR and subcloning fragments into the pBAD/Thio-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Fusion proteins were constructed with an N-terminal His-patch (HP)-thioredoxin fusion and C-terminal V5 and hexahistidine epitopes to facilitate purification and immunoprecipitation. All soluble fusion proteins were induced and purified from BL21 RIL Escherichia coli using standard methods. All immunoprecipitations using thioredoxin fusion proteins were performed with the intact HP-thioredoxin fusion, because cleavage of the thioredoxin fusion resulted in proteins that were largely insoluble. The LZ1489–616 thioredoxin fusion protein was designed to span the LZ1 domain from the end of the predicted regulator of potassium conductance (RCK) domain βE strand (26Jiang Y.X. Lee A. Chen J.Y. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y.X. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Google Scholar, 28Quirk J.C. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 2001; 32: 13-23Google Scholar) starting at amino acid Gln-489 and extending to amino acid Ile-616 (Fig.5 a). LZ1489–616 thus does not include core RCK domain residues essential for tetramerization (28Quirk J.C. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 2001; 32: 13-23Google Scholar). The ZERO580–984 and STREX580–984 thioredoxin fusion proteins were designed to span LZ2 and to include the mammalian STREX alternative site of splicing as well as the conserved PKA consensus site at S899 (Fig. 5 a). The starting amino acid in the respective construct was Val-580 and terminating in amino acid Ala-984. ZERO580–984 and STREX580–984 are, thus, identical apart from the addition of 59 amino acids of the mouse STREX (25Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Google Scholar) insert in STREX 580–984 (Fig. 5 a: amino acid numbering has been retained as for ZERO for consistency) and do not contain LZ1. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Leucine zipper competing peptides were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA) and used at a final bath concentration of 25–80 μm. Concentrations of peptide <5 μm were largely ineffective (data not shown). The LZ1 peptide (D QSCLAQGLSTMLANLFS) corresponds to amino acids 523–539, spanning the 2nd, 3rd, and 4thd positions in the mouse 5-heptad repeat LZ1 motif (Fig.1 a) except that an N-terminal aspartate (D) residue was included to improve water solubility. The corresponding alanine substituted peptide (Ala-LZ1) was identical except that the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th LZ1 heptad repeat d residues were replaced by alanine (D ASCLAQGASTMLANAFS). The LZ2 peptide (DLRAVNINLCDMCVILS) corresponds to conserved residues 818–834 within a putative C-terminal 4-heptad repeat LZ motif in the mouse BK channel (Fig.1 a). HEK293 cells were subcultured essentially as previously described (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar, 25Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Google Scholar) except with one modification whereby cells were placed in serum-free (ITS, Invitrogen) medium 24 h before experiments. Briefly, cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were routinely passaged every 3–7 days using 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 0.1% EDTA. For immunoblotting studies cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 75-cm2 flasks. For electrophysiological assays cells were plated on glass coverslips in 6-well cluster dishes. Twenty-four hours before the experiment cells were washed, and medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ITS serum replacement (Invitrogen). For transient transfections of BK channels HEK293 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 6-well cluster dishes at a density to allow cells reaching 40–60% confluence after 24 h. Cells were then transfected with 1 μg of the respective cDNA using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium essentially as described by the manufacturer. After 5 h medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, which was replaced after 24 h, and electrophysiological recordings made 24–72 h post-transfection. Stable cell lines were also created by selection and maintenance for Zeocin or Geneticin resistance using 0.2 mg ml−1 Zeocin (Invitrogen) or 0.8 mg ml−1Geneticin (Invitrogen) as appropriate. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of HA-tagged channels or PKA was performed using transient or stably expressing HEK293 cell lines essentially as previously described (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized in radioimmunoassay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the lysate was pre-cleared by incubation with 20 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C. PKA- or HA-tagged channels were immunoprecipitated from the cleared lysate with the respective antibody (prebound to 40 μl of 50% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose) for 4 h at 4 °C. IP antibodies used were mouse anti-HA monoclonal antibody (clone: 12CA5, Roche Diagnostics) for HA-tagged channels, a sheep anti-PKAc polyclonal antibody (ab365 (29Aspbury R. Fisher M. Rees H. Clegg R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 523-527Google Scholar), a generous gift from Dr Roger A Clegg), or a rabbit anti-PKAc polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). The immunoprecipitate was washed 5 times with 1 ml of radioimmunoassay buffer before SDS-PAGE analysis. For Western blot detection a rabbit anti-HA polyclonal (Y-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and the above sheep anti-PKAc polyclonal were used as described in figure legends (Figs. 4 and 5). IP of thioredoxin fusion proteins of the BK channel intracellular C terminus employed a mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen). Detection was by enhanced chemiluminescence. All experiments were performed in the inside-out configuration of the patch clamp technique at room temperature (20–24 °C) using physiological potassium gradients essentially as described previously (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). The pipette solution (extracellular) contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution (intracellular) contained 140 mm KCl, 5 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 or 5 mm BAPTA, 30 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.3, with free calcium [Ca2+]i buffered to 0.2 μm unless indicated otherwise. For assays in which the catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc, Promega, Madison, WI) was applied directly to patches, patches were exposed to the above intracellular bathing solution containing 0.1 mm dithiothreitol during control and PKAc application to exclude effects dues to dithiothreitol (30Erxleben C. Everhart A.L. Romeo C. Florance H. Bauer M.B. Alcorta D.A. Rossie S. Shipston M.J. Armstrong D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27045-27052Google Scholar) present in purified PKAc preparations. Data acquisition and voltage protocols were controlled by an Axopatch 200 A or B amplifier and pCLAMP6 software (Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). All recordings were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. After patch excision channel activity was allowed to stabilize for at least 10 min (typically 10–15 min after excision), and stability plot experiments demonstrated that BK channel activity was stable for >1 h under the recording conditions used (data not shown) in the absence of channel modulators. Application of cAMP or other reagents to the intracellular face of patches was by gravity-driven perfusion (10 volumes of the recording bath solution (bath volume, 0.5 ml) by gravity-driven perfusion at a flow rate of 1–2 ml/min) or direct application to the bath. Channel activity was determined during 30-s depolarizations to +40 mV. Single-channel open probability (P o) was derived either from single-channel analysis using pSTAT for patches with <4 channels or, in the case of patches with >4 channels, by an integration-over-baseline algorithm using Igor Pro 4.1 (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). In the latter case N P o (number of functional channels × open probability of channel) values were determined as follows. All-point histograms were plotted to obtain the “offset,” i.e. leak current, as well as the single-channel current amplitude from the peak intervals. After subtraction of the offset from the traces these were integrated over 0.5–60-s segments. The integral divided by integration time and single-channel current amplitude gives NP o. To determine mean percent (%) change in channel activity after a treatment in patches with low to moderate levels of channel expression, mean P o or N × P o was averaged from several minutes of recording at +40 mV immediately before and 10 min after the respective drug treatment. Mean change in activity was expressed as a percentage (%) of the pretreatment control ±S.E. In the respective figure legends and text (see “Results”) a positive percentage (%) change in activity reflects activation, whereas a negative percentage (%) change reflects channel inhibition. The amino acid sequence of LZ motifs is typically characterized by a seven-residue (heptad) repeat (commonly denoted abcdefg, see Fig.1, a and b) with positions a and d in each heptad repeat occupied by hydrophobic residues (20Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Google Scholar). Leucine provides the most thermodynamically stable residue at position d (32Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Google Scholar). However, significant deviations in amino acid sequence from this “classical” leucine zipper motif may exist, for example, deletions or insertions of individual residues within the heptad repeat or the presence of polar residues at position a or d(22Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Google Scholar, 31Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Google Scholar, 32Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Google Scholar, 34Brown J.H. Cohen C. Parry D.A.D. Proteins. 1996; 26: 134-145Google Scholar). Allowing for such variability, manual inspection of the C-terminal amino acid sequence of mammalian BK channels revealed several putative LZ motifs. A C-terminal LZ motif (LZ1, Fig. 1, a andb, between residues 513 and 548 of the murine BK channel variant mbr5 (accession number GI:347144 (9Butler A. Tsunoda S. McCobb D.P. Wei A. Salkoff L. Science. 1993; 261: 221-224Google Scholar)) contains five heptad repeats downstream of residues that contribute to the proposed “fixed interface” of the BK channel regulator of K channel conductance (RCK, or tetramerization) domain (26Jiang Y.X. Lee A. Chen J.Y. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y.X. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Google Scholar, 28Quirk J.C. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 2001; 32: 13-23Google Scholar). Although the second dresidue of the five-heptad LZ1 repeat is glutamine (Q) and the fiftha residue is non-hydrophobic, the stability of “prototypical” LZ domains with a Gln (Q) residue at a singled position is, paradoxically, not significantly compromised compared with isoleucine or valine substitutions (32Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of mammalian BK channels with the structure of the RCK domain in calcium-activated potassium (MthK) channels fromMethanobacterium thermoautotrophicum suggests that LZ1 forms the αG helix and also contributes to an extended linker region between the αG helix and βG strand (26Jiang Y.X. Lee A. Chen J.Y. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2002; 417: 515-522Google Scholar, 27Jiang Y.X. Pico A. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Neuron. 2001; 29: 593-601Google Scholar, 28Quirk J.C. Reinhart P.H. Neuron. 2001; 32: 13-23Google Scholar). However, in MthK the extended linker is absent, and the mammalian LZ1 heptad repeats are not conserved in MthK or other prokaryotic RCK domains (Fig.1 a), suggesting LZ1 and the linker region play an additional role in mammalian BK channels. A second putative four-heptad repeat LZ domain (LZ2: residues 816–843, Fig. 1 a) is positioned between splice site 2 and the conserved PKA consensus site at serine residue Ser-899 (see Fig.1 a). At least two further three-heptad repeats may also be present in the C terminus. To investigate whether LZ1 or LZ2 plays a functional role in targeting PKA to BK channels we examined the regulation of two distinct murine BK channel splice variants, STREX and ZERO, that are differentially regulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation when expressed in HEK293 cells (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). Two functional strategies were exploited, first, by designing competitive peptide inhibitors of LZ1 and LZ2 interactions in an attempt to disrupt PKA regulation of STREX and ZERO channels, respectively, and second, by investigating PKA-dependent regulation of STREX and ZERO channels in which candidate LZ1 motifs identified in the peptide inhibitor screen were disrupted by mutating the third and fourth d position leucine residues (Leu-530 and Leu-537) to alanine. Because the LZ1 domain is conserved in mammalian BK channels and distinct BK channel splice variants may be differentially regulated by PKA (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar), we addressed whether the LZ1 motif was required for regulation of distinct splice variants by endogenous PKA. To assay for regulation of BK channel splice variants by endogenous PKA we applied cAMP to the intracellular face of isolated inside-out patches from HEK293 cells to activate PKA closely associated with the channel as previously reported (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). The mouse ZERO variant of BK is activated by PKA closely associated with the channel and dependent upon a C-terminal serine residue (Ser-899) conserved in all mammalian BK channel splice variants (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar, 25Shipston M.J. Duncan R.R. Clark A.G. Antoni F.A. Tian L.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1728-1737Google Scholar). C-terminal HA-tagged ZERO channels were stimulated upon application of cAMP to the intracellular face of inside-out patches from HEK293 cells only in the presence of Mg-ATP (48.6 ± 8.0%, n = 8, Fig.2) in a similar fashion to untagged channels (17Tian L. Duncan R.R. Hammond S.L. Coghill L.C. Wen H. Rusinova R. Clark A.G. Levitan I.B. Shipston M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1717-1720Google Scholar). cAMP activation of ZERO channel activity was not observed in the presence of 25–80 μm LZ1 competing peptide (mean change in activity was −5.1 ± 14.7%,n = 8, Fig. 2). LZ1-competing peptide also blocked cAMP stimulation of the untagged channels (the mean change in activity was −1.9 ± 3.6%, n = 3). However, cAMP regulation of ZERO channels was unaffected by the alanine-substituted LZ1-competing peptide (the mean activation was 56.8 ± 14.6%,n = 4) or LZ2-competing peptide (the mean activation was 57.9 ± 8.9%, n = 4). Although the effect of the LZ1 peptide is specific, relatively high concentrations of peptide are required, LZ1 peptide concentrations <5 μm were largely ineffective (not shown). Thus, to confirm the requirement for a LZ1 domain in ZERO channel regulation by endogenous PKA, we mutated the third and fourth d position LZ1 leucine residues to alanine (ZEROL530A/L537A). This mutation had no significant effect on the half-maximal voltage required for channel activation (V 0.5) under the assay conditions;V 0.5 for the respective HA-tagged channels in the presence of 0.2 μm free calcium and Mg-ATP were 86 ± 7mV (n = 4) (ZERO) and 90 ± 10 mV (n = 3) (ZEROL530A/L537A). Importantly, ZEROL530A/L537A channels were unaffected by application of cAMP to their intracellular face (mean change in activity was 2.5 ± 5.6%, n = 6) (Fig. 2 b). To address whether mutation of the LZ1 motif prevents transduction of the effect of PKA-mediated phosphorylation of the mutant channel rather than preventing interaction of PKA with the channel, we applied the purified catalytic subunit of PKA (PKAc) to the intracellular face of patches containing ZEROL530A/L537A channels. Application of PKAc resulted in a 49.3 ±"

The purified enzyme had the characteristic requirement of basic lipids for catalytic activity. Analysis of the partial amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed that the purified β4GalT has a similar sequence to human β4GalT-IV. To confirm this result, we prepared cDNA for each of the seven β4GalTs cloned to date and examined substrate specificities using the membrane fractions derived from β4GalT-transfected COS-7 cells.

Hara-Kuge S. Yonezawa S. Nagata K. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 307-310Google Scholar). The enzyme preferred 6SGN and 6SGN-containing oligosaccharides to non-sulfated GlcNAc residues as acceptor substrates, whereas bovine milk β4GalT-I showed the opposite specificity. The Neu5Acα2→6GlcNAcβ1→ sequence was a poor substrate for the 6SGN-specific β4GalT, suggesting that a sulfate residue at the C-6 of GlcNAc is essential for the acceptor recognition.

Although the substrate specificities of these seven β4GalTs have been extensively studied, it remained unclear which enzymes can act on 6SGN residues in KS, N-linked, and O-linked glycans, and whether or not 6SGN-specific β4GalT is encoded by a novel gene. This issue is important for studying the biological roles of 6-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycans including KS and 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X. In this study, we first purified 6SGN-specific β4GalT from porcine colonic mucosa and partially determined its amino acid sequence. We obtained a sequence similar to human β4GalT-IV. Moreover, we isolated cDNA for each of the seven β4GalTs cloned to date, and we introduced expression vectors containing these cDNAs individually into COS-7 cells and prepared membrane fractions to study their substrate specificities. As a result, we found that among the seven β4GalTs, β4GalT-IV is the only enzyme to efficiently act on KS-related oligosaccharides and GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated core2, a precursor of 6-sulfosialyl-Lewis X.

The extract was dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20% glycerol (buffer A), and applied on a UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column (7 μmol/ml of gel; 2 × 10 cm; equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mmMnCl2, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol (buffer B)) (12Seko A. Hara-Kuge S. Yonezawa S. Nagata K. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 307-310Google Scholar). After washing with buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl, the enzyme fractions were eluted with buffer B containing 1 m NaCl and dialyzed against buffer A. Next, the dialysate was reapplied on a UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column (1.4 × 6.5 cm; equilibrated with buffer B) and eluted with buffer B containing 1 mmUDP. Each fraction was dialyzed against buffer A and assayed for β4GalT activity. The enzyme fractions were applied on an asialo-agalacto-ovomucin-Sepharose column (6.7 mg mucin/ml of gel; 1 × 7.5 cm; equilibrated with buffer B) (12Seko A. Hara-Kuge S. Yonezawa S. Nagata K. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 307-310Google Scholar). The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–0.2 m) in buffer B and then dialyzed. The enzyme fractions were concentrated and used for biochemical analyses. cDNAs encoding β4GalT-II, -III, -IV, -V, and -VII were amplified from SuperScriptTM human testis cDNA library (Invitrogen) by PCR, and cDNAs encoding β4GalT-I and -VI were amplified by PCR from QUICK-CloneTM cDNA for human colon adenocarcinoma and mouse brain (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), respectively. Oligonucleotide primers used for the PCRs were 5′-tttggatccTGTAGCCCACACC-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-I), 5′-tttgatatcAGGTCTCTTATCCGTG-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-I), 5′-tttggatccGGATGAGCAGACTGCTG-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-II), 5′-tttgatatcGTCCATTAGTGTCAGCC-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-II), 5′-tttggatccAGGATGTTGCGGAGGCT-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-III), 5′-tttgatatcGAGGAGTCAGTGTGAAC-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-III), 5′-tttggatccACATGGGCTTCAACCTG-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-IV), 5′-tttgatatcATCCAGGGTCATGCACC-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-IV), 5′-tttggatccTGGCTGCAGCATGC-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-V), 5′-tttgatatcTCAGTACTCGTTCAC-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-V), 5′-tttggatccGGAAGATGTCTGTGCTC-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-VI), 5′-tttgatatcCAGCATTGTGGTCTA-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-VI), 5′-tttggatccGCACGATGTTCCC-3′ (forward primer for β4GalT-VII), and 5′-tttgatatcCAGCTCAGCTGAATG-3′ (reverse primer for β4GalT-VII). Sequences in lowercase letters contain appropriate restriction sites. Amplified cDNAs were digested with BamHI andEcoRV and cloned between the respective sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The constructed plasmids were named pcDNA3-β4GalT-I, -II, -III, -IV, -V, -VI, and -VII, respectively, and these sequences were confirmed using an Applied Biosystems PRISM® 310 Genetic Analyzer (PE Biosystems). The plasmids (1 μg) were transfected into COS-7 cells on 35-mm dishes using Lipofectin Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 48 h, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped off the dishes in 10 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and 0.25 m sucrose, and homogenized. The homogenates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The precipitated crude membranes were suspended in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2) and kept at −80 °C until use. The 6-O-sulfation of the GlcNAc residue in core2-O-pNP was performed by GlcNAc6ST-1 (42Uchimura K. Muramatsu H. Kaname T. Ogawa H. Yamakawa T. Fan Q.-W. Mitsuoka C. Kannagi R. Habuchi O. Yokoyama I. Yamamura K. Ozaki T. Nakagawara A. Kadomatsu K. Muramatsu T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1998; 124: 670-678Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 ml of reaction mixture containing 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.8), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.1% (w/v) digitonin, 0.1m NaF, 2 mm Na2-ATP, 0.2 mm PAPS, 0.75 mm core2-O-pNP, and a membrane fraction prepared from GlcNAc6ST-1-expressing COS-7 cells (11Seko A. Nagata K. Yonezawa S. Yamashita K. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 379-388Google Scholar) (the specific activity was 8 nmol/h when using 1 mmcore2-O-pNP and 17 μm PAPS) was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h and subjected to paper electrophoresis. The product fractions were cut off and extracted with water. The extract was applied on a Sephadex G-25 column (1.4 × 68 cm, equilibrated and eluted with EtOH/water, 5:95 (v/v)). The sulfated oligosaccharide fractions were collected and concentrated. Finally, 150 nmol of 6S-core2-O-pNP was obtained. Twenty μl of reaction mixture consisting of 50 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.2), 10 mmMnCl2, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 250 μmUDP-Gal, 0.3 μm UDP-[3H]Gal (4.9 × 105 dpm), 0.5 mm acceptor substrate, and the membrane fraction approximately diluted was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. In the cases of purified porcine 6SGN-specific β4GalT, 0.5%(w/v) Triton X-100 was replaced by 0.001% (w/v)d-sphingosine and 0.05% (w/v) Triton X-100. The3H-labeled products derived from biGP, 6SGN, GL, Xyl-O-pNP, core2-O-pNP, 6S-core2-O-pNP, 6S-biGP, and KS were purified by paper electrophoresis (pyridine/acetic acid/water, 3:1:387, pH 5.4). The reaction mixtures in the case of agL2L2, agL2L4, and agLST-b were treated with 1 ml of 0.01 n HCl at 100 °C for 10 min, neutralized with 1 n NaOH, concentrated, and subjected to paper electrophoresis. The acid hydrolysis was necessary for the destruction of excess UDP-[3H]Gal, which moves to a similar position as 3H-galactosylated agL2L2 and agL2L4 and for removal of sialic acid residue in the case of agLST-b. After drying, in the cases of neutral substrates, the paper was further developed with a solvent system, pyridine/ethyl acetate/acetic acid/water (5:5:1:3). The paper was monitored for radioactivity with a radiochromatogram scanner, and the 3H-labeled products were extracted with water and applied on a RCA-I-agarose column (0.7 × 2.5 cm). Elution was started with 4 ml of 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.15 m NaCl, followed by the same buffer containing 10 mm lactose. The bound fractions (eluted with 10 mm lactose) or retarded fractions were collected and measured for radioactivity. In the case of GlcCer, the reaction mixtures were directly applied on a high performance TLC silica gel plate (Kieselgel 60 F254) (Merck) and developed with a solvent system (CHCl3/MeOH/0.2% CaCl2, 60:35:7). After drying, the plates were monitored for radioactivity, and the 3H-labeled products were extracted with CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) and counted. The membrane fraction derived from pcDNA3-transfected COS-7 cells (C-MF) was used as a control for intrinsic β4GalT activities. To calculate the amount of exogenous β4GalT activities, values of activities in C-MF were subtracted from those of apparent enzymatic activities obtained under the same conditions. Enzymatic activity values presented here were means of four independent experiments. Standard deviations were less than 5% in all cases. The concentration of KS was presented as moles of galactose. The protein concentrations were estimated using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye reagent with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Coomassie-stained bands in SDS-PAGE gels were excised and treated with 0.2 μg ofAchromobacter protease I (a gift from Dr. Masaki, Ibaraki University) (43Masaki T. Tanabe M. Nakamura K. Soejima M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 660: 44-50Google Scholar) at 37 °C for 12 h in 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 9.0) containing 0.1% SDS. Peptides generated were extracted from the gel and separated on columns of DEAE-5PW (2 × 20 mm; Tosoh, Tokyo) and Mightysil RP-18 (2 × 50 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo) connected in series with a model 1100 (Hewlett-Packard) liquid chromatography system. Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 0–60% solvent B, where solvents A and B were 0.09% (v/v) aqueous trifluoroacetic acid and 0.075% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid in 80%(v/v) acetonitrile, respectively. Selected peptides were subjected to Edman degradation using a model 477A automated protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) connected on-line to a model 120A PTH analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and to a Reflex matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen Analytik, Bremen, Germany) in linear mode using 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (44Xu N. Huang Z.H. Watson J.T. Gage D.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1997; 8: 116-124Google Scholar) as a matrix. Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot membranes (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNA content in each lane of the Northern blot membrane was normalized to the mRNA expression level of β-actin. 32P-Labeled probe was prepared from the cDNA fragment (excised from pcDNA3-β4GalT-IV by BamHI and EcoRV digestion) with a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Roche Diagnostics) using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were pre-hybridized in ExpressHyb Solution (Clontech) at 68 °C for 2 h and then hybridized with the 32P-labeled probe in the same solution at 68 °C for 16 h. The Northern blot membranes were washed in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature and then in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. The radioactivity was detected with FLA-2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., Tokyo). We showed previously (12Seko A. Hara-Kuge S. Yonezawa S. Nagata K. Yamashita K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 307-310Google Scholar) that a 6SGN-specific β4GalT exists in human colonic mucosa. To purify this enzyme and to isolate a corresponding cDNA based on partial amino acid sequences, we used porcine colonic mucosa as an enzyme source. Porcine colonic mucosa also contained 6SGN-specific β4GalT activity. When the enzyme was purified 2,300-fold by a second UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose column chromatography (TableI), the enzymatic activity disappeared (Fig. 1 A). Because such a loss of enzymatic activity has been reported for a glucuronyltransferase, which requires sphingomyelin for activity in a highly purified state (45Terayama K. Seiki T. Nakamura A. Matsumori K. Ohta S. Oka S. Sugita M. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30295-30300Google Scholar), we added various lipid compounds to the enzyme reaction mixtures. As shown in Table II, most of the phospholipids and ceramides had no ability to restore the enzymatic activity, whereas the activity appeared in the presence ofd-sphingosine and N,N-dimethylsphingosine. Stearylamine could also restore the activity, whereas octylamine could not, suggesting that basic, lipidous compounds with long hydrophobic chains are essential at least for the in vitro enzymatic activity. The minimum concentrations of d-sphingosine,N,N-dimethylsphingosine, and stearylamine giving the maximal activity were ∼10, 20, and 10 μm, respectively (Fig.2).Table IPurification of 6SGN-specific β4GaIT from porcine colonic mucosaStepTotal activity1-aThe activity was assayed using 6SGN as an acceptor substrate.ProteinSpecific activityYieldPurificationμmol/minmgμmol/min/mg%-foldMicrosome7.6269000.00111001Triton X-100 extract5.4634600.0016721.51st UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose2.27630.03630332nd UDP-hexanolamine-Sepharose2.501.02.5332300Asialo-agalacto-ovomucin-Sepharose1.330.05026.617240001-a The activity was assayed using 6SGN as an acceptor substrate.

We tried further purification by various chromatographic methods but were unsuccessful. The final enzyme fractions contained two major (45kDa and 42kDa) and two minor (59kDa and 52kDa) proteins as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 3). Each protein band was digested with a lysine-specific protease, and the peptide fragments were separated by reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography, and their amino acid sequence was analyzed. One or two peptide fragments from each band were sequenced (TableIII), and the sequences were compared with known protein sequences using the BLAST search system. The banda contained one sequence that is equal to that of human polypeptide:N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase-2 (46White T. Bennett E.P. Takio K. Sorensen T. Bonding N. Clausen H. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2001623646,"The mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of genomic imprinting are poorly understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that imprinting control regions (ICR) associated with the imprinted genes play an important role in creation of imprinted expression domains by propagating parent-of-origin-specific epigenetic modifications. We have recently documented that the Kcnq1ICR unidirectionally blocks enhancer-promoter communications in a methylation-dependent manner in Hep-3B and Jurkat cell lines. In this report we show that the Kcnq1 ICR harbors bidirectional silencing and methylation-sensitive methylation-spreading properties in a lineage-specific manner. We fine map both of these functions to two critical regions, and loss of one these regions results in loss of silencing as well as methylation spreading. The cell type-specific functions of the Kcnq1 ICR suggest binding of cell type-specific factors to various cis elements within the ICR. Fine mapping of the silencing and methylation-spreading functions to the same regions explains the fact that the silencing factors associated with this region primarily repress the neighboring genes and that methylation occurs as a consequence of silencing.

The distal end of the mouse chromosome 7 and an orthologous human chromosome 11p15.5 contain a well studied cluster of imprinted genes:Ipl, Orctl2, p57kip2,Kcnq1, Kcnq1 A-S/LIT1,Mash2, Ins2, Igf2, and H19 (1Paulsen M.

Miller W. Lehoczky J. Leung C. Birren B. Wheelan S. Dewar K. Feinberg A. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1697-1710Google Scholar). A differentially methylated region, located −2 to −4 kb upstream of the H19 gene, is involved in manifesting the imprinting of the Ins2, Igf2, andH19 genes by acting as an insulator element to the enhancers located 3′ of the H19 gene (3Kanduri C.

Most of the translocations in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients have been mapped to chromosome 11p15.5 (7Maher E. Reik W. J. Clin. Inv. 2000; 105: 247-252Google Scholar). Based on chromosomal break points and methylation changes in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome patients, an imprinting control region (KCNQ1 ICR) has been identified in intron 10 of the KCNQ1 gene (8Smilinich N.

The Kcnq1ICR 1The abbreviations used are: ICR, imprinting control regions; IGF2, insulin-like growth factor 2; R1, region 1; R2, region2. is methylated on the active maternal allele but unmethylated on the inactive paternal allele of the mouse Kcnq1 gene and overlaps an oppositely oriented and paternally expressed gene known as Kcnq1 A-S/LIT1(8Smilinich N.

Several lines of evidence suggest that this region is critical for regulation of imprinting of neighboring genes, Ipl,Slc22a1, Cdkn1c, Kcnq1,Tssc4, and Ascl2, thus meeting a criteria for being an imprinting control region (ICR) (10Horike S.

Genet. 2002; 32: 426-431Google Scholar). For example, the pivotal role of the Kcnq1 ICR in manifesting imprinting of neighboring genes has been confirmed by targeted deletion of this region in the human paternal chromosome 11 propagated in the chicken DT 40 cell line, which resulted in the activation of normally silent paternal alleles of KCNQ1 and CDNK1C (10Horike S. Mitsuya K. Meguro M. Kotobuki N. Kashiwagi A. Notsu T. Schulz T. Shirayoshi Y. Oshimura M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2075-2083Google Scholar). The role of the Kcnq1 ICR in vivo is further corroborated by a recent observation that paternal inheritance of the mouse chromosome 7 carrying a deletion of the 3.6-kb Kcnq1ICR resulted in the activation of the normally silent paternal alleles of Ipl, Slc22a1, Cdkn1c,Kcnq1, Tssc4, and Ascl2 (11Fitzpatrick G.V. Soloway P.D. Higgins M.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 426-431Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have documented that the Kcnq1 ICR unidirectionally blocks enhancer-promoter communications in a methylation-sensitive manner in Hep-3B and Jurkat cell lines (12Kanduri C. Fitzpatrick G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Higgins M. Ohlsson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18106-18110Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the Kcnq1 ICR bidirectionally silences reporter genes in an episomal-based system propagated in the JEG-3 cell line. Furthermore, this region also spreads DNA methylation over the H19 reporter gene in a methylation-sensitive manner. We have fine mapped both of these functions to two regions within the Kcnq1 ICR, and deletion of one of these regions resulted in loss of silencing as well as methylation-spreading properties of the Kcnq1 ICR. To facilitate cloning of the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragment and its serial deletions into episomal plasmids, we inserted a fragment with multiple cloning sites from the parent pREP4 plasmid (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar) (amplified using forward primer AAGCTGATCTATCATGTCTGGATCCGGCC and reverse primer, AAGCTGATCCATTCACCACATTGGTGTGC flanked with either SalI or ClaI sites at their 5′ ends) into a uniqueSalI (with the SV40 enhancer in the ClaI site) and ClaI (with the SV40 enhancer in the SalI site) sites of pREPH19 A and C (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar). The 3.6-kbNotI-XhoI Kcnq1 ICR fragment was subcloned into the NotI-XhoI sites of multiple cloning fragment at the SalI and ClaI positions. An opposite orientation of the Kcnq1 ICR at theSalI and ClaI positions was achieved by subcloning a NotI fragment of the Kcnq1 ICR into the NotI site of the multiple cloning site. Cloning of the serial deletion fragments of the 3.6-kb fragment into episomes was carried out by PCR amplifying the 1.9-kb, 1.6-kb, 1.5-kb, and 1.25-kb fragments using primers flanked with unique Kpn1 restriction site to the forward primer and XhoI restriction site to the reverse primer at their 5′ end and inserting the PCR fragments into KpnI and XhoI sites of the multiple cloning site at the SalI position. The 1.9-kb fragment was PCR amplified using a forward primer 5′-TATAGGTACCGTACAAGCTCACCCAATCCA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TATACTCGAGCAGGTCTCAACGTGTGGGTCG-3′. The 1.6-kb fragment was amplified using a forward primer 5′-TATAGGTACCCCGCCTCATTTTGGATTACT-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TATACTCGAGCAGGTCTCAACGTGTGGGTCG-3′. The 1.6-kb fragment was PCR amplified using a forward primer 5′-TATAGGTACC GTACAAGCTCACCCAATCCA-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TATACTCGAGAGAGCTAGATCACAACTCGG. The 1.3-kb fragment was amplified using a forward primer 5′-TATAGGTACC GTACAAGCTCACCCAATCCA-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-TATACTCGAGTCGACCGACCTCGGGGCTCA-3′. The cloning of these fragments in the opposite orientation at the SalI position was done by flanking the NotI site to forward and reverse primers and screening for the opposite orientation. The pREP4-based episomal vectors were transfected into Hep3B and JEG-3 cells, as has been described (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar). The RNase protection expression analysis was performed as previously described using a 365-bpH19 antisense probe and a 150-bp glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antisense probe as control (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar). 10 μg of RNA (including various amounts of total cell RNA depending on episome copy number and yeast tRNA) was hybridized with the antisense probes (300,000 cpm/reaction for H19 and 20,000 cpm/reaction for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) overnight at 45 °C. All procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol of the RPAIII kit (Ambion). Quantification of individual protected fragments was done using a Fuji FLA 3000 Phosphorimager. TheH19 expression was corrected with respect to both internal control (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and episome copy number as determined by Southern blot analysis of BglII restricted DNA, hybridized with H19 (probe 4) andPDGFB (probe 3) probes (3Kanduri C.

To assess the Kcnq1 ICR-mediated bidirectional silencing on hygromycin- and neomycin-resistance genes, equimolar concentrations of episomal plasmids containing the various portions of theKcnq1 ICR were transfected into JEG-3 cells. After transfection, the cells were selected with 750 μg of G418 and 150 μg of hygromycin until all of the cells in the control plate died. After selection, the drug-resistant colonies were stained with hemotoxylin and counted. A purifiedKcnq1 ICR 3.6-kb fragment was methylated with 2 units/μgSssI methyltransferase in the presence of 180 μm S-adenosyl methionine for 16 h at 37 °C. The methylation reaction was terminated by heat-inactivation at 65 °C for 15 min, and the methylation status of the purified fragment was analyzed by digestion with HhaI. The mock-methylated fragment was treated in the same way without the addition of SssI. After linearization of pREPH19A withXhoI and NotI, the methylated and mock-methylated ICR fragments were ligated within the vector overnight at 14 °C. Each ligation mix was then phenol:chloroform-extracted (1:1) and used directly for transfection. Hygromycin-selected clones were individually harvested, and cells from each clone were equally divided for DNA and RNA extraction. DNA was extracted by lysing the cells overnight with 1% SDS supplemented with Proteinase K (50 μg/ml). DNA was then purified with phenol:chloroform (1:1) extraction. The RNA was extracted with an RNA kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturers recommendations. For genotyping, DNA from cell clones was restricted with BstBI/BstZ17I, and for methylation analysis the DNA was digested with PstI and HhaI and analyzed by standard Southern blot hybridization protocols (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar) using probe 2, a 3.6-kb PstI fragment covering the entireKcnq1 ICR. Probe 1 comprises a 2.4-kb BamHI fragment encompassing promoter and coding regions of the H19 gene. Probe 2 comprises a 3.6-kb Kcnq1 fragment covering episomal vector sequences containing the hygromycin gene. Probe 3 is aBglII fragment covering the intron portion of the humanPDGF gene and probe 4 is a linearized fragment of pREP4H19 A. Twenty μg of digested DNA was restricted with restriction enzymes and electrophoresed on a 1.7% gel and blotted to a Hybond N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) followed by hybridization with probes according to standard protocols. All probe fragments were radiolabeled using a multi-prime labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and [α-32P]dCTP. Bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA extracted from episomal plamids inserted with Kcnq1 ICR in PS4 and NSII orientation, transfected into Hep-3B cells and propagated for 42 days, was carried out as described earlier (13Liang L. Kanduri C. Pilartz M. Svensson K. Song J.H. Wentzel P. Eriksson U. Ohlsson R. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 44: 785-790Google Scholar). The PCR product was amplified from the bisulfite-treated DNA using forward primer 5′-AAATGTTGGGAGTATTAGGTTGTTTTTTT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AAAAACCATACAAAAAAAAACACACTAAA-3′ from region 1(R1). The amplified product was cloned into pGEMT Easy vector (Promega) and subsequently sequenced with BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit. Because the imprinting of Kcnq1 and neighboring genes is tissue-specifically regulated, we were interested in knowing whether the Kcnq1 ICR function depends on the cell type used. For this purpose we chose the trophectodermally derived cell line, JEG-3. We have used an episomal based system, which comprises the SV40 enhancer and the H19 gene as a reporter gene that can discriminate between the silencing and insulating properties. We have inserted the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR into both insulating (SalI position, between the SV40 enhancer and theH19 reporter gene promoter) and silencing (ClaI position, out of the SV40 enhancer and the H19 promoter context) positions in the episomal plasmids, pREP4H19A and pREP4H19C (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar), and these plasmids were transfected into JEG-3 cells. The RNA extracted from these samples was subjected to RNase protection analysis after transiently propagating for 9 days in cell culture and adjusted for episome copy numbers as has been described (3Kanduri C. Holmgren C. Franklin G. Pilartz M. Ullerås E. Kanduri M. Liu L. Ginjala V. Ulleras E. Mattsson R. Ohlsson R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 449-457Google Scholar). Fig.1 B shows that when the Kcnq1 ICR was positioned in the PS4 orientation (in this orientation, the antisense transcript emanating from the Kcnq1 ICR faces toward the H19 promoter; see Fig. 1 A) at the insulating position, the reporter gene activity was reduced 10-fold. We have observed 7-fold reduction in the reporter gene activity, however, when we inserted the Kcnq1 ICR in the opposite (NSII) orientation, suggesting the fact that the Kcnq1 ICR down-regulated the activity of the mouse H19 reporter gene in an orientation-independent manner at the insulating position. We next addressed whether the observed silencing is a consequence of silencing rather than insulating by analyzing the steady-state levels of the H19 transcripts in episomal plasmids withKcnq1 ICR inserted at the silencing position (i.e. outside the reporter gene enhancer context). As can be seen in Fig. 1 B, constructs with the Kcnq1 ICR in PC3 orientation showed more than a 10-fold reduction in the reporter gene activity. Conversely, the Kcnq1 ICR did not modify reporter gene activity in the opposite orientation, LC2. Down-regulation of the H19 transcripts at the insulator and silencing positions suggests that the Kcnq1 ICR acts as a silencer rather than insulator in JEG-3 cells. Orientation-dependent silencing by the Kcnq1 ICR at the silencing position, however, reveals that the KcnqI ICR may be harboring both silencer and insulator elements. Because the Kcnq1 ICR is involved in bidirectional repression of neighboring genes in vivo, we wished to recapitulate a similar scenario using our episomal-based approach. TheKcnq1 ICR at the insulating position, that is, between the SV40 enhancer and the H19 reporter gene, is flanked with theH19 and hygromycin genes. Above, we have analyzed the effect of the Kcnq1 ICR on the H19 reporter gene by RNase protection analysis. The effect of the Kcnq1 ICR on the hygromycin gene activity was measured by counting the number of hygromycin-resistant colonies. As shown in Fig. 1 B the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR down-regulated the activity of the hygromycin gene about 10-fold in the PS4 orientation. TheKcnq1 ICR in the NS11 orientation also down-regulated the hygromycin gene activity, albeit to a lesser extent. These observations taken together suggest that the Kcnq1 ICR silences the reporter genes bidirectionally in our episomal context, thereby mimicking the in vivo situation. Because our episomal approach recapitulates the bidirectional silencing property that is observed in vivo, we sought to fine map the regions responsible for the silencing feature. To this end, we have created several serial deletions within the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, we recapitulated the silencing property of the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR with the 1.9-kb fragment, a smaller version of the 3.6-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragment. Deletions within the 1.9-kb the Kcnq1 ICR fragment revealed two regions, region 1(R1) and region 2 (R2), that are involved in bidirectional silencing. Removal of the 300-bp fragment comprising R1 resulted in complete loss of silencing activity. On the other hand, removal of the 600-bp R2 from the 1.9-kb fragment yielded ∼70% activation from the reporter genes. These studies suggest that both R1 and R2 are critical for achieving 100% efficient silencing and loss of one of the regions results in loss of silencing. The bidirectional silencing activity of the Kcnq1 ICR was further tested using an episomal based system equipped with neomycin and hygromycin resistance genes as reporter genes under the control of the SV40 enhancer (Fig. 1 C). We measured the effect of theKcnq1 ICR on the reporter genes by counting neomycin- and hygromycin- resistant colonies. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the 3.6-kb and 1.9-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragments at the insulating position bidirectionally silence both reporter genes in an orientation-independent manner. The serial deletions within the 1.9-kbKcnq1 ICR fragment also uncovered that R1 and R2 are required for efficient bidirectional silencing. Taken together, these data suggest that the Kcnq1 ICR silences the reporter genes bidirectionally in an orientation-independent manner at the insulating position in JEG-3 cells. We could not carry out the methylation sensitivity of the bidirectional silencer activity of theKcnq1 ICR in JEG-3 cells because episomal plasmids become heavily de novo-methylated in short-term cultures (14Kanduri C. Kanduri M. Liu L. Thakur N. Pfeifer S. Ohlsson R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4545-4548Google Scholar). Having fine mapped the regions responsible for bidirectional repression in the Kcnq1 ICR, we next sought to understand the mechanisms underlying the bidirectional repression. Because DNA methylation is linked to gene silencing, we presumed thatKcnq1 ICR silences the reporter genes by spreading DNA methylation over the neighboring sequences. We therefore analyzed DNA methylation of the regions flanking the Kcnq1 ICR on episomal plasmids collected at various time points from the transiently propagated JEG-3 cells and long term-propagated Hep-3B cells (Fig.2 A) to check the role of DNA methylation in the Kcnq1 ICR-mediated silencing. As can be seen in Fig. 2, B–D, the 3.6-kb Kcnq1ICR spreads DNA methylation in the PS4 orientation over the H19 reporter gene in JEG-3 and Hep-3b cells. The Kcnq1 ICR, however, did not spread DNA methylation over the H19 reporter gene in the NSII orientation to the extent that has been noticed with theKcnq1 ICR in the PS4 orientation (Fig. 2 D). Taken together, the data suggest that the Kcnq1 ICR spreads DNA methylation in a orientation-specific manner. We next addressed whether this de novo methylation spreading is unique to the Kcnq1 ICR or is a common feature among the other imprinting control regions by transiently transfecting the episomal plasmids containing the H19 ICR and theKcnq1 ICR. We initiated this assay by using JEG-3 cells, which show high de novo methylation property on transfected episomal plasmids (15Zwart R. Sleutels F. Wutz A. Schinkel A.H. Barlow D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2361-2366Google Scholar). Fig. 2 C shows that theKcnq1 ICR but not the H19 ICR caused de novo methylation spreading. Because we have earlier shown that the insulator activity of the Kcnq1 ICR is CpG methylation-sensitive in the Hep-3B cell line (12Kanduri C. Fitzpatrick G. Mukhopadhyay R. Kanduri M. Lobanenkov V. Higgins M. Ohlsson R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18106-18110Google Scholar), we were interested in knowing whether CpG methylation has any role in the de novo methylation spreading property of the Kcnq1 ICR. Paradoxically, the methylated Kcnq1 ICR inserted into the episome abrogated the de novo methylation spreading that is observed in the unmethylated version of the Kcnq1 ICR, suggesting that the de novo methylation spreading property of the Kcnq1 ICR is CpG methylation-sensitive (Fig.2 E). Serial deletion experiments within the Kcnq1 ICR revealed R1 and R2 regions that are together responsible for bidirectional silencing activity. Methylation analysis on the episomes containing these serial deletions (Fig. 3 A) transiently transfected into JEG-3 cells was carried out assuming that the methylation-spreading regions may also fine map to R1 and R2. Fig.3 B shows that methylation-spreading properties were recapitulated in the 1.9-kb fragment of the Kcnq1 ICR. Removal of 400 bp from the 1.9-kb fragment (PS4 1.5 and NSII 1.5) resulted in bidirectional methylation spreading, suggesting the 400-bp region may contain signals for orientation specificity. Further loss of 200 bp from the 1.5-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragment resulted in loss of methylation spreading (Fig. 3, A and B). Methylation spreading was also not seen when the 300-bp R1 was deleted from the 1.9-kb Kcnq1 ICR fragment, revealing that both R1 and R2 are crucial for de novo methylation spreading. Moreover, these data suggest that the factors associated with R1 and R2 probably perform both silencing and methylation-spreading functions. It is generally perceived that the protein factors associated with cis elements protect its own sequences from de novo methylation. We were therefore interested in addressing whether or not the cis elements in the Kcnq1 ICR would protect de novomethylation spreading. As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, the Kcnq1 ICR was protected from its own de novo methylation-spreading property in the PS4 orientation. Surprisingly, however, the Kcnq1 ICR was methylated in the NSII orientation. The latter observation was also noticed on transiently transfected episomes in JEG-3 cells, although there was cell type specificity in de novo methylation of various CpGs when compared with the Hep-3B cell line. Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the CpGs in the R1 of the Kcnq1 ICR on the DNA, extracted from PS4 and NSII episomal plasmids transfected into Hep-3B cells propagated for 42 days, also revealed thatKcnq1 ICR is unmethylated in the PS4 orientation but methylated in the NSII orientation (Fig. 4 C). The Kcnq1 ICR, which is methylated on the maternal allele and unmethylated on the paternal allele, has been implicated in the long range control of imprinted gene expression at the distal end of the mouse chromosome 7. The bidirectional silencing property of theKcnq1 ICR in the JEG-3 cell type at the insulating position in episomal context explains the recent observation that targeted deletion of the mouse Kcnq1 ICR on the maternal chromosome bidirectionally activates neighboring genes (11Fitzpatrick G.V. Soloway P.D. Higgins M.J. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 426-431Google Scholar). However, the orientation-independent repression at the insulator position and the orientation-dependent repression at the silencing position by the Kcnq1 ICR in episomes in JEG-3 cells suggests that this fragment contains both silencing and insulator elements. The orientation-dependent insulator activity by theKcnq1 ICR in Hep-3b and Jurkat cell line reveals the cell type-specific complexity of the regulatory mechanisms that are operated by the various cis elements in the Kcnq1 ICR (Fig.5 A). The cell type-specific functions of the Kcnq1 ICR reflects the suggestion that the DNA-binding factors associate with the Kcnq1 ICR tissue-specifically to confer cell type-specific functions. Orientation-dependent, methylation-sensitive methylation spreading appears to be a consequence rather than cause of silencing by the Kcnq1 ICR, because the silencing of the reporter genes by the Kcnq1 ICR proceeds well before the de novomethylation-spreading property of the Kcnq1 ICR. For example, in Hep-3B cells, the silencing of the reporter gene by theKcnq1 ICR is observed 9 days after transfection, however,de novo methylation occurs after 15 days of transfection, suggesting that de novo methylation of reporter genes is a consequence of silencing. Interestingly, in JEG-3 cells methylation spreading is observed in the PS4 orientation of the Kcnq1ICR, in which pronounced silencing of the reporter gene is observed, but not in the NSII orientation. This observation suggests thatde novo methylation spreading occurs only during efficient silencing conditions. More strikingly, de novomethylation-spreading and silencing properties of the Kcnq1ICR map to the same regions, R1 and R2, suggesting that the silencing factors associated with the R1 and R2 regions may directly or indirectly recruit methyltransferases to this region. The bidirectional silencing property of the Kcnq1 ICR in JEG-3 cells is synonymous to what has been documented with theIgf2r ICR (15Zwart R. Sleutels F. Wutz A. Schinkel A.H. Barlow D.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2361-2366Google Scholar) because both ICRs are associated with antisense transcripts. It has recently been proposed that the antisense transcript, Air, originating from the Igf2r ICR plays a critical role in the imprinting of neighboring genes by bidirectionally silencing. It has been proposed that the Air transcript bidirectionally silences neighboring genes by initially repressing theIgf2r promoter on the overlapping side by forming repressive chromatin structure, and this gradually spreads to the other side of the ICR, thereby inactivating genes bidirectionally (16Sleutels F. Zwart R. Barlow D.P. Nature. 2002; 415: 810-813Google Scholar). Byin vivo footprinting analysis, we have been able to uncover several cis elements required for the basal promoter in the R1 of theKcnq1 ICR (data not shown). By analogy, in theKcnq1 ICR, the antisense transcript originating from R1 could interact with R2 to form a repressive chromatin structure, which later spreads to bidirectionally inactivate genes. Alternatively, the dsRNA derived from the Kcnq1-AS/Kcnq1 transcripts might trigger RNA interference, with ensuing methylation of histone H3 lysine 9, as has been documented in case of the centromeric region of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe(17Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Google Scholar). Histone modification would then signal DNA methylation to stabilize repressive chromatin structures. The repressive chromatin structure, although initially formed on theKcnq1-AS/Kcnq1 overlapping side, might then spread to other side gradually (Fig. 5 B). The present investigation documents that the Kcnq1 ICR employs multiple, lineage-specific mechanisms to developmentally manifest the imprinted state of the neighboring genes (Fig.5 A). The methylation-sensitive spreading of methylation by the Kcnq1 ICR explains the paradox of why the loss of methylation in Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome/Wilm's tumor patients at the maternal KCNQ1 ICR results in spreading of methylation at the neighboring sequences, leading to pathological inactivation of neighboring genes (18Engel J. Smallwood A. Harper A. Higgins M. Oshimura M. Reik W. Schofield P. Maher E. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 37: 921-926Google Scholar). We acknowledge valuable advice and help by Prof. Rolf Ohlsson."

These cells express receptors to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), a cytokine with proapoptotic properties implicated in the resolution of GN. Progression to proliferative GN is accompanied by cyclooxygenase-mediated formation of prostaglandins and inefficient apoptosis of mesangial cells. The aims of this study were to quantify TNFα-mediated apoptosis in renal mesangial cells and to determine whether expression of the inducible form of cyclooxygenase, cylooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inhibits this apoptosis. By 24 h significant levels of apoptosis were induced by TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide control (100 μm), as shown by phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, development of a sub-G0/G1 region, and distinct chromatin condensation. Using adenoviral-mediated delivery of the COX-2 gene (AdCOX-2) apoptotic features were prevented from appearing in AdCOX-2 cells treated with TNFα, whereas etoposide-treated AdCOX-2 cells were not protected. Furthermore, COX-2 expression, induced by the vasoconstrictor peptide ET-1 or the cytokine interleukin-1β also inhibited TNFα-mediated but not etoposide-mediated apoptosis, to an extent, similar to adenoviral COX-2 infection. Selective COX-2 inhibition by NS-398 restored TNFα-mediated apoptosis. Prostaglandin (PG) E2 and PGI2 were shown to be the major prostaglandin metabolites in AdCOX-2 cells. The addition of PGE2 and PGI2protected against TNFα-mediated apoptosis.

Importantly mesangial cells undergo a change in phenotype during glomerular inflammation in which they become proliferative and matrix-secreting myofibroblasts before they are eliminated by apoptosis (2Pfeilschifter J.

In the glomeruli of patients experiencing acute glomerular inflammation, referred to as glomerular nephritis (GN),1 apoptotic bodies were detected as a compensatory response, instigated to counterbalance mesangial hypercellularity thereby permitting normal structure and function to return (8Harrison D.J. Histopathology. 1988; 12: 679-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Mesangial/myofibroblast apoptosis was also identified in the rat in vivo model of experimental GN, anti-Thy1.1 nephritis (7Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 9Bagchus W.M. Hoedemaeker P.J. Rozing J. Bakker W.W. Lab.

Proliferative forms of GN are characterized by a dysregulation of mesangial cell apoptosis allowing a chronic secretion of proinflammatory stimuli and prostaglandins (PG), which leads to an excess deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, post-inflammatory scarring, and renal failure (7Baker A.J. Mooney A. Hughes J. Lombardi D. Johnson R.J. Savill J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 10.Shimizu, A., Masuda, Y., Kitamura, H., Ishizaki, M., Sugisaki, Y., and Yamanaka, N. (1996) 74, 941–951.Google Scholar). Proliferative GN remains a leading cause of end-stage renal failure (11Kluth D.C. Rees A.J. Nephrology. 1999; 12: 66-75Google Scholar). Consequently, to avoid progression of glomerular inflammatory disease it is important to define the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of mesangial cell apoptosis. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an inducible form of cyclooxygenase involved in chronic inflammation (12Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2473) Google Scholar, 13Hla T. Ristimaki A. Appleby S. Barriocanal J.G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 696: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Several studies have highlighted an up-regulation of COX-2 expression in proliferative GN (14Dubois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L.

Wilson C.B. Arakawa M. Kihara I. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1998; 9: 408-416PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise role of COX-2 has not been investigated. It is plausible that COX-2 is responsible for the progression of proliferative GN by an anti-apoptotic mechanism. A growing body of evidence that COX-2 has an anti-apoptotic role in the pathogenesis of epithelial cell carcinomas, in particular colorectal cancer, supports this hypothesis (16Cao Y. Prescott S.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). An overexpression of COX-2 conferred a survival advantage in rat intestinal epithelial cells by inhibiting apoptosis (17Tsuji M. Kawano S.S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. Dubois R.N.

Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). Within the inflamed glomerulus, TNFα is produced locally by mesangial and epithelial cells as well as by infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (20Takemura T. Yoshioka K. Murakami K. Akano N. Okada M. Aya N. Maki S. Virchows Arch. 1994; 424: 459-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). TNFα alone may be a key component for the resolution phase of glomerular inflammation and may enhance death receptor initiated-apoptosis of mesangial cells by an autocrine and/or paracrine mechanism. TNFα can also stimulate the release of other proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1β (21Vassalli P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 411-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 22Sterzel R.B. Schulze-Lohoff E. Marx M. Kidney Int. 1993; 43: S26-S31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Endothelins, particularly ET-1, are mitogenic to mesangial cells in vivoand may act in concert with other vasoconstrictor peptides or cytokines to promote glomerular inflammation (23Simonson M.S.

TNFα alone had little effect on COX-2 but the combination of TNFα plus IL-1β dramatically increased COX-2 expression (28Coyne D.W. Nickols M. Beryrand W. Morrison A.R. Am. J.

The contribution of TNFα may depend on its mediation of either one of two conflicting pathways; cell survival via activation of NF-κB (30Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar) or caspase-mediated apoptosis (30Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 31Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5166) Google Scholar). In previous studies of RMC apoptosis, sensitivity to TNFα could only be achieved in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D, to prevent synthesis of survival factors (32Guo Y.L. Baysal K. Kang B. Yang L.J. Williamson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4027-4034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) or by a specific inhibition of NF-κB (33Sugiyama H.

The overall objective of this study was to determine whether COX-2 expression inhibits apoptosis in RMC. Because mesangial cells express TNFα receptors and represent a potential route of apoptosis induction in the resolution of proliferative GN, we evaluated the extent of this apoptosis, and its inhibition by COX-2. We first established a suitable cell culture model in which TNFα-mediated apoptosis was measured in multiple apoptosis assays. We then used two different methods to induce COX-2 expression, i.e. induction by ET-1, or IL-1β, and forced expression using adenoviral-mediated gene transfer. We also investigated the effects of PGE2 and PGI2 on TNFα-mediated apoptosis, after establishing that those PGs were the major PG metabolites generated by COX-2 overexpression. Using these multiple approaches combined with several apoptosis assays, an anti-apoptotic effect of COX-2 on TNFα-mediated apoptosis was conclusively demonstrated in renal mesangial cells. Recombinant IL-1β was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant ET-1 was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Annexin V and the caspase-3 apoptosis assay detection kits were purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Boston, MA) and BD Pharmingen, respectively. NS398 was obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). RPMI 1640 medium and fetal bovine serum were from Invitrogen. Polyclonal goat and polyclonal rabbit anti-COX-2 (N-20) and bcl-2 (N-19) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat and goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins (IgGs) were from Bio-Rad. Protein was determined by a BCA assay from Pierce (Rockford, IL). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Flow cytometry experiments were carried out using a BD Biosciences FACS calibur (Mountain View, CA). In all experiments 10,000 live cells, based on light scatter properties, were gated and analyzed using Cell Quest Software (BD Biosciences). Primary glomerular mesangial cells from male Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated and characterized as previously described (35Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Foschi M. Chari S. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6439-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RMC were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 17% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 5 μg/ml each of insulin and transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air). All experiments were performed with cells cultured in 60-mm dishes and used at 8–20 passages. After the cells were grown to ∼60% confluence they were starved for 24 h in basal RPMI 1640 culture medium before the experiments. The recombinant adenoviral vectors (Ad) AdCOX-2 and Ad wild-type (AdWT) expressing the COX-2 and empty adenovirus vector, respectively, were constructed from the replication-deficient adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) as previously described (37Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). RMC were incubated with AdCOX-2 or AdWT (at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 200) for 1 h at 37 °C with periodic shaking, followed by addition of complete medium. At 24 h after infection, cells were lysed for Western blot analysis. Efficiency of gene transfer in RMC was determined by adenoviral infection of green fluorescent protein at an m.o.i. of 200 and visualized by fluorescence microscopy at 24 h. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then harvested in lysis buffer as previously described (35Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 187: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cleared total cell lysates (20–40 μg) were resolved by criterion SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Micron Separation Inc.). Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining the membranes with Ponceau S, which stains all the proteins on the membrane; an intensely stained band of a distinct molecular weight sufficiently different from the protein under investigation was selected from each membrane, to show that the amount of protein in each lane was identical. Membranes were probed with either COX-2 (1:1000 dilution) or bcl-2 (1:300 dilution) antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugates for bcl-2identification or anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase antibodies for COX-2 detection (1:2000 dilution), followed by extensive washing of the membranes. The membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). RMC were infected with AdCOX-2 or AdWT as described above, but in this instance the conditioned medium was replaced with new basal medium devoid of any previously formed PGs. After the 24-h infection period, the supernatants were collected and the cell monolayers were washed twice with a HEPES-buffered medium (pH 7.4) and were incubated in this buffer containing the calcium ionophoreA23187 (10 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C (38Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 23 (11660–11666): 274Google Scholar). The total cell lysates were run on a solid phase extraction device for analysis of PGE2, PGI2 (detected as 6-keto-PGF1α, a stable product of PGI2), PGF2a, PGJ2, and PGD2 prior to measurement by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (39Nithipatikom K. Grall A.J. Holmes B.B. Harder D.R. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Internal standards, 1.0 ng each ofd 4-PGE2,d 4-PGF2α,d 4-6-keto-PGF1α,d 4-PGD2, ord 4-PGJ2, were added to the samples followed by ethanol, to give a final concentration of 15% in the samples. Glacial acetic acid (10 μl/ml) was then added. The samples were sonicated and vortexed three times before centrifugation at 300 × g, at room temperature for 5 min. The supernatants were loaded onto the solid phase extraction columns (C18Bond Elut SPE columns) that had been preconditioned with 5 ml of ethanol and 15 ml of water. The columns were washed with 29 ml of water and allowed to run dry. Then the PGs were eluted from the column with 6 ml of ethyl acetate. A vacuum was applied to a completely dry column. The top layer of ethyl acetate was removed from the water layer at the bottom of the reaction tubes. The compounds of interest were in the ethyl acetate layer. The water layer was extracted twice with 1 ml of ethyl acetate. The resulting two ethyl acetate portions were combined for each sample and dried under a stream of nitrogen gas until completely dry. The sample was then redissolved in 20 μl of acetonitrile and transferred to an insert in the sample vial. The derivatized extracts were subject to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry using LC-ESI-MS (Agilent 1100 LC/MSD, SL model) (39Nithipatikom K. Grall A.J. Holmes B.B. Harder D.R. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 298: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the different PGs were evaluated by comparing their ratios of peak areas to the standard curves. Results were expressed as picograms per milligram of protein per dish. RMC infected with AdWT or AdCOX-2 (m.o.i. of 200) for 24 h were incubated with TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm). After treatment, cells were morphologically assessed for apoptosis by acridine orange (AO) staining using inverted fluorescence microscopy. The cell monolayers were washed in PBS and incubated with AO in PBS (10 μg/ml) for ≈2 min. Typically 3 fields were randomly selected from each 60-mm dish so that at least 80 RMC were counted. All cells produced a green fluorescence in response to a high affinity binding of AO to DNA. Apoptotic green cells were scored by their distinct morphology of cellular shrinkage and chromatin condensation. Attached apoptotic cells were scored as a percentage of the total number of cells counted for each dish. RMCs (5 × 105 cells) infected with either AdWT or AdCOX-2 were incubated with TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm). At the end of the incubation time the supernatants were collected. The remaining cell monolayer was washed in Hanks' buffered saline solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and then incubated in a solution of trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by addition of basal media. The trypsinized cells were then added to the previously collected culture supernatants. This cell suspension was centrifuged at 179 × g, 4 °C, for 5 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged again at 179 × g, 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Cells fixed in ethanol were stored at −20 °C for up to 3 days. The cells were precipitated from the ethanol by high-speed centrifugation at 358 × g, 4 °C, for 15 min. The pellet was resuspended in PBS and centrifuged again at 358 × g, 4 °C, for 15 min. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of RNase A (prepared in PBS without Mg2+ or Ca2+ and heat treated to inactivate DNase) to give a final concentration of 250 μg/ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. At the end of the incubation propidium iodide (PI) (1 mg/ml) was added to give a final concentration of 50 μg/ml. The suspension was incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. The cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry. RMCs (5 × 105 cells) infected with either AdWT or AdCOX-2 were treated with TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm) and stained with annexin-V (AV) labeled to FITC in combination with PI, for FACS analysis of apoptosis. FITC-AV/PI staining was optimized for attached cells according to the instructions outlined by the manufacturers of the AV assay kit (Oncogene Research Products). FITC conjugated to a monoclonal rabbit antibody raised against the active fragment of caspase-3 was also used to determine apoptosis in AdWT or AdCOX-2 cells treated with either TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm), following cell permeabilization and fixation according to the instructions outlined by the manufacturer. FITC-AV/PI and active-caspase-3-FITC staining was also carried out on cells stimulated to express COX-2 by the addition of ET-1 (100 nm) or IL-1β (2 ng/ml) and on cells treated with either PGE2 (500 nm) or PGI2 (500 nm) to investigate the effects of these various treatments on TNFα- (100 ng/ml) or etoposide- (100 μm) mediated apoptosis. For PG addition, conditioned media was removed and replaced with fresh basal media to ensure removal of any existing PGs. PGs were readministered after 6 and 12 h of co-incubation with the apoptotic inducers to replenish depleted PGs. Effect of NS398 (25 μm) on ET-1 protection of apoptosis was also assessed by these assays. Control cells received Me2SO at the same concentration and time of incubation as PGE2 (500 nm) and NS398 (25 μm). Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated a transient overexpression of COX-2 in SV40-transformed human mesangial cells using an adenovirus-mediated transfer of COX-2 cDNA (37Chang Y.W. Jakobi R. McGinty A. Foschi M. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8571-8579Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this study the AdCOX-2 construct was used to express COX-2 in rat primary RMC. The transgenic AdGFP construct showed ≈100% transfection efficiency in RMC at 24 h postadenoviral infection, as visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.1 B), compared with uninfected control cells (Fig. 1 A). The ability of the virus to infect the cell is governed by specific cell receptors, and this infection process is not specific to the gene insert. Therefore AdGFP is a suitable control that can be used for assessing the level of expression by adenovirus-mediated gene delivery (40Patel V.A. Dunn M.J. Sorokin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38915-38920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis confirmed COX-2 protein expression, which was enhanced by a dose-dependent increase in AdCOX-2 after 24 h of infection (Fig. 1 C). Certain regions of the kidney contain a higher constitutive expression of COX-2 than most tissues, however, mesangial cells are normally devoid of COX-2 (41Harris R.C. Breyer M.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F1-F11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uninfected RMC and RMC infected with the AdWT construct did not reveal any detectable COX-2 (Fig. 1 C). In addition, we checked for anti-apoptotic bcl-2 protein in our system because an overexpression of COX-2 in colon cancer cells was accompanied by bcl-2 protein expression (18Shao J. Sheng H. Inove H. Morrow J.D. Dubois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 19Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. Dubois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). However, we could not detect bcl-2 in RMC transfected with AdWT or AdCOX-2 (Fig. 1 D). Our first task was to develop an apoptosis model in RMC cultures. To conclusively demonstrate the elicitation of apoptotic cell death by a cytokine/receptor-mediated route, the effect of TNFα was compared with a cytotoxic insult using the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, which readily induces classic apoptotic changes such as phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization in different cell types. We found that TNFα at a dose of 100 ng/ml induced a time-dependent increase in apoptotic cells, which became significant by 24 h, and reached maximum effect by 40 h incubation, by which time, however, higher levels of necrotic cells were also appearing (results not shown). Lower doses of TNFα were ineffective at inducing cell death (results not shown). Because the 24-h incubation time frame imposed the earliest, significant induction of apoptosis by TNFα, we used it to compare an inhibition of apoptosis by COX-2 overexpression or following its up-regulation. PS externalization is a characteristic hallmark of apoptotic cells, serving as a signal for their phagocytic recognition and removalin vivo (42Savill J.S. Wyllie A.H. Henson J.E. Walport M.J. Henson P.E. Haslett C. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). PS externalization was detected by FITC-AV binding in combination with PI to distinguish between viable (V), early membrane intact apoptotic (EA), and necrotic (N) cells. Because there is no phagocytic disposal mechanism in vitro apoptotic cells accumulate and continue to undergo degradation and membrane lysis. It was crucial, therefore, to include PI in the reaction, and highlight PS exposure on the surface of EA cells, and distinguish them from N cell populations, which may or may not have transited the process of apoptosis (43Ishaque A. Al-Rubeai M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 221: 43-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). By this analysis it was possible to both qualitatively determine viable, V (AV(−)/PI(−)), EA (AV(+)/PI(−)), and N (AV(− and +)/PI(+)) cell fractions (Fig. 2) and simultaneously quantify this transition (TableI). AdWT cells incubated with either TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm) produced distinct fractions of EA cells (28 and 30%, respectively) (Table I and Fig. 2). However, some EA and N cell fractions were induced in control AdWT-infected cells implicating adenovirus-mediated cell death as a result of the infection procedure. Nevertheless the profile and extent of apoptosis induction by TNFα or etoposide in AdWT-infected cells was similar to uninfected cells treated with these inducers in which cell death progressed from V to EA to N cell populations. For cells overexpressing COX-2, the EA cell fraction induced in the AdWT cells by TNFα was significantly suppressed (Fig. 2). The annexin V assay highlighted a reduction in the maximum fraction of EA cells (from 28 to 6%) in AdCOX-2 cells treated with TNFα compared with AdWT-treated cells (Table I and Fig. 2). A substantial fraction of AdCOX-2 cells were N (∼18%) in response to TNFα (Table I and Fig. 2). The transition in cell death for AdCOX-2 cells exposed to TNFα was therefore from V directly to N. AdCOX-2 cells treated with etoposide, on the other hand, gave rise to a distinct EA cell fraction (∼27%) (Table I and Fig. 2). It was noted, that AdCOX-2-infected cells displayed higher levels of N cell fractions in control cultures suggesting that the procedure of adenovirus infection was also inducing necrotic cell death as shown for AdWT-infected control cells.Table IFITC-AV staining for uninfected, AdWT, or AdCOX-2-infected cells treated with etoposide or TNFαCell infection/inducersaUninfected cells or cells infected with AdWT or AdCOX-2 for 24 h were untreated (control) or treated with either TNFα (100 ng/ml) or etoposide (100 μm) for an additional 24 h.Cell fractionbCell viability was quantified in terms of the fraction of V (AV(−)/PI(−)), EA (AV(+)/PI(−)), or N (AV(+)/PI(+)) cells, represented as a percentage of the total cells analyzed by flow cytometry.

SFLLRN-stimulated α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets was inhibited by either antibodies directed at type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase or by a kinase-impaired point mutant of type IIβ PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase. In contrast, recombinant type IIβ PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase augmented SFLLRN-stimulated α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets. SFLLRN-stimulated α-granule secretion was inhibited by a protein kinase C-specific inhibitor peptide or bisindolylmaleimide I.

Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase remained associated with SL-O-permeabilized platelets when incubated in the presence, but not the absence, of SFLLRN. This SFLLRN-induced translocation of type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase was blocked by either the protein kinase C-specific inhibitor peptide or bisindolylmaleimide I. In addition to stimulating α-granule secretion, both SFLLRN and PMA enhanced the association of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled peptide derived from the PtdIns (4,5)P2-binding domain of gelsolin to permeabilized platelets. Agonist-induced recruitment of the PtdIns (4,5)P2-binding domain was inhibited by neomycin, bisindolylmaleimide I, and anti-type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase antibody. These results suggest a mechanism whereby protein kinase C-mediated translocation of type II PtdIns 5-phosphate 4-kinase leads to the recruitment of PtdIns (4,5)P2-binding proteins.

The molecular mechanisms that direct membrane fusion events required for regulated secretion of α-granules from platelets have been studied intensely in recent years (for reviews see Refs. 1Furie B.

The SNARE1 protein isoforms SNAP-23, syntaxin 2 and 4, and VAMP-3 are found in platelets and have been demonstrated to mediate α-granule secretion (3Lemons P.P. Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Bennett M.K.

Several molecules, including Munc-18c,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, Rab4, PKCα, calpain, myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, and PtdIns(4,5)P2, have recently been shown to participate in platelet granule secretion and are proposed to influence distal events in the secretory pathway (5Lemons P.P.

In particular, the mechanism by which ligand-receptor interactions at the platelet surface direct membrane fusion has not been detailed in platelets at the molecular level. Phosphoinositide phosphorylation has been shown to play a prominent role in regulated granule secretion. Initial observations in chromaffin cells demonstrated that the maintenance of polyphosphoinositides is crucial for vesicle secretion (17Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem.

Swigart P. Thomas G. Hsuan J. Cockcroft S. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 730-738Google Scholar) were found to mediate ATP-dependent events required for granule secretion. Activation-dependent translocation of type I PIPK to membranes has emerged as a key event in the regulated synthesis of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Regulated translocation of type I PIPK is directed by ADP-ribosylation factors (21Brown F.D. Rozelle A.L. Yin H.L. Balla T. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 1007-1017Google Scholar, 22Godi A.

Cockcroft S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13962-13966Google Scholar). Investigators have hypothesized that focal sites of PtdIns(4,5)P2 form in areas of PIPK activity following translocation to membranes. According to this model, the nidus of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that is subsequently formed on the cytoplasmic face of the cell membrane binds components of the secretory machinery that contain PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding domains. Support for this model is derived from studies in chromaffin cells in which agonist-induced secretion is blocked by inhibitory PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding proteins that localize to focal membrane sites (24Holz R.W. Hlubek M.D. Sorensen S.D. Fisher S.K. Balla T. Ozaki S. Prestwich G.D. Stuenkel E.L. Bittner M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17878-17885Google Scholar). Thus, translocation of type I PIPK to membranes may initiate its function in granule secretion. Type II PIPK can also undergo activation-dependent translocation (25Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Google Scholar, 26Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Letcher A.J. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 983-986Google Scholar) and contains an activation loop that directs localization of this kinase to specific subcellular locals (27Kunz J. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M. Hurley J.H. Majerus P.W. Anderson R.A. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 1-11Google Scholar, 28Kunz J. Fuelling A. Kolbe L. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5611-5619Google Scholar). Although cellular functions for type II PIPK have been difficult to demonstrate (29Hinchliffe K.A. Ciruela A. Morris J.A. Divecha N. Irvine R.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1999; 27: 657-661Google Scholar), type II PIPK has been shown to participate in MgATP-dependent, Ca2+-triggered α-granule secretion from platelets. In these studies, type II PIPK was shown to act at a priming step prior to Ca2+-triggered secretion (15Rozenvayn N. Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Google Scholar). Whether type II PIPK participates in agonist-induced α-granule secretion and how type II PIPK activity is regulated in platelets, however, has not previously been assessed. We therefore sought to study the role of type II PIPK in agonist-mediated α-granule secretion. Using an agonist-stimulated SL-O-permeabilized platelet model, we demonstrate that type II PIPK participates in agonist-induced α-granule secretion. We also demonstrate that stimulation of platelets by SFLLRN results in PKC-dependent translocation of type II PIPK. Type II PIPK, in turn, mediates recruitment of a FITC-labeled PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding protein derived from gelsolin. All buffer constituents, Triton X-100, and CaCl2 were purchased from Sigma. Sepharose 2B was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Reduced SL-O was purchased from Corgenix (Peterborough, United Kingdom). Bisindolylmaleimide I, PMA, protein kinase C inhibitor peptide (19–31, RFARKGALRQKNV), and 5,6-dichloro-1-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Phycoerythrin-conjugated AC1.2 anti-P-selectin antibody was purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). FITC-QRLFQVKGRR (30Cunningham C.C. Vegners R. Bucki R. Funaki M. Korde N. Hartwig J.H.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43390-43399Google Scholar), FITC-QALFQVAKGAA, irrelevant control peptide (VFLSREEANSVLREE), and SFLLRN were synthesized using solid phase Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer. Goat polyclonal affinity-purified antipeptide antibodies to type II PIPK in phosphate-buffered saline were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody was raised against a peptide consisting of the 19 amino-terminal amino acids of type II PIPK. This antibody recognized a single band of 53 kDa in platelet lysates and recognized recombinant type II PIPK glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins in immunoblot analysis (15Rozenvayn N. Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Google Scholar). Recombinant type IIβ PIPK was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in bacteria using a cDNA (31Castellino A.M.

Recombinant type IIβ PIPK D216A mutant was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein in bacteria using a cDNA kindly provided by Dr. Lewis C. Cantley (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). Recombinant proteins were subsequently purified to homogeneity in Tris buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, 5 mmreduced glutathione, pH 7.5) using standard techniques. The type IIβ PIPK D216A mutant demonstrated 5% of the enzymatic activity of the native type IIβ PIPK. 2K. A. Lamia, personal communication.Purification of recombinant proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. All solutions were prepared using water purified by reverse-phase osmosis on a Millipore Milli-Q purification water system. Blood from healthy donors who had not ingested aspirin in the 2 weeks prior to donation was collected by venipuncture into 0.4% sodium citrate. Citrate-anticoagulated blood was centrifuged at 200 × g for 20 min to prepare platelet-rich plasma. Platelets were then purified from platelet-rich plasma by gel-filtration using a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated in PIPES/EGTA buffer (25 mm PIPES, 2 mm EGTA, 137 mm KCl, 4 mm NaCl, 0.1% glucose, pH 6.4). Final gel-filtered platelet concentrations were 1–2 × 108 platelets/ml. Platelets were permeabilized using reduced SL-O. The ability of each batch of SL-O to permeabilize platelets was tested by analyzing for incorporation of FITC-dextran sulfates by flow cytometry as described previously (4Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Google Scholar). For analysis of P-selectin surface expression from agonist-stimulated, SL-O-permeabilized platelets, 20 μl of gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 108/ml) were permeabilized by exposure to the indicated concentration of reduced SL-O. Samples were adjusted to pH 6.9 immediately following permeabilization and then incubated with SFLLRN, PMA, or buffer. The timing of the addition of inhibitors or recombinant proteins is indicated in the figure legends. Following a 20-min incubation after the addition of agonist, 10 μl of reaction mixture was transferred to 5 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated AC1.2 anti-P-selectin antibody. Phosphate-buffered saline (500 μl) was added to the sample after a 20-min incubation and the platelets were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using the FL2 channel as described below. For these experiments, the amount of P-selectin surface expression above baseline observed in permeabilized platelets exposed to the indicated agonist was set to 100% and all other P-selectin expression is expressed as a percent of this control. In experiments using BAPTA-AM-treated, SL-O-permeabilized platelets, 20 μl of gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 108/ml) were incubated for 30 min with the indicated concentration of BAPTA-AM. Platelets were then permeabilized by exposure to the indicated concentration of reduced SL-O. Samples were adjusted to pH 6.9 immediately following permeabilization. The timing of the addition of agonists, inhibitors, and 10 μm Ca2+ is indicated in the figure legends. The amount of CaCl2required to give a free Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm in the presence of 2 mm EGTA at pH 6.9 was calculated for each condition using a computer program based on the algorithms described by Fabiato and Fabiato (32Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505Google Scholar). Following an additional 15-min incubation after the addition of Ca2+, 10 μl of reaction mixture was transferred into 5 μl of phycoerythrin-conjugated AC1.2 anti-P-selectin antibody and processed as described above. For these experiments, the amount of P-selectin surface expression in the absence of agonist or inhibitor was set at 100% and all other P-selectin expression is expressed as a percent of this control. Gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 107/ml) were pelleted and solubilized in sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2% SDS, 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 14% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. Platelet proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE on 14% gels. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-type II PIPK antibodies directed against the amino-terminal of human type II PIPK (Santa Cruz, CA) and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence. For samples using SFLLRN-stimulated platelets, gel-filtered platelets (2–4 ml) were incubated with 25 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min and subsequently incubated with SFLLRN or buffer for 10 min. Samples were then exposed to 4 units/ml SL-O for 15 min. The permeabilized platelets were pelleted and solubilized in Triton lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 100 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Cytoskeletons were isolated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. As a positive control for the precipitation of the cytoskeleton, gel-filtered platelets were incubated with 1 unit/ml thrombin at 37 °C and stirred. Platelets were then pelleted and solubilized in Triton lysis buffer as described above. Fractions were analyzed for type II PIPK by immunoblotting. For samples using SFLLRN-stimulated platelets, gel-filtered platelets (2–4 ml) were incubated with 25 μm BAPTA-AM for 30 min and subsequently exposed to 100 μm SFLLRN or buffer for 10 min. Noncytoskeletal, Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation of the 10,000 × g supernatant (derived from the cytoskeletal preparation) at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 h. Under conditions in which the 10,000 ×g pellet demonstrated no type II PIPK, noncytoskeletal, Triton X-100-insoluble fractions were isolated by centrifugation of Triton X-100 lysate at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 3 h. Pellets were heated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting for the presence of type II PIPK. For samples using PMA-stimulated platelets, gel-filtered platelets were stimulated with 0.2 μm PMA and solubilized in Triton lysis buffer. The Triton X-100-insoluble fraction was then isolated and analyzed as described above. For analysis of the association of the FITC-labeled gelsolin PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding domain and FITC-labeled control peptides to BAPTA-AM-treated, SL-O-permeabilized platelets, 20 μl of gel-filtered platelets (1–2 × 108/ml) were incubated for 30 min with the indicated concentration of BAPTA-AM. The timing of addition of inhibitors varied according to the inhibitor that was being evaluated and is indicated in the figure legend. Platelets were then incubated for 10 min with SFLLRN, PMA, or buffer and permeabilized by exposure to the indicated concentration of SL-O in the presence of FITC-labeled peptide (5 μm). Following an additional 20-min incubation, the sample was diluted in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry using the FL1 channel as described below. For these experiments, binding of the FITC-labeled gelsolin PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding domain to nonpermeabilized platelets was determined to be background. The amount of FITC-labeled peptide fluorescence greater than background observed in permeabilized, BAPTA-AM-treated platelets exposed to the indicated agonist was set to 100% and all other secretions are expressed as a percent of this control. Flow cytometry was performed on gel-filtered platelet samples using a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer. Fluorescent channels were set at logarithmic gain. Five to ten-thousand particles were acquired for each sample. A 585/42 band pass filter was used for FL1 fluorescence and a 530/30 band pass filter was used for FL-2 fluorescence. FITC was measured in the FL-1 channel. Phycoerythrin was measured in the FL-2 channel. Data were analyzed using CellQuest software on a MacIntosh PowerPC. We have previously demonstrated that type II PIPK participates in α-granule secretion in a MgATP-dependent, Ca2+-triggered secretory system (15Rozenvayn N. Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine the role of type II PIPK in agonist-mediated granule secretion. In these experiments, platelets were permeabilized in the presence of either antibodies or recombinant proteins (33Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M. Carpenter C.L. Janmey P.A. Taylor L.A. Toker A. Stossel T.P. Cell. 1995; 82: 643-653Google Scholar, 34Tolias K.F. Hartwig J.H. Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 153-156Google Scholar) and subsequently stimulated with the protease-activated receptor-1 activating peptide, SFLLRN. P-selectin surface expression was monitored as an indicator of α-granule secretion (35Flaumenhaft R. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 179: 1-10Google Scholar). P-selectin surface expression from platelets permeabilized prior to exposure to SFLLRN was 69 ± 12% that of P-selectin expression from intact platelets exposed to SFLLRN. To assess the role of type II PIPK in SFLLRN-induced α-granule secretion, we used an antibody directed at the amino terminus of type II PIPK that inhibits PIP2 synthesis in permeabilized platelets (15Rozenvayn N. Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Google Scholar). This antibody inhibited SFLLRN-induced P-selectin surface expression from SL-O-permeabilized platelets (Fig.1 A). Nonimmune antibody had no effect in this assay. A kinase-impaired point mutant of type IIβ PIPK also inhibited SFLLRN-induced α-granule secretion from permeabilized platelets (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, recombinant type IIβ PIPK augmented SFLLRN-induced α-granule secretion. Neither recombinant type IIβ PIPK kinase-impaired point mutant nor recombinant type IIβ PIPK affected baseline secretion of α-granules from SL-O-permeabilized platelets (data not shown). Furthermore, neither antibodies nor recombinant proteins affected SFLLRN-induced granule secretion from intact platelets. These data demonstrate that type II PIPK mediates SFLLRN-induced α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets. We next sought to identify downstream signaling elements required for agonist-induced, type II PIPK-mediated α-granule secretion. In platelets, engagement of SFLLRN with protease-activated receptor-1 results in the downstream activation of PKC (36Giesberts A.N. van Willigen G. Lapetina E.G. Akkerman J.W. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 613-620Google Scholar). In addition, PKC is thought to be involved in cellular processes that render granules competent to secrete (37Klenchin V.A. Martin T.F. Biochimie (Paris). 2000; 82: 399-407Google Scholar). We therefore determined the effect of a PKC inhibitor peptide (38House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Google Scholar) and bisindolylmaleimide I (39Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Google Scholar) on SFLLRN-induced α-granule secretion from permeabilized platelets. Under these conditions, both the inhibitor peptide and bisindolylmaleimide I inhibited SFLLRN-stimulated α-granule secretion (Fig.2 A). In contrast, an irrelevant peptide had no effect. These results raise the possibility that PKC is required for agonist-stimulated, type II PIPK-mediated α-granule secretion. Given the possibility that PKC participates in agonist-responsive α-granule secretion, we next sought to determine whether or not the PKC agonist, PMA, is capable of supporting α-granule secretion from permeabilized platelets. In these experiments, platelets were permeabilized with SL-O and subsequently exposed to PMA. Like SFLLRN, PMA was able to stimulate α-granule secretion from permeabilized platelets. PMA is a potent PKC agonist. However, it also targets other proteins that participate in granule secretion such as Munc-13 family proteins and Rac-GTPase-activating proteins (40Kazanietz M.G. Caloca M.J. Eroles P. Fujii T. Garcia-Bermejo M.L. Reilly M. Wang H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 1417-1424Google Scholar). We therefore sought to confirm that the effects of PMA observed in the agonist-responsive platelet secretion model are secondary to activation of PKC. PMA-induced α-granule secretion was inhibited by both the PKC inhibitor peptide and bisindolylmaleimide I (Fig. 2 B). We next determined whether PKC-responsive α-granule secretion from permeabilized platelets was dependent on type II PIPK. Anti-type II PIPK antibodies, but not nonimmune antibodies, infused into SL-O-permeabilized platelets inhibited PMA-induced P-selectin surface expression (Fig. 2 C). Similarly, permeabilization of platelets in the presence of the kinase-impaired mutant of type IIβ PIPK also inhibited PMA-induced P-selectin surface expression (Fig. 2 D). In contrast, permeabilization of platelets in the presence of native recombinant type IIβ PIPK augmented PMA-induced P-selectin surface expression. Neither antibodies nor recombinant proteins affected either baseline P-selectin expression levels or PMA-induced P-selectin expression from intact platelets (data not shown). These data demonstrate that type II PIPK participates in PMA-stimulated α-granule secretion from SL-O-permeabilized platelets. We have previously used a MgATP-dependent, Ca2+-triggered platelet secretory model to demonstrate that type II PIPK acts at an ATP-dependent step prior to Ca2+-triggered secretion (15Rozenvayn N. Flaumenhaft R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22410-22419Google Scholar). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that type II PIPK acts prior to Ca2+-mediated triggering during agonist-induced α-granule secretion. To test this hypothesis, intact platelets were incubated with the cell-permeant Ca2+chelator BAPTA-AM to suppress rapid, Ca2+-mediated triggering of granule secretion from intact platelets. Platelets were subsequently exposed to SFLLRN. Following this exposure, platelets were permeabilized in the presence of Ca2+ to elicit α-granule secretion. This strategy allows for the temporal separation of agonist-dependent events required for granule secretion from Ca2+-triggered secretory events. In these experiments, intact BAPTA-AM-treated platelets failed to express significant amounts of P-selectin on their surface in response to SFLLRN (Fig.3 A). In contrast, BAPTA-treated platelets incubated in the presence or absence of SFLLRN, permeabilized, and then exposed to 10 μm free Ca2+ following permeabilization expressed more P-selectin on their surface following exposure to SFLLRN (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of flow cytometry demonstrated that nearly all of the BAPTA-treated platelets exposed to SFLLRN showed some increase in P-selectin expression (data not shown). This observation negates the possibility that the increase in P-selectin expression is secondary to a minority of fully activated platelets. The amount of P-selectin surface expression observed under these conditions was only 15–30% of that observed in intact platelets stimulated with SFLLRN. To assess whether type II PIPK acts prior to or during Ca2+-mediated triggering of α-granule secretion, antibodies directed at the amino terminus of type II PIPK were infused into BAPTA-AM-treated, SL-O-permeabilized platelets either prior to or following exposure to SFLLRN. Platelets were subsequently incubated with Ca2+ to elicit α-granule secretion. Addition of anti-type II PIPK antibodies to permeabilized platelets prior to addition of SFLLRN resulted in inhibition of SFLLRN-mediated augmentation of Ca2+-triggered P-selectin surface expression (Fig.3 B). Antibodies inhibited SFLLRN-mediated augmentation of P-selectin surface expression nearly to levels observed in samples not exposed to SFLLRN. In contrast, anti-type II PIPK antibodies failed to inhibit SFLLRN-responsive P-selectin surface expression in samples that were exposed to SFLLRN prior to permeabilization in the presence of antibodies (Fig. 3 B). Thus, anti-type II PIPK antibodies inhibited an SFLLRN-dependent step in α-granule secretion prior to Ca2+-induced triggering of secretion. Nonimmune antibodies had no effect on SFLLRN-responsive, Ca2+-triggered P-selectin surface expression. These data demonstrate that type II PIPK is required for an SFLLRN-stimulated priming event that is necessary for α-granule membrane fusion in response to Ca2+. Like SFLLRN, PMA supported Ca2+-triggered α-granule release in BAPTA-AM-treated, SL-O-permeabilized platelets (Fig.3 C). In these studies, BAPTA-AM-treated platelets were exposed to 0.2 μm PMA or buffer and then permeabilized with SL-O in the presence of Ca2+. The degree of P-selectin surface expression in BAPTA-AM-treated platelets exposed to PMA and permeabilized in the presence of Ca2+ was 40–60% of that in untreated intact platelets exposed to PMA. Thus, PMA was a stronger agonist than SFLLRN in rendering BAPTA-AM-treated platelets capable of secreting α-granules in response to Ca2+. Addition of anti-type II PIPK antibodies to permeabilized platelets prior to addition of PMA resulted in inhibition of PMA augmentation of Ca2+-triggered P-selectin surface expression (Fig.3 D). Anti-type II PIPK antibodies failed to inhibit PMA-responsive P-selectin surface expression in samples that were exposed to PMA prior to permeabilization in the presence"
https://openalex.org/W2052822885,"Spliceosome assembly follows a well conserved pathway of subunit addition that includes both small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) particles and non-snRNP splicing factors. Clf1p is an unusual splicing factor composed almost entirely of direct repeats of the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) protein-binding motif. Here we show that the Clf1p protein resides in at least two multisubunit protein complexes, a small nuclear RNA-free structure similar to what was reported as the Prp19p complex (nineteen complex; NTC) and an RNP structure that contains the U2, U5, and U6 small nuclear RNAs. Thirty Ccf (Clf1p complexfactor) proteins have been identified by mass spectroscopy or immune detection as known or suspected components of the yeast spliceosome. Deletion of TPR1 or TPR2 from an epitope-tagged Clf1p protein (i.e. Clf1Δ2-TAP) destabilizes Clf1p complexes assembled in vivo, causing the release of the Cef1p and Prp19p NTC factors and decreased association of the Rse1p, Snu114p, and Hsh155p snRNP proteins. In vitro, temperature inactivation of Clf1Δ2p impairs the prespliceosome to spliceosome transition and prevents Prp19p recruitment to the splicing complex. These and related data support the view that the poly-TPR Clf1p splicing factor promotes the functional integration of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle into the U1-, U2-dependent prespliceosome.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 113-116Google Scholar and 2Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Google Scholar; see references in Refs. 3Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Google Scholar and 4Ladd A.N. Cooper T.A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-16Google Scholar). Numerous studies have demonstrated that in vitro spliceosome assembly progresses through an ordered sequence that is largely conserved from yeast to humans. By tracking assembly through small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) association with pre-mRNA, it has been shown that the U1 snRNP binds independently other snRNP particles in an ATP-independent step said to commit the pre-mRNA to the splicing pathway. U2 snRNP is recruited next in an ATP-dependent step that forms the prespliceosome. Finally, the U4, U5, and U6 snRNAs are jointly recruited as the exceptionally large U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle to produce the spliceosome. Together, the U1/U2 snRNP-dependent prespliceosome and the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle account for all of the snRNAs and the majority of proteins known to act in splicing. A more limited number of non-snRNP splicing factors bind directly to the pre-mRNA substrate to promote snRNP addition or promote conformational changes within the splicing complex following snRNP addition (1Schwer B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 113-116Google Scholar, 2Staley J.P. Guthrie C. Cell. 1998; 92: 315-326Google Scholar, 3Kramer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Google Scholar). Regulated pre-mRNA splicing events are driven by proteins that act to promote or block the recruitment of constitutive splicing factors (4Ladd A.N. Cooper T.A. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: 1-16Google Scholar, 5Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Google Scholar). The major snRNP addition steps are clear targets of this regulation. Whereas comparatively few pre-mRNAs appear regulated in yeast, this system does offer a valuable means to characterize the basic pathway for splicing factor association and hence to identify critical steps in assembly and possible targets for regulation. The addition of the U1 and U2 snRNP particles to the splicing complex occurs in part through well characterized snRNA interactions at the premRNA 5′ splice site and branch point regions, respectively, and is supported by a number of protein-based contacts, reviewed in Refs. 6Burge C.B.

Biol. 2000; 7: 850-854Google Scholar. The U5 and U6 snRNAs also bind the splicing substrate, although these interactions appear to occur subsequent to stable recruitment of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle to the prespliceosome. In yeast, mutations that prevent stable U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP assembly (e.g. Prp6p; see Refs. 8Galisson F. Legrain P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1555-1562Google Scholar and 9Abovich N. Legrain P. Rosbash M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6417-6425Google Scholar) block spliceosome formation, yet little is known in yeast or in mammals of the contacts that actually promote U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle/prespliceosome association. CLF1/SYF3 (henceforth referred to by the Stanford Genome Database standard name, CLF1) was identified as a putative Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA-processing factor based on the presence of multiple crooked neck-like tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs) (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar). This protein binding motif was first recognized as a distinct TPR subtype in the characterization of the Drosophila melanogaster crooked neck (crn) gene product (11Zhang K. Smouse D. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1080-1091Google Scholar) and appears restricted to RNA-processing proteins (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar, 12McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 353-360Google Scholar). Crooked neck and its homologs, including the yeast Clf1p protein, are ∼80 kDa in mass and composed largely of direct iterations of the TPR motif. Loss of function crooked neck mutations in Drosophilaare lethal when homozygous (11Zhang K. Smouse D. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1080-1091Google Scholar) (and references within) and influence alternative splice site selection when heterozygous (13Burnette J.M. Hatton A.R. Lopez A.J. Genetics. 1999; 151: 1517-1529Google Scholar). In humans, the crooked neck protein is a stable component of the spliceosome, recruited at or near the time of U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP addition (14Chung S. Zhou Z. Huddleston K.A. Harrison D.A. Reed R. Coleman T.A. Rymond B.C. Biophys. Biochem. Acta. 2002; 1576: 289-297Google Scholar). In yeast, genetic and biochemical studies implicate Clf1p in a number of steps in spliceosome assembly and in both catalytic steps in splicing (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar, 15Russell C.S. Ben-Yehuda S. Dix I. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 2000; 6: 1565-1572Google Scholar, 16Ben-Yehuda S. Dix I. Russell C.S. McGarvey M. Beggs J.D. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1503-1517Google Scholar, 17Dix I. Russell C.S. O'Keefe R.T. Newman A.J. Beggs J.D. RNA. 1998; 4: 1675-1686Google Scholar, 18Chen C.H. Yu W.C. Tsao T.Y. Wang L.Y. Chen H.R. Lin J.Y. Tsai W.Y. Cheng S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1029-1037Google Scholar). This broad spectrum of Clf1p interactions is consistent with the 15 TPR repeats of Clf1p serving as a platform for the recruitment of splicing factors during spliceosome assembly. Clf1p is present in the nineteen complex (NTC), a structure that contains Prp19p and at least eight other proteins but no RNA (see Ref.18Chen C.H. Yu W.C. Tsao T.Y. Wang L.Y. Chen H.R. Lin J.Y. Tsai W.Y. Cheng S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1029-1037Google Scholar and references within) (19Tarn W.Y. Lee K.R. Cheng S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1883-1891Google Scholar). Yeast extracts metabolically depleted of Clf1p block the prespliceosome to spliceosome transition even in the presence of stable U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP complexes (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar), suggesting that Clf1p acts in the recruitment or retention of the U4/U6.U5 tri-snRNP particle. Curiously, whereas Clf1p functions prior to stable spliceosome formation, the NTC is reported to bind the splicing complex later, during or after the U4 snRNA release from the mature spliceosome (20Tarn W.Y. Lee K.R. Cheng S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10821-10825Google Scholar). This inconsistency and results from the Schizosaccharomyces pombe system that cast doubt on the RNA-free status of the NTC (21McDonald W.H. Ohi R. Smelkova N. Frendewey D. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5352-5362Google Scholar) stimulated a detailed analysis of Clf1p function in the spliceosome assembly pathway. The genetic and biochemical data presented here show that Prp19p and Clf1p reside in at least two resolvable states, a complex free of snRNA similar to the NTC and an RNP complex reminiscent of an endogenous late stage or postcatalytic spliceosome. Removal of TPR elements from the Clf1p amino terminus results in the conditional release of several essential splicing factors and blocks the recruitment of Prp19p to the splicing apparatus. These observations provide evidence that the N-terminal TPR elements of Clf1p recruit splicing factors required for the successful integration of the two large RNP halves of the spliceosome. Details on the construction of the clf1::HIS3 yeast deletion mutant and the GAL1::clf1(697), Ycplac22-CLF1-HA, and Ycplac22-clf1Δ2 plasmid constructs were previously published (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar). Ycplac22-clf1Δ1 was prepared similarly by inverse PCR with oligonucleotides Δ1-1 and Δ1-2 (TableI). The TAP epitope was amplified from plasmid pBS1479 (22Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar) with oligonucleotides TAP1 and TAP2 and blunt end-ligated into a SnaBI site created by PCR mutagenesis (with oligonucleotides SNA1 and SNA2) at the 3′-end of theCLF1 coding sequence. The Ycplac22-CLF1-TAP and deletion constructs were transformed into SY101 yeast (MATa, ura3–53, lys2–801a, ade2–101, trp1Δ1, his3-Δ200, leu2-Δ, clf1::HIS3,pSY1[GAL1::clf1(679), URA3], selected on galactose-based complete medium without tryptophan (23$$Google Scholar). Subsequent assays for mutant gene activity were done on YPD medium made with 2% glucose or on complete medium with 1 μg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid (24Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 164-175Google Scholar). Haploid stains deleted forISY1, SYF2, ECM2, and NTC20were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). CLF1-TAP was transformed into this mutant set as a XbaI-SphI DNA fragment cloned into the URA3-marked plasmid, Ycplac33 (25Gietz R.D. Sugino A.

Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Google Scholar). The TAP PCR fragment was inserted into a SmaI site engineered in the 3′-end of thePRP46 coding sequence. The Ycplac111-PRP46-TAPplasmid was transformed into yeast heterozygous for a PRP46deletion obtained from the ATCC. Haploid strains that exclusively expressed the plasmid-borne PRP46-TAP allele were isolated from meiotic offspring. The analysis of cellular pre-mRNA splicing was conducted as described (26Blanton S. Srinivasan A. Rymond B.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3939-3947Google Scholar). To deplete Clf1p from yeast, theGAL1::clf(697) strain was grown to early log phase in galactose-based YP medium (23$$Google Scholar), harvested by centrifugation, washed with 1 culture volume of sterile water, and then incubated in glucose-based YP medium for 6–8 h. Splicing extracts were prepared by grinding yeast cell pellets in liquid nitrogen as described (27Umen J.G. Guthrie C. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 855-868Google Scholar). Pre-mRNA substrates were prepared by in vitrotranscription of pSPrp51A (RP51A) (28Pikielny C.W. Rosbash M. Cell. 1986; 45: 869-877Google Scholar) or pT7Δ2 (rp51Δ2) (29Rymond B.C. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 428-439Google Scholar) with nucleotide triphosphates including [32P]UTP or biotin 16-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and a 5-fold molar excess of cap analog (New England Biolabs). Streptavidin-agarose affinity purification of spliceosomes and snRNA analyses were performed as described (30Xie J. Beickman K. Otte E. Rymond B.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2938-2946Google Scholar) scaled down to an 80-μl splicing reaction. Spliceosome assembly was assayed by native gel electrophoresis, and pre-mRNA splicing was assayed by denaturing gel electrophoresis as described (31Pikielny C.W. Rymond B.C. Rosbash M. Nature. 1986; 324: 341-345Google Scholar). Clf1Δ2-TAP extracts were temperature-inactivated by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min or at 34 °C for 30 min and used without additional manipulation. Complementation experiments were performed by incubation of 50–100,000 cpm of labeled pre-mRNA substrate with the temperature-inactivated extract for 5 min under splicing conditions in a volume of 8.5 μl followed by the addition of 1.5 μl of Clf1p complex (approximately 3 ng of protein) together with a 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled pre-mRNA. To isolate preparative quantities of the Clf1-TAP complex, 50 liters of yeast were harvested by centrifugation at anA 600 of 2–3. The cell pellets were washed twice with 2 liters of sterile water and resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The yeasts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then broken in a Waring blender as described (32Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4001-4009Google Scholar). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 20,500 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor for 30 min followed by 84 min at 33,500 rpm in a Beckman Ti45 rotor. The cleared lysate was then dialyzed against buffer D (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm benzamidine, 20% glycerol) for 3 h. The extract was adjusted to 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 immediately prior to TAP affinity purification, performed as described (22Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar), except that 2 ml of rabbit IgG agarose (Sigma) was used for 500 ml of lysate. Analytical scale preparation of 35S-labeled TAP complexes was performed by adding 1 mCi of Trans-35S (ICN) to the equivalent of 10 ml of culture at an A 600 of 1.0 for 4–5 h at 30 °C as described (33Kolodziej P.A. Young R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 508-519Google Scholar). For temperature shifts, theclf1Δ1-TAP and CLF1-TAP cultures were incubated to 37 °C for the final 1 h of labeling. The cell pellets were collected by centrifugation and washed once with water, and proteins were extracted by vortexing the pellet for 4 min with glass beads in buffer A. TAP purification was then performed as described (22Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar), scaled down for use with the reduced volumes. Where indicated, NaCl was increased to 300 or 450 mm before cell breakage. RNase-treated samples were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 22 μg/ml RNase A and 444 units/ml of RNase T1 (Ambion) prior to TAP purification. The recovered protein samples were precipitated with 6% trichloroacetic acid, resolved on a 5–10% gradient (or 8% nongradient) SDS-polyacrylamide gel with BenchMarkTMmolecular weight markers (Invitrogen), and visualized with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, the samples were fractionated on a 15–40% glycerol gradient prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 (or 200) mm NaCl, and 5 mm MgCl2 prior to protein and snRNA analyses. The purified Clf1-TAP complex sample was resolved on a 5–10% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel in a Tris-Tricine buffer system (34Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with silver (35Gharahdaghi F. Weinberg C.R. Meagher D.A. Imai B.S. Mische S.M. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 601-605Google Scholar), and the protein-containing bands were excised and digested with trypsin (36Rosenfeld J. Capdevielle J. Guillemot J.C. Ferrara P. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 173-179Google Scholar). The tryptic peptides were fractionated with a Luna C18 (1 × 50 mm, 3-μm particle size) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) using an acetonitrile/water (0.1% formic acid) gradient at a flow rate of 35 μl/min. The LC column was connected to the electrospray interface of an LCQ Classic mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Mass spectra were acquired using data-dependent analysis (full scan automatically followed by tandem mass spectrometry of the most intense ion detected by the data system). Alternatively, the Clf1-TAP complexes were assayed by DALPC without gel fractionation using strong cation exchange and C18 (Whatman) packing material on a LCQ Deca mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). In all cases, the tandem mass spectra were converted to mass/intensity lists and searched against the nonredundant OWL data base using SEQUEST and the nonredundant NCBI data base using MASCOT. The number of unique peptides identified for each protein was as follows: Clf1p, 26; Prp8p, 21; Brr2p, 10; Rse1p, 3; Snu114p, 5; Hsh155p, 4; Syf1p, 22; Cef1p, 26; Prp28p, 2; Prp19P, 14; Prp46p, 6; Prp45p, 4; Cwc2p, 3; Cwc23p, 4; Ecm2p, 4; Isy1p, 5; Smb1p, 2; Syf2p, 2; Snt309p, 8; Smd1p, 3; Ntc20p, 4; Smd2p, 7; Smd3p, 3; Lsm2p, 1; Sme1p, 1; Smx3p, 1; Prp22p, 13; Cus2p, 2. Proteins without confirmed links to splicing that co-purified with Clf1-TAP in one or more preparations include Aad15p, Adh1p, Ade6p, Bud31p, Cin8p, Imp2p, Lem3p, Nop1p, Pdc1p, Ptc7p, Rgd2p, Rpl8ap, Rlp18bp, Rlp24p, Rpl28p, Rpl15p Rpl18bp, Rps14p, Rps19ap, Rpl24p, Rps17p, Rps13p, Rpl13p, Rps6p, Scc2p, Smc3p, Ssa2p, Ssa4p, Sum1p, Tef2p, Tdh1p, Tdh3p, Ulp1p, Zms1p, and the product of open reading frames YGL034C, YKR022C, YIL080W, and YLR424W. To learn more of Clf1p function in spliceosome assembly, proteins associating with this essential splicing factor were purified from yeast. As a first step, Clf1p was modified to include a TAP affinity cassette (22Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods. 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar) at the nonessential C terminus (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar). TheCLF1-TAP strain and a negative control strain that expresses a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged protein that does not bind the TAP affinity resin were labeled with [35S]methionine and cysteine for 4 h prior to tandem affinity purification. PAGE analysis reveals numerous proteins present in the Clf1-TAP but absent in the Clf1-HA control sample (Fig. 1 A). Thirty of the Ccf (Clf1p complexfactor) proteins were identified as known or suspected splicing factors by mass spectroscopy (TableII). In several cases, two or three Ccf proteins co-migrate in a single band, leading to an underestimation of the number of Ccf factors by one-dimensional electrophoresis. The validity of the Ccf assignments was spot-checked with antibodies against specific proteins and through the use of gene-specific deletion strains (Table I; see “Experimental Procedures”). For the sake of consistency, the established nomenclature will be used for all previously identified Ccf splicing factors.Table IICcf protein identitiesCcfMassaMolecular mass in kDa based on protein sequence (identified factors) or estimated by band mobility (unidentified factors).Proposed identitybIndicated by mass analysis of gel slice (1), immune detection (2), deletion analysis (3), mobility consistent with protein predicted by electrospray ionization mass analysis (4).

Open table in a new tab In order to investigate the subunit diversity of the Clf1p complex(es), the 35S-labeled affinity-purified proteins were resolved on a 15–40% glycerol gradient, and alternate fractions were compared (Fig. 1 B; note, for clarity, where multiple proteins are present in a single band, only one is labeled). Fraction 1 contains mostly background proteins, a pattern similar to that observed with the control extract in Fig. 1 A. Superimposed on this pattern in fraction 3 and extending through fraction 11 are Clf1p, Syf1p, Ccf8p, Prp19p, and Isy1p (but presumably not the co-migrating Lea1p protein; see snRNA analysis, discussed below). Cef1p co-migrates with Clf1p at ∼84 kDa (due to the presence of residual TAP sequence) but can be resolved with the use of Clf1p TPR deletion mutants or when an alternatively tagged strain is used for purification (see below). Other than the undetectable levels of certain low molecular weight proteins that label poorly (e.g. Syf2p and Snt309p), this banding pattern closely resembles that of the NTC and will be referred to as the Clf1p-NTC to designate the protein used for purification. Two unidentified proteins, Ccf8p, which may be equivalent to Ntc81p (37Tsai W.Y. Chow Y.T. Chen H.R. Huang K.T. Hong R.I. Jan S.P. Kuo N.Y. Tsao T.Y. Chen C.H. Cheng S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9455-9462Google Scholar), and a previously unreported protein of ∼220 kDa (Ccf25p) are also present in these fractions. A small amount of Prp8p and Brr2p are reproducibly observed in this region of the gradient as well. The Sm/Lsm core snRNP proteins are absent in fractions 1–11. With the intriguing exception of Ccf8p, the Clf1p-NTC complex proteins become markedly enriched in fractions 13–15. Here too are the U5-snRNP-associated proteins Prp28p and Snu114p (as well as Prp8p and Brr2p), Prp46p, the co-migrating Prp45p/Slu7p and Cwc2p/Cwc23p/Ecm2p protein sets, the uncharacterized protein Ccf14p, the Sm/Lsm proteins, and four protein bands not observed prior to gradient separation (Ccf25p-Ccf28p; see Table II). Ccf26p has been identified by Western blot as Prp22p, a protein that interacts genetically with Clf1p and other components of the Clf1p-RNP complex (16Ben-Yehuda S. Dix I. Russell C.S. McGarvey M. Beggs J.D. Kupiec M. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1503-1517Google Scholar, 38van Nues R.W. Beggs J.D. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1451-1467Google Scholar). In addition to the mentioned proteins, fractions 17–23 also contain the U2 snRNP-specific proteins Rse1p and Hsh155p, presumably Lea1p, the Ccf29p band (Cus2p), and factors found in the lighter snRNP-enriched gradient fractions. Of the proteins identified by mass analysis, only Prp16p was not observed as an obvious gel band. The Clf1p profile from whole cell extract (Fig. 1 C) is similar to that of the purified complex with discreet pools in the lower and upper regions of the gradient, although the high concentration of total protein in fractions 3–5 partially inhibits Clf1p transfer (see Fig.2 E for a related image). The presence of Clf1-TAP in fractions 7–11 of the whole cell extract argues against the Clf1p-NTC arising from dissociation of the larger complex during the lengthy affinity purification steps. The Clf1-TAP peak enriched for U2 as well as U5 and U6 snRNP proteins (Fig. 1,B and C, roughly fractions 17–19) overlaps the position of the U4/U5.U6 snRNP particle (Fig. 1 D) and corresponds to a complex of ∼40 S. A subset of the known U2 and U5 snRNP proteins co-purify with the Clf1p complex. Recently, Cef1p-bearing multi-snRNP complexes were reported to be RNase-resistant (39Ohi M.D. Link A.J. Ren L. Jennings J.L. McDonald W.H. Gould K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2011-2024Google Scholar). In contrast, treatment of the Clf1-TAP extract with RNase A and T1 prior to purification causes release of Lsm2p, Smb1p, Smd2p, Sme1p, and Smx3p core snRNP proteins and a reduction in the Smd1p/Ntc20p band intensity (Fig. 2 A). Multiple other proteins, including the U2- and U5-specific snRNP proteins, remain Clf1-TAP-associated. The RNase treatment regime used degrades all snRNA detectable by Northern blot (data not shown). Consequently, it appears that snRNA contacts stabilize core snRNP protein association with the Clf1p complex, whereas the bulk of the remaining components associate though protein-based contacts. It is possible, however, that small RNA fragments persist in the Clf1p complex and contribute to this stabilization. Consistent with the snRNP protein composition, the U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs (but not U1 or U4 snRNA) are enriched in the affinity-purified Clf1-TAP complexes (Fig. 2 B). Nonspecific binding to the TAP affinity resin is very low, since no detectable snRNAs are recovered with a control extract that lacks a TAP-tagged protein (i.e.Clf1-HA). The bulky TAP epitope enhances snRNA recovery, since previous experiments performed with alternative CLF1 alleles failed to recover snRNA (10Chung S. McLean M.R. Rymond B.C. RNA. 1999; 5: 1042-1054Google Scholar) or recovered no U2 snRNA and nearly background levels of U5 and U6 snRNA (15Russell C.S. Ben-Yehuda S. Dix I. Kupiec M. Beggs J.D. RNA. 2000; 6: 1565-1572Google Scholar). The amount of snRNA recovered with Clf1-TAP is less than what is commonly observed with snRNP-specific proteins, however. Soluble Clf1-TAP protein recovery is typically 30–70% (Fig. 2 C), and only 2–5% of the U2, U5, and U6 snRNAs co-purify. As shown above, the Clf1p present in whole cell lysates distributes broadly across a 15–40% glycerol gradient. When these gradient fractions are used for immune precipitation, the majority of Clf1-TAP-associated snRNA is recovered from the poly-snRNP fraction (fractions 15–19) with no detectable free U6 snRNP (Fig.2 D, fractions 5–7; see Fig. 1 D) and little if any U4/U6 di-snRNP (fractions 9–11), or free U2 snRNP or U5 snRNP (fractions 7–13) precipitating.

https://openalex.org/W2050541493,"Isoforms of the smooth muscle myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1) are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing of exons. Tissue-specific expression of these isoforms is thought to determine smooth muscle-relaxant properties and unique responses to signaling pathways. We used mini-gene deletion/mutation constructs to identify cis regulators of splicing of the chicken MYPT1 central alternative exon. Comparisons of alternative exon splicing were made between smooth muscle cells of the fast-phasic contractile phenotype (gizzard), in which the central alternative exon is skipped, and slow tonic contractile phenotype (aorta), in which the alternative exon is included. We demonstrate that splicing of the alternative exon requires a cis-enhancer complex in the vicinity of the alternative exon 5′-splice site. This complex consists of two UCUU motifs in an intronic U-rich sequence (putative PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding) or T cell inhibitor of apoptosis-1 binding sites), an intronic 67-nucleotide enhancer that has similarities with the cardiac Troponin T MSE3 enhancer, and a potentially novel exonic splicing enhancer. The exonic enhancer contains the palindromic sequence UCCUACAUCCU present in many other transcripts where alternative splicing of exons occurs, suggesting that it may be more broadly active. The exonic enhancer is adjacent to a potentially novel exonic silencer element that contains a 13-nucleotide imperfect palindromic sequence. This silencer, in conjunction with a distal intronic silencer, is proposed to mediate the silencing of splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon in the fast phasic smooth muscle phenotype.

This silencer, in conjunction with a distal intronic silencer, is proposed to mediate the silencing of splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon in the fast phasic smooth muscle phenotype. Smooth muscle tissues show considerable phenotypic and functional diversity. Much of the phenotypic diversity in smooth muscle tissues is generated by the alternative splicing of exons from single gene transcripts. As many as 50% of vertebrate genes are estimated to have alternative splicing of exons as a mechanism by which multiple protein isoforms with different or modified functions are generated from a single gene (1Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Google Scholar, 2Brett D. Pospisil H. Valcarcel J. Reich J. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 29-30Google Scholar, 3Modrek B. Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Google Scholar). The process of splice site selection and exon definition for exons that are constitutively spliced has been well described (4Berget S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2411-2414Google Scholar, 5Robberson B.L. Cote G.J. Berget S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 84-94Google Scholar, 6Burge C.B. Tuschl T. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T. Atkins J.F.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Google Scholar, 8Abovich N. Rosbash M. Cell. 1997; 89: 403-412Google Scholar). A number of factors are known to contribute to the “weakening” of the splicing reaction so that splicing of an exon may be regulated. These factors include exon and intron size, RNA secondary structure, and the extent to which the 5′-splice site, branchpoint, and polypyrimidine tract sequences match the consensus sequences for U1 snRNP, SF1, and U2AF binding, respectively (9Balvay L. Libri D. Fiszman M.Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 165-169Google Scholar, 10Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Google Scholar, 11Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 527-577Google Scholar). A number of cis-elements that regulate the splicing of alternative exons have been identified (reviewed in Refs. 10Lopez A.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 279-305Google Scholar, 12Blencowe B.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 106-110Google Scholar, 13Cooper T.A. Mattox W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 61: 259-266Google Scholar, 14Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Google Scholar). We are interested in defining the cis-regulatory elements that account for the great variety in exon splicing that generates diversity in smooth muscle. This aspect of smooth muscle phenotypic diversity has not been examined. We have selected the MYPT1 subunit of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase as a model gene to address this question for several reasons: 1) MYPT1 isoforms are thought to determine smooth muscle relaxant properties and tissue-specific relaxant responses to signaling pathways (15Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Google Scholar, 16Richards C.T. Ogut O. Brozovich F.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4422-4427Google Scholar). 2) Isoforms of MYPT1 are generated by cassette-type alternative splicing of single exons in the central and 3′-end of the pre-mRNA. Splicing of each exon is tissue-specific and developmentally regulated (15Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Google Scholar, 17Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). Around the time of hatching (ED21), the MYPT1 isoforms in the chicken gizzard (phasic fast contracting smooth muscle) completely switch from central exon-in and 3′-exon-out to central exon-out and 3′-exon-in. In contrast, the slow tonic contracting aorta smooth muscle throughout development expresses MYPT1 isoforms in which the central alternative exon is included, and the 3′ alternative exon is skipped (15Khatri J.J. Joyce K.M. Brozovich F.V. Fisher S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37250-37257Google Scholar, 17Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). We hypothesized that cis-acting silencer(s) may mediate the silencing of splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon that occurs in the phasic gizzard tissue in vivo around the time of hatching. We have previously shown that smooth muscle phenotypic diversity is rapidly lost under routine cell culture conditions, in which phasic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) revert to the more embryonic tonic phenotype and display tonic/slow contractile properties in vitro (17Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar, 23Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Google Scholar). We therefore developed a novel in vivo(whole animal) plasmid delivery method to identifycis-elements that regulate splicing of the MYPT1 central alternative exon and may be important in the generation of smooth muscle phenotypic diversity. Several strategies were used to identify candidate splicing regulatory sequences. First, the intron sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers AF110177 and AF110176) were compared with sequences in the NCBI data base (BLAST search) to identify sequences that are also present in introns from other genes. Second, the intron sequences were scanned with sequences known to regulate the splicing of other pre-mRNAs using the GeneQuest program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI). Third, the alternative exon sequence was searched for matches to previously characterized ESE sequences, including optimal binding sites for the SR proteins SC35, SF2/ASF, SRp40, and SRp55, as determined by functional systematicevolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) experiments (18Liu H.X. Zhang M. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1998-2012Google Scholar, 19Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Google Scholar). Finally, the corresponding chicken and rat MYPT1 sequences were compared with each other to identify sequence identities and dissimilarities between them within the alternative exon and flanking introns. This approach identified a number of regions/sequences in the alternative exon and downstream intron that were potentially significant (described under “Results”) and facilitated targeted deletion and mutation analyses to determine their functional significance. A 5.4-kb genomic fragment containing the chicken MYPT1 central alternative exon and flanking introns and exons (Fig. 2 A) was generated by PCR using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Diagnostics). Genomic DNA from chicken liver was amplified using a sense oligonucleotide at +1576 (5′-AAAGGATCCAGACTTGCCTATGTTGCACC-3′) and an antisense oligonucleotide at +1925 (5′-CACGAGCTCAAGTTGAACCCGTTGTACTC-3′) of the chicken MYPT1 M133 cDNA sequence (20Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Google Scholar). BamHI and SacI restriction enzyme recognition sequences were placed at the 5′-ends of the oligonucleotides. The genomic fragment was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector using the Original TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The exon and splice site sequences in the cloned genomic fragment were confirmed by DNA sequencing to match the sequence as previously determined (17Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). The entire MYPT1 genomic fragment was removed from the pCR2.1 vector by restriction digestion at BstXI sites in the pCR2.1 vector and cloned into the BstXI site of pRc/RSV, a eukaryotic expression vector (Invitrogen), upstream of the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal (Fig. 2 B). Large deletions in the introns were engineered in several steps. First, the alternative exon was deleted along with 2522 and 2169 nucleotides of the upstream and downstream introns, respectively (termed MCS vector). This vector was generated using the Expand Long Template PCR system (Roche Diagnostics) and sense (5′-GGTCACCATATGCCGCGGGCCCCAGAAAGATTCAG-3′) and antisense (5′-CGGGTCCGGATCGATGGCCGGCCACAAAACAATGTG-3′) oligonucleotides that created a linker region with the following unique restriction sites at the site of the deletion: FseI,ClaI, BspEI, PshAI, BstEII,NdeI, SacII, EcoO109I, andApaI. Next, a Tsp45I fragment containing the alternative exon surrounded by 267 and 602 nucleotides of the upstream and downstream introns, respectively, was cloned into theBstEII site of the MCS vector, generating the Δui+di (upstream intron and downstream intron deleted) vector in Fig. 3(lane 2). Δui (lane 3) was generated by cloning a HindIII-EcoO109I fragment from the Δui+di vector containing the upstream intron deletion into theHindIII and EcoO109I sites of the wild-type MYPT1 mini-gene vector. Δdi (lane 4) was generated by cloning aEcoNI-SmaI fragment from the Δui+di vector containing the downstream intron deletion into the EcoNI andSmaI sites of the wild-type MYPT1 mini-gene vector. Finally, Δdi+1λ and Δdi+2λ (lanes 5 and 6) were generated by insertion of one and two copies, respectively, of the 1-kb “stuffer” DNA sequence derived from phage lambda DNA (21Bell M.V. Cowper A.E. LeFranc M.P. Bell J.I. Screaton G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5930-5941Google Scholar). This was accomplished by removing one or two copies of the 1-kb stuffer sequence from the vector Bluescript (Stratagene, gift from G. Screaton) by digestion with SacII and ApaI, which were then inserted into the unique SacII and ApaI sites of the vector Δdi. A chimeric vector was engineered by an exact replacement of chicken MYPT1 alternative exon with the corresponding exon from the rat MYPT1 gene. This vector was generated using the Expand Long Template PCR system. Briefly, two oligonucleotides (5′-CTGTAAATAAGATTTTGTTTTAGC-3′ and 5′-GTGTGGGATTTTCTCTTGTCTTTT-3′), which hybridize immediately upstream and downstream of the chicken alternative exon, were used to PCR-amplify the entire chicken MYPT1 expression vector, minus the chicken alternative exon. The rat MYPT1 exon was PCR-amplified using two phosphorylated oligonucleotides that begin at the first nucleotide of the corresponding rat MYPT1 exon (5′P-AGAGTCTTCAAATTTGCGAACA-3′) and at the last nucleotide of the rat exon (5′P-CTTCTATGGTAAGTAGATCCTTCA-3′). These two PCR-amplified fragments were ligated as blunt-ended fragments to generate a chimeric vector containing a precise replacement of the chicken alternative exon sequence with the rat exon sequence. The identity of this chimeric vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. All of the remaining deletions and mutations in the MYPT1 mini-gene (shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7) were generated using the Expand Long Template PCR system with specific oligonucleotides to set the boundaries of the deletion. All of the deletions in the Δ1, Δ2, and Δ3 series (Figs. 4 and 5) contained a unique ApaI restriction enzyme recognition sequence at the site of the deletions so that the deletions could be confirmed by ApaI digestion. Long PCR was also used to make all of the desired point mutations by including the mutation(s) in the oligonucleotides used for PCR. PCR cycle number was limited to minimize the occurrence of second-site mutations, and multiple independent clones of each construct were tested in transfection assays. All clones were sequenced to verify that they had the desired mutations and that the alternative exon and splice site sequences were intact.Figure 6Deletion/mutation analysis identifies an intronic pyrimidine-rich sequence required for exon inclusion.

Williams P. Acsadi G. Jiao S. Jani A. Chong W. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 474-485Google Scholar). We optimized expression conditions from an injected plasmid DNA by performing DNA dose-response curves and time course experiments with a vector containing luciferase as a reporter gene. 1–50 μg of plasmid DNA containing either the SV40 early promoter driving transcription of the Sea Panzy (Renilla reniformis) luciferase gene or the RSV promoter driving transcription of the Firefly (Photinus) luciferase gene were injected. White leghorn chickens (Gallus gallus, 1–2 days old, hatched from eggs obtained from Squire Valleevue Farm, Cleveland, OH) were anesthetized with inhaled Halothane (Halocarbon Laboratories) and, after depilation, a longitudinal midline abdominal incision was made to expose the gizzard. Each plasmid in a volume of 20–30 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.015% Evan's Blue dye was injected into each of the two lobes of the gizzard smooth muscle using a 50-μl Hamilton syringe. The skin was then sutured and the bird awakened. The birds were sacrificed by decapitation 1–7 days later, and the gizzard smooth muscle was isolated by dissection and homogenized in 0.75–1.75 ml of 1× passive lysis buffer from the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). After the lysates were centrifuged, the supernatants were assayed for either Renilla or Firefly luciferase activity as described by the manufacturer, using either a single sample luminometer or a TriLux scintillation counter. In separate experiments, chicken gizzards were injected with 10 μg of the plasmid pDsRed1-N1 (Clontech), which expresses the red fluorescent protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. Additional chicken gizzards were injected with pUC plasmid as controls. One day later, the gizzards were harvested, frozen in OCT, and cryosectioned. Sections were examined by fluorescence microscopy on the rhodamine channel. Control and experimental samples were photographed with identical exposures using a Spot RT digital camera. Sections were then formalin-fixed, permeabilized, and stained with phalloidin-FITC (Sigma) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. Phalloidin specifically binds to filamentous actin and thus identifies muscle cells in the section. The same approximate region that was photographed on the red channel was rephotographed on the fluorescein channel to identify the phalloidin labeled smooth muscle cells. The MYPT1 mini-gene expression vectors were injected into gizzard tissue as described above, with the exception that chicks were 1–2 weeks old and 25 μg of plasmid DNA was injected in 50 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.15–0.3% Evan's Blue dye. One day later the gizzards were removed and the blue-stained portions of the smooth muscle tissue were dissected. The dissected tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and processed for total RNA isolation using either Ultraspec II (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.) or the Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Stratagene). Smooth muscle cells were isolated from gizzards and aorta of embryonic chicks as previously described (17Dirksen W.P. Vladic F. Fisher S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C589-C600Google Scholar). Briefly, gizzard or aorta tissue was removed from ED14–15 embryos, minced into fine fragments, and digested with repeated rounds of collagenase treatment. Pooled individual cells were cultured on tissue culture plastic with a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 media in the presence of 10% serum (heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, HyClone Laboratories). The cells were passaged when sub-confluent with a 1:4 split. Smooth muscle cells were used for transfection after 1–3 passages. These cultures have been previously characterized and shown to be greater than 90% smooth muscle cells as determined by staining for α-actin (23Fisher S.A. Ikebe M. Brozovich F. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 885-893Google Scholar). LMH, a chicken hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (ATCC CRL-2117), was cultured on 0.1% gelatin with Waymouth's MB 752/1 medium in the presence of 10% serum. Transfections were performed on 24-well dishes. Cells were plated 1–2 days before each transfection at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well (LMH) and 1.5 × 105 cells/well (SMCs), such that on the day of the transfection they would be 50–70% confluent. Each mammalian expression vector containing the wild-type or a mutant MYPT1 mini-gene (0.15 μg of plasmid per well) was transfected into these cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) at a LipofectAMINE to DNA ratio (wt:wt) of 12–18:1 (LMH) and 14:1 (gizzard). Serum-containing media was added to the cells 5 h after transfection. RNA was isolated 24 h after transfection using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The injected and transfected RNA samples were analyzed by RT-PCR for the presence of exon-included and exon-skipped MYPT1 mini-gene transcripts. The sense oligonucleotide (5′-GGCCAGTACCTCTGACATTGATGA-3′) was complementary to chicken MYPT1 cDNA at +1620 (20Shimizu H. Ito M. Miyahara M. Ichikawa K. Okubo S. Konishi T. Naka M. Tanaka T. Hirano K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30407-30411Google Scholar) and the antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GCTGGCAACTAGAAGGCACAGTCG-3′) was complementary to the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal present in the pRc/RSV expression vector at position +745 (see Fig. 2 B). Thus, this PCR primer pair did not detect the endogenous MYPT1 mRNA (data not shown). Visualization of the RT-PCR products was accomplished by 5′-end-labeling the sense PCR oligonucleotide with a Cy5 fluorescent label (IDT and Research Genetics). RT reactions were performed with 0.5 and 5–10 μg of input total RNA from transfected and injected RNA samples, respectively. RNA was reverse-transcribed using the antisense primer and AMV Reverse Transcriptase (AMV RT) enzyme (Roche Diagnostics) in a volume of 50 μl. The PCR reactions were performed with Taq DNA Polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) orTaq Bead Hot Start Polymerase (Promega) in a volume of 50 μl. The reactions consisted of 23–27 (transfected) and 30–32 (injected) cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. RT-PCR products were separated on 6% native polyacrylamide gels. The fluorescence from the Cy5 label was detected using a Storm 860 Imager (Amersham Biosciences). The exon-included and exon-skipped MYPT1 RT-PCR products were quantified using Amersham Biosciences ImageQuaNT software. Several controls were performed to verify the specificity and accuracy of the RT-PCR reactions. RT-PCR was performed on RNA from cells that were injected or transfected with a pRc/RSV vector containing no insert. Also, to verify that the RT-PCR products were RNA-dependent, RT-PCR reactions were performed omitting the AMV RT. To verify that the RT-PCR reactions were quantitative, PCR reactions were performed using two different amounts, 0.5 and 2 μl, of input cDNA from each RT reaction. Each pair of PCR reactions was judged by the following two criteria: 1) that there would be approximately a 4-fold increase in total signal resulting from the 4-fold difference in input cDNA to verify that the PCR reaction was not saturated and 2) that the ratio of exon inclusion to exon skipping would not change significantly between the two PCR reactions. This control was performed with all of the RNA samples analyzed in this study. Finally, to verify that the injection procedure did not adversely affect the splicing machinery, RT-PCR was performed on a number of injected RNA samples to detect the endogenous MYPT1 transcript. These controls revealed that splicing of endogenous MYPT1 was not affected by the injection procedure (n = 6). Quantification of exon-included and exon-skipped MYPT1 RT-PCR products was obtained as described above. Because the hypothesis to be tested was that cis-elements mediate tissue-specific silencing of the splicing of the alternative exon in phasic smooth muscle, all data are presented as the percentage of exon-skipped/total MYPT1 mRNA. The values shown in this study represent the mean ± S.D. from at least three independent injections or transfections of each mini-gene construct. Data groups were compared with Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by a Bonferroni t test for comparison of pairs of data points as appropriate using Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad). p < 0.05 was considered significant. We developed an in vivo (whole animal) mini-gene delivery system modeled after those used in transient gene delivery to skeletal and cardiac muscle (22Wolff J.A. Williams P. Acsadi G. Jiao S. Jani A. Chong W. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 474-485Google Scholar), taking advantage of the unique property of the gizzard as a solid smooth muscle organ, which could be directly injected with recombinant plasmid DNA. To optimize the experimental system, a plasmid containing the highly sensitive luciferase reporter driven by the viral RSV promoter was used. The naked plasmid DNA was directly injected into the gizzard of 1- to 7-day-old chicks as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Dose-response and time course data were generated (data not shown). The highest level of luciferase activity was observed 1 day after injection of 10 μg of plasmid DNA, and the activity decreased steadily between days 2 and 7. Injection of a plasmid with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) reporter demonstrated abundant expression of RFP in smooth muscle fibers in the region of injection (Fig.1 A). The smooth muscle fibers are identified by the presence of filamentous actin bound by phalloidin-FITC (Fig. 1 B). No red fluorescence was observed in regions remote from the site of injection (not shown), nor in control gizzards injected with pUC plasmid (Fig. 1 C). Dose-response experiments demonstrated a linear relationship between amount of injected plasmid DNA (from 1 to 50 μg) and luciferase activity (data not shown). Thus, transcripts arising from 25 μg of plasmid DNA injected into the gizzard were analyzed 1 day after injection in all subsequent experiments. We tested an MYPT1 mini-gene expression cassette that contained the chicken central alternative exon and flanking introns and exons (Fig. 2, A andB) in phasic and tonic SMCs and in a non-muscle (liver carcinoma) cell line. In the phasic SMCs (injected gizzard), 27 ± 4% of the spliced products generated from the MYPT1 mini-gene construct lacked the alternative exon (Fig. 2 C, lane 1). In contrast, in tonic SMCs (cultured gizzard SMCs), as well as in non-muscle cells (LMH cells), 11 ± 2% of transcripts generated from the MYPT1 mini-gene construct lacked the alternative exon (lanes 2 and 3).

https://openalex.org/W1965197125,"A chimeric D1A dopaminergic receptor harboring the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the D1B subtype (D1A-CTB) has been used previously to show that CT imparts high dopamine (DA) affinity and constitutive activity to the D1B receptors. However, the D1A-CTB chimera, unlike the D1B subtype, exhibits a significantly lower DA potency for stimulating adenylyl cyclase and a drastically lower maximal binding capacity (Bmax). Here, using a functional complementation of chimeric D1-like receptors, we have identified the human D1B receptor regions regulating the intramolecular relationships that lead to an increased DA potency and contribute to Bmax. We demonstrate that the addition of variant residues of the third extracellular loop (EL3) of the human D1B receptor into D1A-CTB chimera leads to a constitutively active mutant receptor displaying an increased DA affinity, potency, andBmax. These results strongly suggest that constitutively active D1-like receptors can adopt multiple active conformations, notably one that confers increased DA affinity with decreased DA potency and Bmax and another that imparts increased DA affinity with a strikingly increased DA potency and Bmax. Overall, we show that a novel molecular interplay between EL3 and CT regulates multiple active conformations of D1-like receptors and may have potential implications for other G protein-coupled receptor classes.

Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Google Scholar). D1-like receptors couple to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and in mammals are further divided into D1A (or D1) and D1B (or D5) subtypes. The D1B receptor distinguishes itself from the D1A subtype by a higher constitutive activity, increased affinity and potency for agonists, decreased affinity for antagonists, and a lower agonist-mediated maximal activation (2Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Google Scholar). Recently, a study highlighted the potential physiological relevance of the D1B receptor constitutive activity (3Lee D. Dong P. Copolov D. Lim A.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 344-352Google Scholar). Indeed, the extent of the D1B receptor constitutive activity controls the estrogen-induced mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor in primary hypothalamic neurons, a neuroendocrine process that potentially plays a role in D1B receptor-mediated facilitation of female sexual behavior (3Lee D. Dong P. Copolov D. Lim A.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 344-352Google Scholar). Moreover, the detection of D1-like subtype mRNA expression and/or activity in human breast and neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cells (4Lemmer K. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hopfner M. Hoegerle S. Faiss S. Grabowski P. Jockers-Scherubl M. Riecken E.O. Zeitz M. Scherubl H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 667-678Google Scholar, 5Riby J.E. Chang G.H. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 167-177Google Scholar) underscores the importance of these receptors as well as, potentially, their levels of constitutive activation in regulating DA function in pathophysiological conditions, as shown previously with other constitutively active mutant GPCRs (6Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Google Scholar). Thus, D1A and/or D1B subtype-specific ligands may help in the treatment of pathologies for which compromised D1-like receptor responsiveness is purported (7Jose P.A. Eisner G.M. Felder R.A. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2002; 4: 237-244Google Scholar, 8Goldman-Rakic P.S. Muly III, E.C. Williams G.V. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 31: 295-301Google Scholar, 9Emilien G. Maloteaux J.M. Geurts M. Hoogenberg K. Cragg S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 133-156Google Scholar). However, the structure-function relationships shaping the functional properties of the D1-like receptors remain unclear.Previously, we have shown that a structural domain (referred to as the terminal receptor locus (TRL)) encompassing the sixth and seventh transmembrane regions (TM6 and TM7), third extracellular loop (EL3) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) plays an important role in the phenotypic expression of ligand binding and G protein coupling properties of D1-like receptors (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). To narrow down the structural determinants within TRL involved in the subtype-specific ligand binding and G protein activation properties of the D1-like receptors, additional mutant receptors were constructed in which either the EL3 (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar) or CT sequences (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar) were swapped between the D1A and D1B receptors. Chimeric receptors harboring EL3 of their respective wild-type counterparts exhibited a complete reversal of agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC, whereas DA affinity and constitutive activity of the chimeras were only partially modulated by the exchange (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). In contrast, chimeric receptors harboring the CT of their respective wild-type counterparts displayed a full switch in DA affinity and constitutive activity, whereas DA potency decreased and agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC increased for both chimeras (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar). The decrease in DA potency is particularly intriguing for the constitutively active D1A-CTB chimera in light of its ability to bind DA with high affinity, reminiscent of the DA affinity for wild-type D1B receptors (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis studies revealed a previously unappreciated role of these receptor regions in determining the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of D1-like subtypes (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar, 11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar, 12Demchyshyn L.L. McConkey F. Niznik H.B. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1047-1058Google Scholar), a facet of the D1-like receptor function that may underlie the cognitive and working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia (14Okubo Y. Suhara T.

Martinez D. Huang Y. Hwang D.R. Keilp J. Kochan L. Van Heertum R. Gorman J.M. Laruelle M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3708-3719Google Scholar). Our previous findings hint at the complexity of intramolecular relationships within the TRL and indicate that discrete receptor regions responsible for regulating specific GPCR activation properties can be dissociated by mutations (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar, 11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar, 12Demchyshyn L.L. McConkey F. Niznik H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23446-23455Google Scholar, 13Chaar Z.Y. Jackson A. Tiberi M. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1047-1058Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies suggest the existence of multiple active conformations of constitutively active D1-like receptors, notably an active conformation imparting increased constitutive activity, DA affinity, and potency with unchanged Bmax (e.g. wild-type D1Bversus wild-type D1A receptors) or another conferring increased constitutive activity and DA affinity but decreased DA potency and Bmax (e.g. D1A-CTB chimeraversus wild-type D1-like receptors).In the present study, we tested whether EL3 and CT regions control the phenotypic expression of D1-like subtype-specific ligand binding and G protein coupling properties. To do so, we used a mutagenesis approach and functional complementation of different chimeric D1-like receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells to probe the potential molecular interplay between EL3 and CT regions. Here we report that a functional complementation of the constitutively active D1A-CTB chimera with the EL3 region of the D1B receptor leads to slight increase in DA affinity while causing a drastic increase in DA potency and Bmax. Thus, these results indicate the existence of distinct molecular interplay between the CT and EL3 involved in the regulation of discrete aspects of D1-like receptor signaling (e.g. multiple active conformations andBmax).DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we used a functional complementation of chimeric D1-like receptors to address the molecular interplay between an extracellular region, EL3, and an intracellular region, CT, in coordinating the functional properties (ligand binding, G protein coupling, and Bmax) of GPCRs and potentially their multiple active conformations. By constructing chimeric receptors in which EL3 and/or CT were exchanged between the D1A and D1B receptors, we were able to establish that interfering, synergistic, and additive intramolecular interactions put forth by these regions coordinate D1-like subtype-specific functional properties and multiple active GPCR conformations. It is also worth mentioning that the results obtained in the present study are not attributed to differences in the transfection efficiency of the different wild-type and chimeric receptor constructs. Indeed, we have obtained evidence that HEK 293 transfected with different epitope- or GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged versions of wild-type and chimeric dopamine receptor constructs show similar transfection efficiencies as assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (data not shown).The prime objective of our study was to explore the underlying molecular basis for constitutively active wild-type and chimeric forms of D1-like receptors displaying similar increased agonist affinity but unexpectedly divergent agonist potency. Such dissociation of DA potency and affinity deviates from one of the established paradigms for constitutively active mutant GPCRs, i.e. increased agonist affinity translates into increased agonist potency (2Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Google Scholar, 25Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Google Scholar, 26Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Google Scholar). An interesting finding from our studies is the potential role EL3 plays in controlling the CT-mediated regulation of D1-like subtype-specific DA potency in HEK 293 cells. Evidence pertaining to the role of EL3 in regulating the GPCR coupling function remains minimal (27Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Google Scholar). Interestingly, a study using EL3 chimeras made between the hamster β2-adrenergic receptor (Gs-coupled GPCR) and rat α1A-adrenergic receptor (Gq-coupled GPCR) has serendipitously found that EL3 can modulate β2-adrenergic receptor/G protein affinity (28Zhao M.M. Gaivin R.J. Perez D.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 524-529Google Scholar). In agreement with the latter study, we show that the partial modulation of DA potency induced by the different EL3 regions of D1-like receptors (increase for D1A-EL3B and decrease for D1B-EL3A) is consistent with the partial modulation of DA affinity observed herein and previously (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). Thus, we believe that the EL3 primary structure plays a key role in shaping the CT-induced intramolecular interactions regulating D1-like subtype-specific G protein coupling properties. Most importantly, this issue is best highlighted by the insertion of EL3 of the D1B subtype into the D1A-CTB chimera, which imparts to the constitutively active D1A-EL3CTB chimera an increased DA affinity and potency.Meanwhile, the CT region has also been shown to regulate agonist-induced phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization of several GPCR types including D1A receptors (29Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar, 30Lamey M. Thompson M. Varghese G. Chi H. Sawzdargo M. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9415-9421Google Scholar, 31Fredericks Z.L. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13796-13803Google Scholar, 32Heding A. Vrecl M. Bogerd J. McGregor A. Sellar R. Taylor P.L. Eidne K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11472-11477Google Scholar, 33Malecz N. Bambino T. Bencsik M. Nissenson R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1846-1856Google Scholar, 34Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Chaar Z.Y. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 683-697Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed loss of agonist potency of D1A-CTB chimera in HEK 293 cells could be explained potentially by a constitutive desensitization of the receptor. Indeed, there is evidence that constitutively active mutant GPCRs are subjected to desensitization in the absence of agonist stimulation (35Mhaouty-Kodja S. Barak L.S. Scheer A. Abuin L. Diviani D. Caron M.G. Cotecchia S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 339-347Google Scholar, 36Ren Q. Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16483-16487Google Scholar, 37Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Google Scholar). If constitutive desensitization plays a significant role in regulating DA potency in HEK 293 cells expressing D1A-CTB, this process is attenuated by the insertion of EL3 region of the D1B receptor into the D1A-CTB chimera as indexed by DA potency. At the present time, the issue of constitutive desensitization remains to be resolved fully. However, we believe that the loss of DA potency exhibited by the constitutively active D1A-CTB chimera is likely to be explained for the most part by CT-specific intramolecular interactions that underlie the agonist-induced receptor conformation for G protein coupling rather than constitutive or tonic desensitization. This idea is supported by our current and previous (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar) findings showing that DA-induced maximal stimulation of AC in HEK 293 cells expressing D1A-CTB is significantly increased instead of being decreased when compared with wild-type D1-like receptors or D1A-EL3CTB.In fact, the results presented herein pertaining to agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC address an important issue raised by our previous study showing that EL3 controls the extent of DA-mediated maximal activation of AC displayed by D1A and D1B receptors in HEK 293 cells (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). In striking contrast, the extent of DA-mediated maximal activation of AC (higher for D1A and lower for D1B) was not significantly changed by using chimeric receptors in which sequences composed of the TM6, TM7, EL3, and CT (TRL region) were switched between the D1A and D1B subtypes (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that in a similar fashion to TRL chimeras (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar), the constitutive activity was switched, whereas the extent of agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC was not affected by the exchange of both EL3 and CT regions. Thus, other structural determinants within the TRL of D1A and D1B receptors must prevent EL3 from regulating DA-mediated maximal activation of AC. Based on the results obtained with EL3CT chimeras, we propose that these structural determinants are located within the CT. Importantly, our data suggest that TM6 and TM7 residues do not prevent EL3 from exerting its effects on agonist-mediated maximal activation (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). In fact, our studies using D1A and D1B receptors harboring single-point mutations of their variant TM6 and TM7 residues support this assertion. Indeed, TM6 and TM7 single-point mutant receptors do not exhibit any major changes in their agonist-independent and -dependent activation properties. 2R. M. Iwasiow and M. Tiberi, unpublished data. Thus, EL3 and CT appear to impose on the overall receptor conformation interfering intramolecular interactions in controlling the extent of DA-mediated maximal activation of AC in HEK 293 cells.Furthermore, we have observed that the EL3 and CT regions play an important role in controlling the Bmax of D1A and D1B receptors in HEK 293 cells. For instance, the chimeric D1A-CTB receptor exhibited a drastically reduced Bmax, possibly reflective of its high constitutive activity profile, although the wild-type D1B receptor did not show a lower Bmax value in comparison with HEK 293 cells expressing the wild-type D1A subtype. Meanwhile, marked structural instability has been reported as a result of constitutive activation of mutant GPCRs (24Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Google Scholar, 38Samama P. Bond R.A. Rockman H.A. Milano C.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 137-141Google Scholar, 39Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Google Scholar). Thus, one likely possibility is that swapping of the CT region of D1A subtype with that of the D1B receptor imparts a decreased structural stability to the D1A-CTB chimera, which is functionally rescued by an insertion of the EL3B region (D1A-EL3CTB chimera). It is also worth mentioning that the Bmax values of D1-like chimeras measured in transfected HEK 293 cells may also depend on the rates of both receptor synthesis and degradation (40Edwards S.W. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16331-16336Google Scholar, 41Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Google Scholar). Potentially, the EL3 and/or CT regions may play an important role in controlling the rate of D1-like chimera degradation through GPCR internalization-independent and -dependent processes (29Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24Google Scholar, 42Jockers R. Angers S. Da Silva A. Benaroch P. Strosberg A.D. Bouvier M. Marullo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28900-28908Google Scholar, 43Tsao P. Cao T. von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Google Scholar).Taken together, the findings of our study suggest that the EL3 and CT regions regulate D1-like subtype-specific ligand binding and G protein coupling properties. However, the conformational determinants may also require residues located outside of the TRL, notably for agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC. Furthermore, the distinct molecular interplay between EL3 and CT may also underlie the multiple active conformations adopted by constitutively active D1-like subtypes. These subtypes can be grouped into receptors displaying increased DA affinity with decreased DA potency and Bmax (D1A-CTB chimera), increased DA affinity with increased DA potency andBmax (D1A-EL3B chimera), or increased DA affinity with increased DA potency and unchanged Bmax (wild-type D1B receptors and D1A-EL3CTB chimera). The topological locations of EL3 and CT suggest that they may serve as conformational switches in α-helical packing and/or movement/tilting of the TM6 and TM7 of D1A and D1B receptors, a biophysical process involved in rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptor activation (27Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Google Scholar, 44Javitch J.A. Fu D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Google Scholar, 45Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H.

Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1338-1345Google Scholar).In conclusion, our study has clearly demonstrated that a set of molecular interactions between EL3 and CT of the D1A and D1B receptors controls the underlying spatial relationships of D1-like subtype-specific active conformations. Whether acting together or against each other, these interactions define the spatial relationships underlying DA binding, as well as the agonist-dependent and -independent G protein coupling properties of D1-like receptors. Further studies are under way in our laboratory to identify specific residues of the CT and EL3 that participate in the formation of these intramolecular bonds. Finally, our results may be of potential physiological relevance for the treatment of pathological conditions caused by a compromised D1-like receptor function (9Emilien G. Maloteaux J.M. Geurts M. Hoogenberg K. Cragg S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 133-156Google Scholar). This issue is further underscored by the identification of missense and nonsense mutations in the EL3 region of the D1B receptor, which may play a role in the phenotypic expression of neuropsychiatric disorders (55Sobell J.L.

Sommer S.S. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 81: 172-178Google Scholar). Dopamine (DA)1 elicits its physiological and endocrine effects through the interaction with D1-like and D2-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) subfamilies (1Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Google Scholar). D1-like receptors couple to the activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and in mammals are further divided into D1A (or D1) and D1B (or D5) subtypes. The D1B receptor distinguishes itself from the D1A subtype by a higher constitutive activity, increased affinity and potency for agonists, decreased affinity for antagonists, and a lower agonist-mediated maximal activation (2Tiberi M. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27925-27931Google Scholar). Recently, a study highlighted the potential physiological relevance of the D1B receptor constitutive activity (3Lee D. Dong P. Copolov D. Lim A.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 344-352Google Scholar). Indeed, the extent of the D1B receptor constitutive activity controls the estrogen-induced mRNA expression of atrial natriuretic factor in primary hypothalamic neurons, a neuroendocrine process that potentially plays a role in D1B receptor-mediated facilitation of female sexual behavior (3Lee D. Dong P. Copolov D. Lim A.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 344-352Google Scholar). Moreover, the detection of D1-like subtype mRNA expression and/or activity in human breast and neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumor cells (4Lemmer K. Ahnert-Hilger G. Hopfner M. Hoegerle S. Faiss S. Grabowski P. Jockers-Scherubl M. Riecken E.O. Zeitz M. Scherubl H. Life Sci. 2002; 71: 667-678Google Scholar, 5Riby J.E. Chang G.H. Firestone G.L. Bjeldanes L.F. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 60: 167-177Google Scholar) underscores the importance of these receptors as well as, potentially, their levels of constitutive activation in regulating DA function in pathophysiological conditions, as shown previously with other constitutively active mutant GPCRs (6Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Google Scholar). Thus, D1A and/or D1B subtype-specific ligands may help in the treatment of pathologies for which compromised D1-like receptor responsiveness is purported (7Jose P.A. Eisner G.M. Felder R.A. Curr. Hypertens. Rep. 2002; 4: 237-244Google Scholar, 8Goldman-Rakic P.S. Muly III, E.C. Williams G.V. Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2000; 31: 295-301Google Scholar, 9Emilien G. Maloteaux J.M. Geurts M. Hoogenberg K. Cragg S. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 133-156Google Scholar). However, the structure-function relationships shaping the functional properties of the D1-like receptors remain unclear. Previously, we have shown that a structural domain (referred to as the terminal receptor locus (TRL)) encompassing the sixth and seventh transmembrane regions (TM6 and TM7), third extracellular loop (EL3) and cytoplasmic tail (CT) plays an important role in the phenotypic expression of ligand binding and G protein coupling properties of D1-like receptors (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). To narrow down the structural determinants within TRL involved in the subtype-specific ligand binding and G protein activation properties of the D1-like receptors, additional mutant receptors were constructed in which either the EL3 (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar) or CT sequences (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar) were swapped between the D1A and D1B receptors. Chimeric receptors harboring EL3 of their respective wild-type counterparts exhibited a complete reversal of agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC, whereas DA affinity and constitutive activity of the chimeras were only partially modulated by the exchange (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar). In contrast, chimeric receptors harboring the CT of their respective wild-type counterparts displayed a full switch in DA affinity and constitutive activity, whereas DA potency decreased and agonist-mediated maximal activation of AC increased for both chimeras (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar). The decrease in DA potency is particularly intriguing for the constitutively active D1A-CTB chimera in light of its ability to bind DA with high affinity, reminiscent of the DA affinity for wild-type D1B receptors (11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar). Moreover, mutagenesis studies revealed a previously unappreciated role of these receptor regions in determining the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of D1-like subtypes (10Iwasiow R.M. Nantel M.F. Tiberi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31882-31890Google Scholar, 11Jackson A. Iwasiow R.M. Tiberi M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 183-188Google Scholar, 12Demchyshyn L.L. McConkey F. Niznik H.B. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1047-1058Google Scholar), a facet of the D1-like receptor function that may underlie the cognitive and working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia (14Okubo Y. Suhara T.

We provide evidence that the erythroid-specific enhancer- binding protein NF-E2 interacts with the cognate motif at DNase I-hypersensitive site 2 of the human β-globin locus control region in a repressive state. The nucleosome containing the NF-E2-binding site showed characteristic rotational and translational phases in vitro. The binding site had less affinity to the histone octamers than nearby regions while showing greater accessibility to DNase I and micrococcal nuclease. Furthermore, the motif was recognized by the exogenous NF-E2 protein expressed in HeLa cells, which have a repressive state of chromatin at the β-globin locus, as shown by ligation-mediated PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay.

The expression of these genes is restricted to erythroid tissues and regulated in a developmental stage-specific manner (1Karlsson S. Nienhuis A.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 1071-1108Google Scholar). The human β-LCR confers high level and tissue-specific expression to the β-globin genes and is marked by erythroid-specific, DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS-1 to HS-4), which lie 6–18 kb upstream of the β-globin gene and function together (2Tuan D. Solomon W. Li Q. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6384-6388Google Scholar). In thalassemia DNA with large deletions encompassing the LCR and the upstream sequence, expression of the downstream globin genes is abolished, and the chromatin structure of the locus becomes resistant to DNase I cleavage (3Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Google Scholar), which suggests that the LCR mediates activation of transcription of the genes at different stages in development in conjunction with modification of the chromatin structure. Transgenic mouse studies have also indicated that the LCR provides an open, accessible chromatin structure regardless of where on the genome the transgenic gene is integrated and can confer position-independent expression to the integrated globin gene (4Grosveld F. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1999; 9: 152-157Google Scholar). In addition to its enhancer activity, the LCR is important for establishing the timing of DNA replication of the β-globin locus during the S phase of the cell cycle (3Forrester W.C. Epner E. Driscoll M.C. Enver T. Brice M. Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Google Scholar, 5Kitsberg D. Selig S. Keshet I. Cedar H.

A central question in developmental biology is how enhancers activate gene transcription in a tissue- and developmental stage-specific fashion, a complex process that takes place in the chromatin environment of the nucleus. Most efforts to elucidate the function of the LCR have focused on identifying the transcription factors, and many of the erythroid-specific transcription factors with conserved binding sites in the LCR have been clarified. These include NF-E2 (7Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Davidson M.B. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1993; 362: 722-728Google Scholar, 8Andrews N.C. Kotkow K.J. Ney P.A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11488-11492Google Scholar), GATA-1 (9Martin D.I. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1886-1898Google Scholar, 10Trainor C.D. Evans T. Felsenfeld G. Boguski M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 92-96Google Scholar, 11Tsai S.F. Martin D.I. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 446-451Google Scholar), and erythroid Krüppel-like factor (12Miller I.J. Bieker J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2776-2786Google Scholar). Among them, NF-E2 plays a key role in the function of the LCR. NF-E2, a bZIP transcription factor, is a heterodimer of 45- and 18-kDa subunits. Expression of NF-E2 p45 is primarily restricted to erythroid cells, whereas NF-E2 p18 appears to be ubiquitously expressed. There appears to be considerable functional redundancy among polypeptides that recognize NF-E2 sites, and whereas the p18–p45 NF-E2 dimer itself may be required to activate globin gene expression, other species may be able to participate in the formation of the HSs (13Kotkow K.J. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4640-4647Google Scholar). The overall stimulatory activity of the LCR (at least of HS2) in the chromatin environment of transgenic mice or in stably integrated constructs appears to depend on NF-E2 motifs (14Caterina J.J. Ryan T.M. Pawlik K.M. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1626-1630Google Scholar, 15Caterina J.J. Ciavatta D.J. Donze D. Behringer R.R. Townes T.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1006-1011Google Scholar, 16Ellis J. Talbot D. Dillon N. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 127-134Google Scholar, 17Liu D. Chang J.C. Moi P. Liu W. Kan Y.W.

From a series of studies using transgenic mice with the β-globin yeast artificial chromosome, it was suggested that the deletion of HS elements markedly reduced the expression of all of the globin genes at all developmental stages accompanying the malformation of DNase I hypersensitivity in the LCR (19Li G. Lim K.C. Engel J.D. Bungert J. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 415-429Google Scholar). In addition, it was also shown that the protein Bach1, which heterodimerizes with the p18 NF-E2 subunit and interacts with the Maf-responsive element (MARE) or NF-E2-binding site sequences at HS2, HS3, and HS4, is able to cross-link HS sites, thereby looping out intervening DNA regions (20Yoshida C. Tokumasu F. Hohmura K.I. Bungert J. Hayashi N. Nagasawa T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Takeyasu K. Igarashi K. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 643-655Google Scholar). These results suggest that a series of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions establishes the formation of a larger LCR complex (21Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-E2 is critically involved in remodeling the nucleosome structure over the HS2 region, where it interacts with the tandem MARE sites (22Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Google Scholar, 23Gong Q.H. McDowell J.C. Dean A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6055-6064Google Scholar). In contrast with the study supporting a role for NF-E2 in β-globin gene expression, p45 NF-E2 null mice had nearly normal levels of β-globin protein (24Shivdasani R.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8690-8694Google Scholar), and deletion of HS2 had no significant effect on the timing or extent of expression of the gene (25Fiering S. Epner E. Robinson K. Zhuang Y. Telling A. Hu M. Martin D.I. Enver T. Ley T.J. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2203-2213Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported (26Reik A. Telling A. Zitnik G. Cimbora D. Epner E. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5992-6000Google Scholar, 27Bender M.A. Bulger M. Close J. Groudine M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 387-393Google Scholar) that the chromatin-opening function of the LCR may not be the primary activity at the endogenous mouse or human globin locus, because the LCR can be deleted without affecting general sensitivity to DNase I. Although the mechanism of long range transactivation by the LCR is still poorly understood, it is true that the LCR is required for conferring high level globin gene expression throughout erythroid development. Previously, we determined the nucleosome phases around HS2, and we found that there are two major nucleosome positions in the HS2 regionin vivo (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). The −60 to +85 phase had a nucleosome dyad axis at its center, where the tandem MARE sites were located, and included the binding sites of the erythroid-specific transcription factors HS2NF5 and GATA-1. This phase was shown to be the only phase in HeLa cells, and thus, this is the original state where NF-E2 first interacts with the cognate motif. In contrast, the −100 to +45 phase and several other minor phases were present in erythroid K562 cells. In this state, the region containing HS2NF5 and GATA-1-binding sites was partially or completely open resulting in an increased accessibility to these factors. Furthermore, we also reported that the enhancer activity at HS2 of the human β-LCR can be modulated by the curved DNA located at a distance of two nucleosomes from HS2 and regulates nearby nucleosome phases as a key nucleosome (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar). In this paper, we concentrated on characterizing the nucleosome structure over HS2, in particular NF-E2 binding, and we demonstrated that NF-E2 interacts with the cognate motif on the nucleosome before chromatin is remodeled. Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Cell culture materials were obtained from Invitrogen. Other chemicals used were of the highest quality commercially available and were purchased from Sigma. Nucleosome core particles were prepared from chicken erythrocytes as described previously (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). After the preparation of core particles by gel filtration through Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Biosciences), the histone octamers were prepared according to the method of Luger et al. (30Luger K. Mäder A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Google Scholar). Briefly, the core particles were applied to a hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 0.6 m NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.2 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and the column was washed first with 0.65m NaCl, 50 mm Na/PO4 (pH 6.0), 0.25 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and then with 65 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na/PO4, 0.25 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The octamer was eluted with 2.5 m NaCl, 50 mmNa/PO4 (pH 6.0), 0.25 mm PMSF, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and dialyzed against 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 m NaCl, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Nucleosomes were reconstituted onto DNA fragments either by exchanging them with the DNA from the histone core particles or by dialysis with the histone octamer. The nucleosomes were reconstituted in vitro using the end-labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the −100 to +45 and −60 to +85 nucleosome phases, respectively. MNase digestion was performed at a final concentration of 0.025 units/ml at 25 °C for 2 and 5 min. DNA was purified and electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The nucleosomes were reconstitutedin vitro using a DNA fragment containing the entire HS2 region (−10,989 to −10,769 relative to the cap site of the ε-globin gene) and treated with MNase as described previously (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). The ∼146-bp fragments were recovered from 6% polyacrylamide gels and digested with restriction enzymes. DNA was electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto the membrane. Hybridization and detection were performed as described previously (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar). The probe was the same DNA fragment used in nucleosome reconstitution. The three-dimensional structure of the DNA curvature was predicted with TRIF 1.00 software (sgjsl.weizmann.ac.il/usr/users/Curvature) as described previously (31Shpigelman E.S. Trifonov E.N. Bolshoy A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 435-440Google Scholar). Nucleosomes were reconstituted with 32P-labeled or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled DNA in the presence or absence of competitor DNA by dialysis as described above. Aliquots (10 μl) of the reconstituted nucleosomes were suspended in 20 μl of 16 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm KCl, 16% (v/v) glycerol, 1.6 mmMgCl2, 0.8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm PMSF, 1 mm EDTA, 0.8 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 0.06 mg/ml of poly(dI-dC), and 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and mixed with 5 μl of 30 (v/v) glycerol dye. These mixtures were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels in 40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, and 5% glycerol. Nucleosomes reconstituted with the end-labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the −60 to +85 nucleosome phase were cleaved with the hydroxyl radical as described (32Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Churchill M.E.A. Kam L. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 537-558Google Scholar, 33Hayes J.J. Tullius T.D. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7405-7409Google Scholar). Briefly, the footprinting reaction was initiated by adding an Fe(II) EDTA solution (10 μl), which was prepared immediately before use by mixing equal volumes of freshly prepared 125 mmFe(II) and 250 mm EDTA, and 28 mm sodium ascorbate (10 μl) and 0.84% hydrogen peroxide (10 μl) on the inner wall of the tube containing the reconstituted nucleosomes. The reaction was allowed to run for 2 min and then quenched by adding 0.1m thiourea (10 μl), 0.2 m EDTA (2 μl), tRNA (10 μg), and 0.5% SDS (30 μl). The DNA was extracted with phenol, recovered by ethanol precipitation, and resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Nucleosomes reconstituted with end-labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the −60 to +85 nucleosome phase were cleaved with DNase I as described previously (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar). After purification, DNA was resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gel under denaturing conditions. LM-PCRs were carried out as described (34Pfeifer G.P. Chen H.H. Komura J. Riggs A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 548-571Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were transfected with or without the plasmids containing NF-E2 subunits, p18 or p45 (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar), and cultured in minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 24 h. Cells were treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link proteins and DNA, rinsed with PBS twice, and then incubated with 0.2% dimethyl sulfate at 20 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of 1.5 m sodium acetate (pH 7.0) and 1 m mercaptoethanol followed by washing with PBS twice. The cells were then suspended in 1% SDS and 0.1m NaHCO3 and heated at 65 °C for 4 h to untie the cross-links. After preparation of the genomic DNA, piperidine was added at 90 °C for 30 min to ensure strand breakage. DNA was then purified and used for first strand synthesis extending up to the cleaved sites using the primer (5′-TTACAAGCTCAGCTCCCTCTATCC-3′). The synthesized DNA was ligated to the double-stranded linker oligonucleotides (5′-GAATTCAGATC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′) and amplified by PCR. The PCR primers were 5′-TCCCTCTATCCCTTCCAGCATCC-3′ and 5′-GCGGTGACCCGGGAGATCTGAATTC-3′. The conditions for PCR were 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a 10-min extension. Linear amplification of the digested fragment was carried out by PCR primer extension with a32P-end-labeled primer (5′-CCAGCATCCTCATCTCTGATTAAATAAGC-3′: −11,043 to −11,015 relative to the cap site of the ε-globin gene), and the amplified fragments were resolved on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The assay followed a procedure published previously (35Boyd K.E. Wells J. Gutman J. Bartley S.M. Farnham P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13887-13892Google Scholar, 36Forsberg E.C. Downs K.M. Brensnick E.H. Blood. 2000; 96: 334-339Google Scholar). K562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After the introduction of plasmids, HeLa cells were cultured as mentioned above. Cells were then treated with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature to cross-link proteins and DNA before being rinsed with PBS twice. The cells were lysed by adding 150 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, and 1 mm PMSF) and were allowed to incubate on ice for 10 min. Sonication was followed by centrifugation, and the supernatants containing soluble chromatin were collected after digestion with or without MNase. The chromatin solution was cleared with salmon sperm DNA and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h before overnight incubation with 10 μg of anti-NF-E2 (p45) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fifty microliters of 50% protein A-Sepharose was added to the samples and incubation carried out at 4 °C for 2 h followed by centrifugation. The pellets were washed three times, once in 150 μl of wash buffer 1 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), once with 150 μl of wash buffer 2 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mmNaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), and once in 150 μl of wash buffer 3 (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.25m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA). Each wash was performed at 4 °C for 10 min. Next, the samples were washed 3 times with 200 μl of TE buffer. The immunocomplexes were then eluted off with 1% SDS and 0.1 mNaHCO3 and heated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-links. The cross-links of DNA input samples were reversed in a similar manner. DNA from the samples was purified and subjected to PCR. The primers 5′-GGTCAGTGCCCCACCCCCGCCTT-3′ and 5′-AGATAGGAGTCATCACTCTAGG-3′ were used for amplification of a 150-bp fragment of HS2 and 5′-AGGATAGACATGCAGAAATGCATTTTAAAAATC-3′ and 5′-GTTAGGGCGCACATGGGTGTTCATGCCTTCC-3′ for that of a 197-bp fragment (positions −975 to −779) of the human estrogen receptor α (ERα) gene (37Li X. Onishi Y. Kuwabara K. Rho J. Wada-Kiyama Y. Sakuma Y. Kiyama R. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 279-290Google Scholar). PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The HS2 region is very important for β-globin gene expression and contains many transcription factor binding sites, NF-E2 and GATA-1, for example (Fig.1 A). The binding of these factors to their cognate motifs is critical in regulating the gene expression, suggesting that it is crucial to investigate the status of these cis-elements around the HS2 region. We have previously reported (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar) that there were two major nucleosome phases at HS2in vivo. One is the −60 to +85 phase which has a nucleosome dyad axis at its center, where the tandem MAREs are located, and the other is the −100 to +45 phase. We have also reported that the translational phase of the nucleosome containing the tandem MAREs and the enhancer activity was modulated by the curved DNA located at a distance of two nucleosomes from HS2 (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar). First, we analyzed the translational phase of the nucleosomes at HS2 when the effect from the key nucleosome was absent. As shown in Fig. 1 A, we used two end-labeled DNA fragments corresponding to the −100 to +45 and −60 to +85 nucleosome phases, respectively, for reconstitution of the nucleosomes in vitro. After their reconstitution, the nucleosomes were treated with MNase and then resolved on 4% native polyacrylamide gel. Interestingly, the band of the nucleosome containing the 5′-end-labeled DNA fragment corresponding to the −100 to +45 nucleosome phase disappeared immediately after MNase digestion, whereas the bands containing the other DNA fragments remained undigested, indicating that the 5′-region of the DNA fragment corresponding to the −100 to +45 nucleosome phase did not bind to histone octamers but was free because this region was not protected from MNase digestion (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest that the nucleosome over the HS2 region bore a propensity to show a specific position. To determine the exact translational phase, the ∼146-bp core DNA fragments were recovered after MNase digestion from the nucleosomes reconstituted in vitro using a 200-bp DNA fragment containing whole regions of the −100 to +45 and −60 to +85 phases and were analyzed by restriction digestion. As shown in Fig.1 C, Sau96I did not create any digested bands, whereas BspHI and BfaI produced mainly two bands of ∼70 and 120 bp, respectively, suggesting that the major translational phases were −60 to +85. In BspHI orBfaI digests, some minor bands were observed, indicating that several minor phases were also present in this region as we reported previously (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). The position shown here in the nucleosome reconstituted in vitro was almost identical to the −60 to +85 phase observed as in a repressive state in HeLa cells. The results are summarized in Fig. 1 D. Previously, we reported that DNA bend sites around εB-17 and εB-16 showed nucleosome positioning activity with almost unique phases, respectively (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). The positions of the neighboring nucleosomes were abolished after removal of these sites (29Onishi Y. Kiyama R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 3448-3457Google Scholar). Here the HS2 region also showed several preferential nucleosome positions (Fig. 1), although typical curved DNA was not found by circular permutation assay (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). In contrast, TRIF 1.00 computer software (31Shpigelman E.S. Trifonov E.N. Bolshoy A. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1993; 9: 435-440Google Scholar) predicted significant DNA curvatures not only in the regions containing εB-17 and εB-16 but also at HS2, although the HS2 region showed right-handed superhelicity, whereas both εB-17 and εB-16 showed left-handed superhelicity (middle in Fig.2). The B, NF30, and E subregions in εB-17, HS2, and εB-16, respectively, contained curved DNA. When we performed a competition assay (bottom in Fig. 2), the oligonucleotides containing these subregions did not compete strongly in nucleosome formation, whereas those from the immediate vicinity (C in εB-17, B and C in HS2, and D in εB-16) showed the strongest competition in each region. These results suggest that the NF30 fragment in the HS2 region that had curved DNA with right-handed superhelicity bound to the histone octamer less tightly than the other subregions. We next examined the accessibility to MNase of these fragments in the nucleosome (Fig. 3). We subcloned HS2 fragments, A–D and NF30, which had been used as competitors (Fig. 2), into pBluescript SK+ and reconstituted nucleosomes in vitrousing the 305-bp fragments from these subclones as probes. As shown in Fig. 3 A, all constructs, including the DNA fragment without an insert, showed similar band intensities at the mononucleosome position, indicating that there was little, if any, difference in nucleosome formation among these constructs. However, when the nucleosomes reconstituted in vitro were digested with MNase and the ∼146-bp core DNA fragments recovered were analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, only the nucleosome containing the NF30 fragment showed little recovery of the core DNA (shown by an arrowhead in Fig.3 B), which was even less than that from the nucleosome with a pBluescript fragment. Because the DNA fragments used in nucleosome reconstitution in this experiment had the same DNA sequence except for the 30-bp insert regions and showed nucleosome formation at the same level, the difference in MNase sensitivity should be attributable to the insert. These results suggest that the NF-30 fragment containing the tandem MAREs was more accessible to MNase on the nucleosome and did not bind to the histone octamer tightly. To confirm whether the NF30 region has a similar structure on the nucleosome at HS2, we first determined the rotational phase of the nucleosome reconstituted with the DNA fragment corresponding to the −60 to +85 phase. Fig.4 shows the results of hydroxyl radical footprinting, where a 10-bp ladder pattern characteristic of the rotational phases of nucleosomes was observed. In the NF30 region, some of the nucleotides at each NF-E2-binding site showed accessibility to hydroxyl radicals, indicating that a part of the NF-E2-binding site faces outside of the histone octamer. A simple calculation based on hydroxyl radical footprinting results (Fig. 4) predicted that DNA wrapped around the histone core had an average number of 10.2 bp per helical turn, which agreed with the corresponding number from the nucleosomes in general (38Wolffe A. Chromatin: Structure and Function. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1995: 6-38Google Scholar). Next, we performed DNase I footprinting to analyze the accessibility to nuclease of the tandem MAREs on the nucleosome. The periodic 10-bp cleavage sites shown as open triangles in Fig. 5 were observed, and many other cleaved sites (closed circle in Fig. 5), in particular on the antisense strand, were present within the tandem MAREs. The existence of such nuclease-sensitive sites agreed with the results in Fig. 3. These findings suggest that the tandem MAREs on the nucleosome at HS2 are acceptable for the binding of NF- E2 by facilitating interaction with NF-E2.Figure 5DNase I footprinting analysis of the nucleosome containing the −60 to +85 nucleosome phase. Vertical bars and square brackets indicate the tandem MAREs, and closed circles indicate the nucleotides showing high sensitivity to DNase I within the tandem MAREs. Open triangles show the periodic 10-bp cleavage sites indicating rotational nucleosome phases.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that NF-E2 can bind to its cognate motifs while it is located on the nucleosome, we performed a DMS LM-PCR using non-erythroid HeLa cells. We have already determined nucleosome positions around the HS2 region in active and inactive states using K562 and HeLa cells, respectively (28Onishi Y. Wada-Kiyama Y. Kiyama R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 989-1004Google Scholar). HeLa cells do not express the β-like globin genes and exhibit a packed chromatin structure at this locus as revealed by the absence of the erythroid-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites. The translational phase at HS2 in HeLa cells mainly showed the −60 to +85 phase which is the same as observed in the nucleosome reconstituted in vitro (Fig. 1). After introducing NF-E2 expression plasmids in HeLa cells, the binding of NF-E2 to its cognate motif on the nucleosome in vivo was analyzed by genomic DMS footprinting followed by LM-PCR. Gel patterns of the antisense strand of HS2 after LM-PCR with DNA from the NF-E2-expressing or non-expressing cells are shown in Fig.6. Note that the antisense strand exhibits more prominent footprinting patterns than the sense strand (39Reddy P.M.S. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Shen C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8287-8295Google Scholar). The positions of guanine nucleotides, the targets of DMS modification, matched very well those of the cleaved bands except for the region at the tandem MAREs in cells expressing NF-E2. The region showed significant protection against methylation. Ikuta and Kan (40Ikuta T. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10188-10192Google Scholar) and Reddy and Shen (41Reddy P.M.S. Shen C.-K.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8676-8680Google Scholar) reported that the binding of NF-E2 to its motif generated hyper-reactive patterns of guanine nucleotides within and flanking the tandem MAREs in K562 cells. Previously, we also reported that inducing NF-E2 expression in HeLa cells generated an increased DNase I sensitivity at the MAREs perhaps corresponding to the changes in the chromatin structure (29Onishi Y.

Sequencing of the N-terminal end confirmed the 10 first amino acids deduced from the nucleotide sequence. Its domain structure has been investigated using limited proteolysis and active site labeling. Trypsin and elastase were used to cleave the multienzyme, and the location of fragments within the primary structure was established by N-terminal sequence analysis. Initial proteolysis generated two fragments: an N-terminal fragment housing the adenylation and the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domains (116 kDa) and a second fragment containing most of the reductive domain (28 kDa). Under harsher conditions the adenylation domain (about 64 kDa) and the PCP domain (30 kDa) become separated. Time-dependent acylation of α-AAR and of fragments containing the adenylation domain with tritiated α-aminoadipate occurred in vitro in the absence of NADPH. Addition of NADPH to the labeled α-AAR released most of the radioactive substrate. A fragment containing the adenylation domain was labeled even in absence of the PCP box. The labeling of this fragment (lacking PCP) was always weaker than that observed in the di-domain (adenylating and PCP) fragment suggesting that the PCP domain plays a role in the stability of the acyl intermediate. Low intensity direct acylation of the PCP box has also been observed. A domain structure of this multienzyme is proposed.

CRC Crit. Rev. Microbiol. 1985; 12: 131-151Google Scholar, 2Nishida H. Nishiyama M. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 51: 299-302Google Scholar), a biosynthetic route that starts with the condensation of acetyl-CoA and α-ketoglutarate to form homocitrate (3Luengo J.M. Revilla G. Villanueva J.R. Martı́n J.F. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 144: 869-876Google Scholar), which is later subjected to isomerization (4Weidner G. Steffan B. Brakhage A.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 237-245Google Scholar), 2F. Teves, J. Casqueiro, and J. F. Martı́n, unpublished results. oxidative decarboxylation and amination to yield α-AA. This intermediate is then converted into α-AA-δ-semialdehyde by the action of the α-aminoadipate reductase (α-AAR, EC 1.2.1.31) encoded by thelys2 and lys5 genes. The product of thelys2 gene constitutes the apoenzyme, whereas thelys5 product appears to be a specific phosphopantetheinyl transferase for post-translational modification of Lys2 (5Ehmann D.E. Gehring A.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6171-6177Google Scholar, 6Guo S. Evans S.A. Wilkes M.B. Bhattacharjee J.K. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7120-7125Google Scholar). The α-AAR, also called α-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, first activates the α-AA δ-carboxyl group by an ATP-dependent process through the formation of an α-AA-adenylate, a unique step among amino acid biosynthetic pathways, that is then reduced by the reduction domain using NADPH to yield α-AA-δ-semialdehyde and AMP. In filamentous fungi, α-AA is not only an essential intermediate in lysine biosynthesis but also a well-known precursor in the biosynthesis of β-lactam antibiotics (7Demain A.L. Demain A.L.

It constitutes the branching point for lysine and penicillin or cephalosporin biosynthesis, where it is condensed with l-valine and l-cysteine to form the tripeptide δ-l-(α-aminoadipyl)-l-cysteinyl-d-valine (ACV) by the ACV synthetase (10Banko G.

Gutiérrez S. Bañuelos O. Fierro F. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 549-556Google Scholar) on the basis of sequence comparison analyses with other α-AARs (16Morris M.E.

The α-AAR also shows a striking similarity with non-ribosomal peptide synthetases in the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein and NAD-dependent dehydrogenases in the last third of the enzyme. However, direct evidence for the topology and domain structure of native α-AAR enzymes has never been achieved, in part due to the lack of efficient purification protocols. Some purification attempts have been described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Storts D.R. Bhattacharjee J.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 161: 416-418Google Scholar) and P. chrysogenum (21Lu Y. Mach R.L. Affenzeller K. Kubicek C.P. Can. J. Microbiol. 1992; 38: 758-763Google Scholar) native enzymes; however, purification to homogeneity has never been previously attained. Limited proteolysis (22Rosmann M.G. Argos P. Annu. Rev.

This work provides structural and functional evidence of the domains of the α-AAR in comparison with the domains occurring in the α-AA activating domains of the five known ACV synthetases. l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated bovine trypsin, elastase, thyoglycollic acid (mercaptoacetic acid), and 3-cyclohexylamino-1-propanesulfonic acid buffer were purchased from Sigma;dl-α-[3H]aminoadipic acid (38 Ci mmol−1) was synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. The expression vector pGEX-2T and Sephadex G-25, protein A-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, Sephacryl S-300, DEAE-Sepharose, Superose 6, and Superose 12 columns and high range molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were from Amersham Biosciences; the immunoaffinity column was prepared using the Affi-Gel Hz system (Bio-Rad Laboratories); ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and sequencing reagents were from Applied Biosystems Inc. All other reagents were from commercial sources and of analytical grade. P. chrysogenum AMA, a strain derived from P. chrysogenum Wis 54-1255 pyrG, which overexpresseslys2 in an autonomous replicating plasmid 3F. J. Casqueiro and J. F. Martı́n, unpublished data. was used as α-AAR source to purify this enzyme. Sporulation in PW medium and growth in DPM medium was performed as described elsewhere (24Hijarrubia M.J. Aparicio J.F. Martı́n J.F. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 59: 270-277Google Scholar). Standard genetic techniques with Escherichia coli andin vitro DNA manipulations were as described by Sambrook and Russell (25Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reactions were performed usingPfu DNA polymerase as described by the enzyme supplier (Stratagene). DNA sequencing was accomplished by the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences Amplitaq Dye-terminator sequencing system on double-stranded DNA templates with an Applied Biosystems model 310 sequencer (Foster City, CA). Crude enzyme preparations were obtained by grinding the cells in liquid nitrogen and suspending them in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The extract was then dialyzed (cellulose membranes,M r 12,000) against the same buffer at 4 °C to remove possible low molecular weight enzyme inhibitors. The α-AAR activity was assessed by the procedure of Sagisaka and Shimura (26Sagisaka S. Shimura K. J. Biochem. 1962; 52: 155-161Google Scholar), as described by Suvarna et al. (18Suvarna K. Seah L. Bhattacharjee V. Bhattacharjee J.K. Curr. Genet. 1998; 33: 268-275Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 12.5 mm α-AA , 15 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.625 mm β-NADPH, 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, and an appropriate amount of enzyme solution, in a total volume of 1 ml. Reaction mixtures lacking α-AA were used as controls. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for up to 1 h and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of 2%p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 2-methoxyethanol. The enzyme activity was determined by quantifying the formation of α-AA-δ-semialdehyde as previously described (19Hijarrubia M.J. Aparicio J.F. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 755-762Google Scholar). The α-AA-δ-semialdehyde forms a yellow complex withp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (λmax = 460 nm). One unit of α-AAR is defined as the activity that gives an increase of absorbance at 460 nm of 0.01 per min. Two fragments of Lys2 were chosen for the generation of antibodies, one spanning from Gly302 to Pro763(peptide A) and the second one from Gly402 to Ser1292 (peptide B). The DNA encoding both fragments was amplified using PCR methods from plasmid pBL2, which contains the lys2 gene from P. chrysogenum(15Casqueiro J. Gutiérrez S. Bañuelos O. Fierro F. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 549-556Google Scholar), using the following primers: 1) 5′-ACGAATTCATGGCATTCAGCGGGGCGAG-3′, 2) 5′-ACGAATTCAGGTACAAAGTAGCTGAC-3′, and 3) 5′-ACGAATTCGGAAGTAGACCAAGGCAC-3′ (EcoRI site underlined). The PCR product resulting from amplification with primers 1 and 2 (1383 bp) was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pGEX-2T to give pGEXA. Similarly, pGEXB was obtained by cloning of theBamHI-EcoRI-digested PCR product resulting from amplification with primers 1 and 3 (2988 bp) into pGEX-2T. Both plasmids were used to transform E. coli BL21 cells. Cultures of E. coli BL21 transformants were grown at 30 °C in 2× TY medium with 100 μg/ml ampicillin toA 600 of 1.0 and then induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside and grown for an additional 2 h. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed by sonication using an ultrasonic processor XL apparatus (Misonix Inc.). When formation of inclusion bodies occurred, the inclusion bodies were isolated by low speed centrifugation (3000 × g; Sorvall GSA rotor, 5 min), the precipitate was washed twice with PBS, and the inclusion bodies precipitate was dissolved in 10% SDS. Digestion of the resulting glutathione S-transferase (from Schistosoma japonicum) fusion proteins was accomplished with thrombin (500 units/mg of protein, at room temperature for 4 h), and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Peptides A and B were eluted from polyacrylamide gels and used to raise antibodies as follows: 100 μg of peptide in 500 μl of PBS was emulsified with 500 μl of Freund′s adjuvant (Difco Laboratories Inc.), and the emulsion was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits by intradermal injection. This process was repeated three times, every 2 weeks, using incomplete Freund′s adjuvant. After immunization was complete, blood serum was collected by centrifugation and the IgG fraction was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, Sephadex G-25 desalting, and fast-protein liquid chromatography using a protein A-Sepharose HR 10/2 column as previously described (27Velasco J. Gutiérrez S. Campoy S. Martı́n J.F. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 379-385Google Scholar). The Affi-Gel Hz (Bio-Rad Laboratories) system was used for the preparation of an immunoaffinity column. Binding of the anti-α-AAR antibodies to the matrix was performed according to the supplier's instructions. Purified IgG (12.6 mg) was used to react with 5 ml of the matrix yielding 45% efficiency in the binding reaction. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C. P. chrysogenum mycelium (40 g of wet weight) was washed and ground in liquid nitrogen. The disrupted mycelium was resuspended in buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol) and ultracentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was then used as the source of enzyme. The mycelium extract (2085 mg of protein and 5525 units of enzyme) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (3.4 × 11 cm, 100 ml) equilibrated with buffer A (flow rate, 1.2 ml/min). The column was washed with 200 ml of this buffer before elution with a 600 ml of linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in buffer A. Fractions (6 ml) were collected, and those enriched in α-AAR were combined (60 ml) and designated as the DEAE-Sepharose α-AAR pool (96.5 mg of protein, 5418 units). The DEAE-Sepharose pool was concentrated to 4 ml in Centriprep YM-50 concentrators (Millipore), diluted 20-fold in buffer A containing 75 mmNaCl, and again concentrated to 4 ml. This preparation was then applied (flow rate, 1.4 ml/min) to a Sephacryl S-300 column (2.6 × 90 cm; 478 ml) equilibrated with buffer A containing 75 mmNaCl. Fractions (7 ml) were collected and assessed for the presence of α-AAR by SDS-PAGE and immunodetection. The Sephacryl S-300 pool (22 ml, 23 mg of protein, 1620 units) was diluted 3-fold in buffer A containing 1.5 m(NH4)2SO4 (to achieve a final concentration of 1 m(NH4)2SO4 and applied (flow rate 1.1 ml/min) to a phenyl-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow column (1.5 × 6.4 cm; 11 ml) previously equilibrated with the buffer A containing 1m (NH4)2SO4. Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 1 to 0 m(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A, and subsequently the enzyme was eluted with H2O. The final volume of the pooled active fractions was 50 ml (2 mg of protein, 339 units). The phenyl-Sepharose pool was dissolved in buffer A and applied (flow rate 0.3 ml/min) to an immunoaffinity column (5 ml; 5.67 mg of IgG anti-α-AAR) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 5 volumes of this buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and with 5 volumes of buffer A before elution with a solution of 100 mmglycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.5. Immediately after elution, 100 μl of 1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, was added to each fraction (1 ml) containing the enzyme to avoid protein denaturation. The enzyme solution was concentrated in a Centriprep YM-50 concentrator, dialyzed against buffer A containing 50% (v/v) glycerol, and preserved at −20 °C. Purified α-AAR was incubated withl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin at an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1/20 (w/w) or with elastase at an elastase/substrate ratio of 1/10 (w/w) in distilled water. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for various times and terminated by heating at 100 °C for 5 min in electrophoresis sample buffer (unless otherwise indicated). The reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE, and after electrophoresis, gels were stained either with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or transferred to ProBlott membranes for N-terminal sequencing. Labeling was performed at 30 °C, before or after limited proteolysis, using dl-α-[3H]aminoadipic acid in the absence of NADPH. Reactions (25 μl) contained 250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 21 mm MgCl2, 32 mm ATP, 2.2 mm reduced glutathione, 11.4 μm dl-α-[3H]AA, and 1.6 μg α-AAR. The preparations were incubated for 10 min, terminated by rapid freezing on dry ice/acetone, and stored at −80 °C. The trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay was performed with 10% trichloroacetic acid in the presence of 200 μg of bovine serum albumin. Precipitated proteins were washed twice with 5% trichloroacetic acid and resuspended in 100 μl of 1 mTris base, and the amount of incorporateddl-α-[3H]AA was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. For fluorography, gels were soaked for 30 min in 1 m sodium salicylate (pH 6.0) solution and dried before exposure to Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Biosciences); otherwise the radioimmunoassay for determination of peptide acylation involved gel slicing, protein extraction with 30% H2O2 (3 h at 60 °C), and 3H-label quantification by liquid scintillation counting. Protein concentrations were estimated using the Bradford method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-252Google Scholar) or by measuring the absorbance of column eluates at 280 nm. SDS-PAGE was performed in 7, 10, or 12% polyacrylamide gels by standard procedures. After electrophoresis, gels were stained either with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or with silver. Alternatively gels were transferred to ProBlott polyvinylidene difluoride membranes according to Matsudaira (29Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Google Scholar) and subjected to Edman degradation on an Applied Biosystems 477A pulsed-liquid protein sequencer. The α-AAR molecular mass was determined by microfast protein liquid chromatography using a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Superose 6 or Superose 12 column previously equilibrated with buffer A containing 75 mm NaCl. Chromatography was performed at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 4 °C. Superose 6 and Superose 12 columns were calibrated for molecular mass determination using the following proteins: thyroglobulin, ferritin, catalase, aldolase, and bovine serum albumin. The enzyme was purified from mycelium grown for 24 h (early phase of growth) in DPM medium. A summary of the specific activity and recovery of the enzyme during the purification procedure is given in Table I. Each purification step was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (Fig. 1). The purified enzyme showed a homogenous protein band on SDS-PAGE. The enzyme was purified 117-fold with a yield of 5.5% from the cell extract. The purified enzyme rapidly lost activity, even in 50% (v/v) glycerol at −20 °C, probably due to denaturation and degradation of this large protein as deduced by immunoblot analysis of old preparations (not shown). The N-terminal sequence of the α-AAR protein obtained from the immunoaffinity column was Met-Ala-Val-Gly-Thr-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gln-Asp, which fully agrees with the sequence deduced from the lys2gene starting at the first ATG codon of the open reading frame (15Casqueiro J. Gutiérrez S. Bañuelos O. Fierro F. Velasco J. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1998; 259: 549-556Google Scholar).Table IPurification of P. chrysogenum α-AARPoolProteinα-AAR activitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg of protein%-foldExtract208555252.61001DEAE-Sepharose96.55418.556.29821.2Sephacryl S-30023161970.429.327Phenyl-Sepharose2339169.56.165Immunoaffinity13053055.5117 Open table in a new tab The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be ∼155 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1), which is in close agreement with the predicted value deduced from the sequence (154.8 kDa). Molecular mass determination of the enzyme on Superose 6 under non-denaturing conditions yielded a mass of 171 ± 11 kDa, whereas analysis on Superose 12 resulted in a value of 169 ± 10 kDa. Taken together, these results suggest that the native enzyme has a monomeric nature. In a standard 60-min reaction the optimal temperature was found to be in the range of 25–29 °C. Above 30 °C the enzyme activity was rapidly lost. Within this temperature range, the period of linear phase of reaction lasted for 30 min, and the enzyme remained active for at least 2 h. The α-AAR stability was assessed by measuring activity after a previous treatment (5–60 min) at −20 °C, 4 °C, 30 °C, or 37 °C. Whereas at −20 °C or 4 °C the enzyme remained stable during the whole treatment, and at 30 °C there was a 20% loss in activity after 1 h of incubation. This activity loss was particularly evident at 37 °C where only 50% activity remained after 15 min of incubation. The pH dependence of enzyme activity on α-AA was measured in 100 or 250 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5–7.5, 100 or 250 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0–9.0, and 100 or 250 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.5–11.0, buffers. The enzyme activity was favored by using buffers with the higher ionic strength and became apparent throughout the pH range 7.5–9.5 with a peak at pH 9.0 (not shown). The analysis of the effect of divalent cations on activity showed that Mg2+ is absolutely required for activity; the optimal concentration was 10 mm. Mn2+ could replace Mg2+ to some extent (optimal concentration 5 mm), yielding 60% of the maximum activity attained with Mg2+. The ions Ca2+, Co2+, Hg2+, and Cu2+ could not substitute for Mg2+. The addition of chelating agents such as EDTA (5 mm) to the reaction mixture produced a 75% inhibition of the activity, further supporting the requirement of Mg2+for the reaction. The formation of α-AA-δ-semialdehyde by reduction of α-AA was monitored spectrophotometrically by measurement of the cyclized form of α-AA-δ-semialdehyde, Δ1-piperidine carboxylate, which reacts withp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde giving a yellow complex (λmax = 460 nm). Using this assay, theK m of P. chrysogenum Lys2 for its substrate α-AA was determined to be 1.4 ± 0.1 mm, and the k cat was 66 ± 5 min−1. In a similar way, the K m for ATP was 1.3 ± 0.0 mm, whereas for NADPH it was 160 ± 5 μm. Several analogs of the Lys2 substrate, α-AA, were assayed in the reaction mixture at the same concentration, including adipic acid,dl-diaminopimelic acid, l-glutamate, andS-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine. OnlyS-carboxymethyl-l-cysteine could be accepted as substrate by P. chrysogenum α-AAR, which yielded, however, 20-fold lower activity than with its natural substrate. Lys2 was digested with either trypsin or elastase at various molar ratios at 30 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures” for various lengths of time, and the resulting fragmentation pattern is shown in Fig.2. Fragment patterns were unaltered when SDS-PAGE was performed in the presence of dithiothreitol or 2-mercaptoethanol. Limited proteolysis was also attempted using chymotrypsin, but no stable fragments were observed. The fragmentation pattern generated by tryptic or elastase cleavage was similar. Fig. 2 shows the fragment pattern generated by trypsin. The initial cleavage introduced by trypsin resulted in the release of a 116-kDa fragment (T1) and a 28-kDa fragment (T2) as the first stable products (see Fig. 2 B). The size on SDS-PAGE and the N-terminal sequence of T1 showed that it comprises the adenylation domain, the PCP, and the NADPH binding site (19Hijarrubia M.J. Aparicio J.F. Martı́n J.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2001; 264: 755-762Google Scholar). Similarly, the N-terminal sequence of T2 indicated that this fragment includes most of the reduction domain, excluding the nucleotide binding site. As the hydrolysis continued, the C-terminal piece of T1 was removed leading to the generation of a 105-kDa fragment (T3) containing the adenylation and PCP domains. Subsequently, this fragment losses its N-terminal end resulting in a 76-kDa protein fragment (T4). As the time of incubation was increased, further fragments were generated concurrent with the disappearance of T3 fragment. Fragments T5 (30 kDa) and T6 (64 kDa) have the same N terminus as T3, and both have lost the PCP domain. Finally, other fragments generated were T7 (32 kDa), T8 (30 kDa), and T9 (29 kDa), which contain the C-terminal end of the adenylation domain (Fig. 2 B). T8 also contains the whole PCP domain (see below). Under harsher conditions, the fragments become unstructured and get degraded. As summarized in Fig. 2, the primary cleavage site is located at the N-terminal portion of the reductive domain (N-terminal end of fragment T2 (Ile1141)), dividing the molecule into two independent parts, namely the di-domain comprising the adenylating and PCP domains, including the NADPH-binding region located C-terminal of the PCP, and a fragment containing most of the reductive domain excluding the NADPH-binding site. A trichloroacetic acid-mediated protein precipitation assay was used to assess the dl-α-[3H]AA time-course acylation of P. chrysogenum α-AAR in the absence of NADPH (Fig. 3). Under such conditions the aminoacyl adenylate cannot be reduced and remains bound to the enzyme (5Ehmann D.E. Gehring A.M. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6171-6177Google Scholar). NADPH addition after 10 min of incubation released most of the radioactivity, indicating that in the presence of NADPH the full reaction is resumed, which is consistent with the reductive cleavage of the α-AA-S-PCP acyl enzyme to form the α-AA-δ-semialdehyde. When the α-AAR protein was labeled in the absence of NADPH and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and fluorography, the α-[3H]AA radioactivity was found associated with the Lys2 polypeptide (Fig.4 B, lane 1). To determine which domains were being acylated, various proteolytic digests of α-AAR were labeled as indicated above. Alternatively, the protein was first labeled and subsequently proteolyzed. In both cases, the pattern of labeled bands was identical (Fig. 4), finding radioactivity bound to fragments T1, T3, T4, and T6 but not to other small fragments. This indicates that any fragment containing the adenylation box (Fig. 2 A) (30Conti E. Stachelhaus T. Marahiel M.A. Brick P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4174-4183Google Scholar) can be labeled. The labeling observed in T6 is significant, because this fragment lacks the PCP domain. This labeling was always weaker than that obtained in other fragments (see below), indicating that the PCP domain might play a role in the stability of the acyl intermediate. These results were corroborated by liquid scintillation counting of peptide-bound radioactivity in slices of the polyacrylamide gel (see “Experimental Procedures”). Again, no significant difference was found between labeling before or after proteolysis, indicating that the adenylation domain functions as an independent entity and that there is no need for collaboration with other domains to load its substrate. Interestingly, some level of acylation could be detected in the PCP-containing fragment (T8) by using the gel slice method regardless of whether labeling was made before or after proteolysis. No labeled T8 protein band could be detected in the fluorography assay possibly due to low sensitivity of fluorography for tritiated compounds. Binding of the α-AA to the α-AAR following its activation as the α-aminoadipyladenylate has been proposed to occur through a thioester bond with the SH group of the phosphopantetheine arm (Fig. 5), although the formation of a direct ester group with a serine or threonine hydroxyl group of the enzyme can not be excluded. The nature of the bond formed can be differentiated by the selective hydrolysis of ester bonds with formic acid, whereas formic acid treatment does not cleave thioester bonds that require a treatment with performic acid (31Gevers W. Kleinkauf H. Lipmann F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1969; 63: 1335-1342Google Scholar). Treatment of the acylated enzyme (in the absence of NADPH) with formic did not release α-AA, whereas a clear release of α-[3H]AA, as observed by thin layer chromatography of the cleavage reaction product after protein precipitation, was obtained by treatment with performic acid (not shown). Very similar results were obtained after treatment with formic or performic acid of a mixture of the labeled fragments obtained after limited tryptic digestion. These results clearly indicate that the α-AA molecule in the absence of NADPH remains bound as a thioester to the phosphopantetheine ar"
https://openalex.org/W2084550631,"We have previously reported dissociation constants for a range of bisphosphonate analogs of 1,3-bisphospho-d-glyceric acid binding to yeast phosphoglycerate kinase. Data for the unsymmetrical analogs were difficult to interpret because it was not clear in which of the two possible orientations these ligands bound. Here we report a novel NMR method for quantifying orientation preference based on relaxation effects induced by titration with CrADP, which is applied to these ligands. It is shown that all ligands can bind in both orientations but that the driving force for the orientational preference is to put the α,α-difluoromethanephosphonate group in the “basic patch” (nontransferable phosphate) position. The relevance to the design of phosphoglycerate kinase inhibitors is discussed. We have previously reported dissociation constants for a range of bisphosphonate analogs of 1,3-bisphospho-d-glyceric acid binding to yeast phosphoglycerate kinase.

The relevance to the design of phosphoglycerate kinase inhibitors is discussed. yeast phosphoglycerate kinase 3-BPG, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate 3-phosphoglyceric acid β,γ-difluoromethyleneadenosine 5′-triphosphate magnesium complex of ATP Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK)1 (EC 2.7.2.3) is a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the following reaction, where MgADP and MgATP represent the magnesium complexes of ADP and ATP, respectively.1,3­Bisphosphoglycerate4−+MgADP−→3­phosphoglycerate3−+MgATP2−REACTION1It is an attractive drug design target because trypanosomes rely on glycolysis as their sole source of energy, and hence inhibition of PGK could provide effective treatment for trypanosomal infections. The enzymes from a wide variety of sources have been compared (1João H.C. Williams R.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 1-18Google Scholar, 2Banks R.D. Blake C.C.F. Evans P.R. Haser R. Rice D.W. Hardy G.W. Merrett M. Phillips A.W. Nature. 1979; 279: 773-777Google Scholar). They show high sequence and structure similarity and consist of monomeric proteins of 45 kDa with two distinct domains connected by a hinge (Fig.1). The N-terminal domain (which also contains the last 10 residues at the C terminus) has a “basic patch” containing a number of arginines and histidines that is the binding site for the glycolytic substrates 1,3-BPG and 3-PGA. The C-terminal domain is the binding site for ATP/ADP. The enzyme has a number of crystal structures (2–13). In many the two domains are in an open conformation with the substrates ∼11 Å apart, which is much too far for direct phosphotransfer. Crystal structures also exist in which the enzyme forms a closed conformation with the two substrates close enough for direct nucleophilic associative phosphotransfer (14Knowles J.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 877-919Google Scholar). A mechanism has been proposed based on these crystal structures of which the key features are that Arg-38 binds to the transferred 1-phosphate of 1,3-BPG and locates it close to the nucleophilic oxygen of ADP in the closed form, whereas Lys-213 (Lys-197 in Thermotoga maritima) (9Auerbach G. Huber R. Grättinger M. Zaiss K. Schurig H. Jaenicke R. Jacob U. Structure. 1997; 5: 1475-1483Google Scholar, 10Bernstein B.E. Michels P.A.M. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 275-278Google Scholar) also binds to the phosphate, stabilizing the negative charge that develops on it as it transfers, thereby catalyzing the phosphoryl transfer. (Note: yeast PGK numbering has been used throughout.) The hinge bending has been studied in detail. Another subject of intense study is the kinetics of the reaction, which is activated by anions (15Scopes R.K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 91: 119-129Google Scholar). Although the issue has not been resolved, it is likely that an anion binding site is formed when the two domains close (16Szilágyi A.N. Vas M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8551-8563Google Scholar). The crystal structures have provided considerable information on how the substrates bind, both to the closed and to the open conformations. 1,3-BPG itself is very unstable, so no structures exist of bound 1,3-BPG. Crystals of 3-PGA show it bound with the 3-phosphate close to Arg-168, Arg-121, and Arg-65 in the basic patch, with the carboxylate close to Arg-38 and pointing toward the nucleotide. Somewhat surprisingly, in crystals of Trypanosoma brucei PGK grown in the presence of 3-PGA and MgADP from 2.5 mpotassium phosphate, two of the four subunits in the asymmetric unit have a phosphate anion bound in the basic patch but close to Arg-38,i.e. close to the transferable phosphate site (11Bernstein B.E. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4429-4436Google Scholar, 12Bernstein B.E. Williams D.M. Bressi J.C. Kuhn P. Gelb M.H. Blackburn G.M. Hol W.G.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 1137-1148Google Scholar). We have previously reported the synthesis and dissociation constants of PGK ligands based on 1,3-BPG (17Blackburn G.M. Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994; 4: 2573-2578Google Scholar, 18Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4439-4452Google Scholar), which inhibit PGK (19McHarg J. Littlechild J.A. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1996; 48: 201-205Google Scholar). The phosphate linkages were replaced by non-scissile methanephosphonates, giving ligands that bind as much as 50 times more tightly than 3-PGA. It was observed that replacement of methanephosphonate by α,α-difluoromethanephosphonate increased the affinity, and it was suggested that this was because of the lower pK ainduced by the fluorines (18Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4439-4452Google Scholar, 20Caplan N.A. Pogson C.I. Hayes D.J. Blackburn G.M. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 2000; I: 421-437Google Scholar). However, replacement ofboth methanephosphonates by difluoromethanephosphonates led to no further increase in affinity, suggesting that only one end of the molecule required the lower pK a and consequent greater charge density at neutral pH. Affinities could not be interpreted further because it was not possible to tell in which orientation the unsymmetrical ligands were binding. We have therefore developed a method to distinguish the orientation of the ligands and report its application with an analysis of the implications for design of PGK ligands. Yeast PGK was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals as an ammonium sulfate suspension, resuspended in 0.1 m Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5% ammonium sulfate, then concentrated into 40 mm KCl, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.1 ± 0.05, in D2O. The protein concentration was typically 0.3 mm. PGK ligands were synthesized as described previously (18Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4439-4452Google Scholar). CrADP was prepared as described (21Dunaway-Mariano D. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1496-1505Google Scholar). One-dimensional 31P NMR spectra were acquired at 300 K on a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer at 203.462 MHz using 60,000 scans over a spectral width of 8196 Hz and 2048 complex data points. A pulse angle of 60 ° (6.5 μs) was used with a relaxation delay of 0.5 s between pulses. Simultaneous decoupling of 1H and19F was achieved during signal acquisition using a directional coupler. The probe was tuned to 19F, and optimal decoupling without disturbance of the signal was achieved using1H decoupling (26 db attenuation of normal pulse power or ∼330 Hz decoupling field at the sample) applied directly through the directional coupler and 19F decoupling (10 db attenuation or ∼500-Hz field) into the side of the directional coupler. Both channels used Waltz-16 composite pulse decoupling. It proved particularly important to decouple the 31P signals efficiently from both 1H and 19F. In spectra where 19F was not decoupled, addition of CrADP gave rise to differential broadening of the 19F-coupled triplet with the outer lines broadening much more rapidly than the central line (22Bendel P. James T.L. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 76-85Google Scholar). This effect is caused by different relaxation rates of different elements of the scalar-coupled density matrix (23Vold R.R. Vold R.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1976; 64: 320-332Google Scholar), possibly exacerbated by cross-correlation effects (24Werbelow L.G. Grant D.M. Adv. Magn. Reson. 1977; 9: 189-299Google Scholar). Although these effects are of interest from a theoretical perspective, they make analysis of the relaxation data much more complicated. Indeed, simple analysis of the width of the central line gave results completely different from those obtained using complete decoupling. The free induction decays were zero filled to 4096 complex points, and then sensitivity enhanced by mild exponential multiplication of 2–3 Hz. A control spectrum was recorded with 1 molar eq of 1,3-BPG analog to PGK and no CrADP. Subsequent spectra were recorded after the addition of 12 mm CrADP. Three or four points were obtained for each analog with up to 1.5 eq of CrADP. The spectra were analyzed using Felix (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA) to measure the line width of the31P signals by fitting to Lorentzian lines. The fitting was typically truncated at 10% of peak height. Errors were estimated by repeated fitting using different processing, base-line correction, and starting values for the fit. Simulations showed that the mild linebroadening applied had no significant effect on the line width ratios. The magnetic moment of an unpaired electron is ≈103times greater than that of a nucleus. Fluctuation of local magnetic fields leads to relaxation, and the larger magnetic fields resulting from the presence of a paramagnetic species give rise to particularly efficient nuclear spin relaxation. The strong local magnetic field produced by an unpaired electron can be coupled to nuclei by dipole-dipole interactions. The dipolar effect of the unpaired electron on surrounding nuclei is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between electron and nucleus, implying that the distance from a nucleus to an unpaired electron can be measured by its effect on nuclear transverse relaxation times (T 2), which are proportional to line widths. In the experiments described here we measure the effect of Cr3+ on the relaxation of the two31P nuclei in the ligand, here denoted α and β, and use the relative broadening to measure the distance to each nucleus and hence the orientation of the ligand. Chromium(III) is a high spin (3d 3 ion) dipolar relaxation probe. The contribution to the nuclear transverse relaxation rate (1/T 2,p) from the paramagnetic probe is given by equations derived by Solomon and Bloembergen and presented by Mildvan and Gupta (Ref. 25Mildvan A.S. Gupta R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 322-359Google Scholar and references therein) as Equation 1.1T2,p=fqF(τc)Cr6Equation 1 fq is the mole fraction of nuclei bound, Cis a constant dependent on nuclear and electronic magnetic moments,r is the distance from Cr3+ to the relaxing nucleus, and F(τc) is a function of τc (correlation time for dipolar relaxation) and ω (Larmor frequency of phosphorus). The line width at half-height (Δν1/2,obs) in the presence of the paramagnetic ion is inversely proportional to the observedT 2 (T 2,obs, Equation2).Δν1/2,obs=2πT2,obsEquation 2 Under conditions of fast exchange of the Cr3+ on and off the protein, the observed relaxation rate can be considered to arise from two contributions (Equation 3), namely, the relaxation rate in the absence of the paramagnetic ion 1/T 2,abs, and the relaxation rate arising from dipolar interaction with the bound paramagnetic ion, 1/T 2,p.1T2,obs=1T2,abs+1T2,pEquation 3 Combining Equations 1, 2, and 3 for a 31P nucleus α gives Equation 4 (τc is the assumed constant).Δν1/2,obs,α=Cα′[CrADP]1rα6+kEquation 4 k is a constant assuming all 1/T 2,abs values are the same for all observed cases. A plot of peak width at half-height versus [CrADP] has a gradient ofC′αr α−6. Thus, a ratio of gradients allows us to estimate the relative distances of the 31P nuclei α and β (r α/r β) in the basic patch from the paramagnetic probe CrADP in the nucleotide binding site. The ratio of gradients is calculated according to Equation 5,gradientαgradientβ=Cα′rα−6Cβ′rβ−6=rαrβ−6Equation 5 because C′α =C′ β. Thus, the 31P signal that broadens most on the addition of CrADP is the one closest to the Cr3+. If the enzyme remains in its open conformation when the ligands bind, then the ratio rα/rβis fixed and can be estimated from crystal structures (3Watson H.C. Walker N.P.C. Shaw P.J. Bryant T.N. Wendell P.L. Fothergill L.A. Perkins R.E. Conroy S.C. Dobson M.J. Tuite M.F. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1635Google Scholar) as 1.8. Any ratio of gradientα/gradientβ less extreme than 1/(rα/rβ)6= 1:34 can therefore be interpreted as caused by the ligand binding in both possible orientations. If the ligand binds in conformation I with probability p and in conformation II with probability 1 − p (Fig. 2), then the results are determined by Equations 6 and 7.1T2,p,I∝prα6+(1−p)rβ6Equation 6 1T2,p,II∝(1−p)rα6+prβ6Equation 7 Substituting Equations 6 and 7 into Equations 2 and 3, we obtain Equation 8.gradientαgradientβ=Cα′prα6+(1−p)rβ6Cβ′prβ6+(1−p)rα6=Cα′p34rβ6+(1−p)rβ6Cβ′prβ6+(1−p)34rβ6Equation 8 After rearrangement and using Equation 5, the apparent distance ratio is given by Equation 9, thereby allowing us to estimate conformational preference.rα/rβ=634p+(1−p)p+34(1−p)Equation 9 This function is shown in Fig. 3, which shows that relatively small proportions of binding in the alternative conformation drastically reduce the apparent distance ratio.Figure 3Plot of Equation 9.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) If the enzyme conformation is altered in the direction of the closed form when the ligands bind, then both rα andrβ are reduced and the ratiorα/rβ increases. The conformational preference derived above (Equation 9) is therefore a maximum limit, and any closed form population brings the conformational preference closer to 50%. 31P NMR spectra were acquired for a range of PGK ligands in 1:1 complexes with PGK, and line widths were measured as a function of added CrADP. The addition of CrADP caused a monotonic increase in line width as expected. From the 1H spectra acquired on titration of the ligands with PGK, it is clear that no large conformational changes occur in PGK, and thus the enzyme is expected to remain in the “open” conformation seen in the majority of crystal structures. Typical spectra are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for a ligand containing only methanephosphonates and a ligand containing both a methanephosphonate and an α,α-difluoromethanephosphonate, respectively. Differential broadening exists of the two 31P signals, which indicates a conformational preference of the ligand. Line widths were measured by line fitting, and the gradients of line width versus CrADP were compared to derive an effective distance ratio of the two phosphorus atoms from the chromium, as in Equation 5. A typical result is shown in Fig.6 for compound 6 (data from Fig. 5). The results are summarized in Table II, which also presents the affinities measured previously. None of the distance ratios measured approached the theoretical limit of 1.8 as presented above (assuming that the open enzyme conformation is the same as that in the crystal). The largest ratio found was 1.49. We therefore used the distance ratios to calculate the approximate conformational preference of the ligands, which are listed in Table II. Conformational preferences range between 29 and 94%, with some analogs showing almost no orientational preference. We note that nonspecific binding of the ligand to PGK would reduce the ratio toward a 50% orientational preference; therefore, the values given in Table II represent minimum values for the conformational preference.Figure 5CrADP titration of 6.

Open table in a new tab Table IStructures of analogs used in Cr3+ NMR experiments Open table in a new tab The ligands were designed to have a similar electronic distribution to 1,3-BPG and 3-PGA in having either a simple ketone or an amide group in analogous positions to the substrates (Table I). Therefore it was expected that the non-symmetrical ligands would bind such that the carbonyl oxygen would occupy a location similar to that of the carboxylate of 3-PGA. The results presented in Table II for the nonfluorinated analogs 1, 4, and 5show that they do indeed bind preferentially in the expected orientation but that the conformational preference is not strong. We have previously shown that substitution of the methanephosphonate by the α,α-difluoromethanephosphonate group almost always gave a large increase in affinity for PGK (18Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4439-4452Google Scholar). (One of the few exceptions is7, which is mainly in the diol form and therefore has steric problems in binding.) This was true whether the fluorines were placed at what was expected to be the 1-phosphate end (2) or the 3-phosphate end (3), yet substitution at both ends gave binding that was no stronger and indeed often weaker. The results (Table II) indicate that in all cases the difluoromethanephosphonate group is positioned at the 3-phosphate end. This finding makes sense of the affinities as discussed below. A quantitative use of paramagnetic relaxation as done here is only applicable if certain conditions are met. Many of the NMR-specific requirements have been addressed by Gupta and co-workers (25Mildvan A.S. Gupta R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 49: 322-359Google Scholar, 26Gupta R.K. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8878-8886Google Scholar), who showed in a study of pyruvate kinase that CrADP can be used as a substitution-inert paramagnetic analog of MgADP and that the relaxation effects are dominated by the paramagnetism of the chromium in a simple r− 6relationship. CrATP has been shown to be a suitable analog of MgATP when binding PGK, and its effects on longitudinal relaxation rates were used to probe substrate binding (27Gregory J.D. Serpersu E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3880-3888Google Scholar). It is also of course necessary that CrADP binds at a single site on PGK. In this case chromium is in a very similar position to magnesium (28Tanswell P. Westhead E.W. Williams R.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 249-262Google Scholar, 29Lester L.M. Rusch L.A. Robinson G.J. Speckhard D.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5349-5355Google Scholar). Considerable debate has occurred as to whether 1,3-BPG and its analogs bind at more than one site on PGK (16Szilágyi A.N. Vas M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8551-8563Google Scholar), and it is now reasonably clear that at least in the open form it only has a single major binding site (13Szilágyi A.N. Ghosh M. Garman E. Vas M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 499-511Google Scholar). Finally, by using a low concentration of both enzyme and CrADP along with tight binding PGK ligands we can ensure that essentially all of the paramagnetic relaxation of the ligand occurs while bound to the enzyme, and no significant relaxation occurs in a CrADP·ligand binary complex. This fact has been confirmed by measurements in the absence of enzyme (data not shown). Apparent 31P-chromium distance ratios were obtained from measuring the change in line width of the 31P signal with the addition of CrADP. In all cases the ratios were substantially smaller than the theoretical limit of 1.8. This result could in principle be explained if the geometry of the bound 1,3-BPG analogs relative to CrADP is very different from that of 1,3-BPG so that the31P-chromium distance ratios become more similar. This circumstance is unlikely. In PGK crystal structures (2–13) and in a modeling study (30Chandra N.R. Muihead H. Holbrook J.J. Bernstein B.E. Hol W.G.J. Sessions R.B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1998; 30: 372-380Google Scholar) the only significant change is a complete or partial closure of the hinge between the two domains that brings the transferable 1-phosphate closer to the bound nucleotide while maintaining the same orientation and therefore makes the ratior α/r β greater not smaller. The two most likely explanations for the reduced distance ratios are either that CrADP or the analogs bind weakly in different binding sites or that the 1,3-BPG analogs can bind in the correct binding site but with both possible orientations. The first option can be ruled out as discussed above. Thus, binding in two possible orientations is the most likely explanation for the lowr α/r β ratio. Equation 9 provides a crude but useful characterization of the approximate conformational preference of the 1,3-BPG analogs tested. The most striking result is that all of the α,α-difluoromethanephosphonate analogs bind with the more highly charged difluoromethanephosphonate at the 3-phosphate end. This finding is perhaps surprising in view of the location of the phosphate anion at the 1-phosphate end in the T. brucei crystal structure, but it allows us to interpret the ligand affinities in a straightforward manner. We assume that the greater charge density induced by the difluoro substitution is the main driving force for the conformational preference seen. It may also be the case, however, that the fluorines can act as mimics of the lone pairs of the phosphate-bridging oxygen of the substrate and participate in hydrogen bonds to the enzyme, as seen in a crystal structure of glycerol phosphate bound to AMP-PCF2P (31Bystrom C.E. Pettigrew D.W. Branchaud B.P. O'Brien P. Remington S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3508-3518Google Scholar). However, the result does agree with the long standing findings that the 3-phosphate groups should be doubly ionized to bind effectively (32Orr G.A. Knowles J.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 721-723Google Scholar) and that the binding of the carboxylate of 3-PGA is less important (33Vas M. Batke J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 139: 115-123Google Scholar). We note that the strongest conformational preference was for 3, which has the amide functionality in a “substrate-like” location. The results indicate that the location of the difluoromethanephosphonate dominates the orientation of binding and that any functionalization of the carbon chain between the phosphorus atoms has only a secondary effect. Thus, a difluoromethanephosphonate group at the 3-phosphate end is always favorable and will make the ligand bind in this orientation even if this means disrupting other substrate-like interactions elsewhere. The effect can be seen from a comparison of 2 and 3, both of which bind with the fluorines at the 3-phosphate end, despite putting the carbonyl group of 2 in the “incorrect” location. However, such “incorrectness” only reduces the affinity from 2 μm (3) to 6 μm(2). This conclusion makes sense of our previous study (18Jakeman D.L. Ivory A.J. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4439-4452Google Scholar), which showed that substitution by a single difluoromethanephosphonate always improved affinity but that substitution of difluoromethanephosphonates at both ends of the ligands conferred no additional affinity and often reduced the affinity. We infer that the presence of a difluoromethanephosphonate group at the transferred 1-phosphate position must be unfavorable either for steric reasons or because the greater charge density on the difluoromethanephosphonate cannot easily be stabilized in the open form of the enzyme. The enzyme functions by stabilizing the developing negative charge on the transferring phosphate in the closed form (11Bernstein B.E. Hol W.G.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4429-4436Google Scholar), and therefore we suggest that inhibitors should only have a charge of −1 at the 1-phosphate end but a charge of −2 at the 3-phosphate end. Our results suggest that the basic patch is important mainly as a region of high positive charge to locate the 3-phosphate of the substrate (34Williams D.M. Jakeman D.L. Vyle J.S. Williamson M.P. Blackburn G.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 2603-2608Google Scholar). This finding may explain why mutations in the basic patch have relatively little effect on the kinetics of the reaction (1João H.C. Williams R.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 1-18Google Scholar,35Sherman M.A. Fairbrother W.J. Mas M.T. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1-9Google Scholar). In summary, we have shown that the results obtained on the orientation of PGK ligands allow us to interpret the affinities measured previously. We suggest that an effective PGK inhibitor should have a high charge density at the non-transferred 3-phosphate end but a lower charge density at the transferred 1-phosphate end. Steric restrictions at the 3-phosphate end are not strong. We have not identified strong requirements for functionality within the ligand, although substrate-like functionality provides weak additional affinity."

Changes have been made in methionine 33, located in the hydrophobic patch of the copper protein, and in arginine 86 and proline 53, both located in the eastern hydrophilic area. The reactivity toward photosystem I of single mutants M33N, P53A, P53E, R86Q, R86E, and the double mutant M33N/P14L has been studied by laser flash absorption spectroscopy.

Mutations at position 53 also promote major changes in the association of plastocyanin with photosystem I, yielding a change from a mechanism involving complex formation to a simpler collisional interaction.

In eukaryotic Pc, two active sites have been identified: site 1, an hydrophobic flat region around the copper binding area, and site 2, a charged region referred to as the acidic patch in plants and eukaryotic algae because it includes aspartate and glutamate residues. Whereas site 1 is involved in vitro in hydrophobic interactions of Pc with both redox partners and in the electron transfer event itself, site 2 is responsible for the electrostatic interactions and molecular recognition with complementary positive areas both in PSI and cytochrome f (3Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Google Scholar). However, the relevance of such electrostatic interactions in vivo can be different, as is the case for the interaction between cytochromefand Pc (4Soriano G.M. Ponamarev M.V. Piskorowski R.A. Cramer W.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15120-15128Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, site 2 can be either negatively or positively charged (5De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Dı́az-Quintana A. De la Cerda B.

All these differences between distinct organisms have led to different reaction mechanisms for PSI reduction (5De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Dı́az-Quintana A. De la Cerda B. Molina-Heredia F.P.

Recently, an analysis of the interaction of Pc with PSI from the prochlorophyteProchlorothrix hollandica, both for WT and mutated Pc (10Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P.

De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar), revealed that Prochlorothrix Pc reacts with PSI by forming a transient complex with PSI that is stabilized by means of hydrophobic interactions. The solution structure ofProchlorothrix Pc has been solved by NMR spectroscopy (12Babu C.R. Volkman B.F. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4988-4995Google Scholar), showing that this Pc contains an altered hydrophobic patch due to the presence of three unique residues, Tyr-12, Pro-14, and Met-33 (corresponding to the conserved Gly-10, Leu-12, and Asn-31 as numbered in the spinach protein). Single (Y12G, Y12F, Y12W, and P14L) and double (Y12G/P14L) mutations in the hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix Pc do not alter the constant of complex formation with PSI, but the electron transfer rate constant is significantly affected (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). Most interesting changes are obtained with mutants at Pro-14: reversion of the “unique” Pro-14 of Prochlorothrix Pc to the “standard” leucine of all other Pcs enhances the reactivity of Pc toward PSI, thereby indicating that Prochlorothrix Pc interaction with PSI is not optimized (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). More recently, a computational simulation ofProchlorothrix Pc-PSI docking suggested that Tyr-12 in Pc participates in hydrogen bonding with an asparagine residue in the PsaB polypeptide of PSI. This model also shows a short α-helix in Pc around position Pro-53 interacting with a small β-sheet extension of the PsaA polypeptide in PSI (13Myshkin E. Leontis N.B. Bullerjahn G.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3305-3313Google Scholar). In this study, we have extended our previous studies ofProchlorothrix PSI reduction by Pc to analyze the reactivity of Prochlorothrix Pc mutants at Met-33, in the hydrophobic patch, as well as at Pro-53 and Arg-86, in the electrostatically charged area. An arginine residue in an equivalent position to Arg-86 in Prochlorothrix Pc seems to be a specific feature of prokaryotic Pc, and it has been shown that this residue plays a fundamental role in the interaction with PSI (5De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Dı́az-Quintana A. De la Cerda B. Molina-Heredia F.P. Balme A. Murdoch P.S. Dı́az-Moreno I. Durán R.V. Hervás M. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 55: 41-45Google Scholar, 14Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Google Scholar). The laser-flash absorption spectroscopy analyses herein reported indicate that replacing Met-33 by the standard asparagine (as is the case for the replacement of Pro-14 by leucine) as well as Pro-53 substitution make the copper protein react much more efficiently with PSI, whereas Arg-86 replacement only promotes moderate effects on (Pc-PSI) complex formation. Mutant and WTP. hollandica Pc were expressed as inclusion bodies inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI), as previously described (15Babu C.R. Arudchandran A. Hille R. Gross E.L. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 235: 631-635Google Scholar). Pc preparations were analyzed by absorption and far-UV circular dichroism spectroscopy as described in Babuet al. (15Babu C.R. Arudchandran A. Hille R. Gross E.L. Bullerjahn G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1997; 235: 631-635Google Scholar). Redox titration of Pc preparations was monitored by absorption spectroscopy at 602 nm in increasing ratios of ferrocyanide/ferricyanide as previously described (16Kolthoff I.M. Tomsicek R. J. Phys. Chem. 1935; 39: 945-954Google Scholar). Construction of mutant Pc in our expression system employed the Stratagene QuikChange kit, and custom mutagenic primers were obtained from Invitrogen. The primer sequences directing the following mutations were obtained: for M33N, 5′-CCGTTGAGTTCGTGAACAACAAGGTTGGTCCC-3′; R86Q, 5′-CGCCCCACCAGGGCGCTGGCATGGTCGGC-3′; R86E, 5′-CGCCCCACGAAGGCGCTGGCATGGTCGGC-3′; P53A, 5′-GCCGGTGAGAGCGCCGCCGCTCTGTCCAACACC-3′; P53E, 5′-GCCGGTGAGAGCGCCGAAGCTCTGTCCAACACC-3′. Double mutant M33N/P14L employed the P14L mutant expression plasmid as a template for the M33N primer (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol.

The P700 content in PSI samples was calculated from the photoinduced absorbance changes at 820 nm using the absorption coefficient of 6.5 mm−1 cm−1 determined by Mathis and Sétif (18Mathis P. Sétif P. Isr. J. Chem. 1981; 21: 316-320Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined according to Arnon (19Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Google Scholar). The chlorophyll/P700 ratio of the resulting preparation was 150/1. Spinach, Synechocystis, andAnabaena PSI were purified as previously described (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Google Scholar). Kinetics of flash-induced absorbance changes in PSI were followed at 820 nm as described in Hervás et al. (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Google Scholar), except that the setup was optimized by replacing the measuring light by an attenuated laser diode (830 nm, 150 mW, model LD 1361 from Laser 2000 Ltd.). Unless otherwise stated, the standard reaction mixture contained, in a final volume of 0.2 ml, 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.03% β-dodecyl maltoside, 10 mmMgCl2, an amount of PSI-enriched particles equivalent to 0.35 mg of chlorophyll ml−1, 0.1 mm methyl viologen, 2 mm sodium ascorbate and Pc at the indicated concentration. All the experiments were performed at 22 °C in a 1-mm path-length cuvette. Each kinetic trace was the average of 5–10 independent measurements with 30 s spacing between flashes. For most experiments, the estimated error in the observed rate constants (k obs) was less than 10%, based on reproducibility and signal-to-noise ratios. Data collection and analysis were as previously described (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Google Scholar, 20Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G.

Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Google Scholar) and saved as a (Protein Data Bank) file. Only those rotamers lacking steric clashes with other amino acids were selected. Charges of most atoms were taken from the AMBER 6.0 force field (22Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.V. Cheng A.L. Vincent J.J. Crowley M. Ferguson D.M. Radmer R.J. Seibel G.L. Singh U.C. Weiner P.K. Kollman P.A. AMBER6. University of California, San Francisco2000Google Scholar). Charges and other force field parameters for the copper atom and its ligands were obtained from NMR structural data and compared with similar Pc simulations in the literature (23Ullmann G.M. Knapp E.-W. Kostic N.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 42-52Google Scholar, 24Ungar L.W. Scherer N.F. Voth G.A. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 5-17Google Scholar). To preserve the geometry of the copper site, the bonds between the copper atom and its ligands were treated as covalent (25Arcangeli C. Bizzarri A.R. Cannistraro S. Biophys. Chem. 2001; 92: 183-199Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files for both mutants were generated using the xLeap module of the AMBER 6.0 package. Hydration was treated explicitly by including the protein in a 10-Å water box according to the TIP3P model (26Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Google Scholar). Proteins were subjected to 1000 steps of steepest descent energy minimization to relax large steric overlaps or electrostatic inconsistencies. Next, the system was equilibrated for 30 ps with 500 kcal/mol constraints applied on the protein structure. The temperature was gradually increased from 100 K to 300 K. During the equilibration phase the potential, kinetic, and total energies were monitored. The water box reached density 1.00 after 4 ps. After equilibration, the system was minimized during 1000 steps of the steepest descent algorithm. Next, the molecular dynamics was run for 1000 ps at 300 K, during which the data were collected every 1000 fs. No constraints were applied on the Pc secondary structure to allow for the better exploration of conformational space. Non-bonded van der Waals interactions were cut off beyond 9 Å. The long-range electrostatics were treated with the Particle Mesh Ewald method (27Darden T.A. York D.M. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Google Scholar). The SHAKE option (28Ryckaert J.P. Ciccotti G. Berendsen H.J.C. J. Comput. Phys. 1977; 23: 327-341Google Scholar) was used to constrain all bonds, which enables a 2-fs time step. The 950 ps of data were used for analysis by the CARNAL block of AMBER. Hydrogen bonding was defined by geometric criteria: the cut-off distance between hydrogen and acceptor was 3.5 Å (for sulfur, 4 Å) and the deviation of donor-acceptor distance from linearity was less than 60o (29Kollman P.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R501Google Scholar). All H-bonds with occupancy greater than 25% were considered as maintained during the simulation. The variant residue Met-33 at the hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix Pc (Fig. 1) was chosen to be mutated to the standard asparagine in other Pcs in order to study its role in the reactivity of Pc toward PSI, because it has been previously reported that replacement in this area of the also atypical Pro-14 by the standard leucine drastically enhancesProchlorothrix Pc electron transfer to PSI (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). A double mutant with reversion of both methionine and proline to the standard residues asparagine and leucine, respectively, was also constructed (Fig. 1). Proline at position 53, located in a loop proposed to interact with PSI (13Myshkin E. Leontis N.B. Bullerjahn G.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3305-3313Google Scholar), was replaced by either alanine or glutamic acid. Additionally, arginine at position 86 was replaced both by glutamine and glutamate (Fig. 1), because an equivalent arginine has been shown to be crucial in the donor-PSI interaction in other cyanobacteria (5De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Dı́az-Quintana A. De la Cerda B. Molina-Heredia F.P. Balme A. Murdoch P.S. Dı́az-Moreno I. Durán R.V. Hervás M. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 55: 41-45Google Scholar). Most of the mutations do not significantly alter the midpoint redox potential of the copper protein (ΔE m ≤ 20 mV; Table I), with the exception of the R86E mutant, whose redox potential is about 30 mV lower than WT. In general, changes in redox potential should slightly increase the driving force for electron transfer to PSI, except in the case of the M33N mutant, whose redox potential is about 20 mV higher than WT (Table I). All mutant oxidized Pc yield an absorption peak at 602 nm, identical to that of WT.Table IMidpoint redox potentials (Em) of wild-type and mutant plastocyanins and association rate constants (KA) and electron transfer rate constants (ket) for Prochlorothrix photosystem I reduction by the different mutantsProteinEmK AK A (+0.1 mNaCl)k etk et (+0.1m NaCl)mVm−1m−1s −1s −1WT3701.4 × 1041.6 × 1041,3901,450P14LaValues from Ref. 11.3550.9 × 1040.6 × 1043,9004,050M33N3881.5 × 1041.2 × 1046,7005,000M33N/P14L3561.2 × 1040.7 × 1046,9006,200R86Q3590.9 × 1040.6 × 1042,6502,190R86E3440.2 × 1040.1 × 1043,3104,700P53A3723.5 × 107 bThese values correspond to bimolecular rate constants (m−1 s−1).2.4 × 107 bThese values correspond to bimolecular rate constants (m−1 s−1).P53E3553.4 × 107 bThese values correspond to bimolecular rate constants (m−1 s−1).2.7 × 107 bThese values correspond to bimolecular rate constants (m−1 s−1).a Values from Ref. 11Navarro J.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar), the laser-flash-induced kinetic traces of PSI reduction by all the mutated Pcs are monoexponential (Fig. 2). However, the efficiency of the electron transfer process changes from one protein to another. Thus, as shown in Fig. 2 for some mutants, kinetic traces for PSI reduction by the P53A and M33N mutants are significantly faster as compared with WT Pc, whereas the R83E mutant shows slightly slower kinetics (Fig. 2). The dependence of the observed pseudo first-order rate constant (k obs) upon donor protein concentration shows a saturation profile for all mutants at positions 33 and 86 but not for those at position 53, which present linear concentration dependences (Fig. 3). These findings suggest the formation of a bimolecular (Pc-PSI) transient complex prior to electron transfer for mutants at positions 33 and 86, as previously described for the WT system as well as for other mutants of Prochlorothrix Pc (10Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). However, the behavior of the proteins mutated at position 53 can be better described by assuming just a second-order collisional process, with no formation of any detectable electron transfer complex (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Google Scholar).Figure 3Dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) for Prochlorothrixphotosystem I reduction by wild type and mutated plastocyanins upon donor protein concentration. Lines correspond to the theoretical fits as described under “Results.” Other conditions were as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) From the saturation profiles in Fig. 3, and applying the formalism developed in Meyer et al. (20Meyer T.E. Zhao Z.G. Cusanovich M.A. Tollin G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4552-4559Google Scholar), it is possible to estimate both K A (the equilibrium constant for complex formation) and k et (the intracomplex electron transfer first-order rate constant). The bimolecular second-order rate constant (k 2) for the interaction between P53A and P53E Pc and PSI can be directly calculated from linear dependences shown in Fig. 3. Table I shows the values for all these constants, as well as the previously reported values for the P14L mutant for comparative purposes (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). There are no significant changes inK A for the mutants M33N and M33N/P14L as compared with WT Pc. Replacing Arg-86 by glutamine promotes a moderate decrease (to 60%) in K A, whereas the most drastic decrease is observed for the R86E mutant (to 15%), in which a negative charge is introduced. Concerning the electron transfer step, Table I shows that all the mutations significantly enhance the efficiency of Pc in donating electrons to PSI, with the most relevant increases being obtained for both mutants in Met-33, in which ∼5 × increases in k et are observed (Table I). Although it is not possible to estimate a k etvalue for P53A and P53E mutants, the k obs values shown in Fig. 3 at high Pc concentration (up to 8,500 s−1) are much higher than any k et value from TableI. To check whether the hydrophobic nature of the interaction between Pc and PSI in Prochlorothrix is altered by mutations, the kinetics of PSI reduction were also followed at high ionic strength. As can be seen in Table I, none of the mutants shows significant changes in K A, k et, ork 2 upon increasing salt concentration, as previously described for the WT and other mutated Pcs (10Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III.

Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). It has been previously reported that Prochlorothrix WT Pc exhibits a very low reactivity in cross reactions with PSI from either spinach or the cyanobacteria Anabaena andSynechocystis (10Navarro J.A. Hervás M. Babu C.R. Molina-Heredia F.P. Bullerjahn G.S. De la Rosa M.A. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. III. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1605-1608Google Scholar). However, the P14L mutant, designed to revert the “exclusive” proline in the hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix to the standard leucine, showed a general enhanced reactivity toward PSI from different sources (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). Here we have also checked the reactivity of mutants toward heterospecific PSI (Table II). In all cases, linear dependences were observed when plotting k obs versus protein concentration (not shown), thus allowing the estimation of k 2 for the different Pc/PSI systems (Table II). None of the mutants show reactivity with spinach PSI, as deduced by the low k 2 values shown in Table II for this photosystem, and k 2 values for spinach Pc could not be calculated because this Pc follows a three-step reaction mechanism with its PSI (6Hervás M. Navarro J.A. Dı́az A. Bottin H. De la Rosa M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11321-11326Google Scholar). When studying cyanobacterial PSI, replacement of Met-33 by the standard asparagine, either in the single mutant or in the M33N/P14L, promotes significant increases in the bimolecular rate constant of PSI reduction, both withSynechocystis and Anabaena PSI. Whereas the R86Q mutant does not significantly change its reactivity against cyanobacterial PSI, the R86E mutant shows a lower efficiency with both cyanobacterial photosystems (Table II). Regarding mutations in position 53, both mutants show a significantly higher efficiency with bothSynechocystis and Anabaena photosystems, rendering similar values to those obtained with the M33N Pc (TableII).Table IIBimolecular rate constants (k2) for the reduction of photosystem I from different sources by Prochlorothrix wild-type and mutant plastocyaninsk 2 × 10−5PlastocyaninSpinach PSISynechocystisPSIAnabaena PSIm−1s −1WT2.012.028.0P14LaValues from Ref. 11.18.0130.0150.0M33N1.845.0180.0M33N/P14L4.0170.058.0R86Q0.410.040.0R86E1.74.010.0P53A0.758.0220.0P53E1.751.0220.0SynechocystisPcNDbND, not determined.90.0NDAnabaenaPcNDND700.0a Values from Ref. 11Navarro J.A.

Open table in a new tab To determine structural changes in the protein introduced by these mutations and observe their dynamic behavior, we have run 1 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for WT and the P14L, M33N, and P53E mutants. The stability of the simulation was checked by monitoring temperature, density, and total energy parameters. The calculated average root mean standard deviation (r.m.s.d.) for all atoms was less than 2 Å (TableIII), suggesting that proteins are able to maintain their global structure. The introduction into the protein of non-native amino acids leads to the rearrangement of protein structure, which can be monitored through the changes in the r.m.s.d. In case of Pc, the copper center determines its function, thus the alteration of the copper center geometry by mutations can be assessed by r.m.s.d. of its ligands. The calculated data are presented in Table III. It can be seen that in the P14L mutant there is slight displacement of all copper ligands, suggesting that this mutant has a slightly altered geometry, which in its turn affects midpoint redox potential of the protein as reported previously (Table I and Ref. 11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). On the contrary, in the M33N mutant the three ligands have the same position except for His-39, which is spatially adjacent to residue 33. The higher r.m.s.d. for His-39 in WT is a result of fluctuations of the Met-33 side chain. Hydrogen bond analysis suggests that there is a hydrogen bond from sulfur to the backbone HN hydrogen of His-39 (Table IV and Fig.4). In the case of asparagine, which has a shorter side chain and smaller radius of oxygen compared with that of sulfur, there is a change in H-bonding pattern around the copper center. Lastly, MD analysis of the P53E mutation shows that Glu-53 yields alterations in the protein backbone of the short α-helix proposed to interact with the PsaA protein of the PSI core (TableIII) (13Myshkin E. Leontis N.B. Bullerjahn G.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3305-3313Google Scholar). The WT and other mutants adopt similar conformations in this helical region (Table III).Table IIISummary of the structural statistics for selected Cu center ligands and the eastern face residues 51–55 from WT and P14L, M33N and P53E mutant PcWTP14LM33NP53EAll atoms1.591.791.591.80His-390.210.150.150.16Cys-820.170.120.170.14His-850.150.220.150.20Met-900.240.350.240.22Residues 51–55 (backbone)0.360.320.330.46 Open table in a new tab Table IVPercentage of the occupied hydrogen bonds for H-bond donors and acceptors of WT and M33N mutants, calculated from MD simulationsWTM33NSD (M33)OD1NH1NH2%%%%His-39 N-H29.04.4Ala-61 O24.6Ala-63 O50.0Gly-65 O32.9 Open table in a new tab Reverting the exclusive methionine at position 33 in Prochlorothrix Pc to the standard asparagine in other Pcs yields enhanced k et while maintaining unaltered the association constant for (Pc-PSI) complex formation. This effect is qualitatively similar to that previously observed for mutations reverting the unique proline inProchlorothrix Pc to the standard leucine (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar), although about two-times higher k et values are reported here (Table I). Similarly, the increased efficiency of the P14L mutant in electron transfer toward heterospecific PSI (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar) is also seen in Met-33 mutants toward cyanobacterial PSI (Table II). Taken together, these results indicate that reverting the peculiar hydrophobic patch ofProchlorothrix Pc to the standard configuration promotes significantly increased electron transfer efficiencies, in agreement with the proposed role of this area as providing an adequate hydrophobic surface for the electron transfer step (3Hope A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1456: 5-26Google Scholar). We have carried out a MD study in order to better explain the greater reactivity of the M33N mutant as compared with WT Pc (Table III). The residue at position 33 is adjacent to the copper-ligand His-39. As a result, there is a slight displacement of His-39 (r.m.s.d. 0.217) in WT compared with M33N (0.147) because of the bigger side chain of methionine. Also, there is a hydrogen bond from S.D. of Met-33 to the backbone N of His-39, which is absent in Asn-33 because of its small side chain and smaller oxygen radius (Fig. 4). Replacement of methionine by asparagine rearranges the H-bonding network within the protein by formation of novel bonds (Table IV). Thus, the MD studies indicate that when Met-33 is changed to the canonical asparagine, the internal organization (H-bond network) changes around the Cu site. Such changes are not reflected in significantly altered redox potential, so the increases in rates are probably because of decreased donor/acceptor distance, yielding subtle changes in conformation with a better fit to PSI. The similar kinetic behavior of M33N and M33N/P14L mutants can be explained by assuming that the optimization of the PSI-Pc interaction promoted by the M33N mutation cannot be improved by additional mutation of Pro-14. A GRAMM (30Vakser I.A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 371-377Google Scholar) computational simulation suggested an interaction between the Prochlorothrix Pc eastern face and a short β-sheet in the PsaA subunit of PSI. Pro-53 is located in the middle of a short α-helix in Pc (13Myshkin E. Leontis N.B. Bullerjahn G.S. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 3305-3313Google Scholar). In fact, altering Pc at this site abolished complex formation with PSI in both P53A and P53E mutants, which surprisingly also leads to an increased electron transfer efficiency. Thus, it is clear that Pro-53 is important in the Pc-PSI interaction, acting by fixing the electron transfer complex in a non-optimized configuration. Replacement of this proline group appears to promote the breakdown of specific interactions with PSI, allowing enhanced electron transfer. This seems to be a general feature of Prochlorothrix Pc, because replacement of Pro-53 also promotes increased electron transfer efficiencies toward other cyanobacterial PSIs, although not toward the spinach photosystem. MD analyses reveal that the P53E mutation affects the geometry of the protein backbone within the interacting Pc α-helix (residues 51–55, Table IV), likely yielding a more flexible, less hydrophobic structure that may not interact with the PsaA β-sheet. Breaking this interaction site may result in collisional interactions that minimize donor-acceptor distance and hence improve reactivity. Cyanobacterial Pcs contain just one arginine residue (numbered Arg-88 in spinach) proposed to be crucial in PSI interaction because its substitution makes Anabaena Pc unable to reduce PSI (5De la Rosa M.A. Navarro J.A. Dı́az-Quintana A. De la Cerda B. Molina-Heredia F.P. Balme A. Murdoch P.S. Dı́az-Moreno I. Durán R.V. Hervás M. Bioelectrochemistry. 2002; 55: 41-45Google Scholar, 14Molina-Heredia F.P. Hervás M. Navarro J.A. De la Rosa M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 601-605Google Scholar). Mutating the equivalent Arg-86 inProchlorothrix promotes a decrease inK A but to a lesser extent increasesk et, the R86E mutant yielding a more pronounced effect. Although ionic strength effects are not observed in both mutants, overall these data suggest a role for electrostatics in helping to establish a docked conformation. The effects are not as pronounced as when such mutations are introduced intoAnabaena, showing that in the peculiarProchlorothrix Pc the role played by Arg-86 is not essential for the interaction with PSI. Furthermore, weakening specific interactions of this arginine with PSI groups by its substitution actually optimizes the electron transfer process. On the other hand, introducing a negative charge at position 86 has a negative effect on the bimolecular rate constants with heterospecific PSI, yielding the lower k 2 values of all theProchlorothrix Pc mutants tested until now (Table II) (11Navarro J.A. Myshkin E. De la Rosa M.A. Bullerjahn G.S. Hervás M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37501-37505Google Scholar). These data confirm a role for this arginine in helping to establish an efficient Pc-PSI interaction in other cyanobacteria distinct fromProchlorothrix. The data presented here confirm previous investigations indicating that Prochlorothrix Pc presents an unique electron donating mechanism to PSI. This process is based in the formation of an electron transfer complex mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of PSI with an altered site 1 in Pc. However, the electron transfer complex is not optimized in a productive configuration; mutations in the hydrophobic patch promote increased electron transfer rates without altering Pc-PSI association constants, and mutations in the east face decrease K A while increasing k et. Thus, by reverting the Pc hydrophobic patch to the standard configuration, and/or weakening complex formation, the reactivity of Pc toward its PSI is enhanced."
