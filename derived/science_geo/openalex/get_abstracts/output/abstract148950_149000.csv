https://openalex.org/W2056736540,"Jasplakinolide paradoxically stabilizes actin filaments in vitro, but in vivo it can disrupt actin filaments and induce polymerization of monomeric actin into amorphous masses. A detailed analysis of the effects of jasplakinolide on the kinetics of actin polymerization suggests a resolution to this paradox. Jasplakinolide markedly enhances the rate of actin filament nucleation. This increase corresponds to a change in the size of actin oligomer capable of nucleating filament growth from four to approximately three subunits, which is mechanistically consistent with the localization of the jasplakinolide-binding site at an interface of three actin subunits. Because jasplakinolide both decreases the amount of sequestered actin (by lowering the critical concentration of actin) and augments nucleation, the enhancement of polymerization by jasplakinolide is amplified in the presence of actin-monomer sequestering proteins such as thymosin β4. Overall, the kinetic parameters in vitro define the mechanism by which jasplakinolide induces polymerization of monomeric actin in vivo. Expected consequences of jasplakinolide function are consistent with the experimental observations and include de novo nucleation resulting in disordered polymeric actin and in insufficient monomeric actin to allow for remodeling of stress fibers.

Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In vivo data suggests that jasplakinolide-treated prostate cancer cells have both decreased labeling of F-actin and decreased amounts of rhodamine-phalloidin bound to cell extracts (2.Sendarowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriquez J. Crews P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), results that could be explained by the observation that jasplakinolide and phalloidin bind competitively to actin (1.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Duncan K.L.K Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, however,in vivo data also convincingly show that jasplakinolide disrupts actin filaments with alterations in cellular architecture (2.Sendarowicz A.M.J. Kaur G. Sainz E. Laing C. Inman W.D. Rodriquez J. Crews P. Malspeis L. Grever M.R. Sausville E.A. Duncan K.L.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,3.Spector I. Braet F. Shochet N.R. Bubb M.R. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1999; 47: 18-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), an effect that cannot be explained simply by competitive binding. We now present kinetic data characterizing the steady state and time-dependent in vitro interactions between jasplakinolide and actin that provide a plausible explanation for the effects of jasplakinolide on actin distribution in cultured cells. Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from frozen muscle (Pel-Freez, Rogers, AR) in buffer G (5.0 mmTris, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% sodium azide, pH 7.8) (4.Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4865-4871Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Non-muscle actin from bovine brain was prepared by the method of Ruscha and Himes (5.Ruscha M.F. Himes R.H. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 3: 351-360Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Muscle and non-muscle pyrenyl-labeled actins1 were prepared with 0.67–0.95 mol of label/mol of protein using the method of Kouyama and Mihashi (6.Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Labeled and unlabeled actins were further purified by gel filtration on Superose 12 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thymosin β4 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Vivian Nachmias and was inserted in a pET-11a vector, expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli, and purified as described previously (7.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Jasplakinolide was a gift from Drs. Phillip Crews and Yoel Kashman or was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and was diluted in Me2SO to 100 μm for the in vivo experiments and to 1.41 mm for the in vitro experiments. Rat embryonic fibroblasts (REF52) were grown on glass coverslips in 90% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (50 IU penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Jasplakinolide was added to the cells at final concentrations of 50–300 nm, and cells were examined over a 1–24-h period. For F-actin staining treated and untreated cells were washed 2× in PBS, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at 21 °C, washed 3× with PBS, and permeabilized by dipping in acetone at −20 °C for 5 min. After permeabilization, Texas Red phalloidin solutions (Molecular Probes Inc.) were applied to the cells for 20 min at 21 °C. REF52 cells were then washed 4× with PBS and mounted on microscope slides in a Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc.) to visualize the nucleus. Cells were examined by epifluorescence with a Nikon Diaphot microscope with 63× oil immersion lens using a three-dye filter set (DAPI/fluorescein/Texas Red) (Omega Optical) and photographed using Kodak Gold MAX print film or Elite Chrome 400 slide film. Color prints and slides were digitally scanned and transferred to Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software for color channels splitting and figure assembly. Pyrenyl-labeled rabbit muscle actin or bovine brain actin was converted to Mg2+-actin by the addition of 125 μm EGTA and 50 μmMgCl2 and after 15 min was polymerized to Mg2+-F-actin (20 μm) by the addition of MgCl2 to 2.0 mm. The time course of depolymerization was followed after dilution of actin to 2.2 μm in Mg-G buffer (buffer G plus 50 μmMgCl2 and 125 μm EGTA) at 22 °C in a steady state fluorimeter with excitation 365.6 and emission 386.6 nm. Samples were removed from the fluorimeter, and Me2SO or concentrated stock solution of jasplakinolide in Me2SO was added at 75 s, and the samples were mixed and returned to the fluorimeter at 90 s. Actin (5% pyrenyl-actin) was converted to Mg2+-actin as before and was polymerized by the addition of MgCl2 to 0.35 mm (final actin concentration, 20 μm). Individual samples were made by dilution of the original stock of F-actin without a change in buffer conditions, and the final fluorescence (same conditions as for the stabilization assay) was read at 4 and 24 h after dilution. For the measurement of elongation rates, gel-filtered cross-linked F-actin seeds were prepared as described previously (8.Terry D.R. Spector I. Higa T. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7841-7845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by cross-linking (unlabeled) F-actin withN,N′-phenylenebismaleimide and pooling the gel-filtered fractions containing actin oligomers. Prior to the experiments employing jasplakinolide, preliminary data confirmed that the initial rate of polymerization was proportional to both the concentration of added seeds and to the concentration of free actin, which was large relative to the critical concentration of actin (see Equation 2 below). Actin (5% pyrenyl-actin) was converted to Mg2+-actin in a glass cuvette. After 15 min, jasplakinolide, seeds, and MgCl2 to a final concentration of 0.35 mm were all added simultaneously; the samples were mixed and the fluorescence intensity was measured as a function of time. At fixed total actin concentration, the initial slope of the fluorescence change was assumed to be proportional to the elongation rate (8.Terry D.R. Spector I. Higa T. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7841-7845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Depolymerization rates were measured using Mg2+-F-actin stock as for steady state measurements, with dilution to 3 μm with varying concentrations of jasplakinolide. Latrunculin (5.0 μm) was added to the diluted sample to keep the free G-actin concentration less than 0.05 μm during the time it took the first 10% of F-actin to depolymerize. The fluorescence change was linear over this time interval, consistent with the assumptions that few filaments completely depolymerized in this amount of time and that re-addition of subunits to polymer was negligible (9.Kristofferson D. Karr T.L. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8567-8572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Walsh T.P. Weber A. Davis K. Bonder E. Mooseker M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6099-6102Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Actin (5%-pyrenyl-actin) was converted to Mg2+-actin, and polymerization was induced with the addition of MgCl2 to a final concentration of 2.0 mm (or in some cases, 2.0 mm MgCl2with 100 mm KCl), and the time course was followed at 22 °C. The time course of polymerization was modeled as summarized by Tobacman and Korn (11.Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with implicit assumptions as detailed by Bubb and Korn (12.Bubb M.R. Korn E.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), including the specific assumption that the concentration of oligomeric species of actin are negligible during the entire polymerization reaction. This assumption is specifically addressed in the current work in experiments employing sedimentation velocity. In brief, the rates of nucleation, d[C n]/dt, and elongation, d[A f]/dt, are defined by two differential equations (Equations 1 and 2). d[Cn]/dt=Kn·kc+·[A] (N−1)·([A]−Cc)Equation 1 d[Af]/dt=kc+·[Cn]·([A]−Cc)Equation 2 where [C n] is the molar concentration of nuclei; [A f] is the concentration of polymerized actin subunits; [A] is the actin monomer concentration;k c+ is the sum of the rate constants for elongation at the two filament ends; C c is the critical concentration of actin; and N is the number of subunits in a nucleus, i.e. the smallest aggregate for which elongation is more likely than dissociation. Numerical integration of Equations 1 and 2 produces a curve for the time course of polymerization that is dependent on the actin concentration, the critical concentration, and a parameterK n·(k c +)2. The value for C c was determined experimentally from steady state data as described later; therefore, for a given value ofN, the only parameter required to fit data for the time course of polymerization is the product ofK n·(k c +)2. In the absence of jasplakinolide, the best fit to data for the time course of actin polymerization was previously shown to occur withn = 4 (11.Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The time course in the presence of thymosin β4 is modeled with the additional assumption that actin monomer binds to thymosin β4 to form a complex that does not interact with F-actin. The interaction between thymosin β4 and actin, with equilibrium dissociation constant K d, is assumed to maintain a rapid equilibrium with respect to the polymerization reaction. Actin (15 μm) was incubated in Mg-G buffer at 4 °C for 24 h alone or with 15 μm phalloidin or 2 μm jasplakinolide. Samples of 400 μl were loaded into double sector analytical ultracentrifuge cells and were run in the Beckman XLA centrifuge at 53,000 rpm at 4 °C. Actin that cleared the meniscus within 7 min at 53,000 rpm, as determined from a comparison with a preliminary scan obtained at 3,000 rpm, was considered to be F-actin (13.Attri A.K. Lewis M.S. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6815-6824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Absorbance scans were obtained at 12- or 13-min intervals at 280 nm. Sedimentation coefficients were calculated using the second moment analysis method (14.Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, New York1959: 75-81Google Scholar). Translational diffusion coefficients were determined according to the procedure of Muramatsu and Minton (15.Muramatsu N. Minton A.P. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 345-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), utilizing the functionz(t) = π·d·t/4 +K, where z(t) is a nearly linear transformation of the theoretical gradient predicted by Fick's law of diffusion for a homogeneous solute. The translational diffusion coefficient, d, is then 4/π times dz/dt, andd 20,w is calculated using interpolated values for viscosity and density of 5 mm Tris obtained from standard tables. At these actin concentrations, the hydrodynamic coefficients can be assumed to be independent of actin concentration (16.Lewis M.S. Maruyama K. Carroll W.R. Kominz D.R. Laki K. Biochemistry. 1963; 2: 34-39Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The distribution of F-actin in untreated cells (Fig.1 A) shows a dense network of parallel stress fibers that remained intact following 2 h exposure to 50 (Fig. 1 B) or 100 nm (Fig. 1 C) jasplakinolide. With 50 nm there was only a slight increase in the fluorescence intensity of F-actin bundles in the cell center, and the short term effects of 100 nm were manifest by the formation of actin aggregates at the perinuclear region. However, exposure of cells to 200 nm jasplakinolide for 2 h (Fig. 1 D) resulted in almost complete depletion of F-actin from the central region of many cells, which assumed a diamond shape and displayed thick F-actin bundles and aggregates at the cell margins. Exposure of cells to 50 and 200 nm jasplakinolide for 24 h resulted in the appearance of large masses of F-actin. However, although with 50 nm cell shape was not altered, stress fibers were still visible, and the actin masses were clumped primarily in the perinuclear region (Fig. 1 E), and with 200 nm, cells contracted and most stress fibers disappeared and were replaced by large F-actin masses that were located either in the perinuclear region or in the two poles of the cell (Fig.1 G). Jasplakinolide prevented depolymerization of both rabbit skeletal muscle and bovine brain actin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The time required to achieve stabilization of F-actin was less than or equal to the time required to mix the samples (15 s). Previously we had reported that jasplakinolide binds to muscle F-actin with K d of 15–300 nm (1.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Duncan K.L.K Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The continuation of the dose response to 2.0 μm for both muscle and non-muscle actin without saturation suggests that F-actin has at least a few binding sites with much lower affinity than previously reported that must be saturated to provide maximal inhibition of depolymerization. Perhaps at nearly full occupancy of binding sites along a filament, additional binding of jasplakinolide occurs only with negative cooperativity. Four hours after the addition of jasplakinolide to Mg2+-F-actin, jasplakinolide causes a dose-dependent decrease in the critical concentration of actin from 1.8 μm to 0.8 and 0.2 μm by 0.15 and 0.30 μm jasplakinolide, respectively (Fig. 3 A). After 24 h the data show that even at low jasplakinolide concentrations,C c is decreased to 0.2 to 0.4 μm (Fig.3 B). At 24 h the effect of jasplakinolide no longer shows a dose response, suggesting saturation of relevant binding sites even at the lowest concentration (0.15 μm). The MgCl2 concentration of 0.35 mm was chosen specifically to provide a high enough value of C c in the absence of drug, so that any decreases caused by jasplakinolide could be accurately measured. Jasplakinolide increased the rate constant for elongation in a seeded polymerization assay by a factor of up to 2 (Fig. 4). This effect was saturable at low concentrations of jasplakinolide (∼100 nm). Jasplakinolide caused less than a 5% increase in the elongation rate in the absence of seeds, i.e. for the conditions employed in the elongation assay, jasplakinolide did not nucleate filament growth (data not shown). As another control, elongation rates measured with the same concentrations of phalloidin replacing jasplakinolide caused a 0–20% increase in the elongation rate (data not shown), consistent with a previous report (17.Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The effects of jasplakinolide on the depolymerization rate constant (from both filament ends), k c−, showed a nearly linear dependence on jasplakinolide concentration up to the highest concentration employed (0.3 μm), but since the total actin concentration was 3.0 μm, these values do not represent saturation of filament-binding sites (Fig. 4). The relative rate constants k c+ andk c− provide values for calculation ofC c, demonstrating a 6.2-fold decrease inC c at 0.15 μm jasplakinolide and 20-fold decrease at 0.3 μm jasplakinolide (Fig. 4,inset). The disparity between these results and those for steady state measurements is discussed later. As previously demonstrated, jasplakinolide augments the rate of polymerization of Mg2+-actin (Fig.5 A). For comparison, in the absence of jasplakinolide, 1.3 μm actin exhibited a 5-fold increase in fluorescence after 2000 s (data not shown), but a similar 5-fold increase occurred after 80 s in the presence of 2.0 μm jasplakinolide (Fig. 5 A). Varying concentrations of Mg2+-actin polymerized with 2.0 μm jasplakinolide can be modeled reasonably well assuming a nucleus (N) of 3 subunits (Fig. 5 A) and a critical concentration of zero (calculated at steady state as in Fig.3; data not shown). Then,K n·(k c+)2 = 9.4·1013 s−2m−3. When assuming a nucleus of 4 subunits, the data can be best fit withK n·(k c+)2 = 1.8·1020 s−2m−4, but the model then predicts that polymerization will occur faster than observed for total actin concentrations of more than 0.8 μm and slower than observed for less than 0.5 μm (Fig. 5 A). Not shown in Fig. 5 Ais the observation that individual curves vary slightly on repetition (Fig. 5 B does give an indication of the variability between samples), but in three series of assays, the observation that the data could be better fit with N of 3 than N of 4 was true for each series. The differential equations for nucleation-elongation kinetics predicts that the size of the nucleus can be determined from an ln/ln plot of the actin concentration versus the time to reach a fixed percentage of polymerized actin (11.Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Oosawa F. Asakura S. Thermodynamics of the Polymerization of Protein. Academic Press, New York1975: 47-51Google Scholar). Then, assuming the free actin concentration is large relative to the critical concentration, the slope is one-half the nucleus size. This assumption is satisfied employing data (done in triplicate) as shown in Fig. 5 A. The time required for 50% of the actin to polymerize was utilized, and the results are plotted in Fig. 5 B. Control data in the absence of jasplakinolide show a slope of 1.98, consistent with previous reports of a tetrameric nucleus (11.Tobacman L.S. Brenner S.L. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8806-8812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the data for 2.0 μm jasplakinolide show a slope of 1.62, most consistent with a trimeric nucleus. A comparison of phalloidin (2.0 μm) with jasplakinolide in the same series of assays showed, as previously reported for Ca2+-actin (17.Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), that phalloidin had only a minor effect on the rate of unseeded filament assembly of Mg2+-actin but did cause a modest reduction in slope to 1.79 (Fig. 5 B). The binding site for phalloidin on actin has been previously identified and is at the interface of three actin subunits (19.Heidecker M. Yan-Marriott Y. Marriott G. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11017-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The finding that jasplakinolide stabilizes an actin trimer sufficiently to ensure that it will elongate rather than dissociate might have been anticipated if jasplakinolide binds at the same site as phalloidin. Whereas it has been proven that jasplakinolide binds competitively with phalloidin (1.Bubb M.R. Senderowicz A.M.J. Duncan K.L.K Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14869-14871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is no direct evidence that the two drugs compete for the same binding site. At a fixed concentration of Mg2+-actin (1.3 μm) and jasplakinolide (2.0 μm), varying concentrations of thymosin β4were added prior to initiation of polymerization with a final concentration of 2.0 mm MgCl2 (Fig.6 A). For comparison, the polymerization of 1.3 μm Mg2+-actin was nearly completely inhibited by 3.0 μm thymosin β4 in the absence of jasplakinolide, with an increase in fluorescence intensity of approximately 2% in 1500 s (Fig.6 A). Steady state fluorescence intensity was measured in the presence of thymosin β4 after 24 h (Fig.6 A, inset). The effects of jasplakinolide on the steady state F-actin concentration in the presence of thymosin β4 do not fit perfectly with a model of sequestration of actin by thymosin β4 in a 1 to 1 stoichiometric complex (compare solid and dashed line, Fig. 6 A, inset). The best fit to such a model suggests a K d of 0.39 μm for thymosin β4 and actin monomer. Additionally, modeling the entire time course of polymerization of actin assuming values forK n, k c+, andC c as determined in Fig. 5 A and assuming rapid equilibrium binding of thymosin β4 to actin withK d = 0.39 μm produces results different from those observed. For example, a solution to the differential Equations 1 and 2 predicts that in the presence of 3 μm thymosin β4, 2.0 μmjasplakinolide, and 1.3 μm actin, approximately 5% of the actin would polymerize after 1000 s, in contrast to the observed rate (18% polymerized at 1000 s) demonstrated in Fig.6 A. Therefore the combination of a lower critical concentration with less sequestered actin and the large increase inK n·(k c+)2are not entirely sufficient to explain the ability of jasplakinolide to induce polymerization in the presence of thymosin β4. Apparently, actin bound to thymosin β4 is participating in the polymerization process, either during nucleation or elongation. Previous investigators have suggested that this might also be the case in the absence of jasplakinolide (7.Carlier M.-F. Didry D. Erk I. Lepault J. Van Troys M.L. Vandekerckhove J. Perelroizen I. Yin H. Doi Y. Pantaloni D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9231-9239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), but others have not found evidence for anything other than monomer sequestration by thymosin β4 (20.Weber A. Nachmias V.T. Pennise C.R. Pring M. Safer D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6179-6185Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A previous report (21.Reichert A. Heintz D. Voelter W. Mihelic M. Faulstich H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 347: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that thymosin β4-actin complexes could directly associate with phalloidin-stabilized actin neglected the fact that phalloidin, like jasplakinolide, lowers the critical concentration and therefore decreases the amount of actin sequestered by thymosin β4(17.Estes J.E. Selden L.A. Gershman L.C. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Since jasplakinolide both decreases the critical concentration of actin (Figs. 3 and 4) and accelerates nucleation (Fig. 5), the effects of jasplakinolide on actin polymerization should be amplified in the presence of thymosin β4, where the drop in critical concentration should free up actin that would have been sequestered by thymosin β4 in the absence of jasplakinolide. Indeed, a comparison of Figs. 5 A and 6 A shows that at a total actin concentration of 1.3 μm, the maximum slope for actin polymerization is increased approximately 40-fold by 2.0 μm jasplakinolide (Fig. 2), whereas the comparative slopes in the presence of 3 μm thymosin β4show a 300-fold difference (Fig. 6 A). The effect of the addition of jasplakinolide under physiological conditions to cells rich in thymosin β4 can be illustrated in vitro (Fig. 6 B). Adding jasplakinolide to polymerized Mg2+-actin in a physiologic buffer (2.0 mm MgCl2 and 100 mmKCl) at steady state results in only a slight increase in polymer corresponding to a drop in critical concentration. However, adding jasplakinolide to a sample in the same buffer with the same amount of Mg2+-F-actin (and therefore, approximately the same initial fluorescence intensity), but with additional actin sequestered by thymosin β4, results in a rapid and large increase in actin polymer. The amplification of the effect of jasplakinolide in the presence of thymosin β4 can be best explained by the hypothesis that jasplakinolide markedly decreases the critical concentration of actin, resulting in an abrupt decrease in the amount of actin sequestered by thymosin β4. In fact, the steady state level of fluorescence achieved after the addition of 3.0 μm jasplakinolide to a sample with 3.0 μmactin is independent of the concentration of thymosin β4, implying that to the extent measurable, there is no actin sequestered by thymosin β4 in a physiologic buffer after addition of jasplakinolide, i.e. the critical concentration is effectively zero (data not shown). If the actin concentration is adjusted so that the initial rate of polymerization of Mg2+-actin in physiologic buffer (2.0 mmMgCl2 and 100 mm KCl) is similar in the presence (3.0 μm actin) and absence (1.0 μmactin) of 2.8 μm thymosin β4, then the same samples polymerized in the presence of 2.0 μmjasplakinolide are markedly different (Fig. 6 B,inset). A much greater extent of polymerization is observed in the sample containing thymosin β4 as a consequence of the drop in critical concentration. Conditions were determined in which approximately 20% of 15 μm actin would pellet as F-actin during sedimentation velocity experiments, implying a critical concentration of about 12 μm. In Mg-G buffer with a 24 h incubation, this required either 2 μm jasplakinolide or 15 μm phalloidin. Residual non-polymeric actin sedimented as though largely monomeric for both the jasplakinolide- and phalloidin-treated actin. The sedimentation coefficients of the monomeric fraction in the presence of jasplakinolide was similar to that previously reported for monomeric actin ( s20,w0 = 3.2) (8.Terry D.R. Spector I. Higa T. Bubb M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7841-7845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The diffusion coefficient for the non-polymeric fraction of actin treated with jasplakinolide was also consistent with expectations for an actin monomer ( D20,w0 = 7.53; Fig.7) (22.Montague C.

The phalloidin-treated actin yielded a slightly larger sedimentation coefficient ( s20,w0 = 3.5) and an indeterminate diffusion coefficient related to dispersion of a heterogeneous sample, both results being consistent with the presence of a small percentage of oligomeric actin.

The 2.6 A X-ray crystallographic structure of the Cdc42/RhoGDI complex reveals two important sites of interaction between GDI and Cdc42. First, the amino-terminal regulatory arm of the GDI binds to the switch I and II domains of Cdc42 leading to the inhibition of both GDP dissociation and GTP hydrolysis. Second, the geranylgeranyl moiety of Cdc42 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket within the immunoglobulin-like domain of the GDI molecule leading to membrane release. The structural data demonstrate how GDIs serve as negative regulators of small GTP-binding proteins and how the isoprenoid moiety is utilized in this critical regulatory interaction."

The crystal structure of human eRF1 to 2.8 A resolution, combined with mutagenesis analyses of the universal GGQ motif, reveals the molecular mechanism of release factor activity. The overall shape and dimensions of eRF1 resemble a tRNA molecule with domains 1, 2, and 3 of eRF1 corresponding to the anticodon loop, aminoacyl acceptor stem, and T stem of a tRNA molecule, respectively. The position of the essential GGQ motif at an exposed tip of domain 2 suggests that the Gln residue coordinates a water molecule to mediate the hydrolytic activity at the peptidyl transferase center. A conserved groove on domain 1, 80 A from the GGQ motif, is proposed to form the codon recognition site."

Cleavage of caspase-9 by calpain generates truncated caspase-9 that is unable to activate caspase-3 in cell lysates. Furthermore, direct cleavage of caspase-9 by calpain blocks dATP and cytochrome-c induced caspase-3 activation.

An overload of Ca2+ by excitotoxicity induces both necrotic and apoptotic cell death (1.McGinnis K.M. Wang K.W. Gnegy M.E. J.

Caspases are unique cysteine proteases that are synthesized as inactive precursors and activated during apoptosis (6.Cryns V. Yuan J.

Caspases can be classified into two subclasses according to the length of their N-terminal prodomains. Caspases-1, -2, -8, -9, and -10, which contain long prodomains, are believed to act as upstream caspases (6.Cryns V. Yuan J.

This class of caspases is activated through interaction with specific adapter proteins. In the case of caspase-9, the presence of dATP and cytochrome-cwill initiate the interaction between Apaf-1 and caspase-9, which in turn activates caspase-9 by autocatalysis (8.Liu X. Kim C.N. Yang J. Jemmerson R. Wang X. Cell. 1996; 86: 147-157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4484) Google Scholar, 9.Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X.

The interaction between caspase-9 and Apaf-1 is mediated by the prodomain of caspase-9 and the CARD domain of Apaf-1 (10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Therefore, the prodomain of caspase-9 plays an important role in its activation and mediation of cytochrome-c and dATP-induced apoptosis. Calpains are Ca2+-dependent intracellular cysteine proteases (11.Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 15: 721-732Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Two major calpains have been identified (11.Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 15: 721-732Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 12.Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), μ-calpain (calpain I) and m-calpain (calpain II), which are distinguished by the optimal Ca2+ concentration for maximal activity. Activation of calpains is initiated by Ca2+ and shows autocleavage of both large and small subunits. Unlike caspases that require specific amino acid sequences at the cleavage sites, calpains show no apparent sequence preferences. It is believed that the calpain cleavage site is structure-dependent (11.Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 15: 721-732Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Several calpain substrates have been identified including p53 (13.Krbbutat M.H.G. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 460-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), IκBα (14.Han Y.

Orrenius S. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 1028-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Even though there is evidence to show that calpains are involved in apoptosis, the direct relationship between calpain and caspase activation has not been demonstrated. Using anin vitro assay, we show here that caspases can be cleaved by a cytosolic factor(s) in the presence of Ca2+. Analysis with a broad spectrum of protease inhibitors suggests that this factor is calpain. Recombinant calpain II generates similar size cleavage products as the cytosolic factor. Treatment of cells with Ca2+ ionophore leads to rapid activation of calpain and cleavage of caspases. These data suggest that caspases can be directly cleaved by calpain. Two specific calpain cleavage sites have been identified in caspase-9. Cleavage of caspase-9 by calpain leads to the inhibition of dATP and cytochrome-c-dependent caspase-3 cleavage. Our data thus suggest an alternative way to modulate apoptosis by intracellular calcium signals. The caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-fmk, Z-DEVD-fmk, and Z-YVAD-fmk were purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). Calpain inhibitors I and II were obtained from Calbiochem. All other inhibitors and materials were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. For lysate preparation, MCF-7 cells, HeLa cells, and SH-SY5Y cells were grown to confluence in RPMI 1640 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum, respectively. Cells were harvested and pellets were resuspended with an equal volume of cell extraction buffer (50 mmHEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 5 mmDTT1 and 1 mmPMSF. After 30 min of incubation on ice, cells were lysed by gently passing through a 23 G needle ten times and centrifuged for 30 min on a microcentrifuge. The resultant supernatant (cell lysate) was used for biochemical assay. The total protein concentration was measured with the Bradford assay. For the time course experiment, SH-SY5Y cells were plated at 75% confluence overnight. 1 μm A23187 and 1 mm CaCl2 were added into the culture for various times and washed away by serum-free medium, and cell lysate was made as described above. Caspases-7 and -8 in pET15b (Novagen) and caspase-9 and its mutants in pET21b (Novagen) were translated using an in vitro transcription and translation kit (Promega) according to the instruction of the manufacturer and purified as described by Li et al.

Proteins were transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) followed by exposure to phosphoimaging plate for 1 h and visualized with the phosphoimager. For inhibition assay, HeLa cell lysate was incubated with different amounts of recombinant calpain II at 30 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of dATP and cytochrome-c to activate caspase-3 as described by Li et al. (10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Bacteria strains, which express both large and small subunits of rat calpain II in the same cells, were a generous gift of Dr. John Elce (12.Elce J.S. Hegadorn C. Gauthier S. Vince J.W. Davies P.L. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). pET21b caspase-9 (C287A) was transformed into BL21 (DE3) and used to express recombinant caspase-9. Procedures for the purification of His-tagged calpain II and caspase-9 were essentially the same as described by Li et al. (10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Aliquots of fractions from Ni2+ column (Qiagen) were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining to determine the positive fractions. Caspase-9 (C287A) was further purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCL, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF). The column was eluted with the same buffer. Aliquots of fractions (1 ml) were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and Western blot analysis. 5 μg of caspase-9 (C287A) was cleaved in the presence of 1 μg of rat recombinant calpain II and 3 mm CaCl2. Proteins were transferred to Hybond C nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot analysis and PVDF membrane for peptide sequencing. Western blot analysis was performed as described by Li et al. (10.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Dilutions of 1:2000 for the rabbit anti-caspase-7 and -9 antibodies (PharMingen), 1:2000 for mouse anti-calpain small subunit antibody (Chemicon), and 1:5000 of mouse anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were used in the analyses. For peptide sequencing, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was stained with 0.1% amino black in 10% acetic acid. Bands were excised and subjected to Edman sequencing. To identify factors involved in Ca2+-mediated apoptosis, an in vitro biochemical assay was established in which radiolabeled caspase-7 was added to MCF-7 cell lysates in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig.1 A). Cleavage of caspase-7 precursor was found to increase with increasing concentration of Ca2+. The pattern of cleavage products was different from dATP and cytochrome-c-induced cleavage which generated characteristic P10 and P20 fragments (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), suggesting that the Ca2+-dependent caspase-7 cleavage might generate proteolytically inactive caspase-7. Cleavage of caspase-7 was strongly inhibited by leupeptin and E64 (Fig.1 B) but not by 20 μm caspase inhibitors (DEVD-fmk, Z-VAD-fmk, and YVAD-fmk (Fig. 1 C)). These data suggest that proteases other than caspases are responsible for caspase-7 cleavage in the presence of Ca2+. Preincubation of DEVD at 100 μm, however, resulted in an inhibitory effect on caspase-7 cleavage, consistent with the reported nonspecific inhibition of additional proteases at this high concentration (6.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). We next tested for a direct involvement of calpains in the Ca2+-dependent caspase-7 cleavage based on the fact that calpains can be activated by Ca2+. Indeed preincubation of cell lysates with calpain inhibitors I (20 μm) and II (5 μm) resulted in full inhibition of caspase-7 cleavage (Fig. 1 D, lanes 4 and 6). Although the specificity of calpain inhibitors has been challenged, their primary targets are calpains (11.Sorimachi H. Ishiura S. Suzuki K. Biochem. J. 1997; 15: 721-732Crossref Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Higher concentrations of both inhibitors are required to achieve nonspecific inhibition of other proteases. Therefore, our data strongly suggest that calpain II is the protease responsible for caspase-7 cleavage in the lysate in the presence of Ca2+. To further verify this result, we tested the ability of recombinant rat calpain II (heterodimeric form including both large and small subunits) to directly cleave caspase-7 in vitro. As shown in Fig.1 E, in the presence of increasing amounts of Ca2+, calpain cleaves caspase-7 into a fragment of a size similar to that observed after cleavage by cytosolic factors (lanes 2 and 5). Leupeptin, E64, and calpain inhibitors all showed strong inhibition of this cleavage (data not shown). Therefore calpain appears to be the primary enzyme responsible for caspase-7 cleavage in the cell lysate upon addition of Ca2+, although we cannot rule out the possibility that other cellular factors may also contribute to the cleavage. Short prodomain caspases-3 and -6 were also cleaved by recombinant calpain II at higher concentration (5×) and did not generate P10 and P20 fragments (data not shown). Direct cleavage of long prodomain caspases such as caspase-8 and caspase-9 by calpain was also tested. Both caspase-8 and caspase-9 were cleaved by cytosolic proteins and the recombinant calpain II (Fig.2 A) in the presence of Ca2+, generating similar size fragments. Calpain inhibitors I and II, leupeptin, and E64 blocked the cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-9 by calpain, whereas caspase inhibitors showed no inhibition. The precise cleavage positions in caspase-9 were mapped using recombinant caspase-9 (Cys-287 to Ala). Caspase-9 harboring this mutation is defective in enzymatic activity and thus can be isolated as full-length proteins from bacteria. Incubation of recombinant caspase-9 (C287A) with calpain in the presence of Ca2+ yielded four cleaved products (C1, C2, C3, and C4, Fig. 2 B) which were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing. Full-length caspase-9 and C1 yielded no sequencing information presumably because of N-terminal modification and blockage of sequencing. Analyses of the size of C1, which is similar to caspase-3 cleavage product (Fig. 2 B, left panel, lanes 2 and 5), and peptide sequences of C2, C3, and C4 suggest that calpains cleaved caspase-9 at two positions after residues 115 and 330. Cleavage at amino acid residue 115 would generate truncated caspase-9 without the prodomain (C2). Cleavage at position 330, a well established caspase-3 cleavage site would generate the same product (C1) as that by caspase-3 cleavage. Consistent with the fact that calpain cleavage sites show no sequence conservation, single amino acid mutations at residues 330 (D→A), 287 (C→A), and 315 (caspase-9 cleavage site, D→A) did not reduce caspase-9 cleavage by calpain (Fig. 2 C). Time course experiments of caspase-9 cleavage by calpain showed the predominant accumulation of the C2 product (data not shown), suggesting that cleavage at position 115 is preferred. Because caspase-9 can be cleaved by calpain at position 330, a conserved caspase-3 cleavage site, we checked the possibility whether cleavage by calpain would lead to the activation of caspase-9 by using caspase-3 as a substrate. Because of the low level of endogenous calpain activity and strong induction by dATP and cytochrome-c in HeLa cell lysates, we performed the calpain cleavage of caspase-9 in HeLa cell lysates by adding exogenous recombinant calpain II. As shown in Fig.3 A, the presence of increasing amounts of calpain did not lead to caspase-3 activation. Caspase-9 was cleaved by calpain in this assay as monitored by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A, lower panel). Caspase-3 was cleaved in the presence of dATP and cytochrome-c, showing that the pathway for Apaf-1-mediated activation of caspase-9 and subsequent caspase-3 cleavage is intact. These data indicate strongly that cleavage of caspase-9 by calpain does not generate active caspase-9. We hypothesized that calpain cleavage at residue 115 of caspase-9 generates truncated caspase-9 without the prodomain and may be responsible for its inactivation and disruption of dATP and cytochrome-c-mediated caspase-3 activation. To test this, we incubated the cell lysate with recombinant calpain II in the presence of Ca2+ prior to the addition of dATP and cytochrome-c. No caspase-3 cleavage was observed when cell lysate was pre-incubated with 2 μg of calpain in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lane 7). Incubation of calpain or calcium alone prior to the addition of dATP and cytochrome-c did not inhibit caspase-3 cleavage. The inhibitory effect of calpain on caspase-3 cleavage can be reversed by the inactivation of calpain using calpain inhibitor II (Fig. 3 B, upper panel, lane 8). Western blot analysis showed a reduced amount of caspase-9 precursor in the presence of calpain and Ca2+ (Fig. 3 B, lower panel, lanes 6and 7), indicating that caspase-9 is cleaved by calpain in this reaction. Because caspase-3 was suggested to have a positive feedback on caspase-9 activity (6.Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 7.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of calpain on caspase-3 enzymatic activity and observed no inhibition in the presence of calpain (data not shown). Therefore, these data suggest that calpain cleavage of caspase-9 can indeed lead to the inactivation of caspase-9 and inhibition of dATP and cytochrome-C-induced caspase-3 cleavage. The direct cleavage of caspase-9 by calpain was further demonstratedin vivo in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells after Ca2+ ionophore (A23187) treatment. The time course of the treatment showed that activation of calpain in these cells is rapid (Fig. 4 A). Within 5 min after treatment, calpain was activated (Fig. 4 A, lane 4). Cleavage of both caspase-7 and caspase-9 correlated very well with calpain activation, with the appearance of cleaved products at 5 min (Fig. 4, B and C, lane 4). We have also shown here that calpain II inhibitor (5 μm) was able to block calpain activation and caspase cleavage (Fig. 4, lanes 7) suggesting that calpain II is responsible for the caspases-7 and 9 cleavage. Because autolysis of small subunit (common for calpain I and calpain II) was used as a marker for calpain activation, we cannot rule out the possibility that calpain I is also involved in caspase cleavage as both calpains demonstrated similar substrate specificity and a lower amount of calcium was required for the activation of calpain I. The specificity of calpain I and calpain II on the cleavage of caspases will be further demonstrated by using specific antibodies against large subunits of calpain I and calpain II which were shown to be autolysed during activation. Activation of calpain II and cleavage of caspases were not because of the activation of caspases as caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD) did not block calpain activation and caspase cleavage (Fig. 4, lane 8). Correlation of caspase cleavage and calpain activation was also observed in other cell types such as in HeLa cells and in MCF-7 cells (data not shown). These results are consistent with our in vitro data and strongly suggest that caspases are direct calpain substrates in vivo. We noticed that calpain activation by A23187 and caspase cleavagein vivo was not very efficient. However, this amount of caspase cleavage is physiologically relevant as pre-incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with A23187 for 30 min protected cells from etoposide and H7-induced apoptosis (data not shown). We also observed that the efficiency of caspase cleavage by calpain was affected by physiological states of the cells such as cell density and differentiation state (data not shown). Signals other than Ca2+ ionophores may be required to activate calpain more efficiently in vivo. We have shown here that caspases are direct substrates of calpains. Cleavage of caspase-7 by calpain II did not generate the characteristic P10 and P20 fragments which represent its active forms, but yielded inactive fragments. Upstream caspases such as caspase-8 and caspase-9 were also cleaved by calpain II. Two calpain cleavage sites in caspase-9 were identified and the C-terminal calpain cleavage site coincides with the caspase-3 cleavage site (D330). Cleavage at this position by calpain generates a similar fragment to that of caspase-3 cleavage (C1). However calpain cleavage of caspase-9 did not result in its activation. These data suggest that cleavage of caspase-9 at the appropriate position (adventitious proteolysis) may not lead to the activation of caspase-9, in agreement with a previous observation (16.Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 8359-8362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Unlike other caspases such as caspase-3 which are activated by proteolysis of precursor, cytosolic factors (such as Apaf-1) are required for generating active caspase-9 presumably by binding to caspase-9 (in the presence of dATP and cytochrome-c in the case of Apaf-1). Elevation of Ca2+ concentration in the cell lysate cannot initiation interaction between the cytosolic factors and caspase-9, thus caspase-9 activation and subsequent caspase-3 cleavage are not observed. We also demonstrate that calpain cleavage generates inactive caspase-9 and blocks cytochrome-c and dATP-induced caspase-3 activation in vitro. The inhibitory effect of calpain is rather intriguing as it represents a novel mechanism to regulate apoptosis by the elevation of intracellular Ca2+concentration and activation of calpains. This effect may be because of the cleavage of the prodomain of caspase-9 by calpain because it is crucial for caspase-9 self-activation and enzymatic activity by interacting with Apaf-1 (10.Li P.

This observation is contrary to the previous observation that inhibition of calpain blocks apoptosis in thymocytes (2.Squier M.K.T. Cohen J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3690-3697PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore inhibition of apoptosis by calpain is likely to be cell type-specific. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is an important signal for regulating apoptosis, such as the dephosphorylation of BAD by the Ca2+-dependent activation of calcineurin (18.Wang H.G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F. Mckeon F. Bobo T. Franke T. Reed J.C. Science. 1999; 284: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that Ca2+ ionophore treatment in SH-SY5Y cells induced rapid calpain activation and cleavage of caspase-9, preceding other biological or biochemical responses such as caspase activation. Calpain-dependent inhibition of apoptosis by cleavage of upstream caspases may be more typically associated with the transient increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration that occurs during excitation in neuronal cells or muscle cells. Our data thus suggest that regulation of apoptosis by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is in part through modulation of calpain activity and direct cleavage and subsequent inactivation of caspases.

Two-hybrid cloning and immunoprecipitation from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) showed that KDR binds to and promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Neither placental growth factor, which activates Flt1, epidermal growth factor (EGF), or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, indicating that KDR is uniquely important to PLCγ activation in HUVEC. By signaling through KDR, VEGF promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase, induced activation of Akt, protein kinase Cε (PKCε), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and promoted thymidine incorporation into DNA. VEGF activates PLCγ, PKCε, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase independently of one another. MEK, PLCγ, and to a lesser extent PKC, are in the pathway through which KDR activates MAPK.

A complex network of growth factors and cytokines regulates angiogenesis. Some factors, such as tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor, angiogenin, and prostaglandin E2, are believed to induce angiogenesis indirectly (1.Risau W.

Other factors that play a role in blood vessel development, such as the acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors and platelet-derived growth factor, are mitogens for many cell types. Vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF)1 is unique, being an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that promotes many of the events necessary for angiogenesis (3.Connolly D.T. J. Cell.

Both receptors are structurally similar to members of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor family and consist of an extracellular domain composed of seven immunoglobulin-like motifs, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase that is split by a kinase insert region, and a C-terminal tail (22.Shibuya M. Yamane A. Ikeda T. Tojo A. Matushime H. Sato M. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 519-524PubMed Google Scholar). Gene targeting studies have shown that VEGF, Flk1, and Flt1 are essential for fetal angiogenesis. The loss of even a single allele for VEGF is lethal, suggesting the unique importance of this angiogenic factor (23.Ferrara N. Carver Moore K. Chen H. Dowd M. Lu L. O'Shea K.S. Powell-Braxton L. Hillan K.J. Moore M.W. Nature. 1996; 380: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (3003) Google Scholar). Mouse embryos null for either receptor die in utero between days 8.5 and 9.5; however, the phenotypes of the receptor knock-out animals are distinct (24.Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar, 25.Fong G-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). In Flk1 null mutant mice, endothelial and hematopoietic cell development are impaired (24.Shalaby F. Rossant J. Yamaguchi T.P. Gertsenstein M. Wu X-F. Breitman M.L. Schuh A.C. Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar), whereas in Flt1 null mutant mice there is apparent overgrowth of endothelial cells, and blood vessels are disorganized (25.Fong G-H. Rossant J. Gertsenstein M. Breitman M.L. Nature. 1995; 376: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (2185) Google Scholar). The distinct phenotypes of the Flk1 and Flt1 knock-out animals show that these receptors have different biological functions, which makes it likely that KDR/Flk1 and Flt1 utilize distinct signal transduction cascades to promote responses. Flk1 is particularly abundant on the proliferating endothelial cells of vascular sprouts of embryonic and early postnatal brain; however, the level of Flk1 mRNA is dramatically reduced in adult brains in which endothelial cell proliferation has ceased (21.Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). These observations and experiments using mutant forms of VEGF that selectively bind KDR/Flk1 or Flt1 (26.Keyt B.A. Nguyen H.V. Berleau L.T. Duarte C.M. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) associate the former receptor with endothelial cell proliferation and survival. The ability of VEGF and PlGF, a VEGF homolog that binds Flt1 but not KDR/Flk1, to induce chemotaxis and procoagulant activity associates these responses with signaling through Flt1 (27.Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 213-221PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17629-17634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). These observations also support the conclusion that the functions of VEGF are segregated between two structurally related receptor tyrosine kinases. Previously, we demonstrated that VEGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of a group of signaling molecules that contain SH2 domains and associated this process with endothelial cell proliferation (30.Guo D. Jia Q. Song H-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, at that time it was not possible to determine which signaling proteins bound to or were activated by KDR/Flk1 or Flt1. The present study identifies PLCγ, Akt, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and PKCε as components of the signaling mechanism used by KDR to affect cellular responses. KDR also mediates activation of MAPK and promotes endothelial cell proliferation. Activation of PLCγ and PKCε by KDR occurred independently of one another and of PI 3-kinase. MAPK activation by VEGF was mediated by MEK, PLCγ, and PKCε but not by PI 3-kinase; however, only MEK was implicated in MAPK activation by EGF or basic FGF. Finally, MAPK activity was important to the induction of endothelial cell proliferation induced by VEGF, EGF, or FGF. However, PKC activity, acting through MAPK-dependent and MAPK-independent pathways was important to HUVEC proliferation induced by VEGF but not by FGF or EGF. Thus, in the endothelium, VEGF utilizes multiple signaling pathways not accessed by other mitogens to elicit responses. This may explain the pre-eminent role of VEGF in angiogenesis. Recombinant human VEGF and the cDNA for KDR were gifts from Genentech Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). PlGF was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). EGF and basic FGF were from Clonetics Inc. (San Diego, CA) and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. SU5416, a specific KDR antagonist, was a gift from Sugen Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antiphosphotyrosine antibody (RC20), monoclonal antibodies to PLCγ, FAK, and antibodies to PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCε were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-PKCζ was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Antibodies to phospho-MAPK, MAPK, phospho-Akt, Akt, and PD98059 were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). GF 109203X was from LC Laboratories (Boston, MA). Wortmannin was from Sigma Inc., and U73122 was from Calbiochem Inc. (San Diego, CA). HUVEC obtained as described previously (31.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar) were grown on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in endothelial cell growth medium (Clonetics, Inc.) in a humidified incubator under 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Subconfluent HUVEC were starved in endothelial cell basal medium (Clonetics) containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 16 h. Unless otherwise specified, for mitogen stimulation cells were treated with medium, or 50 ng/ml VEGF, PlGF, FGF, or EGF for 5 min at 37 °C. To test the effects of reagents on mitogen signaling, HUVEC were treated with 1 μm SU5416, 10 μm PD98059, 100 nm wortmannin, or 1 μm GF 109203X for 1 h or 10 μm U73122 for 10 min at 37 °C before treatment with medium or mitogens for 5 min at 37 °C. Assays were then conducted as described in the figure legends. Total RNA was isolated from HUVEC pooled from five donors using an RNeasy midi kit from Qiagen, Inc. The passage number of each population of HUVEC used for RNA isolation was <3. Poly(A)+ RNA was then isolated from the total RNA using an Oligotex Midi kit (Qiagen, Inc.). The HUVEC library was prepared byCLONTECH Inc. in pGAD10 for Matchmaker cDNA yeast two-hybrid library screening. Yeast strains for two-hybrid experiments were obtained from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA) as components of the Matchmaker Two-hybrid System. Strains SFY526 and Y190 were used to assay protein-protein interactions and for library screening, respectively. The intracellular domain of KDR spanning amino acids 788–1339 was polymerase chain reaction amplified using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into the SalI and ScaI sites of pGBT9 to produce pGBT-KDR-IC. For the PLCγ construct containing both SH2 domains (PLCγ-2SH2, amino acids 550–756), the SH2 domains were polymerase chain reaction amplified and subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGAD424. The N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of PLCγ (PLCγ-NSH2 and PLCγ-CSH2) corresponding to amino acids 550–657 and 668–756, respectively, were polymerase chain reaction amplified and subcloned into theBamHI and EcoRI sites of pGAD424. Two-hybrid assays using the GAL4 system were performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (CLONTECH). For library screening, Y190 yeast cells were transformed with a HUVEC two-hybrid library, and pGBT9-KDR-IC was used as bait. For characterizing interactions of KDR and PLCγ, KDR-IC, or KDR-IC point mutants in pGBT9 were cotransformed into the SFY526 yeast strain together with PLCγ truncation mutants. Transformants were plated onto Leu− and Trp−double-deficient plates. Colonies were picked, restreaked onto double minus plates, and assayed for the lacZ phenotype. Yeast transformants were grown on Whatman No. 1 filters for 1–2 days, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed on Whatman No. 1 filter paper soaked in 60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol containing 0.33 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside at 30 °C. Positive blue colonies appeared in 1 (strong interaction) to 6 h (weak interaction). Single point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of KDR were achieved using the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit developed by Stratagene Inc. (La Jolla, CA). Using the pGBT-KDR-IC construct as a template for mutagenesis, three tyrosine residues (Tyr951, Tyr996, and Tyr1175) were mutated to phenylalanine, thereby generating mutants Y951F, Y996F, and Y1175F, respectively. The amino acid substitutions were verified by DNA sequencing. After treatments, HUVEC were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline and lysed by incubation in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1.2% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mmsodium orthovanadate for 30 min at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitations, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting were then conducted as described previously (30.Guo D. Jia Q. Song H-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The redistribution of PKC isoforms was assayed by modification of the procedure of Lu et al. (32.Lu G. Morinelli T.A. Meier K.E. Rosenzweig S.A. Egan B.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 611-618Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, HUVEC were grown to 80% confluence in endothelial cell growth medium. The day of the experiment, the cells were incubated in endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h during which time they were treated with SU5416, U73122, or wortmannin at 37 °C as described above under “Cell Culture and Treatments” and then incubated in the absence or presence of VEGF. After the medium was aspirated, the cell monolayer was washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). A lysate prepared by repeated passage of the cells through a 25-gauge needle was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant represents the cytosolic cell fraction. The pellet was suspended in buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100 by vortexing three times for 30 s during a 30-min incubation on ice. The lysate was centrifuged in a table-top microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant contained the cell membrane fraction. HUVEC in endothelial cell growth medium were plated onto 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well. The next day the medium was changed to endothelial cell basal medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (starvation medium). The cells were then pretreated with various inhibitors for 1 h and incubated with various mitogens for 30 h. [3H]Thymidine (1 μCi) was added to each well during the last 6 h of incubation. [3H]Thymidine-labeled DNA, which corresponds to de novo DNA synthesis, was then assayed by harvesting the cells onto Whatman GF/B paper filter mats using a Brandel Harvester 96. The filters were assayed for 3H using a Beckman model LS6000IC liquid scintillation counter. To identify proteins that bind the intracellular domain of KDR (KDR-IC), a KDR-IC/GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion was created and used as bait to screen a HUVEC cDNA library cloned into the GAL4 activation domain. A total of 5,260,000 colonies were screened. From among 20 His+/lacZ+ colonies thus isolated, 6 were true positives. DNA sequence analysis and data bank searches revealed that 5 of the 6 positive clones encoded amino acid sequences in PLCγ. The largest of the clones (PLCγ-ΔSH3) encompassed nucleotides 1063–2404 of the PLCγ cDNA, corresponding to the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase X-box domain and both SH2 domains (Fig. 1 A). The specificity of the interaction between KDR-IC and PLCγ-ΔSH3 was confirmed by cotransformation of these constructs into the SFY526 yeast strain. As negative controls, pGBT9 (GAL4-BD) and Lam5′ (lamin) were tested for interaction with PLCγ-ΔSH3 and did not activate β-galactosidase. β-Galactosidase activity was detected only in yeast co-transformed with VA3 (p53) and TD1 (the SV40 large T antigen), a positive control known to interact, and the KDR-IC and PLCγ constructs (Fig. 1 B). These results confirm the interaction of KDR with PLCγ and rule out the possibility that PLCγ contains intrinsic transcriptional activity or nonspecifically interacts with other proteins. We considered it likely that activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR promotes its interaction with one or both of the SH2 domains in PLCγ. Tyrosines corresponding to amino acids 951, 996, 1054, and 1059 in KDR are phosphorylated in bacteria (33.Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and are likely targets for phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Among these tyrosines, Tyr951 is unique to KDR and in the kinase insert domain, whereas the other three tyrosines are in KDR and Flt1. The conserved tyrosine 996 is also in the kinase insert domain, whereas Tyr1054 and Tyr1059 are in the catalytic domain. Tyr1175 in the KDR C-terminal domain corresponds to tyrosine Tyr1169 of Flt1, a binding site for PLCγ (34.Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar,35.Cunningham S.A. Pia Arrate M. Brock T.A. Waxhm M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 635-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Given that Tyr951, Tyr996, and Tyr1175 are outside of the catalytic domain of KDR, these tyrosines were mutated to phenylalanine to yield KDRY951F, KDRY996F, and KDRY1175F. Testing of wild-type and KDR mutants for interaction with PLCγ-ΔSH3, PLCγ-2SH2, PLCγ-NSH2, and PLCγ-CSH2 in GAL4-AD revealed that tyrosine 951 was essential and that tyrosine 996 of KDR was nonessential for interaction. Mutation of tyrosine 1175 weakened interaction of SH2 domain constructs of PLCγ with KDR-IC, suggesting that it may be a secondary contact site between PLCγ and KDR. The PLCγ constructs illustrated in Fig. 1 A were evaluated for their role in the KDR interaction. Individually or together, the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of PLCγ interacted strongly with wild-type KDR. This result suggests that either SH2 domain may mediate interaction with tyrosine 951 in KDR. The ability of either SH2 domain to interact weakly with tyrosine 1175 is consistent with the conclusion that this site also fosters the KDR/PLCγ interaction. To determine whether KDR and PLCγ interact in vivo, KDR was immunoprecipitated from control and VEGF-treated HUVEC. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the proteins associate and VEGF stimulation increases the amount of interaction. Because increased tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is associated with an increase of its enzymatic activity, we examined whether activation of KDR promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. Thus, cells were incubated with vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide) or SU5416, a specific antagonist that blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of KDR (36.Strawn L.M. McMahon G. App H. Schreck R. Kuchler W.R. Longhi M.P. Hui T.H. Tang C. Levitski A. Gaxrit A. Chen I. Keri G. Orfi L. Risau W. Flamme I. Ullrich A. Hirth K.P. Shawver L.K. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3540-3545PubMed Google Scholar), and then with VEGF (Fig.3 A). Probing Western blots of KDR immunoprecipitates with an antibody to phosphotyrosine revealed that VEGF promoted the tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR and a second protein with mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identical to PLCγ; SU5416 antagonized the tyrosine phosphorylation of both KDR and the protein corresponding to PLCγ. The definitive demonstration that KDR activation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ is illustrated by the results shown in Fig. 3 B. In this experiment, cells were stimulated with VEGF or PlGF. The former mitogen binds KDR and Flt1, whereas the latter only binds Flt1 (27.Sawano A. Takahashi T. Yamaguchi S. Aonuma M. Shibuya M.

As shown in Fig.4, VEGF, but not PlGF, promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK, and this process is abrogated by SU5416. A similar approach, used in combination with an antibody that only recognizes phosphorylated (activated) Akt on Western blots, showed that VEGF but not PlGF activates this enzyme, and this was inhibited by SU5416 (Fig. 5). Thus, FAK and Akt are activated by signaling through KDR.Figure 5Phosphorylation of Akt by signaling through KDR.

Thus, HUVEC were pretreated with SU5416 and then incubated with VEGF, EGF, or basic FGF. By probing Western blots of PLCγ immunoprecipitates with an antibody directed against phosphotyrosine, we observed that VEGF but not EGF or FGF promotes the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ (Fig.6 A). The ability of SU5416 to abrogate VEGF stimulation of PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation identifies KDR as the receptor responsible for this process. Because PLCγ directly binds KDR, we considered it likely that other signaling molecules would not be required for its activation (tyrosine phosphorylation) by VEGF. This supposition was tested by treating HUVEC with wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, or GF 109203X, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C (37.Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E. Loriolle F. Duhamel L. Charon D. Kirilovsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15771-15781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then with VEGF. Neither reagent abrogated the ability of VEGF to promote tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ (Fig. 6 B). Because mitogens are activators of PKC, we assayed the ability of VEGF to promote translocation of isoforms of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane, an event associated with isoform activation. Although present in BAEC (38.Xia P. Aiello P. Ishii H. Jiang Z.Y. Park D.J. Robinson G.S. Takagi H. Newsome W.P. Jirousek M.R. King G.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), PKCβ was not detectable in HUVEC (data not shown). Furthermore, assays testing translocation of PKCα and PKCζ indicated that these were not activated by VEGF in HUVEC (data not shown). However, as illustrated in Fig.7 A, VEGF induced redistribution of PKCε in HUVEC, and this was blocked by SU5416. Thus, the PKCε isoform is activated by VEGF, and this is mediated by signaling through KDR. To determine whether VEGF-induced activation of PKCε is dependent on other signaling proteins, HUVEC were treated with U73122 (Fig.7 B), an inhibitor of phospholipase C (39.Tatrai A. Lee S.K. Stern P.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1224: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), or wortmannin (Fig. 7 C) and then with VEGF. Assay for translocation of PKCε showed that inhibition of PLC or PI 3-kinase did not abrogate the ability of VEGF to activate PKCε. Thus, activation of PLCγ and PKCε by VEGF occur independently of one another and of PI 3-kinase in HUVEC. An experiment employing an antibody that exclusively recognizes dually phosphorylated (activated) MAPKs (ERK1 and ERK2) was conducted to determine whether VEGF activates these enzymes and, if so, which VEGF receptor was responsible for the response. VEGF activates ERK1 and ERK2, and this effect was blocked by SU5416, demonstrating that K"

We demonstrate here that NOS-III, but neither NOS-I nor -II, is rapidly and strongly activated and phosphorylated on both Ser and Thr in the presence of cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGK II) and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK) in vitro. Phosphopeptide analysis by mass spectrometry identified Ser1177, as well as Ser633 which is situated in a recently defined CaM autoinhibitory domain within the flavin-binding region of human NOS-III. Phosphoamino acid analysis identified a putative phosphorylation site at Thr495 in the CaM-binding domain. Importantly, both cAK and cGK phosphorylation of NOS-IIIin vitro caused a highly reproducible partial (10–20%) NOS-III activation which was independent of Ca2+/CaM, and as much as a 4-fold increase in V max in the presence of Ca2+/CaM. cAK stimulation in intact endothelial cells also increased both Ca2+/CaM-independent and -dependent activation of NOS-III. These data collectively provide new evidence for cAK and cGK stimulation of both Ca2+/CaM-independent and -dependent NOS-III activity, and suggest possible cross-talk between the NO and prostaglandin I2 pathways and a positive feedback mechanism for NO/cGMP signaling.

To date, three genetically distinct NOS isoforms have been identified, originally isolated from cerebellum (nNOS, NOS-I), macrophages (iNOS, NOS-II), and endothelial cells (eNOS, NOS-III). All NOSs share an overall 50% amino acid sequence homology and have similar cofactor requirements. Each NOS monomer contains an N-terminal oxygenase domain with a binding site for the arginine as substrate, tetrahydrobiopterin, Ca2+/CaM, and zinc, as well as a C-terminal reductase domain with an autoinhibitory region, and one binding site each for FAD, FMN, and NADPH as electron donor (1.Sase K.

Only NOS-I and NOS-III, the constitutively expressed forms prominent in neurons, and skeletal muscle or endothelial cells, respectively, are activated by agonist-induced elevation of the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration with subsequent binding of Ca2+/CaM to NOS (5.Venema R.C.

In contrast, NOS-II is regulated predominantly at the transcriptional level by endotoxins and cytokines in macrophages, hepatocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (for review, see Ref. 6.Nathan C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2417-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar), and binds CaM with such high affinity that it is already maximally activated at the Ca2+ level of a resting cell (7.Ruan J.

Additional regulatory mechanisms which have been proposed to regulate NOS include autoinhibition, protein-protein interactions, subcellular localization, acylation, changes in substrate supply, phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 8.Michel T. Feron O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2146-2152Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar), and enzyme monomerization (9.Bömmel H.M. Reif A. Fröhlich L.G. Frey A. Hofmann H. Maecak D.M. Groehn V.

Interestingly, shear stress and isometric contraction have been shown to activate endothelial NOS-III synthase in a Ca2+/CaM-independent manner that is sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (11.Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Fisslthaler B. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 686-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 12.Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Schäfer A. Scholz D. Aldershvile J. Busse R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This Ca2+-independent activation is not understood molecularly. For example, a tyrosine kinase-dependent step has been suggested, however, shear stress-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-III could not be shown (13.Corson M.A. James N.L. Latta S.E. Nerem R.M. Berk B.C. Harrison D.G. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Alternatively, tyrosine kinase-dependent phosphorylation of yet unknown NOS-III-binding proteins was suggested to play a role in Ca2+-independent endothelial NO release (14.Ayajiki K. Kindermann M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Importantly, NOS-III has not been shown to have Ca2+independent activity in broken cell preparations or as a purified enzyme. Thus, the possibility remained that NOS-III is in fact Ca2+-dependent, but that membrane-localized increases in free Ca2+ undetectable by whole cell or multiple cell Ca2+ imaging (15.Etter E.F. Minta A. Poenie M. Fay F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5368-5373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), are important in enzyme regulation. NO formation triggers cGMP synthesis and cyclic nucleotide-dependent protein kinase activation. Thus we considered the possibility that NOS-III is positively regulated by direct phosphorylation and becomes Ca2+-independent upon Ser/Thr phosphorylation by cAMP- and cGMP- dependent protein kinases. NOS phosphorylation has been investigated in several studies, but the effects and physiological consequences are not completely understood. Purified NOS-I was shown to be phosphorylated by cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cAK, cGK), protein kinase C, and Ca2+/CaM kinase II, with each kinase phosphorylating a different Ser. In all cases, Ser phosphorylation resulted in an inhibition of NOS-I catalytic activity, suggesting a negative feedback regulation of neuronal NO formation (16.Bredt D.S. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10976-10981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Dinerman J.L. Steiner J.P. Dawson T.M. Dawson V. Snyder S.H. Neuropharmacol. 1994; 33: 1245-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In rat heart, NOS-III is phosphorylated on Ser1177 and stimulated by an AMP-activated protein kinase both in vitro and during ischemia (18.Chen Z.P. Mitchelhill K.I. Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Rodriguez-Crespo I. Witters L.A. Power P.R. de Montellano O. Kemp B.E. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In cultured endothelial cells, NOS-III is phosphorylated on Ser in response to bradykinin and then translocates to the cytosol (19.Michel T. Li G.K. Busconi L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6252-6256Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that NOS-III is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae, and it has been suggested that the caveolin·NOS-III complex undergoes cycles of dissociation (activates NOS-III) and re-association (inactivates NOS-III) which are modulated by increases and decreases in Ca2+, respectively (20.Garcia-Cardena G.

However, treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells with hydrogen peroxide increased tyrosine phosphorylation of NOS-III and inhibited its activity, but did not disturb its association with caveolin (22.Garcia-Cardena G.

In the present study, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of NOS-III by cGMP- and cAMP-dependent protein kinases not only stimulates Ca2+/CaM-dependent NOS-III activity, but also causes a Ca2+-independent partial activation of NOS-III both in vitro and in vivo that does not appear to involve enzyme translocation to the cytosol. l-[2,3,4,5-3H]Arginine hydrochloride and [γ-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Braunschweig, Germany), [32P]orthophosphate (HCl free) from NEN Life Science Products Inc., NADPH from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), reduced glutathione (GSH) from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Germany), endoproteinase Glu-C from Roche Diagnostic, (Mannheim, Germany), trypsin (sequencing grade) from Promega (Heidelberg, Germany), (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobiopterin from Dr. Schirks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland), FAD, FMN, l-arginine hydrochloride, phosphoamino acid standards, and CaM from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany), Sp-5,6-DCl-cBiMPS from Biolog (Bremen, Germany), ninhydrin and cellulose thin layer chromatography plates (20 × 20 cm) from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, M199 medium, and fetal calf serum from Life Technologies (Eggenstein, Germany), Protein A-Sepharose beads from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Freiburg, Germany), and NOS-III antibody from Transduction Laboratories (Hamburg, Germany). Iloprost was a kind gift of Schering Pharma (Berlin, Germany). cGK Iα and the catalytic (C) subunit of cAK type II were purified from bovine lung and bovine heart, respectively, as described earlier (23.Walter U. Miller P. Wilson F. Menkes D. Greengard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3757-3762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). cGK Iβ and cGK II were expressed in and purified from the baculovirus-Sf9 cell system (24.Pöhler D. Butt E. Meißner J.

All other chemicals, reagents, and solvents of the highest purity available were purchased from either Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) or Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Water was de-ionized to 18 MΩ (Milli-Q; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany). Unless otherwise indicated, all chemicals were dissolved in argon de-oxygenated water. Recombinant human NOS-I, -II, or -III were purified from Sf9 cells using affinity chromatography (2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose for NOS-II, or CaM-Sepharose for NOS-I and III) (9.Bömmel H.M. Reif A.

Biochem. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Specific NOS activities were (nmol/mg/min): 401 (hNOS-I), 125 (pNOS-I), 10 (partially purified hNOS-II), and 105 (hNOS-III). All NOS were stored at −80 °C in 50-μl aliquots containing 10% glycerol until the day of use. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically according to the method of Bradford (26.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard and a SpectraMax 340 Microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Protein purity was determined by densitometry of Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels using a flatbed scanner and NIH Image software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). NOS-III immunoreactive bands were examined by Western blot analysis using a NOS-III-specific antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. NOS-I, -II, and -III were incubated at 30 °C for the times indicated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and either C subunit of cAK or cGK (Iα, Iβ or II) and 5 μmcGMP. The reaction was started by the addition of 100 μmATP. In control experiments, heat-inactivated (10 min at 95 °C) cGK and C subunit were used. Catalytic activity of NOS was assayed under steady state conditions by the Ca2+/CaM-dependent conversion ofl-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline (25.Hofmann H. Schmidt H.H.H.W. Biochem. 1995; 34: 13443-13452Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) at 37 °C during a standard incubation period of 15 min. If not otherwise stated, reaction mixtures contained NOS (various amounts used are given in figure legends), 50 nm CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 250 μm CHAPSO, 7 mm reduced glutathione, 10 μm FAD, 5 μm FMN, 5 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 50 μml-arginine (containing 5.55 kBq ofl-[2,3,4,5-3H]arginine), and 1 mmNADPH, in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.2), and a total volume of 100 μl. For assaying NOS-III activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), arginine was reduced to 2 μm and tetrahydrobiopterin was increased to 10 μm. The l-citrulline formed was separated by cation exchange chromatography and measured by liquid scintillation counting. NOS activity was expressed either as a percentage of the maximum rate of l-citrulline formation (V max) in the presence of Ca2+/CaM, or as picomole or nanomole mg−1 min−1. For phosphoamino acid analysis,32P-phosphorylated NOS-III was digested in gel with trypsin (2:1, w/w) and then subjected to acid hydrolysis with 6 nHCl at 110 °C for 3 h in a sealed tube. The samples were dried, dissolved in water, and analyzed for phosphoamino acids by one-dimensional electrophoresis (Multiphor II, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on cellulose plates in 1.8% formic acid, 7.3% acetic acid (pH 1.9), at 1400 V, 15 °C for 2 h. Phosphoserine and phosphothreonine were used as internal standards and visualized by staining with ninhydrin. 32P-Labeled amino acids were visualized by autoradiography. Maximally 32P-phosphorylated NOS-III (20 pmol) was digested and the tryptic fragments were separated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a 0.3 × 150-mm PL-SAX (8 μm, 1000 Å) anion exchange column (LC Packings, Amsterdam Pharmacia Biotech, Netherlands). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 4 μl/min with a linear gradient from 95% solvent A (20 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0) to 99% solvent B (0.5m KH2PO4, 25% acetonitrile, pH 4.0) over 55 min. The eluate was monitored by UV absorbance at 214 nm and fractions of 4 μl were collected. Fractions containing radioactivity were further separated using a 300 μm × 250 mm (5 μm, 1000 Å) reversed phase C18 column (LC Packings, Amsterdam Pharmacia Biotech). Peptides were eluted at a flow rate of 16 μl/min with a complex gradient which started at 5% solvent B (0.08% trifluoroacetic acid, 84% acetonitrile) in solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) for 30 min, was increased to 50% solvent B at 120 min and 99% solvent B at 136 min, and ended with 99% solvent B at 146 min. The eluate was monitored by UV absorbance at 214 nm. Fractions containing 32P were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (Bruker Reflex III, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany) and Edman degradation (Procise cLC 494 system, Applied Biosystems), commonly using 0.3 μl of an HPLC fraction. As MALDI matrix, a saturated solution of 4-hydroxy-α-cinnamic acid (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile was used. Samples were mixed on target with the matrix solution. Purified human recombinant NOS-III (20 μg) was incubated as described above for the NOS activity assay after in vitro phosphorylation, except that in these experiments the concentration of l-arginine, tetrahydrobiopterin, and CaM were increased to 2 mm, 50 μm, and 2 μm, respectively. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 μl of ice-cold EGTA (30 mm) and the samples were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. After thawing, the samples were centrifuged (10,000 ×g, 4 °C for 10 min), and then a 100-μl aliquot (equivalent to 17 μg of NOS protein) was analyzed by fast protein liquid chromatography using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany) that was equilibrated with 20 mm triethanolamine buffer (pH 7.5) containing 150 mm NaCl and 5% (v/v) ethylene glycol. Proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min and monitored by their absorbance at 280 nm. Phospho- and dephospho-NOS-III were incubated at 37 °C with 4 m urea in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). The low molecular mass fraction, containing flavins that dissociated from NOS, was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 20 min) using filters with a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off (Ultrafree MC, Millipore). Samples were analyzed for NOS-associated flavins by reverse phase HPLC with fluorometric detection (λex = 460 nm, λem = 530 nm) on LiChroCart 250/4, LiChrospher 100 RP18 (5 μm) columns (Merck) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min (linear gradient from 100% 5 mm ammonium acetate (pH 6), and 0% acetonitrile at 0 min, to 83% ammonium acetate and 17% acetonitrile at 30 min (10.Reif A.

HUVEC (2 × 106 cells/25 cm2) were prepared as described previously (27.Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minick C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (6002) Google Scholar) and cultivated in M199 medium with 20% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin on 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks. All experiments were performed with subconfluent cells in passage 1. For phosphorylation and activation of NOS-III in intact HUVEC, cells were stimulated with 200 μm Sp-5,6-DCl-cBiMPS for 10 min, or with 100 μm of the prostaglandin I2 analog, Iloprost, for 5 min. Cells were then harvested in 25 mm triethylamine (pH 7.5), 7 mm GSH, 1 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm E-64, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and subsequently analyzed for NOS activity. The cpm obtained using extracts from untreated cells assayed in the absence of CaCl2 (presence of 1 mm EDTA) was defined as assay blank and subtracted from all values. Unless otherwise indicated, data shown represent mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's unpaired t test (two-tailed). p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The key sequence for substrate recognition by cAK and cGK contains basic amino acids N-terminal to the phospho-acceptor serine or threonine, with a more stringent requirement for multiple basic residues in the case of cGK recognition. Most consensus phosphorylation sequences for cAK and cGK are described by the motif R(R/K)X(S/T) and (R/K2–3)X(S/T), respectively (28.Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using this information, we identified several putative cAMP-and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites in human NOS forms I (Thr196, Ser631, Ser1002, and Thr1432) and III (Thr495 and Ser633). For NOS-II, no protein kinase recognition sequence motif was recognized. Fig.1 shows a multiple sequence alignment of selected NOS sequences. A comparison of human NOS-III with mouse and bovine NOS-III revealed that the two possible phosphorylation sites are conserved within the CaM-binding site (Thr495) and the CaM autoinhibitory sequence (Ser633). The putative phosphorylation sites of the NO synthases were further characterized by incubating purified recombinant NOS-I, -II, and -III with cGK Iα, Iβ, II, or catalytic subunit of cAK in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. An autoradiogram of a representative SDS-PAGE is shown in Fig.2 B. Only marginal incorporation of phosphate into NOS-I was observed after 5 min treatment with any of the four kinases. In contrast, VASP, a well known (control) substrate for cAK and cGK (29.Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was highly phosphorylated by all four kinases, similar in degree to NOS-III phosphorylation by cGK II and C subunit, described below (Fig. 2 B). To assess the activity of phosphorylated NOS, the conversion of [3H]arginine to citrulline was measured. Phosphorylation caused no obvious change in NOS-I activity (Fig. 2 A). Similar negative results (weak NOS-I phosphorylation and no change in enzyme activity) were also observed with two other recombinant NOS-I preparations, as well as a native preparation from porcine cerebellum (data not shown). In agreement with our consensus sequence analysis showing no putative cAK and cGK phosphorylation sites for NOS-II, no effect of any of the four kinases on phosphorylation (Fig.2 B) or activity (Fig. 2 A) of NOS-II could be detected. In contrast to NOS-I and NOS-II, endothelial NOS-III was strongly phosphorylated by cGK II and C subunit (Fig. 2 B), however, cGK Iα and Iβ showed much less 32P incorporation into the enzyme. Phosphorylation of NOS-III by cGK II and C subunit increased NOS activity 4–6-fold (Fig. 2 A), whereas no major change of NOS-III activity was observed after phosphorylation by cGK Iα and Iβ. The stoichiometry of NOS-III phosphorylation (Fig.2 C) revealed an incorporation of 0.82 ± 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of NOS by cGK II, and 0.76 ± 0.1 mol of phosphate/mol of NOS by C subunit. Half-maximal phosphorylation occurred at about 2 min. Further addition of kinases after 30 min did not increase phosphorylation, suggesting that the steady-state level of32P incorporation was not being underestimated due to time-dependent loss of protein kinase activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis of maximally32P-phosphorylated NOS-III by one-dimensional electrophoresis identified both serine and threonine as targets of cAK and cGK II (Fig.3 A). To directly identify the residues phosphorylated, purified NOS-III was incubated with C subunit or cGK II, digested with trypsin, and 32P-phosphorylated peptides were identified by HPLC followed by MALDI-MS. For both kinases, two phosphopeptides (amino acids 631–646 and 1173–1183) with phosphoserine at positions 633 and 1177, respectively, were identified (Fig. 3, B and C). The sequences and the phosphorylated serines determined by MALDI-MS were confirmed by direct Edman sequencing of the radioactive peptides (not shown). The phosphothreonine which had been detected by one-dimensional electrophoresis was not recovered. Tryptic digestion of NOS-III resulted in most likely too small a fragment (KpTFK) not retarded by the anion exchange HPLC. In addition, the presence of an intense matrix background, extending up to 1000 Da, would have made the detection of this small peptide very difficult. To circumvent these problems, phosphorylated NOS-III (up to 200 pmol) was digested with endoproteinase Glu-C to obtain a theoretical 35-mer peptide containing Thr495. However, the digest was incomplete (less than 10%), and no radioactive peptides were recovered. Since all NOS forms are only active as homodimers, we tested the effects of cGMP and cAMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation on NOS-III quaternary structure by size exclusion chromatography. Phosphorylated NOS-III was found to elute as two protein peaks, a main dimer peak at 13.8 ml of elution buffer and a second smaller monomer peak at 14.9 ml (Fig.4). Both peaks contained NOS-III immunoreactive protein as analyzed by Western blot (not shown). Neither cAMP- nor cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation altered the ratio of dimeric to monomeric enzyme (Fig. 4, Aand B), suggesting that changes in NOS-III catalytic activity resulting from phosphorylation are not due to changes in NOS-III quaternary structure or increased dimer stability. A potential effect of phosphorylation on flavin binding was investigated since two cGK and cAK consensus phosphorylation sites (Ser633 and the putative Thr495) in the autoinhibitory and CaM binding sequences are immediately flanked by FMN-binding domains (Fig. 1) (31.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.J. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). However, phosphorylation did not change the effect of increasing FMN concentration (0.1–10 μm) on NOS-III activity (Fig.5 A). In a second experiment, the amount of flavin bound to the phospho- and dephospho-form of NOS-III was examined by HPLC. No differences in the amount of NOS-associated FMN and FAD was observed after phosphorylation by C subunit (Fig. 5 B) or cGK II (data not shown). To determine the effect of phosphorylation on CaM binding, phosphorylated NOS-III was incubated with various CaM concentrations up to 1 μm. As shown in Fig.6 A, phosphorylation did not change the half-maximal concentration of CaM (15 nm) that activated NOS-III, but considerably increasedV max. Surprisingly, phosphorylated NOS-III was found to be active even under assay conditions in which Ca2+/CaM was omitted, although this NOS isoform is defined as being strictly dependent on CaM and physiological increases in free Ca2+. To further investigate this effect, NOS-III activity was examined either in the absence or presence of 100 nmCaM, in either the absence (0.5 mm EDTA) or presence of 1 mm Ca2+. When NOS-III was assayed in the absence or presence of Ca2+/CaM, both cGK II and C subunit activated NOS-III and caused a 10–20% fraction (Fig. 6, Band C, three left black columns) of the maximal Ca2+/CaM stimulated NOS-III activity (Fig. 6, Band C, open column), or 5–10% of the maximal activity attained by Ca2+/CaM in the presence of active kinases (Fig. 6, B and C, black column at far right) to become independent not only of Ca2+ but also of CaM. No activity was observed for nonphosphorylated NOS-III (denatured cGK II and C used) under the same Ca2+/CaM-free assay conditions (Fig. 6, B and C). As shown in Fig. 6, A-C, NOS-III activity in the presence of calmodulin (10–1000 nm) was also considerably enhanced by C subunit of cAK or cGK II. In order to investigate NOS phosphorylation and activity in intact cells, HUVEC were incubated either with 100 μm Iloprost, which activates adenylyl cyclase via a G-protein-coupled receptor to increase intracellular cAMP levels, or with 200 μm Sp-5,6-DCl-cBiMPS (not shown), a selective activator of cAK. NOS-III activity in the presence of Ca2+/CaM in the homogenate of cells that had been treated with Iloprost was significantly increased (138%, compare open columns in Fig.7 A). Moreover, a significant fraction (29%) of total NOS-III activity was Ca2+independent (black column in Fig. 7 A) in Iloprost-treated samples. These results correlated with those obtained upon co-incubation of purified NOS-III and cGK II or cAK in vitro. To investigate whether phosphorylation by cAK affected the subcellular distribution of NOS-III, we performed Western blot analysis of the 100,000 × g pellet (P100) and supernatant (S100) subcellular fractions of HUVEC. However, the membrane association of NOS-III remained unchanged (89% in untreated, 86% in Iloprost treated cells, Fig. 7 B). The present study establishes that endothelial NOS"

Under basal conditions, HSL resided predominantly in the cytosol and unphosphorylated perilipin upon the lipid droplet. Upon lipolytic stimulation of adipocytes isolated from young rats with the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, HSL translocated from the cytosol to the lipid droplet, but there was no movement of perilipin from the droplet to the cytosol; however, perilipin phosphorylation was observed. By contrast, upon lipolytic stimulation and perilipin phosphorylation in cells from more mature rats, there was no HSL translocation but a significant movement of perilipin away from the lipid droplet. Adipocytes from younger rats had markedly greater rates of lipolysis than those from the older rats. Thus high rates of lipolysis require translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet and translocation of HSL and perilipin can occur independently of each other. A loss of the ability to translocate HSL to the lipid droplet probably contributes to the diminished lipolytic response to catecholamines with age.

Although the rate-limiting step of lipolysis appears to be catalyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL),1 an enzyme that is acutely regulated by hormones that elevate cAMP and activate cAMP-dependent protein kinase (reviewed in Refs. 1.Yeaman S.J.

FEBS Lett. 1980; 111: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. It has now been shown that upon lipolytic stimulation of the fat cell, HSL protein translocates from a cytoplasmic compartment to the lipid droplet (5.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), and subsequent immunofluorescence studies using anti-HSL antibodies in 3T3-L1 adipocytes have demonstrated that HSL is distributed throughout the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells, but moves to the surface of lipid droplets in these cells upon lipolytic stimulation (6.Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Servetnick D.A. Schultz C.J. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition to the well established mechanism of cAMP-dependent activation of HSL, Okuda et al.(7.Okuda H. Yanagi I. Fujii S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1966; 59: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 8.Okuda H. Fujii S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 64: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) proposed the so-called “hormone-sensitive substrate theory” of lipolysis in which the hormone did not act on the lipase, but on the endogenous lipid substrate. Wise and Jungas (9.Wise L.S. Jungas R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2624-2627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) went on to propose a dual mechanism of lipolytic activation by catecholamines involving “substrate activation,” suggesting that some factor at the surface of intact lipid droplets may be necessary for the hormonal stimulation of lipolysis. More recent work would predict that this factor would be expected to facilitate the translocation of HSL, presumably by some alteration in the lipid droplet surface, and may involve the formation of smaller lipid droplets observed in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and Leydig cells (10.Barber T. Dwyer N.K. Levin D. Londos C. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 437AGoogle Scholar, 11.Fong T.H. Wang S.M. Lin H.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 63: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that differences in patterns of lipid droplet protein expression are partly responsible for the differing lipolytic response to catecholamines observed in adipocytes from different fat depots (12.Morimoto C. Tsujita T. Okuda H. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 132-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of one or more protein factors. One candidate protein for this role is perilipin, the predominant phosphoprotein in adipocytes. Perilipin is located at the lipid droplet surface, the presumed site of HSL action upon translocation to its triacylglycerol substrate (13.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Perilipin has been detected primarily in adipocytes and steroidogenic cells, in which lipid droplet hydrolysis is stimulated by cyclic AMP and mediated by HSL (14.Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Furthermore perilipin and HSL are concomitantly phosphorylated in response to lipolytic hormones in intact adipocytes and both are dephosphorylated in the presence of insulin (15.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18769-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Mooney R.A. Bordwell K.L. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), although different phosphatases may be involved (17.Clifford G.M. McCormick D.K.T. Londos C. Vernon R.J. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, tumor necrosis factor α was shown to increase lipolysis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes by a mechanism that involved a reduction in perilipin expression and also a redistribution of perilipin protein in the cell (18.Souza S.C. Yamamoto M.T. Franciosa M.D. Lien P. Greenberg A.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Furthermore overexpression of perilipins A and B in 3T3-L1 adipocytes blocked the ability of tumor necrosis factor α, but not isoproterenol (a β-adrenergic agonist), to increase lipolysis (19.Souza S.C. Moitoso de Vargas L. Yamamoto M.T. Lien P. Franciosa M.D. Moss L.G. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Thus it has been proposed that in nonstimulated cells perilipin may deter HSL interaction with the lipid droplet by forming a barrier around it, whereas cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated perilipin may somehow allow access of the enzyme to the droplet, perhaps by a modification of its surface (6.Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Servetnick D.A. Schultz C.J. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 611-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 18.Souza S.C. Yamamoto M.T. Franciosa M.D. Lien P. Greenberg A.S. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present study, we undertake the characterization of adipocyte HSL/perilipin translocation and the phosphorylation of perilipin in response to isoproterenol. We demonstrate that the stimulation of lipopolysis in adipocytes is closely paralleled by perilipin phosphorylation and that depending on the age of the rats, there is either translocation of HSL toward or perilipin away from the lipid droplet. Translocation of HSL to the droplet is associated with the greater lipolytic rates seen in young rats. [32P]Orthophosphate was purchased from ICN. The protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, and antipain were from the Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan. Collagenase was from Worthington, and orlistat (also called Zenical or tetrahydrolipstatin) was a kind gift from Hoffmann LaRoche, Basel, Switzerland. Anti-perilipin NH2-terminal antibody was raised in rabbits as described previously (14.Servetnick D.A. Brasaemle D.L. Gruia-Gray J. Kimmel A.R. Wolff J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16970-16973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), as was an antibody raised against rat HSL/bacterial fusion protein (20.Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 663-671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, United Kingdom). Male Wistar rats, >180 g, fed ad libitum on a diet of standard laboratory chow, were raised in house at the Comparative Biology Center at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Rats were used when they were either 6–8 weeks old (180–220 g body weight) or at 8–12 weeks (230–280 g body weight). Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of the epididymal fat pads (21.Rodbell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of male Wistar rats, starved overnight, and killed by cervical dislocation. Manipulations of adipocytes for 32P labeling were performed in reduced phosphate (50 μm KH2PO4) Krebs-Ringer, buffered with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mmMgCl2, 3% bovine serum albumin, and 2 mmglucose (reduced phosphate KRH). 200 nm adenosine was included to suppress cAMP production and stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity (22.Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.S. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15130-15138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All other manipulations of adipocytes were performed in standard Krebs-Ringer solution containing similar additions. Following isolation, cells were shaken at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed in bovine serum albumin-free buffer supplemented with 200 nm adenosine. The packed cell volume (PCV) of the final suspension was determined by aspirating small aliquots into capillary hematocrit tubes and centrifugation in a microhematocrit centrifuge. Aliquots (300 μl) of adipocytes at approximately 20% PCV were incubated for the indicated times in 2 ml wells of 48-well tissue culture plates at 37 °C, either under “basal” conditions,i.e. supplemented with 200 nm adenosine and 2 mm glucose only, or in the presence of the additions mentioned in the text. KRH buffer (150 μl) was then removed from below the floating cells for the assay of glycerol release, and the remaining cells lysed in 150 μl of ice-cold 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 225 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 mm NaF (buffer A). Following lysis, cells remained on ice for 15 min for the floating fatcake to solidify. The lysate was then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The cytosolic fraction was aspirated from below the solidified fatcake and 100 μl of cytosol added to an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The fatcake fraction was respun at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 15 min and any contaminating cytosol aspirated and discarded. The fatcake was warmed to room temperature, 100 μl of SDS sample buffer added, and the solution vortexed thoroughly. Following centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min, the fatcake protein extract was aspirated from below the floating fat layer for PAGE. Dilution factors and packed cell volumes from each experiment were taken into consideration to ensure equivalent loading (per ml of packed cells) of the two fractions on subsequent SDS-PAGE. Adipocytes (200 μl PCV/ml) were loaded with [32P]Pi, by incubating the cells in reduced phosphate KRH (bovine serum albumin-free) supplemented with 200 nm adenosine and 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h at 37 °C.32P-Labeled adipocytes were either incubated under “basal” conditions or lipolytically stimulated with the indicated concentration of isoproterenol for the required time. Cells were allowed to float to the surface, and the infranatant was aspirated. The remaining adipocytes were lysed with ice-cold buffer A containing 3% (v/v) Triton N-101. The lysate was then vortexed vigorously and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Solubilized protein extract was aspirated from under the solidified lipid fraction and diluted with an equal volume of 2× sample buffer for PAGE. SDS-PAGE was performed using a Tris/glycine buffer system with Hoeffer mini-gel apparatus (23.Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3010) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, protein samples subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% gels) were transferred onto polyvinylidine difluoride membranes, probed with anti-HSL or anti-perilipin antibodies, and the amount of immunoreactive protein determined by enhanced chemiluminescence reagents from Amersham, Bucks, UK. Phosphoproteins were visualized by exposure to Fujifilm. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn from medium of cells at 200 μl cells/ml PCV and added to 200 μl GPO-Trinder reagent (Sigma Diagnostics). This procedure was a modification of the method described in Ref. 24.McGowan M.W. Artiss J.D. Strandbergh D.R. Zak B. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 538-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar. Glycerol release is expressed as nanomoles glycerol ml−1 PCV min−1. The subcellular location of HSL was studied in adipocytes in the absence and presence of catecholamine to investigate its relationship with the stimulation of lipolysis. Cells were isolated, incubated with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, and the infranatant and fatcake fractions of cells analyzed for HSL content by Western blotting of SDS-PAGE separated proteins (Fig.1 A). Upon incubation with isoproterenol of adipocytes isolated from the epididymal fat pads of young Wistar rats weighing between 180 and 220 g, HSL was observed to translocate from the cytosolic fraction to the fatcake fraction in a dose-responsive manner (Fig. 1 B). Under basal conditions, approximately 40% of the immunoreactive HSL was recovered in the fatcake fraction. Using 1 μm isoproterenol to achieve maximal lipolysis (mean glycerol release = 170 nmol/ml cells/min), approximately 40% of the total HSL translocated to the fatcake fraction, with 80% of total HSL residing in the fatcake fraction after 5 min of stimulation. This isoproterenol-induced HSL translocation event correlated with stimulation of lipolysis, as estimated by glycerol release from the adipocytes (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, in a separate set of experiments in which 75% of the HSL was cytosolic under basal conditions, most of the HSL translocation in response to 1 μm isoproterenol, i.e. 50% of HSL translocating from cytosol to fatcake, occurred within the first 2 min of lipolytic stimulation, with the stimulation of lipolysis occurring over a similar time frame (Fig. 2). Correlation analysis of results from these and other experiments with young male rates (180–220 g body weight) showed a highly significant (p < 0.001) linear correlation between the rate of lipolysis and the proportion of HSL associated with the fatcake (not shown). Incubation of cells with orlistat, an inhibitor of HSL (25.Smith G.M. Garton A.J. Aitken A. Yeaman S.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 396: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), inhibited maximally stimulated lipolysis by up to 50% without any significant effect on HSL translocation, suggesting that the translocation is not dependent on the catalytic function of HSL. 2G.

Epididymal adipocytes from young male rats (180–220 g) were maintained under basal conditions or lipolytically stimulated in the presence of 1 μmisoproterenol. After the times indicated, samples were removed for measurement of glycerol release, the cells were lysed, and fatcake and cytosolic fractions prepared. Fractions were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-HSL antibodies. Densitometric analysis allowed a quantitative measurement of the localization of HSL.

Isoproterenol still stimulated lipolysis in these cells from older rats, but to a lesser extent (46 nmol/ml cells/min), than in cells from younger animals (170 nmol/ml cells/min) (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous reports (13.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18769-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), anti-perilipin NH2-terminal (anti-PAT) antibodies used in this study to identify perilipin were immunoreactive against a 65-kDa protein in adipocytes, corresponding to the predominant 65-kDa phosphoprotein in 32P-loaded adipocyte extracts (Fig.4), hereby referred to as perilipin. This corresponds to the polypeptide of estimated mass 62 kDa reported using slightly different electrophoretic conditions (13.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of adipocytes from young rats (180–220 g) with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation of perilipin in the extracts. This dose-responsive phosphorylation of perilipin was observable both by phosphoprotein analysis of perilipin in 32P-loaded extracts (Fig.5 A) and by a decrease in electrophoretic mobility from the 65-kDa perilipin band to a 65/67-kDa doublet upon Western blot analysis with anti-PAT antibodies (Fig.5 B). Perilipin phosphorylation occurred in a manner closely paralleling the dose-responsive stimulation of lipolysis in these cells (Fig. 1), with near-maximal phosphorylation being achieved with 100 nm isoproterenol. 32P-Loaded adipocytes were incubated with 1 μm isoproterenol to elicit a maximal lipolytic response, and samples were removed from incubations at various times after lipolytic stimulation for SDS-PAGE and phosphorimage analysis. Maximal phosphorylation of perilipin occurred almost completely within the first 2 min of incubation with isoproterenol (Fig. 5 C), again paralleling the stimulation of lipolysis in these cells (Fig.2). Thus, upon incubation with isoproterenol, the observed phosphorylation and shift in electrophoretic mobility of perilipin parallels the stimulation of lipolysis in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. To determine the subcellular localization of perilipin upon lipolytic stimulation, the distribution of perilipin was studied under different conditions. Under basal conditions perilipin was predominantly associated with the fatcake fraction from all cells studied. In cells isolated from young male rats (in which HSL translocates significantly upon lipolytic stimulation), perilipin remained tightly associated with the fatcake under all conditions studied. Even when cells were incubated with 1 μmisoproterenol for 5 min to give a maximal stimulation of lipolysis and a lipolytic rate 5-fold greater than under basal conditions, there was no significant alteration in the subcellular distribution of perilipin, with approximately 90% of the total perilipin remaining fatcake-associated (Fig. 3 A). Perilipin was undergoing multiple phosphorylation upon lipolytic stimulation in these cells as shown by the decrease in electrophoretic mobility (Fig.5 C). In contrast, in cells isolated from older male rats (230–280 g body weight) there was a significant redistribution of perilipin observable upon lipolytic stimulation (Fig. 3 B). Upon stimulation of these cells with increasing concentrations of isoproterenol, perilipin significantly translocated away from the fatcake fraction and into the cytosol in a dose-responsive manner (p < 0.05), with approximately 50% of the total perilipin relocating to the cytosol upon maximal lipolytic stimulation. This study demonstrates that the translocation of HSL in response to the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol closely parallels the stimulation of lipolysis in young male rats. Whereas HSL remained predominantly cytosolic in adipocytes under conditions of basal lipolysis, up to 80% of the total HSL protein localized with the lipid droplet upon lipolytic stimulation. Translocation of HSL in response to an adrenergic stimulus has been demonstrated previously in young rats (180–200 g) (5.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). By contrast, with adipocytes from older rats, no translocation of HSL was apparent, and furthermore, the maximum rate of lipolysis induced by isoproterenol was markedly lower than in cells from younger rats. Results for older rats emphasize that lipolytic stimulation is not due to HSL translocation alone. This study suggests that within the intact adipocyte, the phosphorylation state of perilipin at the lipid droplet surface, observable both by 32P-incorporation as in Ref. 15.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18769-18775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, and its shift in electrophoretic mobility, is under tight control by lipolytic hormones. If perilipin is involved in the regulation of lipolysis, it may constitute the factor that localizes HSL to its substrate. Although it has been proposed that the function of perilipin could be to directly anchor HSL to its substrate as a “docking” protein when phosphorylated (5.Egan J.J. Greenberg A.S. Chang M.K. Wek S.A. Moos Jr., M.C. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8537-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), the present work suggests that this is not the case, as within the relatively nonlipolytically responsive adipocytes from older rats, although fatcake-associated perilipin is multiply phosphorylated upon lipolytic stimulation, there is no significant translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet. Furthermore, attempts in this laboratory to co-immunoprecipitate HSL and perilipin offer no evidence of any interaction between these two proteins (not shown), nor does a yeast two-hybrid screen (26.Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). 3C. J. Schultz and C. Londos, unpublished results. Western blotting of adipocyte subcellular fractions with anti-perilipin antibodies show that under certain conditions, perilipin moves away from its location on the lipid droplet into the cytosolic fraction upon lipolytic stimulation, supporting a recent report demonstrating a similar redistribution of perilipin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (19.Souza S.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 24665-24669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 27.Londos C. Basaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Segrest J.P. Kimmel A.R. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). This translocation is unlikely to involve a conformational change that allows perilipin to become freely soluble in the cytosol as it is highly hydrophobic (13.Greenberg A.S. Egan J.J. Wek S.A. Garty N.B. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11341-11346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Rather it seems more likely that the phosphorylation of perilipin and/or some other mechanism is causing an alteration in the lipid droplet surface. Indeed, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (10.Barber T. Dwyer N.K. Levin D. Londos C. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 437AGoogle Scholar) and Leydig cells (28.Wang S.M. Fong T.H. Hsu S.Y. Chien C.L. Wu J.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 67: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), lipolytic stimulation is associated with the formation of many small lipid droplets from the surface of larger ones, and perilipin may be present on the surface of these smaller lipid droplets. Alternatively, the phosphorylation of perilipin or some other factor may cause an alteration at the lipid droplet surface, causing them to become more susceptible to disruption by fractionation procedures, resulting in the appearance of perilipin in the cytosolic fraction. However, it appears that the translocation of perilipin is not essential for the stimulation of lipolysis in all cells, as it is not observable in adipocytes from the young male rats in which translocation of HSL was apparent on stimulation with isoproterenol and which had the highest lipolytic rates. A decrease in catecholamine-induced lipolysis in rat adipocytes with age observed in this study has been previously reported (29.Giudicelli Y. Pecquery R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 90: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30.Gonzalez J. DeMartinis F.D. Exp. Ageing Res. 1978; 4: 455-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fasting for 24 h caused a much greater loss of adipocyte lipid in 6-week-old rats than in rats of 8–12 weeks of age (31.Gruen R. Kava R. Greenwood M.R.C. Metabolism. 1980; 29: 246-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for the decrease in lipolytic response of adipocytes with age have not been fully resolved, but do not appear to be due to changes in the ability to activate adenylate cyclase or to generate cAMP, suggesting a change downstream of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (32.Dax E.M. Partilla J.S. Gregerman R.I. J. Lipid Res. 1981; 22: 934-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A loss of the ability to translocate HSL to the lipid droplet may thus contribute to this diminished response to a lipolytic challenge. It is interesting to speculate that this may be due to changes at the surface of the lipid droplet, such as the loss of vimentin observed during droplet growth in 3T3–1 adipocytes (33.Blanchette-Mackie E.J. Dwyer N.K. Barber T. Coxey R.A. Takeda T. Rondinone C.M. Theodorakis J.L. Greenberg A.S. Londos C. J. Lipid. Res. 1995; 36: 1211-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, as rats mature there may be changes in the levels of proteins which interact with HSL such as adipocyte lipid-binding protein (26.Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), or lipotransin, which may localize HSL to the lipid droplet in a hormone-sensitive manner (34.Syu L.-J. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 109-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar)."

Its interaction with β-1,3-glucan initiates the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade, which is an important defense system in invertebrates of many species. We cloned the cDNA of the βGRP of the silkworm Bombyx mori. The βGRP mRNA transcript was constitutively expressed in the hemocytes, fat body, and epithelial cells of the naive silkworm. At the same time, a bacterial or yeast challenge was indicated to intensify the transcription. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with known sequences revealed that the βGRP contained a region (Thr264 to Pro386) displaying significant similarity to the catalytic regions of bacterial β-1,3-glucanases and much higher similarity to the glucanase-like regions of Gram-negative bacteria-binding proteins found in the silkworm B. moriand the mosquito Anopheles gambiae.

In mammals, the importance of the innate immune system is now appreciated even more than before because recent findings have revealed that it is essential to make the adaptive immune responses active (1.Medzhitov R. Janeway Jr., C.A. Cell. 1997; 91: 295-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar). Over the past several years, proteins belonging to the Rel family have been demonstrated to work in intracellular signaling for the activation of acute-phase protein genes in both mammals and insects (2.Hultmark D. Nature. 1994; 367: 116-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the extracellular signaling of the recognition of microbes as foreign, insects and mammals have also been shown to employ homologues. Toll, a receptor on the fat body (an organ equivalent to the vertebrate liver) of Drosophila (3.Lemaitre B. Nicolas E. Michaut L. Reichhart J.M. Hoffmann J.A. Cell. 1996; 86: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2998) Google Scholar), and Toll-like receptor 2 on peripheral blood leukocytes of humans (4.Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Janeway Jr., C.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 394-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (4439) Google Scholar) have been indicated to work in the transduction of extracellular signals. The peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)1 is another example where homologues have been demonstrated or suggested to take part in the extracellular recognition of foreignness in the innate immunity of both mammals and insects (5.Kang D. Liu G. Lundström A. Gelius E. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10078-10082Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 6.Ochiai M. Ashida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These common employments of homologues in the intracellular and extracellular signaling mechanisms indicate close links between innate immunity of mammals and insects. A variety of bacterial and fungal cell wall components including lipopolysaccharide, peptidoglycan, and β-1,3-glucan are collectively referred to as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (7.Janeway Jr., C.A. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1989; 54: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They are biologically active and elicit various innate immune reactions such as septic shock, cytokine synthesis, and acute-phase protein synthesis in both insects and mammals. In the innate immune mechanism, PAMPs are recognized by particular pattern-recognition proteins, which could be present on effector cell surfaces as receptors or as free-floating molecules in the plasma fraction. In insects, any receptor for PAMP has not been identified yet, but several of the free-floating pattern-recognition proteins have been identified. They are the β-1,3-glucan recognition protein (βGRP) (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PGRP (9.Yoshida H. Kinoshita K.

However, none of the mechanisms used for binding to particular patterns have been elucidated. The molecular mechanisms of the recognition of β-1,3-glucan as foreign have not been studied in detail at present. Although the receptors and recognition proteins have been indicated to be present in mammals (18.Wakshull E. Brunke-Reese D. Lindermuth J. Fisette L. Nathans R.S. Crowley J.J. Tufts J.C. Zimmerman J. Mackin W. Adams D.S. Immunopharmacology. 1999; 41: 89-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), they have not been isolated, and their molecular identities remain to be studied. In invertebrates, no receptor for β-1,3-glucan has been demonstrated either, but proteins with affinity for β-1,3-glucan have been isolated from the silkworm (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), crayfish (19.Duvic B. Söderhäll K. J. Biol.

Iwanaga A. Tokunaga F. Iwanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 892-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and some of their properties have been reported. All of these proteins have been reported to participate in triggering the proteolytic cascade for melanin formation or blood coagulation. However, their properties at the molecular level are quite different, and the binding domains for β-1,3-glucan have not been identified. Insect βGRP was originally identified as a component of the prophenoloxidase cascade of the silkworm Bombyx mori (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The βGRP has been shown to have a strong specific affinity for β-1,3-glucan. Binding of the βGRP with β-1,3-glucan initiates the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade. The binding of PGRP with peptidoglycan has also been shown to initiate the activation of the cascade (9.Yoshida H. Kinoshita K. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13854-13860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Besides PGRP and βGRP, the cascade is composed of serine protease zymogens, prophenoloxidase, and components yet to be discovered (22.Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman and Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). The cascade has often been thought to be an effector mechanism only for the production of melanin around foreign objects such as bacteria, fungi, and non-habitual endoparasites. However, it is now speculated to be a signaling mechanism by which recognition signals for fungi (β-1,3-glucan) and bacteria (peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide) are relayed to effector cells. Realizing the paucity of our understanding of the recognition mechanisms of β-1,3-glucan as foreign in innate immunity of invertebrates and mammals, we conducted experiments on the silkworm βGRP with the following aims: to establish the identity of the silkworm βGRP and to identify the binding domain of βGRP for β-1,3-glucan. We report here the cloning of βGRP cDNA from the cDNA library of the hemocytes of the silkworm B. mori. The sequence analysis showed that βGRP is a protein containing a glucanase-like region in the central part and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment site in the hydrophobic C-terminal portion. The glucanase-like region appears not to have affinity for β-1,3-glucan, but the N-terminal fragment with 102 amino acids was shown to bind strongly to the glucan. Silkworms, B. mori(strain Kinshu × Showa), were reared on an artificial diet as described previously (23.Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In the experiments for immune challenge of the insect, Enterobacter cloacae (JCM1232) and Candida albicans (JCM2078) were used. C. albicans was grown in a Potato-Dextrose broth medium (Difco) at 25 °C. At the late logarithmic phase of the growth, the cells were collected and suspended in 10 mm bis-tris propane buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The larvae on day 5 of the fifth instar were injected with 10 μl of the suspension at A 600= 0.1. The bacterial challenge was carried out as described previously (6.Ochiai M. Ashida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The βGRP was highly purified from the hemolymph of silkworm larvae on day 5 of the fifth instar as described previously (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 400 μg of the protein was incubated with 1.0 μg of α-chymotrypsin (Sigma, TLCK-treated type VII from bovine pancreas) in 1.4 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, at 37 °C for 30 min. This treatment caused a cleavage of βGRP into two fragments, which migrated to positions of 20- and 43-kDa proteins in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). After addition of 40 μl of 0.1 m phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in ethanol, the reaction mixture was diluted 6 times with 20 mmbis-tris propane buffer, pH 6.5, and immediately applied to a Mono Q column HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The adsorbed βGRP-derived 20- and 43-kDa fragments were separated at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with a liner gradient of NaCl from 50 to 250 mm in a total volume of 20 ml of 10 mm bis-tris propane buffer, pH 6.5. The 20- and 43-kDa fragments were eluted at 200 and 120 mmNaCl, respectively. Both the fragment solutions were individually dialyzed against 10 mm Tris maleate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. The dialyzed solutions were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used as the 20- and 43-kDa fragment solutions. SDS-PAGE was performed according to Laemmli's method (24.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) in 12.5% separating gel under reducing conditions. For the determination of the relative molecular mass in the SDS-PAGE, marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were run with samples. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Lowry et al. (25.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Curdlan has a nature to form gel by neutralization of its alkaline solution (26.Harada T. Misaki A. Saito H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 124: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The curdlan beads were prepared as follows: 60 ml of 3% (w/v) curdlan in 0.1 nNaOH solution was dropped at a flow rate of 60 ml/h into 240 ml of 1-butyl alcohol containing 0.5% (w/v) Tween 20 with vigorous stirring to disperse the curdlan solution. The dispersed solution was dropped to a mixture of 1-butyl alcohol (260 ml) and acetic acid (20 ml) with stirring to neutralization. After gelation of the curdlan, the beads were washed 5 times by decantation in 2 liters of distilled deionized water. About 15 ml of the aqueous slurry of beads was obtained, and the shape of the beads was spherical in diameters of 100–300 μm. The curdlan binding assay was carried out by essentially the same method as used before (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μl of the curdlan beads suspension was incubated with a sample solution (50–200 μl) for 10 min at room temperature. After the supernatant was removed by centrifugation at 800 × g for 1 min, the beads were suspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm bis-tris propane buffer, pH 6.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and centrifuged. The suspension and centrifugation was repeated three times. Protein adsorbed to the beads was eluted with 20 μl of SDS-PAGE solubilizing buffer (82 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, containing 1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 30% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) at boiling temperature for 5 min. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and quantified densitometrically using the Analytical Imaging Station software (Imaging Research Inc., Canada). It was confirmed that at least 280 μg of the purified βGRP could bind the beads, and the amount of the bound protein was quantitatively determined under the experimental conditions. For the determination of N-terminal amino acid sequences of the βGRP, 20- and 43-kDa fragments, the preparations were desalted on a Wakopak C4 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Wako Pure Chemical Industries) in high performance liquid chromatography. The isolated samples were analyzed by automated Edman degradation using a protein sequencer PPSQ-10 (Shimadzu Corp.). For obtaining the internal sequences of the 20- and 43-kDa fragments, theS-pyridylethylated fragments were digested separately with lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at a molar ratio of enzyme to substrate of 1:100. Each digest was fractionated by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a column of STR ODS-II PEEK (4.6 × 150 mm, Shimadzu Corp.). The peptides eluted as separated peaks were subjected to sequence analysis. Mass number analyses were performed using a Kompact matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometer (model IV, Shimadzu Corp.) in linear time of flight mode. A saturated sinapinic acid in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid was used as a matrix. The MALDI mass spectrometer was calibrated for the mass/H+value using horse heart myoglobin (M r 16,950.9) and bovine serum albumin (M r 66,525) as standards before use. The plasma fraction of hemolymph was prepared according to the method of Ashida (27.Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1981; 11: 57-65Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Mixtures of 5 μl of 100 μg/ml zymosan (a mixture of β-1,3-glucan and mannan) and 10 μl of 20- or 43-kDa fragment solution at various concentrations were preincubated at 25 °C for 30 min. Each of the mixtures was added to a mixture of 83 μl of plasma and 2 μl of 250 mm CaCl2, followed by incubation at 25 °C. At intervals, phenoloxidase activity of the mixtures at 25 °C was assayed spectrophotometrically as was described previously (23.Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In a control experiment, 100 μg/ml peptidoglycan from Micrococcus luteus was used instead of zymosan. Poly(A)+ RNA was extracted from the hemocytes of silkworm larvae on day 5 of the fifth instar using a Quick Prep Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A λgt10 cDNA library was constructed from the poly(A)+ RNA using a cDNA synthesis system and rapid cloning module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The library was used as a template in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A pair of degenerate oligonucleotide primers was synthesized on the basis of the internal sequences, NEEMEG and WFPTWD, respectively, of 20- and 43-kDa fragments: 5′-AAGAATTCAA(C/T)GA(A/G)GA(A/G)ATGGA(A/G)GG-3′ and 5′- AAGAATTCTC(A/G)TCCCA(A/C/G/T)GT(A/C/G/T)GG(A/G)AACCA-3′. The PCR was repeated for 40 cycles with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The product was digested with EcoRI, purified with agarose gel electrophoresis, and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a BcaBEST labeling kit (Takara Shuzo Co.) to prepare a probe for βGRP cDNA. In screening the λgt10 hemocyte cDNA library, hybridization was carried out at 65 °C for 16 h in 6× SSC (0.9 m NaCl, 90 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.2), 5× Denhardt's solution (0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Ficoll 400), 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC containing 0.5% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for 15 min and subjected to autoradiography. The insert DNA of the positive clones was subcloned into a BamHI site in the pBluescript II SK vector (Stratagene) and sequenced by a DNA sequencer (model 377, PE Applied Biosystems). The longest clone was used as the βGRP cDNA. A mixture (pH 6.5) of 50 μl of 2 mg/ml laminarin, 40 μl of 1 mg/ml βGRP, and 10 μl of 50 mm CaCl2 was incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. After the incubation, 5 μl of the mixture was analyzed by thin layer chromatography on a silica gel TLC aluminum sheet (Merck) using a mixture of n-propyl alcohol/acetic acid/H2O (3:3:2, v/v) as a developing solvent. The detection spray solution specific for reducing sugars was 10 mg/ml orcinol in 50% H2SO4. In a control experiment, Zymolyase-100T (Seikagaku Kogyo Co. LTD), β-1,3-glucan laminaripentaohydrolase from Arthrobacter luteus, was used as an enzyme with β-1,3-glucanase activity. To prepare various deletions in the N-terminal region of βGRP, cDNAs encoding the regions were amplified by PCR using the βGRP cDNA as a template. To add EcoRI andSalI sites to the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the PCR products, the primers were designed as follows: 5′-CGGAATTCTACGAGGCACCACCG-3′ (βG1-F); 5′-CGGAATTCGCAATACACCCTAAAGG-3′ (βG10-F); 5′-CGGAATTCGTTTCTGTTCCTGA-3′ (βG18-F); 5′-CGGAATTCAACGAGGAAATGGAAGG-3′ (βG35-F); 5′-CGGAATTCGGAGATAAGATTTACT-3′ (βG70-F); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCAGAGCTTACCGTGAAACG-3′ (βG34-R); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCAGATTTTCAGCGCTGCAT-3′ (βG69-R); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCAGTATCCTAAGCCGTCCT-3′ (βG86-R); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCATGTCCACTCCCCGTTAT-3′ (βG94-R); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCATTCAACTGTCCACTCCCCGTTAT-3′ (βG96-R); 5′-ACGGTCGACTCATACGAAACCTTCAACTG-3′ (βG99-R); ACGGTCGACTCAGGCTTCATCTACGAAAC-3′ (βG102-R); and ACGGTCGACTCATTCTACTCCTGGTGTTA-3′ (βG119-R). The PCR products were cleaved with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into the pET32a(+) vector (Novagen) which contains a sequence encoding the thioredoxin (Trx), a His tag, and an enterokinase cleavage site. After transformation of E. coli (strain, AD494(DE3) pLysS) by the vectors, the cultures were grown at 37 °C. WhenA 600 of the cultures reached 0.4, the expressions of the proteins coded by the vectors were induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to the final concentration of 1.0 mm. The cells were incubated at 30 °C with shaking for 3 h and collected by centrifugation. The cell pellets were suspended in 1/10 culture volume of 10 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, lysed by freezing and thawing, and centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 10 min. The supernatants were recovered for the curdlan binding assay and protein purification. The fusion proteins of Trx with the N-terminal region of βGRP were purified with a His-Bind resin according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Novagen). When the peptide containing the Trx and spacer was removed from the fusion proteins, the proteins were treated with enterokinase (Novagen) and purified by Mono Q column chromatography. Poly(A)+ RNA preparations from hemocytes, fat body, epidermal cells, midgut, silk gland, and Malpighian tubules of naive silkworms and total RNA from the fat body of the bacteria- or yeast-challenged silkworms were prepared as described previously (6.Ochiai M. Ashida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA preparations were run on 1% agarose gels, transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with a 32P-labeled βGRP cDNA probe at 65 °C for 16 h in the hybridization solution as described above. The membranes were washed twice with 2× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography. In the bacteria- or yeast-challenged experiments, 30-μg aliquots of the total RNA preparations were subjected to Northern blot analyses using cDNA probes of βGRP, cecropin B (0.4 kbp), and α-tubulin (1.3 kbp) as described previously (6.Ochiai M. Ashida A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11854-11858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The silkworm βGRP is sensitive to α-chymotrypsin. Digestion by the protease gave two major fragments. The mobilities of the fragments corresponded to the positions of 20- and 43-kDa polypeptides in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 1 A). These fragments were purified on Mono Q column chromatography and subjected to MALDI spectrometric analysis. The analysis revealed that the mass numbers of βGRP, the smaller, and larger polypeptides were 54,594, 13,338, and 41,313 Da, respectively (data not shown). The N-terminal sequences of these fragments and βGRP were analyzed as follows: βGRP, YEAPPATLEA; 20-kDa fragment, YEAPPATLEA; and 43-kDa fragment, TSTSLNPESP. These results indicate that α-chymotrypsin digested βGRP at a specific site under the experimental conditions and that the 20-kDa fragment originated from the N-terminal of βGRP. For preliminary experiments to clarify the binding domain of βGRP to β-1,3-glucan, the digestions of βGRP with α-chymotrypsin were subjected to the curdlan (insoluble β-1,3-glucan) binding assay. The 20-kDa fragment bound strongly to curdlan, but binding of the 43-kDa fragment to curdlan could not be detected (Fig. 1 B). The purified 20-kDa fragment also bound to curdlan. Any appreciable difference in the affinity for curdlan was not detectable between the 20-kDa fragment and the purified βGRP. These results indicate that the 20-kDa fragment originated from the N terminus of the βGRP and has the binding domain for β-1,3-glucan. Effects of 20- or 43-kDa fragments on the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade by β-1,3-glucan were investigated (Fig.2). When β-1,3-glucan preincubated with the purified 20-kDa fragment was added to the plasma fraction of the silkworm, the β-1,3-glucan could not activate the cascade until at least 100 min. On the other hand, peptidoglycan, another elicitor for the cascade, triggered the activation of the cascade even if it had been preincubated with the 20-kDa fragment. β-1,3-Glucan and peptidoglycan preincubated with the 43-kDa fragment retained their ability as elicitors for the cascade. These results suggest that the 20-kDa fragment bound to β-1,3-glucan prevented βGRP in the plasma from interacting with the glucan, resulting in the deprivation of elicitor activity of the preincubated β-1,3-glucan. A pair of oligonucleotide primers corresponding to the amino acid sequences of peptides derived from each of the 20- and 43-kDa fragments was used in the PCR. The reaction yielded a 1.3-kbp cDNA fragment that gave 1.0- and 0.3-kbp fragments in the digestion with EcoRI. By using the 1.0-kbp cDNA fragment as a probe for screening the cDNA library, 22 positive plaques were obtained. Among the cDNA clones in the plaques, the longest three clones were sequenced. The complete sequence of βGRP cDNA was determined and is shown in Fig.3 with the deduced amino acid sequence. This cDNA is composed of 1769 bp. An open reading frame of 1575 bp, nucleotides 123–1608, encoded a polypeptide consisting of 495 amino acid residues. The first N-terminal amino acid of the purified βGRP corresponded to the 17th amino acid from the beginning of the deduced sequence. Thus, the mature protein consists of 479 residues, which give rise to a polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 53,859.7 Da. The amino acid sequence contains a putative N-glycosylation site at the 362nd residue in the mature protein and a potential sequence of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment site (Ala455- Arg 456-Ser457) (28.Coyne K.E. Crisci A. Lublin D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6689-6693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the C-terminal hydrophobic region. The predicted amino acid sequence established here agrees well with the amino acid composition of the purified βGRP reported in a previous report (8.Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12056-12062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cleavage site by α-chymotrypsin was identified to be Phe119-Thr120. In the data base search, βGRP was revealed to show the highest sequence similarity to the GNBP of the silkworm B. mori(12.Lee W.J. Lee J.D. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7888-7893Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Both of the proteins have a glucanase-like domain of which the sequence is very similar to the catalytic domain of bacterial β-1,3-glucanases. Proteins with the glucanase-like domain were extracted from a data base. The sequences of the glucanase-like domains are aligned in Fig. 4 together with the putative catalytic domains of β-1,3-glucanases of bacteria (29.Yahata N. Watanabe T. Nakamura Y. Yamamoto Y.

All glucanase-like domains in Fig. 4 have been located in the central portion of the polypeptides except the one found in subunit α of factor G from the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus(33.Seki N.

https://openalex.org/W2074018262,"β-Catenin, a member of the Armadillo repeat protein family, binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, linking it via α-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton. A 30-amino acid region within the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, conserved among all classical cadherins, has been shown to be essential for β-catenin binding. This region harbors several putative casein kinase II (CKII) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation sites and is highly phosphorylated. Here we report that in vitro this region is indeed phosphorylated by CKII and GSK-3β, which results in an increased binding of β-catenin to E-cadherin. Additionally, in mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts expression of E-cadherin with mutations in putative CKII sites resulted in reduced cell-cell contacts. Thus, phosphorylation of the E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain by CKII and GSK-3β appears to modulate the affinity between β-catenin and E-cadherin, ultimately modifying the strength of cell-cell adhesion. β-Catenin, a member of the Armadillo repeat protein family, binds directly to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, linking it via α-catenin to the actin cytoskeleton.

Kemler R. Adv. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 28: 27-64Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is a type I transmembrane protein, making mostly homophilic cell-cell interactions via its extracellular domain, whereas the cytoplasmic domain is anchored to actin microfilaments via three cytoplasmic proteins α-, β-, and γ-catenin (plakoglobin) (2.Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 3.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). Another catenin p120 ctn is less tightly associated to E-cadherin, and its function is presently less well understood (4.Reynolds A.B. Daniel J.M. Mo Y.Y. Wu J. Zhang Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 328-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies on cultured cells as well as the use of recombinant proteins have provided a detailed picture of how the different E-cadherin-associated components interact (2.Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 3.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 5.Ozawa M.

Whereas β-catenin or plakoglobin bind directly to the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin, the linkage of the whole complex to the cytoskeleton is mediated by α-catenin, which binds to β-catenin or plakoglobin on one side and to actin on the other side (8.Knudsen K.A. Soler A.P. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 9.Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Plakoglobin, originally found as a major component of desmosomal junctions, and β-catenin form mutually exclusive complexes with E-cadherin, but the function of these two different complexes is not yet known (7.Nathke I.S. Hinck L. Swedlow J.R. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1341-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11.Butz S. Kemler R. FEBS Lett. 1994; 355: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both proteins belong to the so-called Arm-repeat protein family, a class of proteins characterized by a repeating motif originally identified in the product of the Drosophilasegment polarity gene armadillo (12.Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Armadillo, as well as β-catenin, have been shown to be part of the Wingless cascade inDrosophila (Wnt in vertebrates) (for review, see Ref.13.Willert K. Nusse R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Cell-cell adhesion is a rather dynamic process for which interactions between cell adhesion molecules and the cytoskeleton must be continually modified. Thus E-cadherin and especially catenins are major target sites for posttranslational modifications, primarily phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events. Tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin and plakoglobin decreases cell-cell adhesion (14.Matsuyoshi N. Hamaguchi M. Taniguchi S. Nagafuchi A. Tsukita S. Takeichi M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 703-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 15.Behrens J. Vakaet L. Friis R. Winterhager E. Vanroy F. Mareel M.M. Birchmeier W. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6166-6170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas ectopic expression of tyrosine phosphatases strengthens it (18.Müller T. Choidas A. Reichmann E. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10173-10183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), but the exact underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Even less is known about the serine/threonine kinases involved in phosphorylating catenins or E-cadherin. Treatment of human epidermal cells with okadaic acid disrupts cell-cell contacts and results in hyperphosphorylation of β-catenin (19.Serres M. Grangeasse C. Haftek M. Durocher Y. Duclos B. Schmitt D. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 231: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Serine/threonine phosphorylation of E-cadherin during pre- implantation development of the mouse embryo was also found to increase in the early eight-cell stage, and it was hypothesized that phosphorylation of E-cadherin is necessary for its redistribution during compaction (20.Sefton M. Johnson M.H. Clayton L. McConnell J.M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 44: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a previous study we have shown that phosphorylation of E-cadherin is concentrated to a short stretch of 30 aa1 in the cytoplasmic domain (21.Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This region is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with β-catenin or plakoglobin, and it harbors a cluster of 8 Ser residues. When all Ser were substituted by alanines, phosphorylation of E-cadherin in vivo was completely abolished. The lack of phosphorylation also prevented association between E-cadherin and β-catenin or plakoglobin. In fact, phosphorylation of two other binding partners of β-catenin, the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor protein and the DF3/MUC1 breast carcinoma associated antigen, was also shown to increase their in vitro binding affinity to β-catenin (22.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 23.Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y.Q. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Thus Ser/Thr phosphorylation may be a common mechanism to modulate the interaction between β-catenin and its binding partners, but little is known about the kinases involved. Therefore, we analyzed the phosphorylation of E-cadherin in more detail. Here we show that E-cadherin is phosphorylated in the Ser cluster by casein kinase II (CKII) and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β). Preventing this phosphorylation not only reduces the interaction between β-catenin and E-cadherin in vitro but also reduces E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in transfected mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Thus phosphorylation of E-cadherin appears to be a crucial mechanism by which cell-cell adhesion is modulated. NIH3T3 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. E-cadherin-expressing cells were generated by stable transfection of NIH3T3-lacZ and NIH3T3-Wnt-1 with the following expression plasmids: pcDNA3.1zeo-MMEC (musmusculus E- cadherin) and the substitution mutants S840A, S853A, S855A, and S853/855A in the same vector. NIH3T3-lacZ and NIH3T3-Wnt-1 cells were kindly provided by A. Kispert, MPI-IB, Freiburg, Germany. Stable clones were selected for resistance to 500 μg/ml Zeocin. The E-cadherin expression of several clones was analyzed by flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACScan using a monoclonal antibody against hE-cadherin and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibody (3.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). For further analysis clones with an equal amount of E-cadherin on the cell surface were used. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human E-cadherin and mouse β-catenin were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY) and the monoclonal anti-GST antibody from Sigma; 3000 mCi/ml γ-[32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Plasmids coding the E-cadherin Ser-Ala substitutions were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis using the pSK+UM (Uvomorulin, E-cadherin) plasmid as template (21.Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). pSK+UMS853A, pSK+UMS855A, and pSK+UMS853/855A were generated with the universal 3′-primer MECHindIII, 5′-GGTCGACGGTATCGATAAGC-3′, in combination with one of the following 5′-primers: MEC-S853A, 5′-AAGCCGCTAGCCTGAGCTCACTGAACTCCGCTGAGTCGGATCAGG-3′; MEC855A, 5′-AAGCCGCTAGCCTGAGCTCACTGAACTCCTCTGAGGCGGATCAGGACC-3′; and MEC-S853/855A, 5′-AAGCCGCTAGCCTGAGCTCACTGAACTCCGCTGAGGCGGATCAGGACC-3′.The pSK+UMS840A cloning fragment was amplified with the 5′-primer MECBstEII, 5′-AAAGACCAGGTGACCACGTTG-3′and the 3′-primer MECS840A, 5′-GCTCAGGCTAGCGGCTTCAGAACCAGCGCCCTCGTAATC-3′. For MECS853A, MECS855A and MECS853A/S855A, the PCR fragments and the pSK+UM vector were cut with NheI andHindIII and ligated. The MECS840A PCR product was cut withNheI and BstEII and ligated into pSK+UM, cleaved with the same enzymes. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For eukaryotic expression of the various E-cadherin mutants, the HindIII/BglII fragments of the described pSK+UM constructs were inserted into the respective sites of the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA). The expression plasmid pGEXUC1, coding for the cytoplasmic domain of murine E-cadherin (ECT, amino acids 580–728) fused to the C terminus of GST from pGEX2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), has been described (24.Marrs J.A. Napolitano E.W. Murphy-Erdosh C. Mays R.W. Reichardt L.F. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). pGEXUC1 was cut withBamHI/EcoRI, and the fragment coding for ECT was cloned into the respective sites of pGEX4T1. The region coding for the cytoplasmic part of the mutant E-cadherin was isolated from the pSK+UM vector, cleaved withClaI/XhoI, and ligated into theClaI/SalI-cut pGEX4T1-ECT to generate the following plasmids: pGEX4T1-ECTS840A, pGEX4T1-ECTS853A, pGEX4T1-ECTS855A, and pGEX4T1-ECTS853/855A. All cDNAs were expressed as ECT-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli. The recombinant glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-tagged cytoplasmic domain (ECT) of mouse E-cadherin and the E-cadherin substitution mutants were expressed inE. coli and affinity purified on glutathione S-transferase-agarose beads as described (25.Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μg of GST-ECT or the GST-ECT substitution mutants were immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (50% w/v) and washed in CKII kinase buffer (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5; 0.1 m MgCl2; 1 m KCl; 50 mm dithiothreitol) or GSK-3β kinase buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 0.1 mMgCl2; 50 mm dithiothreitol). The proteins were phosphorylated in a 50-μl reaction for 15–60 min at 30 °C with either 1 unit of casein kinase II (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or 0.1 unit of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (New England Biolabs), in the presence of 10 μCi of γ-[32P]ATP. To remove unincorporated radioactivity, the beads were washed in association buffer (0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS). Then the GST-ECT fusion proteins were eluted and separated on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radioactive gels were Coomassie Blue-stained and quantified with a BAS 1000 Bioimaging Analyzer (Fuji). Coomassie Blue staining was quantified using the NIH Imager program version 1.59. 2 μg of GST-ECT was immobilized as described above and washed in association buffer (0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS). For reconstitution of the protein complex 10 or 100 nm recombinant His-tagged full-length mouse β-catenin (26.Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

The beads bearing the complexes were washed and eluted for separation by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the phosphorylation-dependent association analysis, the GST-ECT fusion proteins were phosphorylated as described above before performing the binding reactions. NIH3T3-Wnt-1 cells stably transfected with either MMEC, MMECS840A, MMECS853A, MMECS855A or MMEC8531855A were lysed in CSK buffer (150 mm NaCl; 300 mm sucrose; 10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8; 3 mm MgCl2; 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100) and separated into detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min. For immunoprecipitation, the supernatant was precleared with 10% protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Approximately 2 μg of E-cadherin antibody was coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. The antigen-antibody complex was washed with CSK buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described (3.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1711-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells (6·106) were transiently transfected with 20 μg of either MMEC or MMECS853/855A. After 24 h the cells were grown for 2 h in phosphate-free medium followed by an incubation period of 16 h in the presence of 200 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were done as described. Western blots (25.Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were quantified by Lumi-Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). NIH3T3 fibroblasts or stably transfected NIH3T3 cells were seeded at a very low density (0.5 × 106/10-cm dish) and cultivated for 12–16 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed in PBS and trypsinized (0.01% (v/v) trypsin in HEPES-buffered saline) in the presence of 2 mmCaCl2 for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were resuspended in aggregation buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/PBS = 1:1 plus 5% heat inactivated fetal calf serum), washed, sedimented at 1000 × g for 3 min, and resuspended in the same buffer for counting. For adhesion assays on 1% agarose-covered 6-well dishes, 3–6 × 105 cells were incubated in 3 ml of aggregation buffer containing 5 μg/ml DNase I at a constant rotation of 70 rpm at 37 °C. At 0, 15, 30, and 45 min aggregates were randomly photographed at × 10 magnification with a computer-controlled digital C4880 camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) on an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Jena). Camera and microscope were controlled by the computer program Openlab (Improvision, Conventry, UK). Cell aggregation was quantified using the index (N 0 −N t)/N 0 (2.Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar).N 0 is the number of aggregates at time 0, andN t is the number of aggregates after timet. The average and standard deviation for three experiments are depicted in the graphical analysis. Previously we had shown that a 30-aa region within the mouse E-cadherin cytoplasmic domain (aa positions 833–862) is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with β-catenin (21.Stappert J. Kemler R. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). This region contains a cluster of eight Ser residues, which were highly phosphorylated in vivo. Consensus sequence analysis for various serine/threonine kinases indicated that Ser-840, -853, and -855 fit the classical consensus motif SXX(E/D) for casein kinase II (CKII), whereas Ser-849 basically fit the consensus motif SXXXS(P) for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) (Fig.1 A). The ability of CKII and GSK-3β to phosphorylate E-cadherin in vitro was tested on recombinant fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin (ECT) fused N-terminal to GST. Both kinases were able to phosphorylate the recombinant GST-ECT fusion protein (Fig. 1B, right panel, autoradiogram). Whereas CKII was able to phosphorylate GST-ECT directly, the phosphorylation of GST-ECT by GSK-3β was dependent on pre-phosphorylation by CKII. This finding is in agreement with previous results demonstrating that some target proteins of GSK-3β require pre-phosphorylation four residues C-terminal to the GSK-3β site by a distinct protein kinase (e.g. CKII or protein kinase A). GST alone was not phosphorylated by CKII or GSK-3β (Fig. 1 B, left panel). Upon phosphorylation, no apparent change in the mobility of the recombinant GST-ECT fusion protein was detectable by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie staining confirmed that equal amounts of GST-ECT protein were used in all assays (Fig. 1 B, Coomassie blue). To test whether E-cadherin can be phosphorylated by protein kinases from whole cell lysates of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, recombinant GST-ECT was incubated with the lysate in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiography. GST-ECT, but not GST, was strongly phosphorylated under these conditions (Fig. 1 C). To test whether this phosphorylation might be mediated by CKII or GSK-3β activity, the kinase assays were done in the presence of heparin, a specific inhibitor of CKII, or LiCl, which blocks GSK-3β activity (Fig.1 C). For both inhibitors we observed a strong reduction of the E-cadherin phosphorylation, indicating that CKII and GSK-3β are likely the major kinases involved in the phosphorylation of GST-ECT. However, a weak phosphorylation was still detectable even in the presence of both inhibitors, suggesting that additional kinases are also involved. The inhibition of CKII had a stronger effect on phosphorylation than the inhibition of GSK-3β, suggesting that phosphorylation of E-cadherin by GSK-3β may require pre-phosphorylation by CKII. The putative CKII and GSK-3β sites are located within the binding site of β-catenin in E-cadherin. As we have shown earlier, deletion of the entire 8 Ser cluster located here completely abolished the E-cadherin/β-catenin interaction, suggesting that this interaction may be modulated by phosphorylation. To test this directly, in vitro binding assays were performed with recombinant β-catenin and GST-ECT which was nonphosphorylated or pre-phosphorylated either with CKII alone or with CKII and GSK-3β together (Fig.2 A). For the binding analysis β-catenin was used at a concentration of 10 or 100 nm, both still in the non-saturating range (data not shown). GST-ECT-bound β-catenin was separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the relative amount of precipitated β-catenin was much higher when GST-ECT was phosphorylated. The amount of β-catenin bound to GST-ECT was increased by a factor of 4 if GST-ECT was pre-phosphorylated by CKII alone, and 6 times higher after phosphorylation by both CKII and GSK-3β (Fig. 2 B). To verify that in all assays equal amounts of GST-ECT had been used, the blots were also incubated with anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). These experiments clearly demonstrated that the interaction of β-catenin and ECT is much stronger if the cytoplasmic domain of E-cadherin is phosphorylated and suggest that this event may also be an important regulatory process in vivo. To demonstrate unequivocally that the Ser residues at aa positions 840, 853, and 855 of mature E-cadherin are in fact target sites for CKII, these three sites were substituted by Ala residues, either individually (S840A, S853A, and S855A) or pairwise (S853A/S855A). Since these mutations should also influence the phosphorylation of GST-ECT by GSK-3β, the putative GSK-3β site at Ser-849 was not mutated separately. Mutant proteins were subjected toin vitro kinase assays with CKII and analyzed as above (Fig.3, A and B). All mutants showed a clear reduction in phosphorylation. Phosphorylation was completely abolished in the single mutant S855A and the double mutant S853/855A, and phosphorylation in S840A and S853A mutants was reduced to 43 and 28% that of wt GST-ECT. The results demonstrate that all putative CKII sites located within the β-catenin-binding site of E-cadherin are used by CKII in vitro, and the observed differences in the residual phosphorylation of the three mutants may reflect differences in the preferences of CKII. Mutants were also subjected to in vitro kinase assays with GSK-3β, and phosphorylation was found to be drastically reduced (data not shown), in good agreement with the model that pre-phosphorylation by CKII at Ser-855 and/or Ser-853 of E-cadherin is required before GSK-3β can phosphorylate at Ser-849. To confirm the results obtained in vitro, human 293 cells were transiently transfected with wt E-cadherin or with the double mutant E-cadherin form S853A/S855A. The cells were radioactively labeled with orthophosphate and subjected to an E-cadherin immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3 C). Under these conditions, phosphorylation of the E-cadherin double mutant S853A/S855A was reduced by 25% as compared with wt E-cadherin. This is in the range of what can be expected since E-cadherin is also a putative target for other serine/threonine kinases, e.g. protein kinase C or cAMP-dependent kinases, which were not blocked in this assay. The results described so far indicate that the Ser residues at aa positions 853/855 of E-cadherin are the major CKII target sites and that CKII phosphorylation directly influences β-catenin/E-cadherin interaction, at least in vitro. To extend this analysis, E-cadherin-negative mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing Wnt-1 were stably transfected with either wt E-cadherin or with each of the mutant forms of E-cadherin. Fibroblasts expressing Wnt-1 were used mainly for two reasons. First, it has been reported that in theDrosophila clone 8 cell line, CKII activity is up-regulated upon Wg signaling (27.Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Second, expression of Wnt-1 was shown to increase cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion in AtT20 cells and PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (28.Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 29.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We therefore anticipated that the effects of CKII on E-cadherin/β-catenin interaction and cell-cell adhesion would be much more pronounced in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing Wnt-1. Immunoprecipitations were done on Wnt-1-positive NIH3T3 cells, stably transfected with wt E-cadherin or mutant E-cadherin. When precipitated complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against β-catenin and E-cadherin (Fig. 4), β-catenin was found to be strongly associated with E-cadherin. More importantly, the association between β-catenin and each of the four mutant E-cadherins was greatly reduced, with the double mutant form S853A/S855A showing the most striking effect. Hence, substitution of the two CKII sites Ser-853 and Ser-855 leads to a drop in the β-catenin/E-cadherin interaction not only in vitro but also in live cells. As a direct consequence of this reduced interaction between E-cadherin and β-catenin in vivo, the E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion should be diminished as well. The effect on cell-cell adhesion was tested by examining wt E-cadherin or S853A/S855A double mutant E-cadherin-expressing Wnt-1 NIH3T3 fibroblasts in a cell-cell adhesion assay (Fig. 5). Expression of wt E-cadherin led to an increase in cell-cell adhesion (squares), whereas the adhesion of mutant E-cadherin-expressing E-cadherin was significantly reduced (triangles). The relatively strong adhesion already observed in E-cadherin-negative Wnt-1-expressing NIH3T3 fibroblasts is presumably due to the presence of N-cadherin in those cells, since basal cell adhesion of NIH3T3 Wnt-1-negative cells was much lower. Nonetheless, cell adhesion was increased when these cells were transfected with wt E-cadherin and reduced if they were transfected with mutated E-cadherin (data not shown). In summary, the expression of the E-cadherin double mutant S853A/S555A in NIH3T3 cells not only reduces the interaction with β-catenin but prevents cell-cell adhesion as well.Figure 5Expression of the E-cadherin double mutant S853A/S855A in NIH3T3 cells expressing Wnt-1 reduces cell-cell adhesion. Cell adhesion assay of Wnt-1 NIH3T3 cells either untransfected or stably expressing wt or mutant E-cadherin. 3–6 × 105 cells were incubated for the given time at 37 °C. Expression of the double mutant S853A/S855A in NIH3T3 cells leads to a clear reduction of E-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Taken together, from the data presented here and from interaction studies of other binding partners for β-catenin, it seems evident that Ser/Thr phosphorylation is a common mechanism by which the binding to β-catenin is modulated. The clustering of serines within the binding region for β-catenin seems to be a characteristic feature for at least some interaction partners of β-catenin. For example, a phosphorylation-dependent binding of β-catenin was also found for two other binding partners, the tumor suppressor protein APC and the DF3/MUC1 breast carcinoma-associated antigen (22.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar, 23.Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y.Q. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). APC plays a central role in the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of β-catenin and has been shown to become phosphorylated by GSK-3β upon Wnt signaling (30.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3517) Google Scholar). The APC protein contains several binding sites for β-catenin. Those sites, necessary for the degradation of β-catenin, were found to bind β-catenin much more strongly if pre-phosphorylated by GSK-3β in vitro (22.Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1310) Google Scholar). The β-catenin-binding sites of APC and DF3/MUC1 contain the Ser motif SXXXXXSSL, which closely resembles the sequence SXXXXXSSE of E-cadherin, which harbors the CKII phosphorylation site 853. The serines localized in the β-catenin-binding site of E-cadherin and mutated here are conserved among all classical cadherins, supporting the idea that these residues play an essential role for β-catenin binding. The participation of CKII in regulating E-cadherin/β-catenin interaction may be deduced from the increased cell adhesion observed in Wnt-1-transfected ATt20 and PC12 cells (28.Hinck L. Nelson W.J. Papkoff J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 729-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 29.Bradley R.S. Cowin P. Brown A.M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Considering that CKII activity was found to be increased in Drosophila cells receiving a Wg signal (27.Willert K. Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), CKII activity may also be enhanced in Wnt-1-expressing mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts, thereby strengthening cell adhesion. Another hint that phosphorylation may be in fact a general mechanism to modulate the interaction between β-catenin and its binding partners comes from the crystal structure analysis of the central repeat region of β-catenin (31.Huber O. Krohn M. Kemler R. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1759-1765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core region of β-catenin is composed of 12 copies of the 42-amino acid Armadillo repeat motif. Through these repeats, β-catenin interacts with E-cadherin and APC (32.Hulsken J. Birchmeier W. Behrens J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 2061-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of this region was found to form a superhelix of helices that features a long, positively charged groove. From this it was hypothesized that proteins with acidic regions could interact with the basic groove of β-catenin. In fact the β-catenin-binding region is highly acidic in E-cadherin, APC, and LEF-1 (a DNA binding factor of the high mobility group box protein family). As mentioned before, phosphorylation of APC by GSK-3β was found to increase the interaction between APC and β-catenin, and it was concluded that interaction between β-catenin and its binding partner, in this case APC, would be enhanced by the phosphorylation of the β-catenin-binding region, which would make this region even more acidic. The increased binding to β-catenin upon phosphorylation of E-cadherin presented here confirms this conclusion. The biological significance of our results is also underlined by an E-cadherin mutant identified in a human ovarian tumor (33.Risinger J.I. Berchuck A. Kohler M.F. Boyd J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 7: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Here the Ser at aa position 838 of human E-cadherin, which corresponds to Ser 840 of mouse E-cadherin, has been replaced by Ala due to an A to G transition. Thus, phosphorylation of the β-catenin-binding region of E-cadherin by CKII and/or GSK-3β appears to be an essential mechanism to modify cell-cell adhesion.

Our results of the expression pattern of core binding factor α1 (Cbfa1), which binds to the runt domain site, indicated that there is no change in the levels of Cbfa1 protein or RNA under either control conditions or after PTH treatment. The importance of posttranslational modification of Cbfa1 in the signaling pathway for PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity was analyzed. PTH stimulation of collagenase-3 promoter activity was completely abrogated by protein kinase A (PKA) inhibition. To determine the role of PKA activity with respect to Cbfa1 activation (in addition to its known activity of phosphorylating cAMP-response element-binding protein to enhancec-fos promoter activity), we utilized the heterologous Gal4 transcription system. PTH stimulated the transactivation of activation domain-3 in Cbfa1 through the PKA site. In vitrophosphorylation studies indicated that the PKA site in the wild type activation domain-3 is a substrate for phosphorylation by PKA.

Cbfa1 is a key transcription factor in bone cells, and the activity of runt proteins is required for completion of osteoblast differentiation (25.Banerjee C. McCabe L.R. Choi J.Y. Hiebert S.W.

Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32988-32994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The expression of Cbfa1 is also controlled by Smad2, an essential intracellular component for the signal transduction of transforming growth factor-β in osteoblastic cells (28.Li J. Tsuji K.

Earlier, we demonstrated that only the level of c-Fos and c-Jun, not Cbfa1, is increased by PTH, and even in the presence of c-Fos, c-Jun, and Cbfa1, collagenase-3 promoter activity is strongly increased by PTH treatment (15.Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a posttranslational modification of Cbfa1 may be required for PTH induction of the collagenase-3 gene through Cbfa1 activity. To understand the Cbfa1 regulation in PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity, we analyzed its expression by Western blot and Northern blot analyses. We dissected the signaling pathway involved for PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity using ERK, PKC, and PKA inhibitors. Furthermore, the posttranslational modification of Cbfa1 was determined using the heterologous Gal4 transcription system. Cbfa1 was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by PKA. Our results provide evidence of PKA-dependent Cbfa1 transactivation, specifically as required for PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity in UMR cells.RESULTSRecent work in this laboratory has identified two elements, namely the AP-1 and RD sites, as required for collagenase-3 promoter activity in response to PTH in the rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cell line UMR 106-01 (15.Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). We have also shown that there is an increased amount of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins binding to the AP-1 site in response to PTH, but there is no change in the abundance of Cbfa (AML) binding to the RD site. Three isoforms of Cbfa1 have been identified that differ in their N-terminal sequence (30.Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene. 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To identify whether there is a change in the levels of Cbfa1 isomeric forms by PTH, total cellular lysates from control and PTH-treated UMR cells were isolated and used for Western blot analysis. Both control and PTH-treated lysates contained a major protein of ∼45 kDa that was recognized by an affinity-purified antibody made against Cbfa1 (anti-human AML-3 raised against a C-terminal peptide) (Fig. 1 A). In addition, we have also found a minor protein of ∼35 kDa. Since there was no change in the abundance of the Cbfa1 isoforms during PTH treatment, the possibility exists that either different Cbfa1 isoforms of the same mass are expressed or, more likely, that Cbfa1 is posttranslationally modified. The expression pattern of Cbfa1 transcripts in control and PTH-treated UMR cells was identified by Northern blot analysis using a mouse Cbfa1-specific riboprobe. This riboprobe hybridized to three transcripts (6.5, 5.4, and 3.2 kilobases) in either control or PTH-treated UMR cells (Fig. 1 B). There was no change in the level of Cbfa1 RNA in either control or PTH-treated conditions. The RNA loading and efficiency of transfer were verified by reprobing the blot with β-actin cDNA. That there was no change in the levels of Cbfa1 RNA or protein in UMR cells under either control conditions or after PTH treatment (Fig. 1, Aand B) suggests that PTH regulates Cbfa1 posttranslationally.Earlier, we showed that PTH phosphorylates CREB, resulting in activation of the c-fos promoter (31.Pearman A.T. Chou W.Y. Bergman K.D. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25715-25721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, we also reported that the PTH-induced phosphorylation of CREB is mediated by the PKA pathway (32.Tyson D.R. Swarthout J.T. Partridge N.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 1255-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Identifying the PTH signaling pathway for collagenase-3 promoter activity would provide insight into a possible posttranslational modification of Cbfa1. Hence, to identify the signaling pathway involved for PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity, we used PKA, PKC, and ERK pathway inhibitors. The collagenase-3 promoter construct (−148 C'ase-3) was transiently transfected into UMR cells. The cells were then pretreated with PD98059 (ERK pathway inhibitor) or GF109203X (PKC inhibitor) for 20 min, then treated with or without PTH (10−8m) for 24 h. Lysates were then assayed for CAT activity (Fig.2). The CAT activity was not affected by these inhibitors, suggesting that the ERK and PKC, signaling pathways are not involved in the PTH stimulation of collagenase-3 promoter activity. When we used H-89 (PKA inhibitor), PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity was inhibited (Fig.3 A). In addition, we have also transfected PKI, the heat-stable inhibitor of PKA (Fig. 3 B), and the result clearly indicated that PTH stimulation of collagenase-3 promoter activity was abrogated by PKA inhibition. Hence, PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity is mediated by the PKA pathway.Figure 2Effect of ERK pathway or PKC inhibitors on collagenase-3 promoter activity. The collagenase-3 promoter construct (−148 C'ase-3) was transiently transfected into UMR cells and then treated with either PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) (A) or GF109203X (PKC inhibitor) (B) for 20 min. This was followed by incubation in control or PTH (10−8m)-containing media for 24 h and assessment of CAT activity.

A region of 135 amino acids within the proline-, serine-, threonine-rich domain of Cbfa1, C-terminal to the DNA binding domain (runt), called AD3, is required for transactivation (29.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike AD1 and AD2, AD3 can function in a heterologous system (29.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it contains consensus phosphorylation sites for PKA, PKC, casein kinase II, and ERK. Since the collagenase-3 promoter activity was ablated by inhibition of PKA, and not by PKC or ERK inhibitors, we concentrated on the role of PKA activity on Cbfa1 transactivation. To examine the role of PKA in the transactivation of Cbfa1, we generated Gal4 AD3 and the PKA site mutant Gal4 AD3 expression vectors. These constructs were transiently cotransfected into UMR cells with an expression construct coding for the PKA catalytic subunit as well as a luciferase reporter gene containing Gal4 binding sites (Fig. 4 A). The wild type AD3 construct demonstrated enhanced luciferase activity when the vector for PKA was cotransfected, indicating that the PKA site in the wild type AD3 construct is functional and mediates the AD3 transactivation. To determine the PTH-stimulated AD3 transactivation, the wild type AD3 construct was transiently transfected into UMR cells and then treated with control or PTH (10−8m)-containing media (Fig. 4 B). The AD3 of Cbfa1 had enhanced luciferase activity when the cells were treated with PTH, whereas cotransfection with PKI, a dominant inhibitor of PKA, inhibited the PTH-induced activity. These results show that the transactivation of AD3 by PTH is mediated by the PKA signaling pathway. When the PKA site mutant AD3 construct was transfected into UMR cells, no PTH-induced luciferase activity was detected (Fig. 4 C). This further supports the previous data that the PTH-induced transactivation of AD3 in Cbfa1 is mediated by PKA.Figure 4Transactivation of Cbfa1 by PKA.A, The Gal4 AD3 wild type (W) and PKA site mutant (M) constructs were transiently transfected into UMR cells with an expression vector for the PKA catalytic subunit as well as a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene driven by five copies of the Gal4 upstream activation sequence and the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter. The cells were incubated for 6 h and assayed for luciferase activity. B, the Gal4 AD3 wild type (W) construct alone or together with PKI (50 ng) and the reporter plasmid were transiently transfected into UMR cells and then treated with control or PTH (10−8m)-containing media for 6 h. Lysates were then assayed for luciferase activity. C, the Gal4 AD3 wild type (W) and PKA site mutant (M) constructs were transiently transfected into UMR cells with the reporter plasmid, then treated with control or PTH (10−8m)-containing media for 6 h and assayed for luciferase activity.

The purified AD3 proteins were subjected to in vitrophosphorylation by PKA (Fig.5 A). The recombinant wild type AD3 was phosphorylated by PKA, whereas mutation of the PKA site abolished phosphorylation of AD3 by PKA. Autophosphorylation of PKA was also observed by incubating PKA in phosphorylation buffer without substrate (AD3). The purified recombinant AD3 proteins contain an S tag. Western blot analysis with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-S-tag protein was used to verify that equal amounts of the wild type and PKA mutant AD3 were present in the phosphorylation reaction (Fig. 5 B). These results indicated that PKA can phosphorylate the wild type AD3, and this is mediated by the identified PKA site. Thus, the PKA phosphorylation site within AD3 is the likely site for PKA-mediated transactivation of Cbfa1.Figure 5Phosphorylation of Cbfa1 by PKA. The purified recombinant wild type (W) and PKA mutant (M) AD3 of Cbfa1 were incubated with increasing concentrations of the catalytic subunit of PKA (0, 1, 2, and 4 units) for 15 min at 37 °C. A control sample without substrate (AD3) but with PKA (4 units) was included. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was first exposed to autoradiography (A) and then analyzed by Western blot (B) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-S-tag protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONPrevious studies from our laboratory showed enhanced binding of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins at the AP-1 site upon treatment with PTH. However, there was no significant change in the level of Cbfa1 binding to the RD site (15.Selvamurugan N. Chou W.Y. Pearman A.T. Pulumati M.R. Partridge N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10647-10657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By Western and Northern blot analyses, we show here that there is no change in the levels of Cbfa1 RNA or protein in UMR cells under either control condition or after PTH treatment (Fig.1, A and B). The presence of three Cbfa1 transcripts in the UMR cells (Fig. 1 B) could be due to the difference in their N-terminal sequences or the alternative splicing, which leads to selective loss of exons. Several isoforms of Cbfa1 have been identified by differential promoter usage or differential splicing (30.Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene. 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Merriman et al. (19.Merriman H.L. van Wijnen A.J. Hiebert S. Bidwell J.P. Fey E. Lian J. Stein J. Stein G.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13125-13132Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) report the presence of two transcripts in ROS 17/2.8. By Western blot, we found a minor protein of ∼35 kDa in addition to the predominant ∼45 kDa band showing that Cbfa1 antibody (anti-human AML-3 raised against a C-terminal peptide) will cross-react with other Cbfa1 isomeric forms having different N-terminal amino acid sequences (30.Xiao Z.S. Thomas R. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. Gene. 1998; 214: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, investigation of the functional differences of the three Cbfa1 isoforms (26.Ducy P.

In our studies, no change in the levels of Cbfa1 RNA or protein in UMR cells either in control or PTH-treated cells suggests posttranslational modification of Cbfa1 in response to PTH. It cannot be ruled out that different activities of isomeric forms of transcription factors generated by alternative splicing may result from different interaction with cofactors (36.Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). It is also possible that PTH regulates Groucho/TLE2, a repressor protein (29.Thirunavukkarasu K. Mahajan M. McLarren K.W. Stifani S. Karsenty G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4197-4208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in the alteration of Cbfa1 transactivation. The posttranscriptional regulation of Cbfa1 for TRI promoter activity in glucocorticoid-treated bone cells has also been proposed (37.Chang D.J. Ji C. Kim K.K. Casinghino S. McCarthy T.L. Centrella M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4892-4896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) but does not appear to be a factor here since there are no changes in mRNA or protein for Cbfa1.PTH binds to the PTH/PTH-related protein receptor on osteoblastic cells and generates multiple second messengers including cAMP (which activates PKA), diacylglycerol (which activates PKC), inositol trisphosphate, and increased levels of intracellular calcium (38.Fujimori A.

The transient transfection experiments of collagenase-3 promoter with PKA, PKC, and ERK inhibitors in UMR cells clearly indicate that PTH stimulation of collagenase-3 promoter activity is completely abrogated by PKA inhibition and not by inhibition of the other pathways. Other studies in our laboratory have shown that the ERK pathway inhibitor PD98059 inhibits ERKs (ERK1 and ERK2) at 50 μm and the PKC pathway inhibitor GF109203X inhibits PKC at 1 μm in UMR cells (data not shown). If PTH-induced collagenase-3 promoter activity is regulated through either the ERK or the PKC signaling pathway, then those inhibitors used at the concentrations in these studies should have inhibited the PTH effect. This is not the case. Many genes such as α1(I) collagen (40.Kream B.E. Lafrancis D. Petersen D.N. Woody C. Clark S. Rowe D.W. Lichtler A. Mol.

Evidence is presented that covalent modification influences ligand binding to receptors in complexes with CheW and the kinase CheA. Kinase inhibition was measured with serine receptor complexes in different modification levels; Ki for serine-mediated inhibition increased 10,000-fold from the lowest to the highest level. Without CheA and CheW, ligand binding is unaffected by covalent modification; thus, the influence of covalent modification is mediated only in the receptor complex, a conclusion supported by an analogy to allosteric enzymes and the observation of cooperative kinase inhibition. Also, the finding that a subsaturating serine concentration accelerates active receptor–kinase complex assembly implies that the assembly/disassembly process may also contribute to kinase regulation."

Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, biotin synthase is known to contain a [4Fe-4S]2+ iron-sulfur cluster, and recent works (17.Busby R.W. Schelvis J.P.M., Yu, D.S. Babcock G.T. Marletta M.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 4706-4707Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 18.Ollagnier-de Choudens S. Fontecave M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that LipA is also an iron-sulfur protein. Strains of E. coli with mutations in lipA were shown to grow only in the presence of 8-thiooctanoate (16.Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hayden M.A. Huang I.Y. Iliopoulos G. Orozco M. Ashley G.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3778-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or 6-thiooctanoate (16.Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) implicating the involvement of LipA in the insertion of the first sulfur into octanoate. At last, two other genes of E. coli were shown to intervene in the metabolism of lipoic acid, lplA and lipB encoding, respectively, for proteins of 38 and 25 kDa (16.Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1325-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins were shown to be involved in the attachment of lipoic acid to the apoprotein form of the lipoyl-containing protein. In the presence of free exogenous lipoic acid, LplA utilizes ATP to generate the activated lipoyl-AMP species and then transfers the lipoyl group to the acceptor protein (20.Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16091-16100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 22.Green D.E. Morris T.W. Green J. Cronan J.E. Guest J.R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 853-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), whereas lipB is required for the attachment of lipoyl groups, linked to ACP,1 produced via endogenous biosynthesis (21.Morris T.W. Reed K.E. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 23.Jordan S.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17903-17906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, most of the lipoate-containing enzymes are located in the mitochondria and have been studied intensively. However, the mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of lipoic acid and its incorporation into apoproteins have been less investigated. Despite the existence of four independent complementation groups (lip1–4) defective in lipoic acid metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (24.Tzagoloff A. Dieckmann C.L. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 211-225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the exact functions of the corresponding genes remain unknown. Lip5 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25.Sulo P. Martin N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17634-17639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Lip1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (26.Yasuno R. Wada H. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 935-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have been isolated and found to be homologous to the E. coli lipA. In addition, an analogue of E. coli lipB in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis has also been isolated (27.Chen X.J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 341-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast with the situation observed in E. coli, in mammals, the activation of free exogenous lipoic acid in lipoyl-AMP and its covalent attachment to the lipoyl-accepting enzyme is catalyzed by two distinct mitochondrial enzymes, the lipoate-activating enzyme and the lipoyl-AMP:N ε-lysine lipoyltransferase (28.Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter enzyme, which appeared as two isoforms, has been isolated (28.Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16605-16609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cloned (29.Fujiwara K. Okamura-Ikeda K. Motokawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31974-31978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30.Fujiwara K. Suzuki M. Okumachi Y. Okamura-Ikeda K. Fujiwara T. Takahashi E. Motokawa Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Production of fatty acids up to 14 carbons from malonate was detected in Neurospora crassa mitochondria (31.Brody S. Mikolajczyk S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and is related to the presence of ACP within the organelle (32.Mikolajczyk S. Brody S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent work suggests that the mitochondrial fatty acid biosynthetic pathway was involved in lipoic acid synthesis (23.Jordan S.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17903-17906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 33.Wada H. Shintani D. Ohlrogge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1591-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 34.Brody S. Oh C. Hoja U. Schweizer E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Jordan and Cronan (23.Jordan S.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17903-17906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that plant mitochondria contain a lipoate transferase that used lipoyl-ACP as the lipoate donor to attach lipoate to the dehydrogenase complexes. By taking advantage of an available system for producing recombinant H apoprotein, a lipoate-accepting protein (35.Macherel D. Bourguignon J. Forest E. Faure M. Cohen-Addad C. Douce R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 236: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we sought to investigate the lipoic acid biosynthesis in plant mitochondria, using malonate as the precursor. We have thus characterized the different biochemical steps involved in the transformation of malonate into lipoic acid by a soluble protein extract (matrix extract) isolated from pea leaf mitochondria. We have also devised a new method using mass spectrometry to monitor all the acyl-ACP and H protein intermediates formed during the functioning of the enzymes involved in the mitochondrial fatty acid and lipoic acid biosynthesis. Mitochondria were isolated and purified from pea leaves (washed with 5% sodium hypochlorite to eliminate contaminating bacteria) as described by Douceet al. (36.Douce R. Bourguignon J. Brouquisse R. Neuburger M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 403-415Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The purified mitochondria (about 200 mg of proteins) were diluted in 40 ml of buffer containing 40 mmMOPS (pH 7.4) and 1 mm DTT. Total release of the matrix protein was achieved by three cycles of freezing and thawing. The suspension of broken mitochondria was then centrifuged at 38,000 rpm for 1 h (Beckman SW-40 rotor) to remove all the mitochondrial membranes. The supernatant was then concentrated on a 3-kDa Diaflo membrane using a stirred ultrafiltration cell (Amicon) on a magnetic stirring table to a concentration of about 50 mg/ml. Recombinant H apoproteins (wild type and HE14A mutant) were produced and purified as described by Gueguen et al. (37.Gueguen V. Macherel D. Neuburger M. Saint Pierre C. Jaquinod M. Gans P. Douce R. Bourguignon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 37: 26344-26352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). P protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex was purified from pea leaf mitochondria as described by Bourguignon et al. (38.Bourguignon J. Neuburger M. Douce R. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). E. coli ACP (5 mg) from Sigma was purified by fast performance liquid chromatography using a Mono Q-HR5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) previously equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2 mm DTT. Proteins were eluted with a continuously increasing NaCl gradient (0–1 m) (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min; fraction size, 1 ml). The fractions containing ACP (analyzed by SDS-PAGE) were pooled and dialyzed extensively at 4 °C against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 2 mm DTT. The proteins were then concentrated using a 3K-Centricon (Filtron) by centrifugation to a final concentration of about 2 mg/ml. The mass of the E. coli ACP (8842 Da) deduced from the primary amino acid sequence was checked by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (see below). Malonyl-CoA synthetase activity was measured as described by Kim and Bang (39.Kim Y.S. Bang S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) using the malonohydroxamate assay. This assay is based on the determination of malonohydroxamate formed by the reaction of hydroxylamine with malonyl-CoA produced by the enzyme. This assay was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 40 mm sodium malonate, 200 mm NH2OH, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 500 μm CoASH, and 200 μg of matrix extract proteins in a final volume of 0.5 ml. After 2 h, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.25 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. Then 0.5 ml of 15% FeCl3 solution in 0.66 n HCl was added to the reaction mixture. After elimination of the precipitated proteins by centrifugation, the intensity of the red-brown color developed by the formation of Fe3+ complex of malonohydroxamate was monitored at 540 nm (ε = 842m−1·cm−1) using an Uvicon 810 spectrophotometer. Malonyl-CoA:acyl carrier protein transacylase activity was measured as described by Guerra and Ohlrogge (40.Guerra D.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 274-285Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As this enzyme has never been described before, we have established two assays to follow its activity. This assay was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mmTris (pH 7.4) containing 65 μm E. coli ACP, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm [2-14C]malonic acid (0.1 μCi; 56 mCi/mmol) (ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was initiated with matrix extract proteins (100 μg). After mixing, the reaction was allowed to proceed for 10 or 30 min. The reaction mixture was then pipetted onto 1.5 × 1.5-cm Whatman No. 3 filter paper. Filter papers were then immediately placed in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid (5–8 ml/filter), gently stirred for 1 h, and subsequently washed in a Buchner funnel with additional cold trichloroacetic acid. Under these conditions, ACP and labeled [2-14C]malonyl-ACP precipitate onto the filter paper, whereas washing eliminates the non-incorporated [2-14C]malonate. The entire washing procedure was repeated, and finally filter papers were counted in a Betamatic V Kontron Instruments scintillation counter. A different assay was also performed using non-radioactive malonate. In that case, the ATP-dependent attachment of malonate to ACP was followed using mass spectrometry analysis. The assay was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ATP, 65 μm E. coli ACP, and matrix extract proteins (5 mg/ml) in a final volume of 25 or 50 μl. The reaction was initiated with 25 mm malonate. After incubation (0 to several hours), the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2-propanol. After mixing, the samples were kept at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant enriched in ACPs was removed and analyzed by MALDI-MS (see below). Condensation reactions catalyzed by fatty-acid synthase were monitored by following the incorporation of malonate into acyl-ACPs of different chain lengths using mass spectrometry. The assay was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mmMOPS (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm DTT, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm NADH, 5 mm NADPH, 10 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CoASH, 65 μm E. coli ACP, and 5 mg/ml matrix extract proteins in a final volume of 25 or 50 μl. The reaction was initiated with 25 mm malonate. After incubation (0 to several hours), the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2-propanol. After mixing, the samples were kept at room temperature for 60 min. Subsequently, the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 ×g. The supernatant enriched in ACPs was removed, separated by high performance liquid chromatography (see below), and analyzed by MALDI-MS (see below). [2- 14C]Malonate incorporation into H apoprotein (octanoylation and lipoylation) was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm CoASH, 5 mm NADH, 5 mmNADPH, 10 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm purified E. coli ACP, in the absence or in presence (10 μm) of H apoprotein and 2 or 20 mg/ml of matrix extract proteins in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 180 μm [2-14C]malonate (2 μCi; 56 mCi/mmol). Aliquots of 5 μl were taken at different times, and the reaction was stopped by adding 15 μl of protein sample buffer containing 67 mm Tris-HCl, 133 mm DTT, 13.3% (v/v) glycerol, 2.7% (w/v) SDS, and 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. These aliquot samples (20 μl) were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the dried gel was autoradiographed or analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). A similar assay was also performed in a final volume of 20 μl in the presence of 10 mg/ml of matrix extract with omission, one by one, of all the reaction components, the reaction being conducted for 60 min (for more details see legend of Fig. 3). The modification of H apoprotein (octanoylation and/or lipoylation) catalyzed by a matrix extract in the presence of malonate was monitored using mass spectrometry analysis (see below). In that case, we used a mutant of H apoprotein (HE14A mutant) that has a mass different from that of the wild type present in the matrix extract (37.Gueguen V. Macherel D. Neuburger M. Saint Pierre C. Jaquinod M. Gans P. Douce R. Bourguignon J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 37: 26344-26352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This strategy allows us to discriminate easily by mass spectrometry wild type H protein from the mutant. In that case, the assay was conducted at 30 °C in 40 mm MOPS (pH 7.4) containing 1 mmDTT, 0.5 mm CoASH, 5 mm NADH, 5 mmNADPH, 10 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 24 μm purified E. coli ACP, 2 mmcysteine, 2 mm Na2S (acting as sulfur donors), 1 mm AdoMet (as a source of deoxyadenosyl radical produced by monoelectronic reductive cleavage of the sulfonium moiety), 50 μm (0.66 mg/ml) H apoprotein, and 10 mg/ml matrix extract proteins in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated with 25 mm malonate. After 6 h of incubation, ammonium sulfate was then added to 60% saturation, and the solution was kept at 4 °C for 45 min. Upon centrifugation (18,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was brought to 100% saturation with ammonium sulfate, stored for 45 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged again. The pellet, containing the majority of the H protein (mutant and wild type), was dialyzed against 1 liter of 1 mm ammonium acetate and concentrated on a 3K-MicroSep centrifugal concentrator (Pall Filtron) by centrifugation. Samples were then analyzed by mass spectrometry. In order to verify the presence of lipoylated HE14A protein in the incubation medium and to discriminate the lipoylated form from the octanoylated form, aliquots of the purified H proteins were incubated at 30 °C during 30 min in presence of 0.2 μm of the P protein of the glycine decarboxylase complex, 20 μmpyridoxal phosphate, and 20 mm glycine. In these conditions, the oxidative decarboxylation of glycine occurs, and the active lipoylated H protein becomes loaded with methylamine. The resulting modification of the H protein by the methylamine group (+32 Da) was followed by MALDI-MS. On the other hand, the octanoylated H protein remains unaltered under the same conditions. The ACP mixtures (see under “Fatty-acid Synthase Assay”) were first dried and then dissolved in water containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v). Separations of the different acyl-ACPs were performed with an Applied Biosystems A 130 (Perkin-Elmer) HPLC apparatus using a reversed-phase column (Brownlee, C8, 5 μm, 1 × 100 mm). Elution of polypeptides, monitored at 214 nm, was performed by an isocratic gradient during 5 min at 100% solvent A (water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), and then a linear gradient was run from 0 to 50% solvent B (acetonitrile/water, 90/10, containing 0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) with a flow rate of 50 μl/min and then from 50 to 100% solvent B in 5 min. Peaks were collected and analyzed by MALDI-MS. Mass spectra of modified ACP were obtained with a Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer Voyager Elite XI (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) equipped with a 337-nm nitrogen laser. A mass spectrum of each sample was recorded by averaging approximately 128 laser shots at various locations across the spot. All spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode with delayed extraction. After a 200-ns delay time, the first acceleration grid was set to 25,000 V and the second acceleration grid to 93.7% of this value or 23.425 V. The guide wire in the flight tube was held at 0.075% of the pulse acceleration value (18.75 V). Aliquots of the protein and the matrix solutions (0.5 μl each) were mixed on the stainless steel sample plate and dried in the air prior to mass spectrometry analysis. External calibration was performed with porcine insulin (m/z = 5835) obtained from Sigma. All experiments were performed using saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid prepared in a 50% (v/v) solution of acetonitrile/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a SCIEX API III+ triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer) equipped with a nebulizer-assisted electrospray source. Calibration was performed in positive mode using poly(propylenel-glycol) ions. The H protein spectra were acquired in multichannel acquisition mode on a m/z range from 600 to 1600, with a scan of 0.4 m/z and a dwell time of 2 ms. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide, 0.1% SDS as separating gel; 5% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide, 0.1% SDS as stacking gel) as described by Sambrook et al. (41.Sambrook J. Fritsch F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Gels were stained with R-250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue. After 30 min of incubation in a solution containing 3% acetate and 7% glycerol, gels were dried onto Whatman No. 3MM paper. Protein concentrations were estimated by the method of Lowry et al. (42.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Plant mitochondria are devoid of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (43.Baldet P. Alban C. Axiolis S. Douce R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) that prohibits them from synthesizing malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. Malonate entering into the mitochondria must be activated before its incorporation into fatty acids. We postulated that malonate could be activated into malonyl-CoA, and we investigated the presence of a malonate-CoA synthetase in the soluble fraction of the plant mitochondria. This enzyme has been purified and characterized from Pseudomonas fluorescens that was grown on malonate as a sole source of carbon (44.Kim Y.S. Bang R.H. J. Biol Chem. 1985; 260: 5098-5104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and from Rhizobium japonicum (45.Kim, Y. S., and Chae, H. Z. (1991) 273, 511–516Google Scholar). By using the malonohydroxamate assay described by Kim and Bang (39.Kim Y.S. Bang S.K. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we showed that plant mitochondria contain a malonate-CoA synthetase with a V m value of 1.9 nmol of malonyl-CoA formed per min and per mg of matrix extract proteins (Table I, part A). The conversion of malonate into malonyl-CoA shows an absolute requirement for ATP, CoASH, and a divalent cation (Mg2+). The reaction of the malonyl-CoA synthetase is linear from 0 to 120 min, and there is a linear relationship between malonyl-CoA formation rates and the amount of matrix enzymes. The activity of malonyl-CoA synthetase was assayed as a function of pH by buffering the reaction medium with either MOPS or Tris from pH 6.5 to 10. At 30 °C, the enzyme showed a broad pH optimum (with maximum ranging from pH 7.3 to 9). The malonyl-CoA synthetase displays a rather low affinity for Mg2+ with an apparent K m value of 1 mm. The kinetics experiments were carried out under steady-state conditions at saturated Mg2+ concentration (10 mm) with various concentrations of substrates. Malonyl-CoA synthetase from pea mitochondria exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to malonate, CoASH, and ATP. The apparent K m values for these substrates, determined by using double reciprocal plot method (Lineweaver-Burk equation), were 5.2 mm, 215 μm, and 384 μm, respectively.Table IMalonyl-CoA synthetase (A) and Malonyl-ACP synthetase (B) activities in a matrix extract of mitochondria isolated from pea leavesReaction mixtureActivityRelative ratenmol/min/mg% controlA.

Detection was performed according to the method described by Guerra and Ohlrogge (40.Guerra D.J. Ohlrogge J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 245: 274-285Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and we could show that plant mitochondria contain a powerful malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (V m value of 52 nmol of malonyl-ACP formed per min and per mg of soluble mitochondrial proteins). We tried to detect the presence of a “malonyl-ACP synthetase” in the matrix extract. This enzymatic activity (V m value of 0.2 nmol of malonyl-ACP formed per min and per mg of matrix extract proteins) was characterized in a medium devoid of CoASH by following the production of acid-insoluble radiolabeled malonyl-ACP in the presence of [2-14C]malonic acid (see “Material and Methods”). The conversion of malonate to malonyl-ACP shows an absolute requirement for ATP and Mg2+ (Table I, part B), and a 50% stimulation was observed with 1 mm DTT (Table I, part B). Malonyl-ACP synthetase from pea mitochondria exhibited Michaelis-Menten kinetics with respect to malonate. The apparent K m value for ACP was determined to be 53 μm. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometry (MS) was also used to monitor the disappearance of free ACP concomitant with the production of malonyl-ACP. The reaction that was performed using cold malonate and ACP as substrates was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 2-propanol. ACP (and its derivatives) was partially purified by taking advantage of its high solubility in 2-propanol (Ref.46.Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 341-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, see also “Materials and Methods”) and then analyzed by MALDI-MS.

This pathway of eNOS activation is unique to a limited number of stimuli, including shear stress, the response to which is herbimycin-inhibitable. Consistent with this, herbimycin and geldanamycin pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) abrogated E2-stimulated NO release and cGMP production, respectively. These benzoquinone ansamycins are potent inhibitors of Hsp90 function, which has recently been shown to play a role in stimulus-dependent eNOS activation. As in response to shear, E2 induced an Hsp90-eNOS association, peaking at 30 min and completely inhibited by the conventional estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780.

This is likely to be mediated, in part, by augmentation of nitric oxide (NO)1 release because estrogen has been demonstrated to produce a significant increase in the levels of bioavailable NO (2.Imthurn B. Rosselli M. Jaeger A. Keller P. Dubey R. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 388-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 3.Guetta V. Quyyumi A. Prasad A. Panza J. Waclawiw M. Cannon R.

Invest. 1997; 99: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro model system of vascular endothelial cells (EC), we and others have demonstrated that EC secrete NO rapidly after stimulation with estrogen (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 7.Hayashi T. Yamada K. Esaki T. Kuzuya M. Satake S. Ishikawa T. Hidaka H. Iguchi A. Biochem.

Physiol. 1997; 293: L119-L126Google Scholar). Our data have also shown that the increase in NO release is due to activation of the endothelial form of NO synthase (eNOS or NOS 3). This activation appears to significantly reduce the calcium-calmodulin dependence of the enzyme, and we have further demonstrated that treatment of human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) with estrogen, under conditions which result in NO release, does not result in a measurable increase in free intracellular calcium (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). This pathway of eNOS activation is unique to a limited number of stimuli, which include the sustained phase of shear stress-induced vasodilation (9.Kuchan M. Frangos J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 266: C628-C636Crossref Google Scholar, 10.Ayajiki K. Kinderman M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 11.Corson M. James N. Latta S. Nerem R. Berk B. Harrison D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The activity of eNOS has been shown to be regulated by multiple factors including: post-translational fatty acid modification (including palmitoylation and myristoylation (12.Busconi L. Michel T. J.

Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Binding of eNOS to Hsp90 has been shown to occur in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), histamine, and shear stress; and eNOS activity is increased in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Hsp90 (23.Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). Furthermore, geldanamycin also significantly decreases activation of eNOS by VEGF and histamine as well as acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (23.Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar). The benzoquinone ansamycin antibiotics, which include herbimycin and geldanamycin, have been shown to disrupt a number of tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and reverse cellular transformation by Src (24.Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E. De Costa B. Myers C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), leading to their use as “specific” tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, more recent evidence suggests that most of these effects may be mediated by their ability to impair Hsp90 function rather than a direct effect on the protein kinase itself (25.Stancato L. Silverstein A. Owens-Grillo J. Chow Y. Jove R. Pratt W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4013-4020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which estrogen regulates eNOS activity is the focus of this and ongoing studies in our laboratory. In this report, we demonstrate that the ansamycins inhibit estrogen-mediated HUVEC NO release, cGMP production, and calcium-independent NOS activity. We show that 17β-estradiol (E2) promotes a rapid Hsp90-eNOS association, an effect that is blocked by a conventional estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist. These findings demonstrate that Hsp90 plays an important role in the regulation of eNOS function by estrogen. 17β-Estradiol and water-soluble 17β-estradiol (estradiol in cyclodextrin) were purchased from Sigma. Estradiol stocks were prepared in ethanol and stored at −20 °C. The final concentration of ethanol in all cell cultures was ≤0.01%. All controls were treated with identical concentrations of ethanol (vehicle) simultaneously with the addition of estradiol. Water-soluble estradiol stocks were made fresh for each experiment in sterile phosphate-buffered saline. ICI 182,780 was purchased from Zeneca Pharmaceuticals. Herbimycin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and geldanamycin was from Calbiochem. Herbimycin and geldanamycin were dissolved in Me2SO and stored at −20 °C. The final concentration of Me2SO in all cultures and controls (in all experiments where herbimycin was used) was ≤0.1%. Antibodies were purchased from the following sources: anti-eNOS (N30020), Transduction Laboratories; anti-Hsp90 (SPA-845), StressGen; and anti-calmodulin, Upstate Biotechnology. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. HUVEC were isolated from single female donors as described previously (26.Pfau S. Leitenberg D. Rinder H. Smith B. Pardi R. Bender J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Cells were routinely passaged on gelatin-coated plates in M199 with 15% fetal bovine serum, bovine endothelial cell growth supplement (50 μg/ml, Collaborative Research), and heparin (100 μg/ml). Prior to E2stimulation, cells were cultured in phenol red-free M199 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with gelding serum (Sigma, lot 114H4629, <1.0 pg/ml estradiol) and no endothelial cell growth supplement/heparin for 24–48 h. NOx (including NO2−, NO3−, and nitrosothiols) was measured in aqueous media after a 1-h equilibration time using a chemiluminescent assay and a commercial NO analyzer (Siemans) as described previously (14.Sessa W. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I. Desai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cell monolayers were trypsinized, and single-cell suspensions were counted to determine the number of cells present in each experimental sample. NOx levels are expressed in terms of total NOx liberated (picomoles/total cell number). eNOS activity was assayed in total cell lysates as described previously (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were made in the presence of EDTA (0.1 mm) and EGTA (0.1 mm) to chelate free calcium released with cell disruption. To determine the maximal NOS activity in each sample, exogenous calcium (2.5 mm), calmodulin (100 nm), BH4 (30 μm), and NADPH (1 mm) were added. The amount of NOS activity in each sample determined in the presence of all these cofactors was set at 100%, and NOS activity in each sample under other conditions (e.g. without added calcium and calmodulin) was calculated as a percentage of this activity. Subsequently, conversion of l-[3H]arginine to [3H]citrulline was measured by column chromatographic separation of these two molecules and liquid scintillation counting. HUVEC monolayers were stimulated as described in the figure legends. Total cell lysates were made on ice in buffer containing: 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 20 mm NaMoO4. Immunoprecipitations were carried out in the presence of primary antibody (anti-eNOS N30020, 1–2 μg/mg of total cell protein) for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by overnight incubation with a 1:1 protein A:protein G-Sepharose slurry. Following washes, immunoprecipitates were boiled in sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted. The primary antibodies used for immunoblotting were anti-eNOS (1:2500), anti-calmodulin (1:1000), or anti-Hsp90 (1:500). Blots were then probed with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by autoradiography using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). cGMP was acid-extracted from intact cell monolayers as described previously (27.Papapetropoulos A. Marczin N. Snead M. Cheng C. Milici A. Catravas J. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 476-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Samples were pH-neutralized, and cGMP levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay kit (Biomedical Technologies Inc.). Our previous data demonstrate that E2 stimulation of HUVEC alters the calcium dependence of the enzyme toward a more calcium-independent state (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The inducible form of NOS (iNOS) also shows a relative state of calcium independence. Active enzyme complexes of iNOS have been demonstrated to contain calmodulin, even in the presence of only trace levels of calcium (28.Cho H. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R. Swidereck K. Lee T. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Calmodulin binding appears to impart a crucial conformational change in the complex, which allows NOS activation without an increase in free intracellular calcium. Using this as a model, we asked whether E2stimulation could induce increased binding of calmodulin to eNOS under conditions in which E2 does not appear to increase free intracellular calcium levels (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, E2 does not affect the total amount of calmodulin bound to eNOS in HUVEC. This suggests that the mechanism by which E2 activates eNOS does not involve significant changes in calmodulin binding to the enzyme complex in the absence of increased cytosolic calcium. The rapid augmentation in NO release induced by E2 suggests a post-translational event. Because calcium-independent, flow-mediated vasodilation is abrogated by herbimycin (10.Ayajiki K. Kinderman M. Hecker M. Fleming I. Busse R. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 750-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 11.Corson M. James N. Latta S. Nerem R. Berk B. Harrison D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), experiments were performed to evaluate whether the effect of E2 on eNOS is also herbimycin-inhibitable. As shown in Fig. 2, pretreatment of HUVEC with herbimycin completely abolishes the increase in NO production seen after E2 treatment. Furthermore, this herbimycin effect is also seen at the level of eNOS activity. That is, in cell-free assays, eNOS activity is undetectable in calcium/calmodulin-free conditions, as expected (Fig. 3). As we have previously shown, eNOS recovered from HUVEC pretreated for 24 h with E2 exhibits maximal activity in the same calcium/calmodulin-free conditions. However, herbimycin pretreatment largely abrogates the calcium/calmodulin independence of this enzyme induced by E2, an effect we have also previously shown to be inhibited by conventional ER antagonists (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Basal and E2-stimulated activity were inhibited byl-NAME, demonstrating that the activity measured was due specifically to NOS activation (Fig. 3 and data not shown).Figure 3Effect of 17β-estradiol on calcium-dependent eNOS activity. Confluent HUVEC monolayers were incubated with herbimycin (1 μg/ml) or vehicle overnight (12 h) at 37 °C. Monolayers were then stimulated with E2 (50 ng/ml) or vehicle for 60 min at 37 °C. eNOS activity was assayed using an in vitro l-[3H]arginine tol-[3H]citrulline conversion enzymatic assay, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” To determine relative calcium/calmodulin dependence of eNOS, lysates were made in the presence of calcium chelators.

More detailed biochemical analysis of these molecules has revealed that they have significant effects on the function of the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Because herbimycin has a potent effect on E2-stimulated NO release and Hsp90 appears to have a regulatory effect on eNOS function (23.Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar), we evaluated whether E2 stimulation of human EC promotes an Hsp90-eNOS association, one that could be critical in modulating eNOS activity. Figs. 4 and5 demonstrate that E2 rapidly stimulates Hsp90 association with eNOS. In contrast to the VEGF response, in which maximal Hsp90-eNOS association can be seen within 1 min, the E2 response peaks at 30 min, at which time maximal association occurs (Fig. 4). This pattern is similar to that seen in shear stress-activated EC (23.Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Fan R. Shah V. Sorrentino R. Cirino G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1998; 392: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (865) Google Scholar).Figure 5Effect of an ER antagonist on 17β-estradiol-induced Hsp90-eNOS association.Confluent HUVEC monolayers were incubated with E2 (10 ng/ml) and/or ICI 182,780 (10 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C, after which eNOS was immunoprecipitated. After SDS-PAGE and transfer, the immunoprecipitates were probed first with an anti-Hsp90 antibody (top panel) and reprobed with an anti-eNOS antibody (bottom panel). Results are representative of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E2-stimulated Hsp90-eNOS association is completely abrogated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 4 and 5 with lane 2). The finding that this antagonist blocks both E2-stimulated NO release and the induced molecular complex formation is consistent with Hsp90-eNOS association playing a critical role in the pathway by which E2 activates eNOS and modulates NO release. To test whether the effects of herbimycin on E2-stimulated NO release are also seen with other ansamycin benzoquinones, HUVEC intracellular cGMP levels (reflective of biofunctional NO production) were measured in E2-stimulated cells pretreated with geldanamycin (GA). As opposed to herbimycin, GA does not require prolonged pretreatment of the cells, thereby allowing evaluation of ansamycin effects over a much shorter time span (20 min). As we have previously shown, the rapid E2-stimulated increase in cGMP production is inhibited by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780. GA completely abrogates this E2-stimulated increase in cGMP production (Fig. 6). These results support the concept that ansamycins, as a class, prevent E2-mediated modulation of eNOS activity by disrupting critical Hsp90-dependent signaling events. Both estrogen and NO play critical roles in blood vessel development, function, and remodeling. Understanding the interplay between these two powerful, interdependent vascular modulators may be a first step in designing strategies for treating conditions such as ischemic, diabetic, and postmenopausal vascular dysfunction. Our data provide answers to some important initial questions regarding regulation of eNOS activity by estrogen. Investigations into the similarities and differences between the three known isoforms of NOS have led to insights into how cellular secretion of NO can be a critical step in processes as diverse as immune responses and neuronal signaling. The finding that estrogen-activated eNOS displays a decrease in calcium dependence led us to hypothesize that estrogen causes eNOS to function similarly to its “calcium-independent” counterpart, iNOS, by allowing a shift in the ability of eNOS to interact with calmodulin under conditions of very low free intracellular calcium. This hypothesis was supported by our previous data showing that addition of histamine to estradiol-stimulated HUVEC does not result in a further increase in NOS activity over that seen with estradiol alone (6.Caulin-Glaser T. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Sarrel P. Sessa W. Bender J. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). However, our current data demonstrate that easily detectable levels of calmodulin are eNOS-bound in unstimulated HUVEC and that E2 does not increase these levels. The conformation of calmodulin, when bound to its target proteins, determines its ability to promote enzyme activation (29.Krueger J. Olah G. Rokop S. Zhi G. Stull J. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6017-6023Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is possible that estrogen alters the conformation and/or function of calmodulin already associated with eNOS, thereby modulating its interaction with the recently described eNOS autoinhibitory domain (30.Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). There are several similarities in the pathway by which estrogen and shear stress augment eNOS activity. Both stimuli elicit a relative calcium independence of the enzyme (9.Kuchan M. Frangos J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 266: C628-C636Crossref Google Scholar). Both shear and estrogen effects are inhibited by “protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.” Either genistein or herbimycin has been used in a majority of these studies. Although the effect of genistein on E2 responses can be difficult to interpret, based on its phytoestrogenic properties, it has been used extensively as a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Genistein has been shown to reduce shear stress-induced NO release, with a proposed modulatory effect on shear-induced eNOS phosphorylation (11.Corson M. James N. Latta S. Nerem R. Berk B. Harrison D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 984-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Isometric contraction of rabbit aortic rings is another dynamic model of induced NO release in which eNOS becomes relatively calcium/calmodulin-independent. However, eNOS activation by isometric contraction is unaffected by genistein (31.Fleming I. Bauersachs J. Schäfer A. Scholz D. Aldershvile J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1123-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In contrast, herbimycin effectively inhibits isometric contraction-mediated NO release. In those studies, attempts were made to correlate modulation of NO release with alteration in patterns of protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Several proteins, but not eNOS itself, were shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to isometric contraction. As with NO analyses, herbimycin, but not genistein, dramatically decreased aortic EC phosphotyrosine content in response to isometric contraction. These findings support the concept that herbimycin effects on stimulated eNOS may occur through mechanisms other than direct inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation. Indeed, our data indicate that ansamycin effects on E2-stimulated eNOS activation involve their ability to disrupt Hsp90 function. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of these effects are due to alteration in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins, which may be involved in eNOS regulation. The ansamycins specifically bind the amino-terminal portion of Hsp90 in a region that is required for ATP binding and consequently decrease this interaction (32.Grenert J. Sullivan W. Fadden P. Haystead T. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H. Schutze T. Sausville E. Necker L. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 33.Prodomou C. Roe S. O'Brien R. Ladbury J. Piper P. Pearl L. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that the phosphorylation state of the adenine nucleotide that is bound to Hsp90 appears to affect the formation of Hsp90-associated multimolecular complexes. In that study, GA inhibited Hsp90 complex formation with p23 and immunophilins (34.Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8007-8012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Interference with Hsp90-pp60v- src complex formation by herbimycin or GA has also been shown to block v-src-mediated cellular transformation (24.Whitesell L. Mimnaugh E. De Costa B. Myers C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8324-8328Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). In other systems, the effects of ansamycins on Hsp90 function appear to occur in the absence of physical disruption of complex formation between the regulated protein and Hsp90. 1) GA interferes with steroid hormone receptor function without disrupting hormone receptor/Hsp90 heterocomplex formation (35.Segnitz B. Gehring U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18694-18701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); and 2) interference with Ah receptor function by GA occurs in the absence of disruption of its physical association with Hsp90 (36.Chen H. Singh S. Perdew G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We also did not observe a quantitative decrease in E2-induced Hsp90-eNOS complex formation in the presence of herbimycin (data not shown). In the cytosol, classical ligand-free ERs (ERα) are part of a multimolecular complex that includes several chaperones, including Hsp90. It is unlikely that the key molecular switch mediating E2/ER activation of eNOS is induction of a shift in the specific Hsp90 pool from ER- to eNOS-bound, because the heat shock proteins are among the most abundant cytoplasmic proteins. Therefore, the fraction of Hsp90 bound to ER even under E2-deprived conditions is unlikely to be a limiting factor in the amount of Hsp90 available for binding to other proteins such as eNOS. Furthermore, estrogen receptor antagonists can also cause dissociation of Hsp90 from ER (37.Devin-Leclerc J. Meng X. Delahaye F. Leclerc P. Baulieu E. Catelli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 842-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which would predict that these antagonists could cause increased Hsp90-eNOS binding and eNOS activation (in contrast to our findings). Although both ansamycins and ER antagonists can disrupt E2/ER signaling, our data suggest that in the case of eNOS activation by E2, these agents are not acting identically. ICI 182,780 blocks E2-induced Hsp90-eNOS association whereas GA does not. This is particularly interesting in light of other data from our laboratory suggesting that eNOS activation may be mediated by a surface receptor for estrogen, 2K. Russell, P. Haynes, and J. Bender, submitted for publication. and this “surface ER” may have differential requirements for Hsp90 function as compared with traditional “nuclear” ERs. The pathway through which E2 activates rapid signaling events is currently poorly defined. Non-genomic effects of E2/ER have been described in multiple systems and include rapid alterations in phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, levels of intracellular cAMP, and activation of the p21 ras /mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (38.Migliaccio A. Pagano M. Auricchio F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2183-2191PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E. Auricchio F.

A. 1994; 91: 8517-8521Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Estrogen has also been shown to activate the phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase/Akt signaling pathway in breast and uterine cells (41.Ahmad S. Singh N. Glazer R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 42.Richards R. Walker M. Sebastian J. DiAugustine R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11962-11969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Akt activation has been shown to occur in a calcium-independent manner after stimulation by growth factors (e.g. epidermal growth factor (43.Conus N. Hemmings B. Pearson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 273: 4776-4782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (100) Google Scholar)) and by shear stress (44.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have shown that eNOS is serine-phosphorylated in response to Akt activation (44.Dimmeler S. Fleming I. Fisslthaler B. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (3056) Google Scholar, 45.Fulton D. Gratton J. McCabe T. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). This modification leads to activation of eNOS in a manner that appears to reduce its calcium dependence. Interestingly, Akt-mediated eNOS activation can be seen in response to both calcium-dependent (e.g. VEGF) and calcium-independent (e.g. shear stress) stimuli. The finding that herbimycin A does not block shear stress-induced Akt activation (46.Dimmeler S. Assmus B. Hermann C. Haendeler J. Zeiher A. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) suggests either that functional Hsp90- eNOS association is a critical downstream mediator of eNOS activation by Akt or that the pathways by which Akt and Hsp90 regulate eNOS activity are independent. The idea that these may represent independent pathways is also supported by the finding that the phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 only partially block VEGF- or insulin-stimulated NO release (47.Papapetropoulos A. Garcı́a-Cardeña G. Madri J. Sessa W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3131-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 48.Zeng G. Quon M. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 894-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar), whereas wortmannin completely abrogates eNOS serine phosphorylation (45.Fulton D. Gratton J. McCabe T. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent studies have defined an autoinhibitory loop within the eNOS reductase domain (30.Nishida C. Ortiz de Montellano P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14692-14698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Deletion of this loop greatly reduces the calcium requirements of the enzyme. It is possible that estrogen induces a bipartite eNOS activation response, one that depends on Akt and affects the conformation of the autoinhibitory domain and the other that recruits required effectors through an induced Hsp90-eNOS association. Experiments are currently under way to determine the interplay between estrogen-induced Hsp90-eNOS association and modulation of eNOS by Akt. In summary, we have found that the mechanism by which estrogen activates eNOS involves an alteration in the binding of this enzyme to Hsp90. We hope that further elucidation of the individual steps in this pathway will allow development of novel therapeutic strategies for regulating endothelial NO production.

To assess the functional role of rafts in the present work, we studied the effect of cholesterol depletion on apical membrane trafficking in enterocytes. Cultured mucosal explants of pig small intestine were treated for 2 h with the cholesterol sequestering agent methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The treatment reduced the cholesterol content >50%. Morphologically, the Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network was partially transformed into numerous 100–200 nm vesicles. By immunogold electron microscopy, aminopeptidase N was localized in these Golgi-derived vesicles as well as at the basolateral cell surface, indicating a partial missorting. Biochemically, the rates of the Golgi-associated complex glycosylation and association with rafts of newly synthesized aminopeptidase N were reduced, and less of the enzyme had reached the brush border membrane after 2 h of labeling. In contrast, the basolateral Na+/K+-ATPase was neither missorted nor raft-associated. Our results implicate the Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network in raft formation and suggest a close relationship between this event and apical membrane trafficking.

Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 2.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 3.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref Scopus (2557) Google Scholar), cholesterol together with sphingoglycolipids spontaneously form microdomains or “rafts” in the exoplasmic leaflet of the bilayer of biological membranes. In physical terms, rafts are characterized as membrane domains that are in a liquid-ordered or gel phase, probably by virtue of the ability of cholesterol and sphingolipids to form hydrogen bonds and, in case of the latter, by having higher acyl chain melting temperatures than glycerolipids (4.van Meer G. Burger K.N.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 332-337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5.Schroeder R. London E. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10944-10953Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The biological significance of rafts lies in their ability to act as lateral sorting platforms for various subsets of membrane proteins that associate with them (2.Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar, 3.Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref Scopus (2557) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, raft association may be involved in formation of caveolae and other types of endocytotic trafficking as well as in membrane signaling events. In the biosynthetic exocytotic pathway, raft association in the trans-Golgi network may be involved in formation of transport vesicles specifically targeted to the apical cell surface in epithelial cell types and to the axonal membrane in neuronal cells, but evidence indicates that the raft pathway may well be operating also in non-polarized cells (8.Müsch A. Xu H. Shields D. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 543-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 9.Yoshimori T. Keller P. Roth M.-G. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Rafts can conveniently be isolated from cells by virtue of their resistance to detergent solubilization at low temperature (1.Simons K. van Meer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6197-6202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar, 10.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Rafts, thus prepared from small intestine as “detergent-insoluble complexes” (also commonly referred to as DIGs or DRMs), were previously found to be highly enriched in several of the major brush border enzymes, including the transmembrane aminopeptidase N and sucrase-isomaltase (11.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) as well as the GPI1-anchored melanotransferrin (12.Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Likewise, in the enterocyte-like Caco-2 cell line, GPI-anchored proteins and sucrase-isomaltase were enriched in the raft fraction (13.Garcia M. Mirre C. Quaroni A. Reggio H. Le Bivic A. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1281-1290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Mirre C. Monlauzeur L. Garcia M. Delgrossi M.-H. Le Bivic A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C887-C894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have identified a member of the galectin family, galectin 4, to be associated with rafts, by forming clusters with the brush border enzymes (15.Danielsen E.M. van Deurs B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2241-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Recently we observed that the transcytotic route taken by IgA across the enterocyte passes through a raft containing compartment, most likely the apical endosome (16.Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Immerdal L. Hunziker W. Kenny A.J. Danielsen E.M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Together, these findings imply that raft formation may be of functional importance in the apical membrane trafficking occurring in intestinal epithelial cells. Cholesterol-sequestering agents, sometimes used in combination with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors such as lovastatin (17.Alberts A.W. Chen J. Kuron G. Hunt V. Huff J. Hoffman C. Rothrock J. Lopez M. Joshua H. Harris E. Patchett A. Monaghan R. Currie S. Stapley E. Albers-Schonberg G. Hensens O. Hirshfield J. Hoogsteen K. Liesch J. Springer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar), have been employed in a number of studies to characterize functionally membrane microdomains. Thus, low density lipoprotein deprivation caused a reduction in surface expression of the GPI-anchored gD1-DAF in MDCK cells, but the apical polarity was unaffected (18.Hannan L.A. Edidin M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1265-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Other types of cholesterol-sequestering agents such as filipin and cyclodextrins have been shown in several studies to disrupt caveolae and to inhibit non-clathrin-coated internalization of various ligands (19.Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar, 20.Orlandi P.A. Fishman P.H. J.

Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 369-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By using a combination of a rapid membrane cholesterol sequestering by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and cholesterol synthesis inhibition by lovastatin, an apical to basolateral missorting of the transmembrane influenza virus hemagglutinin was observed together with a reduced raft association (22.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). By using the same experimental approach, an axonal to dendritic missorting was observed for the GPI-anchored Thy-1 in cultured neuronal cells (23.Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). In the present work, methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin were used to study the effect of cholesterol depletion on the membrane trafficking of aminopeptidase N in enterocytes from mucosal explants. Compared with controls, the newly synthesized brush border enzyme was processed to its mature, complex glycosylated form and associated with rafts at a slower rate. In addition, an extensive vesiculation of the Golgi complex occurred together with an increased basolateral missorting. In contrast, the localization of a basolateral membrane protein, Na+/K+-ATPase, was unaffected by cholesterol depletion. Taken together, the results indicate a role for raft formation in the apical exocytotic membrane trafficking in enterocytes and implicate the Golgi complex as a key organelle in this process. Lovastatin was a kind gift from Alice Friis Petersen of Merck Sharp and Dohme (Glostrup, Denmark). Methyl-β-cyclodextrin was obtained from Sigma. Equipment for performing organ culture, including Trowell's T-8 medium and culture dishes with grids, was obtained as described previously (24.Danielsen E.M. Sjöström H. Norén O. Bro B. Dabelsteen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody to the α-subunit of human Na+/K+-ATPase was from Affinity Bioreagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). The rabbit antibodies to pig small intestinal aminopeptidase N used for immunogold electron microscopy and immunopurification were as described previously (25.Hansen G.H. Sjöström H. Norén O. Dabelsteen E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 43: 253-259PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Sjöström H. Norén O. Christiansen L.A. Wacker H. Semenza G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11332-11338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Segments of pig small intestine were kindly provided by Letty Klarskov and Mette Olesen from the Department of Experimental Medicine, the Panum Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark. After a rinse of the small intestinal segments in ice-cold Hanks' buffered salt solution, mucosal explants were excised and cultured in Trowell's T-8 medium for periods up to 4 h (24.Danielsen E.M. Sjöström H. Norén O. Bro B. Dabelsteen E. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For cholesterol depletion, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2%) was added either alone or together with 5 mm lovastatin. In some experiments, methyl-β-cyclodextrin-containing medium was preloaded with cholesterol prior to culture by incubation with 1% (w/v) free cholesterol for 24 h at 37 °C under constant shaking. After culture, the explants were either frozen quickly at −20 °C or immersed in fixative for electron microscopy. After culture, mucosal explants were fixed for ultrastructural analysis in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 msodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 2 h. For immunogold labeling the mucosal explants were fixed in either 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 2 h or in 2% paraformaldehyde and 3% glutaraldehyde in the above buffer for 15 min. After a rinse in the above buffer, the explants were prepared for electron microscopy according to standard procedure or infused with 2.3 msucrose at room temperature before storage in liquid nitrogen. Ultracryosectioning and immunogold single and double labeling was performed as described previously (16.Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Immerdal L. Hunziker W. Kenny A.J. Danielsen E.M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 610-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 27.Danielsen E.M. Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). For preparation of rafts from total membranes, explants of about 100 mg of wet weight were thawed in 1 ml of 25 mm HEPES-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, containing 10 μg of each of aprotinin and leupeptin, and homogenized in a manually operated Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 500 × g, 3 min, and then centrifuged at 48,000 × g, 30 min to obtain a pellet of total membranes. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of the above buffer, extracted with 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min on ice, and mixed with an equal volume of 80% sucrose in the same buffer. Low temperature detergent-insoluble complexes (rafts) were prepared according to Brown and Rose (10.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar), by layering a 5–30% sucrose gradient on top of the extract and centrifugation in an SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) for 20–22 h at 35,000 rpm (g max = 217,000), as described previously (11.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In some experiments, mucosal explants were fractionated by the divalent cation precipitation method into Mg2+-precipitated (intracellular and basolateral membranes) and microvillar membranes (28.Booth A.G. Kenny A.J. Biochem. J. 1974; 142: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar), as described previously (29.Danielsen E.M. Biochem. J. 1982; 204: 639-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE in 10% gels under reducing conditions was performed according to Laemmli (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The free cholesterol concentration in total mucosal explant membranes and sucrose gradient fractions was determined spectrophotometrically by a cholesterol oxidase/peroxidase assay (31.Gamble W. Vaughan M. Kruth H.S. Avigan J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1068-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (32.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Aminopeptidase N activity was determined spectrophotometrically using alanyl-p-nitroanilide as substrate (33.Sjöström H. Norén O. Jeppesen L. Staun M. Svensson B. Christiansen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), and the brush border enzyme was immunopurified from solubilized membrane fractions as described previously (27.Danielsen E.M. Hansen G.H. Niels-Christiansen L.-L. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1039-1050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, culture of mucosal explants for 2 h in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin caused a reduction in the cellular free cholesterol/protein ratio to less than 60% of the level of controls. When lovastatin was included as well, this ratio was further reduced to less than half the control value. TableII compares the cholesterol content of Mg2+-precipitated (intracellular and basolateral) membranes and microvillar membranes of cholesterol-depleted and control mucosal explants. As should be expected, microvillar membranes had the highest cholesterol content and, being directly exposed to methyl-β-cyclodextrin in the culture medium, were depleted to 36% of the controls. However, the cholesterol reduction was also substantial for the Mg2+-precipitated membranes (61% of the controls), indicating that also intracellular membranes of the enterocyte were affected by the treatment. As shown in Fig.1, about half the amount of cholesterol from a low temperature detergent extract of membranes of control explants floated in the upper fractions (fractions 5–9) after a sucrose gradient centrifugation. This indicates that a major fraction of the cellular cholesterol resides in detergent-resistant glycolipid/cholesterol microdomains or rafts (10.Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2618) Google Scholar). Culture for 2 h in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin markedly reduced the amount of cholesterol in the upper fractions of the gradient, indicating that cholesterol depletion affects the composition of glycolipid rafts. However, the fact that some cholesterol remained in the floating fractions following the depletion treatment also shows that rafts per se were not completely abolished by this treatment.Table ICholesterol depletion of mucosal explants by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatinExplantProteinCholesterolCholesterol/proteinmg/mlTop controlControl3.13 ± 0.300.334 ± 0.067100CD3.51 ± 0.210.213 ± 0.03258CD/lovastatin2.99 ± 0.490.145 ± 0.02546Explants were cultured for 2 h in the absence (control) or presence of 2% methyl-β-cyclodextrin alone (CD) or 2% methyl-β-cyclodextrin and 5 mm lovastatin (CD/lovastatin).

Culture of mucosal explants for 2 h in the presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin did not cause any major morphological changes in enterocytes (Fig.2). However, the microvillar length of the brush border was modestly reduced; measurements of 100 microvilli, taken from 20 views of control and cholesterol-depleted enterocytes, respectively, showed a reduction in microvillar length from 1.07 ± 0.16 to 0.84 ± 0.25 μm (Fig.3). The density of microvilli also appeared somewhat reduced and microvesiculation was frequently observed, but the microvilli otherwise appeared normal in shape including the actin cytoskeleton extending well into the underlying terminal web. In parallel cultures using methyl-β-cyclodextrin preloaded with free cholesterol, the microvillar length (0.98 ± 0.17 μm) and density resembled that of control enterocytes. The only intracellular changes in morphology caused by cholesterol depletion concerned the Golgi complex. Compared with those of control explants, the Golgi cisternae were often reduced in size and were surrounded by numerous vesicles, ranging in size from 100 to 200 nm (Fig. 3). In parallel cultures, methyl-β-cyclodextrin preloaded with cholesterol had no visible effect on the morphology of the Golgi complex, indicating that methyl-β-cyclodextrin by itself did not perturb the enterocytes (Fig. 3).Figure 3Microvilli and the Golgi complex are affected by cholesterol depletion. Electron micrographs of the brush border and Golgi complex areas of enterocytes from explants cultured in the absence (A and D) or presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (B and E) or methyl-β-cyclodextrin preloaded with free cholesterol prior to culture (C and F). Note that cholesterol depletion caused a moderate decrease in the length and density of microvilli and frequently induced microvillar microvesiculation. Intracellularly, the treatment caused an extensive vesiculation of the Golgi complex. None of these effects were observed with cholesterol-preloaded methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Bars, 0.5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) By immunogold electron microscopy, aminopeptidase N was seen in control enterocytes in the Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network, whereas labeling of the basolateral plasma membrane of mature enterocytes and of endosomes lying in proximity to this cell surface was very sparse, indicating a low steady-state concentration of aminopeptidase N in this region of the cell (Fig. 4). In enterocytes treated for 2 h with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin, the vesiculated Golgi complex was also labeled by the antibody to aminopeptidase N, and labeling along the enterocyte basolateral plasma membrane was markedly increased (Fig. 4), suggesting a missorting of the enzyme. To substantiate this, a morphometric analysis based on 100 views of controls and cholesterol-depleted explants, respectively, indicated that the labeling density over the basolateral plasma membrane increased from 1.4 gold particles/view in controls to 3.4 gold particles/view. Both aminopeptidase N as well as the basolateral marker Na+/K+-ATPase were observed in the Golgi areas of both control and cholesterol-depleted enterocytes (Fig.5). The aminopeptidase N labeling density over the Golgi complex and surrounding vesicles was not markedly affected by cholesterol depletion. However, a morphometrical analysis of 20 Golgi areas of control and cholesterol-depleted enterocytes, respectively, revealed a 2-fold increase in the overall size of the organelle (from a supranuclear cytoplasmic density of approximately 5–10%). This implies that an increased amount of newly synthesized brush border enzyme is present in the Golgi area. The numerous vesicles surrounding the Golgi complex in cholesterol-depleted cells were also labeled by antibodies to the Golgi markers β-COP (not shown) and K58 (Fig. 6), indicating that they are indeed derived from the Golgi membranes. In contrast to aminopeptidase N, Na+/K+-ATPase labeling over the brush border membrane remained very weak also in cholesterol-depleted enterocytes (Fig. 7), indicating that the treatment caused no missorting of this basolateral enzyme.Figure 5Colocalization of aminopeptidase N and Na+ /K+-ATPase in the Golgi area.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To study the effect of cholesterol depletion on Golgi-associated complex glycosylation and raft association, aminopeptidase N was immunopurified from the low temperature detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions of explants pulse-labeled for 1 h at 20 °C and chased for 0–90 min at 37 °C (Fig.9). At 20 °C membrane trafficking in enterocytes was almost completely arrested (34.Danielsen E.M. Hansen G.H. Cowell G.M. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 49: 123-127PubMed Google Scholar), and most of the newly synthesized aminopeptidase N appeared as the transient, high mannose-glycosylated form of 140 kDa in both control and cholesterol-depleted explants. During the chase at 37 °C, conversion to the mature, complex-glycosylated form of 166 kDa of the enzyme rapidly began and reached 60–70% by 90 min in control enterocytes. In comparison, complex glycosylation occurred at a slower rate in enterocytes treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin and was only about 40% by the end of the chase. Raft association (low temperature detergent insolubility) of the 166-kDa form only started to increase after 30 min of chase and was 40% for the control enterocytes by 90 min of chase, a value close to that previously reported for the enzyme at steady state (11.Danielsen E.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1596-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). As with complex glycosylation, raft association occurred more slowly in cholesterol-depleted enterocytes, reaching only 20% by the end of the chase. Fig.10 shows aminopeptidase N from Mg2+-precipitated and microvillar fractions of explants, labeled for 2 h. Compared with the control, a reduced amount of mature 166-kDa form was present in the microvillar fraction of cholesterol-depleted enterocytes, indicating an impaired transport to the apical cell surface. In conclusion, cholesterol depletion affects the rates of both Golgi-associated complex glycosylation and raft association of aminopeptidase N, and less of the newly synthesized enzyme is seen at the brush border by 2 h. Another raft-associated brush border enzyme, sucrase-isomaltase, was studied in parallel with aminopeptidase N, and the rates of complex glycosylation as well as raft association were similarly reduced for this enzyme (data not shown).Figure 9Cholesterol depletion reduces the rate of complex glycosylation and raft association of aminopeptidase N. A, mucosal explants were preincubated for 1 h at 20 °C in the absence (Control) or presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin (CD/lova). 0.5 mCi/ml [35S]methionine was then added to the media, and the culture at 20 °C continued for 1 h. After labeling, the explants were chased in non-radioactive medium at 37 °C for the indicated periods (still in the absence or presence of methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin, respectively). After culture, low temperature detergent-soluble (S) and -insoluble (I) fractions were prepared as described in the legend to Fig. 8, and aminopeptidase N was immunopurified from the two fractions and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Molecular weights (in kilodaltons) of transient, high mannose-glycosylated and mature, complex glycosylated forms (140 and 166 kDa, respectively) of aminopeptidase N are indicated.

The membrane fractions were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 25 mm HEPES-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and solubilized by 1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 37 °C.

Used either on its own or in combination with inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, a removal of free cellular cholesterol by 50% or more is usually achieved within a few hours of treatment but is reportedly increased by shaking of cells (in monolayer) or by placing cells in suspension (36.Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P.C. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16026-16034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Barred from these options, we consider the 50% reduction achieved by treatment for 2 h in the present work acceptable and probably near-optimal without compromising explant viability, as assessed by morphology as well as by protein biosynthesis. The enterocyte brush border membrane is rich in cholesterol, reportedly containing almost equimolar amounts of cholesterol and phospholipids (38.Wang H. Dudley Jr, A.W. Dupont J. Reeds P.J. Hachey D.L. Dudley M.A. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 1455-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and is the cell surface from where the main cholesterol efflux was observed to take place. This may account for the reduction in microvillar length and density caused by cholesterol depletion, but despite this the overall brush border architecture remained intact. In fact, the only intracellular membrane compartment visibly affected was the Golgi complex/trans-Golgi network, the central organelle in secretory membrane traffic and sorting (39.Farquhar M.G. Palade G.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 2-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 40.Mazzarello P. Bentaivoglio M. Nature. 1998; 392: 543-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Its complex functioning depends on small membrane-bound transport intermediates that shuttle proteins into and out of the stack of cisternae and associated tubules and vesicles. This membrane flux thereby determines the size and location of the Golgi complex, the dynamics of which has recently been magnificently visualized in a video essay compilation, making use of the green fluorescent protein technology (41.Presley J.F. Smith C. Hirschberg K. Miller C. Cole N.B. Zaal K.J.M. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1617-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Our observation that cholesterol depletion caused the appearance of a large number of Golgi-derived, aminopeptidase N-positive vesicles thus implies a disturbance of the normal steady-state membrane flux through the organelle. Likewise, the markedly increased localization of the brush border enzyme in the basolateral plasma membrane points to an erratic sorting in the trans-Golgi network. Since the Na+/K+-ATPase was not observed to be similarly mistargeted to the brush border, cholesterol depletion seems to affect primarily the apical membrane traffic. The incomplete removal of cholesterol by the treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lovastatin may explain why a less than complete block of carbohydrate processing, raft formation, and apical transport was achieved. Furthermore, by studies on model membranes, it has recently been demonstrated that raft formation is not prevented by removal of cholesterol in membranes having high concentrations (33%) of sphingolipids (6.Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Our results may reflect this fact since the sphingolipid content of pig intestinal brush border membranes is of similar magnitude (42.Christiansen K. Carlsen J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 647: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). At any rate, the results obtained argue in favor of a close relationship in the enterocyte between raft formation in the Golgi complex/trans-golgi network and apical exocytotic membrane trafficking. Since a similar relationship has recently been shown to exist in MDCK cells (22.Keller P. Simons K. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1357-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and cultured neurons (23.Ledesma M.D. Simons K. Dotti C.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3966-3971Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), evidence is accumulating that rafts play a general role as lateral sorting platforms for apically destined membrane traffic. The long standing question concerning the actual size of rafts in vivo has been addressed by two different approaches (43.Jacobson K. Dietrich C. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 87-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). By fluorescence resonance energy transfer and chemical cross-linking studies on GPI-anchored proteins, raft domains at the cell surface were estimated to be less than 70 nm in diameter (44.Varma R. Mayor S. Nature. 1998; 394: 798-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and to harbor only about 15 protein molecules per raft (45.Friedrichson T. Kurchalia T.V. Nature. 1998; 394: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). This is a much smaller size than rafts prepared by low temperature detergent extraction and well below the resolution power of fluorescence microscopy, explaining why clustering of GPI-anchored proteins at the cell surface in raft domains so far has been difficult to visualize. Still, much about rafts remains to be sorted out, including the structural clues (other than GPI anchors) that signal raft association. Some evidence indicates that carbohydrate-lectin interactions (46.Scheiffele P. Peranen J. Simons K. Nature. 1995; 378: 96-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), as well as the transmembrane domain (47.Scheiffele P. Roth M.G. Simons K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5501-5508Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), can serve this function, suggesting that raft localization may occur by several mechanisms. Another unsolved question concerns the molecular machinery involved in the budding of raft-containing vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and their subsequent docking and fusion with the apical cell surface (48.Weimbs T. Low S.H. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 393-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Ikonen et al.(49.Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) initially reported the apical trafficking in MDCK cells to occur independently of the SNARE mechanism and instead suggested a member of the annexin family, annexin XIIIb, to be involved. Other investigators have since described the transcytotic route from the basolateral to the apical surface of MDCK cells to rely on the SNARE machinery (50.Apodaca G. Cardone M.H. Whiteheart S.W. DasGupta B.R. Mostov K.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1471-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and have localized a member of the t-SNARE family, SNAP-23, to the apical (as well as the basolateral) surface of this cell type (51.Leung S.-M. Chen D. DasGupta B.R. Whiteheart S.W. Apodaca G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17732-17741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). More recently, other components of the SNARE machinery (syntaxin 3 and TI-VAMP) have been identified in apical carrier vesicles (52.Lafont F. Verkade P. Galli T. Wimmer C. Louvard D. Simons K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 30: 3734-3738Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar), indicating that the raft-associated apical route from thetrans-Golgi network after all relies on the “classical” molecular machinery for docking and fusion. Obviously, however, more work is needed before we have a satisfactory understanding of apical membrane trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W1998092533,"Abstract Targeting of ribosome–nascent chain complexes to the translocon in the endoplasmic reticulum is mediated by the concerted action of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the SRP receptor (SR). Ribosome-stripped microsomes were digested with proteases to sever cytoplasmic domains of SRα, SRβ, TRAM, and the Sec61 complex. We characterized protein translocation intermediates that accumulate when Sec61α or SRβ is inactivated by proteolysis. In the absence of a functional Sec61 complex, dissociation of SRP54 from the signal sequence is blocked. Experiments using SR proteoliposomes confirmed the assembly of a membrane-bound posttargeting intermediate. These results strongly suggest that the Sec61 complex regulates the GTP hydrolysis cycle of the SRP-SR complex at the stage of signal sequence dissociation from SRP54."
https://openalex.org/W2055159539,"Abstract The β-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger (CMI CC 324262) was purified, and an N-terminal sequence and two internal sequences were determined. BglI genomic gene and the cDNA were cloned from a genomic library and by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The cDNA was successfully expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae andPichia pastoris. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a 92-kDa enzyme that is a member of glycosidase family 3.1H-NMR analysis of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme confirmed that, in common with other family 3 glycosidases, this enzyme hydrolyzes with net retention of anomeric configuration. Accordingly, the enzyme was inactivated by 2-deoxy-2-fluoro β-glucosyl fluoride, with kinetic parameters of ki = 4.5 min−1, KI = 35.4 mm, through the trapping of a covalent glycosyl enzyme intermediate. The catalytic competence of this intermediate was demonstrated by the fact that incubation with linamarin resulted in reactivation, presumably via a transglycosylation mechanism. Peptic digestion of the 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl enzyme and subsequent analysis of high pressure liquid chromatography eluates by electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometry in the neutral loss mode allowed the localization of a 2-deoxy-2-fluoroglucosyl-peptide. Sequence determination of this labeled peptide by tandem mass spectrometry in the daughter ion scan mode permitted the identification of Asp-261 as the catalytic nucleophile within the sequence VMSDW. Asp-261 is fully conserved within this family, consistent with its key role, and aligns with the aspartic acid residue previously identified in theAspergillus wentii enzyme by labeling with conduritol B epoxide (Bause, E., and Legler, G. (1974) Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 355, 438–442)."

Recent evidence suggests that the activity and cell surface expression of a neuronal subtype of glutamate transporter, EAAC1, are rapidly increased by direct activation of protein kinase C and are decreased by wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). We hypothesized that this regulation could be analogous to insulin-induced stimulation of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter, which is dependent upon activation of PI3-K. Using C6 glioma, a cell line that endogenously and selectively expresses EAAC1, we report that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) increased Na+-dependentl-[3H]-glutamate transport activity within 30 min. This effect of PDGF was not due to a change in total cellular EAAC1 immunoreactivity but was instead correlated with an increase cell surface expression of EAAC1, as measured using a membrane impermeant biotinylation reagent combined with Western blotting. A decrease in nonbiotinylated intracellular EAAC1 was also observed. These studies suggest that PDGF causes a redistribution of EAAC1 from an intracellular compartment to the cell surface. These effects of PDGF were accompanied by a 35-fold increase in PI3-K activity and were blocked by the PI3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002, but not by an inhibitor of protein kinase C.

In fact, mice genetically deleted of EAAC1 excrete abnormally high levels of acidic amino acids in the urine, suggesting that this transporter mediates reabsorption of glutamate and aspartate from the glomerular filtrate (19.Peghini P.

Therefore, understanding the acute regulation of this transporter may help elucidate its function during excitatory transmission and excitotoxic events, as well as in peripheral glutamate metabolism.Recent studies demonstrate that the activity of several neurotransmitter transporters can be rapidly regulated by direct activation of intracellular signaling molecules (PKC or cAMP-dependent protein kinase), including norepinephrine (20.Apparsundaram S.

In many cases, the changes in activity are correlated with a redistribution of transporter protein from the cell surface to an intracellular compartment or vice versa. There is also evidence that some of these transporters are regulated by their substrates. For example, Bernstein and Quick (28.Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 889-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that GABA and other GABA transporter substrates increase the activity and cell surface expression of the GAT1 subtype of GABA transporter. Ramamoorthy and Blakely (29.Ramamoorthy S. Blakely R.D. Science. 1999; 285: 763-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) provide evidence that serotonin transporter substrates decrease PKC-dependent phosphorylation and internalization of the serotonin transporter. Little is known about receptor-mediated regulation of transporter function, but there is evidence that histamine and adenosine receptor activation regulate serotonin transporter function by an unknown mechanism (30.Launay J.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 27351-27356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that activation of G protein-coupled receptors causes a decrease in cell surface expression of the GAT1 subtype of GABA transporter in neurons (32.Beckman M.L. Bernstein E.M. Quick M.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: RC1-RC6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Angiotensin II and insulin may regulate norepinephrine transport in spontaneously hypertensive rats (33.Yang H. Raizada M.K. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SK-N-SH cells (34.Apparsundaram S. Blakely R.D. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1997; 23: 1132Google Scholar), respectively. Both of these effects appear to be dependent on PI3-K.We recently demonstrated that activation of PKC with phorbol ester increases the activity and cell surface expression of the EAAC1 subtype of glutamate transporter (27.Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Except for a PKC-induced increase in GAT1 cell surface expression observed in Xenopus oocytes (25.Quick M.W. Corey J.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), this increase in EAAC1 cell surface expression following PKC activation is unique. We also found that wortmannin, an inhibitor of PI3-K, decreased EAAC1 activity and cell surface expression. These regulated changes in activity and cell surface expression qualitatively resemble translocation events observed for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 (reviewed in Refs. 35.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar and 36.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The regulation of GLUT4 has been well studied and appears to be primarily mediated by activation of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase cascade and stimulation of PI3-K, although some studies suggest an additional role for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-sensitive PKCs.In the present study, the effects of growth factors on the activity of EAAC1 were examined using C6 glioma as a model system that selectively and endogenously expresses this subtype of transporter. Of the growth factors tested, only PDGF stimulated PI3-K activity and rapidly (within minutes) increased both the activity and cell surface expression of EAAC1. These three effects of PDGF were blocked by two different inhibitors of PI3-K. Although the effects of PDGF and phorbol ester on activity and cell surface expression of EAAC1 were not additive, a PKC inhibitor did not block the effects of PDGF. These studies strongly suggest that EAAC1 cell surface expression and activity can be regulated within minutes by two independent but converging signaling pathways. This regulation may provide a novel mechanism to limit extracellular glutamate accumulation in the central nervous system.DISCUSSIONThe goals of this study were to determine if receptor-mediated activation of PI3-K increases the activity and cell surface expression of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 and to determine if this effect is dependent on activation of PKC. Application of PDGF BB increased EAAC1-mediated l-[3H]glutamate uptake within 30 min and also caused a comparable increase in EAAC1 cell surface expression. The PDGF AA homodimer, a ligand selective for activation of PDGF receptors containing the α subunit, had no significant effect on l-glutamate transport activity. This suggests that the effects observed in the present study are due to activation of receptors containing the β subunit. This result contrasts with an earlier preliminary study of l-aspartate transport in human fibroblasts, which reported an increase in transport activity after PDGF AA but not PDGF BB treatment (61.Franchi-Gazzola R. Visigalli R. Bussolati O. Gazzola G.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352 (112): 119Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The transporter subtype regulated by PDGF AA and the mechanism mediating the increase in activity were not identified in this earlier study.Three lines of evidence reported in the present study suggest that the effects of PDGF were mediated by PI3-K. First, several growth factors mediate a variety of cellular responses in C6 glioma, including NGF, EGF, PDGF, and insulin (47.Wei J.-W. Yeh S.-R. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 48.Zhang W. Nakashima T. Sakai N. Yamada H. Okano Y. Nozawa Y. Neurol. Res. 1992; 14: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 49.Goya L. Feng P.T. Aliabadi S. Timiras P.S. Int. J. Dev.

Each of these growth factors have been directly demonstrated to activate the same major signaling pathways, PLC-γ, PI3-K, and MAP kinase, in a number of different cellular systems (52.Valenzuela C.F. Kazlauskas A. Weiner J.L. Brain Res. Rev. 1997; 24: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 57.Carpenter G. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 58.Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar, 62.Goya L. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 429: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). However, in the present study, only PDGF stimulated PI3-K activity, and only PDGF altered EAAC1-mediated transport activity and cell surface expression. The lack of PI3-K stimulation by the other growth factors tested implies that these receptors couple to different signaling pathways in C6 glioma that do not contribute to the regulation of EAAC1 activity. Second, the effects of PDGF on EAAC1-mediated glutamate uptake activity and cell surface expression were blocked by two different PI3-K inhibitors. Finally, the effects of PDGF were not blocked by inhibitors of other signaling pathways potentially activated by PDGF. These studies suggest that PKC and PI3-K independently regulate cell surface expression of EAAC1 and provide one of the first examples of growth factor-mediated trafficking of neurotransmitter transporters.The C6 glioma cell line was selected as a model system for these experiments because of its endogenous and selective expression of EAAC1, allowing examination of the transporter in isolation. C6 glioma are an undifferentiated cell line of central nervous system origin that express both neuronal (glutamic acid decarboxylase) and glial (glutamine synthetase and glial fibrillary acidic protein) markers (63.Segovia J.

Although neurons in culture might more closely mimic the cellular milieu observed in vivo, we find that four transporters (EAAC1, EAAT4, GLT-1, and GLAST) are expressed in these cultures. This expression of additional transporters may be due to glial contamination, as well as changes in transporter expression properties of neurons grown in culture (66.Brooks-Kayal A.R. Munir M. Jin H. Robinson M.B. Neurochem. Int. 1998; 33: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 67.Mennerick S. Dhond R.P. Benz A. Xu W. Rothstein J.D. Danbolt N.C. Isenberg K.E. Zorumski C.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 4490-4499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the pharmacology of transport activity in these cultures suggests that at least three of these transporters contribute to glutamate uptake activity (68.Munir, M., Correale, D. M., and Robinson, M. B. (2000) Neurochem. Int., in pressGoogle Scholar). Because there are no specific inhibitors of EAAC1-mediated transport activity, ongoing efforts are aimed at developing neuron-enriched cultures with minimal glial contamination for these studies. Although one might argue that the regulated trafficking of EAAC1 observed in C6 glioma is an artifact of the cell line, two studies have documented cytoplasmic as well as plasma membrane localization of EAAC1 in brain tissue (11.Rothstein J.D. Martin L. Levey A.I. Dykes-Hoberg M. Jin L. Wu D. Nash N. Kuncl R.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 713-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar, 12.Shashidharan P. Huntley G.W. Murray J.M. Buku A. Moran T. Walsh M.J. Morrison J.H. Plaitakis A. Brain Res. 1997; 773: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This cytoplasmic/intracellular localization is unique to the EAAC1 subtype of glutamate transporter (69.Chaudhry F.A. Lehre K.P. Campagne M.V.L. Ottersen O.P. Danbolt N.C. Storm-Mathisen J. Neuron. 1995; 15: 711-720Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) and suggests that there is an intracellular pool of EAAC1 that can be redistributed to the cell surface in vivo.The ability of PDGF to increase EAAC1 transport activity and cell surface expression in a PI3-K-dependent fashion qualitatively resembles the regulation of GLUT4 in the periphery. In 3T3-L1 adipocytes and several other model systems, insulin increases activity and cell surface expression of the GLUT4 subtype of glucose transporter (reviewed in Refs. 35.Czech M.P. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1865-1868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar and 36.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). As is observed for the effects of PDGF on EAAC1, these effects of insulin occur within minutes and are blocked by both wortmannin and LY 294002 (41.Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 42.Clarke J.F. Young P.W. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Holman G.D. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Although some earlier studies had not observed effects of PDGF on glucose transport, Wang et al. (70.Wang L. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) recently reported that PDGF rapidly induces a 6-fold increase in glucose transport using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a model system (for a discussion of earlier literature, see Ref. 70.Wang L. Hayashi H. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19246-19253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This increase in activity was correlated with an increase in cell surface expression of a myc-tagged GLUT4 transporter. As was observed in the present study, these effects of PDGF were accompanied by an increase in PI3-K activity and were blocked by wortmannin (100 nm), suggesting that the effects of PDGF on GLUT4 and EAAC1 may be comparable. Although qualitatively similar, a larger percentage of GLUT4 appears to be sequestered intracellularly, and insulin has a greater effect on glucose uptake activity and translocation (up to 20-fold) than is observed after PDGF stimulation of EAAC1 (reviewed in Refs. 36.Pessin J.E. Thurmond D.C. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J. Okada S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar and 71.Rice J.E. Livingstone C. Gould G.W. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that this quantitative difference in intracellular sequestration is related to differences intrinsic to EAAC1 and GLUT4, it is also possible that under different conditions EAAC1 is more effectively retained intracellularly. It has also been suggested that GLUT4 transporters are segregated into two intracellular compartments, a constitutively recycling pool and a rapidly regulated pool of transporters (72.Zorzano A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2593-2596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). One argument for two compartments is the observation that transferrin receptors, a marker of the endosomal recycling compartment, and GLUT4 do not always co-localize (73.Aledo J.C. Lavoie L. Vollchuk A. Keller S.R. Klip A. Hundal H.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 75.Hanpeter D. James D.E. Mol. Membr.

Trans. 1996; 24: 540-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In fact, a substantial portion of cytoplasmic EAAC1 does not co-localize with transferrin receptors in control and wortmannin-treated C6 glioma, suggesting that intracellular EAAC1 may also segregate to two distinct intracellular compartments. 2K. Sims and M. Robinson, unpublished observation. Together, these observations suggest many similarities between the regulated trafficking of EAAC1 and GLUT4.The two most common PI3-K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY 294002, both blocked the effects of PDGF on EAAC1 uptake activity and cell surface expression, but in the absence of PDGF these two compounds had different effects. Wortmannin decreased basal glutamate uptake and cell surface localization and reduced the effects of PDGF to similar levels below control. In contrast, LY 294002 alone did not affect basal glutamate transport or cause a reduction of cell surface immunoreactivity. Both wortmannin and LY 294002 decreased PI3-K activity to undetectable levels and blocked PDGF stimulation of PI3-K activity. The differential effect of wortmannin on EAAC1 activity and cell surface expression might be attributable to inhibition of alternate kinase targets, but the concentrations used in the present study are below the 200–300 nm IC50 values required for inhibition of these alternate targets (myosin light chain kinase and MAP kinase) (55.Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we demonstrated in an earlier study that wortmannin inhibits basal EAAC1-mediated uptake with an IC50 value of 15 nm, which is nearly identical to the IC50 value for inhibition of PI3-K (27.Davis K.E. Straff D.J. Weinstein E.A. Bannerman P.G. Correale D.M. Rothstein J.D. Robinson M.B. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2475-2485Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin and LY 294002 both interact with the p110 subunit of PI3-K but have different mechanisms of action (wortmannin is an irreversible inhibitor and LY 294002 is reversible) (55.Nakanishi S. Yano H. Matsuda Y. Cell. Signal. 1995; 7: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 56.Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although it is possible that this difference in mechanism may account for the selective effects of wortmannin, it seems more likely that this effect on baseline activity and cell surface expression is related to inhibition of a wortmannin-sensitive, LY 294002-insensitive isoform of PI3-K. Several new isoforms of PI3-K have been identified recently, but their sensitivities to wortmannin and LY 294002 have not been systematically evaluated (for review see Ref. 76.Zvelebil M.J. Macdougall L. Leevers S. Volinia S. Vanhaesebroeck B. Gout I. Panayotou G. Domin J. Stein R. Pages F. Koga H. Salin K. Linacre J. Das P. Panaretou C. Wetzker R. Waterfield M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). There are some isoforms that display differences in sensitivity to these inhibitors when compared with the “classical” mammalian PI3-K, p85/p110 PI3-K (77.Takegawa K. DeWals D.B. Emr S.D. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3745-3756Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 78.Virbasius J.V. Guilherme A. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

J. 1997; 326: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that multiple isoforms of PI3-K regulate different aspects of transporter trafficking. For example, a wortmannin-sensitive, LY 294002-insensitive PI3-K may be required for recycling of EAAC1 transporters through an intracellular compartment.In the present study, we also found that the effects of PDGF were not blocked by the PKC antagonist Bis II, and the stimulatory effects of PDGF and PMA were not additive. This could imply that both PKC and PI3-K increase EAAC1 activity through independent but converging pathways. Activation of PKC with phorbol esters also increases activity and/or cell surface expression of the GLUT4 glucose transporter (80.Nave B.T. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 81.Nishimura H. Simpson I.A. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 82.Vogt B. Muschack J.

Following this, UvrB is loaded onto the site of the damage, and the UvrA protein is released. The resulting UvrB-DNA preincision complex is bound by UvrC, leading to incision of the DNA at the fourth or fifth phosphodiester bond on the 3′ side of the damage. This 3′ incision is immediately followed by hydrolysis of the eighth phosphodiester bond at the 5′ side of the damage (for reviews see Refs.1.Sancar A. Annu. Rev.

In this paper we show that substitution R42A in UvrC abolishes 3′ incision.

Schoot Uiterkamp R. Zwijnenburg D.A. Goosen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) proteins have been described. UvrC(R42A) was expressed from plasmid pCA161, which was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of pBL12 (11.Zwetsloot J.C.M. Barbeiro A.P. Vermeulen W. Arthur H.M. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Backendorf C. Mutat. Res. 1986; 166: 89-98PubMed Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotide GACCTGAAAAAAGCGCTTTCCAGCTATTTC. The UvrC(R42A) protein was overproduced in the ΔuvrCstrain CS4927(12) and purified by the same procedure as the wild type UvrC protein. For the purification of UvrC (351–610) plasmid pCA137 was constructed in which the truncated UvrC protein fused to a His tag at its C terminus is expressed from the T7 promoter. The insert of pCA137 was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction with primers CAGTAACCATATGAGGGCGCGTTATCTGAAA and AGCGTAGCGGATCCTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTTTCAACGACCAGAAGAT using pBL12 as template. The polymerase chain reaction product was restricted with NdeI and BamHI (sites are underlined in the primers), and the resulting fragment was inserted in pET11a (13.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar). For overproduction of the truncated protein strain CS5434 was constructed by transferring the ΔuvrC::cam mutation from CS4927 (12.Brouwer J. Vollebregt L. van de Putte P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7703-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) into strain BL21::DE3 (13.Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar), by P1 transduction. CS5434 containing pCA137 was grown in LB until A 600 = 0.4 and 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added. After 2 h of induction the cells were collected. For the purification of the truncated UvrC protein the method described for wild type UvrC was adapted. After the phosphocellulose column, the proteins were loaded on a blue-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.1m KPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 25% glycerol. The truncated UvrC protein was eluted with a 0.1–1.0m KCl gradient in the same buffer. Samples containing UvrC were finally loaded on a Ni2+ column that was eluted with a 0–0.25 m imidazole gradient in 0.1 mKPO4 (pH 7.5), 0.5 m KCl, 25% glycerol. The DNA sequence of substrate G1 is shown in Fig. 1. Substrate G2 is substrate G1 with a single-stranded nick at the 3′ incision position. The cholesterol lesion was synthesized as a phosphoramidite-protected nucleoside building block as described. 2V. Monaco, K. I. Van de Wetering, N. J. Meeuwenoord, H. A. Van den Elst, H. R. Stuivenberg, R. Visse, G. F. Moolenaar, E. Verhoeven, N. Goosen, G. A. Van der Marel, and J. H. Van Boom, submitted for publication. Using automated oligonucleotide synthesis, this building block was directly introduced into DNA. For 5′ labeling 4 pmol of the cholesterol-containing oligo was incubated with 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase in 70 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 3 pmol of [γ-32P]ATP (7000 Ci/mmol, ICN). After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the reaction was terminated by incubation at 80 °C for 10 min in the presence of 20 mm EDTA. G1 was constructed by hybridizing 4 pmol each of the 50-mer top strand and the 50-mer bottom strand in the presence of 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. G2 was constructed by hybridizing the cholesterol-containing 31-mer, the adjacent 19-mer, and the 50-mer bottom strand. The substrates were purified from the nonincorporated nucleotides by G50 gel filtration in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl. The DNA substrates (40 fmol) were incubated with 2.5 nm UvrA, 100 nm UvrB, and 50 nm (mutant) UvrC in 20 μl of Uvr-endo buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm ATP) as described (14.Visse R. de Ruijter M. Brouwer J. Brandsma J.A. van de Putte P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7609-7617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the indicated times the reaction was terminated by adding 2 μl of 2 μg/ml glycogen followed by ethanol precipitation. The incision products were analyzed on a 15% acrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. The DNA substrates (40 fmol) were incubated with 2.5 nm UvrA, 100 nm UvrB, and 20 nm (mutant) UvrC in Uvr-endo buffer. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C, and the protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by loading the samples on a 3.5% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. The N-terminal region of the UvrC protein contains a region with similarity to the GIY-YIG family of intron-encoded homing endonucleases (Ref. 15.Aravind L. Walker D.R. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1223-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar and Fig. 2). It has been postulated that this region in the homing nucleases constitutes the catalytic domain, because amino acid substitutions of residues ArG27 or Glu75 in the I-TevI nuclease result in proteins that can bind a homing site substrate but no longer cleave this DNA (16.Derbyshire V. Kowalski J.C. Dansereau J.T. Hauer C.R. Belfort M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 247: 197-210Google Scholar, 17.Kowalski J.C. Belfort M. Stapleton M.A. Holpert M. Dansereau J.T. Pietrokovski S. Baxter S.M. Derbyshire V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2115-2125Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region of UvrC has a similar function we mutated the conserved residue Arg42 by replacing it with Ala. The UvrC(R42A) mutant protein behaved identically to the wild type protein during the purification procedure, indicating that the overall physical properties of the protein are not affected by the mutation. Incubation of the 3′ prenicked substrate G2 with UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC(R42A) resulted in a 5′ incision as efficient as with the wild type UvrC (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, the double-stranded substrate G1 was hardly incised with the mutant UvrC (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). The very low amount of incision observed with UvrC(R42A) appeared to be due to uncoupled 5′ incision (not shown). Low amounts of uncoupled 5′ incision have been observed also on a BPDE-modified DNA substrate (18.Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Taken together our results demonstrate that UvrC(R42A) is defective in 3′ but not in 5′ incision. The additional 5′ incision was also efficiently induced by the mutant UvrC. This damage-independent cleavage by UvrBC has been shown to use the same catalytic site of UvrC that is used for 5′ incision (3.Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34896-34903Google Scholar). Gel retardation analysis showed that UvrC(R42A) formed UvrBC-DNA complexes comparable with the wild type protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 2 and 3). Taken together, the results strongly indicate that residue Arg42 of UvrC is part of the catalytic site for 3′ incision, suggesting that the region that is homologous to the homing nucleases forms the catalytic domain. In Fig. 2 A a schematic representation of the UvrC protein is shown. All identified residues of the catalytic site for the 5′ incision reaction are located in the C-terminal half of the protein. This second half of UvrC also contains the DNA-binding domain that is homologous to ERCC1 and that has been shown to be important for 5′ incision (10.Moolenaar G.F. Schoot Uiterkamp R. Zwijnenburg D.A. Goosen N. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 462-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The proposed catalytic domain for the 3′ incision is in the N-terminal half together with the coiled-coil domain that interacts with UvrB. This domain has been shown to be essential for 3′ incision. The positions of the different domains suggest that UvrC might consist of two functional halfs, one for each incision event. To test this, we tried to overproduce and purify the two halfs of the protein separately. Attempts to purify the N-terminal part of UvrC, either spanning residues 1–243 or residues 1–350 were unsuccessful, because both truncated proteins formed insoluble aggregates in the cell (not shown). The C-terminal part, from residues 351 to 610, however, was successfully purified. As expected, because both the catalytic site and the UvrB-binding domain for 3′ incision are absent, substrate G1 was not incised at all by UvrC (351–610) (Fig.4 A, lane 2). Substrate G2, however, was efficiently incised at the 5′ incision position by the C-terminal half of the UvrC protein (Fig.4 B, lanes 6–8). The truncated UvrC protein did not induce the additional 5′ incision. This is in agreement with the observation that this damage-independent incision event requires the interaction between the coiled-coil domains of UvrB and UvrC (3.Moolenaar G.F. Bazuine M. van Knippenberg I.C. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34896-34903Google Scholar) because in UvrC (351–610) this interaction domain is lacking (Fig.2 A). The efficiency of the 5′ incision induced by the truncated UvrC protein was somewhat lower compared with that of wild type UvrC (Fig. 4 B). This might be due to the presence of the His tag fused to the C-terminal end of the mutant protein. On the other hand it cannot be excluded that the N-terminal half of UvrC contributes to the 5′ incision reaction, e.g. by stabilizing the conformation of the C-terminal half of the protein or by stabilizing the UvrBC-DNA complex. The efficient incision by the UvrC (351–610) mutant (50% in 10 min), however, demonstrates that all important determinants for 5′ incision are located in the C-terminal half of the protein. In the past it was shown that a fusion of the maltose-binding protein (MBP)3 with part of the UvrC gene containing the C-terminal 314 amino acids (Fig. 2 A) is capable of complementing for UV sensitivity in vivo (19.Lin J.-J. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6824-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The same protein was shown to even induce 3′ incision in vitro, albeit at only about 1% of wild type UvrC activity. These observations are contradictory to the results presented here, because the MBP fusion protein is not only lacking the catalytic domain for 3′ incision, as identified in this paper, but also the coiled-coil domain for interaction with UvrB. The only way to explain the results reported for the MBP fusion protein is that both the in vivo studies and the protein overexpression for the in vitro studies were done in an E. coli strain that expresses a partially active UvrC protein from the chromosome. The E. coli strain used in the MBP fusion studies contained uvrC279::Tn10, which has a Tn10 insertion in the 3′ half of uvrC. As a result this strain might produce a truncated UvrC protein that still has all the domains for 3′ incision and that might therefore still incise damaged DNA at the 3′ side. The lack of the C-terminal part prevents subsequent 5′ incision, and hence the strain is deficient for repair. The introduced MBP fusion protein, however, which like UvrC (351–610) is expected to be fully active in 5′ insertion, can complete the repair reaction, and as a result UV resistance is restored. The observed incision in vitro could then be explained by a co-purification of the chromosome-encoded Uvr fragment with the MBP fusion protein. In the eukaryotic nucleotide excision repair system, the 3′ and 5′ incisions are made by different proteins (20.O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D. Nature. 1994; 371: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 21.Sijbers A.M. de Laat W.L. Ariza R.R. Biggerstaff M. Wei Y.F. Moggs J. Carter K.C. Shell B.K. Evans E. de Jong M.C.

In this paper we show that the two incisions in the E. coli system are induced by the same protein but that for each incision event distinct protein domains are used. This suggests that also in the ancestral bacterial repair system the two incisions were induced by two different proteins and that most likely during evolution these two proteins have fused into one."

In particular, CD98 interacted with the ubiquitous β1A but not the muscle-specific splice variant, β1D, or leukocyte-specific β7 cytoplasmic domains.

Complementation of dominant suppression (CODS)1 is an expression cloning scheme used to identify proteins that modulate integrin affinity (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). CODS depends on the ability of an isolated integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain, in the form of a chimera with the α subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, to block integrin activation (dominant suppression). Proteins involved in integrin activation are isolated by their ability to complement dominant suppression. CD98, a type II transmembrane protein first discovered as a T-cell activation antigen (11.Haynes B.F. Hemler M.E. Mann D.L. Eisenbarth G.S. Shelhamer J. Mostowski H.S. Thomas C.A. Strominger J.L.

The mechanism by which CD98 influences integrin function is not yet clear. CODS was predicated on the idea that it would identify integrin β cytoplasmic domain binding proteins (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Many β cytoplasmic domains manifest overall sequence similarity (1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar, 2.Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar); however, the cytoskeletal protein, talin, binds to the muscle-specific splice variant, β1D, more tightly than to β1A. In addition, the leukocyte-specific β7 cytoplasmic domain binds to filamin more tightly than to β1A (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). We have now examined interactions between CD98 and recombinant parallel-dimerized integrin β1A, β1D, and β7 cytoplasmic domains by affinity chromatography (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Here we report that CD98 interacts with the β1A but not β1D or β7 integrin cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, the CD98 interaction is insensitive to β cytoplasmic domain mutations that abolish the binding of talin and filamin. The capacity of CD98 to complement dominant suppression correlates with its capacity to bind to the suppressive β cytoplasmic domains. The interaction of the integrin β1A cytoplasmic domain with CD98 may thus serve to regulate the localization and the function of these membrane proteins. The hybridoma cell line 4F2(C13) (anti-CD98) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The CD98 antibody was purified from ascites produced in pristane-primed BALB/c mice by protein A affinity chromatography.

P Stossel) were cultured in Eagle's medium (BioWhitaker), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Jurkat cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and surface-biotinylated using Sulfo-BiotinN-hydroxysuccinimide in phosphate-buffered saline according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). They were then washed twice with Tris-buffered saline and lysed by sonication on ice in buffer A (1 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, 150 mmsucrose, pH 6.8) containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Platelet lysates were prepared as described previously (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of Jurkat cells was performed after surface biotinylation. The cells were washed three times in Hepes-saline (200 mm Hepes, 12 mmCaCl2·2H2O, 16 mmMgSO4, pH 7.3–7.4), suspended in 20 mm Hepes, and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. An equal quantity of buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 0.5 m sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm CaCl2·H2O with protease inhibitors) was added to the homogenate, and the mixture was centrifuged at 500 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 100 000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman model L7-65 centrifuge. The cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) was removed and the membrane fraction (pellet) washed in a 1:1 mixture of 20 mm Hepes and buffer B. The membrane fraction was resuspended in buffer A, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors and centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 20 min. Recombinant proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) and bound to His-bind resin (Novagen) through their N-terminal His tag in a ratio of 1 ml of beads/liter of culture. Coated beads were washed with PN (20 mm Pipes, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.8) and stored at 4 °C in an equal volume of PN containing 0.1% NaN3. Beads were added to cell lysates diluted in buffer A, (0.05% Triton X-100, 3 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors) and incubated overnight at 4 °C and then washed five times with buffer A. 100 μl of SDS-sample buffer was added to the beads and the mixture was heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After 10,000 rpm centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting. In some experiments, proteins were eluted off the beads with 100 μl of elution buffer (1 mimidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9) and 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm benzamidine HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween 20, and protease inhibitors) was then added. The eluted proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with an 4F2 antibody pre-bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following day, the beads were washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer and heated in reducing sample buffer for SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Samples were separated on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 5% nonfat milk powder and stained with streptavidin-peroxidase or with specific antibodies and appropriate peroxidase conjugates. Bound peroxidase was detected with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equal loading of Ni2+ beads with recombinant proteins were verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE profiles of SDS eluted proteins. Analytical two-color flow cytometry was performed as described previously (9.O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R.N. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). PAC1 binding was assessed in a subset of transiently transfected αβpy cells (cells positive for co-transfected Tac-α5 as measured by 7G7B6 binding). Integrin activation was quantified as an activation index (AI) defined as (F−Fo)/(F LIBS6 −Fo), in which F is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding, Fo is the median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of competitive inhibitor (Ro43-5054, 1 μm), andF LIBS6 is the maximal median fluorescence intensity of PAC1 binding in the presence of the integrin activating antibody anti-LIBS6 (2 μm). Percentage of reversal is calculated as (AI (βx + CD98) −AI βx)/(AI α5− AI βx).AI βx is the activation index of cells transfected with Tac-βx chimeras,AI (βx + CD98) is the AIof cells co-transfected with CD98 and Tac βxchimeras, and AI α5 is the AI of cells transfected with Tac-α5. The x of βx can have values of 1A, 1D, and 7 for the Tac-β1A, Tac-β1D, and Tac-β7chimeras, respectively. CD98 can block reduced integrin affinity caused by overexpression of free β1A cytoplasmic domains, suggesting a physical interaction between β1A and CD98 (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). To assess this potential interaction, we examined the binding of solubilized membrane proteins to the β1A cytoplasmic domain. For affinity matrices, we used model proteins in which the integrin cytoplasmic domain was joined to four heptad repeats (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The repeats form parallel coiled-coil dimers so that the tails are dimerized and parallel. When a Jurkat cell lysate was exposed to such an affinity matrix, a cell surface polypeptide of 88 kDa bound to the β1A but not to the αIIb tail (Fig.2 A). This polypeptide was immunoprecipitated by the anti-CD98 antibody, 4F2 (Fig. 2 B). Based on its mass and reactivity with anti-CD98 antibody, the β1A tail binding polypeptide was identified as CD98. To assess the specificity of CD98 binding to β integrin tails, affinity chromatography was performed with β1D, β3, and β7 cytoplasmic domains. CD98 did not bind to β7 and binding to β1D was weak and variable (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, talin and filamin (Fig. 3 A) bound strongly to β1D and β7 tails, respectively, as reported (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). CD98 also bound to β3, and binding was not altered by the presence of the αIIb cytoplasmic domain (Fig.3 B). Thus, CD98 binding to integrin tails is integrin class- and splice-variant-specific. CD98 binds well to the β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain but not to those of β1D or β7. The binding assays were performed using talin- and filamin-1-containing cell extracts. Thus, these CD98 binding differences could be due to competition for CD98 binding by filamin-1 or talin, which bind preferentially to β7 or β1D, respectively (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). To test this possibility, we used filamin-1-deficient human melanoma cells (M2) and reconstituted cells (A7) (27.Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) to examine the role of filamin-1 in CD98 binding. CD98 bound to the β1A tail, but not β7, when lysates of M2 cells were used (Fig.4 A), showing that filamin-1 is not required for CD98 binding to β1A. CD98 binding to β7 was not observed in the filamin-1 null (M2) cells. Consequently, competition with filamin-1 does not account for the failure of β7 to bind CD98. To examine the role of talin, we used cell membrane preparations with a greatly reduced talin content (Fig.5 A). CD98 extracted from these membranes bound β1A but not β1D cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 5 B). Thus, talin does not prevent CD98 binding to β1D, nor is it required for CD98 binding to β1A. The Y788A mutation of β1A (Fig. 1) disrupts filamin (Fig.4 B) and talin (Fig. 5 C) binding (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similar Tyr to Ala mutations in β7 and β1D tails, corresponding to the Y788A mutation in β1A (Fig. 1), also disrupted filamin (Fig. 4 B) and talin (Fig. 5 C) binding. CD98 binding to β integrin tails was not affected by Tyr to Ala mutations (Figs. 4 B and 5 C). The Tyr to Ala mutation introduced into β1D or β7 did not increase CD98 binding, nor was CD98 binding reduced in the β1A(Y788A) mutant. These results confirm that talin or filamin competition does not account for the lack of CD98 binding to β1D and β7 and that talin or filamin binding is not required for CD98 binding to the β1Acytoplasmic domain. Overexpression of isolated integrin β1A cytoplasmic domains, in the form of a Tac-β1A chimera, results in suppression of integrin activation. Dominant suppression is reversed by overexpression of CD98 (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Tac-β1A, Tac-β1D, and Tac-β7 induced dominant suppression of integrin activation (Fig. 6 A). As noted above (Fig. 3), CD98 bound poorly to β1D and β7 tails, showing that CD98 binding is not required for dominant suppression. However, CD98 was much less effective at reversing the suppression induced by Tac-β1D and Tac-β7 (Fig. 6 B). Thus the capacity of CD98 to rescue suppression correlates with its binding to the suppressive β cytoplasmic domain. As noted above, β1A tails suppress integrin activation and bind CD98. To assess whether CD98 binding alone is sufficient to induce dominant suppression, we first examined CD98 binding to a series of β1A truncation mutants (Fig. 1). CD98 binding was lost when the C-terminal seven residues were deleted (β1AC797X)) but not when the last three amino acids were eliminated (β1A(801X)) (Fig.7 A). Despite maintaining its capacity to bind to CD98, the Tac-β1A(801X) mutant was a poor suppressor of integrin activation (Fig. 7 B), and this was not due to a quantitative reduction in the association of CD98 with β1A(801X) (Fig. 7 C). Furthermore, the β1A(Y788A) mutant, which also bound CD98 (Figs. 4 and 5), failed to suppress integrin activation (Fig. 7 B). Consequently, integrin β cytoplasmic domain binding to CD98 is not sufficient to induce dominant suppression. CD98 is implicated in several cellular functions, including amino acid transport, cell fusion events, and integrin activation (12.Diaz Jr., L.A. Fox D.A. J. Biol. Reg. Homeostat. Agents. 1998; 12: 25-32PubMed Google Scholar). We previously found that CD98 reverses dominant suppression of integrin function (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We now report that: 1) CD98 associates with the β1A integrin cytoplasmic domain; 2) CD98 interacts differentially with β cytoplasmic tails in a class- and splice variant-specific manner, which is independent of the capacity of the tails to bind the cytoskeletal proteins talin and filamin; 3) CD98's capacity to associate with integrin tails correlates with its ability to overcome dominant suppression of integrin activation; 4) CD98 association with integrin tails is neither necessary nor sufficient for dominant suppression of integrin activation. Thus, the association of CD98 with integrin cytoplasmic domains may regulate the function and localization of these membrane proteins. CD98 physically associates with β1A integrin cytoplasmic domains. This association was observed utilizing model protein mimics of dimerized integrin cytoplasmic tails, and it may account for the physical association of certain β1 integrins with CD98. 2M. Hemler, personal communication. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by the lack of binding to mimics containing cytoplasmic domains from αIIb or several other β subunits. CD98 was added to the tails in the presence of other cellular proteins, so it remains possible that an intermediary protein is required for this interaction. However, CD98 was the only surface protein observed binding to the β1A tail (Fig. 2). Moreover, we observed CD98 binding in the absence of two known integrin binding proteins, talin and filamin (Figs. 3 and 4). CD98 failed to bind to β1D and β7 cytoplasmic domains, even though these tails bind many of the same polypeptides as β1A (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude that CD98 associates with the β1A tail and that the interaction is potentially direct. CD98 binds to integrin β cytoplasmic domains with unique splice variant and class specificity. CD98 bound well to the β1Atail and the β3 tail. Binding to the β1Dand β7 tails was negligible. The specificity of CD98 binding differs markedly from the specificity of talin and filamin binding, since talin binds preferentially to the β1D tail and filamin to the β7 tail (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Moreover, the binding of both cytoskeletal proteins is sensitive to the Tyr substitution with Ala in the first “NPXY” (21.Pfaff M. Liu S. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) in β1A and, as shown here, in β7 and β1D. Strikingly, CD98 binding was insensitive to this mutation. Finally, although the last three residues of β1A were dispensable, the last seven residues were required for binding. Thus, the features of the β tail defined here for CD98 binding identifies a novel structural specificity for integrin β tail function. CD98 binding to β tails correlates with its capacity to complement dominant suppression. CD98 was implicated in integrin activation by its capacity to reverse the suppression of integrin activation caused by an isolated β1A cytoplasmic domain (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the present work, we found that CD98 binds to the β1A cytoplasmic domain, but fails to bind well to the β7 or β1D cytoplasmic domain. Strikingly, CD98 failed to complement dominant suppression initiated by either β7 or β1D cytoplasmic domains. Consequently, the mechanism of CODS appears to involve CD98 binding to the suppressive β tail. Furthermore, cross-linking of CD98 stimulates integrin α3β1-dependent adhesion in small cell lung cancer cells (10.Fenczik C.A. Sethi T. Ramos J.W. Hughes P.E. Ginsberg M.H. Nature. 1997; 370: 81-85Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and in certain breast cancer cell lines (28.Chandrasekaran C. Guo N. Rodrigues R.G. Kaiser J. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

Thus, our finding that CD98-β1cytoplasmic domain interactions correlate with effects on integrin function is relevant to integrin-dependent events involved in mulinucleate giant cell formation, virally induced cell fusion, and regulation of cell adhesion. The physical interaction of CD98 with integrin cytoplasmic domains may be involved in modulating amino acid transport regulation. CD98 is known to regulate y+L and L type amino acid transport (14.Kanai Y. Segawa H. Miyamoto K. Uchino H. Takeda E. Endou H. J. Biol.

This regulation is probably due to disulfide-bonded heterodimer formation with a variety of light chains, that resemble permease amino acid transporters (13.Mannion B.A. Kolesnikova T.V. Lin S.W.

Genet. 1999; 21: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). CD98 may function to regulate both the expression and localization of its light chains (18.Pfeiffer R. Rossier G. Spindler B. Meier C. Kuhn L. Verrey F. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In certain cells CD98 has a basolateral localization (38.Nakamura E. Sato M. Yang H. Miyagawa F.

Chem. 1999; 274: 3009-3016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). β1A integrins also manifest basolateral polarization in many cells (39.Simon E.E. Liu C.H. Das M.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar), probably due to interactions with underlying matrix components (41.Rahilly M.A. Fleming S. J. Pathol. 1993; 170: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) or recruitment to lateral cell contacts (42.Hodivala K.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that β7integrins are primarily involved in lymphocyte homing and β1D integrins primarily form mechanical linkages in striated and cardiac muscle (43.Belkin A.M. Zhidkova N.I. Balzac F. Altruda F. Tomatis D. Maier A. Tarone G. Koteliansky V.E. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 44.Belkin A.M. Retta S.F.

Thus, the failure of these cytoplasmic domains to bind to CD98 correlates well with their lack of a role in establishing polarity in epithelial or mesenchymal cells. Consequently, the physical association of CD98 with β1Aintegrin cytoplasmic domains may participate in the polarization and regulation of amino acid transporters and to modulate the function of certain integrins.

Crucial roles of apoptosis have thus been extended to morphogenesis, tissue homeostasis, immune regulation, and the elimination of infected, mutated, or damaged cells (1.Saunders J.W. Science. 1966; 154: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 2.Thompson C.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6170) Google Scholar, 3.Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2392) Google Scholar). In this context, the brain represents one of the most intriguing systems since apoptotic cell death is involved both in organ remodeling during development and also in the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases (4.Rubin L.L. Br. Med. Bull. 1997; 53: 617-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Programmed cell death proceeds through a well established program consisting of initiation and execution phases involving intrinsic, evolutionarily highly conserved molecular components (5.Ashkenazi A. Science. 1998; 281: 1301-1326Crossref Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 6.Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1980; 68: 251-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (6696) Google Scholar, 7.Ellis R.E. Yuan J.Y. Horwitz H.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 663-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the triggering signals and the metabolic requirements necessary for the initiation step may vary in diverse cell types. NO,1 a potentially oxidant radical, may be considered unique among the regulators of apoptosis since it can function either as a pro- or an antiapoptotic agent (8.Kim Y.M. Bombeck C.A. Billar T.R. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 253-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). NO is physiologically produced by NO synthases in various cellular types including endothelial cells and neurons, and it acts as a pleiotropic messenger molecule regulating blood flow and cellular signaling (9.Rees D.D. Palmer R.M. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3375-3378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 10.Furchgott R.F. Zawadzki J.V. Nature. 1980; 288: 373-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (9899) Google Scholar). It is also a component of the nonspecific host defense against tumor cells and pathogens (11.Moncada S. Palmer R.M. Higgs E.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 109-142PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Nathan C. Xie Q.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 915-918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). However, many studies suggested that NO production is associated with several neuropathological processes (13.Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying NO-mediated toxicity are not yet clearly understood, and it is suggested that they differ from those involved in its physiological actions and may involve multiple pathways depending on the cell type and on the mode of cell death, i.e. necrosisversus apoptosis.NO-mediated apoptosis involves the same interplay between the regulatory proteins that seems to control the execution of mammalian apoptosis (14.Brune B. Knethen V.A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Among these, the protein product of bcl-2protooncogene plays a pivotal role in apoptosis by regulating cytochrome c efflux from mitochondria, which in turn activates cysteine proteases (caspases) ultimately leading to specific DNA fragmentation. Constitutive expression of high Bcl-2 protein levels by transfection experiments has proven that Bcl-2 or related family members can protect from NO-mediated apoptosis (15.Srivastava R.K.

The tumor suppressor gene product p53 is able to modulate apoptosis in DNA-damaged cell (17.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), through a mechanism scarcely understood, and it has been suggested to play a functional role during NO-induced apoptosis (18.Forrester K. Ambs S. Lupold S.E. Kapust R.B. Spillare E.A. Weinberg W.C. Felley-Bosco E. Wang X.W. Geller D.A. Tzeng E. Billiar T.R. Harris C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Int. 1998; 32: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).NO-mediated toxicity may rely on secondary products derived from a large variety of nonenzymatic reactions between NO and cellular components such as thiols, metals, or superoxide (O⨪2). Several studies suggest that the proapoptotic effect of NO is a result of the formation of peroxynitrite from the nearby diffusion-controlled reaction between NO and O⨪2 (20.Estevez A.G. Radi R. Barbeito L. Shin J.T. Thompson J.A. Beckman J.S. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 21.Szabo C. Day B.J. Salzman A.L. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22.Beckman J.S. Lancaster J. Nitric Oxide: Principle and Actions. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). In neurons the target of peroxynitrite has been identified only partially; possible cytotoxic mechanisms involve DNA and mitochondrial damage (13.Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). However, in cell systems such as mesangial cells or macrophages, it was demonstrated that whereas the balanced and simultaneous generation of both radicals is non-destructive, the unopposed generation of either NO or O⨪2 induces apoptosis and, at high concentrations, necrotic cell death (23.Brune B. Gotz C. Messmer U.K. Sandau K. Hirvonen M.-R. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7253-7258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). From these observations it is possible to hypothesize that the milieu of intracellular antioxidants may modulate NO toxicity.The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) may play a fundamental role in modulating NO toxicity, since it acts as an antioxidant, dismutating O⨪2. As matter of fact, cells producing an increased amount of SOD were resistant to NO-mediated toxicity (24.Brockhaus F. Brune B. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In contrast, increase of O⨪2 levels by down-regulation of Cu,Zn-SOD led to NO-mediated apoptotic cell death (25.Troy C.M. Derossi D. Prochiantz A. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 253-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that Cu,Zn-SODs carrying mutations associated with the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (FALS) are pro-apoptotic agents, although they retain enzymatic SOD activity (26.Morrison B.M. Morrison J.H. Brain Res. Rev. 1999; 29: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar).In an attempt to understand the role of Cu,Zn-SOD as a determinant of NO-mediated toxicity in neuronal cells, we studied the susceptibility of a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) to NO donors in comparison with the same cells transfected with a fully active mutant or with a wild type Cu,Zn-SOD. In particular, we study the molecular mechanisms involved in GSNO-mediated apoptosis, since it has been demonstrated recently that it can be physiologically produced from commercially available pure NO-releasing agents (27.Inoue K. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Okamoto T. Sawa T. Otagiri M. Suzuki S. Yoshimura T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27069-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The results obtained showed that GSNO-mediated apoptosis in these cells is associated with a canonical sequence of events including Bcl-2, p53, and p21 modulation, cytochrome c release in the cytosol, and caspase 3 activation. Cells carrying wild type SOD are protected from NO-mediated apoptosis, whereas cells transfected with the mutant SOD are more susceptible.Our results point to the antioxidant activity of Cu,Zn-SOD as a regulator of NO-mediated apoptosis in neuronal cells; however, the gain of other functions due to mutations overwhelms beneficial effect amplifying NO toxicity. The overall results provide an explanatory mechanism for the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases showing apoptosis and in particular of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPuromycin (3′-[α-amino-p-methoxhydrocinnamamido]-3′-deoxy-N,N-dimetiladenosine) dihydrochloride, d(−)-penicillamine (d-(−)-2-amino-3-mercapto-3-methylbutanoic acid hydrochloride), Hepes, CHAPS, PIPES, Me2SO (dimethyl sulfoxide), d-mannitol, EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture, dithiothreitol (DTT), sulfanilamide (p-aminobenzenesulfonamide), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,N-(1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, bathocuproinedisulfonic acid, monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 clone Bcl-2-100, monoclonal anti-p53 clone BP53-12, and cytochrome c (horse heart) were obtained from Sigma. Ac-DEVD-AMC, caspase 3 inhibitor I (Ac-DEVD-CHO), Hoechst 33342, diethylamine NONOate (NONO), and 3-[(±)-(E)-ethyl-2′-[(E)-hydroxyimino]-5-nitro-3-exenecarbamoyl]pyridine (NOR-4) were purchased from Calbiochem. Anti-cytochrome cmonoclonal antibody (clone 7H8.2c12) was from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-p21 (C-19)-G polyclonal antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L)-horseradish peroxidase conjugate was from Bio-Rad. Supersignal substrate chemiluminescence reagent was from Pierce. 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Reduced and oxidized glutathione were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. All other chemicals were obtained from Merck.Cell CultureHuman neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Culture and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum, at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. Monoclonal cell lines transfected either with human wild type Cu,Zn-SOD (named WT) or with a mutated SOD G93A (named G93A) were obtained as described previously (28.Carrı̀ M.T. Ferri A. Battistoni A. Famhy L. Gabbianelli R. Poccia F. Rotilio G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 365-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Transfected cells had the same antioxidant pattern, such as of Mn-SOD, as SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were routinely trypsinized and plated at 30 × 105/75-cm2 flasks. Cell viability for all cell lines was assessed by trypan blue exclusion.TreatmentsS-Nitrosoglutathione was synthesized as described previously (29.Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Briefly, glutathione was dissolved in HCl at 4 °C and treated with an equimolar amount of NaNO2. The mixture was stirred for 40 min and subsequently treated with cold acetone. The precipitate was collected, washed, and dried under vacuum. Freshly synthesized GSNO was characterized by UV spectroscopy and sterilized by filtration. GSNO solutions were prepared just before the experiment. Treatments were performed with different amount of GSNO ranging from 0.025 to 1 mm for 48 h at 37 °C in medium supplemented with serum. The effect was dose-dependent between 0.1 and 1 mm (not shown). The concentration of 0.2 mm GSNO was selected for all the experiments since at this concentration the degree of apoptosis was well quantified for the three cell lines and avoided accumulating cells that underwent secondary necrosis in G93A cells. Diethylamine NONOate (NONO) and NOR-4 were used at concentration of 0.5 mm, and due to the rapid half-life of these compounds (16 min for NONO and 60 min for NOR-4) we treated the cells for 15 h. Moreover, analysis of apoptosis at 24 or 48 h did not show further increase of the extent of apoptosis.Puromycin was used at concentration of 5 μg/ml in medium supplemented with serum for 24 h at 37 °C. d-Penicillamine or bathocuproine was used at concentration of 100 μm for 24 h. This concentration was selected because it was not toxic for the cells during the treatment period, as stated by staining with the vital dye trypan blue.For detection of intracellular ROS, cells were incubated with 50 μm DCF-DA (dissolved in Me2SO) for 30 min at 37 °C. In the case of GSNO, cells were treated with GSNO for 15 h at 37 °C and then incubated with DCF-DA for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. After chilling on ice, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl pH 7.4), scraped from the plate, and resuspended in PBS containing 10 mm EDTA. The fluorescence intensities of 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein formed by the reaction of DCF-DA with ROS of more than 10,000 viable cells from each sample were analyzed by recording FL-1 fluorescence by a flow cytometer. Prior to data collection, propidium iodide was added to the sample for gating out dead cells. 100 μm tert-butylhydroperoxide treatment was used as a positive control. Experiments were repeated at least four times with similar results. The data are expressed as one representative histogram. The time course of these experiments was shortened at 15 h to avoid GSNO-treated cells from detaching from the plates.Analysis of ApoptosisNuclear fragmentation was detectable by optical microscopy either on slides of hematoxylin-stained cells or by vital staining with the DNA-specific cell-permeable dye Hoechst 33342; cell blebbing was detectable on detached cells by phase contrast microscopy as the modification of cell shape was from nearly round to blackberry-like. The fraction of cells with fragmented nuclei among the total cell population was calculated in the Hoechst 33342-stained cells, counting at least 300 cells in at least 10 random-selected fields as described (30.Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Attached apoptotic cells were detected with the fluorescence microscope directly on the flasks by analysis of nuclear fragmentation after staining with Hoechst 33342 dye as described (30.Ghibelli L. Fanelli C. Rotilio G. Lafavia E. Coppola S. Colussi C. Civitareale P. Ciriolo M.R. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 479-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Alternatively, attached (after trypsinization) and detached cells were combined, washed in PBS, and stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodide prior to analysis by a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Josè, CA).Preparation of Cell Lysates and Western Blots AnalysesCytosolic Cytochrome c DeterminationCells (detached and attached) were washed with PBS and collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing 220 mmmannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitors (31.Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar). After 30 min incubation on ice, cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce. Cell homogenates were spun at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C, until analysis by gel electrophoresis. 50 μg of cytosolic protein extracts were loaded onto each lane of a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, separated, and then blotted to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Purified cytochrome c from horse heart was used as standard. Purified mouse anti-cytochrome cmonoclonal antibody was used as primary antibody (1:5000). The specific protein complex formed upon appropriate secondary antibody treatment (1:10,000) was identified using the “SuperSignal” substrate chemiluminescence reagent.p53, p21, and Bcl-2 Proteins DetectionCell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% (octyphenoxy)polyethoxyethanol (IGEPAL CA-630, Sigma), and protease inhibitors. After 30 min incubation on ice, cells were disrupted by 30 s sonication. Lysates were then centrifuged at 14,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were removed and stored at −80 °C. 50 μg of proteins were loaded on a 10 (for p53) or 12% (for p21 and Bcl-2) polyacrylamide gel. Monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 (1:5000), monoclonal anti-p53 (1:5000), or polyclonal anti-p21 (1:500) was used as primary antibodies. After incubation with appropriate secondary antibody (1:10,000), proteins were identified using SuperSignal substrate chemiluminescence reagent.Enzyme Activities and Other AssaysCaspase 3 ActivationCells (attached and detached) were washed and collected by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) and left on ice for 30 min. Following sonication lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for caspase-3 assay in lysis buffer containing the specific substrate Ac-DEVD-AMC (12 μm) at 30 °C. Substrate cleavage was monitored fluorometrically using a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer LS-5 equipped with a chart recorder model R 100A, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 460 nm. Specific activity was demonstrated by the use of the caspase-3 inhibitor I (Ac-DEVD-CHO) that completely impedes the development of fluorescence due to the cleaved product.Cu,Zn-Superoxide Dismutase ActivityCells (attached and detached) were washed and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and sonicated. Lysates were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were used for SOD activity and protein content assay. Cu,Zn-SOD activity was measured by a polarographic method (32.Rigo A. Viglino P. Rotilio G. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with an AMEL (Milano, Italy) model 466 polarographic analyzer, in tetraborate buffer at pH 9.6. Under these conditions the activity of Mn-SOD is almost fully inhibited (33.Steinkuhler C. Sapora O. Carrı̀ M.T. Nagel W. Marcocci L. Ciriolo M.R. Weser U. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24580-24587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Data were expressed in μg/mg protein with reference to purified human Cu,Zn-SOD. For immunoblot analyses, 50 μg of proteins from supernatants were applied to each lane of a 12% polyacrylamide gel. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Cu,Zn-SOD was localized after incubation with a specific antibody as described previously (34.Rossi L. Ciriolo M.R. Marchese E. De Martino A. Giorgi M. Rotilio G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).Cytochrome c Oxidase ActivityCells (attached and detached) were washed and collected by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in PBS and sonicated. Lysates were used for cytochromec oxidase activity. The activity was measured spectrophotometrically monitoring the oxidation of cytochromec (horse heart), which had previously been reduced by treatment with excess ascorbate, followed by passage on Sephadex G-25 resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Assays were performed at 25 °C, in a medium containing 30 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 0.02 mm ferrocytochrome c at 550 nm (35.Cooperstain S.J. Lazarow A. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 189: 665-670Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activity was expressed as micromoles of cytochrome c oxidized per min−1 mg−1 protein using an extinction coefficient of 27.6 mm−1cm−1.Glutathione AssayIntracellular glutathione was assayed upon formation of S-carboxymethyl derivatives of free thiols with iodoacetic acid followed by conversion of free amino groups to 2,4-dinitrophenyl derivatives by reaction with 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as described by Reed et al.(36.Reed D.J. Babson J.R. Beatty P.W. Brodie A.E. Ellis M.W. Potter D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Cell medium was collected and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was combined with attached cells previously scraped gently from the plate. Cells were washed with PBS, resuspended, and lysed by repeated cycles of freezing and thawing under liquid nitrogen. Lysates were then utilized as described previously (37.Ciriolo M.R. Palamara A.T. Incerpi S. Lafavia E. Buè M.C. De Vito P. Garaci E. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2700-2708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).NOx AssayFormation of nitrites in the medium was quantitated by the Griess reaction, according to Schmidt (38.Schmidt H.H.H.W. Kelm M. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 491-497Google Scholar), in culture medium previously centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 10 min. A standard curve was constructed with known concentration of sodium nitrite in the same medium.Proteins were determined by the method of Lowry et al.(39.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Data PresentationAll experiments were done withn = 6; those with NONO, NOR-4, and bathocuproine were done with n = 4. Each assay was performed at least twice under identical conditions. The experiments were subjected to analysis of variance with the Genstat 5 statistic package to determine difference between controls and transfected cell lines. Data are expressed as means ± S.D., and significance was assessed by Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant.DISCUSSIONApoptosis elicited by endogenous or exogenously produced NO may play a role in brain pathological conditions, including brain ischemia and neurodegeneration (13.Leist M. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 183-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 14.Brune B. Knethen V.A. Sandau K.B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 351: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Human neuroblastoma cells in culture respond to NO challenge by alerting intrinsic machinery that ultimately leads to apoptotic cell death (51.Tamatani M. Ogawa S. Niitsu Y. Tohyama M J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1588-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 52.Uehara T. Kikuchi Y. Nomura Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). NO toxicity may be strengthened by O⨪2 via formation of peroxynitrite, and SOD that catalytically removes O⨪2 is therefore indicated as a protecting agent. In the present report, we succeeded in creating a model of neuroblastoma cells capable of surviving NO treatment by transfecting SH-SY5Y cells with Cu,Zn-SOD. However, cells transfected with a SOD mutant (G93A), as active as the wild type, were more susceptible to NO toxicity. Therefore, we suggest that O⨪2removal is not sufficient to protect from NO-mediated apoptosis and that additional properties of the G93A mutant SOD potentiate apoptogenic stimuli of NO.Our study demonstrated that apoptosis was the mode of cell death of SH-SY5Y cells upon NO insult, independently of the NO donor used. In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that GSNO can be physiologically produced in rat brain slices and that in cultured cells it is formed following treatment with commercially available NO donors (27.Inoue K. Akaike T. Miyamoto Y. Okamoto T. Sawa T. Otagiri M. Suzuki S. Yoshimura T. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27069-27075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The reaction between GSH and NO has been suggested to be catalyzed by ceruloplasmin, a multicopper oxidase, involved in iron metabolism. This protein is present in plasma as a glycoprotein and is bound to plasma membrane in astrocytes, where it functions as an important antioxidant agent (53.Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar).In our model, apoptosis was characterized by an induction of p53 protein, which is able to induce either growth arrest or apoptosis in DNA-damaged cells (17.Agarwal M.L. Taylor W.R. Chernov M.V. Chernova O.B. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). Induction of a G1 arrest is dependent upon sequence-specific DNA binding and transcriptional activation of p53 target genes such as p21, which is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases and thereby blocks cell cycle progression (42.Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). p53 increase was an early response to GSNO treatment; in fact, whereas a small percentage of WT cells entered the apoptotic pathway, they showed the same degree of p53 accumulation as the other cell lines tested. Furthermore, p53 accumulation and activation leads to p21 increase in all the three cell types; however, the cleavage product of p21 was observed only in the G93A and SH-SY5Y cells, at different extent. It has been demonstrated that p21 cleavage could be reproduced in extracts prepared from irradiated cells or by recombinant caspase 3, suggesting that a caspase-like activity is responsible for this cleavage. From these observations it was suggested that p21 may serve as a critical checkpoint regulator for both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, during the p53-mediated DNA damage response (42.Li R. Waga S. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 371: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Our data are in line with this suggestion in that the cleavage product was observed only in the cells that efficiently underwent apoptosis.Nuclear apoptosis is preceded by the disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, which in turn can facilitate the release of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c, through the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (54.Marchetti P.

Previous studies indicate that HRI contains two distinct heme-binding sites per HRI monomer. To study the role of the N terminus in the heme regulation of HRI, two N-terminally truncated mutants, Met2 and Met3 (deletion of the first 103 and 130 amino acids, respectively), were prepared. Met2 and Met3 underwent autophosphorylation and phosphorylated eIF-2α with a specific activity of approximately 50% of that of the wild type HRI. These mutants were significantly less sensitive to heme regulation bothin vivo and in vitro. In addition, the heme contents of purified Met2 and Met3 HRI were less than 5% of that of the wild type HRI. These results indicated that the N terminus was important but was not the only domain involved in the heme-binding and heme regulation of HRI. Heme binding of the individual HRI domains showed that both N terminus and kinase insertion were able to bind hemin, whereas the C terminus and the catalytic domains were not. Thus, both the N terminus and the kinase insertion, which are unique to HRI, are involved in the heme binding and the heme regulation of HRI.

The recycling of eIF-2 requires the exchange of GDP for GTP. Under physiological conditions, the affinity of eIF-2 for GDP is much higher than for GTP. This exchange reaction is catalyzed by eIF-2B, which is rate-limiting and which is present at 15–20% of the amount of eIF-2 in reticulocytes. The phosphorylation of eIF-2α by HRI renders eIF-2B nonfunctional, resulting in the shut off of protein synthesis (reviewed in Ref. 3.Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Translation in Eukaryotes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 193-229Google Scholar). HRI belongs to the family of the eIF-2α kinases, which also includes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (4.Hovanessian J.

Activation of PKR by dsRNA is achieved by its autophosphorylation (21.Taylor D.R. Lee S.B. Romano P.R. Marshak D.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Esteban M. Mathews M.B. Mol. Cell.

Furthermore, mutation of Thr-446 and Thr-451 in the PKR activation loop to Ala impaired the kinase activity of this protein (22.Romano P.R. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Zhang X. Wang Q. Taylor D.R. Zhang F.

The exact mechanism of activation of PKR is not known, but it may be brought about by dimerization or conformational changes (2.Clemens, M. J. (1996) in Translational Control(Hershey, J. W.

Biol. 1998; 18: 7009-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have shown recently that the hydrophobic residues present in the N-terminal domain of PKR are required for dimerization and protein-protein interaction between PKR monomers. The GCN2 protein contains a domain in the C terminus that is closely related in sequence to histidyl-tRNA synthase. This domain is essential for the activation of the protein kinase domain when uncharged tRNA accumulates due to amino acid starvation (14.Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 30.Hinnebusch, A. G. (1996) in Translational Control(Hershey, J. W. B., Mathews, M.

The C terminus of GCN2 expressed inEscherichia coli has been shown to bind yeast tRNA (31.Wek S.A. Zhu S. Wek R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4497-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of dimerization in the activation and catalytic function of GCN2 has been demonstrated (30.Hinnebusch, A. G. (1996) in Translational Control(Hershey, J. W. B., Mathews, M.

HRI has been expressed in insect Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. This recombinant HRI is an active autokinase and eIF-2α kinase and is regulated by heme. HRI expressed in insect cells can inhibit the protein synthesis in Sf9 cells (34.Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Baculovirus-expressed wild type (Wt) HRI and the inactive K199R mutant, in which the conserved Lys-199 in the catalytic domain II is changed to Arg, have been purified to homogeneity. Purified HRI is a homodimer and a hemoprotein with two distinct heme-binding sites. Binding of heme to the first site is stable, whereas binding to the second site is dynamic and is responsible for the rapid regulation of HRI by heme (35.Chefalo P.J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Oh J. Chen J.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism of the regulation of HRI by heme, we have localized the heme-binding domains of HRI in this study. We found that N-terminal deletion mutants, Met2 and Met3 HRI, were active kinases. Met2 and Met3 HRI were less heme-responsive and had very low heme contents as compared with Wt HRI. Furthermore, both the N terminus and KI domains expressed in E. coli were able to bind heme, whereas the kinase catalytic domains and the C terminus were not. These results show that the N terminus and the KI region of HRI are involved in the heme binding and heme regulation of HRI. The Wt HRI was previously cloned in the TMV-SP64 plasmid in which a unique NcoI site at the first ATG of HRI cDNA was engineered (13.Chen J.-J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7729-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Similarly, aNcoI site was engineered in Met2 and Met3 HRI constructs at the initiation codon. The introduction of the NcoI site resulted in the change of the second amino acid from Arg to Gly for Met3 construct, whereas no change was made in Met2 construct. The Met2 and Met3 HRI were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis and recombinant polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique (36.Vallette F. Mege E. Keiss A. Adesnik M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested with NcoI and KpnI and subcloned to TMV-HRI plasmid. The plasmid containing the Met2 or Met3 HRI was digested with BglII and EcoRI and ligated into the polylinker region of the pV1392 baculovirus recombination vector. The recombinant HRI baculovirus were generated as described previously (34.Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Chefalo P.J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Oh J. Chen J.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The postribosomal supernatants was subjected to 50% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pellet was dissolved in a low salt buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol and was dialyzed against 2 liters of this buffer overnight (13.Chen J.-J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I. Pal J.K. Brodsky M. London I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7729-7733Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Wt and mutant HRI proteins were purified by immunoaffinity column chromatography, which was prepared by using anti-HRI monoclonal antibody mABF as described previously (35.Chefalo P.J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Oh J. Chen J.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The antigenic determinants of m ABF is localized in the KI region; 2P. J. Chefalo and J.-J. Chen, unpublished observations. therefore, the Wt and the N-terminally truncated mutants would purify similarly. The autokinase and eIF-2α kinase activities of Wt, Met2 and Met3 HRI were determined by protein kinase assays as described previously (37.Chen J.-J. Yang J.M. Petryshyn R. Kosower N. London I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9559-9564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HRI proteins were incubated with various concentrations of hemin (0–5 μm) at 30 °C for 5 min. Protein kinase assays were initiated by the addition of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), 50 μm ATP, and 100 ng of eIF-2, and the reactions were proceeded for 5 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-sample buffer containing 1.25% β-mercaptoethanol. The phosphorylated polypeptides were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250. The extents of eIF-2α phosphorylation were visualized by autoradiography and quantitated by scintillation counting of the gel slices corresponding to eIF-2α. Protein kinase assays of the S10 crude extract of each HRI protein in the absence of purified eIF-2 was also performed and was used for background subtraction. Western blot analysis of HRI and various domains was performed, using anti-HRI mABF monoclonal antibody (38.Pal J.K. Chen J.-J. London I.M. Biochem. 1991; 30: 2555-2562Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) or anti-His6 monoclonal antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (39.Yang J.M. London I.M. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20519-20524Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wt and Met2 HRI were synthesized in TNT rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) at 30 °C for 15 min followed by 4 min pulse of [35S]Met. The extents of transformation of HRI were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE of the 35S-labeled HRI bound to Ni-NTA resins. The transformation of 35S-labeled HRI at different concentrations of hemin in RRL was carried out for 1 h as described previously (40.Uma S. Hartson S.D. Chen J.-J. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11648-11656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Wt and mutant HRI were expressed in Sf9 cells supplemented with 5 μm hemin for 48 h and were immunoaffinity purified as described above. The UV and visible spectra of heme-enriched Wt and mutant HRI were performed using a Hewlett-Packard spectrometer as described previously (35.Chefalo P.J. Rafie-Kolpin M. Oh J. Chen J.-J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 820-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The low salt buffer described above was used as the blank. The UV and visible difference spectra of purified domains of HRI were determined similarly using a Shimidzu 1601 BioSpec. However, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 2 mm DTT and hemin was used as the blank. The first 154 amino acids (aa) of HRI were subcloned into the modified pET28a vector, which contained a His6 tag and TEV protease cleavage site, by blunt end ligation into NdeI/EcoRI site. The first kinase lobe (aa 144–231), the kinase insertion region (aa 219–420), the mouse kinase insertion region (aa 241–406), the second kinase lobe (aa 421–540), and the C terminus (aa 541–626) were prepared by PCR. For subcloning into the pET28a vector, anNdeI site and an EcoRI site were engineered at the 5′ and 3′ ends of each PCR fragment, respectively. Bacterial cells (BL21 strain) containing the first kinase lobe and second kinase lobe plasmids were induced at A 0.6 with 100 μmisopropylthiogalactoside at 25 °C overnight. For the N terminus, cells were grown and induced at 37 °C for 3 h at A0.6. The rabbit KI (aa 219–420) and C terminus were induced with isopropylthiogalactoside at A 0.8 and 0.95, respectively, and cells were grown at 37 °C for 3 h. The mouse KI (aa 241–406) was induced at A 0.5 with 100 μmisopropylthiogalactoside at 25 °C for 6 h. Bacterial cells were lysed according to the Qiagen manual in a buffer containing 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole and sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to the sonicated cell extracts to a final concentration of 1%. Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 15 min. The 10,000 × g supernatants were loaded on Ni-NTA agarose column. The column was washed with 50 mmNaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm followed by a 60 mm imidazole wash for kinase I and kinase II. For the N terminus, rabbit KI, mouse KI, and C terminus, a 60 mm imidazole wash was employed. Proteins were then eluted in the elution buffer containing 50 mmNaPO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 250 mmimidazole. The imidazole was removed by dialysis against 2 liters of PBS with 2 mm DTT overnight. Purified proteins were concentrated by Slide-A-lyzer dialysis and concentration solution (Pierce) and then stored at −80 °C prior to spectral analysis. The concentration of each domain was determined by the absorbance at 280 nm. To remove the His tag from each domain expressed as His tag fusion protein, 20 μg of each fusion protein were incubated with 10 units of recombinant tobacco etching virus (rTEV) protease in the presence of rTEV buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) and 1 mm DTT at 30° for up to 3 h. The efficiency of His tag cleavage was analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE of aliquots of the expressed proteins before and after rTEV protease treatment. The cleaved His tag was removed by dialysis against 2 liters of PBS with 2 mm DTT overnight. To determine the role of the N terminus in the heme regulation of HRI, two N-terminal deletion mutants were prepared by site directed mutagenesis and recombinant PCR as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These two mutants are schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. Met2 HRI began at the second methionine, and the first 103 amino acids were deleted. Met3 HRI began at the third methionine, and the first 130 amino acids were deleted. Wild type and mutant HRI were expressed in Sf9 cells using the baculovirus expression system. The expressions of the Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI proteins were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-HRI monoclonal antibody (Fig.2 A). Wt HRI migrated at about 90 kDa in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). As expected, Met2 and Met3 HRI were smaller than the Wt HRI and migrated at about 67 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2and 3). The levels of expression of Met2 and Met3 HRI were comparable to that of the Wt HRI (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Western blot analysis and protein kinase activities of Wt , Met2, and Met3 HRI.

Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI expressed in Sf9 cells were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The autokinase and eIF-2α kinase activities of these mutants in Sf9 cell extracts and in purified proteins were examined. Both Met2 and Met3 HRI were active eIF-2α kinases and autokinases (Fig. 2,B and D). The autophosphorylations of Wt, Met2 and Met3 HRI were more evident when larger amounts of HRI proteins were used (Fig. 2 D). To determine the specific activities of these mutants for eIF-2α, the protein kinase assays were done quantitatively by using limiting amounts of Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI. Thus, the autophosphorylation was not as obvious in these experiments (Fig. 2 B). Under these conditions, the rate of eIF-2α phosphorylation was linear for the first 10 min, as shown in Fig.2 C, and is also linear with the amount of HRI used (data not shown). The specific activities of Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI, were determined from Fig. 2 B to be 5.64, 3.49, and 2.72 pmol of eIF-2α phosphorylated per ng of HRI per 5 min at 30 °C, respectively. We have consistently observed that the specific activities of Met2 and Met3 HRI were about 50% of that of the Wt HRI. These results suggest that the N-terminal 103 amino acids may be important for achieving the high specific eIF-2α kinase activity but may not be essential for kinase activity of HRI. To determine the role of the N terminus in the heme regulation of HRI, the inhibitions of eIF-2α kinase activities of the Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI by heme were compared. Incubation of HRI proteins in S10 extracts with hemin (0–5 μm) reduced the eIF-2α kinase activities of the Wt, Met2, and Met3 HRI. However, the eIF-2α kinase activity of Wt HRI was always more sensitive to inhibition by heme than that of Met2 or Met3 HRI (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the extent of the inhibition of Met2 and Met3 HRI by heme was less than that of Wt HRI at all hemin concentrations tested. Previously, it was shown that baculovirus expressed HRI could act as an inhibitor of protein synthesis and shut off its own synthesis. The addition of hemin to culture medium has been shown to increase the expression of Wt HRI, presumably by inhibiting its activity in insect cells and thus allowing a higher level of HRI protein expression (34.Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25788-25794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the increase in the expression level of Wt or mutant HRI in response to exogenous heme was used as a criterion for the heme responsiveness of HRI in vivo. In the presence of 5 μm hemin, the expression level of Wt HRI increased to 3 times the control value. In contrast, no significant increase in the expression level of Met2 or Met3 HRI was observed when heme was added to the culture media (Table I). These results indicated that Met2 and Met3 HRI were less heme-responsive than the Wt HRI in vivo. It is to be noted that the Sf9 cells are very sensitive to hemin and that hemin concentrations higher than 5 μm result in cell death (34.Chefalo P.J. Yang J.M. Ramaiah K.V.A. Gehrke L. Chen J.-J. J.

Therefore, it is not possible to examine hemin response at concentrations greater than 5 μm in Sf9 cells.Table IEffect of hemin on the expression levels of Wt and mutant HRI in Sf9 cellsHRIExpression level (mg/109 cells)0 μm hemin5 μm heminRatioWt0.782.302.97Met20.500.511.03Met30.780.931.19Sf9 cells (4 × 106) were infected with recombinant baculovireus containing Wt, Met2, or Met3 HRI for 48 h in the absence or presence of 5 μm hemin as described previously (34.Chefalo P.J.

Using synchronized pulse-chase translations, we have shown previously that newly synthesized HRI can be transformed into a stable and an active heme-regulated eIF-2α kinase by autophosphorylation in RRL (40.Uma S.

The transformed HRI exhibits a slower electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE. This transformation of HRI is inhibited by heme and can be used as another criterion for heme regulation of this protein under erythroid environment. As shown in Fig.4, [35S]Met2 HRI, like35S-labeled Wt HRI, underwent transformation with the characteristic mobility shift on SDS-PAGE when incubated in heme-deficient RRL. The transformation of Met2 HRI was inhibited by hemin as was that of Wt HRI. However, the extent of Met2 HRI transformation at 2.5 μm hemin was greater than that of the Wt HRI"
https://openalex.org/W2044389552,"Protein kinase CK2 is a tetrameric enzyme composed of two catalytic (α and/or α′) subunits and two regulatory (β) subunits. Because CK2β is synthesized in excess of CK2α, we hypothesized that formation of CK2β homodimers precedes the incorporation of the catalytic subunits of CK2 into complexes. To test this hypothesis, we cotransfected cells with two epitope-tagged variants of CK2β. The results of these cotransfection studies demonstrate that interactions between two CK2β subunits take place in the absence of CK2α. Together with results from previous biosynthetic labeling studies, these results suggest that formation of CK2β homodimers occurs before incorporation of catalytic subunits of CK2 into CK2 complexes. We also cotransfected Cos-7 cells with a deletion fragment of CK2β (i.e. Myc-β1–166) together with full-length hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CK2β and/or CK2α′. Although complexes between Myc-β1–166 and HA-β were readily detected, we obtained no evidence of direct interactions between Myc-β1–166 and HA-CK2α′. These results suggest that residues within the N-terminal 166 amino acids of CK2β are sufficient for interactions between CK2β subunits, whereas the C-terminal domain of CK2β is required for complex formation with the catalytic subunits of CK2.

The enzyme is ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotic organisms and is essential for viability (5.Chen Wu J.L. Padmanabha R. Glover C.V. Mol. Cell.

There have been a number of reports that CK2 is overexpressed in tumors or in leukemic cells (8.Yenice S. Davis A.T. Goueli S.A. Akdas A. Limas C. Ahmed K. Prostate. 1994; 24: 11-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9.Stalter G. Siemer S. Becht E. Ziegler M. Remberger K. Issinger O.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In these transgenic mice, CK2 exhibited cooperation with c-Myc or with Tal-1 in transformation (12.Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 13.Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5160-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results suggest that CK2 is a regulatory component of the protein kinase networks that regulate the growth and division of cells. There is a significant body of evidence demonstrating that CK2 phosphorylates and regulates the activity of numerous proteins involved in the control of various aspects of cellular function (1.Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2.Issinger O.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3.Litchfield D.W.

However, the regulation of CK2 in intact cells remains an area of considerable controversy (14.Litchfield D.W. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. Cell. Mol. Biol. Res. 1994; 40: 373-381PubMed Google Scholar). In general, there is a consensus that the majority of CK2 in cells exists as a tetrameric complex composed of two catalytic (designated α and/or α′) and two noncatalytic β subunits (1.Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1054: 267-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 2.Issinger O.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 59: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 3.Litchfield D.W.

The catalytic subunits contain all of the conserved consensus motifs for members of the protein kinase family. By comparison, in mammals, the β subunit of CK2 does not share extensive homology with any known proteins. It is noteworthy that CK2β exhibits remarkable conservation between species. In fact, the deduced amino acid sequences of human and chicken CK2β are identical. The deduced sequences ofXenopus CK2β and zebrafish CK2β differ from those of human and chicken CK2β by only one and two amino acids, respectively (4.Allende J.E. Allende C.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). This high level of evolutionary conservation suggests that CK2β has important cellular functions. By itself, CK2β has no known catalytic activity, but it appears to regulate the activity of CK2α in a number of ways. In particular, CK2β stabilizes CK2α and modulates the ability of CK2α to interact with and phosphorylate substrate proteins (15.Marin O. Meggio F. Sarno S. Pinna L.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7192-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 16.Meggio F. Boldyreff B. Marin O. Pinna L.A. Issinger O.G. Eur. J.

Furthermore, CK2β appears to mediate the activating effects of compounds such as polyamines that may have a role in regulating CK2 in cells (19.Leroy D. Heriche J.K. Filhol O. Chambaz E.M. Cochet C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20820-20827Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 20.Shore L.J. Soler A.P. Gilmour S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12536-12543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overall, these results suggest that CK2β is a critical mediator of the cellular functions of CK2. To fully define the cellular functions of CK2 and to understand its regulation, a thorough understanding of the functions of each of its subunits is critical. In recent studies using the yeast two-hybrid system, we and others demonstrated that CK2β has the ability to interact with CK2α or with CK2β, whereas CK2α is only able to interact with CK2β (21.Gietz R.D. Graham K.C. Litchfield D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13017-13021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22.Boldyreff B. Mietens U. Issinger O.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 23.Kusk M. Bendixen C. Duno M. Westergaard O. Thomsen B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggested that interactions between two β subunits are responsible for bringing two α:β dimers into active tetrameric complexes. However, because yeast contain endogenous CK2, it was not possible to exclude the possibility that indirect interactions between two CK2β subunits were being mediated by endogenous CK2α. From biosynthetic labeling studies, we had also demonstrated that CK2β is synthesized in excess of CK2α (24.Luscher B. Litchfield D.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 521-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that newly synthesized CK2α is rapidly incorporated into complexes with CK2β, whereas newly synthesized CK2β associates more slowly into complexes with CK2α. Consequently, we hypothesized that formation of complexes between CK2β subunits precedes the incorporation of catalytic subunits into tetrameric complexes. In the present study, we provide evidence from transfection studies using two epitope-tagged versions of CK2β (i.e. CK2β with an N-terminal HA epitope designated HA-CK2β and CK2β with an N-terminal Myc epitope designated Myc-CK2β) to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, toward the objective of controlling the activity of CK2 within cells by controlling its ability to form tetrameric complexes, we have also examined the ability of individual domains of CK2β to interact with full-length CK2α and/or CK2β in cells. In this regard, we have demonstrated that an N-terminal fragment of CK2β encoding residues 1–166 retains the ability to interact with CK2β in cells but fails to directly form stable complexes with CK2α′. These results indicate that residues required for stable interactions between two CK2β subunits in cells are localized within the N-terminal 166 residues of CK2β. By comparison, stable interactions between CK2β and the catalytic subunits of CK2 require additional residues. Importantly, our results suggest that deletion mutants of CK2β such as CK2β1–166 offer new strategies for controlling the functions of CK2 in cells by altering the subunit composition of CK2 in cells in a manner that prevents formation of intact tetrameric CK2 complexes. Antipeptide antibodies directed against CK2α (anti-CK2α376–391), against CK2α′ (anti-CK2α′333–350), and against CK2β (anti-CK2β198–215) have been described previously (25.Litchfield D.W. Lozeman F.J.

Biotinylated rat monoclonal anti-HA antibodies (clone 3F10) were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-biotin antibodies were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. The hybridoma producing 9E10 monoclonal antibodies directed against the Myc epitope (28.Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsey G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were used to produce ascites fluid in mice, and antibodies were partially purified from ascites fluid by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Full-length HA-CK2α′ and Myc-CK2β, containing N-terminal HA or Myc epitope tags, respectively, were expressed using pRc/CMV as described previously (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Full-length CK2β containing an N-terminal HA tag was constructed using a strategy similar to that used for construction of HA-CK2α′. Briefly, aNotI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the coding region of the CK2β cDNA using the polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: sense (ATA AGA ATG CGG CCG CAG CAG CTC AGA GGA G) and antisense (CTT GGG GCA GTA GAG CTT). The amplified sequence was subcloned into the TA vector (Invitrogen) and verified by sequencing (29.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52668) Google Scholar). Myc epitope-tagged CK2β 1–166 was amplified from full-length Myc-tagged CK2β in plasmid pZW12 using the sense primer (CTG GCG GCC GCT CTA GAA CTA G) and the antisense primer (GGG GCC CCT ACA TGT GAG GGA AAC CAG) to introduce a stop codon followed by an ApaI site. The construct was verified by sequencing and cloned into pRc/CMV as a NotI/ApaI fragment. The vector pRc/CMV is suitable for transfection of mammalian cells using the CMV promoter to direct protein expression. Cos-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Intergen) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were transfected using the calcium-phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell.

Cells were washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline 12–16 h after addition of the calcium phosphate precipitate and were harvested 24–48 h after removal of the precipitate. For biosynthetic labeling, transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and were then incubated in prewarmed methionine and cysteine-free medium (ICN) for 10 min. Cells were then radiolabeled by the addition of35S-EasyTAGTM (NEN Life Science Products) protein labeling mix (0.25 mCi/10-cm dish) where indicated. For immunoprecipitation of expressed proteins, cells were lysed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40) for immune complex kinase assays or with L buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholic acid) for analysis of co-immunoprecipitating proteins (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For cell extraction, lysis buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitors (1% aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Monoclonal antibodies (12CA5 or 9E10) were covalently attached to protein A-Sepharose as described (30.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 526-527Google Scholar) and incubated with lysates for 1 h with rocking on ice. For peptide competition experiments, 20 μg of the appropriate antigenic peptide was added for each μl of antibody. The Sepharose beads were then washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and then three times with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). After resuspending the washed immune complexes in kinase buffer, CK2 activity was measured using the synthetic peptide RRRDDDSDDD as a CK2 substrate (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions contained 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 200–500 cpm/pmol) and synthetic peptide (0.1 mm). Reactions were initiated by the addition of immune complex and were terminated after 20 min at 30 °C by spotting an aliquot of the reaction mix on phosphocellulose paper (P81, Whatman) as described (35.Litchfield D.W. Arendt A. Lozeman F.J. Krebs E.G. Hargrave P.A. Palczewski K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 261: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Immune complexes that were prepared using L buffer for the analysis of co-immunoprecipitating proteins were washed three times with L buffer, and bound proteins were then solubilized with Laemmli sample buffer. Briefly, transfected and nontransfected Cos-7 cells were lysed in low salt lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40) and sonicated twice for 10 s on ice, and cell debris was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at 55,000 rpm. Cell lysate (200 μl) was separated using a Superose 12 column on an fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA, anti-Myc, anti-α, and anti-β antibodies. SDS-PAGE (31.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar) and immunoblotting (32.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For immunoblots, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and immune complexes were detected using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for detection by enhanced chemiluminescence using Supersignal (Pierce) as substrate or with secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase for color development with bromochloroindoyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium as substrates. Protein determinations were performed according to the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard (33.Bradford M.M. Anal.

Biochem. 1999; 191: 21-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it had been demonstrated that the regulatory subunit of CK2 (i.e. CK2β) interacts with CK2α and with CK2β. To determine whether complexes between two CK2β subunits form within cells prior to the formation of complexes with CK2α, we prepared constructs encoding two different epitope-tagged constructs of CK2β, HA-CK2β, and Myc-CK2β (Fig.1 A). As demonstrated in Fig.1, HA-CK2β can be specifically immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 antibodies (B and C, lane 1) or with anti-CK2β198–215 antibodies (B andC, lane 3). Similarly, Myc-CK2β is immunoprecipitated using 9E10 monoclonal antibodies (B andD, lane 5) and with anti-CK2β198–215 (B and D,lane 6). Importantly, the 12CA5 antibodies do not react with Myc-CK2β (B and C, lane 4) and the 9E10 antibodies do not react with HA-CK2β (B andD, lane 2). Endogenous CK2β is also evident in anti-CK2β immunoprecipitates (B, lanes 3 and6) and in the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate (B,lane 5). The presence of endogenous CK2β in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates is indicative of endogenous CK2β in complexes containing Myc-CK2β. The high levels of Myc-β and HA-β synthesis that is observed relative to endogenous CK2β during this 20-min biosynthetic labeling period likely results from the use of the strong CMV promoter to drive the expression of the transfected proteins. To verify that HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β are functional with respect to their capacity to interact with CK2α, we demonstrated that either HA-CK2β (Fig. 2 B) or Myc-CK2β (Fig. 2 C) can be detected in specific anti-CK2α379–391 immunoprecipitates. Moreover, we also demonstrated that the HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β signals are specific to complexes containing endogenous CK2α by performing immunoprecipitations in the presence of antigenic α376–391 peptide (Fig. 2, A–C). As previously noted (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the HA-CK2β or Myc-CK2β bands of different electrophoretic mobility most likely reflect different phosphorylated forms of the proteins. Based on this assumption, it appears that a significant proportion of HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β are phosphorylated in these complexes that are isolated by immunoprecipitation with anti-CK2α antibodies. The observation that kinase activity toward a CK2-specific synthetic peptide substrate is detected in the appropriate anti-HA (Fig. 2 D) or anti-Myc (Fig. 2 E) immunoprecipitates is also indicative of complex formation between the transfected proteins and endogenous catalytic subunits of CK2. We do not have a precise explanation for the significant differences observed for the kinase activities of anti-HA (Fig. 2 D) or the anti-Myc (Fig. 2 E) immunoprecipitates. However, the differences may in part reflect differences in immunoprecipitation efficiency or perhaps conformational differences between the two antibodies. Having verified functional expression of HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β and specificity of isolation and detection, we subsequently cotransfected the two constructs into cells (Fig. 3). We were primarily interested in determining whether the two versions of CK2β are capable of interacting with each other in cells in the absence of CK2α. Consequently, two preliminary rounds of immunoprecipitations were carried out using a mixture of anti-CK2α and anti-CK2α′ antibodies to deplete extracts of tetrameric CK2 complexes. These depleted extracts were subsequently immunoprecipitated with either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibodies (Fig. 3). Immunoprecipitations were also performed with the mixture of anti-CK2α and anti-CK2α′ to verify that extracts had indeed been depleted of tetrameric complexes and with anti-CK2β antibodies to verify that the tagged proteins do indeed encode CK2β (data not shown). Examination of Fig. 3 clearly demonstrates that HA-CK2β can be detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3 A) andvice versa (Fig. 3 B). Again, bands of different electrophoretic mobility most likely reflect differences in phosphorylation state as previously noted (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is notable that, unlike Fig. 2 where a significant proportion of the HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β exhibits retarded electrophoretic mobility characteristic of phosphorylation, the majority of the HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β observed in Fig. 3 appears to be unphosphorylated. Small amounts of phosphorylated CK2β, most evident for HA-β, could reflect the isolation of small quantities of tetrameric CK2 that was not removed during the two rounds of immunodepletion with anti-CK2α and anti-CK2α′ antibodies. The amount of Myc-CK2β that is found in anti-HA immunoprecipitates and vice versa is much greater than the amount of Myc-CK2β or HA-CK2β that is detected in anti-CK2α/CK2α′ immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Collectively, these data suggest that the complexes between Myc-CK2β and HA-CK2β have formed in the absence of a catalytic CK2 subunit. In a previous study (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we had demonstrated that HA-CK2α′ and Myc-CK2β form complexes that can be isolated by co-immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore, those results indicated that Myc-CK2β is readily autophosphorylated upon formation of complexes with HA-CK2α′, whereas in the absence of complex formation, Myc-CK2β remained unphosphorylated (18.Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, to demonstrate that complexes between HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β are capable of forming tetrameric CK2 complexes containing catalytic subunits, we next performed transfections of HA-CK2β and Myc-CK2β in the presence or absence of HA-CK2α′ (Fig. 4). Myc-CK2β was isolated by immunoprecipitation with 9E10 antibodies, and immunoprecipitates were examined by immunoblots using 12CA5 antibodies (Fig. 4) to detect the presence of co-precipitating HA-CK2α′ or HA-CK2β. As expected, either HA-CK2α′ (Fig. 4,lane 1) or HA-CK2β (Fig. 4, lane 2) can be isolated in complexes with Myc-CK2β. Furthermore, both HA-CK2β and HA-CK2α′ are detected in anti-Myc immunoprecipitates when cells are cotransfected with plasmids encoding Myc-CK2β together with HA-CK2α′ and HA-CK2β (Fig. 4, lane 3). Importantly, when isolated in the latter complexes, HA-CK2β exhibits a profile similar to that observed in Fig. 2 B and appears to be phosphorylated. Because autophosphorylation is an intramolecular process, this result indicates that HA-CK2β is part of a complex that contains HA-CK2α′, which provides kinase activity, and with Myc-CK2β, which provides the Myc epitope that is used for isolation of the complex. By comparison, in complexes lacking HA-CK2α′ (Fig. 4,lane 2), HA-CK2β does not appear to be phosphorylated. In cells that were transfected solely with plasmid encoding Myc-CK2β (Fig. 4, lane 4), neither HA-CK2α′ nor HA-CK2β are detected. An identical blot probed with anti-Myc confirmed the presence of Myc-CK2β in all lanes (data not shown). Overall, these observations provide further support that the epitope-tagged CK2 subunits are competent for the formation of intact CK2 complexes. Results from a number of laboratories including our own have led to the elucidation of functional domains of CK2β (15.Marin O. Meggio F. Sarno S. Pinna L.A.

These results were obtained primarily by in vitro reconstitution of bacterially expressed proteins or through analyses using the yeast two-hybrid system. Overall, these result suggest that CK2β forms stable interactions with CK2α through residues within its C-terminal domain and that CK2β interacts with another CK2β subunit through residues with its N-terminal domain. However, there are discrepancies regarding the precise domain(s) of CK2β that are responsible for stable interactions with another CK2β. From the studies of Kusk et al. (23.Kusk M. Bendixen C. Duno M. Westergaard O. Thomsen B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 253: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the region of CK2β that was required for homodimerization was mapped to residues 1–145 of CK2β, whereas the data of Boldyreff et al. (22.Boldyreff B. Mietens U. Issinger O.G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 153-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggested that residues 155–165 were required for homodimerization of CK2β. Our own studies with the yeast two-hybrid system were inconclusive (39.Litchfield D.W. Slominski E. Lewenza S. Narvey M. Bosc D.G. Gietz R.D. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To extend the results of our own studies, we were interested in further examining the interaction domains of CK2β in intact mammalian cells. Importantly, we sought to examine these interactions using deletion products with small Myc epitope tags instead of the relatively large fusions that are used in the two-hybrid system.

Most H. pylori strains express the type II carbohydrates, Lewis X and Y, whereas a small population express the type I carbohydrates, Lewis A and B. The expression of Lewis A and Lewis X, as in the case ofH. pylori strain UA948, requires the addition of fucose in α1,4 and α1,3 linkages to type I or type II carbohydrate backbones, respectively. This work describes the cloning and characterization of a single H. pylori fucosyltransferase (FucT) enzyme, which has the ability to transfer fucose to both of the aforementioned linkages in a manner similar to the human fucosyltransferase V (Fuc-TV). Two homologous copies of the fucT gene have been identified in each of the genomes sequenced. The characteristic adenosine and cytosine tracts in the amino terminus and repeated regions in the carboxyl terminus are present in the DNA encoding the two UA948fucT genes, but these genes also contain differences when compared with previously identified H. pylori fucTs. The UA948fucTa gene encodes an approximately 52-kDa protein containing 475 amino acids, whereas UA948fucTb does not encode a full-length FucT protein.In vitro, UA948FucTa appears to add fucose with a greater than 5-fold preference for type II chains but still retains significant activity using type I acceptors. The addition of the fucose to the type II carbohydrate acceptors, by UA948FucTa, does not appear to be affected by fucosylation at other sites on the carbohydrate acceptor, but the rate of fucose transfer is affected by terminal fucosylation of type I acceptors.

In the human body the expression and distribution of Lewis antigens is tightly regulated by a series of glycosyltransferases that add monosaccharides to precursor structures (8.Costache M.

Vox Sang. 1995; 69: 166-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The synthesis of Lewis antigens that contain two fucose moieties can occur in two ways, a terminal fucosylation, by an α1,2 fucosyltransferase (FucT), followed by subterminal fucosylation, by an α1,3/4 FucT, or subterminal fucosylation followed by terminal fucosylation (see Fig. 1). Inactivation or lack of expression of one of these FucTs leads to the expression of monofucosylated Lewis antigens. The Leastructure is synthesized by addition of fucose by an α(1,3/4) FucT encoded by the FUT-3 gene to a Type I acceptor (lacto-N-biose (Galβ1–3GlcNAc; see Fig. 1A) (10.Kukowska-Latallo J.

Six separate human FucT enzymes have been identified that have the capacity to catalyze the transfer of fucose to the Type II precursor, LacNAc, to produce Lex: Fuc-TIII, Fuc-IV, Fuc-V, Fuc-VI, Fuc-VII, and Fuc-TIX (11.Oriol R.

In previous studies afucT gene from NCTC11637 and a fucT gene from NCTC11639 have been cloned, and in vitro characterization of the FucT enzymes did not demonstrate α(1,4) FucT activity (28.Ge Z.

This is consistent with the observation that the lipopolysaccharide of these strains does not contain any type I Lewis antigens (30.Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Pang H. Walsh E.J. Moran A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2489-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). 4D. A. Rasko, unpublished data. We have previously identified an H. pylori strain, UA948 that expresses both type I (Lea) and type II (Lex) carbohydrate structures simultaneously (1.Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H.N. Rasko D.A. Taylor D.E. Zheng P.Y. Appelmelk B.J. Wirth H.-P. Yang M. Blaser M.J. Hynes S.O. Moran A.P. Perry M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11533-11543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). For H. pylori to produce the Lewis structures (Lea and Lex) in the LPS O-chain, as for the production of Lewis antigens by human cells, there is a requirement for the addition of fucose to both α(1,3) and α(1,4) linkages. Thus it is expected that UA948 contains both α(1,3) and α(1,4) FucT activities (Fig.1). We have examined the FucTs from the H. pylori strain UA948 in an attempt to isolate the α(1,4) FucT activity. In this study we demonstrate that a single H. pylori FucT enzyme from UA948 contains both α(1,3) and α(1,4) FucT activity responsible for the production of both Lea and Lex in the LPS O-side chain, while the other copy of the fucT gene does not encode a functional FucT enzyme. Comparisons of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the newly identified H. pyloriα(1,3/4) FucT with the previously identified H. pyloriα(1,3) FucTs allowed us to predict some of the domains of the enzyme that are potentially responsible for broadening the range of acceptors used by this enzyme. H. pyloristrains were cultured by standard methods described by Taylor et al. (31.Taylor D.E. Hargreaves J.A. Ng L.K. Sherbaniuk R.W. Jewell L.D. Am. J. Clin.

Isolates from a frozen stock were thawed and plated out on BHI-YE agar plates (3.7% brain heart infusion, 0.5% yeast extract, 15 μg/ml of both vancomycin and amphoterocin B, 5% of fetal bovine serum, 1.2% agar). These plates were incubated at 37 °C under microaerobic conditions for 2–4 days. Positive H. pyloricultures were confirmed by urease test and microscopy.

Escherichia coliDH10β were grown on Lauria broth agar plates containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and/or 50 μg/ml chloramphenicol or 50 μg/ml kanamycin depending on the resistance markers present on the plasmids within the cells. Standard DNA manipulation techniques including the isolation, transformation, and restriction enzyme digestion analysis of plasmid DNA were detailed by Sambrooket al. (33.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Both strands of the appropriate PCR fragments were sequenced using the Thermosequenase sequencing kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sequence analyses were performed with the BLAST program from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, MD). The Wisconsin Package (version 9.0) of the Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI) was used for the editing and alignment of sequences. The primers used for amplification and cloning of the fucTsare as follows.

Restriction with EcoRI and BamHI allowed cloning into a similarly digested pBluescript II KS+. The respective clones containing the H. pylori fucTa or fucTb were screened using the primers described above. The proposed coding region of the UA948fucTa and UA948fucTb were placed under the control of the T7 promoter. Recombinant plasmids pB948fucTa and pB948fucTb were introduced by electroporation into E. coli K38 containing the plasmid pGP1-2 (which encodes a heat-inducible T7 RNA polymerase) (34.Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2458) Google Scholar). The proteins encoded by the recombinant plasmids were expressed as follows.E. coli K38(pGP1-2) harboring the plasmids containing the recombinant UA948fucTa or UA948fucTb plasmids were grown in 20 ml of liquid LB medium with appropriate antibiotics (kanamycin and ampicillin) at 30 °C to an optical density of 0.5–0.7 at 600 nm. After collection by centrifugation, the cells were washed once in M9 medium, and resuspended in 5 ml of supplemented M9 medium and further incubated for 1 h at 30 °C. To induce the expression of the recombinant gene, the culture was shifted to 42 °C by adding 5 ml of 55 °C supplemented M9 medium and incubated for a further 15 min at 42 °C. Rifampicin was added to a final concentration of 200 μg/ml, and incubation continued for 30 min. An aliquot was removed and incubated a further 30 min with [35S]methionine (50 nCi, Mandel Scientific Company Ltd., Guelph, ON, Canada), after which the cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described previously (28.Ge Z.

Taylor D.E. Zhang Y.N. Dovichi N.J. Palcic M.M. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with some modification. Reactions were conducted at 37 °C for 20 min in a 20-μl volume containing 1.8 mm acceptor, 50 μm GDP-fucose, 60,000 dpm GDP-[3H]fucose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc., St. Louis, MO), 20 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.0), 20 mm MnCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, 35 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 9.0 μl of the enzyme preparation. Acceptors used in this study were: Type I (β Gal 1–3 β GlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3), H Type I (αFuc1–2β Gal 1–3 β GlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3), LacNAc (βGal 1–4 βGlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3), and H Type II (αFuc 1–2 β Gal 1–4 β GlcNAc-O-(CH2)8CO2CH3). These acceptors were kindly provided by Dr. O. Hindsgaul. For calculation of the specific activity of the enzyme (milli-units (which indicates the amount of enzyme/milliliter needed to convert 1 nmol of acceptor to product within the defined time period) per milligram of protein), protein concentrations of the cell extracts were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard according to the supplier's instructions. A chloramphenicol cassette inserted at a unique XmnI site in thefucT gene and the resultant construct (28.Ge Z. Chan N.W.C. Palcic M.M. Taylor D.E. J. Biol.

Natural transformation of UA948 was accomplished by the method of Ge and Taylor (36.Ge Z. Taylor D.E. Clayton C.L. Mobley H.L.T. Helicobacter pylori Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 145-152Google Scholar). Briefly, a 48-h culture from frozen stock was restreaked and grown for 5 h on a BHI-YEA plate, 5 μg of DNA containing the fucT::CAT was added to the growth. After a further incubation for 20 h at 37 °C, the culture was plated onto BHI-YEA plate containing 50 μg/ml of chloramphenicol. Cultures were grown from single colonies, and the genomic DNA was extracted according to Ge and Taylor (36.Ge Z. Taylor D.E. Clayton C.L. Mobley H.L.T. Helicobacter pylori Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1992: 145-152Google Scholar). Insertion of the CAT cassette in the fucT gene on the chromosome was confirmed by PCR with the previously described primers, which were specific to each copy of the fucT gene. PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and photographed under UV light. The conditions for the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were previously described (1.Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H.N. Rasko D.A. Taylor D.E. Zheng P.Y. Appelmelk B.J. Wirth H.-P. Yang M. Blaser M.J.

(Dedham, MA). These primary antibodies were diluted 1:100, whereas the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse IgG + IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Biocan number 115 035 068, Mississauga, ON, Canada), was diluted 1:2000. Absorbance values were recorded at 405 nm using a Titretek Multiscan MC microtitre plate reader. Absorbance values are an average of triplicate wells with blanks subtracted. Values below 0.1 absorbance units were considered negative. Whole cell extracts of the H. pyloristrains were treated with proteinase K, processed, and subjected to electrophoresis as described previously (1.Monteiro M.A. Chan K.H.N. Rasko D.A. Taylor D.E.

These gels were stained with either zinc imidazole, according to the method of Hardy et al. (38.Hardy E. Pupo E. Castellanos-Serra L. Reyes J. Fernandez-Patron C. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), or transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westboro, MA; pore size, 0.22 μm) according to the method described by Towbin et al. (39.Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44935) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes, with transferred LPS, were probed with the primary and secondary antibodies described above (anti-Lewis structure from Signet Laboratories Inc.; antibodies 1:500 dilution and goat anti-mouse conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2000, respectively). Blots were developed using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and images were visualized on BioMax BM film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY). PCR and subsequent sequence analysis of the inserts of the pB948fucTa and pB948fucTb demonstrated a significant difference in the size of the UA948fucTb gene compared with the predicted size from strain 26695. The insert in pB948fucTb contained 1774 base pairs, whereas the predicted size is 2030 base pairs. The main reason for the difference in size is the absence of a number of repeated sequences in UA948fucTb that exist in the 3′ region of 26695fucTb. On the other hand, the PCR product of UA948fucTa is 1769 base pairs long, which is similar to the predicted size of 1799 base pairs. The nucleotide sequence of UA948fucTa is 85.5% identical to the fucTa of 26695, whereas the UA948fucTb is 87.6% identical when compared with the fucTb gene in 26695.

https://openalex.org/W1981853910,"Transcription of genes encoding enzymes required for lipogenesis is induced in hepatocytes in response to elevated glucose metabolism. We have previously mapped the carbohydrate-response elements (ChoREs) of the rat liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK) and S14 genes and found them to share significant sequence similarity. However, progress in unraveling this signaling pathway has been hampered due to the difficulty in identifying the key factor(s) that bind to these ChoREs. To gain further insight into the nature of the carbohydrate-responsive transcription factor, the glucose regulatory sequences from the mouse S14 gene were examined in primary hepatocytes. Three elements were found to be essential for supporting the glucose response: a thyroid hormone-response element between −1522 and −1494, an accessory factor site between −1421 and −1392, and the ChoRE between −1450 and −1425. Of these, only the accessory factor site was conserved between the rat and mouse S14 genes. Investigation of the ChoRE sequence indicated that two half E box motifs are critical for the response to glucose. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed a complex formed between the mouse S14 ChoRE and liver nuclear proteins. This complex was also formed by ChoREs from the rat S14 and L-PK genes but not by mutants of these sites that are inactive in supporting the glucose response. These results suggest the presence of a novel transcription factor complex that mediates the glucose-regulated transcription of S14 and L-PK genes.

The first hepatic response to carbohydrate intake is the activation of key rate-limiting enyzmes that convert carbohydrate to triglycerides. In the second phase, a longer term response is generated by the induction of a variety of enzymes involved in this process. These include enzymes of glycolysis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and triglyceride synthesis and maturation. Enzyme induction results from the increased levels of the respective mRNAs, and in a number of cases, this regulation occurs at the level of transcription (for review see Refs. 1.Vaulont S. Kahn A.

Ferre P. Foufelle F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1997; 17: 325-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The effects of dietary carbohydrate in the animal can be mimicked in primary hepatocytes by increasing media glucose concentrations and consequently rates of glucose metabolism (5.Mariash C.N.

Chem. 1986; 261: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The glucose response in primary hepatocytes depends upon the presence of insulin, whose role is largely permissive through the activation of glucokinase gene expression (1.Vaulont S. Kahn A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 7.Lefrancois-Martinez A.-M. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. Vallet V. Kahn A. Antoine B.

The intracellular mediator of the carbohydrate response has not conclusively been identified, although both glucose-6-phosphate and xylulose-5-phosphate have been proposed as candidates (9.Doiron B.

Trans. 1996; 24: 372-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Other effectors that coordinately regulate most lipogenic enzyme genes include glucagon and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which repress gene expression, and thyroid hormones, which induce expression (for review see Refs. 2.Hillgartner F.B.

In several cases, thyroid hormones support the synergistic activation of lipogenic enzyme expression with carbohydrate both in whole animals and in cultured primary hepatocytes. The molecular mechanism of the functional synergism by thyroid hormones and carbohydrate is unknown but does occur at the pretranslational level (5.Mariash C.N. Kaiser F.E. Schwartz H.L. Towle H.C.

The rat S14 gene was first investigated because of its rapid response to thyroid hormones in rat liver and primary hepatocytes (14.Seelig S. Liaw C. Towle H.C. Oppenheimer J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4733-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15.Narayan P. Liaw C.W. Towle H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequent studies showed that S14 mRNA levels are controlled by stimuli that modulate fatty acid formation, including dietary carbohydrate (6.Mariash C.N. Seelig S. Schwartz H.L. Oppenheimer J.H. J.

Together with its restricted distribution in tissues active in lipogenesis, these data suggested a role for S14 in lipogenesis (17.Jump D.B. Oppenheimer J.H. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 2259-2266Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This suggestion was supported by experiments using antisense S14oligonucletides, which blocked the normal lipogenic response of hepatocytes (18.Kinlaw W.B. Church J.L. Harmon J. Mariash C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16615-16618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 19.Brown S.B. Maloney M. Kinlaw W.B. J. Biol.

The rapid induction of S14 mRNA levels by carbohydrate occurs mostly at the transcriptional level (13.Jump D.B. Bell A. Santiago V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3474-3478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection analysis in primary hepatocytes led to the identification of regulatory sequences responsible for the carbohydrate response (20.Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These sequences from −1467 to −1422 consist of two distinct sites. One site, designated the ChoRE1 or carbohydrate-response element, is found from −1448 to −1422 in the rat S14 gene and consists of two motifs related to the E box sequence CACGTG separated by 5 bp. When coupled in tandem copies, the ChoRE confers a response to glucose by itself, suggesting it is the binding site for a factor directly regulated by glucose. However, in the context of the natural promoter, an adjacent site from −1467 to −1449 is required for maximal induction. This accessory site binds an unknown hepatic transcription factor to augment the glucose response (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The ChoRE of the rat S14 gene bears striking similarity to a glucose regulatory sequence mapped in the L-PK gene, another gene regulated by carbohydrate metabolism (23.Bergot M.-O. Diaz-Guerra M.-J.M. Puzenat N. Raymondjean M. Kahn A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1871-1878Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 24.Liu Z. Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Based on the sequence of the ChoRE, it has been proposed that a member of the b/HLH/LZ transcription factor family binds to the ChoRE and activates transcription in response to glucose. The nature of the carbohydrate-responsive factor, however, is controversial. Whereas the b/HLH/LZ factor USF can bind to the ChoRE in vitro (21.Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Clearly, identification of the carbohydrate-responsive factor is critical to further studies on the mechanism governing carbohydrate regulation of lipogenic gene expression. Recently, the mouse homologue of the S14 gene was cloned (31.Grillasca J.-P. Gastaldi M. Khiri H. Dace A. Peyrol N. Reynier P. Torresani J. Planells R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 401: 38-42Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like its rat counterpart, the mouse S14 gene is regulated by dietary carbohydrate in vivo (28.Vallet V.S. Henrion A.A. Bucchini D.

In this report, we map the mouse S14 gene sequences critical for its control by carbohydrate. We demonstrate that the mouse S14 gene employs three adjacent regulatory sequences for supporting a glucose response in primary hepatocytes. One of these sequences functioned analogously with the rat S14 and L-PK ChoREs. Examination of this site in the mouse S14 gene led to the refinement of the ChoRE consensus sequence and identification of a novel liver nuclear factor that binds to the ChoRE. Primary hepatocytes were isolated from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (180–260 g) using the collagenase perfusion method as described previously (30.Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). After a 3–6-h attachment period, cells were transfected using either Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) or F1 reagent (Targeting Systems) in modified Williams' E medium with 23 mm HEPES, 0.01 μm dexamethasone, 0.1 unit/ml insulin, 1 unit/ml penicillin, 1 μg/ml streptomycin, and mm glucose for 12–14 h. Subsequently, cells were cultured in medium containing either 5.5 or 27.5 mm glucose, with or without 500 nm T3. For studies using T3, Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical Products) was added to the plates at a concentration of 0.33 mg/ml after transfection. This treatment has been shown to increase hormonal response of transfected genes (32.Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 813-816PubMed Google Scholar). After a 48-h treatment, cells were harvested for CAT assay. Results are expressed as percentage conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated forms as determined by thin layer chromatography followed by phosphor screen autoradiography (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) Mouse S14 genomic DNA was obtained from an SV129 strain mouse genomic library and was provided by Dr. C. Mariash, University of Minnesota. To prepare the mS14(−5643/+18)CAT construct, a XhoI site was first introduced at position +18 in the 5′-untranslated region of mouse S14 genomic DNA using polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis. A fragment from the unique XbaI site at −5643 to the engineered XhoI site at +18 was inserted into the pCAT(An) vector (33.Jacoby D.B. Zilz N.D. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17623-17626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′-deletion series of mouse S14CAT constructs was generated using natural restriction endonuclease sites. To prepare the mS14(−1540/−1368)(−279/+18)CAT construct, the mouse S14 sequence from −1540 to −1368 was excised from mS14(−1540/+18)CAT and inserted into the pTZ18R vector (Promega). The sequence was subsequently excised withBamHI and HindIII and inserted into mS14(−279/+18) CAT. Clustered point mutations were generated by inverse polymerase chain reaction as described previously (34.Liu H.-C. Towle H.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1021-1037PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, each oligonucleotide creating either a unique BglII site (TRE mut) orNsiI site (mut1-8) was synthesized and used to amplify the mS14(−1540/−1368)/pTZ18R plasmid. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested at the introduced restriction enzyme site, purified by gel electrophoresis, ligated, and transformed intoEscherichia coli. Mutant constructs were isolated, and mouse S14 sequences were excised with BamHI andHindIII to clone into the mS14(−279/+18) CAT construct. Oligonucleotides containing sequences of the mouse S14ChoRE (−1450/−1425), point mutants of the ChoRE (3-1 to 3-6), and the mouse S14 accessory factor site (−1421/−1392) were synthesized with additional BamHI and BglII sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. Each oligonucleotide was ligated and treated with BamHI and BglII to isolate a DNA fragment with three copies in a head-to-tail orientation. Fragments containing three copies were then inserted into the BamHI site of PK(−96)CAT construct (35.Thompson K.S. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8679-8682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs described above were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Liver nuclear extracts were prepared from male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats that had been fasted overnight and then fed a high carbohydrate diet for 16 h as described previously (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The crude liver nuclei were then fractionated by PEG (PEG8000, Hampton Research) precipitation. For the binding assays described, the PEG fraction from 0 to 6.7% was exclusively used. EMSA was performed as described previously (20.Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13222-13228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A typical reaction contained 100,000 cpm (10–30 fmol) of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide with 10–20 μg of nuclear protein. Nonspecific competitors were 0.1 μg of poly(dI·dC) and 1.9 μg of poly(dA·dT). Following incubation at room temperature for 30 min, samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4.5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and subjected to phosphorimager analysis. Antibodies to USF1 (C-20) and USF2 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and were added together to nuclear extract for 20 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of probe. The rat S14 gene sequence from −1467 to −1422 contains two sites, the accessory factor site and ChoRE, which are required to support a transcriptional response to glucose (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The mouse S14 gene sequence from −1411 to −1366 aligned to that region of the rat gene with an identity of 85%. Despite this high degree of similarity, the mouse sequence corresponding to the rat ChoRE contains a number of mismatches in the E box motifs at positions previously shown (30.Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) to be essential for the glucose response (Fig.1 A). This observation raised the question of whether the rat ChoRE is functionally conserved in the mouse gene. To investigate this question, an oligonucleotide containing the mouse sequence from −1411 to −1366 was cloned into a glucose-unresponsive PK(−96/+12)CAT reporter construct, which we have previously used as a basal promoter construct (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 30.Kaytor E.N. Shih H.-M. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7525-7531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). As shown previously (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in Fig. 1 B, a reporter construct containing the rat S14 sequence from −1467 to −1422 conferred a glucose response when transfected into primary hepatocytes. The partial stimulation observed in low glucose conditions with this construct likely reflects the fact that 5.5 mm glucose is not the basal level in terms of glucose signaling. In contrast, a reporter construct containing the mouse S14 sequence did not show any increase when compared with the basal promoter construct alone and did not respond to glucose. These data suggest that the mouse S14 sequence corresponding to the rat S14 ChoRE does not support a carbohydrate response in primary rat hepatocytes. Two possibilities may explain this observation. First, the glucose-responsive transcription factor in rat hepatocytes may not recognize the corresponding mouse ChoRE. Second, the mouse ChoRE may be located in a different position from that of the rat gene. To distinguish between these possibilities, a larger segment of the mouse S14 gene was examined for its ability to respond to glucose in rat hepatocytes. The mouse S14 genomic sequence from −5643 to +18 was cloned into a CAT reporter construct and transfected into primary rat hepatocytes. Activity of this construct was only slightly increased by either high glucose or T3 alone compared with cells maintained in low glucose without T3 (Fig.2 A). However, when transfected cells were cultured in medium containing both high glucose and T3, the mouse sequence conferred a strong induction, indicating a synergism between glucose and thyroid hormone in transactivating the gene. Thus, the mouse S14 gene is capable of being regulated by factors in the rat hepatocyte. To localize the regulatory sequences required for the effects of glucose and T3, deletions of the 5′-end of the mouse S14 genomic sequences were generated and tested in primary hepatocytes. Deletions from the 5′-end to −1540 still supported the synergistic effects of glucose and thyroid hormone, although the magnitude of the response diminished somewhat (Fig. 2 A). Further deletion to −1147 completely abolished the response. These results suggest that the sequence from −1540 to −1148 contains a regulatory element or elements that supports the synergism between glucose and thyroid hormone. Further deletion analysis within this region demonstrated that the sequence from −1540 to −1368 is required and sufficient to confer the response to glucose and T3 in primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2 B). Promoter activity directed by sequences downstream from −1368 are unaffected by these treatments. Thus, regulatory sequences in the mouse S14 gene are contained within the same DNA region as the rat gene but differ in requiring T3 for their activity. Sequence analysis revealed a putative thyroid hormone receptor binding site between −1522 to −1494 in the mouse S14 gene (see Fig. 3 A). This sequence contains two motifs related to the consensus TRE half-site (A/G)GGTCA in an inverted orientation with 7-bp spacing. Indeed, an oligonucleotide containing this sequence can bind to in vitro translated thyroid hormone receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers by EMSA. 2S.-H. Koo, and H. C. Towle, unpublished results. To verify the functional significance of this sequence, a clustered point mutation, which disrupts the TRE, was generated and tested in the context of the mS14(−1540/−1368)(−279/+18)CAT reporter construct. As expected, the construct bearing a mutation in its TRE showed a much diminished response to glucose and thyroid hormone compared with the wild type sequence (Fig. 2 B). However, a weak response to glucose is retained in the construct with the TRE mutation. These data suggest that the ligand-bound thyroid hormone receptor works as an accessory factor to augment the glucose induction of the mouse S14 gene, and an independent carbohydrate-response element is also present within this region. To identify additional regulatory sequences involved in the glucose response, further clustered point mutations were introduced into the mouse S14 gene. For this purpose, we focused on the sequence from −1469 to −1368, as this segment was capable of supporting a glucose response independent of thyroid hormone when linked to the heterologous PK(−96/+12) promoter (see Fig. 4). Eight clustered point mutants were designed spanning this segment (Fig. 3 A). Because the TRE present in −1522 to −1494 can augment the glucose-generated signal, the mutations were generated in the context of the mouse S14 gene from −1540 to −1368 and linked to the mouse S14(−279/+18) promoter. Each mutant construct was transfected into primary hepatocytes and cultured in the presence of 5.5 mm glucose or 27.5 mm glucose plus 500 nm T3 for 48 h. The ability of three of these mutant constructs (mut3, mut5, and mut6) to respond was largely or completely abolished (Fig. 3 B). All other mutant constructs displayed responses that were comparable to or, in the case of mut7, greater than the wild type construct. It is worth noting that the mut8 mutation alters sequences corresponding to the rat S14 upstream E box, further confirming that this region does not function as a ChoRE in the mouse gene. Comparable results were obtained when these mutations were tested in the context of the mS14(−1540/+18)CAT construct.2 Interestingly, the construct containing mut4, which is localized between the inactivating mut3 and mut5/6 mutations, gives a glucose response as high as the wild type. These data indicate that the glucose-responsive region of the mouse S14 gene contains two regulatory sites. Based on previous characterization of the glucose-responsive rat S14 and L-PK genes, we postulated that these two sites might function as a ChoRE and an accessory factor site (23.Bergot M.-O.

J. 1995; 308: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of the two regulatory sites predicted by mutagenesis in the mouse S14 gene, two oligonucleotides containing these sequences were generated. Each oligonucleotide was ligated in three copies in a head-to-tail orientation and linked to a CAT construct containing the PK(−96) basal promoter. These constructs were tested in primary hepatocytes at low or high glucose concentrations. The construct containing the sequence from −1421 to −1392 (corresponding to sequences mutated in mut5 and mut6) did not respond to glucose but showed higher basal activity in low glucose, suggesting that a regulatory sequence for an accessory factor is present in this region (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the corresponding region of the rat S14 gene also contains an accessory factor site. The construct containing the sequence from −1450 to −1425 of the mouse S14 gene (corresponding to mut3) conferred a glucose response even in the absence of other regulatory sequences. This result indicate that this site functions as a ChoRE in the hepatocyte. Surprisingly, the mouse S14 ChoRE did not contain two E box motifs separated by 5 bp as had been found in previously identified ChoREs from the rat S14 and the L-PK genes (22.Shih H.-M. Liu Z. Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21991-21997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The lack of clearly distinguishable E box motifs in the mouse S14 ChoRE led us to investigate which sequences within this region are critical for the glucose response. Consequently, five point mutations of 2 bp were introduced across the ChoRE sequence (Fig. 5 A). In particular, we targeted CA (or TG) dinucleotides that might represent portions of degenerate E box sequences. Oligonucleotides containing these mutations were linked in three copies to the PK(−96)CAT construct to test for glucose responsiveness. Only two of the mutant constructs, 3-2 and 3-4, showed significant reductions in glucose-stimulated promoter activity (Fig. 5 B). Examination of the sequences surrounding these inactivating mutations revealed that each was part of a potential E box half site: CACG (for 3-2) and CAGC (for 3-4). Further scrutiny of both the rat S14 and PK ChoREs reveals that each also contains two potential E box half sites related to CACG (see “Discussion”). To test if this E box ‘half site’ might represent an essential element for the glucose response, an additional mutation was introduced into the mouse S14 ChoRE to substitute GC in the second putative E box half site with CG, generating a CACG sequence. This mutated construct, 3-6, retained its ability to confer a strong response to glucose. Thus, the presence of two E box half sites related to the sequence CACG may be the critical determinants for mediating the glucose response. To search for the specific nuclear factor that is responsible for the glucose response of the mouse S14ChoRE, rat liver nuclear extracts were prepared, fractionated by PEG precipitation, and used for EMSA with a mouse S14 ChoRE probe. Using the fraction precipitated between 0 and 6.7% PEG, three complexes, designated bands x, y, and z, were observed (Fig.6). The same three bands were detected with unfractionated nuclear extract, although the intensities of bands x and y were much lower relative to band z prior to fractionation. To determine whether any of these bands might be a candidate for the carbohydrate-responsive complex, the six mutant mouse S14ChoREs tested above were used for EMSA. Among the three bands detected with the wild type mouse S14 ChoRE, only the slowest migrating band (band"

To date the redox properties of Helicobacter pylori have received little attention. Accumulating evidence indicates that the redox status of cells controls various cellular functions including cellular activation and proliferation in addition to growth inhibition and apoptosis (for reviews, see Refs. 1.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Gleason F.K. Holmgren A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 54: 271-298Crossref Google Scholar, 3.Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M.

Cellular redox status is maintained by intracellular redox-regulating molecules, including thioredoxin (Trx),1 glutaredoxin, and protein disulfide isomerase, which catalyze the formation and reduction of disulfide bonds in proteins. The redox protein Trx and the associated enzyme thioredoxin reductase (TR) constitute a thiol-dependent reduction-oxidation system that can catalyze the reduction of certain proteins by NADPH, usually with high selectivity (1.Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In anaerobic bacteria, the generation of low redox potential reductants, such as Trx, can be used to assist electron flow to specific substrates. The capacity with which a given Trx can participate in this process is governed largely by the redox potential of the molecule. This in turn is directly associated with the nature of the amino acid residues flanked by 2 redox active vicinal cysteines in the active site. These cysteine residues participate in various redox reactions resulting in the catalysis of dithiol-disulfide exchange reactions. This CXXC motif has been termed elegantly as a molecular rheostat (6.Chivers P.T. Prehoda K.E. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4061-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), whereby the resulting family of thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases vary greatly in their redox potential and therefore their ability to assist electron flow. Thioredoxin reductase catalyzes the reduction of oxidized thioredoxin (Trx-S2) by NADPH, and reduced thioredoxin (Trx-(SH)2) is the disulfide reductase. Typically, enzymes of this family contain 2 identical protein subunits, each subunit containing one redox-active disulfide, 1 mol of FAD per subunit, and conserved FAD and NAD(P)H binding motifs. The flavin moiety mediates the transfer of reducing equivalents from NADPH to the disulfide bond of thioredoxin. We sought to identify and characterize processes in the gastric pathogen H. pylori which were susceptible to redox regulation, with an overall view to exploring the effects of the bacterium's redox environment on pathogenic mechanisms in addition to studying the effects of host factors on the redox activity of the bacterium. Initially we focused on members of the thioredoxin superfamily and specifically the Trx system. Here we describe the purification, overexpression, and characterization of the Trx system from H. pylori.

The reference strain of H. pylori used in this study (NCTC 11638, VacA+ and CagA+) was obtained from the National Collection of Type Cultures, Public Health Laboratory, London, U.K. All components for H. pylori culture media were obtained from Oxoid, Unipath Ltd., Basingstoke, Hampshire, U.K. H. pyloriwas grown under microaerobic conditions (Oxoid Campylobacter system, 5% O2, 10% CO2) for 4 days on 7% lysed horse blood Columbia agar at 37 °C. Cells were harvested into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). The cells were washed twice by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 5 min, 4 °C) in the appropriate buffer before use. Liquid cultures of H. pyloriwere grown in broth medium (10 ml) containing brain heart infusion, horse serum (5%, v/v), and yeast extract (0.25%, w/v) as described previously (55.Xia H.X. English L. Keane C.T. O'Morain C.A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1993; 46: 750-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The broth was supplemented with vancomycin (6 mg/liter), nalidixic acid (20 mg/liter), and amphotericin B (4 mg/liter) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The flasks were then sealed and incubated with constant agitation (120 rpm) for a further 72 h at 37 °C. Cultures were examined by a rapid urease test (phenol red) and by subculture to solid media (Columbia blood agar and Brain Heart infusion agar) with appropriate incubation to confirm the identity and purity of the broth cultures. In some experiments bovine anti-H. pylori IgG (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the broth culture. Samples (0.5 ml) of the broth culture were taken before and at various periods of time after the addition of antibody. H. pylori was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 3 min) and both the pellet of cells and the supernatant were retained and stored at −25 °C until required for analysis. Agar-grownH. pylori was suspended in buffer A (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5) and subjected to sonication (4 × 1 min bursts) on ice using a Branson sonifier 450. After centrifugation to remove intact cells and cellular debris (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) the resulting supernatant was applied to a DEAE-cellulose column (3.5 × 16 cm) equilibrated in buffer A. Thioredoxin reductase activity was eluted with a gradient (300 ml) of KCl (0–0.35m) in buffer A. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and applied to a Cibacron blue 3GA column (1 × 3 cm). TR was eluted with a gradient of KCl (0–0.4 m). Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed against buffer B, and applied to a small 2′,5′-ADP-agarose column (1 ml). Thioredoxin reductase was eluted upon application of 0.2m KCl. The ion exchange and dye affinity chromatography steps were performed at room temperature and the ADP-Sepharose step was done at 4 °C. A sonicate of H. pylori was prepared as described above and 0.5 ml (∼10 mg of protein/ml) of the material was applied to a column (diameter 1.5 cm; height 29.7 cm) of Sephacryl S-300 superfine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing NaN3 (0.02%, w/v). The protein was eluted with this same buffer (8.5 cm/h) and the collected fractions were assayed for both TR activity and total protein. The column was first calibrated with proteins of known molecular size (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Gel filtration over Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was performed also in PBS. Thioredoxin reductase activity was assayed at 25 °C in 0.1 mpotassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing EDTA (1 mm), 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (5 mm), and NADPH (0.2 mm) in a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme and the progress of the reaction was monitored by the increase in absorbance at 412 nm in a Pye Unicam 5625 spectrophotometer. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to oxidize 1 μmol of NADPH/min at 25 °C (pH 7.5). Activity was calculated as micromole of NADPH oxidized/min in accordance with the relationship ΔA 412/(13.6 × 2). Thioredoxin reductase activity was assayed also using a minor modification of the insulin reduction assay (11.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture consisted of 0.1m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing EDTA (1 mm), insulin (0.1 mg/ml), NADPH (0.2 mm), andH. pylori histidine-tagged Trx (2 μm) in a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition the enzyme to the mixture at 25 °C and the oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 340 nm. The amount of NADPH oxidized was determined from the relationship ΔA 340/6.2. Thioredoxin was purified by a combination of ion exchange chromatography on DEAE cellulose and gel filtration over Sephadex G-50. Fractions containing Trx were identified using the spectrophotometric insulin reduction assay (11.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission spectra of Trx were determined with a Jasco FP 750 spectrofluorimeter by excitation at 280 nm and emission was recorded from 290 to 390 nm. All measurements were performed in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.3) containing EDTA (1 mm) and Trx (15 μg/ml) at 25 °C. To prevent oxidation of Trx, all solutions were sparged with N2. Complete reduction of Trx was achieved by the addition of DTT (1 mm). Transformants of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS with plasmid pET-16b (Novagen) containing the Trx gene (HP 824) were grown at 37 °C in LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml). H. pylori Trx was expressed as an NH2-terminal decahistidine fusion protein in E. coli. The gene coding for Trx was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using ExpandTM (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), using the amplification conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Under these conditions a single product was obtained and this was cloned into the expression plasmid via the BamHI and NdeI restriction sites. The following primers were used: forward primer, 5′-CGCCATATGAGTCACTATATTGAATTAAC-3′; reverse primer 5′-CGCGGATCCGCCTAAGAGTTTGTTCAATTG-3′. Overexpression of the fusion protein was induced by adding 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside at exponential phase and the incubation continued for 3 h at 37 °C. The induced cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and subjected to sonication (3 × 1 min). The soluble fusion protein was purified to homogeneity by metal chelate chromatography on a Ni2+ column (3 ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was eluted with 0.4 m imidazole in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 0.5 mNaCl. Typically, 2–3 mg of homogenous Trx/100 ml of culture was obtained by this procedure. Both the histidine-tagged fusion protein and the recombinant Trx obtained after cleavage of the histidine tail by Factor Xa were indistinguishable in their spectroscopic properties and redox behavior. Hyperimmune bovine anti-H. pyloriantiserum was raised in cows immunized with a sonicate prepared from agar grown H. pylori. The IgG fraction was obtained by purification on Protein G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard procedures. Anti-H. pylori thioredoxin antiserum was obtained from rabbits hyperimmunized with purified recombinant H. pylori thioredoxin using standard procedures. Anti-E. coli thioredoxin antiserum was obtained commercially (Sigma). Proteins (soluble porcine submaxillary gland mucin and immunoglobulins) to be reduced by the H. pylori Trx system were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing EDTA (1 mm). The reaction was performed at room temperature. After various periods of incubation the reaction mixture was subjected to alkylation by the addition of 4-fold molar excess iodoacetamide (in N2-sparged 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.8)) over sulfhydryls to the sample. The mixture was left to incubate for 15 min under N2 in the dark after which time an equal volume of double strength nonreducing sample buffer was added and the mixture boiled for 5 min prior to SDS-PAGE on 5–20% acrylamide gradient gels. The actual amounts and concentrations of the various components of the reaction are given in the figure legends where appropriate. Typically, the reaction was initiated by the addition of 3 μmimmunoglobulin (Ig) to a mixture of recombinant H. pyloriTrx (3-fold molar excess over Ig), TR (0.1 μm), and NADPH (400 μm). Samples of the reaction mixture (10 μl) were withdrawn at the times indicated in the figure legends and processed as described above. Gels were stained either with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or processed for Western blotting. Reduction of porcine submaxillary gland mucin was performed in a similar manner to that described for Igs and the reaction was monitored both spectrophotometrically (NADPH consumption) and by SDS-PAGE. Weakly cell-associated or soluble proteins were obtained by gently mixing a suspension of freshly harvested cells in PBS prior to centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) to remove whole cells. The resulting supernatant was sterile filtered (0.2 μm Acrodisc, low protein binding) and stored at −70 °C. Membrane and cytosolic protein fractions were prepared essentially as described previously (9.Windle H.J. Kelleher D. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 3132-3137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Urease activity was measured spectrophotometrically exactly as described previously (75.Mobley H.L.T. Cortesia M.J. Rosenthal L.E. Jones B.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 831-836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin was detected in broth culture supernatants by coating ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp) with 50 μl of broth medium (concentrated 4-fold) overnight at 4 °C. Following washing (PBS) and blocking (3% BSA in PBS), bound thioredoxin was specifically detected by incubating the appropriate wells with polyclonal anti-H. pylori thioredoxin antiserum (1/1000) for 2 h at room temperature in a humidified atmosphere. After incubation with swine anti-rabbit IgG (1/1000; peroxidase conjugated) for 1 h at room temperature the bound conjugate was incubated with the substrate 3′,3′,5′,5′-tetramethylbenzidine according to the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). Multiple sequence alignments were made with the Clustal program. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of purifiedH. pylori Trx and TR was performed by Aine Healy at the National Food Biotechnology Center, University College Cork, using an Applied Biosystems automated sequencer. Thioredoxin from H. pylori was purified to homogeneity in a two-step procedure which involved ion exchange on DEAE-cellulose followed by gel filtration over Sephadex G-50. An SDS-PAGE analysis of a sample taken from each step in the purification procedure is shown in Fig. 1(panel A). Detection of Trx during its purification was based on its ability to reduce insulin disulfides, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Thioredoxin from H. pyloriexists as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 12 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. The NH2-terminal 20 amino acid residues for Trx were found to be MSHYIELTEEXFESTIKKGV, where X represents an unidentified residue. A search of the protein data bases confirmed that we had purified Trx, entry HP 0824 in the H. pylori genome data base (12.Tomb J-F. White O. Kerlavage A.R. Clayton R.A. Sutton G.G. Fleischman R.D. Ketchum K.A. et al.Nature. 1997; 388: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (3038) Google Scholar). Subcellular distribution studies demonstrated that Trx from H. pylori is largely a cytoplasmic protein (Fig. 1,panel C) with a small proportion of the total protein associated with the inner membrane fraction of the cell (not shown). Interestingly, Trx was detected in the soluble extracellular fraction which was obtained by briefly suspending the bacteria in PBS to remove loosely cell-associated material (Fig. 1, panel C, lane 4). Routinely, 2–3 mg of recombinant Trx was obtained per 100 ml of broth culture and the protein was expressed exclusively as a soluble cytoplasmic protein inE. coli. Removal of the His-tag from the purified material was achieved by digestion with Factor Xa (25 μg/mg protein) for 16 h at room temperature. To terminate the reaction the Factor Xa was removed from the mixture by passage through a small (1 ml) benzamidine-agarose column followed by purification of the recombinant protein (minus His-tag) on a Ni2+ column. Removal of the histidine tag resulted in a 2-kDa decrease in the molecular mass of the protein. The fluorescence emission spectra of the native and recombinant Trxs were determined for both the reduced and oxidized forms of the protein. The spectral characteristics of the reduced forms of the native and recombinant protein (+His-tag) were identical as were those of their oxidized forms (not shown). The reduction of the recombinant H. pylori Trx by DTT (1 mm) resulted in a 1.8-fold increase in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity at 343 nm following excitation at 280 nm (Fig.2). It has been demonstrated previously that thioredoxin from E. coli shows a larger increase in fluorescence intensity (3.5-fold) upon reduction of the active site cysteines due to the quenching effect of the active site disulfide on the fluorescence of an adjacent tryptophan (13.Stryer L. Holmgren A. Reichard P. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1016-1020Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ability of H. pylori Trx to catalyze the reduction of insulin by DTT was determined. Insulin reduction can be measured spectrophotometrically as an increase in turbidity due to precipitation of the free insulin B chain (88.Holgrem A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have compared the rates of porcine insulin reduction by DTT in the presence of H. pylori and E. coli Trxs. Both Trxs show activity as disulfide reductases with insulin as substrate (Fig.3, panel A). Interestingly, Trx from H. pylori was approximately four times as efficient at reducing insulin than equivalent amounts of E. coli Trx when incubated with DTT (Fig. 3). In addition, the initial rate of insulin reduction was greater with H. pylori Trx compared with Trx from E. coli. These observed redox activities (Fig.3) and the differential spectral properties of reduced and oxidized Trx (Fig. 2) enabled us to examine the oxidation of fully reduced Trx by insulin and to assay the process continuously using a fluorimeter. Fluorescence spectroscopy of reduced thioredoxin re-oxidation by insulin demonstrated that the process occurred rapidly upon addition of an equal amount of insulin (Fig. 3, panel B) and that the thioredoxin was oxidized within 2 min of the initiation of the reaction. Taken together, these data indicate that we had a functional recombinant molecule which behaved in a manner identical to the purified native Trx. Thioredoxin reductase was purified to homogeneity using a three-step purification procedure involving ion-exchange chromatography over DEAE-cellulose, Cibacron blue 3GA, and affinity purification over 2′-5′-ADP-agarose. During purification the activity of TR was monitored by its ability to catalyze NADPH-dependent reduction of the disulfide bond in 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as described previously (11.Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reductase activity eluted as a distinct sharp peak from DEAE-cellulose upon the application of a salt gradient. Active fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and applied to a small column of Cibacron blue 3GA and eluted in a highly purified form with KCl. Finally, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography over 2′,5′-ADP-agarose. An SDS-PAGE electrophoretic profile of each step in the purification procedure is shown in Fig. 1(panel B). A native molecular mass of approximately 70,000 Da was determined for TR on a calibrated column of Sephacryl S-300 (results not shown). The apparent molecular mass determined by analytical reducing SDS-PAGE of the purified activity was 35 kDa (Fig.1, panel B, lane 4) thus indicating that the H. pylori enzyme consists of two identical or similar subunits held together by a disulfide bond. NH2-terminal amino acid analysis of this peptide yielded the sequence MIDXAIIGGGPAGLXAGLYA, where Xrepresents an unidentified residue. This sequence corresponds to entry HP 825 in the H. pylori genome data base. The pure enzyme (TR) obtained after affinity chromatography on 2′,5′-ADP-agarose showed absorption maxima at 290, 350, and 420 nm (not shown). Thioredoxin reductase from H. pylori was strictly dependent on NADPH and was inactive in the presence of NADH (not shown), a feature common to most thioredoxin reductases described to date. In addition, the thioredoxin reductase reaction (Trx-S2 + NADPH + H+ ↔ Trx-(SH)2 + NADP+) was reversible by addition of excess NADP+ (not shown). The alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences encoded by the trxB gene from H. pylori and other selected species is shown in Fig.4 A. Greatest homology (>51%) between H. pylori Trx and Trx from other species is seen with Bacillus subtilis, Saccharomyces aureus,Anabaena sp., and the red alga Cyanidium caldarium. The redox-active site CGPC of Trx is highly conserved. Interestingly, Trx shares good homology to Trx from B. subtilis, recently shown to be an essential protein for the organism which is induced by multiple stresses (87.Scharf C. Riethdorf S. Ernst H. Engelmann S. Volker U. Hecker M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1869-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other handH. pylori TR is most homologous (44%) to TR fromClostridium litorale (not shown). In addition, the H. pylori enzyme possesses 2 conserved motifs responsible for binding of FAD near the NH2 terminus (GXGXXG) and NADPH near the middle of the protein (GGGDXA) as well as a redox active center (CATC). There is a fourth conserved domain with no homology to known motifs, located at the COOH terminus of the protein (GXFAAGD) (not shown). In order to study the patterns of reduction of human Igs, samples were reduced and alkylated over various periods of time and analyzed by both SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fig.5 (panel A) shows the results obtained when human polyclonal IgG was reduced by the Trx system ofH. pylori. Overall the SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that IgG was reduced almost to completion with time. In addition to the intact immunoglobulin (H2L2,M r: 146,000–170,000) and the major fragments of heavy (H, M r: 51,000–60,000) and light (L,M r: 22,000–25,000) chains, the small number of minor bands, which appear transiently, presumably represent the formation of mixed disulfides (e.g. H2L,M r: 124,000–145,000; H2,M r: 102,000–120,000; HL, 73,000–85,000) and these are identified in the margins of the figures, where appropriate. It is clear that human IgG is an efficient substrate for this system. IgG was completely reduced after a 3-h incubation (at room temperature) using equimolar amounts of Trx and Ig in the presence of TR and NADPH. Similarly, an identical cleavage pattern of IgG was observed when"

These proteins all contain a highly conserved region known as the Rel homology domain that is responsible for both protein dimerization and binding to DNA. In mammalian cells, the NF-κB family of proteins can be divided into two classes as follows: one class includes p50 and p52, both of which are produced constitutively by the proteasome-mediated removal of the COOH termini of the precursor proteins p105 and p100, respectively (22.Kieran M.

The degradation of phosphorylated IκBα, like the generation of p50 and p52, requires ubiquitination and the proteasome processing pathway (7.Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). The COOH terminus of p105 (p105C) contains ankyrin repeats and bears a striking resemblance to IκBα (39.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem.

The lymphoid cell-specific IκBγ protein is identical to p105C; however, this protein is generated by either alternative splicing or promoter usage (39.Blank V. Kourilsky P. Israel A. Trends Biochem.

It mediates the generation of the p50 and p52 subunits, thereby allowing them to compose heterodimers with p65, and it degrades the phosphorylated inhibitory subunit, IκBα. Both proteasome steps thereby allow the active NF-κB heterodimers entry into the nucleus (47.Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar, 48.Chen Z.J. Parent L. Maniatis T.

The sites of phosphorylation and of ubiquitination of IκBα have been identified, and the kinase complex responsible for IκBα phosphorylation contains IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ and has been isolated and characterized (36.Maniatis T. Science. 1997; 278: 818-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 37.Zandi E. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4547-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 38.Verma I.M. Stevenson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11758-11760Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). NF-κB activation plays an important role in suppression of TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Mice lacking p65 die before birth on day 14 to 15 of gestation, apparently because of massive and accelerated liver cell death (14.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from these p65−/− animals undergo apoptosis when exposed to TNF-α (13.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar), due to a defect in the activation of NF-κB in response to this cytokine (13.Beg A.A. Baltimore D.

Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). Furthermore, introduction of a dominant-negative IκBα into cells or overexpression of IκBα prevents NF-κB activation and results in cell death on exposure to TNF-α (14.Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T.

Culturing intact cells with various proteasome inhibitors also results in a marked potentiation of TNF-α-induced cell death (56.Cui H. Matusi K. Omura S. Schaver S.L. Matulka R.A. Sonenshein G.E. Ju S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7515-7520Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have now investigated proteasome function, NF-κB activation, and susceptibility to TNF-α-induced apoptosis in T2 cells, a human lymphocyte cell line in which the genes for the proteasome subunits LMP2 and LMP7 have been genetically deleted. The activity of NF-κB in T2 cells was markedly impaired, a result of a virtual lack of p50 and p52 caused by defective proteasomal processing of the corresponding precursor proteins. Furthermore these cells were defective in their ability to degrade phosphorylated IκBα and showed a marked susceptibility to TNF-α-induced cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that, in human lymphocytes, LMP2 and LMP7 are required for the generation and activation of NF-κB as well as for prevention of TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Lymphocyte cell lines used in this study included Molt-4, Jurkat, T1, and T2 cells. All were purchased through ATCC (Manassas, VA) except T2 cells, which were a kind gift from Dr. Peter Cresswell (New Haven, CT). T2 cells are a mutant derived from T1 cells; they lack a large segment of chromosome 6 that encodes HLA class II genes, the Lmp2 andLmp7 proteasome genes, and the ATPase peptide transportersTap1 and Tap2. Fresh normal murine lymphocytes from spleens were harvested from 6-week-old Balb/c or Lmp2−/− mice. BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories; Lmp2−/− mice were a generous donation from Dr. Luc Van Kaer (Nashville, TN). All antibodies were purchased through Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or Oncogene Research Laboratories (Cambridge, MA). Cells (1 × 107) were harvested, collected by centrifugation for 15 min at 3000 rpm, washed with 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and again collected by centrifugation. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 4 ml of solution A (10 mmHepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 10 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and then incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After addition of 250 μl of 10% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, the cell suspension was vigorously mixed, incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm. The resulting supernatant was saved as the cytosolic extract (protein concentration, 35 μg/μl), and the pellet was resuspended in 1.5 ml of solution C (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 50 mm KCl, 300 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The suspension was mixed for 30 min at 4 °C and centrifuged for 15 min at 3,000 rpm. The supernatant from this centrifugation was saved as the nuclear extract (protein concentration, 20 μg/μl). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were prepared by the phosphoramidate method with a DNA synthesizer and purified on an OPC cartridge (Life Technologies, Inc.). They correspond to wild-type κB (5′-GATCTAGGGACTTT CCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAG) and mutant (mutant 1, 5′-GATCTACTCACTTTCCGCTGCTCACTTTCCAG; mutant 2, 5′-GATCTAGTCACTTTCCGC TGGTCACTT TCCAG) κB binding motifs of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1 κB) enhancer. The oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow polymerase. For EMSA analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 10 μl containing 10 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, 15 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 4 ng of 32P-labeled wild-type HIV-1 κB oligonucleotide. The resulting DNA-protein complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on nondenaturing 8% polyacrylamide gels with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 4 °C. For competition experiments, the nuclear extracts were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C with a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled HIV-1 κB oligonucleotide before addition of the radioactive probe. For supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were incubated with specific antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C before addition of the DNA probe. Cytosolic extracts were exposed to final concentrations of 1.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and 0.8% (w/v) deoxycholate to induce dissociation of IκB from NF-κB before incubation with 32P-labeled probe (21.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 57.Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol.

AP1 and SP1 binding activities were examined by EMSA analysis as described (59.Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R.

Nature. 1989; 341: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Nuclear or cytosolic extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) on 12.5% gels under nonreducing conditions. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, which was then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mmNaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 8% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. The membrane was subsequently incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with TBS-T containing the appropriate polyclonal antibodies, washed four times with TBS-T for 15 min each time at room temperature, incubated for 2 h at room temperature with TBS-T containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, washed five times with TBS-T, and subjected to the alkaline phosphatase color reaction by standard method. The in vitro p50 processing was assayed as described previously (44.Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In brief, the pcDNA1p105 construct was subjected to transcription and translation in vitro with wheat germ extract (Promega, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine. The35S-labeled p105 protein was then immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies to p50 and purified. The substrate protein was incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with cytosolic extract (20 or 40 μg of protein) in a final volume of 25 μl in the absence or presence of 10 mm ATP (46.Palombella V. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The proteasome inhibitor MG115 (Sigma) was preincubated with cytosolic extracts before the substrate protein was also added to the reaction mixture. The proteolytic products were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and visualized by autoradiography. The reporter plasmids, IL-2Rα-κB wt, IL-2Rα-κB mut, and RSV-LTR were used in the luciferase experiments. In these constructs, the luciferase gene is driven by the interleukin-2 receptor-α-chain (IL-2Rα) promoter or the Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat (RSV-LTR). The reporter plasmid (10 μg), IL-2Rα-κB wt, IL-2Rα-κB mut, or RSV-LTR were co-transfected into T1, T2, Molt-4, or Jurkat cells by the DEAE-dextran standard method using 1 μg of a RSV-galactosidase expression vector as an internal control. In IL-2Rα-κB wt, the κB sequence GGGGAATCTCCC was substituted by GCTCAATCTCCC. The cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h after transfection and then TNF-α (final concentration, 10 ng/ml) was added to each plate. After an additional 4 h of culture with TNF-α, the cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed. The luciferase activities of equal amounts of extracted proteins were measured by standard methods. To adjust the transfection efficiency, quantitation of the β-galactosidase was carried out by the standard method. Values are shown as the mean ± S.E. of three independent transcription experiments. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and exposed to TNF-α for various times. The number of viable cells was determined by trypan blue exclusion as described (13.Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2935) Google Scholar). We first investigated the effect that deletions of the HLA-linkedLmp2 and Lmp7 proteasome subunit genes might have on NF-κB function by EMSA with the nuclear extracts prepared from T2 cells. These cells were cultured in the absence or presence of TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 4 h. Nuclear extracts from parental T1 cells and from human T cell lymphoma Molt-4 and Jurkat cells were also assayed for comparison. Whereas T1, Molt-4, and Jurkat cells all showed marked increases in nuclear κB binding activity after exposure to TNF-α, T2 cells exhibited no such response (Fig.1 A). The specificity of the observed κB binding in the nuclear extracts of TNF-α-treated cells was confirmed by binding activity assessed with 32P-labeled probe. The DNA binding activity was completely inhibited by preincubation of the extracts with a 100-fold molar excess of the corresponding (wild type) unlabeled κB oligonucleotide; similar preincubation with two different oligonucleotides in which the κB binding motif was mutated did not inhibit binding activity measured with the labeled probe (Fig. 1 B). The κB binding activity of cytosolic extracts was also examined by EMSA after treatment of the extracts with detergents (Nonidet P-40 and deoxycholate) to induce dissociation of IκB from NF-κB (21.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 57.Hayashi T. Ueno Y. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11380-11388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,58.Hayashi T. Sekine T. Okamoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26790-26795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, the κB binding activity of cytosolic extracts from T2 cells was greatly inactivated relative to the κB binding activity detected in cytosolic extracts from T1, Molt-4, or Jurkat cells (Fig.1 C). The nuclear DNA binding activities of the transcription factors SP1 and AP1 did not differ among the four cell types studied (Fig. 1 D). Together, these observations suggest that NF-κB activation in response to TNF-α is defective in T2 cells. To identify the NF-κB subunits responsible for the observed κB binding activity, we performed supershift assays. Preincubations of nuclear extracts from T1, Molt-4, or Jurkat cells with polyclonal antibodies to p50 resulted in a shift in the DNA-protein complex to a position of lower mobility; however, no such shift in mobility was detectable with the DNA-protein complex formed by nuclear extracts from T2 cells (Fig.2 A). In contrast, pretreatment of the nuclear extracts from all four cell lines with polyclonal antibodies to p65 reduced the mobility of the DNA-protein complex in every case (Fig. 2 A). As a negative control, polyclonal antibodies to the transcription factor C/EBP had no effect on the mobility of the DNA-protein complex formed by nuclear extracts of each of the four cell lines (Fig. 2 A). Aberrant p52 proteins are found in lymphocytes, as a result of chromosome rearrangements at the NFKB2 locus (27.Neri A. Chang C.C. Lombardi L. Salina M. Corradini P."
https://openalex.org/W1994569839,"DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) isolated fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe (sp) consists of at least four subunits, Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1. We have reconstituted the four-subunit complex by simultaneously expressing these polypeptides in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The properties of the purified cloned spPol δ were identical to the native spPol δ isolated fromS. pombe cells. In addition, we also isolated a three-subunit complex containing Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdm1. Both three- and four-subunit complexes required replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen for DNA replication. However, in the presence of low levels of polymerase complexes, the three-subunit complex was less efficient than the four-subunit complex in supporting DNA replication. The inefficient synthesis of DNA by the three-subunit complex can be remedied by the addition of Cdc27, the subunit missing in the three-subunit complex. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated that the three-subunit complex is a monomer of the heterotrimer (Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdm1) and that the four-subunit complex is a dimer of the heterotetramer (Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1), similar to the structure of native spPol δ. We have further shown that Cdc1 and Cdc27 interact to form a heterodimeric complex. Gel filtration studies indicate that the structure of this complex is dimeric. These observations suggest that the Cdc27 subunit may play an important role contributing to the dimerization of Pol δ. DNA polymerase δ (Pol δ) isolated fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe (sp) consists of at least four subunits, Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1. We have reconstituted the four-subunit complex by simultaneously expressing these polypeptides in baculovirus-infected insect cells. The properties of the purified cloned spPol δ were identical to the native spPol δ isolated fromS. pombe cells. In addition, we also isolated a three-subunit complex containing Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdm1. Both three- and four-subunit complexes required replication factor C and proliferating cell nuclear antigen for DNA replication. However, in the presence of low levels of polymerase complexes, the three-subunit complex was less efficient than the four-subunit complex in supporting DNA replication. The inefficient synthesis of DNA by the three-subunit complex can be remedied by the addition of Cdc27, the subunit missing in the three-subunit complex. Gel filtration analysis demonstrated that the three-subunit complex is a monomer of the heterotrimer (Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdm1) and that the four-subunit complex is a dimer of the heterotetramer (Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1), similar to the structure of native spPol δ. We have further shown that Cdc1 and Cdc27 interact to form a heterodimeric complex. Gel filtration studies indicate that the structure of this complex is dimeric. These observations suggest that the Cdc27 subunit may play an important role contributing to the dimerization of Pol δ.

The replicative functions of Pol α and Pol δ have been defined primarily from studies carried out with purified mammalian proteins in the SV40 DNA replication pathway (3.Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc.

Due to its association with SV40 large tumor antigen (the only viral component required in this system) and replication protein A (RPA), Pol α and its tightly associated DNA primase complex are responsible for the synthesis of RNA-DNA primers that initiate DNA synthesis on the leading strand and each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand (6.Conaway R.C.

The extent of synthesis catalyzed by Pol α appears limited and extends for a relatively short distance (∼30–40 nucleotides), leading to the formation of pre-Okazaki fragments (13.Nethanel T. Reisfeld S. Dinter-Gottlieb G. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5912-5918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Bullock P.A. Seo Y.-S. Hurwitz J. Mol. Cell.

Recent studies have shown that the Pol α-primase complex is stabilized on initiator DNA fragments by RPA, and its displacement is mediated by the clamp loader RFC which in the presence of ATP loads PCNA onto the primed termini of DNA (10.Surimoto T. Melendy T. Stillman B. Nature. 1990; 346: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 17.Yuzhakov A. Kelman Z. Hurwitz J. O'Donnell M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6189-6199Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The subsequent processive elongation of the leading strand and the maturation of pre-Okazaki fragments are catalyzed by Pol δ. Thus, Pol δ is responsible for leading strand synthesis and the maturation of pre-Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (7- 9, 18). In the SV40 replication pathway, Pol ε appears to play no role;in vitro, Pol ε supported SV40 DNA replication poorly compared with Pol δ (19.Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Burger P.M.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo cross-linking experiments further indicated that Pol ε plays no role in SV40 DNA replication (20.Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jian Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanal T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2298-2305Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast to the SV40 replication pathway, both Pol δ and Pol ε are strongly implicated in the elongation phase of chromosomal DNA replication (1.Waga S. Stillman B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2.Burgers P.M.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Like Pol δ, Pol ε isolated from S. cerevisiae and mammalian cells requires RFC and PCNA for processive DNA synthesis in vitro (19.Lee S.-H. Kwong A.D. Pan Z.-Q. Burger P.M.J. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22707-22715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Zlotkin T. Kaufmann G. Jian Y. Lee M.Y. Uitto L. Syvaoja J. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Nethanal T.

However, how these two polymerases act to coordinate the synthesis of both leading and lagging strands is unclear. Based on genetic and biochemical studies, it has been suggested that Pol δ supports leading strand synthesis, and Pol ε is responsible for lagging strand synthesis (2.Burgers P.M.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1998; 107: 218-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the reverse model has also been advanced. More recent studies in S. cerevisiae have shown that although Pol ε may play an enzymatic role during DNA replication, this function does not appear essential, whereas the essential function of Pol ε is provided by its non-catalytic C-terminal domain (22.Kesti T. Flick K. Keranen S. Syvaoja J.E. Wittenburg C. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 23.Dua R. Levy D.L. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22283-22288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Cells in which the polymerase catalytic domains of Pol ε were deleted are viable. We have investigated the properties of Pol δ isolated from S. pombe. Based on biochemical and genetic studies, highly purified spPol δ was shown to contain at least four distinct subunits, a large catalytic subunit Pol3, and three smaller subunits Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 with molecular masses of 125, 51, 42, and 19 kDa, respectively (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 25.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S.

Genet. 1998; 34: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We initially identified a fifth subunit of 42 kDa associated with spPol δ, but we later found that it was a contaminant that comigrated with spPol δ activity through a number of chromatographic steps as well as glycerol gradient centrifugation. The demonstration that spPol δ contained four subunits is in accord with earlier genetic and interaction studies that indicated that Pol3 (also referred to as p125) interacted with Cdc1, Cdc1 interacted with Cdc27, and thatcdm1 rescued cells temperature-sensitive in eitherpol3, cdc1, or cdc27 (25.MacNeill S.A. Moreno S. Reynolds N. Nurse P. Fantes P.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4613-4628Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Genetic studies inS. pombe have shown that Pol3, Cdc1, and Cdc27 proteins are essential, whereas Cdm1 is not (26.Reynolds N. Watt A. Fantes P.A. MacNeill S.A. Curr. Genet. 1998; 34: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). ScPol δ contains three subunits, scPol3, Pol31, and Pol32 (molecular masses of 125, 58 and 55 kDa, respectively), that are homologues of spPol3, Cdc1, and Cdc27 (27.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28.Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), respectively. Mammalian Pol δ was initially reported to be a heterodimer of subunits of 125 and 55 kDa (29.Lee M.Y.W.T. Tan C.-K. Downey K.M. So A.G. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1906-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 30.Jiang Y.Q. Zhang S.J. Wu S.M. Lee M.Y.W.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 320: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) which are homologues of spPol3 and Cdc1. However, a third subunit (of molecular mass 66 kDa) has been discovered recently which appears to be a homologue of Cdc27 (31.Hughes P. Tratner I. Dueouz M. Piard K. Baldacci G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2108-2114Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that mammalian Pol δ is likely to contain at least three distinct subunits. To date, the Pol δ complex isolated from S. cerevisiae has been the best characterized enzyme (27.Gerik K.J. Li X. Pautz A. Burgers P.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19747-19755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 28.Burgers P.M.J. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). scPol δ is a dimer of the three subunits scPol3, Pol31, and Pol32. The Pol32 subunit, which strongly interacts with scPCNA, appears responsible for the dimerization of the complex. Two forms of scPol δ were isolated when the genes encoding the Pol δ subunits were overexpressed in S. cerevisiae. These included a two-subunit form that contained Pol3 and Pol31 and the three-subunit holoenzyme complex. When analyzed for their ability to support elongation of primed templates, the two-subunit form (Pol3–Pol31) was less processive than the three-subunit form (Pol3–Pol31–Pol32). DNA synthesis catalyzed by the two-subunit complex resulted in the accumulation of small DNA fragments, most likely reflecting the dissociation of Pol δ when the complex encountered regions in the DNA template possessing secondary structure. In contrast, the three-subunit complex was more processive in its action. Here, we describe the reconstitution of the spPol δ complex in baculovirus-infected insect cells. We have isolated two forms of spPol δ. One contained the four subunits p125, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 and the other the three subunits p125, Cdc1, and Cdm1. We have examined the structure and enzymatic activities associated with these two complexes. Similar to scPol δ, both forms of the spPol δ supported PCNA-dependent replication of primed DNA templates, but the three-subunit complex catalyzed the synthesis of small sized products compared with the products formed with the four-subunit enzyme. Furthermore, the three-subunit form, which lacks Cdc27 (the homologue of scPol32), appears to be a monomer, whereas the four-subunit complex appears to be a dimer of the heterotetramer. We have also found that the Cdc27 protein alone is a tetramer which, upon interaction with the monomeric Cdc1 subunit, leads to the formation of a Cdc1-Cdc27 complex that is a dimer of the heterodimer. These observations suggest that Cdc27 and its scPol32 homologue may be important in the formation of dimeric structure of the four-subunit complex of spPol δ and the three-subunit complex of scPol δ, respectively. Poly(dA)4000 and oligo(dT)12–18 were obtained from Life Sciences (St. Petersburg, FL) and Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, respectively. Labeled and unlabeled dNTPs andEscherichia coli SSB were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SpPol δ and spRFC were purified from S. pombe cells, and recombinant spPCNA was isolated from E. coli as described previously (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies against the p125 subunit of spPol δ were generated by Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA) by immunizing rabbits with the 55-kDa C-terminal fragment of the p125 subunit (amino acids 658–1087). This region was constructed by cleavage of the cDNA with BglII and BamHI (immediately after the stop codon) followed by its insertion into theBamHI site of pET-16b (Novagene) which encodes a 10 histidine tag at the N terminus. The His10-tagged protein fragment was isolated following overexpression in E. coli. Antibodies against Cdc1, Cdc27 and Cdm1 were prepared as described previously (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The replication assay using poly(dA)4000·oligo(dT)12–18 was carried out as described previously (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). One unit of Pol δ activity supported the incorporation of 1 nmol of dTMP under the reaction conditions used in the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) assay (60 min at 37 °C). In experiments designed to evaluate the different forms of spPol δ, complexes were assayed for their ability to support the elongation of singly primed M13 DNA in the presence of spPCNA, spRFC, E. coli SSB, and ATP. The standard assay (20 μl) contained 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.01% BSA, 7 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dATP, dGTP, and dCTP, 20 μm[α-32P]dTTP (1–2 × 104 cpm/pmol), 6–10 fmol of singly primed M13 DNA, 0.25 μg of E. coliSSB, 50 ng of spPCNA (or as indicated), and approximately 20 fmol of spRFC and Pol δ. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C as indicated, halted with 10 mm EDTA, and separated by electrophoresis through an alkaline-agarose gel (1.5%) followed by autoradiography. For quantitation, an aliquot of the reaction mixture (2 μl) was spotted on DEAE-cellulose paper, and the amount of labeled nucleotide incorporated into DNA was determined. The conditions used for examining RFC-independent, PCNA-dependent DNA synthesis catalyzed by spPol δ were as follows: reaction mixtures (15 μl) containing 40 mmBicine-Tris buffer, pH 6.8, 60 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm DTT, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 30 μm[α-32P]dTTP (5–8000 cpm/pmol), 12.5 μmpoly(dA)4000·oligo(dT)12–18, spPCNA, and spPol δ, as indicated, were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed and used to determine the amount of poly(dT) synthesized. The cDNAs encoding Pol3, Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 were obtained from Dr. S. A. MacNeill (Edinburgh, UK). The cDNAs used to express Cdc1, Cdc27, and Cdm1 subunits were cloned so that the initiation of these three genes started with the sequenceX GGATCCACCATG which contains a BamHI site (underlined). Approximately 200–400 bp downstream of the stop codon, each of these genes contained another BamHI site. After BamHI digestion, the fragment of each gene was ligated into the BamHI site of pFastBac1 and pFastBacHTb which contained the sequence encoding a His6-tag at the N terminus (BAC-To-BAC Baculovirus Expression systems, Life Technologies, Inc.). The Pol3 + gene was also altered so that it contained BamHI sites flanking the entire coding sequence. A 5′ BamHI site was constructed 62 bp from the start codon, and another BamHI site was located at the 3′ end of the cDNA, immediately following a 30-bp poly(dT) sequence. TheBamHI fragment containing the entirePol3 + gene was also cloned into theBamHI site in pFastBac1 and pFastBacHTb (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression systems, Life Technologies, Inc.). All recombinant viruses were produced according to the manufacturer's instruction (BAC-TO-BAC Baculovirus Expression systems, Life Technologies, Inc.). Monolayer high five (HF) insect cells were grown at 27 °C to about 80% confluency in Grace's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HF cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were infected with a recombinant baculovirus encoding a single Pol δ subunit or infected simultaneously with two, three, or four viruses to produce various Pol δ complexes. The infected cells were maintained at 27 °C for 64 h and then harvested by centrifugation at 2500 rpm (1800 × g) for 15 min at 4 °C after which cell pellets were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For this purpose, insect cells were infected with all four viruses (each at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of five) of which only Cdc27 was N-terminally tagged with six histidine residues. The complex was also purified using the His6 tag on other subunits but with slightly lower yields (data not presented). The washed cell pellet (6 ml, from 1.95 × 108 cells) was resuspended in 4 volumes of buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml antipain, 1 mm pepstatin A, and 1 mmbenzamidine) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 per volume of packed cells followed by 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer and a brief sonication. Mixtures were centrifuged at 40,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min, and the supernatant (28 ml, 332 mg of protein) was then incubated with 1 ml of Ni2+ beads (Invitrogen) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 4 h and then centrifuged. The pelleted beads were washed four times with 10 ml of buffer A containing 50 mmimidazole and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. Bound proteins were eluted using buffer A containing 0.5 m imidazole. The eluted fraction (16 ml, 13 mg of protein, 49,000 units) was diluted to 0.05m NaCl with buffer A (to a volume of 65 ml) and loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column (2 ml, 1 × 2.8 cm). A linear 0.05 to 0.5m NaCl gradient (40 ml) was applied to the column, and fractions (1 ml) were collected. Fractions containing Pol δ activity (peaking at 0.2 m) were pooled (10 ml) and concentrated by centrifugation (Millipore) to 2.1 ml (4.2 mg of protein, 50,400 units, 12,000 units/mg protein). The major contaminant present in the SP-Sepharose fraction was the Cdc27-Cdc1 complex. In order to remove this complex the SP-Sepharose fraction was subjected to a sizing column step. The concentrated SP-Sepharose fraction (0.2 ml) was loaded onto a 24-ml Superdex-200 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was equilibrated and eluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. The column was run at a rate of 0.25 ml/min, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. The volume of buffer required to elute various protein markers from this column was as follows: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), 9.7 ml; ferritin (440 kDa), 10.75 ml; catalase (232 kDa), 12 ml; aldolase (158 kDa), 13 ml; BSA (68 kDa), 14.25 ml; ovalbumin (43 kDa), 15.5 ml; chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), 16.5 ml; and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa), 17.7 ml. Fractions containing polymerase activity, eluting between fractions 38 (9.5 ml) and 43 (10.75 ml), were pooled (1.5 ml). This step was repeated with the SP-Sepharose fraction, and the combined eluates (3 ml) were concentrated by centrifugation. If the entire SP-Sepharose fraction were carried through this step, 1.1 mg of protein (22,000 units/mg) would have been isolated. An aliquot (0.2 ml) of material eluted from the sizing column (0.3 mg/ml, 6600 units/ml) was layered onto a 5-ml 15–35% glycerol gradient in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 μg/ml of antipain, 1 mmpepstatin A, and 1 mm benzamidine. After centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 18 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor, 0.2-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. The distribution of proteins and Pol δ activity in these fractions was analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and in the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) assay, respectively. The peak of Pol δ activity was pooled, yielding 0.28 mg of protein containing 40,000 units/mg protein (assuming that all of the material had been carried through this step). Based on the Pol δ activity present in the material eluted from the Ni2+ column, the polymerase activity was purified approximately 10-fold with a 22% yield using the above procedure. The final pooled glycerol gradient fractions were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Although relatively stable, repeated freezing and thawing of the same sample resulted in a gradual decrease in activity (∼30% after 5 to 6 cycles). The preparation of the three-subunit complex was carried out by infection of insect cells (1.45 × 108) with viruses (m.o.i. of five for each virus used) encoding p125, Cdc1, and Cdm1 of which only Cdc1 was His6-tagged at its N terminus. The cell pellet (4 ml) was carried through similar steps described for the isolation of the four-subunit complex with the following modifications. The crude extract (19 ml, 240 mg of protein) was passed through 1 ml of Ni2+ (Invitrogen) column and yielded 4.4 mg of protein (8 ml) containing 11,200 units of Pol δ activity. After dilution to 0.05 m NaCl, the material was loaded onto a SP-Sepharose column (0.5 ml, 1 × 0.7 cm), and the bound material was eluted with 10 ml of a 0.05 to 0.5 mNaCl gradient, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected. Pol δ activity, eluting between fractions 14 and 25 (peaking at 0.25 m), was pooled (3 ml, 0.6 mg of protein containing 3700 units), concentrated to 0.55 mg/ml by centrifugation, and subjected to glycerol gradient centrifugation as described for the isolation of the four-subunit complex. If the entire SP-Sepharose fraction had been carried through this step, 0.13 mg of protein with a specific activity of 35,200 would have been obtained. The pooled glycerol gradient fraction was stored in aliquots of −80 °C. Repeated freezing and thawing resulted in the gradual loss of activity (50% loss after 6 cycles). The isolation of this complex was monitored by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Blue. Insect cells (1 × 108) infected with viruses (m.o.i. of five for each virus) encoding His6-tagged Cdc1 and Cdc27 (untagged) yielded 2 ml of pelleted cells that were subjected to homogenization, sonication, and centrifugation, as described for the isolation of the four-subunit Pol δ complex (yielding 8 ml of extract, 132 mg of protein). The extract was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ni2+ beads that yielded 6.6 mg of protein (6 ml) after elution with 0.5 m imidazole. This material was then loaded onto a 0.5-ml SP-Sepharose column that was eluted with a 0.05 to 0.5m NaCl gradient (total volume, 10 ml). Fractions containing Cdc1-Cdc27, which peaked at 0.3 m, were pooled (7 ml, 0.48 mg/ml) and concentrated by centrifugation (Milipore) to 1 ml (2.4 mg of protein/ml). Infection of insect cells with baculoviruses encoding Cdc1, Cdc27, or Cdm1 resulted in the isolation of soluble proteins, whereas a soluble p125 subunit was not obtained after infection with virus encoding Pol 3. Although the p125 subunit was expressed efficiently in insect cells, no soluble material was detected after elution of Ni2+ beads with 0.5 m imidazole. For the isolation of the individual subunits, insect cells (7 × 107 cells) were infected with a virus (at a m.o.i. of five) encoding either His6-Cdc1, His6-Cdc27, or His6-Cdm1. After extraction, Ni2+ binding (0.5 ml), and elution with 0.5 m imidazole, His6-Cdc1, (1.4 mg), His6-Cdc27 (0.9 mg), or His6-Cdm1 (1.5 mg) was obtained. The isolation and purity of these proteins were monitored by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Based on their amino acid content, Cdc1 and Cdc27 are polypeptides with molecular masses of 51 and 42 kDa, respectively. On SDS-PAGE analysis, Cdc1 migrates normally, whereas Cdc27 migrates aberrantly as a 50-kDa protein band (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl.

In the experiments described below, these materials were either further purified by sizing column fractionation or freed of imidazole by dialysis. All three protein preparations appeared to be homogeneous. In order to immunoprecipitate Pol δ complexes containing Cdc27, polyclonal antibodies against Cdc27 (1 μl of serum) were added, and mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were then adsorbed to protein A-agarose beads (5 μl) for 1 h at 4 °C with frequent shaking. The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1% BSA, twice with 1 ml of the same buffer without BSA, and once with 1 ml of the same buffer lacking BSA and NaCl. Proteins adsorbed to the beads were assayed for their ability to support DNA replication using the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) assay. In order to prevent beads from settling out during the assay, incubations were carried out using the “Eppendorf/Thermomixer” at 37 °C for 30 min. We constructed recombinant baculoviruses that produced the spPol δ subunits in insect cells. To reconstitute the four-subunit Pol δ complex, HF cells were co-infected with the four viruses, each expressing an individual Pol δ subunit. The Cdc27 subunit was His6-tagged at its N terminus to facilitate the isolation of the complex. Purification of the recombinant Pol δ from baculovirus-infected HF cells by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography yielded a complex that contained all four subunits. This complex was further purified by chromatography through SP-Sepharose, Superdex-200 gel filtration chromatography, and glycerol gradient sedimentation. After glycerol gradient centrifugation, both DNA polymerase activity (Fig. 1 A) and the distribution of the four protein subunits (Fig. 1 B) were coincidental with both peaking in fractions 10 and 11. In the poly(dA)·oligo(dT) replication assay, the specific activity of the four-subunit Pol δ complex isolated after glycerol gradient centrifugation was 40,000 units/mg, approximately 2-fold higher than Pol δ (20,300 units/mg) isolated from S. pombe cells (24.Zuo S. Gibbs E. Kelman Z. Wang T.S.-F. O'Donnell M. MacNeill S.A. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11244-11249Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We also isolated a three-subunit complex devoid of Cdc27 by co-infecting HF cells with baculoviruses expressing p125, His6-tagged Cdc1, and Cdm1. The three-subunit complex was purified to homogeneity by Ni2+ affinity, SP-Sepharose chromatography followed by glycerol gradient sedimentation. Polymerase activity (Fig. 1 C) and protein subunits constituting the complex (Fig. 1 D) both peak"

In contrast, the inducible NOS isoform binds calmodulin at low basal levels of calcium in resting cells. Primary sequence comparisons show that each constitutive NOS isozyme contains a polypeptide segment within its reductase domain, which is absent in the inducible NOS enzyme. To study a possible link between the presence of these additional polypeptide segments in constitutive NOS enzymes and their calcium-dependent calmodulin activation, three deletion mutants were created. The putative inhibitory insert was removed from the FMN binding regions of the neuronal NOS holoenzyme and from two truncated neuronal NOS reductase enzymes in which the calmodulin binding region was either included or deleted. All three mutant enzymes showed reduced incorporation of FMN and required reconstitution with exogenous FMN for activity. The combined removal of both the calmodulin binding domain and the putative inhibitory insert did not result in a calmodulin-independent neuronal NOS reductase. Thus, although the putative inhibitory element has an effect on the calcium-dependent calmodulin activation of neuronal NOS, it does not have the properties of the typical autoinhibitory domain found in calmodulin-activated enzymes.

The constitutively expressed neuronal NOS (nNOS, NOS-1) and endothelial NOS (eNOS, NOS-3) produce NO as an intercellular signal within the nervous and endothelial systems, respectively. These two constitutive NOS (cNOS) isoforms are controlled by the calcium-dependent binding of the regulatory protein calmodulin (CaM). The inducible NOS isoform (iNOS, NOS-2) binds CaM at basal levels of calcium (Ca2+) (3.Cho H.J. Xie Q. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M. Lee T.D. Nathan C. J. Exp.

The structure of all three isoforms of NOS can be divided into two domains, an NH2-terminal oxygenase (heme) domain and a COOH-terminal reductase (flavin) domain (5.Sheta E.A. McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15147-15153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Separating these two domains is the CaM binding region (6.Ruan J. Xie Q.-W. Hutchinson N. Cho H.

Heme and tetrahydrobiopterin are essential cofactors found in the oxygenase domain, which also contains the l-arginine binding site. FAD and FMN are essential cofactors found in the reductase domain, which also possesses a site for NADPH binding. Both the oxygenase and reductase domains of NOS are functionally independent and can be separated (either by enzymatic digestion or by recombinant means) from one another (7.Newton D.C.

The Ca2+-dependent CaM activation of cNOS enzymes and the Ca2+-independent activation of the iNOS isoform are maintained by their respective reductase domains (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J.

Although the CaM response is complete within the reductase domains of these enzymes, the Ca2+-independent activity of iNOS apparently depends on the interactions of CaM with the reductase domain and oxygenase domain, as well as the CaM binding region (6.Ruan J.

Sequence alignments of the flavin binding regions of flavoproteins and the NOS isoforms revealed that the cNOSs contain an extra 43–46 amino acids within their FMN binding domains (Fig.1) which are absent in iNOS, cytochrome P450 reductase, and flavodoxin (15.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.H. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

The additional amino acids in cNOS enzymes were proposed to be autoinhibitory elements that interfere with CaM binding (15.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.H. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Autoinhibitory domains have been reported in a number of CaM-dependent enzymes, including smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase, CaM-dependent protein kinase II, and calcineurin (17.James P.

Peptides derived from the putative autoinhibitory domain of eNOS, but not nNOS, inhibited CaM binding and Ca2+ activation of both nNOS and eNOS (15.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B.

To investigate the possibility that the 43-amino acid insert affects the Ca2+-dependent CaM activation of nNOS, this element was removed from the rat nNOS reductase domain and holoenzyme using site-directed mutagenesis. Three deletion mutants were constructed, the reductase mutants ΔnNOS CaM− (which does not possess the CaM binding region) and ΔnNOS CaM+ (which does possess the CaM binding region), as well as a mutant ΔnNOS holoenzyme. The mutant and native enzymes were used in a comparative study of the effect(s) of deleting this element on the enzyme flavin composition and the Ca2+-dependent CaM activation of nNOS. The results from these mutant enzymes are compared with the wild-type nNOS and the iNOS reductases and holoenzymes. Our findings establish that the 43-amino acid element of nNOS affects but does not completely abolish the Ca2+ dependence of the CaM activation of nNOS. The expression plasmids for the human iNOS and rat nNOS CaM+ reductases coexpressed with CaM and the plasmids for the human iNOS and rat nNOS CaM− reductases were identical to those described previously (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Expression plasmids containing the rat nNOS holoenzyme and the mouse iNOS holoenzyme were generously provided by Dr. B. S. S. Masters (20.Roman L.S. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Proc.

The resulting expression vectors were labeled pCRNNRD, pRNNRD, and nNOSDpCW, respectively. All polymerase chain reaction experiments were performed using PWO polymerase and the buffers supplied by the manufacturer (Roche). The coding sequence of each plasmid carrying a mutant gene was fully sequenced at the MOBIX facility at McMaster University to ensure that no spontaneous mutations had resulted from the polymerase chain reaction. The NOS reductases and nNOS and iNOS holoenzymes were expressed and purified as described previously (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20.Roman L.S. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). A modification of the method was required for the expression of the ΔnNOS holoenzyme because cotransfection of the nNOSDpCW vector with the pGroESL vector expressing groEL and groES did not result in any appreciable yield of protein. The ΔnNOS plasmid was cotransfected with the vector pACMIP, which contained the rat CaM cDNA, into Escherichia coli B21 cells. Expression of the protein was performed as described previously (20.Roman L.S. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8428-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In the purification of ΔnNOS, all of the buffers and procedures used were the same as for the nNOS holoenzyme except that the resuspension buffer also contained 0.3 mm Ca2+. To remove the bound CaM, the wash buffer for the 2′,5′-ADP column contained 1 mm EDTA. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blots were performed using 25-pmol samples of purified protein, as described previously (Fig. 2) (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Western blots were detected using a polyclonal anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:10,000 (Sigma) and the alkaline phosphatase detection system (Sigma). Visible spectroscopy was performed on a Cary 1 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. The ΔnNOS CaM+ and CaM− mutant reductases each exhibited typical maxima at 390 nm and 455 nm (Fig.3) and were quantified using a colorimetric protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad) in addition to the extinction coefficient of 15.4 mm−1cm−1 (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For the holoenzymes, formation of the hemoprotein ferrous-CO adduct, with a Soret band at 445 nm, was used to quantitate the hemoproteins. Samples were bubbled with CO for 5–10 s and divided between the sample and the reference cuvettes. The absorbance difference was adjusted to zero, and the contents of the sample cuvette were reduced by the addition of a few grains of dithionite. The difference spectrum was recorded from 500 nm to 400 nm, and the concentration of the target hemoprotein was estimated using the extinction coefficient of 75 mm−1 (A444–A470) (13.McMillan K. Masters B.S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3686-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Measurements were performed in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 25 °C. Enzymes were also quantified using a colorimetric protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad). Quantitation of FAD and FMN released from nNOS CaM− reductase domain by guanidine hydrochloride treatment was performed as described previously (23.Munro A.W. Lindsay J.G. Coggins J.R. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The nNOS CaM− reductase domain (53 μm) was incubated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in the presence of various concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride at 4 °C for 1 h before scans were taken. Ultrafiltration for 15 min was performed at 4 °C using a Centrisart C4 concentrator (Sartorius), and flavins released from the enzyme after the guanidine hydrochloride incubation were monitored using the fluorescence assay described below. Ferricyanide (FeCN) and dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) assays on the NOS reductase enzymes were performed on a Cary 1 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 units each of superoxide dismutase and catalase, 0.1 mm DCPIP or 1 mm FeCN (extinction coefficients of 20.6 mm−1 cm−1 at 600 nm and 1.02 mm−1 cm−1 at 420 nm, respectively), and 0.2 mm (final concentration) of NADPH (9.Gachhui R. Presta A. Bentley D.F. Abu-Soud H.M. McArthur R. Brudvig G. Ghosh D.K. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20594-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by the addition of a 31.5 nmconcentration of the appropriate reductase enzyme. Electron transfer catalyzed by the NOS reductase domains was monitored as NADPH-dependent cytochrome c reduction as described previously (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Assays were performed on a Varian-Cary Bio 1 spectrophotometer by recording the increase in absorbance changes at 550 nm with time using an extinction coefficient of 21 mm−1 cm−1 for cytochromec (24.Massey V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 34: 255-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The concentration of cytochrome c was varied between 10 and 150 μm. Reaction mixtures with a total volume of 750 μl contained 20 units each of superoxide dismutase and catalase to remove any superoxide that may have been produced by the NOS flavoproteins or free flavins. The FMN dependence of the mutant nNOS reductases was determined by preincubation of the enzymes in 25–1000 μm FMN for 30 min at 4 °C before diluting the flavin content by 150-fold in the reaction mixture. The dependence of these enzymes on FAD and riboflavin was determined in a similar manner. The initial rate of NADPH oxidation by NOS was determined spectroscopically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm with time (extinction coefficient of 6.22 mm−1cm−1) at 37 °C (25.Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley and Sons, Toronto1996: 177-186Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mml-arginine, 4 μm FAD and FMN, 10 units/ml catalase, 0.1 mm NADPH, 4 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 1 μm CaM, and 100 μmCaCl2 in a final volume of 1 ml. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 150 nm enzyme. NO synthesis was measured by both the formation ofl-[3H]citrulline froml-[3H]arginine (25.Stuehr D.J. Griffith O.W. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley and Sons, Toronto1996: 177-186Google Scholar) and the hemoglobin capture assay (26.Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). For the l-[3H]citrulline assay, reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μml-[3H]arginine (0.045 μCi), 10 μg/ml CaM, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1.0 mm NADPH in a final volume of 50 μl. Reactions were started by the addition of 1.5 μg of enzyme. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 2 min and then stopped by the addition of 200 μl of stopping buffer (5 mm EGTA and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 5.5). The activities of the NOS holoenzymes were measured using the hemoglobin assay (extinction coefficient of 60 mm−1 cm−1 at 401 nm) as described previously (26.Hevel J.M. Marletta M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 20 units each of superoxide dismutase and catalase, 8 μm oxyhemoglobin, 1 mm arginine, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 μm CaM, 6 μm tetrahydrobiopterin, and 0.2 mm (final concentration) of NADPH in a total volume of 1 ml. Assays were initiated by the addition of 150 nm nNOS, ΔnNOS, or iNOS holoenzyme. The samples were equilibrated at 25 °C in Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.5 saturated with CO as described previously (27.Martasek P. Miller R.T. Liu Q. Roman L.J. Salerno J.C. Migita C.T. Raman C.S.

The spectra were obtained using sealed cuvettes containing 0.5 μm enzyme, 0.5 μm CaM, 400 μm CaCl2, 100 μml-arginine, and 5 μm BH4. Analysis was initiated by the addition of concentrated NADPH to a final concentration of 200 μm. The FAD and FMN contents of the reductases and holoenzymes were determined using a fluorescence method developed by Faeder and Siegel (28.Faeder E.J. Siegel L.M. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Pure FAD and FMN (greater than 95% pure) were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence measurements were performed in triplicate on a 4800S SLM spectrofluorometer with SMC 210 monochromator control at 27 °C using an excitation slit width of 8 nm and an emission slit width of 16 nm. Activity assays for the reductase enzymes and the holoenzymes were performed in triplicate and as described above except that all cofactor solutions and buffers were treated with Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad) before use. The recombinant bovine brain CaM used in our experiments was a generous gift from Dr. Merentes. The CaM used was depleted of bound Ca2+ by adjusting the pH to 2.0, desalting in 10 mm HCl on a PD10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by adjusting the pH to 7.5 with 0.5 m Tris-HCl (21.Xia Y. Roman L.T. Masters B.S.S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22635-22639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). KCl was added to 100 mm concentration, and the sample was concentrated by a Centriprep 10 concentrator (Amicon). The CaM concentration was determined spectroscopically at 277 nm using an extinction coefficient of 3029 m−1cm−1 (29.Strasburg G.M. Hogan M. Birmarchu W. Thomas D.D. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 542-548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by a colorimetric protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad). Assay buffers with exact Ca2+-free concentrations were prepared as described previously (30.Tsien R. Pozzan T.

The E1 (WRRKRK), N1 (SRKSSG), and N2 (RKSYKVRF) peptides (Fig. 1) were prepared by the peptide synthesis facility at the University of Waterloo. Purity, evaluated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray mass spectrometry, exceeded 90% in all cases. Peptide concentrations of 100 μm were used in all NOS activity assays under standard conditions unless stated otherwise. Peptide studies were performed in the presence of up to 100 μg/ml of peptide as indicated. When the CaM−free enzymes were assayed, the assays were supplemented with 12.5 pmol of CaM and 0.3 mm CaCl2. All assays were initiated by the addition of either 25 pmol of the nNOS reductase enzymes, 30 pmol of iNOS reductase enzymes, or 150 nm NOS holoenzymes. An explanation has yet to be found for the inherent differences in Ca2+-dependent CaM activation of the NOS isoforms. It has long been known that the constitutively expressed neuronal and endothelial NOS enzymes, collectively referred to as cNOS isoforms, contain an additional loop of 40–55 amino acids in the reductase domain which is absent in the iNOS enzyme (2.Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these additional amino acids may act as a CaM autoinhibitory domain. The removal of a typical CaM autoinhibitory domain would be expected to decrease significantly the Ca2+-dependent CaM activation of the enzyme (17.James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). We decided to investigate the function of the 43-amino acid insert in both the reductase domain and holoenzyme of nNOS because both enzymes show Ca2+-dependent CaM activation. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to remove a 43-amino acid loop found within the FMN binding domain of the nNOS isoform which is not found within the FMN binding domain of the iNOS enzyme (Fig. 1). Removal of this element from the nNOS reductase domains and holoenzyme created the ΔnNOS CaM+ (possessing the CaM binding region) and the ΔnNOS CaM− (without the CaM binding region) reductase domains as well as the ΔnNOS holoenzyme. Fig. 2 A shows the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the mutant and wild-type reductase domains. Using this method of analysis the final purity of the proteins was judged to be greater than 90%. Calmodulin was found to copurify with the enzymes when the gene was coexpressed using a polycistronic plasmid. An immunoblot of the wild-type and mutant reductase domains shows the decrease in the size of the mutants caused by the deletion of the loop (Fig. 2 B). The ΔnNOS holoenzyme showed the same reduction in size compared with the wild-type nNOS holoenzyme (data not shown). The 43-amino acid element appears to have a stabilizing effect on the CaM binding region of the rat nNOS reductase domains. Although both the nNOS CaM+ and ΔnNOS CaM− reductase enzymes can be expressed and purified without CaM coexpression, we were not able to purify the ΔnNOS CaM+ protein in the absence of coexpression with CaM because of extensive protein degradation (results not shown). A similar degradation problem was found for the CaM binding domain in the human iNOS CaM+ reductase in the absence of CaM coexpression (7.Newton D.C. Montgomery H.J. Guillemette J.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 359: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although good quantities of pure enzyme were obtained for the wild-type nNOS holoenzyme, when coexpressed with the chaperonens groEL and groES, under similar conditions, we were again unable to isolate the ΔnNOS holoenzyme because of significant protein degradation. To obtain purified ΔnNOS holoenzyme for our investigation, the enzyme also had to be coexpressed with CaM. This suggests a protein stabilizing role for the 43-amino acid element which may protect the nNOS CaM binding region from proteases as proposed previously by Salerno et al. (15.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.H. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

The native and mutant oxidized reductase domains gave typical flavoprotein visible spectra with peak maxima at 390 nm and 455 nm (Fig. 3). A further investigation of these flavoproteins was performed by recording their spectra after partial reduction by NADPH under aerobic conditions. The partial reduction of the wild-type nNOS CaM+ reductase enzyme produced a spectrum characteristic of the air-stable semiquinone (FAD/FMNH⋅) with a decrease in absorbance at 455 nm and a broad band at 600 nm (Fig.3 A), as shown for NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (31.Shen A.L. Sem D.S. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5391-5398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32.Masters B.S. Bilimoria M.H. Kamin H. Gibson Q.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic broad band at 600 nm is apparent in both the wild-type nNOS CaM+ and nNOS CaM− reductases and only slightly reduced in size in the ΔnNOS CaM− reductase spectrum. In contrast, the broad band at 600 nm for the ΔnNOS CaM+ mutant is greatly reduced in size (Fig. 3 B). Because the air-stable semiquinone is known to be FMNH⋅, these results suggest that the ΔnNOS CaM+ reductase is significantly depleted of FMN compared with the wild-type enzyme. This is consistent with a reported sequence alignment of the NOS isoforms, flavodoxin, and cytochrome P450 reductases (15.Salerno J.C. Harris D.E. Irizarry K. Patel B. Morales A.H. Smith S.M.E. Martasek P. Roman L.J. Masters B.S.S. Jones C.L. Weissman B.A. Lane P. Liu Q. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29769-29777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), which suggests that the aforementioned 43-amino acid insert, only found in the constitutive NOS enzymes, is located within the FMN binding domain (Fig. 1). The nNOS and iNOS holoenzymes gave characteristic cytochrome P450-like CO difference spectra with a peak at 444 nm. The visible spectra of these enzymes showed a peak maximum at 395 nm and a minimum at 420 nm (results not shown) (20.Roman L.S. Sheta E.A. Martasek P. Gross S.S. Liu Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. 1973; 53: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) was used to determine the FAD and FMN content in the NOS reductase enzymes and holoenzymes. Both the wild-type rat nNOS CaM+ and human iNOS CaM+ reductases had full complements of FAD and ratios of protein to FMN of 1:0.8. The rat ΔnNOS CaM+ reductase had a protein to FAD ratio of 1:1 and, as expected from our spectral studies, a protein to FMN ratio of 1:0.2. The wild-type rat nNOS CaM−, human iNOS CaM−, and rat ΔnNOS CaM− reductase enzymes showed a smaller decrease in flavin content, with protein to FAD and protein to FMN ratios of 1:0.8 and 1:0.6,"

Here, we report the first cloning of cDNAs that encode the bovine and porcine GLTPs. The cDNA open reading frame for bovine GLTP was constructed by bridge-overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) after obtaining partial coding cDNA clones by hot start, seminested, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR. The cDNA open reading frame for porcine GLTP was constructed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The encoded amino acid sequences in the full-length bovine and porcine cDNAs were identical, consisting of 209 amino acid residues, and were nearly the same as the published sequence determined by Edman degradation. The cDNA encoded one additional amino acid at the N terminus (methionine), arginine at positions 10 and 200 instead of lysine, and threonine at position 65 instead of alanine. Expression of GLTP-cDNA in Escherichia coli using pGEX-6P-1 vector resulted in glutathione S-transferase (GST)-GLTP fusion protein. Regulation of growth and induction conditions led to ∼50% of expressed fusion protein being soluble and active. Proteolytic cleavage of GST-GLTP fusion protein (bound to GST-Sepharose) and affinity purification resulted in fully active GLTP. Northern blot analyses of bovine tissues showed a single transcript of ∼2.2 kilobases and the following hierarchy of mRNA levels: cerebrum > kidney > spleen ≅ lung ≅ cerebellum > liver > heart muscle. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analyses of mRNA levels supported the Northern blot results."

Previous studies identified two substrates of the TCR-induced protein-tyrosine kinases, SH2 domain-containingleukocyte specific protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) and SLP-76-associatedphosphoprotein of 130 kDa (SLAP-130). While SLP-76 appears to couple the TCR with downstream signals, SLAP-130 may play a negative regulatory role in T cell activation. In this study, we demonstrate that consistent with its ability to abrogate the SLP-76 augmentation of TCR-induced activation of the NFAT/AP1 region of the interleukin-2 promoter, overexpression of SLAP-130 also interferes with the rescue of signaling in SLP-76-deficient Jurkat cells in co-transfection experiments. The effect of SLAP-130 on SLP-76 function is specific for regulating TCR-induced ERK activation, but not phospholipase Cγ 1 phosphorylation. By generating both deletion and point mutants of SLAP-130, we identified tyrosine 559 as critical for the interaction between SLP-76 and SLAP-130. We show that mutation of this residue in context of full-length SLAP-130 diminishes the ability of SLAP-130 to abrogate SLP-76 function.

One experimental strategy to understand better the coordinate regulation of these diverse signaling events is to identify and characterize substrates of the TCR-activated protein-tyrosine kinases. In addition to effector molecules, recent work has shown that adapter proteins such as Cbl (25.Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.Y. Samelson L.E. J. Biol.

In an attempt to determine how these adapter molecules regulate the signaling events involved in T cell activation, studies have been designed to identify molecules which associate with these proteins and to determine the functional significance of these interactions. Recently, we and others have shown that the SLP-76associated phosphoprotein of 130kDa (30.Musci M. Hendricks-Taylor L. Motto D. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C. Koretzky G. J. Biol.

Analysis of the primary sequence of SLAP-130 reveals no probable enzymatic function; however, it contains several domains that may mediate associations with other proteins. SLAP-130 contains 16 possible tyrosine phosphorylation sites, a central proline-rich region which has recently been identified as the SKAP-55 (another adapter molecule (32.Marie-Cardine A. Bruyns E.

De Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Although SLAP-130 inducibly binds to SLP-76, we were surprised to find that in our model system unlike SLP-76, overexpression of SLAP-130 does not augment TCR-induced activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)/AP1 region of the IL-2 promoter in Jurkat T cells (30.Musci M.

More striking was our observation that co-overexpression of SLAP-130 and SLP-76 abrogates the ability of SLP-76 to augment this TCR-induced activation event suggesting that SLAP-130 may serve as a negative regulator of TCR mediated signaling. It should be noted, however, that controversy remains regarding the role of SLAP-130/FYB in the regulation of TCR signaling as others have shown (31.da Silva A.J. Li Z. De Vera C. Canto E. Findell P. Rudd C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7493-7498Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34.Raab M. Kang H. da Silva A. Zhu X. Rudd C.E. J. Biol.

In a series of experiments designed to investigate further the role of SLAP-130 in the regulation of SLP-76 function in T cell signaling, we found that in our model system overexpression of SLAP-130 along with SLP-76 inhibits SLP-76 mediated augmentation of the entire IL-2 promoter, as well as the NFAT/AP1 region, following TCR ligation. Consistent with this observation, we show that co-transfection of SLAP-130 along with SLP-76 inhibits the ability of SLP-76 to rescue TCR-induced signaling in a SLP-76-deficient Jurkat variant. Next, we asked whether the SLAP-130/SLP-76 association is important for the effect of SLAP-130 on SLP-76 function by determining the region of SLAP-130 which is important for association with SLP-76 in activated T cells. In these experiments, we identified a tyrosine residue that serves as a phosphorylation site responsible for promoting the binding of SLAP-130 to the SLP-76 SH2 domain in Jurkat T cells. We found that the binding of SLAP-130 to SLP-76 is important for the inhibitory effect of SLAP-130 on the regulation of NFAT/AP1 promoter activity following TCR engagement. E6–1 Jurkat T cells (35.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) were maintained in RPMI 1640 media with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (1000 units/ml), streptomycin (1000 units/ml), and glutamine (20 mm) in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C as described previously (30.Musci M.

A mutant variant of Jurkat deficient in SLP-76 expression, J14-v-29, was kindly provided by Dr. A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA) (36.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The cDNA for SLAP-130 was cloned as described previously (30.Musci M. Hendricks-Taylor L. Motto D. Paskind M. Kamens J. Turck C. Koretzky G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11674-11677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Briefly, the amino-terminal 1350 nucleotides of SLAP-130 were amplified from Jurkat RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using the GeneAmp kit (Perkin-Elmer), and were subcloned into pEF/Flag at theBamHI and XbaI sites in-frame with the Flag epitope to generate pEF/Flag/SLAP-130/1–460. The remaining 1000 base pairs were amplified from Jurkat RNA by overlap extension reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The resulting fragment was ligated in-frame with the amino-terminal 1350 base pairs (pEF/Flag/SLAP-130/1–460) described above to create pEF/Flag/SLAP-130 or ligated into pEF/Flag at the XbaI site to generate pEF/Flag/SLAP-130/460–783. The pEF/HA/SLAP-130 truncation mutants were prepared by generating a series of polymerase chain reaction products using primers corresponding to the designated amino acids. Using a 5′ sense primer (TCGGATCCGCGGCCCCTCTAGAT) for each of the three truncation mutants, we used the antisense primers TCGGGTACCGGTATGACTTGAATAGGGCCTG for pEF/SLAP-130/460–525, GGATCCGCGGCCGCAGACTCTCTTGGTGC for pEF/SLAP-130/460–595, and TCGGTACCTGGTTTGTATAACTTCTAGAGA for pEF/SLAP-130/460–750, respectively. The pEF/Flag/SLAP-130 point mutations were generated by overlap extension of pEF/Flag/SLAP/460–783 and were initially cloned into pEF/HA at the XbaI site. Using the same sense primer used for the truncation mutants in combination with primers derived from the SLP-76-binding domain and corresponding to a single base pair change of tyrosine (TAT) to phenylalanine (TTT) and an antisense primer for the 3′ coding region (TCTAGAGGTACCGACTAGTCATTGTCATA), we generated the tyrosine point mutations. Both sense and antisense primers were designed corresponding to each point mutation (GGGGTTCATTTGGCTATATTAAAAC for pEF/SLAP-130/Y559F, GGGGTTCATATGGCTTTATTAAAAC for pEF/SLAP-130/Y559F, and GATTGACTTTGATTCTTTG for pEF/SLAP-130/Y559F). For generation of the full-length SLAP-130 point mutants, the constructs containing the mutation were subcloned in-frame with pEF/Flag/SLAP-130/1–460 at the XbaI site. All constructs generated using polymerase chain reaction were sequenced and the fidelity confirmed at the University of Iowa DNA Sequencing Core (Iowa City, IA). The GST-SLP-76 SH2 domain prokaryotic expression vector (pGEX/SLP-SH2) was generated as described previously (37.Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). pEF/Flag/SLP-76 and pEF/HA/SLP-76 were cloned into the pEF vector at the BamHI and XbaI sites as described previously (38.Motto D.G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pEF/HLA-A2, the expression vector containing the HLA-A2 cDNA, was a gift of B. Shraven (University of Heidelberg, Germany). pIL-2 luciferase and pIL-2 NFAT/AP1-luciferase were gifts from G. Crabtree (Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA). pCMV/β-galactosidase was a gift from G. MacGregor (Atlanta, GA). The Myc epitope-tagged plasmid (pEF/Myc/ERK) was a gift from A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The following antibodies were used: clonotypic Jurkat anti-TCR mAb C305 (35.Weiss A. Stobo J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1284-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) (gift from A. Weiss, University of California, San Francisco, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, 4G10 (gift from B. Druker, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR); anti-FLAG mAb M2 (International Biotechnologies Inc., New Haven, CT); anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Corp., Indianapolis, IN); anti-ERK 1&2 polyclonal antibody, anti-PLCγ 1 mixed monoclonal antibody, and anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY); and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in cytomix (120 mmKCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, pH adjusted with KOH) (39.van den Hoff M.J. Moorman A.F. Lamers W.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 1.5 × 107 cells/400 μl of cytomix/cuvette. Cells were electroporated at 250 V, 960 microfarads using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) with 25 μg of pIL-2 or pIL2-NFAT/AP1-luciferase, 5 μg of pCMV/β-galactosidase, and 40 μg of the SLAP-130 and SLP-76 expression vectors. The total amount of plasmid DNA was equilibrated to 100 μg with the vector control pEF/HLA-A2. After 24 h, 5 × 105 cells were stimulated in triplicate for 16 h with media, immobilized anti-TCR mAb C305 (ascites 1:1000), or 50 ng/ml phorbol ester (PMA) plus 1 μm ionomycin (maximum response). Additionally, triplicate samples of 5 × 10 5 unstimulated cells were assayed for β-galactosidase activity using the Galacto-Light Plus Reporter Gene Assay System (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). Luciferase activity was determined as described previously (37.Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Luciferase light units were normalized to β-galactosidase activity present in each transfectant to standardize for transfection efficiency. The luciferase activity is expressed as percentage of the maximal promoter activity which is induced by incubation of the transfected cells with PMA and ionomycin. Following transformation of DH5′α with pGEX/SLP-SH2, recombinant protein was purified from logarithmically growing cells (A 500 = 0.6) that had been incubated for 2 h at 25 °C with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Life Technologies, Inc., Grand Island, NY). The bacterial pellet was resuspended in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 100 mmNaCl) and sonicated (Branson Sonifier 250; Bio-Rad) at 50% power and 20 duty cycles. Following incubation of the lysates with 1% Triton X-100 and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C for 10 min, the cell lysates were cleared at 10,000 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. The GST fusion protein was bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and the complex was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Transfected Jurkat T cells were left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-TCR mAb (C305 ascites, 1:1000) for 5 min and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl) including protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 50 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and protein phosphatase inhibitors (400 μm sodium vanadate, 10 mmsodium fluoride, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). Lysates were subjected to precipitation with the GST/SLP-76 SH2 domain agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitated complexes were washed 3 times in high salt lysis buffer (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl), resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gels for separation of full-length SLAP-130 and SLP-76, SDS 15% for separation of the SLAP-130 truncation mutants). Following transfer to 0.22-μm nitrocellulose, the blots were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween 20 (100 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20, and 0.02% NaN3). Each blot was probed with 2 μg/ml of either anti-HA or anti-Flag antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS/Tween 20. The immunoreactive proteins were detected following incubation with a 1:15,000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in TBS using enhanced chemiluminecence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfected cells (2 × 106 cells/sample) were left unstimulated or stimulated with C305 for 5 min and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer including protease inhibitors and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors (33.Marie-Cardine A. Verhagen A.M. Eckerskorn C. Schraven B. FEBS Lett. 1998; 435: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In experiments involving the detection of phosphorylated PLCγ1, cells stimulated with pervanadate were used to assess TCR-independent phosphorylation as a positive control (16.Secrist J.P. Burns L.A. Karnitz L. Koretzky G.A. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5886-5893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitations, antibodies (2 μg/immunoprecipitation) were conjugated to GammaBind Plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at 4 °C. Lysates were subjected to precipitation with the indicated antibody-conjugated Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed 3 times with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 500 mm NaCl, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% polyacrylamide gels for separation of full-length SLAP-130 and SLP-76, 15% for separation of the SLAP-130 truncation mutants, and 8% for detection of PLCγ1), and transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis as described previously. Cells were transfected as described previously (40.Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar) with pEF/Flag/SLAP-130 and/or pEF/Flag/SLP-76. Transfected cells were left unstimulated or were stimulated for 5 min with either C305 or PMA (50 ng/ml), then lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5 mm EGTA). Lysates from 2 × 106 cell equivalents were subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE (12%) for visualization of ERK by immunoblot analysis using an anti-ERK 1 and 2 antibody. In parallel, lysates from 2 × 106 cell equivalents were subjected to anti-Myc immunoprecipitation. The immune complexes were washed twice with Triton lysis buffer with 0.1% Triton X-100, twice with TBS, and once with kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 130 mmMgCl, 1.5 mm EGTA). Samples were suspended in kinase assay buffer with myelin basic protein (1 μg/ml, Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (0.22 μCi/sample), incubated for 15 min at room temperature, then subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gels). Phosphorylated myelin basic protein was detected by autoradiography, quantitated by scanning densitometry, and normalized to maximal phosphorylation in PMA-treated samples. Jurkat cells transfected with pEF/Flag/SLAP-130 were stimulated with C305 for 5 min and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer including protease inhibitors and protein-tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. The GST/SLP-76 SH2 domain agarose beads were preincubated with vehicle or 50 μm of each peptide (see Fig. 6 A, for peptide sequences) for 30 min at 4 °C. Lysates were then subjected to precipitation with the GST/SLP-76 SH2 domain agarose beads in the presence of peptides for 2 h at 4 °C. Precipitated complexes were washed 3 times in high salt lysis buffer and resolved by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis to detect Flag-tagged SLAP-130. Stimulation of the TCR on Jurkat T-cells results in the transactivation of theIL-2 gene which can be measured using a transfectable luciferase reporter construct encoding the full-length IL-2 promoter or multiple copies of the NFAT/AP1 region of this promoter (41.Durand D.B. Bush M.R. Morgan J. Weiss A. Crabtree G.R. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 42.Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Crabtree G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). We and others have shown that overexpression of SLP-76 augments IL-2 promoter function in response to TCR ligation (43.Fang N. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3769-3773PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol.

Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Since the SLP-76 SH2 domain is required for augmentation of TCR signaling by SLP-76 (37.Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Wu J. Hendricks-Taylor L.R. Koretzky G.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 40.Musci M.A. Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Fang N. Koretzky G.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that SLAP-130, which was initially isolated as a SLP-76 SH2 domain-binding protein, would also serve as a positive regulator of TCR signals. Surprisingly, we found that overexpression of SLAP-130 blocks the augmentation of TCR-induced NFAT/AP1 activity by overexpressed SLP-76 30) (Fig.1 A, left panel). As shown, SLAP-130 overexpression does not change TCR-stimulated NFAT/AP1 promoter activity compared with cells transfected with an unrelated cDNA (HLA-A2), while overexpression of SLP-76 dramatically augments NFAT/AP1 function. Expression of the Flag epitope-tagged SLAP-130 and SLP-76 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of whole cell lysates (Fig.1 A, right panel). To extend this finding to activity of the entire IL-2 promoter, we co-transfected Jurkat T cells with a full-length IL-2 promoter construct driving the luciferase gene along with expression vectors that encode for SLAP-130, SLP-76, or both. Fig. 1 B(left panel) shows that again, in contrast to overexpression of SLP-76 alone, overexpressed SLAP-130 has little effect on TCR-induced IL-2 promoter function although equivalent levels of SLAP-130 and SLP-76 were expressed in the transfected cells (Fig.1 B, right panel). However, when overexpressed along with SLP-76, SLAP-130 inhibits the augmentation of TCR-inducible promoter activity by SLP-76. We extended these observations by studying the effect of transfecting SLAP-130 into J14-v-29, a SLP-76 deficient variant of Jurkat. As previously shown by others (36.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) and demonstrated in Fig.2, TCR stimulation fails to activate the NFAT/AP1 promoter in this mutant. Reconstitution of SLP-76 expression rescues this signaling defect (left panel). Consistent with the experiment shown in Fig. 1, co-transfection of SLAP-130 along with SLP-76 blocks reconstitution of TCR-induced NFAT/AP1 promoter activity. To determine where in the TCR-regulated signaling cascade SLAP-130 interferes with SLP-76 function, we examined the effect of co-transfection of SLAP-130 and SLP-76 on TCR-induced second messenger activation. First, J14-v-29 cells were transfected with a control plasmid (HLA-A2), SLAP-130, SLP-76, or the combination of SLAP-130 plus SLP-76. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated via the TCR or with pervanadate, then lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody directed against PLCγ1. As shown in Fig.3 A, engagement of the TCR on J14-v-29 fails to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1, although this event is seen following pervanadate treatment. This signaling defect is rescued when cells are transfected with SLP-76. Co-transfection of SLAP-130 along with SLP-76 does not interfere with this readout of TCR ligation. In contrast, when TCR-stimulated activation of ERK is studied, co-transfection of SLAP-130 with SLP-76 blocks rescue of J14-v-29. This is shown in Fig. 3, B-D. For the experiment depicted in Fig.3 B, J14-v-29 cells transfected with SLP-76, SLAP-130, or the combination of SLP-76 plus SLAP-130 were left unstimulated or treated with anti-TCR or PMA. Lysates were then prepared and analyzed for ERK activation by a gel shift assay. As shown, transfection of SLP-76, but not SLAP-130 results in TCR-induced ERK activation. Co-transfection of SLP-76 plus SLAP-130 prevents TCR-stimulated ERK function, but has no effect on the ability of ERK to be activated following PMA treatment. These findings are corroborated in the experiment shown in Fig. 3,C and D. In this study, J14-v-29 cells were transfected with Myc-ERK along with control plasmid, SLP-76, SLAP-130, or the combination of SLP-76 plus SLAP-130. Cells were left unstimulated or stimulated via the TCR or with PMA. Lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc. Kinase assays using myelin basic protein as a"

We show here that this site in R-Ras is capable of binding SH3 domains and that the SH3 domain binding may be important for R-Ras function. A fusion protein containing the SH3 domains of the adaptor protein Nck interacted strongly with the R-Ras proline-rich sequence and with the intact protein. The binding was independent of whether R-Ras was in its GDP or GTP form. The Nck binding, which was mediated by the second of the three SH3 domains of Nck, was obliterated by mutations in the proline-rich sequence of R-Ras. The interaction of Nck with R-Ras could also be shown in yeast two-hybrid assays and by co-immunoprecipitation in human cells transfected with Nck and R-Ras. Previous results have shown that the expression of a constitutively active R-Ras mutant, R-Ras(38V), converts mouse 32D monocytic cells into highly adherent cells. Introducing the proline mutations into R-Ras(38V) suppressed the effect of R-Ras on 32D cell adhesion while not affecting GTP binding. These results reveal an unexpected regulatory pathway that controls R-Ras through an SH3 domain interaction. This pathway appears to be important for the ability of R-Ras to control cell adhesion.

Their activity also helps regulate cell survival, growth, differentiation, and migration. Integrin activity is, in turn, regulated by the cell. The most striking examples of regulated integrin activity are the activation of the platelet αIIbβ3 integrin in blood clotting and the activation of the leukocyte β2 integrins in inflammation (1.Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 2.Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6400) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms of integrin regulation are not well understood. There appear to be two ways of enhancing the cell attachment-promoting activity of integrins; clustering of integrins at the cell surface can enhance the avidity of integrins in cell attachment, whereas conformational changes can increase the affinity of individual integrin molecules (3.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar, 4.Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Med. 1997; 186: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal connections of integrins are likely to be important in the avidity regulation (7.Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of integrins may be regulated by other types of proteins. Cytohesins are phosphatidylinositol-binding proteins, at least one of which binds to the cytoplasmic tail of the β2 integrin subunit and can up-regulate the activity of β2 integrins in leukocytic cells (8.Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Endonexin is a β3-binding protein that increases the activity of the αIIbβ3 integrin when overexpressed in cells (9.Kashiwagi H. Schwartz M.A. Eigenthaler M. Davis K.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1433-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). ILK is a protein kinase capable of interacting with β1, β2, and β3 integrin subunit cytoplasmic tails; it can reduce the activity of integrins containing these subunits (10.Dedhar S. Hannigan G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 657-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II also down-regulates integrin activity (11.Bouvard D. Molla A. Block M.R. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 657-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Certain oncoproteins can change integrin activity, generally by lowering it. Thus, c-Src phosphorylates a tyrosine residue in the β1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, and this phosphorylation reduces the ligand binding activity of β1 integrins and changes their subcellular localization (12.Hirst R. Horwitz A. Buck C. Rohrschneider L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6470-6474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 13.Johansson M. Larsson E Lüning B. Pasquale E.B. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1299-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The small GTPases of the Ras and Rho families are intimately involved in integrin and cytoskeletal regulation. The activation of Rho induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, with consequent cell spreading and effects on integrins (14.Hotchin N.A. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 15.Machesky L.M. Hall A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The related proteins Rac and Cdc42 alter the cytoskeleton differently than Rho, inducing membrane ruffling and microspike formation, respectively. The oncogenic p21 ras (Ras) reduces integrin activity (16.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). R-Ras, a small GTPase with a poorly understood function, regulates integrin activity (17.Zhang Z. Vuori K.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Unlike Ras, R-Ras promotes integrin activity and converts cells that normally grow in suspension into highly adhesive cells (17.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Moreover, a dominant negative R-Ras (R-Ras(43N)), when transfected into adherent cells, causes the cells to round up, suggesting that R-Ras is necessary for the maintenance of integrin activity (17.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Unlike dominant negative mutants of the oncogenic Ras proteins, R-Ras(43N) is not growth inhibitory (20.Huff S.Y. Quilliam L.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, R-Ras may be primarily a regulator of cell adhesion, and it is important to understand how this regulation functions. Examining R-Ras for sequence features that might be responsible for its integrin activating function, we noticed that R-Ras differs from Ras and most other members of Ras superfamily small GTPases in that it possesses a distinct proline-rich site. We show here that this site can bind SH3 domains and that the adaptor protein Nck is one of the SH3 domain proteins that interact with R-Ras in cells. We also show that the SH3-binding site is required for integrin activating function of R-Ras. These results reveal an unexpected regulatory interaction for R-Ras that appears to be important for the ability of R-Ras to control cell adhesion. This interaction represents a novel form of cross-talk between a small GTPase and other cellular signaling pathways. Mouse monocytic cell line 32D.3 was maintained essentially as described (17.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E.

Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. Polyclonal rabbit antibody against the N-terminal 26-amino acid peptide of R-Ras was a gift from Dr. John Reed (21.Wang H.G. Millan J.A. Cox A.D. Der C.J. Rapp U.R. Beck T. Zha H. Reed J.C. J.

Mouse hybridoma cell line producing monoclonal antibody 9E10 against Myc epitope was obtained from American Type Cell Culture. Polyclonal anti-Nck antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human plasma fibronectin was from the Finnish Red Cross. To create the maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion plasmid pMBP-RRC, two oligonucleotides spanning the coding sequence for amino acids 191–212 (RKYQEQELPPSPPSAPRKKGGG) of R-Ras were synthesized with XbaI and EcoRI overhangs (sense strand: 5′-ATTCAGGAAATACCAGGAACAAGAGCTCCCACCGAGCCCTCCCAGTGCCCCCAGGAAGAAGGCCGGGGGCTAGT-3′ (underlined letters indicate codons for prolines 202 and 203); antisense strand: 5′-CTAGACTAGCCCCCGCCCTTCTTCCTGGGGGCACTGGGAGGGCTCGGTGGGAGCTCTTGTTCCTGGTATTTCCTG-3′). The oligonucleotides were annealed, phosphorylated by using polynucleotide kinases, and ligated in frame into the pPR997 maltose fusion protein vector (New England Biolab) digested withXbaI and EcoRI. Mutants were derived by changing the codon for proline to alanine at amino acids 202 (P202A), 203 (P203A), or both 202 and 203 (P202A,P203A). The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain XL-1 blue (Strategene), and MBP fusion proteins were purified according the manufacturer's instructions. To introduce double proline to alanine (P202A,P203A) mutations into the R-Ras mammalian expression vector, R-Ras was first amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a 3′ antisense primer containing P202A,P203A mutations (5′-GCTCTAGACTCGAGCTACAGGAGGACGCAGGGGCAGCCCCCGCCCTTCTTCCTGGGGGCACTGGGAGGGCTGGCGGCGAGCTCTTGTTC-3′, underlining indicates P202A,P203A mutations) and a 5′ primer at the beginning of R-Ras coding sequence (5′-ATGAGCTCTGGTGCT-3′). The polymerase chain reaction product was digested with XbaI andStuI, which cuts near nucleotides coding for amino acid 174 of R-Ras. This fragment was then cloned into pcDNA3-HA-R-Ras(wt) or pcDNA3-HA-R-Ras(38V) to obtain pHRR(wt)-(P202A,P203A) and pHRR(38V)-(P202A,P203A) respectively. The same fragment was also cloned into pcDNA3-Myc-R-Ras (pMRR) to create pMRR-(P202A,P203A). All constructs were verified by dideoxynucletotide sequencing (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). pEBB-Nck was a generous gift from Dr. B. Mayer (22.Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar).

Nck deletion mutants were constructed by removing SH3 domain individually from the C terminus of NcK by polymerase chain reaction (27.Kitamura Y. Kitamura T. Sakaue H. Maeda T. Ueno H. Nishio S. Ohno S. Osada S. Sakaue M. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction fragments were then cloned into PGEX-4T1 and expressed as GST fusion proteins. The plasmid for GST fusion protein of the second SH3 domain was obtained from Dr. Sakaue. Expression vectors for GST-R-Ras and GST-R-Ras-(P202A,P203A) were constructed by digesting the plasmids pcDNA3-Myc-R-Ras and pMRR-(P202A,P203A) with EcoRI and XhoI. The released inserts were then cloned into the vector PGEX4T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All of the fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (28.Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). About 10 μg of MBP alone, MBP-RRC, or its mutants were labeled with Na125I using Iodogen (Pierce) as described previously (29.Wang B. Dickinson L.A. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. Kohwi- Shigematsu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23239-23242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In a typical binding assay, 10 μg of a GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The beads were washed twice with PBS and once with the binding buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 1% BSA, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and resuspended in 20 μl of the same buffer at 4 °C. About 1 × 106 cpm of 125I-labeled MBP-RRC fusion protein in PBS containing 1% BSA was added to each tube and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with binding buffer without BSA. The bound materials were eluted with 50 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer, separated on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE minigel (Novex, San Diego), and exposed to x-ray films. A GST-R-Ras fusion protein containing the entire R-Ras protein was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed with loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA) and split into two tubes. The beads were incubated with 1 mm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP in 200 μl of the loading buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. After the incubation, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm to stabilize the binding, 1 ml of cell lysate from 293 cells expressing HA-Nck (full length) was then added to GST-R-Ras beads loaded with GTPγS or GDP. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, the beads were washed three times with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blotted with anti-HA antibody to visualize HA-Nck. The yeast two-hybrid system was used to study protein-protein interactions essentially as described (30.Morla A. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar,31.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). A cDNA encoding R-Ras without CAAX box (the CAAX box was removed to allow nuclear localization of R-Ras) was amplified with polymerase chain reaction and cloned intoEcoRI and SmaI sites of pBTM116, and the SH3 domains of Nck were cloned into the Klenow-treated BamHI andNotI sites of VP16. As a negative control, lamin cDNA was cloned into BTM116. Yeast strain L40 was co-transfected with 1 μg of each plasmid by the LiCl method (32.Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). One-tenth of the transformed yeast cells were plated onto medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and leucine (UTL) for analysis of transformation efficiency, and nine-tenths were plated onto medium lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, leucine, and lysine (THULL). UTL colonies were grown for 2 days at 30 °C and then restreaked onto UTL and THULL plates. Filters were loaded on the plates with streaks from yeast transformation, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and warmed to room temperature and then stained with 0.4 mg/ml 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside in 60 mm Na2HPO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0, at 30 °C. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells on 100-mm plates were transiently transfected with 10 μg of the indicated vectors using standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. Two days later, cells were lysed in buffer A containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% BSA, and protease inhibitors (0.1 unit/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Antibodies were added to lysates containing equal amount of proteins and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. To precipitate the antibody-antigen complex, Gammabind Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and incubation was continued for another hour. The immunoprecipitates, pelleted by centrifugation, were washed twice with buffer A containing 0.1% BSA, and once with buffer A alone. The beads were boiled in sample buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P nylon membrane (Millipore) and subjected to immunoblotting. Filters were first blocked for 1 h with blocking buffer (3% milk plus 1% BSA in PBS) and incubated with primary antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 1 h. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) were added at 1:5000 dilutions in blocking buffer. Membrane were developed with Enhanced Luminol Reagents from DuPont. Log phase 32D.3 cells were transfected with indicated plasmids by as described (16.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). One day after transfection, 0.7 μg/ml Geneticin (G418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added. Individual clones were obtained by limited dilution. Level of expression in each clone was examined by immunoblot with an anti-HA epitope monoclonal antibody 12CA5. Serial dilutions of fibronectin in PBS was coated on 96-well microtiter plates starting at 10 μg/ml. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS. 32D cells and their transfectants were collected by pipetting or by using brief treatment with 1 mm EDTA in PBS. The suspended cells were washed and plated in duplicate onto fibronectin-coated wells in serum-free medium at 1 × 105 cells/well and allowed to adhere for 1 h at 37 °C. Adherent cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and stained with 0.5% crystal violet, which was then extracted with 50% ethanol in 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 4.5, and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 595 nm. 10 μg of purified GST-R-Ras, GST-R-Ras-(P202A,P203A) or GST were incubated with 10 μCi of [α-32P]GTP in 50 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at room temperature. Glutathione-Sepharose and 500 μl of ice-cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the washing buffer and eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS and 20 mm EDTA) for 5 min at 65 °C. Radioactivity of a 20-μl sample was quantified by scintillation counting. In a search for potential mediators for the integrin activating function of R-Ras, we examined sequence features of R-Ras outside the effector domain. As shown in Fig.1 a proline-rich region toward the C terminus of R-Ras contains three possible PXXP minimal SH3 domain recognition sequences, one of which conforms to the consensus features of a preferred binding site for type II SH3 domains (33.Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 34.Alexandropoulos K. Cheng G. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3110-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). No PXXP motif is present in other members of Ras superfamily small GTPases with the exception of TC21 and CDC42Hs. TC21 is most closely related to R-Ras (35.Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quilliam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and contains a single PPSP motif (Fig.1 B). CDC42Hs belongs to the Rho subfamily of small GTPases (36.Drivas G.T. Shih A. Coutavas E. Rush M.G. D'Eustachio P. Molec. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 1793-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), its PPEPKK site also conforms to the consensus type II SH3-binding motif (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the brain-specific version of CDC42Hs, G25K, (37.Shinjo K. Koland J.G. Hart M.J. Narasimhan V. Johnson D.I. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9853-9857Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) lacks the potential SH3-binding site. To determine whether R-Ras can indeed bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins, we fused the C-terminal portion of R-Ras (amino acids 192–212) to MBP and screened a panel of GST-SH3 domain fusion proteins for binding to this fusion protein, MBP-RRC. A recombinant protein encompassing the three SH3 domains of Nck bound avidly to MBP-RRC (Fig. 2 A). By counting the excised band, it was estimated that about 12% of125I-labeled MBP-RRC could be bound by the Nck SH3 domain fragment. None of the other SH3 domains tested exhibited binding above the background level of GST alone. As a control, MBP alone was tested and did not bind to any SH3 domain fusion proteins under the same conditions (Fig. 2 A, lower panel). These results show that the proline-rich domain of R-Ras can serve as selective binding site for SH3 domain-containing proteins, Nck in particular. To demonstrate that the interaction between the C-terminal portion of R-Ras and Nck is mediated by the proline-rich region, proline to alanine point mutations were introduced to alter the PXXP motifs in R-Ras. Fig. 2 B shows that mutation of proline 202 to alanine (P202A), which eliminates the first PXXP site (Fig. 1 A), greatly reduced the binding to Nck SH3 domains. Disrupting the second and third PXXP sites with the P203A mutation similarly reduced Nck binding. Mutating both prolines (P202A,P203A) resulted in further reduction of the Nck binding. These results show that the proline-rich domain is required for binding to Nck SH3 domains. Testing with fusion proteins containing various combinations of the three Nck SH3 domains showed that only the middle SH3 domain of Nck binds R-Ras (Fig. 2 C). To investigate the role of GTP binding in the R-Ras interaction with Nck, binding of Nck to GTP-bound and GDP-bound R-Ras-GST fusion protein was examined. Nck was found to bind both the GTP and GDP forms of R-Ras, indicating that the Nck interaction is not regulated by the R-Ras nucleotide binding (Fig. 2 D). The interaction between R-Ras and Nck in cells was examined initially in a yeast two-hybrid assay (38.Munemitsu S. Innis M.A. Clark R. McCormick F. Ullrich A. Polakis P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1990; 10: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 39.Soans C. Holash J.A. Pavlova Y. Pasquale E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 781-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A Nck fragment encoding the SH3 domains was the “prey,” and R-Ras with a deleted CAAX box (R-Ras-CAAX −) was the “bait.” R-Ras and Nck interacted strongly in this growth assay (Fig.3) as well as in an assay based on β-galactosidase activity (not shown). As expected (40.Winning R.S. Scales J.B. Sargent T.D. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), R-Ras interacted also with Raf-1 (not shown). A negative control using lamin as bait showed no signal with the Nck prey. Thus, the SH3 domain is active in yeast cells, and R-Ras can associate specifically with Nck in these cells. To study R-Ras-SH3 domain interaction in mammalian cells, we transiently transfected Nck into 293 cells together with HA-tagged R-Ras or R-Ras-(P202A,P203A). Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot shows that wild-type R-Ras co-immunoprecipitated with Nck and that P202A,P203A mutation significantly reduced that association (Fig.4 A, left half). Similar results were obtained when cells were transfected with HA-tagged Nck and Myc-tagged R-Ras or R-Ras-(P202A,P203A) (Fig.4 A right half). These results indicate that R-Ras and Nck can associate in intact cells and that proline-rich domain is necessary for the association. We have previously demonstrated that an activated form of R-Ras, R-Ras(38V), can induce substrate attachment of 32D mouse monocytic cells, which normally grow in suspension, and that the increased adhesiveness is caused by integrin activation (17.Zhang Z. Vuori K. Wang H. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We next used this assay to determine whether the proline-rich site contributes to the integrin-regulating activity of R-Ras. A major proportion of transfected 32D cells expressing the activated R-Ras(38V) became adherent and spread on tissue culture dishes (Fig.5 A), whereas 32D cells expressing an R-Ras(38V) mutated in the two SH3-binding domain proline residues (R-Ras(38V)-(P202A,P203A)) grew in suspension (Fig.5 B). Control cells, including those transfected with vector alone (Fig. 5 C), parental cells (not shown), and R-Ras(wt)-transfected cells (below), also remained nonadherent. To quantitate the effects of the P202A,P203A mutation on integrin-mediated cell adhesion, 32D transfectants were plated onto wells coated with varying concentrations of fibronectin. R-Ras(38V)-transfected cells adhered to fibronectin, but clones expressing the R-Ras(38V)-(P202A,P203A) mutant either did not adhere to fibronectin or adhered poorly to it (Fig. 5 D). That the various transfectants expressed equivalent levels of the transfected R-Ras was confirmed by immunoblotting cell extracts with anti-HA antibody (not shown). No adhesion was observed with R-Ras(wt)- or vector-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained when another adhesive protein, vitronectin, was used to coat the substrate. The lack of cell attachment-promoting activity by the R-Ras(38V)-(P202A,P203A) mutant was unlikely to be due to a loss of GTP binding capability, because controls showed the P202A,P203A mutation to have no effect on GTP binding by R-Ras (Fig. 6). These results indicate that the proline-rich domain contributes to the integrin activating function of R-Ras, possibly by interacting with the SH3 domains of Nck. Our results reveal an unexpected regulatory interaction of R-Ras that is mediated through binding to SH3 domains. The results single out the adaptor protein Nck as a candidate cellular protein for SH3 domain-dependent binding of R-Ras and show that the integrity of SH3 domain binding is necessary for the ability of R-Ras to regulate integrin-mediated cell attachment. The interactions of the R-Ras proline-rich domain have the hallmarks of an SH3 domain interaction. Three lines of evidence: direct binding assays with fusion proteins, two-hybrid analysis, and coimmunoprecipitation from cells, demonstrate the specificity and high avidity of the R-Ras binding to an SH3 domain of Nck. Nck is an adaptor protein comprising three consecutive SH3 domains and a C-terminal SH2 domain (41.Spaargaren M. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Fernandez-Sarabia M.J. Bischoff J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our use of SH3 domain fusion proteins in the binding assays places the interaction site in Nck to the SH3 domains, specifically to the middle SH3 domain. Moreover, our mutational analysis showed that the proline-rich segment of R-Ras, which includes three adjacent copies of the SH3 domain-binding consensus sequence PXXP, is the binding site on the R-Ras side. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an SH3 domain interaction by a small GTPase. The independence of the SH3 domain binding on the GTP/GDP regulation of R-Ras suggests that Nck (and other SH3 domain proteins that might bind to this site) functions as an adaptor, rather than as downstream effector, of R-Ras. The Nck SH3 domain fragment was the only efficient binder of the R-Ras C-terminal proline-rich sequence; fusion proteins of SH3 domains from nine other proteins showed no significant binding. The specificity of the SH3 domain binding was further underscored by the fact that only one of the three SH3 domains of Nck bound the R-Ras fragment. Moreover, we were also able to show that the Nck-R-Ras interaction takes place in cells. Specific binding of these proteins was seen in yeast two-hybrid tests, and we were also able to co-immunoprecipitate R-Ras and Nck from human cell extracts. The co-immunoprecipitation of Nck and R-Ras was only seen after transfection of the two proteins into the test cells, and only a small fraction of the transfected R-Ras appeared to be associated with Nck. This is not surprising, given the many other interactions of Nck with cellular signaling proteins. The interaction may also be regulated in such a way that only a subfraction of R-Ras is bound to Nck at any given time. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some other SH3 domain proteins might also interact with R-Ras, these results suggest that R-Ras may be a physiological ligand of Nck. The SH3 domain-binding site of R-Ras identified in this study may serve to target R-Ras to appropriate subcellular locations. The site is located in the 20 amino acids preceding the conserved C-terminal tetrapeptide motif, the CAAX box. This stretch of amino acids is highly variable among the various Ras proteins (42.Lehmann J.M. Riethmuller G. Johnson J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, it is conserved in the same Ras protein among species. The C-terminal regions of the only two R-Ras proteins for which the sequences are available, human and mouse, differ by one amino acid, and the proline-rich sequences are identical. This conservation suggests that the C-terminal region plays an important role in defining the divergent functions of the individual Ras proteins. In R-Ras, one such function appears to be SH3 domain binding. Nck, a candidate binder of R-Ras in cells, interacts through its SH2 domain with p130Cas (43.Barbacid M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 779-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar) and with activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (44.Schlaepfer D.D. Broome M.A. Hunter T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1702-1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), including Eph receptors (45.Li W. Hu P. Skolnik E.Y. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 5824-5833Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). p130Cas is a docking protein that accumulates in focal adhesions, which also contain clustered integrins (46.Holland S.J. Peles E. Pawson T. Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1998; 8: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 47.Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1996; 19: 137-145Crossref Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Nck also associates with the focal adhesion kinase (48.Choudhury G.G. Marra F. Abboud H.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: F295-F300PubMed Google Scholar). Many tyrosine kinase receptors, including the insulin, platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors are also associated with integrins (49.Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3820) Google Scholar). Thus, Nck could, by binding to these molecules through an SH2 domain interaction and to R-Ras through an SH3 domain, bring R-Ras close to integrins. In addition, Nck may be able to bind R-Ras with its middle SH3 domain while simultaneously binding another protein with its other two SH3 domains. The cytoskeleton-associated proteins WASP and dynamin are possible candidates for such binding, because they interact with a different Nck SH3 domain (the C-terminal one) than R-Ras (50.McCarthy J.H. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). How such interactions might contribute to cell adhesion regulation by R-Ras remains to be determined. We thank Dr. B. Mayer for pEBB-Nck construct, Dr. J.-L. Guan for anti-HA antibody, Dr. M. Sakaue for the GSC-NcK-S43(2) construct, and Drs. Eva Engvall and Kristiina Vuori for comments on the manuscript."

Cells undergoing apoptosis show distinct morphological changes, including membrane blebbing, cytoplasmic and nuclear condensation, chromatin aggregation, and internucleosomal cleavage of DNA. In the final stages, the dying cells become fragmented into “apoptotic bodies,” which are rapidly eliminated by phagocytic cells without eliciting significant inflammatory damage to surrounding cells. Many of the typical changes observed in cells undergoing apoptosis have been attributed to the limited proteolysis of a number of key substrates by a family of well conserved proteases, the caspases (reviewed in Refs. 2.Wolf B.B.

Activation occurs by one of two mechanisms, autocatalytic processing induced by their aggregation and/or cleavage by other caspases (2.Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20049-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Based on their substrate specificity, caspases have been grouped into three subfamilies (4.Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M. Houtzager V.M. Nordstrom P.A. Roy S. Vaillancourt J.P. Chapman K.T. Nicholson D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17907-17911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). Group I caspases (e.g. caspase 1, 4, and 5) prefer the tetrapeptide sequence WEHD and have been implicated mainly in inflammatory processes rather than in apoptosis. Group II (e.g. caspases 2, 3, and 7) and group III (e.g. caspases 6, 8, 9, and 10) caspases have the recognition consensus sequence DEXD and (I/L/V)EXD, respectively, and are involved in apoptosis. The different caspases have also been grouped by function into apoptotic initiators (caspase-2, 8, 9, and 10), apoptotic executioners (caspase-3, 6, and 7), and cytokine processors (caspases 1, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 14). Apoptotic initiators such as caspase-8 directly interact with death receptors through their amino-terminal death effector domains or caspase recruitment domains, resulting in an activation of the apoptotic pathway. Apoptotic executioners like caspase-3 are considered the downstream effector proteases responsible for the proteolysis of key substrates later in apoptosis. Caspase-3 has been shown to be required for morphological changes associated with apoptosis as well as for DNA fragmentation by the caspase-activated DNase (also known as DNA fragmentation factor) (5.Tang D. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). In vivo, caspase 3 appears to be essential for brain development but dispensable for apoptosis in other organs (7.Kuida K. Zheng T.S. Na S. Kuan C. Yang D. Karasuyama H. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar). In cell culture, the natural caspase-3 “knock-out” cell line MCF-7 (6.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar, 8.Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 13618-13623Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) are able to die upon apoptotic stimuli, but do not display DNA fragmentation, nuclear breakdown, or membrane blebbing. To understand the molecular basis of the apoptotic process, it is therefore necessary to identify the key substrates that must be cleaved to commit the cell to die and to elucidate the substrate specificities of caspases in vivo. We have focused on morphological and biochemical changes that are associated with one of the most dramatic reactions in apoptosis, the decomposition of the internal architecture of the cell nucleus. During this work, we have recently found that scaffold attachment factor A (SAF-A)1 is a target in apoptotic nuclear breakdown (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 11.Treuner K. Okuyama A. Knippers R. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SAF-A is an abundant component of the nuclear scaffold (nuclear matrix) and also occurs in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes. Our previous findings have implicated the protein in nuclear organization due to its high binding specificity toward architectural DNA elements in the genome, the so-called scaffold or matrix attachment regions (12.Romig H. Fackelmayer F.O. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3431-3440Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Indeed, we and others have shown that SAF-A is one of the major scaffold attachment region binding proteins in human cells that appears to fasten the base of chromatin loops to the nuclear scaffold (13.Göhring F. Fackelmayer F.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8276-8283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14.Fackelmayer F.O. Dahm K. Renz A. Ramsperger U. Richter A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15.Fackelmayer F.O. Richter A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10416-10422Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 16.Mattern K.A. Humbel B.M. Muijsers A.O. De Jong L. Van Driel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17.Mattern K.A. van der Kraan I. Schul W. de Jong L. van Driel R. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). During apoptosis, but not necrosis, SAF-A is cleaved by a single cut in the amino-terminal third of the protein, resulting in a loss of DNA binding activity and a concomitant detachment of the protein from the nuclear scaffold (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Thus, cleavage of SAF-A might be linked to critical alterations in nuclear chromatin that occur before caspase-activated DNase-catalyzed cleavage of DNA into oligonucleosomal fragments. Cleavage of SAF-A occurs after the formation of high molecular weight DNA fragments but before DNA laddering and can be blocked by peptide inhibitors of caspases (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These results suggested that cleavage of SAF-A might be catalyzed by a downstream caspase, although no caspase recognition consensus sequence is evident in the primary structure of the protein. To clarify this point, we have decided to identify the protease responsible for SAF-A cleavage and to precisely map the cleavage site on the protein. Jurkat cells were grown in very low endotoxin-RPMI 1640 medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 10% fetal calf serum and COS7 and MCF-7 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 0.6 μg/ml insulin (for MCF-7 cells only). All cells were kept at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere and passaged every 3 days by 5-fold dilution into fresh medium. Cells were transfected with expression vectors using the SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For induction of apoptosis, Jurkat cells were pelleted for 5 min at 190 × g and washed twice in serum-free medium before the addition of anti-CD95 antibody (CH-11, Immunotech, final concentration 100 ng/ml). Apoptotic cells were harvested 4 h later. COS7 and MCF-7 cells were induced to die apoptotically by incubation with staurosporine at final concentrations between 0.6 and 10 μm for 24 h in complete medium (18.Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Total cell extracts were prepared as described previously (11.Treuner K. Okuyama A. Knippers R. Fackelmayer F.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1499-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The caspase-3 expression vector was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the cDNA of the 32-kDa precursor (a kind gift of Dr. Junying Yuan) with primers CGCGGATCCGGAGAACACTGAAAACTC and CCGGGATCCAATCATATGGTGATGATGGTGGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTCTTT, incorporating oneBamHI restriction site each and a carboxyl-terminal 6×His tag. Polymerase chain reaction conditions were 5 min/95 °C pretreatment, then 30 cycles of 1 min/50 °C, 2 min/72 °C, 1 min/95 °C, followed by 1 min/50 °C, 5 min/72 °C post-treatment using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) at 2.5 units/100-μl reaction, 50 pmol of each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, and 1 ng of template. The resulting 0.9-kilobase fragment was cloned into theBamHI site of the pET15b bacterial expression vector. The carboxyl-terminal myc-tagged SAF-A expression clone was created by polymerase chain reaction using our full-length SAF-A cDNA clone (accession number AF068846) in pBluescriptII SK− as a template. In a first step, this clone was amplified to yield a linear fragment of 5.8 kilobases containing the complete cDNA and the bluescript vector but removing the 0.8 kilobase 3′-nontranslated region and creating terminal KpnI sites and a SalI site at the position of the stop codon (which is thereby destroyed). Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 100-μl reactions containing standardPfu reaction buffer supplemented with 2% Me2SO, 50 ng of template, 7.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), 400 μm each dNTP, and 50 pmol each of the primers CCCGGTACCCAATTCGCCCTATAGTGAG and CATGGTACCGTCGACATAATATCCTTGGTGATAATGC. Cycling conditions were 7.5 min/95 °C pretreatment, then 30 cycles of 1 min/55 °C, 12 min/72 °C, 1.5 min/95 °C, followed by 1 min/50 °C, 15 min/72 °C post-treatment. The resulting fragment was gel-purified, digested with KpnI, circularized by ligation, and transformed into XL1-blue E. coli. Positive clones were identified by DNA minipreparations and verified by sequencing. The BamHI/SalI fragment from this clone (containing a 142-base pair 5′-nontranslated region, the natural start codon, and the SAF-A-encoding region) was isolated and cloned 3′ in-frame into the pCMV-Tag1 vector (Stratagene) to yield the SAF-A/myc expression clone used in this paper. Positive clones were identified by DNA minipreparations and diagnostic digests and were verified by sequencing. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer using the SAF-A/myc expression clone described above and mutagenesis primers GAATCTCCGCTCTGGCCGGCGACCAGATGGAG and CTCCATCTGGTCGCCGGCGCGAGCGGAGATTC. Positive clones were identified by DNA minipreparations, a diagnostic NgoMIV digestion, and verified by sequencing. For purification of active 6×His-tagged caspase-3, the expression clone was transformed into BL21[DE3]lysS bacteria. A freshly transformed colony was picked to inoculate 500 ml of expression medium (LB supplemented with 0.5 × M9 salts, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and grown to A 600 = 0.8 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Bacteria were harvested after 3 h by centrifugation (6000 ×g, 5 min), resuspended in 20 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2% Triton X-100, 150 μg/ml lysozyme), frozen overnight, and lysed by thawing slowly. NaCl and imidazole were added to 500 mm and 5 mm, respectively, the bacterial DNA was sheared by sonication, and the lysate was cleared by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 30 min). The supernatant, containing active caspase-3, was mixed with 1 ml of nickel nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) and incubated on a rocking platform for 1 h. The resin was washed with 10 volumes of buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mmmercaptoethanol), and bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient from 0 to 100 mm imidazole in buffer A. Active fractions were made 40% in glycerol and 50 mm in dithiothreitol and stored at −20 °C. The yield was approximately 0.5 mg from 500 ml of bacterial culture, with an average specific activity of 3.6 × 107 unit/mg as determined by the fluorometric caspase-3 assay described below. Note that caspase-3 was cloned as a the 32-kDa precursor but was recovered from expressing bacteria as the processed, active form, presumably because of autocatalytic proteolysis. Caspase-3 activity was assayed by DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin cleavage as described (19.Thornberry N.A. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 615-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The assay was carried out in microtiter plates with a substrate concentration of 40 μm and 3 ng of recombinant caspase-3. Cleavage of DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin was followed in caspase-3 reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS) over a period of 30 min at 37 °C with λex = 390 nm and λem = 505 nm, and the activity was calibrated with 7-amido-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin standard solutions. One unit was defined as formation of 1 pmol of 7-amido-4-trifluoro-methylcoumarin/min. For cleavage site mapping by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (20.Przybylski M. Adv. Mass Spectrom. 1995; 13: 257-283Google Scholar), 10 μg of recombinant ZZ-N247 protein (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was incubated with 50 ng (180 units) of purified caspase-3 for 2 h at 37 °C in caspase-3 reaction buffer (see above) in a total volume of 10 μl. One-tenth of the cleavage reaction was mixed with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Aldrich; dissolved in acetonitrile:water 2:1, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and allowed to dry on a MALDI target. The target was washed with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid three times before an additional 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was applied and allowed to dry. MALDI-MS analysis was performed with a Bruker-Biflex linear mass spectrometer (Bruker-Franzen) equipped with an OEM VSL 337 nitrogen laser (λ= 337 nm, bandwidth 0.1 nm) and pulses of 3 ns. Instrumental conditions of data acquisition and evaluation were as described previously (21.Bühler S. Michels J. Wendt S. Rück A. Brdiczka D. Welte W. Przybylski M. Proteins. 1998; Suppl. 2: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For cleavage site mapping by amino acid sequencing, 50 μg of purified recombinant ZZ-N247 was incubated with 200 ng (720 units) of purified caspase-3 for 2 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (22.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using the buffer system described by Matsudaira (23.Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and the two fragments were cut out for sequencing in an automated amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Model 477A). Wild type SAF-A, carboxyl-terminal myc-tagged SAF-A, and the D100A-mutated version thereof were produced and labeled with [35S]methionine by coupled in vitro transcription/translation using the T3 RNA polymerase-based TNT system (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. The full-length SAF-A cDNA in pBluescript and the expression clones described above were used as templates. One-fifth of each 50-μl reaction was dialyzed against caspase-3 reaction buffer (see above) for 2 h in the cold, mixed with 10 ng (36 units) of purified caspase-3, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The mixtures were separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography using Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We have previously described SAF-A as cleaved during apoptosis in Jurkat leukemic T-lymphocytes exposed to anti-CD95 (Fas, Apo-1) antibodies (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In this well established model system for apoptosis, caspase-3 is known to be the major effector protease responsible for cleavage of most “death substrate” proteins (24.Krammer P.H. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 71: 163-210Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, cleavage of SAF-A can be blocked by DEVD-CHO (10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), a peptide inhibitor of caspase-3 and caspase-3 like activities (25.Garcia-Calvo M. Peterson E.P. Leiting B. Ruel R. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32608-32613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). Our findings suggested that caspase-3 might also be responsible for cleavage of SAF-A, even though an amino acid motif conforming to the accepted caspase-3 consensus DEXD (or the weaker DXXD) sequence is not present in the primary structure of SAF-A. To investigate this point, we have cloned, expressed, and purified human recombinant caspase-3 (Fig. 1 A,right panel) and performed in vitro cleavage assays with purified native SAF-A from human cells. Indeed, incubation of SAF-A with small amounts of recombinant caspase-3 resulted in cleavage of SAF-A to yield a fragment indistinguishable by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from that found in apoptotic cells (Fig. 1 A, left panel).Thus, SAF-A can be cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro. To confirm this cleavage, we repeated the in vitro cleavage assays with a recombinant fusion protein from the amino terminus of SAF-A (ZZ-N247, see Ref. 10.Göhring F. Schwab B.L. Nicotera P. Leist M. Fackelmayer F.O. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7361-7371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholarfor details). We found that this model substrate could be cleaved by caspase-3 (Fig. 1 B, left panel) and that cleavage could be counteracted by the caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO (Fig.1 B, right panel), both in a concentration-dependent manner. These titration experiments show that SAF-A is cleaved by recombinant pure caspase-3 at concentrations comparable with estimated cellular concentrations, reflecting very efficient proteolysis in vitro. Thus, cleavage of SAF-A does not result from unphysiological high concentrations of caspase-3. We concluded that SAF-A is cleaved by caspase-3 at a hitherto unknown cleavage site and that the model substrate ZZ-N247 is well suited for mapping this cleavage site. To this end, recombinant ZZ-N247 was cleaved by recombinant caspase-3, and proteolytic products were analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometric mapping and Edman amino acid sequencing. The MALDI-MS analysis established the formation of two exclusive cleavage products with molecular masses of 24,645 and 16,956 kDa (Fig.2 A), which precisely correspond to fragments (1–224) and (225–389) of the model protein. Amino acid sequencing of the proteolytic products after transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Fig. 2 B) yielded the amino-terminal sequences AQHDEAVD (8 cycles) and GDQMELGEENGAAG (14 cycles), respectively. These results unequivocally identified the caspase-3 cleavage site in SAF-A to Asp-100 of the tetrapeptide sequence SALD. This cleavage site has not been observed in other caspase-3 substrates before nor does it conform to the presumed DEXD consensus. In addition, searches of the SWISSPROT and TrEMBL data bases gave no indication of a preferred occurrence of the SALD sequence in other known protein substrates of caspase-3, suggesting that it is not possible to deduce caspase cleavage sites from protein sequence information alone.Figure 2Cleavage site mapping. A, 1 μg of recombinant ZZ-N247 was analyzed by MALDI-MS before (upper panel) and after (lower panel) cleavage with 5 ng of purified caspase-3 for 2 h at 37 °C. Experimentally determined masses of the ZZ-N247 protein and the two cleavage products are indicated. Note that the peaks of the singly, doubly, and triply protonated ions are seen for all peptides. Calculated masses are 41,619 for ZZ-N247 or 24,662 and 16,957 for the two cleavage products, respectively. B, 50 μg of purified recombinant ZZ-N247 was incubated with 200 ng (720 units) of purified caspase-3 for 2 h at 37 °C. Cleavage products were separated on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, cut out, and sequenced in an automated amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Model 477A). Determined sequences are identical to the predicted sequences from the amino terminus of the ZZ-N247 protein (fragment 1) and the sequence starting from amino acid 101 in SAF-A (fragment 2). The determined cleavage site is shown in its natural sequence context at the bottom of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Precise mapping of the cleavage site enabled us to introduce a point mutation to confirm that Asp-100 is indeed the site cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro and possibly also in vivo. To this end, we constructed a clone encoding full-length SAF-A with a single amino acid exchange D100A. The corresponding protein as well as wild type controls in two different vectors were produced and radioactively labeled by coupled in vitrotranscription/translation and subjected to recombinant caspase-3. Fig.3 demonstrates that, at least in vitro, cleavage of SAF-A was completely blocked in the alanine-containing mutated protein but not in wild type SAF-A. To investigate the in vivo relevance of our cleavage site mapping, we transfected a wild type and a mutated form of carboxyl-terminal myc-tagged SAF-A into COS7 cells. These cells are quite resistant to many apoptotic stimuli including 0.5 μm staurosporine, which is sufficient to induce apoptosis in many other cell types. However, staurosporine at 10 μmwas effective in producing >80% apoptotic cells after 24 h (Fig.4 A). When applied to cells transfected with SAF-A expression clones, we found that the D100A mutant, but not the transfected wild-type, was completely resistant to cleavage (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). In the same samples, endogenous SAF-A was cleaved equally in all cells transfected with either enhanced green fluorescent protein (a control to estimate transfection efficiency and to rule out general transfection-related problems) or wild type or mutated SAF-A. Thus, the cleavage site mapped by using a recombinant model substrate and recombinant caspase-3in vitro is identical to the cleavage site used in vivo. The experiments described above clearly show that SAF-A is cleaved by caspase-3 at aspartate 100 in vitro and that the same cleavage site is used in vivo but do not rigorously exclude that a protease other than caspase-3 is responsible for cleavage of SAF-A in vivo. To test this, we made use of the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 that is devoid of caspase-3 due to a deletion in the caspase-3 gene (6.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9357-9360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1733) Google Scholar). These cells can be induced to undergo apoptosis by a variety of stimuli that are also effective in other cells, although characteristic caspase-3 substrates are not cleaved, DNA is not cut to oligonucleosomal fragments, and some morphological changes typical for apoptotic cells are absent (5.Tang D. Kidd V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28549-28552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 6.Janicke R.U. Sprengart M.L. Wati M.R. Porter A.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3679-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). In parallel experiments, we induced apoptosis in COS7 cells and in MCF-7 cells by staurosporine (compare Fig. 4 A). We found that SAF-A was not cleaved in MCF-7 cells in the entire tested range of 0.6 to 10 μm staurosporine, whereas in COS7 cells, the protein was cleaved as described above. Fig. 5 shows an example of such an experiment performed with 5 μmstaurosporine, where both MCF-7 and COS7 cells display clear apoptotic phenotype, with rounding of cells and detachment from the culture plate. We conclude that caspase-3 is necessary and sufficient for cleavage of SAF-A in vivo, and that no other caspase can compensate for caspase-3, as e.g. in the case of other death substrates (8.Janicke R.U. Ng P. Sprengart M.L. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified the protease responsible for cleavage of SAF-A during apoptosis and precisely mapped the cleavage site on the protein. We demonstrate that caspase-3 cleaves SAF-A at aspartate 100 both in vitro and in vivousing a cleavage site (SALD) that does not conform to the caspase-3 consensus DEXD. Apoptotic cell death is associated with a variety of morphological and biochemical changes that are independent from the initiating death signal (27.Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cotter T.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 26-30Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the decomposition of the cell nucleus induced by proteolytic cleavage of key nuclear proteins by caspases and degradation of DNA to oligonucleosomal pieces (28.Earnshaw W.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). As in the case of structural changes in the cytoplasm, the identification of nuclear caspase substrates has provided first insights into how a limited number of cuts i"
https://openalex.org/W1980449471,"The cytokine oncostatin M (OM) activates human low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene transcription through a sterol-independent mechanism. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory have narrowed the OM-responsive element to promoter region −52 to +13, which contains the repeat 3 and two TATA-like sequences. We now identify LDLR promoter region −17 to −1 as a sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) that is critically involved in OM-, transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-, and second messenger cAMP-mediated activation of LDLR transcription. The SIRE sequence overlaps the previously described TATA-like element and consists of an active C/EBP-binding site (−17 to −9) and a functional cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (−8 to −1). We demonstrate that (a) mutations within either the C/EBP or CRE site have no impact on basal or cholesterol-mediated repression of LDLR transcription, but they completely abolish OM-mediated activation of LDLR transcription; (b) replacing the repeat 3 sequence that contains the Sp1-binding site with a yeast transcription factor GAL4-binding site in the LDLR promoter construct does not affect OM inducibility, thereby demonstrating that OM induction is mediated through the SIRE sequence in conjunction with a strong activator bound to the repeat 3 sequence; (c) electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays confirm the specific binding of transcription factors C/EBP and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein to the SIRE; (d) cotransfection of a human C/EBPβ expression vector (pEF-NFIL6) with the LDLR promoter construct pLDLR234 increases LDLR promoter activity; and (e) OM and dibutyryl cAMP synergistically activate LDLR transcription through this regulatory element. This study identifies, for the first time, acis-acting regulatory element in the LDLR promoter that is responsible for sterol-independent regulation of LDLR transcription. The cytokine oncostatin M (OM) activates human low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene transcription through a sterol-independent mechanism. Previous studies conducted in our laboratory have narrowed the OM-responsive element to promoter region −52 to +13, which contains the repeat 3 and two TATA-like sequences. We now identify LDLR promoter region −17 to −1 as a sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE) that is critically involved in OM-, transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-, and second messenger cAMP-mediated activation of LDLR transcription. The SIRE sequence overlaps the previously described TATA-like element and consists of an active C/EBP-binding site (−17 to −9) and a functional cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (−8 to −1). We demonstrate that (a) mutations within either the C/EBP or CRE site have no impact on basal or cholesterol-mediated repression of LDLR transcription, but they completely abolish OM-mediated activation of LDLR transcription; (b) replacing the repeat 3 sequence that contains the Sp1-binding site with a yeast transcription factor GAL4-binding site in the LDLR promoter construct does not affect OM inducibility, thereby demonstrating that OM induction is mediated through the SIRE sequence in conjunction with a strong activator bound to the repeat 3 sequence; (c) electrophoretic mobility shift and supershift assays confirm the specific binding of transcription factors C/EBP and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein to the SIRE; (d) cotransfection of a human C/EBPβ expression vector (pEF-NFIL6) with the LDLR promoter construct pLDLR234 increases LDLR promoter activity; and (e) OM and dibutyryl cAMP synergistically activate LDLR transcription through this regulatory element.

The positive regulatory elements within this region were identified as three GC-rich imperfect 16-base pair direct repeats and two TA-rich TATA-like sequences of 7 base pairs each. Repeats 1 and 3 contain transcription factor Sp1-binding sites. Interference in Sp1 binding to either repeat severely decreases basal transcriptional activity. Sterols regulate LDLR transcription through a 10-base pair sequence within repeat 2 designated as sterol regulatory element-1 (SRE-1) (4.Smith J.R. Osborne T.F. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

When intracellular cholesterol is low, SRE-binding protein-1 and -2 bind to the SRE-1 sequence and interact with Sp1 in repeat 3, thereby activating LDLR transcription (6.Wang X. Briggs M.R.

To date, no studies have been conducted to investigate further how the TATA-like sequences affect LDLR transcription, and the trans-acting factors that bind to this promoter region have not been identified. In addition to cholesterol, LDLR transcription can also be regulated by nonsterol mediators, including hormones (10.Rudling M. Norstedt G. Olivecrona H. Reihner E. Gustafsson J. Angelin B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6983-6987Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), growth factors (11.Pak Y.K. Kanuck M.P. Berrios D. Briggs M.R. Cooper A.D. Ellsworth J.L. J.

Pharmacol. 1988; 67: 968-973Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, the cis-acting elements that control LDLR transcription through sterol-independent pathways have not been identified. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying sterol-independent regulation, we previously dissected the promoter region that could be responsible for cytokine oncostatin M (OM)-induced activation of LDLR transcription (15.Liu J. Grove R.I. Vestal R.E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1333-1338PubMed Google Scholar), as OM has been shown to increase the expression of LDLR protein and mRNA independent of intracellular cholesterol (14.Grove R.I. Mazzucco C.E. Radka S.F. Shoyab M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18194-18199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown that mutations of the SRE-1 site or deletion of the repeat 2 sequence to completely eliminate SRE-binding protein binding has no effect on OM inducibility of LDLR promoter activity (16.Liu J. Streiff R. Zhang Y.L. Vestal R.E. Spence M.J. Briggs M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2035-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion analysis further narrowed down the OM-responsive element in the promoter region from −52 to +13 (17.Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This region contains the two TATA-like sequences and repeat 3. In this study, we performed detailed mutagenic analysis in this promoter region to identify the cis-regulatory element that mediates the OM activity of the LDLR promoter. We provide the first evidence to demonstrate that OM activity is mediated through promoter region −17 to −1 in conjunction with the strong activator Sp1 bound to the repeat 3 sequence. We have designated this promoter region (−17 to −1) as a sterol-independent regulatory element (SIRE). The SIRE overlaps with the previously described TATA-like sequences and consists of an active CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding site (−17 to −9) and a functional cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (−8 to −1). The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and was cultured in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Summit Biotechnology, Fort Collins, CO). Antibodies specific to the following proteins were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology for use in supershift EMSAs: C/EBPα, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, CREB-1, CREB-2, CREM-1, CREB/ATF-1 (recognizes all CREB/ATF family proteins), ATF-1, ATF-2, c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, XBP-1, CREB-binding protein, and TATA-binding protein. Construction of plasmids pLDLR234, pLDLR-R3, and pLDLR-TATA has been described previously (17.Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To construct the mutant vectors (pLDLR-R3-mu6 to pLDLR-R3-mu11), double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the LDLR promoter sequence from −52 to +13 with single-base substitutions were synthesized withSacI and HindIII sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively, and inserted into pGL3-basic vector. The mutant sequences are shown in Fig. 1. The vector pLDLR-GAL4 was constructed by cloning a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the LDLR promoter sequence from −36 to +13 and a GAL4-binding site with SacI andHindIII sites (italic) at the 5′- and 3′-ends (C tcggagtactgtcctccgatcgtagaaacctcacattgaaatgctgtaaatgacgtgggccccgagtgcaatA) into pGL3-basic vector. The GAL4 sequence is underlined. The vector pLDLR-GAL4-TATA2MU was constructed as described above with the exception that the TATA2 site contains a 3-base substitution (TGTAAA → TGcggA). The plasmid pSG-GAL4-Sp1 encoding the yeast transcription factor GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the N-terminal glutamine-rich activation domain of Sp1 and pSG-GAL4 DBD encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain only (18.Emami K.H. Navarre W.W. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5906-5916Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Smale (UCLA). The plasmid pFA-GAL4 encoding the full-length GAL4 protein was generously provided by Dr. ChaoFeng Zheng (Stratagene). The plasmid pEF-NFIL6 was a gift from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Hyogo College of Medicine, Hyogo, Japan). The plasmid pLDLR234 was used as a template for making mutants utilizing the QuikChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Correct clones were screened by restriction digestion and verified by dideoxy sequencing. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Dignam et al. (19.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar), except that buffer A was supplemented with 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa2MoO4, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 nm okadaic acid, 10 nm cypermethrin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 2 mmdithiothreitol. Oligonucleotide probes were annealed and labeled by 3′-fill-in using Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. Each binding reaction was composed of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 6 μg of nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl. Nuclear extracts were incubated with 0.4–0.5 ng of32P-labeled double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide probe (40–80 × 103 cpm) for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and run in TGE buffer (50 mm Tris base, 400 mm glycine, and 1.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.5) at 180 V for 3 h at 4 °C. The gels were dried and visualized on a PhosphorImager. In competition analysis, nuclear extracts were incubated with a 2–200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNA for 5 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. For supershift assays, antibody was incubated with nuclear extract for 30–60 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the probe. The sense sequences of EMSA probes were as follows: TATA1+2, 5′-CATTGAAATGCTGTAAATGACGTGGGCCCC-3′; repeat 3, 5′-TTCGAAACTCCTCCCCCTGCTAG-3′; and p53, 5′-AGCTAGGGCTTGCTTGAACAGGGTCT-3′. The Sp1- and p53-binding sites are underlined. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with plasmid DNA by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method (16.Liu J. Streiff R. Zhang Y.L. Vestal R.E. Spence M.J. Briggs M.R. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 2035-2048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To demonstrate sterol-independent regulation, cells transfected with pLDLR234 or mutant vectors were cultured in medium containing 10% lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) or LPDS plus cholesterol (10 μg/ml cholesterol + 1 μg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol). Twenty hours after transfection, OM (50 ng/ml) or dibutyryl cAMP at the indicated concentrations was added. After 4 h of treatment, cells were lysed, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed. Absolute luciferase activity was normalized against β-galactosidase activity to correct for transfection efficiency. Comparisons of experimental data were analyzed by a two-tailed Student's t test. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Our previous study showed that the minimal LDLR promoter construct pLDLR-R3 responds to OM stimulation to a degree similar to that of the full promoter construct pLDLR234, suggesting that the OM-responsive element is localized within promoter region −52 to +13, which contains the repeat 3 and two TATA-like sequences (17.Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To firmly examine the relationship between Sp1 binding to the repeat 3 sequence and OM inducibility, several mutant vectors with single-base substitutions (R3-mu6 to R3-mu11) within the core Sp1-binding site (CTCCTCCC) were constructed by insertion of double-stranded oligonucleotides containing LDLR promoter sequence −52 to +13 with designed mutations into the pGL3-basic-luciferase vector. These reporters, along with the β-galactosidase expression vector BG2-βgal, were transiently transfected into HepG2 cells. Fig.1 A illustrates a representative experiment that shows the normalized luciferase activities of untreated and OM-treated HepG2 cells transfected with each individual vector. These data show that pLDLR-TATA had very low luciferase activity at a level similar to that of the promoterless vector pGL3-basic. The effect of OM on this vector was insignificant, generally <5% of the OM activity on the vector pLDLR-R3. Including a single copy of repeat 3 sequence in the pLDLR-TATA vector increased promoter activity ∼4–5-fold, and vector pLDLR-R3 responded to OM stimulation with a 3-fold increase in promoter activity. The effects of repeat 3 mutation on basal and OM-induced promoter activities are presented in Fig. 1 (B and C) using data derived from five independent transfections. Fig. 1 B compares the basal promoter activities of all repeat 3 mutants. The response of each mutant to OM stimulation is illustrated in Fig. 1 C. With the exception of R3-mu9, which did not change basal or OM-induced promoter activity, all other mutants reduced basal promoter activity nearly to the level of pLDLR-TATA. However, none of these mutations abolished OM activity completely. These data suggest that Sp1 binding to the repeat 3 sequence is required for OM-induced activation of LDLR transcription, but the repeat 3 sequence may not be the only cis-regulatory element in this promoter region (−52 to +13) to mediate OM activity. Gel shift assays using HepG2 nuclear extract and a32P-labeled oligonucleotide containing the repeat 3 sequence were conducted to examine the Sp1 binding to the mutant repeat 3 sequences. As shown in Fig. 2, Sp1 and Sp3 binding to the probe was competed by the double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either the wild-type repeat 3 sequence or the mutant sequence in R3-mu9, but it was not competed by the oligonucleotides that carry the same mutations as those in the vectors of R3-mu6, R3-mu7, R3-mu8, R3-mu10, and R3-mu11. These data clearly demonstrate that loss of the basal promoter activities of these mutants was due to loss of Sp1 binding. To examine the functions of the DNA sequence 3′ of repeat 3 in basal and OM-stimulated transcription, site-directed mutagenesis was conducted on the pLDLR234 vector to generate mutations within the two TATA-like sequences, TATA1 (−23 to −17) and TATA2 (−14 to −8), and a putative CRE (−8 to −1) that overlaps with TATA2. Fig.3 shows that none of the mutations affected cholesterol regulation; promoter activities of all of the constructs were repressed by sterol to a similar degree. However, OM inducibility was completely abolished in the TATA2 mutant (TATA2a) and the CRE mutant (CREMU1) and only partially reduced in the TATA1 mutant (TATA1b). Computer-aided sequence analysis suggested that the TATA-like sequences contain a potential C/EBP-binding site (TGCTGTAAA, −17 to −9) that includes the 3′-base pair of TATA1 and the TATA2 sequence except the most 3′-base pair of TATA2, which is included in the putative CRE site (Table I). To further demonstrate that OM activity is mediated through the putative C/EBP site and the CRE site, several reporter vectors with altered nucleotides in the 5′-region of the C/EBP site (TATA1a) and the 3′-region of the CRE site (TATAMU3d and TATAMU3e) were constructed, along with two additional mutants of the C/EBP site (TATA2b) and the CRE site (TATAMU3c). The results are summarized in Table I. The mutation in TATA1a with base substitutions in the 5′-end of TATA1 but outside the C/EBP site lowered basal activity to 59% of the wild-type level, but had no effect on OM inducibility. In comparison, the mutation in TATA1b lowered basal promoter activity to 69% of the wild-type level and also slightly decreased OM activity from 4- to 2.9-fold. This is most likely due to the A-to-G substitution immediately adjacent to the C/EBP-binding site. These data suggest that the TATA1 site contributes to basal promoter activity, but is dispensable for the OM response. In contrast, basal promoter activities were unchanged in C/EBP mutants TATA2a and TATA2b and in the CRE mutant CREMU1 and only slightly decreased in the CRE mutant TATAMU3c, but OM stimulation in these mutant vectors was completely abolished. Farther downstream mutations in the 3′-region of the CRE site slightly decreased basal promoter activity (73–83% of the wild-type level) without affecting OM-induced promoter activity. These data clearly localized a novel SIRE in promoter region −17 to −1 that is critically involved in the OM-mediated activation of LDLR transcription.Table IEffects of mutations within the TATA1 (TTGAAAT, −23 to −17), TATA2 (TGTAAAT, −14 to −8), and CRE (−8 to −1) sites on basal and OM-stimulated promoter activitiesConstructTATA1, TATA2, and 3′-flanking sequence (−25 to +5)BasalActivity (-Fold of wildtype)OM stimulatedActivity (-Fold of control)*Wild type (pLDLR234)CATTGAAATGCTGTAAA TGACGTGGGCCCC1.00 ± 0.14 (n = 6)4.0 ± 0.88 (n = 6)TATA1aCATcGcAATGCTGTAAA TGACGTGGGCCCC0.59 ± 0.03ap < 0.001 compared with control.

The major transcription start site is indicated by the asterisk. To determine whether Sp1 binding to repeat 3 is necessary for OM to function through the SIRE, the repeat 3 sequence in pLDLR-R3 was replaced by a GAL4-binding site to create the vector pLDLR-GAL4, and the repeat 3 sequence in a TATA2 mutant of pLDLR-R3 was replaced by a GAL4 site to generate pLDLR-GAL4-TATA2MU. These two reporter constructs were cotransfected with expression vectors that express the GAL4 DNA-binding domain only (GAL4 DBD), the full-length GAL4 protein (GAL4), or a fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the Sp1 activation domain (GAL4-Sp1). The results in Fig.4 show that the promoter activities of both wild-type pLDLR-GAL4 and mutant pLDLR-GAL4-TATA2MU were increased by cotransfection with transcription factor GAL4 or the GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein, but were not affected by cotransfection with the GAL4 DBD, which does not contain a transactivation domain. OM did not increase wild-type promoter activity with cotransfection of the GAL4 DBD. However, OM increased the pLDLR-GAL4 promoter activities to the same extent (2–3-fold) with cotransfection of either GAL4 or GAL4-Sp1. This OM activity was totally abolished in the promoter construct pLDLR-GAL4-TATAMU2, which carries a mutation in the SIRE site. These results clearly demonstrate that the OM activity of LDLR transcription is mediated through the SIRE site in conjunction with a strong activator bound to the repeat 3 sequence. To detect transcription factors that bind to the SIRE, gel shift assays using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe (TATA1+2) containing LDLR promoter sequence −25 to +5 were performed with nuclear extracts prepared from untreated and OM-treated HepG2 cells. Three DNA-protein complexes (C1, C3, and C4) were detected in control extracts, and 4 complexes (C1, C2, C3, and C4) were detected in OM-treated extracts (Fig. 5 A). Formation of these complexes was inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotide TATA1+2, but was not inhibited by a 100-fold molar excess of oligonucleotides containing binding sites for Sp1 (repeat 3) or p53, demonstrating the specificity of the binding. In contrast to the TATA1+2 probe, the binding of Sp1 to the32P-labeled repeat 3 probe was not altered by OM treatment (Fig. 5 B). Fig. 6 shows the time-dependent induction of the C2 complex by OM. C2 was detected in OM-treated cells after 30 min, and the intensity of C2 appeared to increase with longer OM treatment. Interestingly, the OM-induced appearance of the C2 complex on the SIRE element was totally inhibited by treating cells with U0126, an inhibitor of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) upstream kinase MEK (20.Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van Dyk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol.

These data suggest that the binding of C2 to SIRE site depends on the ERK-induced phosphorylation of protein components of C2.Figure 6Time-dependent induction of the C2 complex by OM.

Nuclear extracts were incubated with the 32P-labeled TATA1+2 probe and analyzed by EMSA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Supershift EMSA analyses with antibodies directed against several members of the C/EBP and CREB families were conducted to characterize the transcription factors present in these DNA-protein complexes. The C3 complex in both control extracts (Fig.7 A) and OM-treated extracts (Fig. 7 B) was completely supershifted by anti-CREB-1 (lanes 2 and 3) and anti-CREM-1 (lane 8) antibodies. Antibodies against ATF-1 (lane 4) and ATF-2 (lane 5), two other members of the CREB family, supershifted the C1 complex and also slightly decreased the intensity of C3. Anti-C/EBPβ antibody produced a supershift band and slightly decreased the intensity of C3 in control extracts (lane 9). In OM-treated extracts, the intensities of C3 and OM-induced C2 were both slightly decreased by anti-C/EBPβ antibody. Anti-C/EBPδ antibody produced a supershift band only in the OM-treated extracts (Fig. 7 B, lane 11), whereas anti-C/EBPα antibody generated a faint supershift band in both control and OM-treated extracts (lane 10). In comparison with the control extract, the intensities of supershifted bands produced by antibodies against ATF-1 (Fig. 7 B, lane 4) and ATF-2 (lane 5) with OM-treated extract were decreased. In contrast, antibodies against CREB-binding protein (lane 6), CREB-2 (lane 7), and the TATA-binding protein and TATA-binding protein-associated factors TAF130 and TAF100 (data not shown) had no effect. It is known that the consensus binding site (TGACT) for activator protein-1 (AP-1), which is composed of a c-Jun homodimer or a c-Jun and c-Fos heterodimer, overlaps with the CRE site (TGACGTCA) (21.Lalli E.

Chem. 1998; 273: 5211-5218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), we were interested to determine whether the OM-induced C2 complex contains AP-1. Supershift assays with antibodies that recognize c-Jun, JunB, c-Fos, and XBP-1 were performed using OM-treated nuclear extract. XBP-1 is another member of the leucine zipper family of transcription factors that also binds to the CRE, and XBP-1 was shown to be regulated by interleukin-6 (24.Wen X.Y. Stewart A.K. Sooknanan R.R. Henderson G. Hawley T.S. Reimold A.M. Glimcher L.H. Baumann H. Malek L.T. Hawley R.G. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 173-178PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 7 C shows that antibodies to c-Fos, JunB, and XBP-1 had no effect on any of the four complexes. All three antibodies to c-Jun supershifted the C1 complex, but none of these anti-c-Jun antibodies affected the C2 complex. These data suggest that the C1 complex may be a heterodimer of ATF and c-Jun; c-Jun is not present in the C2 complex. Additional gel shift assays using control extract detected a weaker supershift band with anti-c-Jun antibodies as compared with that seen in OM-treated extract (data not shown), suggesting that OM stimulation may increase the c-Jun DNA-binding activity. Together, these supershift EMSA analyses suggest that 1) C3 is predominantly composed of homodimers and/or heterodimers of members of the CREB family (C3 may also contain a small amount of C/EBPβ); 2) C1 may contain heterodimers between ATF and c-Jun; 3) C4 contains transcription factors that do not appear to belong to the CREB or C/EBP family; and 4) the nature of the C2 complex is presently unknown. C2 may contain a novel factor, as none of the antibodies that recognized most, if not all, transcription factors that could bind to the SIRE sequence significantly affected this complex. To determine the relationship between C/EBPβ binding and promoter activity, we cotransfected HepG2 cells with pLDLR234 and pEF-NFIL6, which encodes NFIL-6, a human homologue of rat C/EBPβ (25.Isshiki H. Akira S. Tanabe O. Nakajima T. Shimamoto T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2757-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 26.Akira S. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1401-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Fig.8 shows that under cholesterol-replete conditions, pEF-NFIL6 increased LDLR promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner. At a low concentration of pEF-NFIL6, the stimulatory effect of OM was diminished, whereas at a higher concentration of pEF-NFIL6 that produced a >10-fold increase in basal promoter activity, OM stimulation was abrogated. We speculate that the loss of response to OM stimulation is through saturation of the binding site (SIRE) on the LDLR promoter construct due to the overexpression of NFIL-6. These results, together with the EMSA data presented in Fig. 7, suggest that the C/EBP site within this promoter region may be a functional cis-acting element that positively regulates LDLR transcription. Takagi and Strauss (13.Takagi T. Strauss J.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1988; 67: 968-973Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have reported that 8-bromo-cAMP increases LDLR mRNA without stimulating LDLR promoter activity. This led to the conclusion that the upstream promoter of the human LDLR gene does not contain a classical CRE. To examine the function of the identified CRE site (−8 to −1) in the regulation of LDLR transcription, HepG2 cells were transfected with the full-length LDLR promoter construct pLDLR234 (−143 to +35) or a reporter containing only the TATA-like element, pLDLR-TATA (−36 to +13) (17.Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig.9 A shows that dibutyryl cAMP by itself is a weak stimulator of LDLR transcription, only increasing the luciferase activity of pLDLR234 by 2-fold without a significant effect on pLDLR-TATA at concentrations up to 5 mm. However, in the presence of OM, luciferase activity was markedly increased up to 8-fold for the full-length promoter and up to 3-fold for the minimal promoter construct in a dibutyryl cAMP dose-dependent manner. This synergistic effect of cAMP and OM depends on the presence of both intact C/EBP and CRE sites, as mutation in either site greatly reduced the synergistic activation of the LDLR promoter (Fig.9 B). These data suggest that interaction of activated CREB through protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation with an OM-activated transcription factor(s) leads to the formation of a more robust transcriptional activator complex. A number of studies have demonstrated the modulated expression of LDLR by nonsterol regulators that are structurally and functionally distinct from cholesterol and its derivatives. In spite of the demonstration that most of these nonsterol mediators such as cytokines and growth factors regulate LDLR expression at the transcriptional level, the molecular mechanisms for sterol-independent regulation are totally unknown, as neither the cis-regulatory elements on the LDLR promoter nor the trans-acting factors that mediate these regulations have been identified. In this study, we identified, for the first time, a SIRE in the human LDLR promoter that is responsive to the cytokine oncostatin M. The OM-responsive element was previously narrowed down to promoter region −52 to +13. This region contains the Sp1-binding site and the two TATA-like sequences. To distinguish Sp1-mediated constitutive promoter activity from OM-stimulated promoter activity, we made single-base mutations across the core Sp1-binding site within the repeat 3 sequence. These mutations revealed that OM activity was diminished when Sp1 binding was abrogated, but was not concurrently lost (Fig. 1). One explanation would be that OM induced a DNA-binding protein to bind this region, and mutations affected this factor differently than Sp1 binding. However, failure of the detection of an OM-induced DNA-binding activity in the repeat 3 sequence excluded this possibility. In searching for additional regulatory elements 3′ of repeat 3, a total of eight mutants that encompass the two TATA-like sequences were constructed and examined for their effects on basal and OM-induced promoter activities. The two mutants TATA1a and TATA1b, which targeted the TATA1 sequence, lowered basal promoter activity to 60–70% of the wild-type level without affecting OM activity, thereby suggesting that this region is not involved in the action of OM, but may contribute to basal promoter activity. We have conducted gel shift assays using a probe containing the TATA1 sequence (−30 to −13) to detect nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells that could bind to the TATA1 sequence. However, no DNA-protein complex was detected (data not shown). Therefore, at present, it is not clear how the TATA1 sequence regulates LDLR transcription. In contrast to the TATA1 mutations, the OM inducibility of LDLR promoter activity was completely abrogated by mutations within TATA2 and its 3′-flanking sequence containing a potential CRE site. Additional mutations downstream from the CRE site did not affect OM activity. Taken together, these eight mutants defined promoter region −17 to −1 as the cis-regulatory element that is responsible for OM-induced activation of LDLR transcription. As revealed by a computer-aided sequence analysis, this promoter region consists of continuous binding sites for C/EBP (−17 to −9) and CREB (−8 to −1). Because this promoter region not only mediated the effect of OM, but also responded to cAMP stimulation (Fig. 9), we designated this promoter region as a SIRE. Next, we were interested to know the relationship between the SIRE and the Sp1-binding site in repeat 3. To determine whether Sp1 binding to repeat 3 is necessary for the SIRE to respond to OM, we replaced repeat 3 in pLDLR-R3 with a GAL4-binding site to create vector pLDLR-GAL4. The basal promoter activity of pLDLR-GAL4 in HepG2 cells that did not express GAL4 or GAL4-Sp1 was very low and did not respond to OM stimulation in a way similar to pLDLR-TATA. OM stimulation was restored equally when the promoter was activated by coexpression of either full-length GAL4 protein or the fusion protein containing the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and the Sp1 activation domain in a manner similar to pLDLR-R3. The mutation in the TATA2 site of pLDLR-GAL4 totally abolished OM stimulation. The same results were obtained with coexpression of GAL4-VP16 fusion protein (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that regulation of LDLR transcription by OM is mediated through the SIRE site. The repeat 3 sequence is dispensable, but a binding site for a strong transcriptional activator in a location proximal to the SIRE is necessary for the SIRE to function as an independent cis-acting element to activate LDLR transcription. To understand the molecular basis of the SIRE, gel shift and supershift assays were performed to characterize the transactivators that interact with this element. In HepG2 nuclear extract without OM treatment, three DNA-protein complexes (C1, C3, and C4) were formed with the TATA1+2 probe, which contains the SIRE site. The C1 and C3 complexes were shown to contain homodimers or heterodimers of members of the CREB and C/EBP families (Fig. 7 A). CREB or C/EBP binds to the SIRE independently, as mutations abolishing the CRE site did not affect C/EBP binding, and conversely, CREB binds the SIRE probe containing a mutation within the C/EBP site (data not shown). In OM-treated HepG2 nuclear extract, in addition to C1, C3, and C4, an additional complex (C2) was formed. We found that binding of the C2 complex to the TATA1+2 probe required the intact C/EBP and CRE sites because mutation in either site eliminated C2 binding to the probe (data not shown). This is in contrast to the independent interaction of CREB and C/EBP with the SIRE sequence. Moreover, induction of C2 by OM depends on ERK activation, as treating cells with OM in the presence of U0126, an inhibitor to the ERK upstream kinase MEK, totally prevented C2 formation without an effect on the other three complexes. Previously, we have shown that U0126 abolished the OM induction of endogenous LDLR mRNA and decreased the OM-stimulated promoter activity of pLDLR-R3 (17.Li C. Kraemer F.B. Ahlborn T.E. Liu J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6747-6753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of U0126 on the C2 complex strongly suggests that the SIRE is a cis-acting element that mediates the extracellular signal transmitted through the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to regulate LDLR transcription. We speculate that the C2 complex contains protein components that are substrates of ERK. The nature of the C2 complex is presently unknown, as gel shift assays with antibodies directed against members of the CREB, C/EBP, and AP-1 families; TATA-binding protein; TAF130; and TAF100 failed to supershift or abolish the C2 complex. These experiments suggest that C2 may contain a novel transcription factor. The identity of the C2 is currently under further investigation. The involvement of AP-1 in LDLR transcription deserves further investigation. In supershift assays, although c-Jun was detected in the C1 complex, pure recombinant c-Jun could not bind to the TATA1+2 probe under similar binding conditions. Interestingly, when recombinant c-Jun was mixed with nuclear extracts prepared from control or OM-treated HepG2 cells, the intensity of C1 was increased, and anti-c-Jun antibodies completely supershifted the C1 complex (data not shown). These data suggest that the c-Jun homodimer is not able to bind to the SIRE, but c-Jun may dimerize with ATF and consequently bind to the SIRE. The relationship between phosphorylation of c-Jun and formation of the OM-induced C2 complex is currently under investigation. In summary, we have identified the SIRE as a novel sterol-independentcis-acting regulatory element in region −17 to −1 of the human LDLR promoter. This element overlaps the previously described TATA-like sequences. It contains contiguous binding sites for the transcription factors C/EBP and CREB. The SIRE is not involved in the classical feedback regulation by cholesterol, but is critically involved in regulations mediated by oncostatin M, cAMP, and C/EBP. We hypothesize that the SIRE acts to integrate different signaling pathways controlling the transcription of the LDLR gene independent of cellular cholesterol. These novel findings provide a molecular basis for the mechanism of sterol-independent regulation of LDLR and link extracellular signaling events to promoter elements on the LDLR gene. This work opens up a new avenue for developing alternative pharmaceutical interventions to lower plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol via a mechanism of action distinct from the classical inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.

Although the mechanism by which the insulin receptor activates extracellular signal-regulated kinases is relatively well defined, the pathway that leads to JNK activation is poorly understood. Overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant (SHP-2C/S) of the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 in Rat-1 fibroblasts that also express human insulin receptors has now revealed that activation of JNKs by insulin and epidermal growth factor, but not that by anisomycin or sorbitol, requires SHP-2. A dominant negative mutant (RasN17) of Ha-Ras blocked insulin-induced JNK activation, whereas a dominant negative mutant (RacN17) of Rac1 or a specific inhibitor (LY294002) of phosphoinositide 3-kinase did not, indicating a role for Ras, but not for Rac or phosphoinositide 3-kinase, in this effect. SHP-2C/S markedly inhibited Ras activation in response to insulin without affecting insulin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates or the dissociation of the Crk-p130Cas complex. In contrast, SHP-2C/S did not inhibit activation of JNKs induced by a constitutively active mutant (RasV12) of Ha-Ras. Furthermore, expression of myristoylated SOS, which functions as a potent activator of Ras, induced JNK activation even when SHP-2 was inactivated. These results suggest that SHP-2 contributes to JNK activation in response to insulin by positively regulating the Ras signaling pathway at the same level as, or upstream from, SOS.

These phosphorylated proteins then bind various Src homology (SH) 2 domain-containing signaling molecules, which in turn propagate the signals that underlie the pleiotropic biological effects of insulin (1.White M.F.

One of the best characterized insulin signaling pathways is that which links the IR to extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), which constitute one class of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The GRB2-SOS complex binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated SHC or IRS1 and then activates Ras by catalyzing the conversion of the inactive, GDP-bound form to the active, GTP-bound form (3.Skolnik E.Y.

Thus, SHP-2 may play a crucial role in intracellular signaling elicited by various hormones and growth factors, probably by contributing to activation of the Ras-ERK pathway. However, the role of SHP-2 in activation of other types of MAPKs has remained unclear. In the present study, we sought to determine whether, and if so how, SHP-2 contributes to the insulin signaling pathway that leads to the activation of JNKs. With the use of a dominant negative mutant of the enzyme, we show that SHP-2 positively regulates this pathway by facilitating the activation of Ras. By transfecting cells with vectors encoding constitutively active forms of Ras and SOS, we also show that this effect of SHP-2 appears to occur at the same level as, or upstream from, SOS. Rat-1 fibroblasts that overexpress human IRs (Rat-1-IR cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The transfection mixture was then supplemented with an equal volume of medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were incubated for 23 h. After replacement of the culture medium with normal growth medium, the cells were then incubated for an additional 24 h. After stimulation, cells (100-mm dishes) were immediately washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the resulting supernatants were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 20 μl of antibody-coupled protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed three times with 1 ml of WG buffer (50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.6), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100), suspended in SDS sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis with the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were performed as described previously (28.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Transfected or nontransfected Rat-1-IR or Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (60-mm dishes) were incubated for 5–20 min with insulin (100 nm) or EGF (100 ng/ml) or for 5 min with sorbitol (400 mm) or anisomycin (10 μg/ml). In some experiments, cells were treated for 30 min with 100 μmLY294002 before insulin treatment. Cells were subsequently lysed in 400 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. Recombinant JNK1 was immunoprecipitated and then subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 10% gel and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the activated forms of JNKs. The activation of endogenous JNKs was assessed by subjecting 20 μg of cellular protein directly to immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the activated forms of JNKs or to total JNK protein. The activity of JNKs was also determined by an in vitro kinase assay with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing amino acids 1–79 of c-Jun as substrate, as described previously (16.Desbois-Mouthon C. Blivet-Van Eggelpoel M.J. Auclair M. Cherqui G. Capeau J. Caron M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 765-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the GST-c-Jun (1–79) fusion protein was detected by immunoblot analysis with antibodies that react specifically with c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser63 and was quantified by scanning densitometry with the NIH image program. The activity of ERKs was assessed essentially under the same conditions as described for determination of JNK activity, with the use of antibodies to the activated forms of ERKs or to total ERK protein. A GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain (amino acids 1–149) of human c-Raf1 (GST-RBD) was expressed in bacteria from the plasmid pGEX-2T-RBD (kindly provided by T. Sato, Tokyo Institute of Technology) and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (20 μg of protein bound to 15 μl of packed beads), as described (33.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Cells in one 100-mm dish were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin for 2 min and then lysed in 600 μl of a solution containing 25 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 25 mm NaF, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), and 1 mm sodium vanadate. The lysates were incubated with the beads for 30 min at 4 °C, and the bound proteins were then eluted from the beads with SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12.5% gel, and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a mAb to Ha-Ras. We have previously shown that a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S) inhibits insulin-induced activation of Ras and ERKs in a dominant negative manner in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human IRs (28.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of this mutant on insulin-induced activation of JNKs, we used Rat-1 fibroblasts that overexpress IRs (Rat-1-IR cells) because insulin was shown to induce marked activation of JNKs in this cell line (15.Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We monitored JNK activation with the use of an in vitro kinase assay in which a GST-c-Jun (1–79) fusion protein serves as substrate, as well as by immunoblot analysis with antibodies that recognize the enzymes only when they are activated by phosphorylation at Thr183 and Tyr185. Given that both assays gave essentially identical results, we mostly present data obtained by immunoblot analysis. Insulin-induced activation of p44 and p42 isoforms of MAPK (ERK1 and ERK2) was almost completely abolished in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig.1 A), verifying that SHP-2C/S acts as a dominant negative mutant in Rat-1-IR cells. Consistent with the results of a previous study (15.Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), insulin induced marked activation of p54 and p46 isoforms of endogenous JNK in Rat-1-IR cells (Fig.1 A), with the maximal effect apparent 15 min after stimulation (data not shown). In contrast, at all time points up to 20 min, the extent of insulin-induced JNK activation in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells was greatly reduced compared with that apparent in Rat-1-IR cells (Fig. 1, A and B; data not shown). The total amounts of JNKs or ERKs in each lane were similar, as revealed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the corresponding enzymes. We transiently transfected Rat-1-IR or Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells with an expression vector encoding HA-tagged JNK1 (HA-JNK). After 48 h, cells were incubated in the absence or presence of insulin, lysed, and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to HA. Immunoblot analysis of the resulting precipitates with antibodies to activated JNK revealed that insulin induced marked activation of HA-JNK in Rat-1-IR cells but that this effect was greatly reduced in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig. 1 C). The presence of similar amounts of immunoprecipitated JNK1 in each lane was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies to HA. Activation of endogenous JNKs by EGF was also markedly attenuated in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells compared with that apparent in Rat-1-IR cells (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, sorbitol-induced osmotic shock activated JNKs in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells to a similar extent as that observed in Rat-1-IR cells (Fig.2). Furthermore, the exent of JNK activation by anisomycin was greater in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells than in Rat-1-IR cells (Fig. 2). These results suggest that functional SHP-2 is required for JNK activation in response to insulin and EGF but not for that in response to cellular stress induced by anisomycin or sorbitol. To clarify the mechanism by which SHP-2 contributes to insulin-induced activation of JNKs, we first investigated which signaling pathway triggered by insulin (PI 3-kinase pathway, Ras pathway, or other pathway) mediates JNK activation. Treatment of Rat-1-IR cells with LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, almost completely blocked insulin-induced activation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase (34.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1828) Google Scholar), as revealed by immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for an activated form of Akt (Fig.3 A). In contrast, this compound did not substantially affect JNK activation in response to insulin (Fig. 3 A). Coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Rac1 (RacN17) also did not affect activation of HA-JNK induced by insulin (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, coexpression of a dominant negative mutant of Ha-Ras (RasN17) markedly inhibited insulin-induced activation of HA-JNK (Fig. 3 B). The expression of both dominant negative mutants was verified by immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies. These results suggest that neither PI 3-kinase nor Rac is required for insulin activation of JNKs, whereas Ras appears to be essential for signaling between activated IRs and JNKs. We next tested the possibility that the negative effect of SHP-2C/S on JNK activation results from inhibition of insulin-induced activation of Ras. Insulin markedly activated Ras in Rat-1-IR cells, as revealed by a precipitation assay with a GST fusion protein containing the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf1 (33.Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the extent of insulin-induced Ras activation was substantially reduced in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells, indicating that functional SHP-2 is required for this effect of insulin (Fig. 4 A). Given that activation of JNKs by insulin depends on Ras, these results suggest that SHP-2 may act at the same level as, or upstream from, Ras to mediate insulin-induced JNK activation. To confirm that SHP-2C/S inhibits insulin-induced activation of Ras in a specific manner, we examined the effects of this mutant on tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events in response to insulin. Insulin induces the tyrosine dephosphorylation of pp125 focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas and thereby disrupts the Crk-p130Cascomplex (35.Pillay T.S. Sasaoka T. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36.Yamauchi K. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 664-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 37.Sorokin A. Reed E. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Tyrosine dephosphorylation of the prominent band at ∼130 kDa, the major components of which might be focal adhesion kinase and p130Cas, as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates such as IRS1, in response to insulin occurred to similar extents in both Rat-1-IR and Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig.4 B, left panel). Furthermore, insulin treatment equally induced the dissociation of the Crk-p130Cas complex in the two cell lines (Fig. 4 B, right panel). These results indicate that inhibition of insulin-induced Ras activation by SHP-2C/S does not result from nonspecific sequestration of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Previous studies have demonstrated that oncogenically activated Ras stimulates JNK activation in several cell lines, including Cos1, HeLa, and NIH 3T3 (5.Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar, 10.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether RasV12, an oncogenically activated form of Ha-Ras, induces JNK activation in Rat-1-IR cells, and, if so, whether SHP-2C/S blocks this effect. As a control, we examined RasV12-induced activation of ERK. Coexpression of RasV12 induced activation of HA-tagged ERK2 (HA-ERK) to the same marked extent in both Rat-1-IR and Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig.5), consistent with previous observations showing that SHP-2 is not required for ERK activation induced by another constitutively active Ras mutant, RasQ61L (38.Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Coexpression of RasV12 also resulted in activation of HA-JNK to the same marked extent in Rat-1-IR and Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig. 5). These results suggest that Ras activation alone is sufficient for activation of JNK in Rat-1-IR cells and that SHP-2 is not required for this effect of activated Ras. To examine further the step at which SHP-2 acts to mediate JNK activation, we investigated the effect of SHP-2C/S on the activation of JNK induced by the catalytic domain of SOS modified by incorporation of the plasma membrane-targeting sequence of Src (myr-SOS), which functions as a potent activator of Ras (39.Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). As a control, we also examined activation of ERK by myr-SOS. Consistent with previous results (38.Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), coexpression of myr-SOS markedly activated HA-ERK in Rat-1-IR cells, and a similar effect was apparent in Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig.6). Coexpression of myr-SOS also induced activation of HA-JNK to the same marked extent in Rat-1-IR and Rat-1-SHP-2C/S cells (Fig. 6). These results suggest that membrane targeting of SOS alone is sufficient for JNK activation in Rat-1-IR cells and that SHP-2 is not required for JNK activation after SOS is activated. With the use of Rat-1 fibroblasts overexpressing IRs as a model system, we have shown that a catalytically inactive mutant of SHP-2 (SHP-2C/S) blocked JNK activation induced by insulin or EGF. In contrast, SHP-2C/S did not inhibit activation of JNK in response to cellular stresses such as anisomycin treatment or sorbitol-induced osmotic shock, consistent with the results of a previous study showing that SHP-2 is not required for stress-induced activation of JNK (40.Shi Z.-Q. Lu W. Feng G.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4904-4908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the requirement for SHP-2 in JNK activation is specific for signaling events elicited by ligands that act at receptor-type tyrosine kinases. However, SHP-2 was shown not to be required for EGF-induced activation of JNK in COS-7 cells (38.Deb T.B. Wong L. Salomon D.S. Zhou G. Dixon J.E. Gutkind J.S. Thompson S.A. Johnson G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16643-16646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reason for this apparent discrepancy with our data is unclear, but it might be attributable to the difference in cell lines studied. The mechanism by which SHP-2 contributes to insulin-induced JNK activation is unknown. However, our results with Rat-1-IR cells suggest a role for Ras in this mechanism. A dominant negative mutant of Ras (RasN17) blocked JNK activation induced by insulin, whereas a constitutively active mutant of Ras (RasV12) markedly induced JNK activation in the absence of insulin stimulation. These results suggest that Ras activation is both necessary and sufficient for JNK activation in response to insulin in Rat-1-IR cells, consistent with the results of previous studies demonstrating the Ras-dependent activation of JNK in response to EGF (9.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 10.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4544-4548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) in other cell types. Insulin-induced activation of Ras, in turn, requires functional SHP-2, as indicated by the observation that SHP-2C/S specifically blocked this effect of insulin. Thus, SHP-2C/S-induced inhibition of JNK activation by insulin likely results, at least in part, from the inhibitory effect of this mutant on Ras activation in response to insulin. Previous studies have shown that PI 3-kinase participates in the JNK signaling pathway initiated by receptor-like tyrosine kinases, including the EGF receptor (42.Logan S.K. Falasca M. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5784-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the platelet-derived growth factor receptor (12.Lopez-Ilasaca M. Li W. Uren A., Yu, J.C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2505-2508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, Rac has been shown to mediate JNK activation induced by EGF (9.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 10.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.X. Abo A.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Moreover, Crk, an adapter protein that contains both SH2 and SH3 domains, mediates EGF-induced JNK activation in a Rac-dependent manner (45.Dolfi F. Garcia-Guzman M. Ojaniemi M. Nakamura H. Matsuda M. Vuori K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15394-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Insulin activates divergent signaling pathways, which include PI 3-kinase and Rac pathways in addition to the Ras pathway (2.Ogawa W. Matozaki T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 46.Marcusohn J. Isakoff S.J. Rose E. Symons M. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, neither a dominant negative mutant of Rac nor a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase, LY294002, affected insulin activation of JNK in Rat-1-IR cells, indicating that neither PI 3-kinase nor Rac is required for the insulin signaling pathway that leads to JNK activation in this cell line. Corkscrew, the Drosophila homolog of SHP-2, was shown to act either upstream (47.Cleghon V. Feldmann P. Ghiglione C. Copeland T.D. Perrimon N. Hughes D.A. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 719-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or downstream (48.Allard J.D. Chang H.C. Herbst R. McNeill H. Simon M.A. Development. 1996; 122: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of Ras1 in signaling by the Torso receptor tyrosine kinase. We have previously demonstrated that SHP-2 regulates an upstream element necessary for Ras activation in response to insulin in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing human IRs (28.Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). SHP-2 has also been shown to act immediately downstream from Ras to mediate ERK activation induced by insulin (49.Sawada T. Milarski K.L. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 737-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, the mode of action, in relation to Ras, of SHP-2 in growth factor signaling has remained unclear. We assumed that if SHP-2 acts downstream from Ras, then SHP-2C/S would block JNK activation induced by constitutive activation of Ras. However, SHP-2C/S did not inhibit the ability of RasV12 to activate JNK, suggesting that the signaling pathway from activated Ras to JNK does not require functional SHP-2 in Rat-1-IR cells. Furthermore, SHP-2C/S did not block JNK activation induced by myr-SOS, which functions as a potent activator of Ras, suggesting that SHP-2 may act at the same level as, or upstream from, SOS to mediate JNK activation in response to insulin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that SHP-2 also acts downstream from Ras in the activation of JNK by insulin in other cell types. Although substantial evidence has established that SHP-2 positively regulates the ERK signaling pathway triggered by various growth factors or integrin-mediated cell adhesion (26.Milarski K.L.

Indeed, SHP-2 regulates both immediate-early and late events required for EGF-induced cell cycle progression (29.Bennett A.M. Hausdorff S.F. O'Reilly A.M. Freeman R.M. Neel B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might play a role in addition to its role in control of the ERK pathway in growth factor-induced signaling. Insulin increases transcription of immediate-early genes regulated by the AP-1 complex, one of the principal components of which is c-Jun, in a Ras-dependent manner (50.Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. Maassen J.A. van de Wetering M.L. van der Eb A.J. McCormick F. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, activation of JNK contributes to insulin-stimulated transcription of AP-1-regulated genes in Rat-1 fibroblasts (15.Miller B.S. Shankavaram U.T. Horney M.J. Gore A.C. Kurtz D.T. Rosenzweig S.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8769-8775Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, JNK is important for AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation and cell growth in response to insulin-like growth factor-1 in IEC-6 intestinal cells (51.Simmons J.G. Hoyt E.C. Westwick J.K. Brenner D.A. Pucilowska J.B. Lund P.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1157-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together with our present data, these observations suggest that SHP-2, by positively regulating Ras-dependent activation of JNKs and ERKs, contributes to AP-1-mediated transcriptional activation in response to insulin, thereby integrating mitogenic signaling by the hormone. However, it is also possible that SHP-2 contributes to other downstream consequences of Ras activation, such as the interaction of Raf1 with Cdc25A, an event required for mitogen-activated cell cycle progression (52.Galaktionov K. Jessus C. Beach D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1046-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). In summary, our results demonstrate that SHP-2 contributes to JNK activation in response to insulin by positively regulating the Ras signaling pathway at the same level as, or upstream from, SOS, thereby possibly promoting cell growth. The SHP-2-mediated signaling pathway that links IRs to JNK activation as well as the physiological significance of this pathway for the biological activities of insulin remain to be characterized.

Zymogen activation to yield 68-kDa LeSBT1 required the additional processing of an amino-terminal autoinhibitory peptide in a strictly pH-dependent manner. Mature 68-kDa LeSBT1 showed highest activity at acidic pH consistent with its presumed localization in the apoplast of the plant cell. In comparison to other plant subtilases, LeSBT1 exhibited a narrower substrate specificity in that it cleaves only polypeptide substrates preferentially but not exclusively carboxyl-terminal of glutamine residues. The possible involvement of LeSBT1 in selective proprotein processing is discussed with reference to the related mammalian proprotein convertases. The cDNA of a tomato subtilase designatedLeSBT1 was cloned from a tomato flower cDNA library. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated for LeSBT1 the structure of a prepro-protein targeted to the secretory pathway by virtue of an amino-terminal signal peptide.

The linear arrangement of the catalytic triad of Asp, His, and Ser residues differs between the primary structures of (chymo)trypsin and subtilisin-related proteases, and these proteases thus have served as a prime example of convergent evolution. More recently, however, subtilases have been discovered also in lower and higher eukaryotes, which further fueled the interest in this clan of serine proteases. Over 200 subtilases are presently known, and they have been grouped into six distinct families, three of which (the bacterial subtilisins, the eukaryotic kexins, and the pyrolysins of diverse origin) will be relevant for the following discussion (1.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). The characterization of the yeast kex2 endoprotease involved in the processing of the α-factor pheromone and of killer toxin paved the way for the discovery of mammalian kexins or proprotein convertases (PCs).1 Presently, seven PCs are known that characteristically cleave the polypeptide precursors of peptide hormones and neuropeptides carboxyl-terminal of paired basic residues (2.Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 3.Steiner D.F. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). In higher plants, there was initially only circumstantial evidence for the existence of kexin-like proteases. In tomato plants, a protein has been identified (SBP50) that specifically interacts with the polypeptide-wound signal molecule systemin. This protein was found to cross-react with an antiserum against aDrosophila PC (4.Schaller A. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11802-11806Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a kex2p-like pathway was shown to exist in tobacco by use of transgenic plants overexpressing the virally encoded antifungal KP6 killer toxin. Correct processing of the protoxin was observed, which required a kex2p-like activity within the secretory pathway of tobacco cells (5.Kinal H. Park C.-M. Berry J.O. Koltin Y. Bruenn J.A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protease was later shown to be a Golgi-resident enzyme with a substrate specificity characteristic of yeast kex2p (6.Jiang L. Rogers J.C. Plant J. 1999; 18: 23-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The first subtilase to be cloned from a higher plant was cucumisin, an extracellular protease highly abundant in melon fruit (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to its primary structure, cucumisin was classified not as a kexin, but rather as a member of the pyrolysin family of subtilases (1.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). Unlike the kexins, cucumisin does not exhibit a preference for substrates with paired basic residues. Its substrate specificity was shown to be broad and similar to that of bacterial subtilisins (8.Kaneda M. Tominaga N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1975; 78: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.Uchikoba T. Yonezawa H. Kaneda M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 117: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and the plant proteases taraxalisin (10.Rudenskaya G.N. Bogacheva A.M. Preusser A. Kuznetsova A.V. Dunaevsky Y.E.

Planta. 1995; 196: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In recent years, genomic and cDNA sequences have been obtained for many plant subtilases from members of genera as diverse as Lilium (12.Taylor A.A. Horsch A. Rzepczyk A. Hasenkampf C.A. Riggs C.D. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) Alnus (13.Ribeiro A. Akkermans A.D.L. van Kammen A. Bisseling T. Pawlowski K.

A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16.Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The proteins derived from these sequences are all related to cucumisin and belong to the pyrolysin family of subtilases, which may suggest that plant subtilases (unlike the kexins) have a broad substrate specificity and serve degradative functions like bacterial subtilisins. The recent discovery of two mammalian pyrolysins indicates that this is not necessarily so. The Site-1 protease (S1P) and the subtilisin/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) exhibit exquisite substrate specificities that markedly differ from that of kexins. They have been implicated in the processing of sterol regulatory element-binding protein transcription factors and pro-brain-derived neurotrophic factor, respectively (19.Sakai J. Rawson R.B.

A. 1999; 96: 1321-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). We are interested in the function of subtilases in plant growth and development and in their possible role in proprotein processing. We have chosen tomato plants as the system to approach these questions, since most of the data on plant subtilases have been obtained in this species. At least 15 subtilases (SBTs) exist in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum, Le), which can be grouped into five distinct subfamilies. Single genes were shown to exist for LeSBT1, LeSBT2, and tmp, while five and six genes were found in the LeSBT3/4 and P69 subfamilies, respectively (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the complexity of the subtilisin family in tomato plants exceeds that of mammalian subtilases. While the tmp protease has been implicated in microspore development (12.Taylor A.A. Horsch A. Rzepczyk A. Hasenkampf C.A. Riggs C.D. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), two proteases of the P69 subfamily (P69B and P69C) are involved in the pathogen defense response (15.Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6332-6337Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 16.Tornero P. Conejero V. Vera P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 2360-2365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The function of LeSBT1, -2, -3/4, and the remaining P69 proteases is still unknown. With the notable exception of LRP, a tomato cell wall protein that is cleaved by one of the pathogen-inducible P69 proteases (21.Tornero P. Mayda E. Gómez M.D. Canas L. Conejero V. Vera P. Plant J. 1996; 10: 315-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the in vivo substrates of tomato subtilases have not been identified yet and, furthermore, none of these enzymes has been characterized biochemically. Clearly, biochemical data are needed to define the roles of these enzymes in plant growth and development. As a first step toward this objective, we describe in the present study the cloning of the LeSBT1 cDNA, the overexpression of the encoded protein in insect cell cultures, the purification of recombinantLeSBT1, and the characterization of its activity. All basic molecular techniques were adapted from Sambrook et al. (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or Ausubelet al. (23.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1987Google Scholar). The PCR-generated probe used for the isolation of the LeSBT1 cDNA has been described and was used previously for the isolation of a genomic clone of LeSBT1 (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, primers were designed corresponding to conserved regions between the catalytic domains of animal proprotein convertases and cucumisin (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were used in PCR reactions with tomato (L. esculentum Mill. cv. Castlemart II) genomic DNA as the template. Reaction products were cloned into Bluescript pSK− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A PCR product exhibiting sequence similarity with subtilases was used for the screening of a tomato flower cDNA library in λZAPII (Stratagene) (24.Bischoff M. Rösler J. Raesecke H.R. Görlach J. Amrhein N. Schmid J. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A total of 4 × 105 phages were screened on duplicate nitrocellulose filters by hybridization to the radiolabeled cDNA probe (Prime-It system; Stratagene) as described (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Three consecutive rounds of screening were performed for plaque purification of 16 positive λ phage clones. Recombinant pBluescript cDNA phagemids were excised in vivo using ExAssist helper phage according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). The clone with the longest cDNA insert designated LeSBT1 was chosen for further analysis. For sequence analysis, nested deletions were generated from the 5′end of the cDNA using exonuclease III and SI nuclease according to standard protocols (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Reaction products were treated with the Klenow fragment of Escherichia coliDNA polymerase I, gel-purified, and cloned into pSK−. The coding strand of the cDNA inserts of the resulting plasmids were sequenced using fluorescent dideoxy chain terminators in the cycle sequencing reaction (Perkin-Elmer) and the Applied Biosystems model 373A DNA sequencer. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland) based on the obtained sequence information to facilitate the sequencing of the second strand of the LeSBT1 cDNA. Sequence data were compiled and analyzed using the University of Wisconsin GCG sequence analysis software package (25.Genetics Computer Group (1994) Program Manual for the Wisconsin Package, Version 8.0, Madison, WIGoogle Scholar). Different organs of tomato plants were ground in liquid nitrogen, and the powder was subjected to RNA extraction using a phenol-based extraction procedure (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Five μg of total RNA were separated on formaldehyde agarose gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and hybridized to the radiolabeledLeSBT1 cDNA using standard laboratory procedures (22.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of the filters was performed under conditions that did not allow cross-hybridization of the LeSBT1 probe with other members of the subtilase family in tomato (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The 870-base pairMunI fragment of the LeSBT1 cDNA coding for amino acids 471–760 of the LeSBT1 protein was cloned into the EcoRI site of pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Zürich, Switzerland) to generate pGEX-SBT1. pGEX-SBT1 was transformed into E. coli DH5, and its identity was confirmed by sequence analysis. A 100-ml culture was grown from a single transformant to a OD600 of 0.9, and expression of theLeSBT1 fragment in fusion with glutathioneS-transferase (GST) was induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After 3 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation. The GST-LeSBT1 fusion protein was found to be insoluble in E. coli, and it accumulated in inclusion bodies, which were purified from bacterial extracts as described (26.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The fusion protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE (10% gels, buffer system as described by Laemmli (Ref. 27.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206261) Google Scholar)) and the gel slice containing GST-LeSBT1 was used to raise a polyclonal antiserum (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Homogenized gel slices containing approximately 100 μg and 50 μg of fusion protein were used for the first and the three consecutive injections, respectively. Serum was sampled 2 weeks after the fourth injection. The serum was diluted 1:1000 to be used on Western blots in combination with a goat anti-rabbit IgG/alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad; diluted 1:3000). Spodoptera frugiperda cells (IPLB-SF21, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) were maintained in 15-ml monolayer cultures at 28 °C in Grace's insect medium (Life Technologies AG, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies AG), 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 units/ml penicillin. Cells (2 × 106) were transferred to fresh medium once a week. For overexpression experiments, Sf21 cells were maintained in 100-ml suspension cultures in serum-free medium (Sf-900 supplemented basal powdered medium, Life Technologies AG) containing 12.5 units/ml penicillin, 12.5 units/ml streptomycin, and 0.1% (w/v) Pluronic F68 at 28 °C at 140 rpm. Cells (5 × 107) were transferred to fresh medium once a week. The open reading frame of the LeSBT1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Stoffel-fragment, Perkin-Elmer). Thirty cycles of amplification (95 °C/45 s; 60 °C/45 s; 74 °C/5 min) were performed in a thermal cycler (Cetus, Perkin-Elmer). The 5′-primer (GGGGATCCCATAAAGATGGAAAGACTCAGG) and the 3′-primer (GGTCTAGAAGAATCATGTCCAGCTGAAAGC) comprisedBamHI and XbaI restriction sites, respectively, to facilitate the cloning of the PCR product into the transfer vector pBacPAK8 (CLONTECH) downstream of the viral polyhedrin promoter to generate pBP-SBT1. Sequence analysis of pBP-SBT1 revealed the presence of two misincorporated nucleotides, both of which were found to be contained in a PmlI/XbaI fragment of pBP-SBT1. To eliminate the misincorporated nucleotides, this fragment was replaced with the corresponding fragment of the original LeSBT1 cDNA. Recombinant baculovirus (Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) was generated by homologous recombinantion during co-transfection ofSf21 cells with pBP-SBT1 and linearized viral DNA (BacPAK6 baculovirus expression system, CLONTECH) according to the vendor's instructions. After 4 days at 28 °C, the culture supernatant was harvested and screened for viable virus by plaque assay (28.King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, New York1992Crossref Google Scholar). Individual viral plaques were isolated and used to infect insect cell cultures, which were subsequently tested for the expression ofLeSBT1 by SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis. Three monoclonal cultures out of five expressed recombinant LeSBT1. One of the recombinant viruses was chosen and amplified in subsequent cultures of 3, 15, and 30 ml (monolayers) and 50, 100, and 400 ml (cell suspensions) of serum-free medium according to standard protocols (28.King L.A. Possee R.D. The Baculovirus Expression System: A Laboratory Guide. Chapman and Hall, New York1992Crossref Google Scholar). The resulting 380 ml of high titer virus stock contained 8 × 107 plaque-forming units/ml. Sf21 cells (4 × 108) were collected by centrifugation (200 × g), resuspended in 400 ml of fresh serum-free culture medium, and infected with 2 × 109(multiplicity of infection of 5) recombinant virus particles from the high-titer virus stock (cf. previous paragraph). After 72 h of incubation, the culture was chilled to 4 °C, and the culture supernatant was separated from cells and membrane fragments by centrifugation. The 100,000 × g supernatant was subjected to a fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation from 50% to 90% saturation. The precipitate was desalted and transferred to buffer A (50 mm MES/sodium acetate, pH 5.8) using a HighTrap desalting column on the Äkta Explorer chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All chromatographic steps were performed at room temperature. The protein sample was subjected to cation exchange chromatography on Resource S (1 ml column volume, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A. Protein was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0–75 mm in 10 ml buffer A). Pooled fractions were subjected to final anion exchange chromatography on MonoQ (1-ml column volume, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm BisTris/Tris pH 7.0 (buffer B). A linear NaCl gradient (0–300 mm in 24 ml of buffer B) was used for elution of bound protein. Since no convenient assay forLeSBT1 activity was available, SDS-PAGE/Western blot analysis using the LeSBT1 antiserum (1:1000) and a goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:3000; Bio-Rad) as the primary and secondary antibodies was used throughout the purification procedure to assay fractions for the presence of LeSBT1 protein. The activity of LeSBT1 was routinely assayed with glucagon as the substrate. Processing of glucagon was followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis of the peptide fragments generated. In standard assays, the reaction was performed in a total volume of 1 μl of reaction buffer (25 mm MES/acetate pH 6.0, 2 mmCaCl2) on the MALDI sample plate. Unless otherwise indicated, the substrate (50 μm) was used in a 200-fold molar excess over the protease (250 nm) and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 or 15 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by addition of 0.5 μl 0.5% (w/v) trifluoroacetic acid, and the solution was mixed with 3 μl of the crystallization matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxy-trans-cinnamic acid, prepared according to Beavis et al. (Ref. 29.Beavis R.C. Chaudhary T. Chait B.T. Organic Mass Spectrom. 1992; 27: 156-158Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar)), and mass spectra were recorded with a Voyager Elite mass spectrometer using the reflectron mode for increased mass accuracy. Peptide masses were further analyzed using the program PAWS version 8.1.1 (freeware edition for MacOs 7.5, copyright ProteoMetrics, 1997). For time course experiments, the reaction was performed in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, and aliquots were taken at the appropriate reaction time, quenched, and analyzed as before. The screening of a tomato flower cDNA library (4 × 105 plaque-forming units) with a PCR-generated probe for tomato subtilases resulted in the isolation of 16 positive λ phage clones. Partial sequence analysis revealed that seven of the cDNA clones had sequences similar to subtilisin-related proteases. The longest cDNA was chosen for further analysis. Both strands of the 2689-base pair cDNA (accession no. X98929) were sequenced, and the cDNA was found to be derived from the LeSBT1 gene described previously (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). TheLeSBT1 cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2298 base pairs (nucleotides 140–2437) with the capacity to code for theLeSBT1 protein of 766 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 A) exhibits strong similarity to subtilases from tomato and other plant species (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,12.Taylor A.A. Horsch A. Rzepczyk A. Hasenkampf C.A. Riggs C.D.

Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the conceptual translation indicates thatLeSBT1 is synthesized as a preproprotein. Computer analysis (SignalP version 1.1) predicts a 23-amino acid signal peptide for secretion at the amino terminus. Additional targeting signals for subcellular compartments were not detected, consistent with the possibility that LeSBT1 is an extracellular protease. Subtilases typically comprise a prodomain, which assists in the folding of the protease and serves as an intramolecular inhibitor of enzymatic activity (1.Siezen R.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 501-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar, 30.Baker D. Shiau A.K. Agard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For cucumisin (7.Yamagata H. Masuzawa T. Nagaoka Y. Ohnishi T. Iwasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32725-32731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), P69 (31.Fischer W. Christ U. Baumgartner M. Erismann K.H. Mösinger E. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1989; 35: 67-83Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the lily subtilase lim9 (12.Taylor A.A. Horsch A. Rzepczyk A. Hasenkampf C.A. Riggs C.D. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1261-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), the NH2 termini of the mature enzymes have been determined and were found to be well conserved, beginning with an invariable pair of threonine residues. This sequence motif is also found in LeSBT1 (Fig. 1 A), suggesting thatLeSBT1 is a preproprotein comprising a 23-amino acid NH2-terminal signal peptide, a prodomain of 82 amino acids, and a catalytic domain in which the amino acids of the catalytic triad (Asp139, His212, Ser542), as well as the stabilizing Asn314, are conserved (Fig.1 B). The LeSBT1 sequence contained a single consensus site (Asn-X-(Ser/Thr)) for potentialN-linked glycosylation (Asn376, cf. Fig. 1 A). In insect cell-expressed LeSBT1, however, we failed to detect any protein bound sugar residues using the DIG glycan detection kit (Roche Diagnostics; data not shown). Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 C) revealed the presence of a single class of transcripts for LeSBT1 in roots, stems, and flowers of tomato plants. The transcript was hardly detectable in cotyledons, leaves, and suspension-cultured cells. A recombinant baculovirus (A. californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus) was generated carrying the open reading frame of the LeSBT1 cDNA under control of the polyhedrin promoter, which is active in the late phase of viral infection. The time dependence ofLeSBT1 expression was analyzed in Sf21 cell monolayer cultures (Fig. 2). Two forms of the recombinant LeSBT1 protein, which differed in their apparent molecular masses, were found to accumulate within the cells and in the culture supernatant, respectively. The intracellular form with an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa first appeared 48 h after infection and was found to be insoluble. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was determined (RQNQKKTY, indicated in Fig. 1 A) and was found to correspond to the LeSBT1 proprotein, lacking the predicted 23-amino acid signal peptide. The less abundant secreted form ofLeSBT1 with an apparent molecular mass of 73 kDa was first detectable in the culture medium at 36 h after viral infection, and highest levels were observed after 72 h. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this polypeptide (TTRSPTFL, indicated in Fig. 1 A) corresponded to the amino terminus of the catalytic domain, which appears to be well conserved in plant subtilases (18.Meichtry J. Amrhein N. Schaller A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For purification of the extracellular form ofLeSBT1, Sf21 suspension cell cultures in serum-free medium were infected with the recombinant baculovirus and the medium was collected 72 h after infection. The purification procedure involved fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by cation and anion exchange chromatography. The progress of purification resulting in a homogeneous preparation ofLeSBT1 is shown in Fig. 3. One liter of cell culture yielded 1.3 - 1.7 mg of the pure 73-kDa form ofLeSBT1.Figure 3Purification of 73-kDaLeSBT1 from Sf21 cell suspension cultures. A Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel is shown. The medium of Sf21 cell suspension cultures (600 ml) was harvested 72 h after infection. Proteins in the 100,000 × g supernatant (lane 1, 20 μg) were subjected to fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation (50–90% saturation; lane 2, 20 μg). After desalting, the proteins were further separated by cation and anion exchange chromatography. Lanes 3 and 4 were loaded with 1 μg of the pooled protein fractions obtained after chromatography on ResourceS and MonoQ, respectively. The protein samples in lanes 1–4 represent 1/3000, 1/1200, 1/1500, and 1/1000 of the total protein in the respective fraction. Protein molecular weight standards (Amersh"
https://openalex.org/W1988220127,"Two forms of glutamic-acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been identified in mammalian tissues: a 65-kDa form (GAD65) and a 67-kDa form (GAD67). Alternate splicing produces one or two smaller variants of GAD67 in the brain of embryonic mice and rats. Additionally, a short, heretofore unidentified transcript homologous to GAD67 has been detected in human testis RNA. Because GAD, the enzyme responsible for γ-aminobutyric acid production and a key autoantigen in type I diabetes, has unclear function in non-neural tissue, it is important to understand its pattern of expression. Unlike GAD65, GAD67 is not produced in human pancreatic islets. Here, we describe a novel splice variant of GAD67 that is produced in human islets, testis, adrenal cortex, and perhaps other endocrine tissues, but not in brain. This transcript directs the synthesis of a protein without GAD enzymatic activity: GAD25. A unique peptide sequence at the carboxyl terminus of GAD25 is highly conserved between mice, rats, and humans. We conclude that humans produce a third form of GAD in non-neural tissues and that human islets, although they do not synthesize full-length GAD67, do express this shortened variant."

All mutants were expressed at lower concentrations than wt apoA-I in plasma of fasting apoA-I-deficient mice. The Δ5-6A-I mutant was found primarily in the lipid-poor high density lipoprotein (HDL) pool and at lower concentrations than Δ4-5A-I and Δ6-7A-I that formed more buoyant HDL2/3particles. At an elevated adenovirus dose and earlier blood sampling from fed mice, both Δ5-6A-I and Δ6-7A-I increased HDL-free cholesterol and phospholipid but not cholesteryl ester. In contrast, wt apoA-I and Δ4-5A-I produced significant increases in HDL cholesteryl ester. Further analysis showed that Δ6-7A-I and native apoA-I could bind similar amounts of phospholipid and cholesterol that were reduced slightly for Δ5-6A-I and greatly for Δ4-5A-I. We conclude from these findings that amino acids (aa) 100–143, specifically helix 4 (aa 100–121), contributes to the maturation of HDL through a role in lipid binding and that the downstream sequence (aa 144–186) centered around helix 6 (aa 144–165) is responsible for the activation of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase.

This is accomplished through the ability of apoA-I to promote the removal of cholesterol and phospholipids from cells and subsequently activate the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (4.Fielding C.J.

Domains of apoA-I required for lipid association and the activation of LCAT have been the focus of many in vitro investigations. The initial binding of apoA-I to lipids is thought to occur via the extreme N-terminal (aa 44–64) and C-terminal (aa 220–243) amphipathic α-helices that may or may not require additional interactions with other regions of the protein (7.Palgunachari M.N.

We have previously generated a series of mutants in which a pair of adjacent helices were deleted sequentially within the central domain of apoA-I (20.Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Emmanuel F. Latta M.

These mutants denoted here as Δ4-5A-I, Δ5-6A-I, and Δ6-7A-I contain deletions in which amino acids 100–143, 122–165, and 144–186 have been removed, respectively. Our rationale in choosing these deletions was that removing a pair of helices would minimally modify the periodicity of the amphipathic α-helices and their putative interactions. Subsequent characterization of these mutantsin vitro confirmed that the amphipathic α-helices within residues 100–186 were involved in interactions with phospholipids and may contribute to the overall lipid binding capacity of the apoA-I in the formation of HDL (21.Frank P.G. Bergeron J. Emmanuel F. Lavigne J.P. Sparks D.L. Denèfle P. Rassart E. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1798-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Removal of helices 4 and 5 (aa 100–143) caused a slight decrease in LCAT activation in vitro,whereas deletion of either helices 5 and 6 (aa 122–165) or 6 and 7 (aa 144–186) almost abolished cholesterol esterification (18.Frank P.G.

This finding is in agreement with previous work suggesting that helix 6 (aa 144–165) is necessary for optimum LCAT activation (17.Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W.

Despite the insights gained from these in vitro studies, the roles of apoA-I central domain amphipathic α-helices in HDL maturationin vivo are still not fully understood. In this study, we generated recombinant adenoviruses containing cDNAs for human wild-type apoA-I (wt apoA-I) and the three central domain deletion mutants for the purpose of structure/function analysis of apoA-I in vivo. Native apoA-I and the mutants were analyzed following injections of the recombinant adenoviruses into apoA-I-deficient mice. These studies demonstrate that specific amphipathic α-helices within the central domain of apoA-I contribute to the in vivo maturation of HDL through roles in either lipid binding or the activation of LCAT. The cDNAs for firefly luciferase (luc), wt apoA-I, Δ4-5A-I, Δ5-6A-I, and Δ6-7A-I were subcloned into the vector pCA13 under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Microbix Biosystems Inc., Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Recombinant adenovirus (Ad5) constructs carrying these cDNAs were prepared following co-transfection of 293 cells (Microbix Biosystems Inc.) with the plasmid pJM17 and the appropriate pCA13 plasmid. LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used as the transfection reagent. After an 8-h incubation with the transfection mixture in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), the 293 cells were incubated overnight with Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and then overlaid with 0.65% SeaPlaque agar (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME) in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing fetal bovine serum (5%), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin sulfate (100 μg/ml). Plaques were picked (1–2 weeks later) from the agar and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 137 mm NaCl, 8.2 mmNa2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl) containing CaCl2 (0.68 mm), MgCl2 (0.50 mm) (PBS2+), and glycerol (10%). These plaques were used to infect subsequent confluent monolayers of 293 cells in order to amplify the recombinant adenoviruses. Polymerase chain reaction of DNA prepared from SDS- (0.5%) and Pronase (0.05%)-lysed 293 cells infected with the appropriate Ad5 construct was performed to detect the apoA-I cDNAs or luciferase cDNA (luc). All adenoviruses were subjected to several rounds of amplification prior to a final purification on two successive CsCl gradients. The purified virus stocks were dialyzed extensively against PBS2+ containing 10% glycerol and aliquoted through sterile 0.22-μm filters (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA), and plaque-forming units (pfu) per ml were determined by incubating fresh monolayers of 293 cells (60-mm dishes) with the appropriate dilution (usually 10−9) of adenovirus stock. ApoA-I-deficient (Apoa1 tm1Unc) C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were maintained on a 12-h light/12-h dark schedule on a normal chow diet (Charles River Rodent Animal Diet, catalog number 5075–18% protein, 4.5% fat). All experiments performed were in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Ottawa Animal Care Committee. All mice used, unless otherwise indicated, were 3–10-month-old females. Lipid measurements were performed on the plasma of fasted (9–11 h) and non-fasted mice (fed state). Briefly, blood was collected into EDTA(K3) microcapillary tubes (Sarstedt Inc., St-Leonard, Québec, Canada) following clipping of the tail vein, and plasma was subsequently isolated by centrifugation (5 min at 4000 × g). Total (TC) and free (FC) cholesterol levels were measured with enzymatic kits (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as was phospholipid (PL) (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany) using freshly isolated plasma samples. Cholesteryl ester levels were determined by subtracting FC from TC. These values were used for pre-adenovirus injection lipid levels. Mice were allowed to recover at least 2 days prior to the injection of the recombinant adenoviruses. All adenoviruses were injected into the tail vein at a dosage of either 2 × 109 or 1 × 1010 pfu. To monitor the efficiency of each tail vein injection, 2 × 107 pfu of luc.Ad5 were included in the injections of the Ad5 carrying the apoA-I cDNAs. Mice were either fasted prior to blood collection 96 h post-adenovirus injection or alternatively blood was taken from fed mice (on the chow diet) 40 h postinjection. Mice were anesthetized, and blood was collected into EDTA(K3) vacutainer tubes following a laparotomy and subsequent clipping of the descending aorta. The liver was removed, weighed (typically 1–1.3 g wet weight), and homogenized on ice in luciferase lysis buffer (1 ml). Luciferase activity was measured in a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG 38 G Berthold) following addition of 10 μl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Plasma was isolated by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 13 min, and TC, FC, CE, and PL levels were determined as described earlier. Plasma (1.5 μl) isolated from fasted mice prior to injection or following injection of luc.Ad5, Δ4-5A-I.Ad5, or Δ5-6A-I.Ad5 (2 × 109 pfu of each) was subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, the membrane was probed with a polyclonal anti-mouse apolipoprotein E (apoE) antibody (BIODESIGN International, Kennebunk, ME) and visualized by chemiluminescence (West Pico SuperSignal substrate, Pierce) after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The relative intensities of the apoE signals were determined with software from Bio-Rad (Quantity One, version 4.10). Plasma (500 μl) isolated following the different Ad5 injections (96 h) was loaded on two Superdex 200 columns (analytical grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) connected in series with a total bed volume of approximately 400 ml and void volume of 100 ml. The columns were standardized with a mixture of high and low molecular weight markers of known Stokes' diameters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Plasma was passed down the columns at a flow rate of 0.1 ml per min, and 5-ml fractions were collected. The VLDL and low density lipoprotein component of the plasma appeared in the void volume (fractions 9–12) on these columns. Large size HDL2 particles were localized in fractions 15–19 (12.1 to 10.2 nm), larger HDL3particles in fractions 20–23 (9.7 to 8.2 nm), and smaller HDL fractions containing albumin were in fractions 24–28. Total cholesterol was determined for the various fractions. Briefly, samples were concentrated (5-fold by lyophilization) and resuspended in PBS, and cholesterol levels were quantified by standard enzymatic kits as described. Aliquots (100 μl) from each fraction were analyzed for apoA-I by slot blot (Bio-Rad Bio-Dot SF unit) analysis. The nitrocellulose was probed with biotinylated monoclonal antibodies directed against apoA-I (a combination of 4H1 (against the extreme N terminus) and 5F6 (against the central region)). The antibodies were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce). The presence of the apoA-I proteins in each of the FPLC Superdex 200 fractions was detected by chemiluminescence (Pierce SuperSignal substrate) following treatment with streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). No background signal could be detected as indicated by analysis of plasma fractions isolated following luc.Ad5 injections. Lipid levels (TC, FC, CE, and PL) in the HDL2/HDL3 FPLC fractions were measured as described earlier. The concentrations of the different apoA-I variants in the plasma of apoA-I-deficient mice were determined by a solid-phase radioimmunoassay as described previously (12.Calabresi L. Meng Q.-H. Castro G.R. Marcel Y.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6477-6484Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 24.Calabresi L. Banfi C. Sirtori C.R. Franceschini G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Lipids Lipid Metab. 1992; 1124: 195-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). ApoA-I-deficient mouse plasma was included with human apoA-I in generation of the standard curve to account for any cross-reactivity between the monoclonal antibodies and potential antigens in the plasma. No cross-reaction was detected. Plasma samples isolated following the Ad5 injections were subjected to discontinuous gradient density ultracentrifugation. Briefly, each sample (0.5 to 1.0 ml) was brought to a final volume of 3 ml (1 mm EDTA) with the addition of potassium bromide (1 g of KBr) and sucrose (50 mg). The discontinuous gradient consisted of plasma (3 ml on bottom) layered successively with ρ = 1.21 g/ml KBr (2 ml), ρ = 1.08 g/ml KBr (3 ml), and ρ = 1.00 g/ml (3 ml top). The tubes were spun for 18 h at 35,000 rpm on a Beckman L8–70M ultracentrifuge at 8 °C, and fractions (1 ml) were collected from top to bottom. The densities of the fractions were determined by comparing the readings measured with a refractometer (Fisher) to values obtained for solutions with known densities. Aliquots of each of the fractions were dialyzed against PBS (0.025 μm filter disks, Millipore Corp.), placed in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were either stained for protein (GELCODE Blue Stain, Pierce) or transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis probing for either the human apoA-I proteins or mouse apoE. The concentrations of the apoA-I proteins (wild-type and mutant) in the different lipoprotein fractions from very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) to lipid-poor HDL species were measured by radioimmunoassay as described. The discontinuous gradient density fractions were subjected to non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis followed by Western blot analysis to size the HDL species formed by wt apoA-I or the central domain deletion mutants. The samples were dialyzed against PBS before application to the gels. The gradient gels were run for 2200 V-h and included high molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that were biotinylated with Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (Pierce). The gels were transferred at 4 °C for 4 h with one change of transfer buffer. The nitrocellulose membranes were probed with biotinylated anti-apoA-I antibodies 4H1 and 5F6 followed by treatment with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and detection with the Pierce West Pico SuperSignal substrate as described. HDL fractions were analyzed for their morphology by negative staining electron microscopy as described previously (25.Forte T.M. Nordhausen R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The HDL were concentrated to 100–200 μg/ml as determined by the Markwell Lowry method (26.Markwell M.A. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5346) Google Scholar) and mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 2% sodium phosphotungstate, pH 7.4 (previously filtered through 0.22-μm membrane), before applying (10 μl) to carbon-coated Formvar grids (200 mesh). After 30 s on the grid, the samples were dried and analyzed in a Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope at × 50,000 or × 70,000 magnification. Cholesterol esterification rates of plasma samples from apoA-I-deficient mice expressing wt apoA-I or Δ4-5A-I were analyzed as described (27.Dobiasova M. Stribrna J. Sparks D.L. Pritchard P.H. Frohlich J.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1991; 11: 64-70Crossref Scopus (81) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The apoA-I-deficient plasma samples (30 μl) containing no apoA-I (luc.Ad5-injected mice), wt apoA-I (10 μg), or Δ4-5A-I (10 μg) were diluted in PBS (final volume 250 μl) and incubated with [3H]cholesterol on filter disks (5 μCi of [3H]FC) at 4 °C overnight. Two aliquots (50 μl each) were removed and used as the time 0 point, and 2 aliquots were placed at 37 °C for 30 min. Ethanol (1 ml) was added (2 h room temperature incubation) to the time 0 and 30-min samples. The supernatant collected following centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g) was incubated with hexane carrier (3 ml containing 50 μg/ml CE and 100 μg/ml FC) and then evaporated to dryness under N2. The samples were solubilized in chloroform (200 μl), spotted (50 μl) on thin layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Silica Glass Fiber-Gelman Science, Ann Arbor, MI), run in a hydrophobic solvent system (89% hexane, 10% diethyl ether, and 1% acetic acid), and FC and CE were visualized with iodine staining. Bands corresponding to FC and CE were cut, and radioactivity was determined. The fractional cholesterol esterification rate is expressed as the percentage of FC converted to CE per h. We first established that wt apoA-I reached physiological levels (170 ± 40 mg/dl) in the plasma of fasted apoA-I-deficient mice 96 h post-Ad5 injection at a dose of 2 × 109 pfu. Under the same conditions, all apoA-I mutants were expressed at significantly lower levels. The highest expression was observed for Δ4-5A-I, followed by Δ6-7A-I, and lowest for Δ5-6A-I. No impairment in secretion rates of the apoA-I central domain deletion mutants were detected following infection of COS-7 cells in culture (>95% of all apoA-I forms were secreted in the media as measured by Western blot analysis 3 days postinfection, data not shown). This suggests that all apoA-I mutants are folded normally and secreted equally. When we increased the Ad5 doses and analyzed plasma in the fed state at earlier times postinjection (within 40 h), the levels of the apoA-I mutants obtained were similar to or greater than those found for wt apoA-I (Table I, 40-h fed column). The time course of expression showed that all mutants had early peak levels that decreased markedly by day 6 postinjection, whereas wt apoA-I reached a peak concentration 10 days postinjection and remained circulating for over 30 days (Fig.1).Table IThe protein concentrations of native human apoA-I and the three mutants in the plasma of apoA-I-deficient miceAd5 constructApoA-I levels96-H fasted (n)40-H fed (n)mg/dlLuciferase0.32 ± 0.22 (2)NDcND, not determined.wt apoA-I172 ± 43 (4)aAdenovirus dose = 2 × 109 pfu.178 ± 130 (3)aAdenovirus dose = 2 × 109 pfu.Δ4-5A-I27 ± 6 (4)aAdenovirus dose = 2 × 109 pfu.643 ± 206 (3)bAdenovirus dose = 1 × 1010 pfu.Δ5-6A-I3.6 ± 2.3 (7)aAdenovirus dose = 2 × 109 pfu.405 ± 230 (3)bAdenovirus dose = 1 × 1010 pfu.Δ6-7A-I9.3 ± 4.2 (3)aAdenovirus dose = 2 × 109 pfu.198 ± 90 (4)bAdenovirus dose = 1 × 1010 pfu.Each Ad5 construct was administered via the tail vein of apoA-I-deficient mice at either one of the two doses as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The number (n) of mice used for each mutant and either treatment is indicated.

Expression of the apoA-I mutants in plasma taken from fasted apoA-I-deficient mice (96 h postinjection) was not accompanied by any increase in plasma lipid levels but rather by moderate decreases (Table II). In contrast, wt apoA-I produced significant increases in plasma cholesterol and phospholipids. This increase in plasma cholesterol was due exclusively to an increase in the HDL-CE concentration. The control luc.Ad5-injected mice had slightly decreased lipid levels compared with non-injected mice, but this did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, the decrease in plasma lipid levels following expression of the apoA-I mutants, and in particular Δ5-6A-I (Table II), was significant (p < 0.05) and not explained by an effect of the adenovirus vector alone.Table IIFasted plasma lipid levels and the ratio of esterified to total cholesterol in apoA-I-deficient mice prior to or following injections of either luciferase or the various apoA-I recombinant adenovirus constructsAd5 injectionaAll adenovirus constructs were injected at a final titer of 2 × 109 p/fu.

Open table in a new tab We tested the possibility that the reduced concentration of lipids in plasma of apoA-I-deficient mice following expression of the apoA-I mutants was correlated with decreases in the concentrations of other apolipoproteins normally found in these mice.

The mutant α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa proteins were found to be retained and degraded in cells stably expressing these mutant forms of α2PI. Degradation of the two mutant α2PI proteins, mediated by proteasomes, occurred after a lag time of 1.5 h during which glucose trimming took place. The mutant α2PI proteins were not ubiquitinated. Inhibition of mannosidase activity blocked the degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins without resulting in any changes in their binding to calnexin. Inhibition of glucose removal completely blocked the interaction between the α2PI proteins and the molecular chaperone calnexin. Under these conditions, mannose residues were removed from the oligosaccharides even when glucose residues were not processed. With mannose removal, the glucose-untrimmed mutant forms of α2PI, which failed to bind to calnexin, were degraded by proteasomes. The initiation of mannose trimming was a prerequisite for their degradation.

Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5956-5965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). α2PI belongs to the serine protease inhibitor superfamily. It is able to inhibit several different serine proteases, but its main function is to inhibit plasma-mediated fibrinolysis (2.Aoki N. Moroi M. Matsuda M. Tachiya K. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3.Aoki N. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1979; 21: 267-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 4.Hirosawa S. Nakamura Y. Miura O. Sumi Y. Aoki N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6836-6840Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The physiological importance of α2PI was established by the discovery of individuals with congenital α2PI deficiency in whom hemostatic plugs are dissolved prematurely before the restoration of injured vessels, resulting in a severe hemorrhagic tendency (5.Aoki N. Saito H. Kamiya T. Koie K. Sakata Y. Kobakura M. J. Clin. Invest. 1979; 63: 877-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 6.Aoki N. Sakata Y. Matsuda M. Tateno K. Blood. 1980; 55: 483-488Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic abnormalities of α2PI have been well characterized at the molecular level in two Japanese familial cases affected with the deficiency (7.Miura O. Hirosawa S. Kato A. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 8.Miura O. Sugahara Y. Nakamura Y. Hirosawa S. Aoki N.

One familial case of congenital α2PI deficiency, designated as α2PI-Nara, involves a frameshift mutation that results in the substitution of 178 amino acid residues for 12 carboxyl-terminal amino acid residues of the wild-type α2PI (7.Miura O. Hirosawa S. Kato A. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The other case, designated as α2PI-Okinawa, involves a trinucleotide deletion that gives rise to the deletion of Glu-137 (9.Miura O. Sugahara Y. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18213-18219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10.Toyota S. Hirosawa S. Aoki N. J. Biochem. 1994; 115: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The mutant molecules of α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa, which were expressed transiently in COS-7 cells, were retained for a prolonged period as endoglycosidase H (Endo H)-sensitive forms, and in each instance only a small proportion of the expressed proteins was secreted. Retention within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been reported for several other naturally occurring or genetically engineered mutant proteins that do not fold correctly. It has been shown that newly made secretory or membrane proteins do not move from the rough ER to the Golgi apparatus unless they fold into a native or near-native conformation (11.Lippincott S.J. Bonifacino J.S. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1988; 54: 209-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Misfolded proteins do not accumulate in the ER and are eventually removed from the ER by proteolysis. This rapid and selective degradation of proteins that are unable to reach the Golgi apparatus has been described as ER or pre-Golgi degradation. The process called ER degradation was generally assumed to occur inside the ER or a pre-Golgi compartment (12.Bonifacino J.S. Lippincott S.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 592-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 13.Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). However, the proteases present in the ER have not yet been identified. Several recent reports have suggested a role for the proteasome in the ER degradation of some membrane or luminal proteins (14.Bonifacino J.S. Nature. 1996; 384: 405-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 15.Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). For example, misfolded cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator molecules are rapidly degraded in a process that requires covalent modification with ubiquitin and that is blocked by lactacystin, a specific proteasome inhibitor (16.Omura S.

Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), and major histocompatibility class I heavy chains have also recently been shown to require proteasome activity (20.Michalek M.T.

Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). Several ER-resident proteins that function as molecular chaperones have a role in ER quality control and contribute to the retention of misfolded proteins (23.Helenius A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin preferentially interact with the nascent one-glucose-attached forms ofN-linked oligosaccharides after glucose trimming and are thought to select proteins for degradation or secretion pathways. Their substrate-binding function is linked to a number of diseases with an ER-storage phenotype, such as cystic fibrosis, familial hypercholesterolemia, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency (24.Hammond C. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 528-529Crossref Scopus (589) Google Scholar,25.Williams D.B. Watts T.H. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In these disease states, they serve as a part of the machinery that retains the misfolded glycoproteins in the ER. However, the selective mechanism that directs the misfolded proteins to the degradation pathway is not clear. Recent studies have indicated that the misfolded glycoproteins show prolonged association with CNX; removal of mannose from N-linked oligosaccharides resulted in misfolded glycoproteins being led to a subsequent degradation pathway (26.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

We also examine whether oligosaccharide processing and association with CNX play a role in ER quality control in the case of the mutant α2PI proteins. Goat polyclonal anti-human α2PI antibody was purchased from Biopool (Umea, Sweden). Anti-calnexin-c, anti-calreticulin-c, and anti-ubiquitin polyclonal antibodies were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada).

All other chemicals were reagent-grade products and were purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan) unless otherwise indicated. The plasmid pSV2PI, a wild-type expression construct, carries the normal α2PI cDNA under the control of the SV40 promoter. The α2PI-Nara expression vector, pSV2PN, and the α2PI-Okinawa expression vector, pSV2PO, were constructed by replacing the normal α2PI cDNA with the cDNA fragments carrying the mutations. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in F-12 Nutrient Mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.), and HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan). Both media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For stable expression in CHO cells, both the expression vector DNA and pSVneo, which carries the G418gene conveying neomycin resistance, were introduced into the cells by the LipofectAMINE-mediated transfection procedure, and neomycin was employed for selection. The CHO cells transfected with pSV2PI, pSV2PN, or pSV2PO were pulse-labeled for 15 min with [35S]methionine and chased as described previously (7.Miura O. Hirosawa S. Kato A. Aoki N. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1598-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). CST, dMM, and LCT were added to the medium before the pulse-chase analysis. The inhibitors TLCK, TPCK, ALLN, ALLM, chloroquine, and leupeptin were added to the medium after pulse labeling. The α2PI proteins radiolabeled in the course of synthesis were immunoprecipitated using an excess of the antibody and protein G from cell lysates or conditioned medium and were then subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using a 10% acrylamide gel. Endo H digestion was performed as described previously (9.Miura O. Sugahara Y. Aoki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18213-18219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A nonstringent buffer, HBS containing 0.2m NaCl and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 2% CHAPS and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was used in experiments examining the association of α2PI proteins with CNX (29.Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation, by incubating the sample with goat anti-α2PI or rabbit anti-calnexin antibodies and protein G for 2 h, the precipitates were washed four times with lysis buffer. After incubation with HBS containing 1% SDS, the supernatants were diluted 20-fold in HBS containing 1% Nonidet P-40, and the α2PI proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-α2PI antibody and protein G. Bands were detected by autoradiography using Kodak XAR-5 film, and the proteins were quantified on the basis of the intensity of the bands by means of a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-imaging analyzer (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The CHO cells expressing either pSV2PI, pSV2PN, or pSV2PO were preincubated with LCT (20 μm) or ALLN (20 μm) for 16 h. The cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris-HCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 mm N-ethyl-maleimide), and the α2PI was immunoprecipitated. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and Western blot analysis was performed using an anti-ubiquitin antibody for detection. The blot was developed using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the detection of ubiquitinated p53 as the positive control, HepG2 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, were used. HepG2 cells were preincubated with LCT (20 μm) for 16 h and lysed in the lysis buffer by freezing and thawing four times. p53 was immunoprecipitated using the monoclonal antibody to p53, and Western blot analysis was performed. We examined the secretory process for normal and mutant α2PI proteins in stably transfected CHO cell lines. Most of the wild-type α2PI molecules with a molecular mass of 64 kDa disappeared from the cells within 2 h and were secreted into the culture medium with a molecular mass of 67 kDa (Fig.1 A). The secreted wild-type protein had complex oligosaccharides, which were resistant to Endo H digestion. The α2PI molecules in the cell extract were Endo H-sensitive. In contrast, the α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa molecules were not detected in the culture medium even after a 6-h chase period, and they were retained as Endo H-susceptible forms within the cells (Fig. 1 B). Because Endo H removes N-linked oligosaccharides from polypeptides during transit through the ER without any effect on the complex oligosaccharides already transferred to the medial stacks of the Golgi apparatus, the mutant molecules were retained in the ER. As observed in the case of the cells that transiently expressed these molecules, the retained mutant molecules did not accumulate but eventually disappeared. We tried to isolate misfolded proteins from the cells, but no insoluble fraction was detected. The mutant α2PI-Nara molecules were degraded in the pre-Golgi area. The time course of degradation of the mutant α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa molecules is shown in Fig. 1 C. The degradation of α2PI-Nara started 1.5 h after protein labeling. The half-life of the mutant molecules was about 4 h. The degradation of α2PI-Okinawa showed a similar pattern. The retained α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa each showed a change in molecular size during the pulse-labeling and chase periods (Fig. 1 B). The deglycosylated polypeptides treated with Endo H showed identical mobility. These findings indicate that the decrease in size of the retained proteins was the result of modification of the oligosaccharide moieties and not the result of a change in the radiolabeled polypeptides. We determined whether the decrease in size of the retained mutant α2PI molecules was a result of the hydrolysis of either glucose or mannose residues. The mobility of immunoprecipitated α2PI-Nara molecules preincubated with CST was retarded compared with that of the molecules without CST treatment. Digestion of the α2PI proteins with Endo H produced molecules with the same mobility (Fig. 2 a). This finding indicates that glucose residues were co-translationally hydrolyzed from oligosaccharides of the α2PI-Nara proteins. CST decreased the amount of expression of the proteins. The inhibition of glucose trimming might impair effective translation and translocation of the proteins. Treatment with dMM inhibited the reduction of the molecular size of α2PI-Nara. The molecular size of α2PI-Nara treated with dMM was smaller than that of the molecules at 0 h that were co-translationally hydrolyzed (Fig. 2 b). The post-translational removal of glucose residues preceded mannose trimming. These findings indicate that the decrease in size of the retained α2PI-Nara molecules was the result of post-translational hydrolysis of glucose and mannose residues from oligosaccharides of the mutant protein in the ER. Because the retained α2PI molecules were localized to the ER, it is evident that mannose processing was attributable to dMM-inhibitable mannosidase present in the ER (30.Rizzolo L.J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9520-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 32.Moremen K.W. Trimble R.B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 113-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Detailed analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the mobility of molecules treated with dMM corresponded to that observed after a 1.5-h chase period (Fig.2 c). The initiation of mannose trimming occurred after the 1.5-h chase period during which glucose trimming had occurred. The oligosaccharides of α2PI-Okinawa proteins were also found to undergo similar post-translational hydrolysis in the cells (data not shown). To examine whether specific proteases are involved in degradation of the mutant proteins, pulse-chase experiments were performed in the presence of inhibitors of several proteases and the proteasome. The lysosomal protease inhibitors used in this experiment had no effect on the total amount of radioactivity in the cell extracts after the 6-h chase period. The proteasome inhibitors ALLN and LCT markedly inhibited the degradation of the α2PI-Nara proteins, but the other inhibitors had no effect (Fig. 3 A). These proteins were not secreted from the cells even in the presence of the protease inhibitors or proteasome inhibitors. The mutant molecules that accumulated in cells treated with ALLN or LCT for 6 h had the same mobility as observed after a 6-h chase period in the absence of inhibitors, indicating the accumulation of mannose-trimmed forms (Fig.3 B). On the other hand, neither ALLN nor LCT had any effect on the secretion of wild-type α2PI stably expressed in CHO cells. The intracellular degradation of α2PI-Okinawa was also inhibited by ALLN and LCT (data not shown). These results indicate that the degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins was mediated by proteasomes. If the proteasome actually degrades the mutant proteins, mutant α2PI should be ubiquitinated before degradation. We examined whether the mutant proteins were conjugated with ubiquitin. Since ubiquitination of p53 has been reported (33.Maki C.G. Huibregtse J.M. Howley P.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2649-2654PubMed Google Scholar), we used p53 as a positive control. Although ubiquitinated p53 was detected, the mutant proteins were not ubiquitinated even in the presence of the inhibitors (Fig.3 C). As shown in Fig. 2 b, the blocking of mannose trimming by the mannosidase inhibitor dMM changed the mobility on SDS-PAGE and also inhibited the degradation of the mutant proteins. In contrast, blocking of glucose trimming by CST seemed to have no such inhibitory effect on their degradation. Therefore, we examined the effect of oligosaccharide trimming on their degradation (Fig.4, A and B). The degradation of the mutant proteins was rather accelerated as a result of CST treatment. On the other hand, dMM treatment markedly inhibited the degradation of the mutant proteins. The lag time of degradation seen in the case of the other inhibitors was not observed in the case of CST treatment. The ability of dMM to inhibit degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins was comparable with that seen in the case of LCT. Exposure of the cells to a combination of dMM and LCT did not result in an additive effect (data not shown). Similar results were obtained in the case of α2PI-Okinawa (data not shown). We examined the effect of the mannosidase inhibitor dMM on the degradation of the molecules when glucose trimming had been blocked by CST. Pre-incubation with CST blocked co-translational glucose trimming and accelerated the degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins (Fig. 5). Comparing the molecular sizes of the mutant proteins at 0 and 6 h, the mobility changed during the chase period. dMM blocked both their decrease in size and their degradation. LCT markedly inhibited the degradation of the molecules, but not the size reduction. When the cells were incubated with CST only after radiolabeling, post-translational glucose trimming was blocked, and the molecules were degraded. dMM and LCT also inhibited their degradation. These results suggest that the processing of mannose residues in the molecules occurred even without the removal of glucose. Also, mannose trimming was important for the accelerated degradation of the mutant α2PI-Nara molecules in cells treated with CST. Because CNX has been shown to bind monoglucosylatedN-linked oligosaccharides of nascent proteins in the ER, it has been speculated that the repeated binding of glucose to aglucosylated oligosaccharides of proteins might play a role in the selection of properly folded proteins for secretion and in the retention of unfolded proteins in the ER. To examine the role of the interaction between CNX and the α2PI proteins, pulse-labeled cells were lysed, and these proteins were co-immunoprecipitated by anti-CNX antibody under nonstringent conditions. The intensity of each band was quantified by a Fuji BAS 2000 Bio-imaging analyzer. The ratio of the intensity of the band of α2PI protein immunoprecipitated by anti-CNX antibody to that of the band of α2PI protein immunoprecipitated by anti-α2PI antibody at each time point was calculated and expressed as a percentage. About 10% of the wild-type α2PI molecules were associated with CNX for a short duration of 30 min (Fig. 6 A) and then secreted from the cells. In the case of α2PI-Nara, about 20% of the mutant proteins interacted with CNX for a longer duration of 90 min. Thereafter, CNX dissociated from the mutant α2PI-Nara despite the fact that the proteins were retained within the cells. α2PI-Okinawa also interacted with CNX. In the case of the hepatoma cell line HepG2, the cells are known to produce α2PI, which remains associated with CNX for a short duration. Despite the increase in retained mutant proteins, the mannosidase inhibitor dMM had no effect on the association of the mutant α2PI proteins with CNX (data not shown). On the other hand, treatment of the stable cell lines, or HepG2 cells, with CST blocked the interaction of the wild-type and mutant α2PI proteins with CNX (Fig.6 B). Binding of another ER chaperone, calreticulin, which is a soluble homologue of CNX, and binding of Bip with the wild-type or mutant α2PI molecules were not detected. In this study, we have shown that both α2PI-Nara and α2PI-Okinawa mutant proteins are degraded by proteasomes without ubiquitination. We also have demonstrated that inhibition of mannose trimming blocked the degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins with or without removal of glucose. Also, we characterized the difference in association of the wild-type and mutant α2PI proteins with CNX after translation. ER-associated degradation is well characterized for several transmembrane and luminal proteins (34.Hammond C. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 41-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This degradation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER is referred to as quality control and is distinct from lysosomal degradation. It has been recognized that the degradation of mutant proteins is mediated by the proteasome in the cytoplasm. ER forms of the multimembrane-spanning cystic fibrosis conductance regulator have been shown to be degraded by proteasomes, with the generation of ubiquitinated intermediates (17.Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Misfolded forms of this complex protein are recognized by enzymes of the ubiquitin-conjugating system and then targeted for destruction. Our study shows that mutant α2PI proteins also are degraded by the proteasome, but these mutants could not be detected in a ubiquitinated form. The proteasome has been shown to degrade ubiquitinated forms of proteins. However, several authors have reported that the proteasome is involved in degradation of proteins without ubiquitination. Ornithine decarboxylase, the best characterized substrate for regulated proteolysis, is degraded by a 26 S proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent fashion (35.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). Ornithine decarboxylase proteolysis depends on another targeting system for proteasomal degradation. It is unknown whether the mutant α2PI molecules are really degraded by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-independent manner. There are several possibilities to be considered in explaining the absence of ubiquitinated forms of the α2PI mutants. First, the ubiquitination of these proteins may vary depending on the cell lines used. Recent studies have shown that T-cell receptor-α subunit chains do not require ubiquitination for their degradation by proteasomes in non-T cells (36.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), whereas ubiquitinated T-cell receptor-α is detected easily when the proteasome function is inhibited in a T-cell line (27.Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Second, unlike other short-lived proteins, the half-life of the mutant α2PI is about 4 h, which is a relatively slow degradation process. The steady-state level of ubiquitinated forms may be low compared with the total number of molecules, probably depending on the activity of the cellular de-ubiquitinating enzymes, in which case the ubiquitinated forms would be scarcely detected. Another possible explanation is that there may be another ER-resident protease sensitive to LCT and ALLN. The quality control of mutant α2PI proteins is associated with oligosaccharide trimming and the assembly with molecular chaperones. It was found that degradation of the mutant α2PI molecules took place after a lag time of 1.5 h in the chase period. The end point of the lag time corresponded to the initiation of mannose trimming. N-linked oligosaccharides are co-translationally added to luminal asparagine residues of proteins as Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 (31.Elbein A.D. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The three terminal glucose residues are rapidly cleaved in the ER, and ER and cis-Golgi mannosidases carry out trimming of these high mannose chains (37.Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3779) Google Scholar). During the glucose trimming, the carbohydrate-binding luminal chaperone CNX preferentially associates with monoglucosylated oligosaccharides and facilitates protein folding (38.Hammond C. Helenius A. Science. 1994; 266: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Unfolded glycoproteins undergo a continuous cycle of binding to CNX in which assembly of the complex is facilitated by re-glucosylation of the asparagine-linked oligosaccharide by the ER-resident glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (39.Sousa M.C. Ferrero G.M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 40.Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The length of the lag time was also consistent with the duration of association of the mutant proteins with CNX. The mutant α2PI was found to be associated with CNX for a 3-fold longer time than that in the case of the wild-type α2PI molecules, which were led to the normal secretory pathway. The 1.5-h lag time before degradation of the mutant α2PI is a period during which the mutant proteins are provided multiple opportunities to fold properly. After the lag time, degradation of the mutant α2PI began with mannose trimming. The initiation of degradation corresponded to the time when the mutant α2PI molecules became dissociated from CNX and mannose trimming was initiated. Hammondet al. predict that permanent dissociation from the binding cycle would occur when hydrolysis of mannose residues generates an oligosaccharide unable to participate as a glucose acceptor, thereby leading to disposal of the unfolded glycoproteins. Blocking of mannose trimming by dMM inhibited the degradation of the mutant α2PI. In vitro analysis showed that CNX preferentially bound to Glc1Man9GlcNAc2. Furthermore, a decrease in mannose residues results in a poor affinity in binding to CNX (41.Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Modification of mannose resides in the CNX cycle is an important step in the initiation of degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins. The inhibitory effect of treatment with the mannosidase inhibitor was comparable with that observed in the case of proteasome inhibitors, but the combination of both inhibitors did not show an additive effect in blocking the degradation of the mutant α2PI proteins. Mannosidases and proteasomes function in the same pathway to degrade mutant proteins. Recent studies have shown that mannosidase activity has a role in determining the fate of several proteins including yeast pro/pre-α factor, mutant α1-antitrypsin, and T-cell receptor subunit CD 3-δ (26.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 27.Yang M. Omura S. Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. J. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14301-14309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that the removal of mannose residues from N-linked oligosaccharides plays a role in the selection of mutant proteins to enter the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway. Liu et al. (26.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7946-7951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 28.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) proposed a model in which, after dissociation from CNX, mannose residues of mutant α1-antitrypsin were trimmed and then the mannose-trimmed molecules targeted for disposal by proteasomes became bound to CNX again. Furthermore, Qu et al. (18.Qu D. Teckman J.H. Omura S. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22791-22795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) have reported that ubiquitination of CNX associated with variant α1-antitrypsin precedes proteasomal degradation of the molecules in a cell-free system. In our study, it was shown that mannose trimming of the mutant α2PI proteins that have dissociated from CNX is a very important process in targeting the mutant molecules for the proteasome degradation pathway. Although the association of mutant α2PI proteins with CNX was transient in this experiment, it is unknown whether the mutant α2PI proteins after mannose trimming bind to CNX prior to being degraded. Preincubation with the glucosidase inhibitor CST blocked the interaction between CNX and the mutant α2PI proteins and accelerated the degradation of α2PI mutants by the proteasome. In the presence of CST, the degradation of the mutant molecules took place without a lag time. This immediate degradation might be because of lack of association with CNX, which may partly explain the rapid degradation of the mutant molecules in the presence of CST. Our findings also suggest that the processing of mannose residues occurred even when the glucose residues were not processed. After the trimming of three glucose residues, processing of mannose residues takes place in general (30.Rizzolo L.J. Kornfeld R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9520-9525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When added to cultures of various types of animal cells, CST was found to prevent the processing of normal glycoproteins and therefore to cause the production ofN-linked glycoproteins of the Glc3Man7–9GlcNAc2 type (43.Pan Y.T. Hori H. Saul R. Sanford B.A. Molyneux R.J. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3975-3984Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In CHO cells, glycoprotein containing Glc3Man7GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was produced upon treatment with a glucosidase inhibitor (44.Petrescu A.J. Butters T.D. Reinkensmeier G. Petrescu S. Platt F.M. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4302-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Mannose processing can occur even without the removal of glucose resides. Although the secretion of these glycoproteins was not blocked, the location of mannosidase was not clear. Our results serve as indirect evidence, but alternate mannose processing may exist in the ER. It is unknown whether the process of the removal of mannose from the oligosaccharides of the CST-treated mutant α2PI proteins was specific to the cells used or specific to the proteins themselves. Mannose trimming may be a prerequisite for mutant α2PI molecules to be degraded by the proteasome. In our study, mannose trimming was found to be an important process in targeting the mutant α2PI molecules for the proteasome degradation pathway. Further studies are necessary to clarify the features of the quality control system for mutant proteins."

Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-Ks) are a family of enzymes that phosphorylate inositol phospholipids specifically at the D-3 position of the inositol ring. The phosphorylated lipid products of PI 3-Ks serve as second messengers that are involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation, apoptosis, cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, membrane trafficking, and glucose metabolism (18.Carpenter C.L.

Although it has been reported that wt BPV-1 E5 elevates basal PI 3-K activity in immunoprecipitates from NIH 3T3 cells, PI 3-K activation was presumed to result solely from the constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (26.Ghai J. Ostrow R.S. Tolar J. McGlennen R.C. Lemke T.D. Tobolt D. Liu Z. Faras A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12879-12884Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the possibility that PDGF-R-independent activation of PI 3-K constitutes an alternative pathway by which several new BPV-1 E5 mutants transform cells. We show that these new E5 mutants induce tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PI 3-K without significantly activating the PDGF-R or the ras-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signal transduction pathway. Thus, it appears that the E5 oncoprotein utilizes an additional signaling pathway for activating PI 3-K and mediating cell transformation that is independent of PDGF-R activation.

Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stable NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing the sisoncogene were similarly transfected and selected using a v-sis construct from J. Pierce (National Institutes of Health). To assess the proliferation of attached cells in defined media, 2 × 104 cells were plated in 60-mm tissue culture dishes in 4 ml of DMEM containing 2.5% FBS. After 24 h, 1 dish of each cell line was harvested using trypsin/EDTA treatment and counted (Coulter Electronics) to determine the initial cell density. The remaining cultures were washed with D-PBS, and the medium was replaced with 4 ml of DMEM containing 0.5% FBS (basal medium). To assay PDGF-dependent growth, basal medium was supplemented with recombinant human PDGF BB (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 20 ng/ml. Insulin-dependent growth was assayed in basal medium supplemented with bovine insulin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. After 3 days in defined media, the cells were harvested and counted as above to determine the final cell density. Results are expressed as the percent increase in the number of cells, which is 100 × (final density − initial density)/initial density. To analyze the contribution of PDGF-R signaling to proliferation, the selective PDGF-R kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG1296 (30.Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Bohmer A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.-H. Waltenberger J. Bohmer F.-D. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6106-6114PubMed Google Scholar), was added to cultures along with Me2SO (final 0.5%) as the cells were shifted into basal medium ± growth factors. A 5 mm stock solution of AG1296 (Calbiochem or Alexis Biochemicals) was prepared in Me2SO and stored as aliquots at −70 °C. To assay anchorage-independent growth, 1 ml of 0.3% agarose containing 1.7 × 103 cells was layered over 1 ml of 0.6% agarose in 35-mm dishes. A sterile 3% agarose stock solution was prepared in D-PBS and diluted to the above concentrations by mixing with DMEM (minus phenol red) containing 10% FBS and antibiotics (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cultures initially were overlaid with 0.5 ml of this medium and were given further additions as necessary to prevent desiccation for a period of 3–4 weeks. E5 expression was analyzed by immunoprecipitating epitope-tagged E5 protein from 100-mm tissue culture dishes of 80–90% confluent [35S]methionine-labeled cells using the AU1 monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co.) as described previously (9.Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3055-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For anti-PDGF-R and anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitations, 150-mm tissue culture dishes of 80–90% confluent cells were placed on ice and washed with 25 ml of D-PBS containing 1 mmNa3VO4. Cells were scraped into 0.9 ml of SDS lysis buffer (0.4% SDS, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4) at room temperature and were immediately heated for 10 min at 95 °C. The lysates were subjected to ultrasonic disruption (2 pulses of 10 s) using a Sonics and Materials, Inc. apparatus fitted with a microprobe. These were then mixed with 0.1 ml of 20% (w/v) Triton X-100 and were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 1000 × g. The protein concentration of clarified lysates was determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay with bovine IgG as the standard. Aliquots of lysates containing 0.8 mg of protein were mixed with 15 μl of protein A-agarose beads (Pierce; ImmunoPure Plus) and 4 μg of affinity-purified anti-PDGF-Rβ polyclonal antibody (Calbiochem) or 4 μg of 5H1 anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (a gift of A. Burkhardt and J. Bolen) and were rotated end over end for 90 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed 3 times with 1 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0) (5 min rotating end-over-end per wash) and 3 times with 1 ml of D-PBS. Bound proteins were eluted by incubating the beads in 40 μl of 1× SDS gel sample buffer (3% SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 1.5 mm EDTA, 11% sucrose, 0.008% bromphenol blue, 112 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8) for 20 min at 37 °C with occasional vortex mixing. Samples were then alkylated by the addition of 80 mm iodoacetamide and incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Electrophoresis was performed in 1.5-mm polyacrylamide Tris-glycine mini-gels (Novex) using alkylated molecular weight markers (Sigma). Gels were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and labeled with antibodies as outlined below. For immunoblot analysis, cells from 100-mm tissue culture dishes at 80–90% confluency were washed with 10 ml of D-PBS and scraped into 0.3 ml of 2× SDS gel sample buffer. The lysates were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and were subjected to ultrasonic disruption, alkylation, and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as above. SDS gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore) in a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot apparatus in (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3) at constant current (3200 mA × h for 1.5 mm gels). Membranes were blocked for 30 min at room temperature in WB (0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7.4) containing 2% bovine serum albumin (ICN 81003) and were labeled for 90 min with primary antibody diluted in WB + 2% bovine serum albumin: anti-PDGF-Rβ rabbit polyclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml, anti-PI 3-K (85 kDa subunit) rabbit polyclonal antibody at 1 μg/ml, anti-Erk2 monoclonal antibody at 2 μg/ml (Upstate Biotechnology), or anti-active MAPK (Erk1/Erk2) rabbit polyclonal antibody at 25 ng/ml (Promega). Subsequently, membranes were washed 3 times with 20 ml of WB (10 min/wash), labeled for 90 min with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Tropix) in WB + 2% bovine serum albumin (1:5000 dilution), and washed 3 times with WB. Labeled proteins were detected using the CDP-Star chemiluminescent substrate (Tropix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots were blocked for 2 h in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (Sigma, essentially fatty acid-free) and 1% (w/v) ovalbumin (blocking buffer) and were labeled overnight at 4 °C with an antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology clone 4G10) at a concentration of 1 μg/ml in blocking buffer. The immunoblots were washed 3 times with 20 ml of TBS (10 min/wash), labeled with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution in blocking buffer) for 90 min at room temperature, and washed with TBS again. Tyrosine-phosphorylated polypeptides were detected by means of chemiluminescence. PI 3-K activity was measured essentially as described by Soltoff et al. (31.Soltoff S.P. Carraway III, K.L. Prigent S.A. Gullick W.G. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3550-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from 150-mm tissue culture dishes at 80–90% confluency were washed twice with 25 ml of buffer A (137 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5) and scraped into 1 ml of lysis buffer (buffer A containing 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin) at 4 °C. After ultrasonic disruption and clarification, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from aliquots of lysates containing 0.5 mg of protein as described above. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer and 3 times with kinase assay buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0). PI 3-K activity of the immunoprecipitates was assayed by adding 5 μl of kinase assay buffer, 10 μl of 25 mm MgCl2, 250 μmATP, 1 mCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0; 20 μl of 0.5 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol (Avanti Polar Lipids) in 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.015% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0; and mixing continuously for 10 min at room temperature. Assays were terminated by the addition of 60 μl of 2 n HCl and 160 μl of chloroform-methanol (1:1) followed by vortex mixing and centrifugation for 30 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. 50 μl of the lipid-containing organic (lower) phase was spotted on Silica Gel 60 thin-layer chromatography plates (Merck) that had been prechromatographed in 1% (w/v) potassium oxalate and dried in a 70 °C oven. Samples were chromatographed for 30 min using chloroform/methanol/H2O/NH4OH (60:47:11.3:2) as the solvent. Plates were air-dried, and phosphorylated PI was detected by autoradiography at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. PI and PI phosphate standards (Calbiochem) were chromatographed in parallel with kinase assay samples and were visualized by exposing the chromatography plates to I2vapor. To study how BPV-1 E5 oncoprotein mutants transform fibroblast cell lines without activating the PDGF-R, we generated NIH 3T3 cell lines that stably express wt BPV-1 E5 and the E5 point mutants Q17S, L24A, L26A, and Q17G. Q17S E5, in which serine is substituted for glutamine at position 17, transforms NIH 3T3 cells with 39% the efficiency of wt E5 in a focus formation assay (27.Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but does not induce PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation, indicative of receptor activation (17.Sparkowski J. Mense M. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The L24A and L26A mutants, in which leucine residues at positions 24 and 26 of E5 are replaced with alanine, transform NIH 3T3 cells with 305% and 225% the efficiency of wt E5 but do not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF-R (14.Adduci A.J. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10249-10258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). As a negative control, we used Q17G E5, in which glycine is substituted for glutamine at position 17. This mutant does not transform NIH 3T3 cells (0% focus formation) (27.Sparkowski J. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6120-6123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and does not activate the PDGF-R (17.Sparkowski J. Mense M. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1, wt and mutant E5 proteins were expressed at similar levels in the cell lines. The expression of L24A E5 was somewhat higher, and E5 was not detected in normal NIH 3T3 cells. In some experiments, we employed an NIH 3T3 cell line that stably expresses the sis oncogene as a control. Constitutive expression of the PDGF B-like sis gene product in these cells causes transformation due to persistent activation of endogenous PDGF-Rs (32.Waterfield M.D. Scrace G.T. Whittle N. Stroobant P. Johnson A. Wasteson A. Westermark B. Heldin C.-H. Huang J.S. Deuel T.F. Nature. 1983; 304: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar, 33.Doolittle R.F. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Devare S.G. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Antoniades H.N. Science. 1983; 221: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). E5 was not detected in the sis-expressing cells (Fig. 1). The ability of E5 mutants to activate the PDGF-R was evaluated in the cell lines used in this study by analyzing levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-R in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Initially, tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were immunoprecipitated from serum-starved cells and then were immunoblotted to detect tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-Rs. For this analysis, cells were lysed in the presence of SDS and immediately boiled to avoid potential post-lysis phosphorylation/dephosphorylation or proteolysis. Boiling in SDS also served to disrupt protein-protein interactions, so that the anti-PDGF-R immunoblots reflected tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-Rs rather than unphosphorylated PDGF-Rs associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated protein(s). In addition, cells were incubated with Na3VO4 for 10 min before lysis to inhibit tyrosine phosphatases and optimize the detection of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGF-R on the immunoblots. As shown in Fig.2 A, serum-starved, control 3T3 cells exhibited basal levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated mature PDGF-R (mPDGF-R), whereas cells stimulated with 10% FBS showed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast, all other cell lines expressing either transformation-competent E5 constructs (wt, L26A, Q17S, or L24A) or the transformation-defective Q17G E5 mutant showed levels of mPDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation that were comparable with control 3T3 cells. As anticipated, although wt E5 did not increase tyrosine phosphorylation of the mPDGF-R, it did induce significant tyrosine phosphorylation of the immature PDGF-R (iPDGF-R) (Fig. 2 A), consistent with its primary localization in the Golgi apparatus (8.Burkhardt A. Willingham M. Gay C. Jeang K.-T. Schlegel R. Virology. 1989; 170: 334-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). No other E5 mutant induced significant phosphorylation of the iPDGF-R, although L24A E5 did promote a very low level of phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). These results were further evaluated by performing the reverse experiment under the same experimental conditions, i.e.immunoprecipitation with anti-PDGF-R antibodies and labeling the immunoblot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig.2 B, a high level of mPDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in normal 3T3 cells after the addition of 10% FBS, and an equally elevated level of iPDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation was seen in the wt E5 cell line. Unstimulated 3T3 cells and mutant E5 cell lines exhibited very low levels of PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation. Increased PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation in the wt E5 cell line was not due to enhanced expression of the PDGF-R; in fact, these cells contained somewhat lower levels of the receptor (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, as judged by tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of the mPDGF-R was induced only by serum, which is compatible with exogenous PDGF binding to cell-surface PDGF-Rs. Only wt E5 was able to induce significant phosphorylation of the iPDGF-R. In agreement with recent studies (14.Adduci A.J. Schlegel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10249-10258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar,17.Sparkowski J. Mense M. Anders J. Schlegel R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2420-2430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a number of transforming E5 mutants (L26A, Q17S, and L24A) induced only minimal phosphorylation of either the mPDGF-R or iPDGF-R. To employ criteria other than phosphorylation to demonstrate that the L26A, Q17S, and L24A transforming E5 mutants do not significantly activate the PDGF-R, cell lines expressing wt and mutant E5 proteins were tested for their ability to proliferate in 20-fold reduced levels of growth factors. As shown in Fig. 3 A, normal NIH 3T3 cells increased in number by only 60% over a period of 3 days in basal medium (DMEM + 0.5% FBS), and cells that expressed the nontransforming Q17G E5 mutant increased by only 160%. When basal medium was supplemented with recombinant PDGF, the number of 3T3 cells and Q17G E5-expressing cells increased by 340% and 440%, respectively. Moreover, the stimulation of cell proliferation by PDGF was sensitive to tyrphostin AG1296, a selective inhibitor of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase activity (30.Kovalenko M. Gazit A. Bohmer A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.-H. Waltenberger J. Bohmer F.-D. Levitzki A. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6106-6114PubMed Google Scholar). 20 μm tyrphostin AG1296 reduced the proliferation of 3T3 cells and Q17G E5-expressing cells to 120% and 140%, respectively, which were similar to levels of proliferation in the absence of PDGF (Fig. 3 A). The selectivity of tyrphostin AG1296 for the PDGF-R was demonstrated by its relatively minor effect on insulin-stimulated proliferation in these cell lines. 3T3 cells increased in number by 300%, and Q17G E5-expressing cells increased by 350% in basal medium supplemented with insulin. 20 μm tyrphostin AG1296 inhibited this growth by only 33 and 26%, respectively (Fig. 3 A). In contrast to the control 3T3 and Q17G E5-expressing cells, wt E5 andsis cell lines grew well in basal medium; cells expressing wt E5 increased by 340%, and cells expressing sis increased by 370% (Fig. 3 A). These increases were very similar to those of control 3T3 cells and Q17G E5-expressing cells in the presence of PDGF. Furthermore, the proliferation induced by wt E5 andsis was enhanced only slightly by PDGF (430% increase in cell number for wt E5 and 380% increase for sis) and was sensitive to tyrphostin AG1296 (120% and 110% increase in cell number in the presence of 20 μm inhibitor) (Fig. 3 A). The fact that tyrphostin AG1296 reduced the proliferation of wt E5- andsis-expressing cells to levels characteristic of control cells in basal medium (i.e. 3T3 and Q17G E5 cells) confirmed that wt E5 and sis enable proliferation in basal medium due to their activation of the PDGF-R. The proliferation in basal medium of cell lines expressing the transforming L26A, Q17S, and L24A E5 mutants was strikingly similar to that of control cells that do not activate the PDGF-R (Fig.3 A). Cells expressing L26A E5 increased in number by 40%, which was less than the proliferation of normal 3T3 cells. Q17S E5- and L24A E5-expressing cells increased by 140%, which was less than the proliferation of cells that expressed the nontransforming Q17G E5 mutant. The slowed proliferation of these cells in basal medium, however, was not the consequence of a general defect in cell growth, since the L26A E5 and L24A E5 cell lines multiplied at the same rate as normal 3T3 cells, Q17G E5 expressers, and sis-expressing cells in medium containing 10% FBS (Fig. 3 B). Cells expressing Q17S E5 multiplied at even a slightly higher rate (Fig.3 B). The results of these proliferation assays are therefore in agreement with the analysis of PDGF-R tyrosine phosphorylation and indicate that among the E5 constructs employed in this study only wt E5 significantly activate"

This linkage is essential for receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, since the Cys-86 → Ala (Mc4) and Cys-91 → Ala (Mc5) mutations abolished both events. Here, we used these mutants to examine whether disulfide-linked receptor dimerization affects the biological and biochemical activities of the IL-3 receptor. Murine T cells expressing hIL-3Rα and Mc4 or Mc5 did not proliferate in hIL-3, whereas cells expressing wild-type hβc exhibited rapid proliferation. However, a small subpopulation of cells expressing each mutant could be selected for growth in IL-3, and these proliferated similarly to cells expressing wild-type hβc, despite failing to undergo IL-3-stimulated hβc tyrosine phosphorylation. The Mc4 and Mc5 mutations substantially reduced, but did not abrogate, IL-3-mediated anti-apoptotic activity in the unselected populations. Moreover, the mutations abolished IL-3-induced JAK2, STAT, and AKT activation in the unselected cells, whereas activation of these molecules in IL-3-selected cells was normal. In contrast, Mc4 and Mc5 showed a limited effect on activation of Erk1 and -2 in unselected cells. These data suggest that whereas disulfide-mediated cross-linking and hβc tyrosine phosphorylation are normally important for receptor activation, alternative mechanisms can bypass these requirements.

The high affinity GM-CSF·IL-3·IL-5 receptor complexes are composed of specific α chains that bind GM-CSF·IL-3·IL-5 with low affinity (1.Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, 2.Kitamura T. Sato N. Arai K. Miyajima A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 1175-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) and a common β chain (βc) that converts the binding to high affinity by forming a heterodimer with the α subunit (4.Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The oligomerization of α and β subunits mediated by ligand binding is thought to initiate signal transduction. It is generally accepted that whereas the cytoplasmic domains of both α and β subunits are required for receptor activation, in some cases dimerization of the cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit alone is sufficient. This was demonstrated by a study in which a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor and the intracellular domain of βc or βIL-3was constructed. Erythropoietin induced proliferation signals in Ba/F3 cells through the chimeric receptors, indicating that the homodimerization of the β subunit is sufficient for receptor activation (5.Sakamaki K. Wang H.M. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Todokoro K. Harada N. Miyajima A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15833-15839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, a mutant GM-CSF receptor α chain (GM-CSFRα), in which the cytoplasmic domain was replaced with that of the βc, formed a high affinity receptor with the normal βc and transduced proliferative signals, again indicating the importance of the dimerization of the β cytoplasmic domain (6.Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In contrast, the βc mutant in which the cytoplasmic domain was substituted with that of GM-CSFRα forms a high affinity GM-CSFR with the GM-CSFRα but was unable to induce a proliferation signal, indicating that the dimerization of the GM-CSFRα cytoplasmic domain was not sufficient for signaling (6.Muto A. Watanabe S. Miyajima A. Yokota T. Arai K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 208: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Despite the lack of an intrinsic tyrosine kinase in the receptors, GM-CSF, IL-3, and IL-5 induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, including the β subunits themselves. It is now known that cytoplasmic JAK family tyrosine kinases associate with the β subunit via conserved membrane proximal regions known as “box-1” and “box-2” (7.Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 183-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8.Quelle F.W. Sato N. Witthuhn B.A. Inhorn R.C. Eder M. Miyajima A. Griffin J.D. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activated JAK kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues of many signaling proteins, among which are the latent cytoplasmic transcription factors known as signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT). The activation of JAKs and/or STATs is important for many if not all activities of cytokine receptors (7.Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 183-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 9.Sakai I. Kraft A.S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway is another major signaling pathway activated in response to GM-CSF and IL-3 (11.Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12.Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J.

It has been demonstrated that a membrane-distal region of βc is required for activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway (11.Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Circumstantial evidence implies that JAK2 is also required for activation of this pathway by IL-3 and GM-CSF. Deletion of the box-1 region in βc (which is believed to be the site of JAK2 association with βc) or expression of a dominant negative form of JAK2 prevented phosphorylation of molecules involved in Ras activation (Shc and SHP2) (7.Watanabe S.

Moreover, these same manipulations also blocked IL-3/GM-CSF-induced activation of the c-fos promoter (7.Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Allergy Clin.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is also blocked by dominant negative Ras (14.Watanabe S. Kubota H. Sakamoto K.M. Arai K. Blood. 1997; 89: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This pathway may also be important for cell survival (15.Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) (see also “Discussion”). Signaling pathways that promote cell survival also include the phosphatidylinositide-3′-OH kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. The AKT kinase is a general mediator of cytokine-induced survival and has been shown to suppress the apoptotic death of a number of cell types induced by a variety of stimuli, including growth factor withdrawal, cell cycle discordance, loss of cell adhesion, and DNA damage (18.Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H.

Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2253) Google Scholar). Thus, a signaling pathway has been defined in which cytokine receptor activation leads to the sequential activation of PI3K and AKT, which then promotes cell survival and blocks apoptosis. Our previous study (22.Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) showed that Cys-86 and Cys-91 but not other Cys residues of human βc (hβc) participated in disulfide-linked receptor subunit heterodimerization. We also showed that this linkage is essential for receptor phosphorylation because alanine substitutions of residues 86 (termed Mc4) and 91 (Mc5), but not 100 (Mc7), abolished not only IL-3-induced disulfide-linked IL-3 receptor subunit dimerization but also tyrosine phosphorylation of hβc, without affecting IL-3 binding. To investigate whether or not disulfide-mediated cross-linking of IL-3 receptor subunits and phosphorylation of hβc are essential for receptor signaling, we have now examined the effects of these cysteine mutations on biological and biochemical activities of the IL-3 receptor when expressed in the murine T cell line CTL-EN. We have found that hβc mutants Mc4 and Mc5 barely induce cell proliferation compared with wild-type (WT) or Mc7. Interestingly, a subpopulation of cells expressing each of the former mutants could be selected for growth in IL-3, which, despite the absence of detectable hβc tyrosine phosphorylation, proliferated at similar rates to cells expressing WT hβc. Our data also show that Mc4 and Mc5 (but not Mc7) impaired IL-3-facilitated protection against apoptosis and failed to induce IL-3-stimulated JAK2, STAT, and AKT activation in unselected cells. However, Mc4 and Mc5 had a less severe effect on IL-3-induced Erk1/2 MAP kinase activation in the unselected cells. In contrast, in the IL-3-selected cells, the cysteine mutations had no effects on IL-3-induced activation of any of the signaling molecules that we examined. The ecotropic ψ2 retrovirus packaging cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mml-glutamine, and antibiotics. The IL-2-dependent mouse T cell line, CTL-EN (a derivative of CTLL-2, described in Ref. 23.Jenkins B.J. Le F. Gonda T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8669-8677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was maintained in CTLL medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, antibiotics, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% conditioned medium from MLA cells, and 100 units/ml bacterially synthesized mouse IL-2. Cysteine mutants Mc4, Mc5, Mc7, or WT hβc cDNAs (22.Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol.

The pRufHygro retroviral vector was constructed by replacing the MC1Neo cassette of pRufNeo (24.Rayner J.R. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with a phosphoglycerate kinase/hygromycin resistance cassette from pPGKHygro (25.Mortensen R.M. Zubiaur M. Neer E.J. Seidman J.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7036-7040Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ecotropic packaging cell line ψ2 was transfected by a standard calcium phosphate transfection procedure as described (26.Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R.J. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of retroviral plasmid containing WT or cysteine mutant hβc per 10-cm dish. After overnight incubation the cells were shocked with 2.5 ml of 15% glycerol in DMEM for 4 min followed by a further 24 h incubation and then selected in hygromycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 200 μg/ml. The selected cells were sorted for expression of hβc, and collected in DMEM. These sorted ψ2 cells expressing WT or the cysteine mutant hβc were then used to infect CTL-EN cells previously infected with a pRUFNeo retrovirus vector (24.Rayner J.R. Gonda T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 880-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) encoding the α chain of human IL-3 receptor (hIL-3Rα), using procedures described previously (26.Jenkins B.J. D'Andrea R.J. Gonda T.J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4276-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The infected CTL-EN cells were selected in hygromycin at 600 μg/ml, and expression of WT or cysteine mutant hβc on the surface of the hygromycin-resistant cells was examined by flow cytometry. Cells expressing WT or cysteine mutant hβc were collected by cell sorting on a FACStarPLUS flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). Briefly, cells were washed and resuspended in cold DMEM supplemented with 5% FCS. Cells were incubated with the anti-hβc monoclonal antibody 8B8 (27.Sun Q. Jones K. McClure B. Cambareri B. Zacharakis B. Iversen P.O. Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Bagley C.J. D'Andrea R. Lopez A.F.

After washing and resuspension in medium, the cells were sorted, and the positive cells collected in CTLL medium. The procedures used for radiolabeling of human IL-3 with 125I and performing saturation-binding assays have been described previously (28.Stomski F. Sun Q. Bagley C. Woodcock J. Goodall G. Andrews R.

Infected CTL-EN cells expressing hIL-3Rα and WT or cysteine mutant hβc were washed three times with PBS, and triplicate samples of 5 × 103 cells were cultured in a 96-well microtiter plate with or without IL-3 for 72 h. Cell proliferation was measured by the CellTiter 96 Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega, Madison, WI). The data were normalized with respect to proliferation of the same cells cultured in 100 units/ml of IL-2. Apoptotic cells were detected using the Annexin-V-Fluos Staining kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells (5 × 105) were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in 100 μl of labeling solution (1:50 diluted Annexin-V-Fluos labeling reagent in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) and 1 μg/ml of propidium iodide) and then added to 0.4 ml of incubation buffer (10 mg of HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2). The cells were analyzed on a flow cytometer using a 488-nm excitation and a 515-nm band pass filter. CTL-EN cells coexpressing hIL-3Rα and WT or cysteine mutant hβc (4 × 107) were cultured overnight in the absence of cytokines. Cells were washed with cold PBS followed by stimulation at 37 °C for 5–15 min as indicated with varying concentrations of IL-3 (0–10 ng/ml) and then lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 2 mg/ml iodoacetamide, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.2 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and CompleteTM protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 15 min.

Blood. 1997; 90: 3005-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 75 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 90 min at 4 °C, washed twice with lysis buffer, and boiled in 1× reducing SDS loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates, or cell lysates prepared as described above, were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrophoretically transferred to ProtranR nitrocellulose transfer membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). Membranes were incubated with a blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 135 mm NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20)) at room temperature for 1 h and then incubated overnight with antibody in the same solution at 4 °C. The antibodies used were anti-JAK2 (as above); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY); anti-hβc (1C1; Ref. 28.Stomski F. Sun Q. Bagley C. Woodcock J. Goodall G.

The membranes were then washed three times in TBS-T solution and incubated with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (as appropriate) coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce). Membranes were washed in TBS-T three times and subjected to enhanced chemiluminescence detection as per the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Before reprobing, membranes were stripped in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 55 °C for 10 mim, washed three times in TBS-T, and blocked in TBS-T containing 3% bovine serum albumin. Nuclear extracts from CTL-EN cells expressing hIL-3Rα and WT or cysteine mutant hβc were prepared as described by Jenkinset al. (31.Jenkins B.J. Blake T.J. Gonda T.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 1989-2002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were mixed with radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the prolactin-responsive element in the bovine β-casein promoter, and EMSA was performed essentially as described by Barry et al.(32.Barry S.C. Moretti P.A.B. Korpeleinen E. D'Andrea R. Lopez A.F. Vadas M.A. Goodall G.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 842-852Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To introduce WT or cysteine mutant hβc into CTL-EN cells expressing hIL-3Rα, the cells were infected using ψ2 cells producing the corresponding RUFHygro retroviruses. The infected CTL-EN cells were selected in hygromycin in IL-2-containing medium, and cell surface expression of hβc was assessed by FACS analysis. Fig.1 shows that WT and cysteine mutant βc were expressed at comparable levels. Previous studies demonstrated that the cysteine mutations had no effect on the ligand binding in HEK293T cells (22.Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To confirm this finding in CTL-EN cells, we performed binding assays with 125I-IL-3. The results of Fig.2 show that all receptors, either WT or the cysteine mutants, had similar high affinity binding and were present in similar numbers, in agreement with previous results in HEK293T cells (22.Stomski F.C. Woodcock J.M. Zacharakis B. Bagley C.J. Sun Q. Lopez A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1192-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and the FACS analyses of Fig. 1.Figure 2Scatchard transformation of saturation binding studies performed on CTL-EN cells coexpressing hIL-3Rα and WT or cysteine mutant hβc as indicated. Binding assays were performed with 125I-labeled IL-3 over a concentration range of 10 pm to 10 nm. The data were analyzed using the LIGAND program, and the lines indicate the high affinity binding component for WT or Cys mutant hβc as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The growth of CTL-EN cells expressing WT hβc or the cysteine mutants cultured in hIL-3 (10 ng/ml) was monitored over a 3-day period. The results of Fig.3 A show that cells expressing Mc4 and Mc5 mutants did not exhibit detectable growth, whereas cells expressing the Mc7 mutant grew similarly to those expressing WT hβc. Interestingly, it was found that although most cells expressing Mc4 and Mc5 mutants could not grow or survive in IL-3, a small subset (we estimate ≤1%) of these cells grew out over a period of several weeks from IL-3-containing cultures. To distinguish these subsets, which were maintained in medium containing hIL-3, we will term these cells “IL-3-selected cells,” whereas the bulk population of (mutant) hβc-expressing cells, maintained in IL-2, will hereafter be termed “unselected cells.” It was found that the IL-3-selected cells proliferated at similar rates to the cells expressing WT hβc (Fig. 3 B) and did not grow or survive in medium lacking cytokines (data not shown). Moreover, polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of hβc from genomic DNA of the IL-3-selected cells confirmed the presence of the cysteine mutations,i.e. these cells were not genetic revertants. To examine whether the Mc4 and Mc5 mutations have an effect on cell survival, unselected CTL-EN cells expressing WT or cysteine mutant hβc were cultured in different concentrations of IL-3 for 48 h, following which the proportions of apoptotic cells were determined by annexin-V staining and FACS analysis. The results in Fig.4 A show that IL-3 at either low or high concentrations effectively protected the cells expressing WT or Mc7 from apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The cysteine mutations Mc4 and Mc5 significantly impaired, but importantly, did not completely abrogate the ability of IL-3 to protect the cells against apoptosis. This result was confirmed in the time course experiment shown in Fig. 4 B. The impairment by Mc4 and Mc5 of hIL-3-facilitated protection against apoptosis was evident at 48 h and was even more marked by 72 h. We previously showed that cysteine mutations Mc4 and Mc5 abrogated disulfide-linked IL-3 receptor dimerization and abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of hβc in response to IL-3 when expressed in HEK293T cells. To test whether this was also the case in the IL-3-selected CTL-EN cells, we performed Western blot analysis to detect tyrosine phosphorylation of hβc. The results of Fig. 5 show that the cysteine mutations Mc4 and Mc5 abolished IL-3-induced receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, which was, however, readily detected in cells expressing WT or Mc7. The activity of JAK2 is believed to be necessary for all the biological functions of IL-3 and GM-CSF (7.Watanabe S. Itoh T. Arai K. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 1996; 98: 183-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effects of the Mc4 and Mc5 mutations on JAK2 and STAT activation. In the case of unselected cells, it was found that phosphorylation of JAK2 was observed in cells expressing WT or Mc7 after stimulating the cells with 10 ng/ml hIL-3 but not in cells expressing the Mc4 or Mc5 mutants (Fig.6 A). Although no JAK2 activation was detected when the cells expressing WT or Mc7 were stimulated with a low concentration of hIL-3 (1 ng/ml), we found that IL-3 at a concentration of 1 ng/ml was able to support proliferation of cells expressing WT or Mc7 (data not shown; see also below). One class of effectors of JAK2 are the STAT transcription factors, which are phosphorylated and activated by JAK2. We therefore examined nuclear extracts from unselected cells expressing WT or mutant hβc for the presence of STAT DNA binding activity by performing EMSAs. After stimulation of the cells with 10 ng/ml IL-3, extracts from cells expressing WT or Mc7 contained a protein complex that specifically bound to a β-casein oligonucleotide probe containing a DNA-binding site for STATs 1, 3, and 5 (Fig. 6 B). However, no STAT activation was detected in cells expressing the Mc4 or Mc5 mutants (Fig. 6 B) after stimulation by IL-3. Weak STAT activation was also detected in cells expressing WT or Mc7 stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-3. The most likely explanation for this, considering that no JAK2 activation was detected with this concentration of IL-3, is simply that EMSA detection of STAT activity is more sensitive than detection of JAK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Because, as mentioned above, a subpopulation of cells expressing the cysteine mutants Mc4 or Mc5 could be selected for growth in IL-3, we investigated whether or not JAK2 and STATs were activated in IL-3-selected cells expressing these mutants. Fig. 6, C andD, shows that JAK2 and STAT activation was detected following stimulation with IL-3 at 10 ng/ml not only in cells expressing WT or Mc7 but, in contrast to the unselected cells, also in cells expressing Mc4 or Mc5. As for Mc7 and WT, weak activation of STAT but not JAK2 was also detected when a low concentration of IL-3 was used. One of the major signaling pathways activated in response to cytokines is the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase pathway (11.Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 12.Okuda K. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Kanakura Y. Hallek M. Griffin J.D. Druker B.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 2880-2887Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the cysteine mutations have an effect on hβc-mediated activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases, Western blot analyses of cell lysates from both unselected and IL-3-selected cells with an antibody specific for activated, i.e. phosphorylated, Erk1/2 MAP kinases were conducted. Fig. 7 A shows that phosphorylation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases was detected in unselected cells expressing WT or Mc7 mutant hβc when the cells were stimulated with 1 or 10 ng/ml hIL-3. Moreover, Erk1/2 phosphorylation was also clearly detected when cells expressing Mc4 or Mc5 were stimulated with 10 ng/ml hIL-3, although little or no phosphorylation above background was detected with 1 ng/ml hIL-3. In the case of IL-3-selected cells, activation of Erk1/2 MAP kinases was readily detectable in cells expressing WT and all of the cysteine mutant forms of hβc, regardless of whether the cells were stimulated with a low or high concentration of hIL-3 (Fig. 7 B). The activation of the PI3K and its downstream effector AKT has been shown to promote cell survival and suppress apoptosis (18.Ahmed N.N. Grimes H.L. Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Tsichlis P.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3627-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19.Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y. Greenberg M.E.

We therefore examined the levels of activated AKT kinase in both unselected and IL-3-selected CTL-EN cells expressing WT or mutant hβc. Western blot analysis of cell lysates from unselected cells using an antibody specific for phosphorylated AKT showed that AKT was activated in cells expressing WT or Mc7 but"

The larger of the two subunits (M r ∼118,000) contains a pair of homologous domains of approximately 400 residues each that are ∼40% identical in amino acid sequence. The carboxy phosphate (residues 1–400) and carbamoyl phosphate domains (residues 553–933) also contain ∼79 differentially conserved residues. These are residues that are conserved throughout the bacterial evolution of CPS in one of these homologous domains but not the other. The role of these differentially conserved residues in the structural and catalytic properties of CPS was addressed by swapping segments of these residues from one domain to the other. Nine of these chimeric mutant enzymes were constructed, expressed, purified, and characterized.

True tandem repeat chimeric proteins were constructed by the complete substitution of one homologous domain sequence for the other. Neither of the two possible chimeric proteins was structurally stable. These results have been interpreted to demonstrate that the two homologous domains in the large subunit of CPS are functionally and structurally nonequivalent.

This finding has led to the suggestion that the evolutionary development of CPS progressed from the duplication and subsequent fusion of an ancestral gene that encoded for a protein whose inherent catalytic properties were critical for the activation of bicarbonate. The functional properties of the various domains within the large subunit of CPS have been unveiled by an extensive set of site-directed mutants (9.Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol.

The chemical mechanism most consistent with all of the available biochemical data is presented below in Scheme FS1. The domain at the N-terminal end of the large subunit (residues 1–400) is required for the initial phosphorylation of bicarbonate to carboxy phosphate and the subsequent displacement of this phosphate group by ammonia to form the carbamate intermediate (9.Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Miles B.W. Mareya S.M. Post L.E. Post D.J. Chang S. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 232-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The domain found in the C-terminal half of the large subunit of CPS (residues 553–933) is required for the ultimate phosphorylation of carbamate to form carbamoyl phosphate (19.Raushel F.M. Anderson P.M. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5587-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These two segments of the large subunit have been designated as the carboxy phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate domains, respectively. The domain at the extreme C terminus (933–1073) of the large subunit is required for the binding of the two allosteric effectors, ornithine and UMP (25.Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The precise function of the remaining domain (residues 400–533) is unknown but it appears critical for the oligomerization of the heterodimer (16.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The recent x-ray crystallographic investigation of CPS from the laboratories of Holden and of Rayment (16.Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Wesenberg G. Raushel F.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6305-6316Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 17.Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Benning M.M. Rayment I. Holden H.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 8-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18.Holden H.M. Thoden J.B. Raushel F.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) has provided structural support for the properties of the various domains of this enzyme. Most remarkably, the x-ray study has demonstrated that the three active sites within the heterodimer are separated from one another by ∼45 Å. Moreover, the three individual active sites within the heterodimer are connected by two molecular tunnels, which presumably allow for the translocation of reactive intermediates from one domain to the next. A ribbon representation of the heterodimer is presented in Fig.2. Given the functional similarities required for the catalytic operation of the carboxy phosphate and the carbamoyl phosphate domains, it is not too surprising that the amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of these segments of the large subunit are similar to one another. However, the x-ray structure has clearly shown that whereas the structures of these two domains are similar, they are not identical. Moreover, the functional demands within the wild type protein on these two homologous domains are significantly different. For example, only the carboxy phosphate domain is required to have a binding site for association with the small subunit and to possess a conduit for the transfer of ammonia from the small to the large subunit. Moreover, only the carboxy phosphate domain must be able to catalyze amide bond formation. In contrast, the allosteric activation and inhibition of catalytic activity via ligand binding to the allosteric domain is limited to modulation of the carbamoyl phosphate domain. In this investigation we have set out to explore the limits of the structural and functional flexibility of the carboxy phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate domains. We seek to address the specific regions of these domains that differentiate the properties of one domain from the other. It is known that ∼40% of the amino acid sequence of these domains is identical and thus ∼60% of the sequence is different. Here we probe the structural and functional properties imposed on each of these domains by the differentially conserved residues in CPS. These are amino acid residues in either of the two domains that are conserved throughout the bacterial evolution of CPS but where the specific amino acid is not conserved with an identical amino acid at the homologous position within the other domain. The amino acid sequence alignment between the carboxy phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate domains, based on the x-ray crystal structure, is presented in Fig.3. The differentially conserved residues in both domains are highlighted by the black background. There are 51 residues in the carboxy phosphate domain and 28 residues in the carbamoyl phosphate domain that are differentially conserved. To address the functional flexibility of the two homologous domains in the large subunit of CPS, we have assembled an extensive series of chimeric reconstructions of the associated domains. In the initial set of mutations, a true tandem repeat has been created by the duplication of one entire domain and substitution of this domain for its homologous counterpart within the large subunit of CPS. These two chimeric proteins have been abbreviated as either N-N or C-C mutants. These mutant proteins are crude examples of a devolved CPS. To address the functional significance of the differentially conserved residues within each of the two homologous domains in the large subunit of CPS, clusters of differentially conserved residues were systematically reinserted back into the appropriate positions of the two tandem repeat mutants. The object here was to gradually make either of the tandem repeat proteins more like the wild type protein and to determine the minimum number of changes that would regenerate catalytic activity comparable to the wild type protein. These modifications are abbreviated as either N-N c or C n -C mutants. Finally, to determine if these differentially conserved regions could be moved from one domain into the homologous domain within the wild type protein, a series of such substitutions were created in the series N c -C and N-C n. Graphical representations of these reconstructions of the wild type and chimeric proteins are illustrated in Fig. 1. All chemicals and coupling enzymes used in the kinetic assays were purchased from Sigma. Bacto-tryptone and yeast extract were purchased from Difco. All restriction enzymes were supplied by Promega, Stratagene, New England Biolabs, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The VentR polymerase was obtained from New England Biolabs, whereas the pfu DNA polymerase was provided by Stratagene. For the isolation of DNA fragments, the Wizard miniprep polymerase chain reaction DNA purification kit was used. All plasmid DNA was isolated using Wizard miniprep plasmid DNA kits. The DNA sequence analysis and the synthesis of all oligonucleotides were provided by the Gene Technologies Facility in the Biology Department of Texas A&M University. The Escherichia coli strains used for this study were RC50 (car A50,thi-1, malA1, xyl-7,rspL135, λr, λ−, andtsx-237) and XL1-Blue (recA1, endA1,gyrA96, thi-1,hsdR17(rk−mk+),supE44, relA1, λ−, (lac)). The RC50 strain used for protein expression was a generous gift from Dr. Carol J. Lusty (Public Health Research Institute of New York). All plasmids used in this project were derived from pMS03 (10.Stapleton M.A. Javid-Majd F. Harmon M.F. Hanks B.A. Grahmann J.L. Mullins L.S. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14352-14361Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the polymerase chain reaction and the overlap extension method of Ho et al. (26.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The introduction and elimination of restriction sites within the plasmid pMS03 and the derivatives of this plasmid were done in every case by site-directed mutagenesis. All of the site-directed changes made to the wild type CPS were confirmed by DNA sequencing of the modified plasmids. The initial goal of this investigation was to make two mutant proteins that contained an internal tandem repeat of either the carboxy phosphate or carbamoyl phosphate domain. A scheme for the construction of these mutants is shown in Fig.4. It was necessary to create two plasmids from which the carboxy phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate domains could be excised by restriction digest at homologous positions. The plasmid pMS03 with the wild type sequence for CPS contains twoAccI restriction sites at codon positions 556 and 837 in thecarB gene. The restriction site at position 837 was removed to make plasmid pFMR02, and then a new XhoI restriction site at codon position 935 was introduced to make pFMR03. TheAccI restriction site at codon position 556 in the plasmid pFMR02 was removed by site-directed mutagenesis to make plasmid pFMR04. An AccI restriction site was added to pFMR04 at codon position 4, and then an XhoI site was introduced at codon position 402 to form pFMR07. The AccI/XhoI restriction fragments from pFMR03 and pFMR07 were isolated after incubation of the parent plasmids with the restriction enzymesAccI and XhoI. These fragments were swapped with one another and then religated to construct pNN01 and pCC01 according to the scheme that is presented in Fig. 4. Nine clusters of differentially conserved residues were selected for mutagenesis. Four of these differentially conserved clusters were identified within the carbamoyl phosphate domain, whereas five of these clusters were found in the carboxy phosphate domain. The entire sequence of amino acids within each of these nine differentially conserved clusters was substituted for those residues found in the homologous domain of the wild type protein. The plasmids for the N c -C series of mutants were constructed using pFMR07 as the template, whereas pFMR03 was used to construct the plasmids for the N-C n series of mutants. The sequences of the nine differentially conserved clusters from the carboxy phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate domains are highlighted in Fig. 3. The exact sequence substitutions and the specific protein designations for the N c -C and N-C nseries of mutants are listed in Table I.Table IAmino acid sequence of the native target regions and the corresponding replacementMutantAmino acid sequenceN1 –C 51 PATIMIDPEMADATYIE 67wild type sequence‖‖ ‖ ‖ ‖‖603 PETVSTDYDTSDRLYFE 619replacement sequenceN2–C171 SFTMGGSGGGI 181wild type sequence‖ ‖‖ ‖717 SYVLGGRAMEI 727replacement sequenceN3–C235 ENFDAMGIHTG 245wild type sequence‖ ‖‖‖780 EHIEQAGVHSG 790replacement sequenceN4–C369 GANDRLTTQMKSVG 382wild type sequence‖ ‖ ‖‖‖902 GVDPLLGPEMRSTG 915replacement sequenceN–C5717 SYVLG 721wild type sequence‖ ‖171 SFTMG 175replacement sequenceN–C6722 GRAMEI 727wild type sequence‖ ‖176 GSGGGI 181replacement sequenceN–C7752 LDHFLDDAVEVDVDA 766wild type sequence‖ ‖ ‖206 IDESLIGWKEYEMEV 220replacement sequenceN–C8775 IGGIMEHIEQAGVHSG 790wild type sequence‖ ‖ ‖‖‖230 IVCSIENFDAMGIHTG 245replacement sequenceN–C9845 RAARTVPF 852wild type sequence‖ ‖303 RVSRSSAL 310replacement sequence Open table in a new tab Table IIKinetic constants for the forward reaction catalyzed by chimeric CPS mutantsEnzymeEffectorcEffector concentrations: ornithine, 10 mm; UMP, 100 μm.Glutamine-dependent ATPasea5.0 mm ATP (when KHCO3 was the variable substrate) or 50 mm KHCO3 (when ATP was variable substrate).Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthesisb5.0 mm ATP, 50 mm KHCO3, and either 10 mm glutamine or 300 mm NH4Cl.KATPkcatKHCO3−kcatwith Glnkcat with ammoniaμmmin −1mmmin −1min −1Wild-typeNone440610Ornithine525401.629094UMP1100610N1–COrnithine<1<1<1N2–COrnithine<1<1<1N3–COrnithine564190135N4–COrnithine15037102221N–C5None270540Ornithine9846098326UMP120140N–C6None190130Ornithine210130302143UMP230150N–C7Ornithine1008686<1<1N–C8Ornithine7207.541<1<1N–C9Ornithine17007.5120<1<1pH 7.6, 25°C, 50 mm HEPES, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm Mg2+.a 5.0 mm ATP (when KHCO3 was the variable substrate) or 50 mm KHCO3 (when ATP was variable substrate).b 5.0 mm ATP, 50 mm KHCO3, and either 10 mm glutamine or 300 mm NH4Cl.c Effector concentrations: ornithine, 10 mm; UMP, 100 μm.

The N-N c mutants were constructed by excision of the mutated Nc domain from the plasmids containing the gene for the N c -C mutants. This fragment was then substituted for the corresponding fragment in the plasmid pNN01. The plasmids for the C n -C series of mutants were made in an analogous manner. Plasmids containing the genes for the mutants of CPS were transformed into the CPS-deficient E. coli strain RC50 for expression and subsequent purification of the mutant proteins. All E. colicells were grown in a modified Luria-Bertani broth medium containing 24 g of yeast, 12 g of tryptone, 0.4% glycerol (per liter), and 0.1 m potassium phosphate (9.Post L.E. Post D.J. Raushel F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7742-7747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transformed cells were grown in presence of 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 28 °C and harvested in the stationary phase. The majority of the mutant proteins were purified by the standard protocol as described previously by Mareya and Raushel (27.Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In some cases DNase I was used in place of protamine sulfate to precipitate DNA, and additional inhibitors were added to inactivate cellular proteases. In a few cases the gel filtration step was eliminated, and the protein was applied directly to the ion exchange column after filtration through a 0.45-micron cellulose acetate filter. The protein-containing fractions were identified by visualization on a 12.5% denaturing Phastgel. The fractions were pooled, concentrated to approximately 2 mg/ml, and stored at −70 °C until needed. The enzymatic activity for the forward and reverse reactions were conducted as described previously (27.Mareya S.M. Raushel F.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2945-2950Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The formation of carbamoyl phosphate was determined by measuring the amount of citrulline formed in a coupled assay with ornithine transcarbamoylase and ornithine (28.Snodgrass P.J. Parry D.J. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1969; 73: 940-950PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters, V m and K m, were determined by fitting the data to Equation 2 with computer programs obtained from Savanna Shell Software. In this equation, v is the initial velocity, V m is the maximal velocity,K m is the Michaelis constant, and A is the substrate concentration. The estimated errors were less than 20% for each of the catalytic constants presented in Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV. v=VmA/(Km+A)Equation 2 The pNN01 and pCC01 plasmids were transformed into the RC50 cell line, and multiple attempts were made to express and purify the two tandem repeat mutant proteins, N-N and C-C . The presence of both the large and small subunits of the N-N tandem repeat mutant of CPS in whole cells was observed with the aid of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. However, the large subunit was rapidly degraded to a molecular mass of approximately 102 kDa. The majority of the truncated large subunit was localized in the insoluble pellet, and attempts to solubilize the protein with urea failed. The truncated N-N mutant protein was partially purified (∼70%) and found unable to catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate (<0.007 units/mg). With this mutant we were unable to detect the catalytic hydrolysis of ATP that was dependent on the presence of bicarbonate nor were we able to measure the synthesis of ATP from ADP (partial back reaction) that was dependent on the presence of carbamoyl phosphate. Transformation of the pCC01 plasmid into RC50 failed to produce detectable quantities of the C-C chimeric protein, because only the small subunit was observed via SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Attempts were made to rescue the unstable N-N and C-C chimeric mutants by the incorporation of one or more segments of the differentially conserved residues back into the chimeric insert (see Fig. 1 and TableI). These new mutants, N-N 1, N-N 2, N-N 3, N-N 4, and N-N 1,2 (containing segments 1 and 2), were transformed into RC50. In every case both subunits were expressed, but the large subunit was always cleaved to a smaller fragment of 102 kDa and was insoluble. These N-N c mutants were not purified or further characterized. The series of mutants for the C-C n chimeric protein, C-C 7, C-C 8, and C-C 9, failed to show any expression of the large subunit. The last two series of mutants were designed to test the effect of substitution of whole segments of differentially conserved residues for their homologous counterparts in the other domain. Four mutants in the series N c -C were expressed in RC50 when grown at 28 °C. All four mutants were expressed in large quantities and the large subunit was the size expected for the full-length protein. A complete set of kinetic parameters for all four mutants is presented in TablesTable II, Table III, Table IV. In general, the incorporation of differentially conserved segments from the carbamoyl phosphate domain into the carboxy phosphate domain results in a crippling of the catalytic reactions that are known to occur within this domain. For example, neither N 1 -C nor N 2 -C was able to catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate at a significant rate. The mutant N 4 -C made carbamoyl phosphate in a coupled manner (forming one carbamoyl phosphate molecule for every two molecules of ATP hydrolyzed). In contrast, the mutant N 3 -C required five molecules of ATP molecules to be hydrolyzed for every carbamoyl phosphate formed. The N 1 -C and N 2 -C mutants had no ATPase activity that was dependent on the addition of bicarbonate or glutamine. The ATPase activity of the N 3 -C mutant was not enhanced by the presence of a nitrogen source and possessed a high K m for bicarbonate. Overall, the effects on the catalytic activity by these mutations were less severe on the partial back reaction. The k cat values for all four mutants were diminished, but the K m values for carbamoyl-P and ADP were generally lower than those exhibited by the wild type enzyme (Table III).Table IIIKinetic constants for ATP synthesis reaction catalyzed by chimeric CPS mutantsEnzymeEffectoraWhen allosteric effector was present, 10 mm ornithine or 100 μm UMP was used.KADPkcatKC-Pμmmin −1mmWild typeNone17067Ornithine22642.0UMP220035N1–COrnithine6464.8N2–COrnithine4.9140.4N3–COrnithine9.6220.3N4–COrnithine4.780.2N–C5None6016Ornithine11161.1UMP179019N–C6None93061Ornithine9006660UMP104013N–C 7Ornithine1701.422N–C8Ornithine7000.55N–C9Ornithine220.5120pH 7.5, 25°C, 20 mm Mg2+, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm carbarnoyl phosphate (when ADP was the variable substrate) or 5.0 mm ATP (when carbamoyl phosphate was variable substrate).a When allosteric effector was present, 10 mm ornithine or 100 μm UMP was used.

The expression levels of the five N-C n mutants constructed for this investigation were comparable with that of the wild type enzyme. The kinetic constants for the catalytic activity for each of the purified mutants are presented in Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV. Substitution of the differentially conserved regions from the carboxy phosphate domain into the homologous parts of the carbamoyl phosphate domain has virtually eliminated the ability of the N-C 7, N-C 8, and N-C 9 mutants to catalyze the formation of carbamoyl phosphate using either glutamine or ammonia as a nitrogen donor. For the mutants N-C 5 and N-C 6, the rate of carbamoyl phosphate formation was significantly reduced relative to the wild type enzyme, and the hydrolysis of ATP is measurably uncoupled from the assembly of carbamoyl phosphate. Perturbations were also noted in the rate of the bicarbonate-dependent ATP hydrolysis. For the N-C 8 and N-C 9 mutants, the rate of the ATP turnover was reduced by 5- and 4-fold, respectively. Conversely, the N-C 5, N-C 6, and N-C 7 mutants had an enhanced rate of ATP hydrolysis. The Michaelis constants for MgATP were increased for all of the mutants. The rate of ATP synthesis during the partial back reaction was significantly reduced by every mutation with the exception of N-C 6. TheK m for MgADP was similar to the wild type value for the N-C 9 and N-C"
