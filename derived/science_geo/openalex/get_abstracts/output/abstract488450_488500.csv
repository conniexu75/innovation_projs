https://openalex.org/W2008728387,"Completing the Set G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that transduce extracellular signals to activate diverse signaling pathways. Significant insight into GPCR function has come from structures of three of four classes of GPCRs—A, B, and Frizzled. Wu et al. (p. 58 , published online 6 March) complete the picture by reporting the structure of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1, a class C GPCR. The structure shows differences in the seven-transmembrane (7TM) domain between class C and other classes; however, the overall fold is preserved. Class C GPCRs are known to form dimers through their extracellular domains; however, the structure suggests additional interactions between the 7TM domains mediated by cholesterol."
https://openalex.org/W2022141988,"Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that occurs mainly in the tropics and subtropics but has a high potential to spread to new areas. Dengue infections are climate sensitive, so it is important to better understand how changing climate factors affect the potential for geographic spread and future dengue epidemics. Vectorial capacity (VC) describes a vector's propensity to transmit dengue taking into account human, virus, and vector interactions. VC is highly temperature dependent, but most dengue models only take mean temperature values into account. Recent evidence shows that diurnal temperature range (DTR) plays an important role in influencing the behavior of the primary dengue vector Aedes aegypti. In this study, we used relative VC to estimate dengue epidemic potential (DEP) based on the temperature and DTR dependence of the parameters of A. aegypti. We found a strong temperature dependence of DEP; it peaked at a mean temperature of 29.3°C when DTR was 0°C and at 20°C when DTR was 20°C. Increasing average temperatures up to 29°C led to an increased DEP, but temperatures above 29°C reduced DEP. In tropical areas where the mean temperatures are close to 29°C, a small DTR increased DEP while a large DTR reduced it. In cold to temperate or extremely hot climates where the mean temperatures are far from 29°C, increasing DTR was associated with increasing DEP. Incorporating these findings using historical and predicted temperature and DTR over a two hundred year period (1901–2099), we found an increasing trend of global DEP in temperate regions. Small increases in DEP were observed over the last 100 years and large increases are expected by the end of this century in temperate Northern Hemisphere regions using climate change projections. These findings illustrate the importance of including DTR when mapping DEP based on VC."

Kubacka et al. (p. 1333 , published online 6 March) used a strong terahertz electromagnetic pulse in resonance with an electromagnon—an excitation based on both electric and magnetic ordering—to control the spin dynamics of the multiferroic TbMnO 3 on a sub-picosecond time scale and induce the rotation of the spin-cycloid plane of the material."
https://openalex.org/W1978143333,"One-Sided Story from Disk In young analogs of the solar system, the ongoing erosion of comets and nascent planets produces dusty debris that is eventually expelled by the host star. Gas should also be released in this process when volatile ices sublimate, but it is detected less often. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, Dent et al. (p. 1490 , published online 6 March; see the Perspective by Brandeker ) mapped a highly asymmetric disk of dust and carbon monoxide orbiting the planet-hosting star, β Pictoris. The distribution of gas and dust is consistent with two proposed scenarios: In one, an outward-migrating planet has resonantly trapped dust-yielding bodies in two clumps opposite the star. In another, the entire debris mass is the result of a single recent collision of Mars-sized bodies."
https://openalex.org/W2003510670,"Marine ecosystem protection and conservation initiatives rely on the assessment of ecological integrity and health status of marine environments. The AZTI's Marine Biotic Index (AMBI), which consists on using macroinvertebrate diversity as indicator of ecosystem health, is used worldwide for this purpose. Yet, this index requires taxonomic assignment of specimens, which typically involves a time and resource consuming visual identification of each sample. DNA barcoding or metabarcoding are potential harmonized, faster and cheaper alternatives for species identification, although the suitability of these methods for easing the implementation of the AMBI is yet to be evaluated. Here, we analyze the requirements for the implementation of a genetics based AMBI (gAMBI), and show, using available sequence data, that information about presence/absence of the most frequently occurring species provides accurate AMBI values. Our results set the basics for the implementation of the gAMBI, which has direct implications for a faster and cheaper marine monitoring and health status assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2104850104,"Improved endurance exercise performance in adult humans after sprint interval training (SIT) has been attributed to mitochondrial biogenesis. However, muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and mitochondrial biogenesis during SIT have not been measured, nor have sex-specific differences. We hypothesized that males and females would have similar rates of MPS, mitochondrial biogenesis, and synthesis of individual proteins during SIT. Deuterium oxide (D2O) was orally administered to 21 adults [11 male, 10 female; mean age, 23±1 yr; body mass index (BMI), 22.8±0.6 kg/m(2); mean± SE] for 4 wk, to measure protein synthesis rates while completing 9 sessions of 4-8 bouts of 30 s duration on a cycle ergometer separated by 4 min of active recovery. Samples of the vastus lateralis were taken before and 48 h after SIT. SIT increased maximum oxygen uptake (VO(2max), males 43.4±2.1-44.0±2.3; females 39.5±0.9-42.5±1.3 ml/kg/min; P=0.002). MPS was greater in the males than in the females in the mixed (~150%; P < 0.001), cytosolic (~135%; P=0.038), and mitochondrial (~135%; P=0.056) fractions. The corresponding ontological clusters of individual proteins were significantly greater in the males than in the females (all P<0.00001). For the first time, we document greater MPS and mitochondrial biogenesis during SIT in males than in females and describe the synthetic response of individual proteins in humans during exercise training."
https://openalex.org/W2071952329,"Ecological opportunities promote population divergence into coexisting lineages. However, the genetic mechanisms that enable new lineages to exploit these opportunities are poorly understood except in cases of single mutations. We examined how two Escherichia coli lineages diverged from their common ancestor at the outset of a long-term coexistence. By sequencing genomes and reconstructing the genetic history of one lineage, we showed that three mutations together were sufficient to produce the frequency-dependent fitness effects that allowed this lineage to invade and stably coexist with the other. These mutations all affected regulatory genes and collectively caused substantial metabolic changes. Moreover, the particular derived alleles were critical for the initial divergence and invasion, indicating that the establishment of this polymorphism depended on specific epistatic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2111617381,"Recent studies have suggested that phosphatidic acid (PA), a cone-shaped phospholipid that can generate negative curvature of lipid membranes, participates in mitochondrial fusion. However, precise mechanisms underling the production and consumption of PA on the mitochondrial surface are not fully understood. Phosphatidic acid-preferring phospholipase A1 (PA-PLA1)/DDHD1 is the first identified intracellular phospholipase A1 and preferentially hydrolyzes PA in vitro. Its cellular and physiological functions have not been elucidated. In this study, we show that PA-PLA1 regulates mitochondrial dynamics. PA-PLA1, when ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, induced mitochondrial fragmentation, whereas its depletion caused mitochondrial elongation. The effects of PA-PLA1 on mitochondrial morphology appear to counteract those of MitoPLD, a mitochondrion-localized phospholipase D that produces PA from cardiolipin. Consistent with high levels of expression of PA-PLA1 in testis, PA-PLA1 knock-out mice have a defect in sperm formation. In PA-PLA1-deficient sperm, the mitochondrial structure is disorganized, and an abnormal gap structure exists between the middle and principal pieces. A flagellum is bent at that position, leading to a loss of motility. Our results suggest a possible mechanism of PA regulation of the mitochondrial membrane and demonstrate an in vivo function of PA-PLA1 in the organization of mitochondria during spermiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2157686463,"Autotaxin is a secreted enzyme that produces most extracellular lysophosphatidate, which stimulates 6 G-protein-coupled receptors. Lysophosphatidate promotes cancer cell survival, growth, migration, invasion, metastasis, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The present work investigated whether inhibiting autotaxin could decrease breast tumor growth and metastasis. We used a new autotaxin inhibitor (ONO-8430506; IC90=100 nM), which decreased plasma autotaxin activity by >60% and concentrations of unsaturated lysophosphatidates by >75% for 24 h compared with vehicle-treated mice. The effects of ONO-8430506 on tumor growth were determined in a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of breast cancer following injection of 20,000 BALB/c mouse 4T1 or 4T1-12B cancer cells. We show for the first time that inhibiting autotaxin decreases initial tumor growth and subsequent lung metastatic nodules both by 60% compared with vehicle-treated mice. Significantly, 4T1 cells express negligible autotaxin compared with the mammary fat pad. Autotaxin activity in the fat pad of nontreated mice was increased 2-fold by tumor growth. Our results emphasize the importance of tumor interaction with its environment and the role of autotaxin in promoting breast cancer growth and metastasis. We also established that autotaxin inhibition could provide a novel therapeutic approach to blocking the adverse effects of lysophosphatidate in cancer.—Benesch, M. G.

https://openalex.org/W2099026618,"Severe feather pecking (SFP) in commercial laying hens is a maladaptive behavior which is associated with anxiety traits. Many experimental studies have shown that stress in the parents can affect anxiety in the offspring, but until now these effects have been neglected in addressing the problem of SFP in commercially kept laying hens. We therefore studied whether parental stock (PS) affected the development of SFP and anxiety in their offspring. We used flocks from a brown and white genetic hybrid because genetic background can affect SFP and anxiety. As SFP can also be influenced by housing conditions on the rearing farm, we included effects of housing system and litter availability in the analysis. Forty-seven rearing flocks, originating from ten PS flocks were followed. Behavioral and physiological parameters related to anxiety and SFP were studied in the PS at 40 weeks of age and in the rearing flocks at one, five, ten and fifteen weeks of age. We found that PS had an effect on SFP at one week of age and on anxiety at one and five weeks of age. In the white hybrid, but not in the brown hybrid, high levels of maternal corticosterone, maternal feather damage and maternal whole-blood serotonin levels showed positive relations with offsprings’ SFP at one week and offsprings’ anxiety at one and five weeks of age. Disruption and limitation of litter supply at an early age on the rearing farms increased SFP, feather damage and fearfulness. These effects were most prominent in the brown hybrid. It appeared that hens from a brown hybrid are more affected by environmental conditions, while hens from a white hybrid were more strongly affected by parental effects. These results are important for designing measures to prevent the development of SFP, which may require a different approach in brown and white flocks."
https://openalex.org/W2109088899,"The expression of immune response appears to be associated with morbidity in Chagas disease. However, the studies in this field have usually employed small samples of patients and statistical analyses that do not consider the wide dispersion of cytokine production observed in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the plasma cytokine levels in well-defined clinical polar groups of chagasic patients divided into categories that better reflect the wide cytokine profile and its relationship with morbidity. Patients infected with Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) were grouped as indeterminate (IND) and cardiac (CARD) forms ranging from 23 to 69 years of age (mean of 45.6±11.25). The IND group included 82 individuals, ranging from 24 to 66 years of age (mean of 39.6±10.3). The CARD group included 94 patients ranging from 23 to 69 years of age (mean of 48±12.52) presenting dilated cardiomyopathy. None of the patients have undergone chemotherapeutic treatment, nor had been previously treated for T. cruzi infection. Healthy non-chagasic individuals, ranging from 29 to 55 years of age (mean of 42.6±8.8) were included as a control group (NI). IND patients have a higher intensity of interleukin 10 (IL-10) expression when compared with individuals in the other groups. By contrast, inflammatory cytokine expression, such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), proved to be the highest in the CARD group. Correlation analysis showed that higher IL-10 expression was associated with better cardiac function, as determined by left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular diastolic diameter values. Altogether, these findings reinforce the concept that a fine balance between regulatory and inflammatory cytokines represents a key element in the establishment of distinct forms of chronic Chagas disease."

We show that inhibition of ANO1 function is not sufficient to diminish proliferation of ANO1-dependent cancer cells. We report that CaCCinh-A01 reduces ANO1 protein levels by facilitating endoplasmic reticulum-associated, proteasomal turnover of ANO1. Washout of CaCCinh-A01 rescued ANO1 protein levels and resumed cell proliferation. Proliferation of newly derived CaCCinh-A01-resistant cell pools was not affected by CaCCinh-A01 as compared with the parental cells. Consistently, CaCCinh-A01 failed to reduce ANO1 protein levels in these cells, whereas ANO1 currents were still inhibited by CaCCinh-A01, indicating that CaCCinh-A01 inhibits cell proliferation by reducing ANO1 protein levels. Furthermore, we employed in silico methods to elucidate novel biological functions of ANO1 inhibitors. Specifically, we derived a pharmacophore model to describe inhibitors capable of promoting ANO1 degradation and report new inhibitors of ANO1-dependent cell proliferation.

Furthermore, ANO1 has been implicated to regulate tumor cell motility and metastasis via interaction with the cytoskeletal proteins of the ezrin/radixin/moesin family (16.Perez-Cornejo P. Gokhale A.

Therefore, ANO1 may represent a promising target for cancer therapy. head and neck squamous carcinoma esophageal squamous carcinoma calcium-activated chloride channel endoplasmic reticulum pentagalloyl glucose brefeldin A. The identification of inhibitors targeting the CaCC activity of ANO1 suggests that biochemical inhibition of ANO1 function is feasible and that targeted modulation could be of therapeutic benefit. However, many of the reported ANO1 inhibitors are natural products with a broad specificity and show activity only in the high micromolar range (17.De La Fuente R. Namkung W. Mills A.

CaCCinh-A01 has been shown to inhibit ANO1-dependent chloride conductance in cells and to decrease proliferation of ANO1-dependent cell lines (6.Britschgi A. Bill A. Brinkhaus H. Rothwell C. Clay I.

More recently, T16Ainh-A01, another small molecule inhibitor of ANO1 biochemical activity, has been reported (18.Namkung W. Phuan P.W. Verkman A.S. et al.TMEM16A inhibitors reveal TMEM16A as a minor component of calcium-activated chloride channel conductance in airway and intestinal epithelial cells.J. Biol.

However, direct binding of neither T16Ainh-A01 nor CaCCinh-A01 to ANO1 has been shown, and the mechanism of inhibition is still unknown. It remains unclear how inhibition of a transient chloride current results in inhibition of proliferation over a multiple-day time course. We sought to explore the mechanism of CaCCinh-A01-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation using a combined experimental and in silico approach. We show that CaCCinh-A01 but not T16Ainh-A01 inhibits proliferation of ANO1-amplified cell lines, indicating that inhibition of ANO1 biochemical activity was not sufficient to decrease cell proliferation because both inhibitors inhibited the channel activity of ANO1. Rather we show that CaCCinh-A01 inhibits cell proliferation by promoting endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated proteasomal degradation of ANO1. By performing structure-activity analysis based on the x-ray crystal structure of CaCCinh-A01, we developed a pharmacophore model and identified new inhibitors of ANO1-dependent cell proliferation, all of which facilitated ANO1 degradation. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of ANO1 activity is not sufficient to inhibit proliferation of ANO1-amplified cell lines, indicating that both ANO1 channel activity and ANO1 protein are required for its role in cancer. Furthermore, we have shown the utility of in silico pharmacophore modeling methods to guide the understanding of biological phenomena involving proteins that have only limited structural information available and are not readily accessible via experimentation. Virtual screens and pharmacophore alignments were performed with the Cresset suite of programs, including FieldAlign and FieldScreen (21.Cheeseright T. Mackey M. Rose S.

Structure-activity relationship and quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis were performed using Schrödinger's chemoinformatics program, Canvas (Canvas, version 1.5, Schrödinger, LLC, New York) (23.Duan J.

The 25 most potent compounds were considered. The data were split randomly into 75% training and 25% testing subsets. The most robust model proved to be the two-dimensional multiple linear regression model. R2 for the training set and the Q2 for the test set were both about 0.75, and the S.E. in the modeled value of the hit score was 0.06–0.07. Cell culture was performed as described previously (6.Britschgi A. Bill A. Brinkhaus H. Rothwell C. Clay I. Duss S. Rebhan M. Raman P. Guy C.T. Wetzel K. George E. Popa M.O. Lilley S. Choudhury H.

T16Ainh-A01 (Tocris), digallic acid (Toronto Research Chemicals), pentagalloyl glucose (PGG) (Sigma-Aldrich), tannic acid (Bosche Scientific), CaCCinh-NV2 and -NV7, brefeldin A (BFA), chloroquine, MG132 (Sigma-Aldrich), cycloheximide (Calbiochem), CaCCinh-A01 (Specs), CaCCinh-NV4 (ChemDiv), and all other compounds obtained from our internal archive were dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mm. If not noted otherwise, cells were treated with 10 μm compound. The Ca2+ complex of CaCCinh-A01 was prepared by adding 10 μl of a saturated solution of Ca(OH)2 in MeOH to a solution of 1 mg of CaCCinh-A01 in 200 μl of EtOH and letting the solvents evaporate at ambient temperature. Colorless crystals were obtained within 1 day. Diffraction data were collected with a Bruker AXS SMART 6000 CCD detector on a three-circle platform goniometer with Cu(Kα) radiation (λ = 1.54178 Å) from a Microstar rotating anode generator equipped with Incoatec multilayer mirrors. A semiempirical absorption correction was applied, based on the intensities of symmetry-related reflections measured at different angular settings (maximum and minimum transmission 0.8494 and 0.7290). The structure was solved by dual-space recycling methods and refined on F2 with the SHELXTL suite of programs. CaCCinh-A01 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P-1 as a hexamer with 0.33 eq of ethanol. The (disordered) ethanol molecule is coordinating Ca25. The disorder was modeled by refining two different orientations (a, b) with a 0.55 (a) to 0.45 (b) distribution. Two residual electron density peaks close to the inversion center were interpreted as half a methanol molecule. Although the respective hydrogen atoms at C56 and O57 were calculated in idealized positions, they interfere with H2 from one of the furane moieties. This might indicate that the residual electron density could also be interpreted as partially occupied water sites. All three CaCCinh-A01 ligands are disordered in the region of the tert-butyl group. This disorder was modeled by refining two different orientations (a, b) with the following distributions (a:b): 0.73:0.27 in ligand 1, 0.62:0.38 in ligand 2, and 0.64:0.36 in ligand 3. Bond lengths, angles, and displacement parameters of all minor occupancy orientations were restrained to be similar to those of the major occupancy orientations. For the major occupancy orientation atoms, anisotropic displacement parameters were used, and for the minor occupancy orientation atoms, isotropic displacement parameters were used (except for the ethanol molecule). Hydrogen atoms were calculated in idealized positions and refined using a riding model. Final data: C113 H144 N6 O31 S6 Ca3; Mr = 2394.94 (calculated for hexamer of CaCCinh-A01 with 3 Ca2+, 2 ethanol, 1 methanol), crystal size 0.12·0.08·0.06 mm3 (grown from methanol/ethanol), triclinic, space group P −1 (No. 2) with a = 14.329(4), b = 15.048(4), c = 15.612(4) Å, α = 69.862(14)°, β = 72.486(13)°, γ = 79.705(12)°, V = 3003.4(14) Å3, Z = 1, Dc = 1.324 g·cm−3, μ = 2.811 mm−1, F(000) = 1268, 64,238 reflections measured, 10,825 independent, Rint = 0.0392, 3.12° < θ < 68.33°, T = 100(2) K, 832 parameters, 687 restraints, R1 = 0.0395, wR2 = 0.1062 for 9408 reflections with I > 2σ(I), R1 = 0.0472, wR2 = 0.1145 for all 10,825 data, GoF = 1.030, restrained GoF = 1.038, res. el.dens. = +0.59/−0.36 e·Å3.

Compounds were rank-ordered by hit score. The hit score is given by Equation 1, hit score=16∑1,5,20μM(I1−1)2+(I2−1)2+S12+S22Eq. 1 where I and S are the average relative cell viability (normalized to DMSO-only-treated cells), with I1 and I2 as the two ANO1 inhibition-insensitive cell lines (Te1 and KYSE150) and S1 and S2 as the two CaCCinh-A01-sensitive and ANO1-dependent cell lines (Te11 and FaDu). Because the assays were run at varying concentrations of inhibitor (1, 5, and 20 μm), the summation is taken over the results obtained at all three concentrations. CaCCinh-A01 resulted in a hit score of 0.40. Compounds with a hit score smaller than 0.40 + 10% (hit score <0.44) were classified as a “hit” in subsequent assays.

In exponentially growing cells translating ribosomes are interspersed among and around the nucleoid lobes, appearing as alternative bands under a fluorescence microscope. In contrast, inactive ribosomes either in stationary phase or after treatment with translation inhibitors such as chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin gather predominantly at the cell poles and boundaries with concomitant compaction of the nucleoid. However, under all conditions, spatial segregation of the ribosomes and the nucleoids is well maintained. In dividing cells, ribosomes accumulate on both sides of the FtsZ ring at the mid cell. However, the distribution of the ribosomes among the new daughter cells is often unequal. Both the shape of the nucleoid and the pattern of ribosome distribution are also modified when the cells are exposed to rifampicin (transcription inhibitor), nalidixic acid (gyrase inhibitor), or A22 (MreB-cytoskeleton disruptor).

Recent advances in molecular biology with discovery of fluorescent proteins and their easy introduction into cells as protein tags have provided visual access into the interior of live bacterial cells. The developments in in-cell visualization technology either in live cells by using fluorescent protein tags or in fixed cells by immunofluorescence microscopy, have rendered the earlier image of bacterial cells as semipermeable sacs of chemicals untenable. The notion of structureless, homogeneous bacterial cytoplasm through which macromolecules diffuse freely to interact by random collisions has been replaced by a system of macromolecular machines designed for specific functions assembled at specific locations at appropriate times such that growth, replication, and cell division processes function in coordination to maintain remarkably error-free cycles of growth and reproduction for generations (1.Alberts B. et al.The cell as a collection of protein machines.

This paradigm shift in our understanding calls for a re-evaluation of the cellular processes and their regulation in terms of the spatiotemporal organization of macromolecular machines and their interactions inside living cells. Already in the early 1970s, Miller et al. (22.Miller Jr., O.L. Hamkalo B.A. Thomas Jr., C.A. et al.Visualization of bacterial genes in action.Science. 1970; 169: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) had demonstrated a close coordination between the transcription and translation machineries in Escherichia coli using electron microscopy. They showed that the mRNAs carrying polyribosomes spread out from the bacterial chromosome with the ribosomes attached to the nascent mRNAs linked to the bacterial chromosome through the transcribing RNA polymerase molecules. This observation lead to the concept of “coupled transcription translation” in bacteria, and a molecular link between these two processes was proposed (23.Burmann B.M. Schweimer K. Luo X. Wahl M.C.

This model was extended into a “transertion model” according to which a coupled transcription-translation and insertion of the nascent polypeptide chain into the membrane was proposed to regulate nucleoid morphology during its duplication and segregation in coordination with the cell cycle (3.Norris V. den Blaauwen T.

In contrast, in bacteria such as Caulobacter crescentus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, etc., the ribosomes and the DNA are not segregated in separate chambers (for review, see Ref. 26.Campos M.

These findings put a question mark on the indispensability of the coupled transcription-translation model as the determinant of the organization of the cellular machineries, and the search for alternative principles becomes crucial.

Except for some minor differences, the overall picture of ribosome distribution emerging from these studies agrees quite well with each other. Here we have attempted to examine the physiological significance of the observed pattern by comparing the distribution of the fluorescent protein-tagged ribosomes in E. coli during growth and in quiescence. In parallel, the shape and organization of the nucleoids have been followed with DAPI fluorescence. The effect of various drugs known to affect translation, transcription, or the nucleoid topology on the distribution of the ribosomes has been investigated. Moreover, the change in distribution of the ribosomes in growing and dividing cells has been followed in real time using time-lapse imaging. Our results confirm that the relative distribution of the ribosomes and the nucleoid in a bacterial cell is dynamic and highly sensitive to the conditions of growth and its arrest. We demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge that the ribosomes gather in the mid-cell around the septal site determined by the FtsZ ring before cell division, and despite that, the ribosome distribution in the daughter cells is frequently unequal. Furthermore, we show that although the disruption of MreB cytoskeleton severely affects the ribosome distribution, protein synthesis continues uninterrupted at least for two to three generations. Altogether, our results point toward a global interlink between these apparently independent subcellular structures and stages of bacterial growth. All bacterial strains used in this work are derivatives of the E. coli K12 MG1655 (WT) (listed in Table 1). Fig. 1A shows the scheme for fusing mCherry tag to the ribosomal protein (r-protein) L9. The termination codon of the gene rplI (encoding L9) on the chromosome of E. coli MG1655 (WT) was replaced by a linear DNA containing the DNA sequence coding for the red fluorescent protein mCherry (32.Shaner N.C.

The recombinants with L9-mCherry fusion were selected against kanamycin and verified by PCR and sequencing. One successful recombinant was named QC101 (MG1655 rplI-mCherryKanR, see Table 1). Colony PCR of QC101 with primers flanking the rplI gene locus produced a band of 2 kb confirming successful fusion of the mCherry-KanR cassette (1.5 kb) to the rplI gene (0.5 kb) (Fig. 1B). A similar fusion of mCherry was also done with tufB gene (encoding elongation factor Tu or EF-Tu) resulting in strain QC702 (MG1655 tufB-mCherry KanR) (Table 1).TABLE 1The description of the strains and plasmids used/generated in this workGenetic constructionStrain descriptionDoubling timeSourceminE. coli strainsMG1655Wild type E. coli K-12WT21 ± 0.5Laboratory strainQC101MG1655 rplI-mCherry KanL9-mCherry21 ± 0.4This workQC901MG1655 rpsF-TurboGFP TetS6-TurboGFP27 ± 1.6This workQC501MG1655 rplI-TurboGFP TetL9-TurboGFP21 ± 1.0This workQC702MG1655 tufB-mCherry KanEF-Tu-mCherry22 ± 0.5This workQC801QC501 tufB-mCherry KanS6-TurboGFP + EF-Tu-mCherry25 ± 0.7This workBS433QC101 + pEG12 [Plac (ftsZ-GFP)]L9-mCherry + FtsZ-GFP21 ± 3This workPlasmidspSIM5pSC101repts (λ gam exo bet cat)(33.Datta S.

Growth rates of all the strains used in this work were measured at 37 °C in LB (without any antibiotic) using a Bioscreen C Analyzer (Oy Growth Curves Ab Ltd, Helsinki, Finland). Each well was inoculated with a 1000-fold dilution of an overnight culture, and measurements were made in quadruplicate. The cultures were grown for 16 h with continuous shaking, and A600 values were recorded every 5 min The doubling times were estimated from early log phase (A600 = between 0.02 and 0.1) (Table 1). The 70 S ribosome and the ribosomal subunits were isolated from QC101, QC901, QC702, and QC801 strains using conventional sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation method. Specific localization of the fluorescence protein-tagged r-proteins and EF-Tu was confirmed by Western blots of total cell lysates, crude ribosome pellets isolated by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g at 4 °C for 120 min (marked as r-pellet in Fig. 1), and supernatant (cleared after pelleting the ribosomes by ultracentrifugation) as well as purified 70 S ribosome and its 30 S and 50 S subunits using antibodies raised against mCherry (MBL International Corp.) or TurboGFP (Evrogen) (Fig. 1C). Antibodies specific to the r-proteins S1 and L12 were used to identify ribosomal small and large subunits, respectively. Furthermore, fluorescence spectra of these ribosomal components (15 pmol each) were recorded using a Hitachi F7000 spectrofluorometer (Fig. 1D). For mCherry-tagged components the excitation was done at 555 nm. For Turbo GFP fusions the excitation wavelength was 450 nm. It has been shown that exponentially growing cultures above a cell density of 5 × 107/ml (A600 = 0.1) contain a subpopulation of stationary phase cells and that the proportion of such quiescent cells increase with cell density (36.Akerlund T. Nordström K. Bernander R. et al.Analysis of cell size and DNA content in exponentially growing and stationary-phase batch cultures of Escherichia coli.J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6791-6797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, only bacterial cultures with A600 = 0.1 or less were used for exponential phase studies. For cells in stationary phase, overnight cultures were used. For visualizing DNA, DAPI stain was used. To avoid DNA damage DAPI was added only a few minutes before data collection. Antibiotics were added to early exponential cultures (at final concentrations: 10 μg/ml cephalexin, 200 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, 200 μg/ml rifampicin, 30 μg/ml nalidixic acid, and 10 μg/ml A22). Aliquots withdrawn at different time intervals were spotted directly on thin layers of 1% agarose (AgarGel H/M Mercury) in 0.9% NaCl or nutrient medium for examination under a Carl Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope using a 100× objective (NA = 1.40, depth of focus 0.66 μm). The images were captured with a Carl Zeiss Axio-Cam CCD camera. The filter sets for mCherry were HC F 36-504, for TurboGFP were D480/40, and for DAPI were D360/40. The intensity scan for individual cells was performed along the longitudinal axis of the cell using Axiovision digital image analysis software and integrated over the whole cell width. Autofluorescence was measured with MG1655 cells, which varied from 3 to 6%. Confocal fluorescence images were acquired using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 Meta) using a 63× oil objective (NA = 1.4) and LSM software. An argon laser (514 nm) was used at 25% intensity, and images were captured using a 512 × 512-pixel frame. Gain settings were between 650 and 800. Scan speed was set to seven and the mean of four lines was detected. Zoom function was set to one, and the pinhole was set to one airy unit. Z-series were used to capture the whole bacterium. QC101 cells were grown in the presence of [3H]valine in M9 culture media without or with drugs chloramphenicol (200 μg/ml) and A22 (10 μg/ml). Aliquots withdrawn at definite time intervals were filtered through glass filters after treating with 5% TCA. The filters were dried after isopropyl alcohol wash, and counts measured in Beckman liquid scintillation counter were plotted against time. The fluorescent protein-tagged ribosomes were constructed by fusing genes encoding fluorescent proteins mCherry or TurboGFP with two individual r-protein genes from the large and small subunits (rplI and rpsF encoding protein L9 and S6, respectively) at their chromosomal loci. The resulting strains were named QC101 (L9-mCherry), QC501 (L9-TurboGFP), and QC901 (S6-TurboGFP). The L9 fusion strains QC101 and QC501 showed similar doubling time (21 min) in LB at 37 °C as its wild type parent (MG1655). Thus we conclude that the fluorescent protein fusions at this site had no deleterious effect on the growth rate of the bacteria (Table 1). However, QC901 (S6-TurboGFP) showed somewhat impaired growth (doubling time 27 ± 1.5 min) (Table 1). Therefore, this strain was used only for qualitative confirmation of the results obtained with QC101. The strain QC702 with EF-Tu-mCherry fusion showed a doubling time of 22 min, which is again similar to MG1655. In contrast, the strain with double fusion, QC801 (S6-TurboGFP + EF-Tu-mCherry), showed a longer doubling time (25 ± 0.7 min) (Table 1). We suspect that this slow growth behavior of QC801 is probably due to the S6-TurboGFP fusion as QC901 (S6-TurboGFP) also showed similar growth defect. The absence of free L9-mCherry protein in the cytosol and its exclusive association with the 50 S ribosomal subunits in the cell were confirmed by Western blots with anti-mCherry antibody. As shown in the Fig. 1C, L9-mcherry could be detected in the cell lysate, ribosomal pellet, and purified 70 S ribosome and 50 S subunit samples. The absence of mCherry in the supernatant fraction after pelleting the ribosomes by ultracentrifugation indicated that there was no extra-ribosomal L9-mCherry protein in the cytosol. Furthermore, the absence of L9-mCherry in the 30 S sample confirmed its exclusive presence in the 50 S subunit (Fig. 1C). This was further assured by demonstrating that the 70 S ribosomes and the 50 S subunits, but not the 30 S subunits, were fluorescent (Fig. 1D). The fluorescence emission from QC101 70 S and 50 S matched the characteristic spectrum of mCherry protein (λmax = 610 nm). The minor fluorescence seen in the 30 S sample was probably due to its incomplete separation from the 50 S subunit in the sucrose gradient step. Similar to L9-mCherry in QC101, S6-TurboGFP in QC901 also showed exclusive localization in the 30 S subunit of the ribosome when analyzed with Western blot using antibody against TurboGFP (Fig. 1E). In contrast to the r-protein fusions, the EF-Tu-mCherry in QC702 and QC801 was identified solely in the supernatant fractions after pelleting the ribosomes (Fig. 1F). The strain QC801, which carried L9-TurboGFP fusion in addition to EF-Tu-mCherry fusion, showed an exclusive presence of L9-TurboGFP in the ribosome (Fig. 1D). The fusion of the fluorescent proteins and their cellular location were further confirmed by checking mCherry and/or TurboGFP fluorescence of ribosomal pellet or supernatant without ribosomes. Fig. 2, A–C and E) illustrates the intracellular distribution of the m-Cherry tagged ribosomes and DAPI-stained nucleoids inside live E. coli QC101 (L9-mCherry) cells grown in rich medium. In exponentially growing cells, the translating ribosomes and the nucleoid lobes appeared as alternative bands arranged lengthwise spanning from one pole to the other (Fig. 2A), which is in good agreement with the earlier reports (15.Lewis P.J.

We investigated the long-term consequences of SAH on behavior, neuroinflammation and gray- and white-matter damage using an endovascular puncture model in Wistar rats. Rats were divided into a mild or severe SAH group based on their acute neurological score at 24 h post-SAH. The degree of hemorrhage determined in post-mortem brains at 48 h strongly correlated with the acute neurological score. Severe SAH induced increased TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10, MCP-1, MIP2, CINC-1 mRNA expression and cortical neutrophil influx at 48 h post-insult. Neuroinflammation after SAH was very long-lasting and still present at day 21 as determined by Iba-1 staining (microglia/macrophages) and GFAP (astrocytes). Long-term neuroinflammation was strongly associated with the degree of severity of SAH. Cerebral damage to gray- and white-matter was visualized by immunohistochemistry for MAP2 and MBP at 21 days after SAH. Severe SAH induced significant gray- and white-matter damage. MAP2 loss at day 21 correlated significantly with the acute neurological score determined at 24 h post-SAH. Sensorimotor behavior, determined by the adhesive removal task and von Frey test, was affected after severe SAH at day 21. In conclusion, we are the first to show that SAH induces ongoing cortical inflammation. Moreover, SAH induces mainly cortical long-term brain damage, which is associated with long-term sensorimotor damage."

https://openalex.org/W1964362949,"Boar-sperm cryopreservation is not usually performed immediately after semen collection, but rather a holding time (HT) of 4 h-30 h at 17°C is spent before starting this procedure. Taking this into account, the aim of this study was to go further in-depth into the mechanisms underlying the improving effects of HT at 17°C on boar-sperm cryotolerance by evaluating the effects of two different HTs (3 h and 24 h) on overall boar-sperm function and survival before and after cryopreservation. Given that phospho/dephosphorylation mechanisms are of utmost importance in the overall regulation of sperm function, the phosphorylation levels of serine residues (pSer) in 30 different sperm proteins after a 3 h- or 24 h-HT period were also assessed. We found that a HT of 24 h contributed to a higher sperm resistance to freeze-thawing procedures, whereas mini-array protein analyses showed that a HT of 24 h induced a significant (P<0.05) increase in pSer (from 100.0±1.8 arbitrary units in HT 3 h to 150.2±5.1 arbitrary units in HT 24 h) of HSP70 and, to a lesser extent, in protein kinases GSK3 and total TRK and in the cell-cycle regulatory protein CDC2/CDK1. In the case of HSP70, this increase was confirmed through immunoprecipation analyses. Principal component and multiple regression analyses indicated that a component explaining a percentage of variance higher than 50% in sperm cryotolerance was significantly correlated with pSer levels in HSP70. In addition, from all the parameters evaluated before freeze-thawing, only pSer levels in HSP70 resulted to be able to predict sperm cryotolerance. In conclusion, our results suggest that boar spermatozoa modulate its function during HT, at least partially, by changes in pSer levels of proteins like HSP70, and this is related to a higher cryotolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2094211383,"Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is the major cholesterol transport protein in the brain. Among the three human APOE alleles (APOE2, APOE3, and APOE4), APOE4 is the strongest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD). The accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a central event in AD pathogenesis. Increasing evidence demonstrates that apoE isoforms differentially regulate AD-related pathways through both Aβ-dependent and -independent mechanisms; therefore, modulating apoE secretion, lipidation, and function might be an attractive approach for AD therapy. We performed a drug screen for compounds that modulate apoE production in immortalized astrocytes derived from apoE3-targeted replacement mice. Here, we report that retinoic acid (RA) isomers, including all-trans-RA, 9-cis-RA, and 13-cis-RA, significantly increase apoE secretion to ~4-fold of control through retinoid X receptor (RXR) and RA receptor. These effects on modulating apoE are comparable with the effects recently reported for the RXR agonist bexarotene. Furthermore, all of these compounds increased the expression of the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 and ABCG1 levels and decreased cellular uptake of Aβ in an apoE-dependent manner. Both bexarotene and 9-cis-RA promote the lipidation status of apoE, in which 9-cis-RA promotes a stronger effect and exhibits less cytotoxicity compared with bexarotene. Importantly, we showed that oral administration of bexarotene and 9-cis-RA significantly increases apoE, ABCA1, and ABCG1 levels in mouse brains. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RXR/RA receptor agonists, including several RA isomers, are effective modulators of apoE secretion and lipidation and may be explored as potential drugs for AD therapy."

The genus is composed of 22 species and two subspecies, but the relationship between its lifestyle and genome is little understood. In this study, two high-quality draft genomes were generated from Anoxybacillus spp. SK3-4 and DT3-1, isolated from Malaysian hot springs. De novo assembly and annotation were performed, followed by comparative genome analysis with the complete genome of Anoxybacillus flavithermus WK1 and two additional draft genomes, of A. flavithermus TNO-09.006 and A. kamchatkensis G10. The genomes of Anoxybacillus spp. are among the smaller of the family Bacillaceae. Despite having smaller genomes, their essential genes related to lifestyle adaptations at elevated temperature, extreme pH, and protection against ultraviolet are complete. Due to the presence of various competence proteins, Anoxybacillus spp. SK3-4 and DT3-1 are able to take up foreign DNA fragments, and some of these transferred genes are important for the survival of the cells. The analysis of intact putative prophage genomes shows that they are highly diversified. Based on the genome analysis using SEED, many of the annotated sequences are involved in carbohydrate metabolism. The presence of glycosyl hydrolases among the Anoxybacillus spp. was compared, and the potential applications of these unexplored enzymes are suggested here.

https://openalex.org/W2140807870,"Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) virus is an emerging bunyavirus that causes a hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate. The virus is likely tick-borne and replicates primarily in hemopoietic cells, which may lead to disregulation of proinflammatory cytokine induction and loss of leukocytes and platelets. The viral genome contains L, M, and S segments encoding a viral RNA polymerase, glycoproteins Gn and Gc, nucleoprotein (NP), and a nonstructural S segment (NSs) protein. NSs protein is involved in the regulation of host innate immune responses and suppression of IFNβ-promoter activities. In this article, we demonstrate that NSs protein can form viroplasm-like structures (VLSs) in infected and transfected cells. NSs protein molecules interact with one another, interact with NP, and were associated with viral RNA in infected cells, suggesting that NSs protein may be involved in viral replication. Furthermore, we observed that NSs-formed VLS colocalized with lipid droplets and that inhibitors of fatty acid biosynthesis decreased VLS formation or viral replication in transfected and infected cells. Finally, we have demonstrated that viral dsRNAs were also localized in VLS in infected cells, suggesting that NSs-formed VLS may be implicated in the replication of SFTS bunyavirus. These findings identify a novel function of nonstructural NSs in SFTSV-infected cells where it is a scaffolding component in a VLS functioning as a virus replication factory. This function is in addition to the role of NSs protein in modulating host responses that will broaden our understanding of viral pathogenesis of phleboviruses.—Wu, X., Qi, X., Liang, M., Li, C., Cardona, C.

With the aim to generate specific molecular probes able to target EGFRvIII with high affinity, we selected four DNA aptamers (U2, U8, U19 and U31) specifically bound to U87-EGFRvIII cells that over expressed EGFRvIII with Kd values in the nanomole range by a cell-based systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (cell-SELEX) process. U87MG cells were introduced as control cells for counter selection. We further affirmed U2 and U8 identified EGFRvIII on the surface of target cells specifically. Then we radiolabeled U2 with 188Re to serve as a molecular imaging probe and observed 188Re -labeled U2 significantly targeted EGFRvIII over-expressing glioblastoma exnografts in mice. In conclusion, aptamers obtained from whole cell-SELEX strategy have great potential as molecular imaging probes that are probably beneficial to GBM diagnoses."
https://openalex.org/W2106326286,"There is neither a single clinical, microbiological, histopathological or genetic test, nor combinations of them, to discriminate aggressive periodontitis (AgP) from chronic periodontitis (CP) patients. We aimed to estimate probability density functions of clinical and immunologic datasets derived from periodontitis patients and construct artificial neural networks (ANNs) to correctly classify patients into AgP or CP class. The fit of probability distributions on the datasets was tested by the Akaike information criterion (AIC). ANNs were trained by cross entropy (CE) values estimated between probabilities of showing certain levels of immunologic parameters and a reference mode probability proposed by kernel density estimation (KDE). The weight decay regularization parameter of the ANNs was determined by 10-fold cross-validation. Possible evidence for 2 clusters of patients on cross-sectional and longitudinal bone loss measurements were revealed by KDE. Two to 7 clusters were shown on datasets of CD4/CD8 ratio, CD3, monocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, INF-γ and TNF-α level from monocytes, antibody levels against A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a.) and P.gingivalis (P.g.). ANNs gave 90%–98% accuracy in classifying patients into either AgP or CP. The best overall prediction was given by an ANN with CE of monocyte, eosinophil, neutrophil counts and CD4/CD8 ratio as inputs. ANNs can be powerful in classifying periodontitis patients into AgP or CP, when fed by CE values based on KDE. Therefore ANNs can be employed for accurate diagnosis of AgP or CP by using relatively simple and conveniently obtained parameters, like leukocyte counts in peripheral blood. This will allow clinicians to better adapt specific treatment protocols for their AgP and CP patients."
https://openalex.org/W1994849388,"Membrane asymmetry is essential for generating second messengers that act in the cytosol and for trafficking of membrane proteins and membrane lipids, but the role of asymmetry in regulating membrane protein function remains unclear. Here we show that the signaling lipid phosphoinositide 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) has opposite effects on the function of TRPV1 ion channels depending on which leaflet of the cell membrane it resides in. We observed potentiation of capsaicin-activated TRPV1 currents by PI(4,5)P2 in the intracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane but inhibition of capsaicin-activated currents when PI(4,5)P2 was in both leaflets of the membrane, although much higher concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 in the extracellular leaflet were required for inhibition compared with the concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 in the intracellular leaflet that produced activation. Patch clamp fluorometry using a synthetic PI(4,5)P2 whose fluorescence reports its concentration in the membrane indicates that PI(4,5)P2 must incorporate into the extracellular leaflet for its inhibitory effects to be observed. The asymmetry-dependent effect of PI(4,5)P2 may resolve the long standing controversy about whether PI(4,5)P2 is an activator or inhibitor of TRPV1. Our results also underscore the importance of membrane asymmetry and the need to consider its influence when studying membrane proteins reconstituted into synthetic bilayers."
https://openalex.org/W1967294399,"14-3-3 proteins are a family of ubiquitous dimeric proteins that modulate many cellular functions in all eukaryotes by interacting with target proteins. 14-3-3s exist as a number of isoforms that in Arabidopsis identifies two major groups named ε and non-ε. Although isoform specificity has been demonstrated in many systems, the molecular basis for the selection of specific sequence contexts has not been fully clarified. In this study we have investigated isoform specificity by measuring the ability of different Arabidopsis 14-3-3 isoforms to activate the H+-ATPase. We observed that GF14 isoforms of the non-ε group were more effective than ε group isoforms in the interaction with the H+-ATPase and in the stimulation of its activity. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of GF14ε and GF14ω isoforms, representative of ε and non-ε groups respectively, with the H+-ATPase, have been determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance analysis demonstrating that the higher affinity of GF14ω is mainly due to slower dissociation. The role of the C-terminal region and of a Gly residue located in the loop 8 and conserved in all non-ε isoforms has also been studied by deletion and site-specific mutagenesis. The C-terminal domains, despite their high divergence, play an auto-inhibitory role in both isoforms and they, in addition to a specific residue located in the loop 8, contribute to isoform specificity. To investigate the generality of these findings, we have used the SPOT-synthesis technology to array a number of phosphopeptides matching known or predicted 14-3-3 binding sites present in a number of clients. The results of this approach confirmed isoform specificity in the recognition of several target peptides, suggesting that the isoform specificity may have an impact on the modulation of a variety of additional protein activities, as suggested by probing of a phosphopeptide array with members of the two 14-3-3 groups."
https://openalex.org/W2043209028,"Predicting how climatic variations will affect marine predator populations relies on our ability to assess foraging success, but evaluating foraging success in a marine predator at sea is particularly difficult. Dive metrics are commonly available for marine mammals, diving birds and some species of fish. Bottom duration or dive duration are usually used as proxies for foraging success. However, few studies have tried to validate these assumptions and identify the set of behavioral variables that best predict foraging success at a given time scale. The objective of this study was to assess if foraging success in Antarctic fur seals could be accurately predicted from dive parameters only, at different temporal scales. For this study, 11 individuals were equipped with either Hall sensors or accelerometers to record dive profiles and detect mouth-opening events, which were considered prey capture attempts. The number of prey capture attempts was best predicted by descent and ascent rates at the dive scale; bottom duration and descent rates at 30-min, 1-h, and 2-h scales; and ascent rates and maximum dive depths at the all-night scale. Model performances increased with temporal scales, but rank and sign of the factors varied according to the time scale considered, suggesting that behavioral adjustment in response to prey distribution could occur at certain scales only. The models predicted the foraging intensity of new individuals with good accuracy despite high inter-individual differences. Dive metrics that predict foraging success depend on the species and the scale considered, as verified by the literature and this study. The methodology used in our study is easy to implement, enables an assessment of model performance, and could be applied to any other marine predator."
https://openalex.org/W2032287572,"Angiotensin (ANGII) and secretin (SCT) share overlapping, interdependent osmoregulatory functions in brain, where SCT peptide/receptor function is required for ANGII action, yet the molecular basis is unknown. Since receptors for these peptides (AT1aR, SCTR) are coexpressed in osmoregulatory centers, a possible mechanism is formation of a cross-class receptor heterocomplex. Here, we demonstrate such a complex and its functional importance to modulate signaling. Association of AT1aR with SCTR reduced ability of SCT to stimulate cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), with signaling augmented in presence of ANGII or constitutively active AT1aR. Several transmembrane (TM) peptides of these receptors were able to affect their conformation within complexes, reducing receptor BRET signals. AT1aR TM1 affected only formation and activity of the heterocomplex, without effect on homomers of either receptor, and reduced SCT-stimulated cAMP responses in cells expressing both receptors. This peptide was active in vivo by injection into mouse lateral ventricle, thereby suppressing water-drinking behavior after hyperosmotic shock, similar to SCTR knockouts. This supports the interpretation that active conformation of AT1aR is a key modulator of cAMP responses induced by SCT stimulation of SCTR. The SCTR/AT1aR complex is physiologically important, providing differential signaling to SCT in settings of hyperosmolality or food intake, modulated by differences in levels of ANGII."
https://openalex.org/W2002391573,"Understanding of relationships between morphology and ecological performance can help to reveal how natural selection drives biological diversification. We investigate relationships between feeding behavior, foraging performance and morphology within a diverse group of teleost fishes, and examine the extent to which associations can be explained by evolutionary relatedness. Morphological adaptation associated with sediment sifting was examined using a phylogenetic linear discriminant analysis on a set of ecomorphological traits from 27 species of Neotropical cichlids. For most sifting taxa, feeding behavior could be effectively predicted by a linear discriminant function of ecomorphology across multiple clades of sediment sifters, and this pattern could not be explained by shared evolutionary history alone. Additionally, we tested foraging efficiency in seven Neotropical cichlid species, five of which are specialized benthic feeders with differing head morphology. Efficiency was evaluated based on the degree to which invertebrate prey could be retrieved at different depths of sediment. Feeding performance was compared both with respect to feeding mode and species using a phylogenetic ANCOVA, with substrate depth as a covariate. Benthic foraging performance was constant across sediment depths in non-sifters but declined with depth in sifters. The non-sifting Hypsophrys used sweeping motions of the body and fins to excavate large pits to uncover prey; this tactic was more efficient for consuming deeply buried invertebrates than observed among sediment sifters. Findings indicate that similar feeding performance among sediment-sifting cichlids extracting invertebrate prey from shallow sediment layers reflects constraints associated with functional morphology and, to a lesser extent, phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1993314306,"A small population of cancer stem cells named the “side population” (SP) has been demonstrated to be responsible for the persistence of many solid tumors. However, the role of the SP in leukemic pathogenesis remains controversial. The resistance of leukemic stem cells to targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), results in therapeutic failure or refractory/relapsed disease in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The drug pump, ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2), is well known as a specific marker of the SP and could be controlled by several pathways, including the PI3K/Akt pathway. Our data demonstrated that compared with wild-type K562 cells, the higher percentage of ABCG2+ cells corresponded to the higher SP fraction in K562/ABCG2 (ABCG2 overexpressing) and K562/IMR (resistance to imatinib) cells, which exhibited enhanced drug resistance along with downregulated phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome -10 (PTEN) and activated phosphorylated-Akt (p-Akt). PTEN and p-Akt downregulation could be abrogated by both the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Moreover, in CML patients in the accelerated phase/blastic phase (AP/BP), increased SP phenotype rather than ABCG2 expression was accompanied by the loss of PTEN protein and the up-regulation of p-Akt expression. These results suggested that the expression of ABCG2 and the SP may be regulated by PTEN through the PI3K/Akt pathway, which would be a potentially effective strategy for targeting CML stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2092650285,"Alginate from marine seaweeds is receiving continuous attention owing to its wide physiological activities. Herein, we sought to elucidate possible effects of alginate-derived polyguluronate (PG) and unsaturated guluronate oligosaccharide (GOS) on antibacterial activities of macrophages. Our results showed that, in contrast to PG, GOS markedly increased the phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus and further inhibited the survival of intracellular bacteria in macrophages. In line with this, GOS treatment resulted in the enhanced expression of Fcγ receptors on macrophages. In addition, GOS activated NF-κB pathway, induced TNF-α secretion, and elevated the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase and the production of nitric oxide. Meanwhile, GOS stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species in macrophages. Moreover, guluronate trimer to hexamer (G3–G6) in GOS exhibited significant activity that increased the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages, with the pentamer (G5), displaying the highest activity. Finally, our in vivo results further confirmed that GOS but not PG significantly improved bacterial clearance in murine acute peritonitis. In conclusion, GOS enhances antibacterial activities of macrophages via modulating signaling pathways related to innate immunity, suggesting that GOS might be a promising therapeutic candidate to improve the host defense against bacterial infection.

https://openalex.org/W1976093627,"We describe an extensive ichnofossil assemblage from the likely Cenomanian-age 'lower' and 'upper' units of the 'Kem Kem beds' in southeastern Morocco. In the lower unit, trace fossils include narrow vertical burrows in cross-bedded sandstones and borings in dinosaur bone, with the latter identified as the insect ichnotaxon Cubiculum ornatus. In the upper unit, several horizons preserve abundant footprints from theropod dinosaurs. Sauropod and ornithischian footprints are much rarer, similar to the record for fossil bone and teeth in the Kem Kem assemblage. The upper unit also preserves a variety of invertebrate traces including Conichnus (the resting trace of a sea-anemone), Scolicia (a gastropod trace), Beaconites (a probable annelid burrow), and subvertical burrows likely created by crabs for residence and detrital feeding on a tidal flat. The ichnofossil assemblage from the Upper Cretaceous Kem Kem beds contributes evidence for a transition from predominantly terrestrial to marine deposition. Body fossil and ichnofossil records together provide a detailed view of faunal diversity and local conditions within a fluvial and deltaic depositional setting on the northwestern coast of Africa toward the end of the Cretaceous."
https://openalex.org/W2148335420,"Testosterone (T), alone or in combination with progestin, provides a promising approach to hormonal male contraception. Its principle relies on enhanced negative feedback of exogenous T to suppress gonadotropins, thereby blocking the testicular T production needed for spermatogenesis, while simultaneously maintaining the extragonadal androgen actions, such as potency and libido, to avoid hypogonadism. A serious drawback of the treatment is that a significant proportion of men do not reach azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia, commensurate with contraceptive efficacy. We tested here, using hypogonadal luteinizing hormone/choriongonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) knockout (LHR(-/-)) mice, the basic principle of the T-based male contraceptive method, that a specific T dose could maintain extragonadal androgen actions without simultaneously activating spermatogenesis. LHR(-/-) mice were treated with increasing T doses, and the responses of their spermatogenesis and extragonadal androgen actions (including gonadotropin suppression and sexual behavior) were assessed. Conspicuously, all dose responses to T were practically superimposable, and no dose of T could be defined that would maintain sexual function and suppress gonadotropins without simultaneously activating spermatogenesis. This finding, never addressed in clinical contraceptive trials, is not unexpected in light of the same androgen receptor mediating androgen actions in all organs. When extrapolated to humans, our findings may jeopardize the current approach to hormonal male contraception and call for more effective means of inhibiting intratesticular T production or action, to achieve consistent spermatogenic suppression."
https://openalex.org/W1982320096,"PKCδ suppresses keratinocyte proliferation via a mechanism that involves increased expression of p21(Cip1). However, the signaling mechanism that mediates this regulation is not well understood. Our present studies suggest that PKCδ activates p38δ leading to increased p21(Cip1) promoter activity and p21(Cip1) mRNA/protein expression. We further show that exogenously expressed p38δ increases p21(Cip1) mRNA and protein and that p38δ knockdown or expression of dominant-negative p38 attenuates this increase. Moreover, p53 is an intermediary in this regulation, as p38δ expression increases p53 mRNA, protein, and promoter activity, and p53 knockdown attenuates the activation. We demonstrate a direct interaction of p38δ with PKCδ and MEK3 and show that exogenous agents that suppress keratinocyte proliferation activate this pathway. We confirm the importance of this regulation using a stratified epidermal equivalent model, which mimics in vivo-like keratinocyte differentiation. In this model, PKCδ or p38δ knockdown results in reduced p53 and p21(Cip1) levels and enhanced cell proliferation. We propose that PKCδ activates a MEKK1/MEK3/p38δ MAPK cascade to increase p53 levels and p53 drives p21(Cip1) gene expression."

The differences between types and size of cells makes AT one of the most disperse and complex organs. Lipid storage is partly shared by other tissues such as muscle and liver. We intended to obtain an approximate estimation of the size of lipid reserves stored outside the main fat depots. Both male and female rats were made overweight by 4-weeks feeding of a cafeteria diet. Total lipid content was analyzed in brain, liver, gastrocnemius muscle, four white AT sites: subcutaneous, perigonadal, retroperitoneal and mesenteric, two brown AT sites (interscapular and perirenal) and in a pool of the rest of organs and tissues (after discarding gut contents). Organ lipid content was estimated and tabulated for each individual rat. Food intake was measured daily. There was a surprisingly high proportion of lipid not accounted for by the main macroscopic AT sites, even when brain, liver and BAT main sites were discounted. Muscle contained about 8% of body lipids, liver 1–1.4%, four white AT sites lipid 28–63% of body lipid, and the rest of the body (including muscle) 38–44%. There was a good correlation between AT lipid and body lipid, but lipid in “other organs” was highly correlated too with body lipid. Brain lipid was not. Irrespective of dietary intake, accumulation of body fat was uniform both for the main lipid storage and handling organs: large masses of AT (but also liver, muscle), as well as in the ”rest” of tissues. These storage sites, in specialized (adipose) or not-specialized (liver, muscle) tissues reacted in parallel against a hyperlipidic diet challenge. We postulate that body lipid stores are handled and regulated coordinately, with a more centralized and overall mechanisms than usually assumed."

Study Design A decision-analytic model was developed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TVR+PR vs. PR in the United States (US). Methods Patients first moved through the 72-week decision-tree treatment phase of the model and then entered the cyclic Markov post-treatment phase. Clinical data (patient characteristics, SVR rates, and adverse event rates and durations) were obtained from ADVANCE and REALIZE. Health-state transition probabilities, drug and other costs (in 2012/2013 US dollars), and utility values were obtained from the trials, published studies, and publicly available sources. Outcomes were discounted at 3% per year. Results Regardless of treatment history, patients receiving TVR+PR were projected to experience fewer liver-disease complications, more life-years, and more quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) than patients receiving PR. In prior relapsers, TVR+PR was dominant, with lower total medical costs and more QALYs. For the other patient subgroups, incremental costs per QALY gained were between $16,778 (treatment-naïve patients) and $34,279 (prior null responders). Extensive sensitivity analyses confirmed robust model results. Conclusions At standard willingness-to-pay thresholds, TVR+PR represents a cost-effective treatment option compared with PR alone for patients with chronic genotype 1 HCV and compensated liver disease in the US. Future analyses are needed to compare TVR+PR with all existing HCV treatment options."

https://openalex.org/W1970637497,"Background End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) is a worldwide public health problem. Currently, many genome-wide association studies have suggested a potential association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and ESRD by uncovering a causal relationship between HLA and glomerulonephritis. However, previous studies, which investigated the HLA polymorphism and its association with ESRD, were performed with the modest data sets and thus might be limited. On the other hand, few researches were conducted to tackle the Chinese population with ESRD. Therefore, this study aims to detect the susceptibilities of HLA polymorphism to ESRD within the Cantonese community, a representative southern population of China. Methods From the same region, 4541 ESRD patients who were waiting for kidney transplantation and 3744 healthy volunteer bone marrow donors (controls) were randomly chosen for this study. Polymerase chain reaction-sequence specific primer method was used to analyze the HLA polymorphisms (including HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1 loci) in both ESRD patients and controls. The frequencies of alleles at these loci and haplotypes were compared between ESRD patients and controls. Results A total of 88 distinct HLA alleles and 1361 HLA A-B-DRB1 haplotypes were detected. The frequencies of five alleles, HLA-A*24, HLA-B*55, HLA-B*54, HLA-B*40(60), HLA-DRB1*04, and one haplotype (HLA-A*11-B*27-DRB1*04) in ESRD patients are significantly higher than those in the controls, respectively.

Tumor necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) receptor blocking agent etanercept has been proven to be effective in JIA. However, data about the correlation of anti-inflammatory treatment on lipid profiles and atherogenic index in JIA patients remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal changes on lipid profiles and atherogenic index in JIA patients after etanercept treatment. Methods Twenty-three patients diagnosed with JIA (polyarticular type n = 7; oligoarticular type, n = 2; systemic type, n = 10, Enthesitis-related arthritis = 4) received treatment with etanercept during the period 2004–012 in a medical center. We measured their serum lipid profiles at baseline and 2, 4, 6, 12 months later, and determined whether there were differences in complete blood counts, inflammatory mediators, lipid levels and atherogenic indices between patients who had inactive disease (responders) and those who were poor responders (non-responders) to etanercept treatment. Results Analysis of dynamic change in total JIA patients before and after TNF inhibitor therapy showed modest increases in hemoglobin levels (P = 0.02) and decreases in WBC counts, Platelet and CRP levels progressively (p = 0.002, p = 0.006 and p = 0.006, respectively).Twelve of the 23 patients achieved inactive disease status (responders) after 12-months of treatment. In responders, compared to non-responders, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased significantly (P = 0.007,P = 0.044,P<0.001), whereas triglyceride and atherogenic index (TC/HDL-C ratio) significantly decreased (P = 0.04, P = 0.01, respectively) after etanercept treatment. Conclusion Disease severity was associated with triglyceride level, atherogenic index and was inversely associated with total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels and can be improved substantially by using anti TNF-α treatment.

These covalent interactions are catalyzed by a group of ER oxidoreductases: resident proteins that belong to the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family comprising >20 members (4.Ellgaard L.

It is poorly understood why the ER needs so many simultaneously expressed ER oxidoreductases. One possibility is that each oxidoreductase exhibits enzymatic selectivity for the formation of a specific subset of disulfide bonds, or is committed to catalyze a specific type of reaction (4.Ellgaard L.

The best characterized ER oxidoreductases are PDI and ERp57. PDI oxidase and isomerase activities have been demonstrated both in vitro (8.Lyles M.M.

Earlier studies reported that P5 and ERp72 are found in a large multi-enzyme complex that also includes PDI and BiP (17.Meunier L. Usherwood Y.K. Chung K.T.

Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), but subsequent studies have indicated that whereas ERp72 and CaBP1 are associated with BiP (18.Jessop C.E. Watkins R.H. Simmons J.J. Tasab M. Bulleid N.J. Protein disulphide isomerase family members show distinct substrate specificity: P5 is targeted to BiP client proteins.J.

Native thyroglobulin (Tg), the precursor protein for thyroid hormone synthesis, is a homodimeric secretory glycoprotein of 660 kDa (20.Kim P.S.

Tg has several distinct regions bearing multiple independent folding units (22.Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Vito P. Consiglio E. Formisano S.

The N-terminal 1196 amino acids of Tg contain 10 repeating units (type 1 repeats) of ∼60 amino acids with six cysteines engaged in internal Cys1-Cys2, Cys3-Cys4 and Cys5-Cys6 disulfide bonds, a pattern identical to that of other Tg protein family relatives (24.Neumann G.M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 5804-5813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The mid-portion of Tg contains two other types of cysteine-rich domains (type 2 and 3 repeats); it is highly likely that these repeats also use primarily internal disulfide bonds within their respective domain structures, as this mid-portion of the Tg molecule can itself function as a successful secretory protein (23.Lee J. Arvan P. et al.Repeat motif-containing regions within thyroglobulin.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 26327-26333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Finally, the C-terminal cholinesterase-like (ChEL) domain of Tg can also function as a successful secretory protein in its own right (26.Lee J. Di Jeso B.

However, some of the final disulfide loops to form in Tg may potentially involve long stretches of intervening primary sequence, including a few disulfide pairings located within Tg region I (28.Lee J.

The overall disulfide maturation of newly synthesized Tg is quite slow: completion of its oxidative folding requires ∼60 to 90 min (22.Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F. Leonardi A. Vito P.

Thyroglobulin Structure, Function, and Biosynthesis.in: Braverman L.E. Utiger R. The Thyroid. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA2004: 77-95Google Scholar). The slow maturation makes Tg a good substrate in which to study chaperone/oxidoreductase-assisted folding. Multiple ER chaperone proteins, including CRT/CNX (22.Di Jeso B. Ulianich L. Pacifico F.

Moreover, we have observed transient mixed disulfide-linked adducts with endogenous oxidoreductases ERp57 and PDI (30.Di Jeso B. Park Y.N. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S.

Herein, we have definitively identified distinct mixed disulfide-linked adducts between newly synthesized Tg and ER oxidoreductases ERp72 and CaBP1/P5 and provide evidence to suggest that Tg oxidative maturation occurs within these distinct adduct bands, facilitating multidomain disulfide maturation within Tg monomers.

Selected predesigned siRNAs (60 nm; Ambion) specific for ERp72, or P5, or a negative nontargeting control, were mixed with 6 μl of RNAimax Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 0.4 ml of Opti-MEM medium in six-well plates. To each well, 2.5 × 105 PC Cl3 cells in 1.6 ml of Opti-MEM were added and, after 4 h at 37 °C, the medium was supplemented with 1 ml of Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium, calf serum to a final concentration of 5%, and the six hormones mixture to a final 1× concentration. After 3 days, the cells were either directly lysed for Western blot or metabolically labeled with 35S-labeled amino acids for Tg immunoprecipitation as outlined below. Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation were carried out as reported previously (30.Di Jeso B. Park Y.N. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S.

Briefly, for pulse-labeling, PC Cl3 cells were incubated for 30 min in methionine-free, cysteine-free medium, labeled for 15 min (unless otherwise indicated) at 37 °C in the same medium containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine and [35S]methionine labeling mix and either lysed without chase or chased in complete medium with an excess of cold methionine and cysteine. All subsequent manipulations were performed at 4 °C. For DTT washout experiments, PC Cl3 cells were treated with different concentrations of DTT and labeled as outlined above in the presence of DTT at the concentrations indicated. Cells were extensively washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove DTT before chase. At the end of chase, labeled cells were washed with cold PBS containing 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) to alkylate free sulfhydryls. For long term labeling to approach steady state, cells were labeled at 500 μCi/ml pure [35S]methionine for 48 h in complete medium (containing cysteine, methionine, and serum). Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) plus 20 mm NEM. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysates were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the respective antibodies and tumbled with protein A-Sepharose for 3 h. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer (4% SDS, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 20% glycerol, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)) with or without 20 mm dithiothreitol, and the supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For immunoprecipitation in denaturing conditions, cells were labeled, washed, and lysed as described above. One-half of the lysate was immunoprecipitated as described above, and the other half was brought to 5% SDS and boiled for 5 min. The latter samples were then diluted 10-fold with 1% Triton X-100 in 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4). Immunoprecipitates of denatured samples were washed three times with 0.05% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 8.6). For BiP immunoprecipitation, labeled cells were washed with cold PBS containing 20 mm NEM and then three times with PBS alone and lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer plus 20 units/ml apyrase (to enzymatically deplete ATP). After 60 min, cells were processed as described above. Chemical cross-linking in situ was performed as reported previously (33.Muresan Z. Arvan P. et al.Thyroglobulin transport along the secretory pathway. Investigation of the role of molecular chaperone, GRP94, in protein export from the endoplasmic reticulum.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26095-26102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, labeled cells were rinsed with PBS and then incubated for 30 min with 2 mm dithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (DSP) freshly prepared in 90% PBS, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were then rinsed with cold PBS and alkylated with 20 mm NEM. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer plus 20 mm NEM and 50 mm glycine to quench excess cross-linker. Lysates were then processed as described above. For sequential immunoprecipitation, the samples were first immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions and then brought to 5% SDS and boiled for 5 min. The samples were then diluted 10-fold with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and reimmunoprecipitated. For three-step sequential immunoprecipitation, after the second step, samples were brought to 5% SDS and boiled for 5 min. The samples were again diluted 10-fold with 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and reimmunoprecipitated. Quantitation of labeled bands was performed using a PhosphorImager from Molecular Dynamics. 293T were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 42 h of transfection, cells were treated with brefeldin A (5 μg/ml) for 6 h and then cross-linked in situ with 2 mm DSP as above. Cells were then washed in PBS containing 20 mm NEM and lysed as described above. Lysates were precleared with protein A-agarose, immunoprecipitated with anti-Tg, washed twice, and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Newly synthesized Tg can be resolved as multiple species upon nonreducing SDS-PAGE, including Tg monomers (330 kDa) and small amounts of higher molecular mass species termed adduct A (slowest migrating), adduct B, (intermediate mobility), and adduct C (fastest migrating), that appear transiently in pulse-chase experiments. The transient nature of these adducts is unaffected by treatment with proteasome inhibitors, suggesting that they are not primarily misfolded forms destined for endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation but rather intermolecular adducts captured in the process of Tg intramolecular disulfide maturation (30.Di Jeso B. Park Y.N. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S. Arvan P. et al.Mixed-disulfide folding intermediates between thyroglobulin and endoplasmic reticulum resident oxidoreductases ERp57 and protein disulfide isomerase.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9793-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These adducts are fully dissociated under reducing conditions, and subcomponents of adduct B have been shown to contain Tg-ERp57 and Tg-PDI complexes (30.Di Jeso B. Park Y.N. Ulianich L. Treglia A.S. Urbanas M.L. High S. Arvan P. et al.Mixed-disulfide folding intermediates between thyroglobulin and endoplasmic reticulum resident oxidoreductases ERp57 and protein disulfide isomerase.Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 9793-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To study initial disulfide-linked adduct formation, we analyzed the folding of Tg in a pulse-chase protocol in which initial oxidation in cultured thyrocytes (PC Cl3 cells) was inhibited during translation by the presence of various concentrations of dithiothreitol (DTT), followed by DTT washout. Upon metabolic labeling in the presence of either 0.5 or 0.75 mm DTT, no fully oxidized Tg could be recovered at the zero chase time but slowly appeared at 30 and 60 min of chase (Fig. 1A). However, washout of 0.5 or 0.75 mm DTT promoted Tg aggregation (bands entrapped in the stacking gel or just barely entering the running gel), which did not fully resolve even at 1 h of chase (Fig. 1A). Moreover, upon DTT washout, adduct species A and B appeared but with little or no formation of adduct C. Clearly, Tg folding was seriously perturbed by translation in these presence of these doses of DTT. By contrast, washout of a lower concentration of DTT (0.3 mm) allowed post-translational Tg oxidation to proceed near-normally: without disulfide-linked protein aggregates, with recovery of typical Tg adducts A, B, and C and with an increase in the overall recovery of labeled Tg (Fig. 1A). Indeed, low-dose DTT looked similar to chase samples that were pulse-labeled without DTT except that all Tg adducts formed post-translationally (Fig. 1B). Thus, low-dose DTT, which blocked initial formation of Tg disulfide bonds, also blocked initial production of Tg adducts, and the appearance of adducts upon DTT washout correlated with intramolecular oxidative folding of Tg monomers (Fig. 1B). Still lower concentrations of DTT (0.2 mm) allowed for the co-translational formation of Tg adducts (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, during the first 5 min after DTT washout from these conditions, the position of species A on the nonreducing gel notably shifted (Fig. 1C); bands B and C also showed small increases in their mobilities between 2.5 and 5 min of chase (Fig. 1C). We looked for evidence of a precursor-product relationships between the adduct species. After pulse-labeling in the presence of 0.3 mm DTT to reduce Tg, followed by short chase times to track the earliest post-translational formation of adducts, we observed initial oxidation of the 330-kDa Tg band within 1 min after DTT washout as disulfide-linked adducts A, B, and C first appeared (Fig. 2). Importantly, beginning at 2.5 min of chase, in parallel with oxidation of the 330-kDa Tg monomer band, each of the Tg adducts also showed an increase in their mobility (Fig. 2). A shift in mobility of adducts A, B, and C persisted even after removal of all N-linked glycans with PNGase F (data not shown). The data in Fig. 2 do not support a strict precursor-product relationship between adducts A, B, and C but suggest progression in the early oxidation of Tg within each of the adducts. We incubated PC Cl3 cells with 35S-labeled amino acids for 48 h to label slow turnover ER resident proteins and immunoprecipitated Tg. To capture disulfide-linked Tg adducts, we ran a first-dimensional gel under nonreducing conditions and excised the individual adduct bands from the gel. Each band was then reanalyzed in a second dimensional gel under reducing conditions. Of course, each adduct regenerated a reduced 330-kDa Tg monomer under reducing conditions (the first-dimensional 330-kDa Tg oxidized band also regenerated a reduced 330-kDa reduced band, Fig. 3, last lane). In addition, each adduct preferentially released formerly disulfide-associated bands of molecular mass ∼ 75, 59, and 50 kDa (asterisk, Fig. 3). As noted above, these bands are candidate ER oxidoreductases bound via transient mixed disulfide bonds to newly synthesized Tg. Indeed, we have already demonstrated that species B has two subcom"
https://openalex.org/W1986578550,"Protein-protein interactions are driving forces in cellular processes. As a prime example, transmembrane integrins link extracellular matrix and intracellular proteins, resulting in bidirectional signaling that regulates cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Here we provide the first evidence that interaction between the integrin β1 cytoplasmic tail and kindlin-2, a member of a family of adapters implicated in human disease pathogenesis, is mainly governed by the β1 C-terminal carboxylate moiety and is required for laterality organ development in zebrafish. Affinity measurements indicate that this unusual protein-protein interaction mode is coordinated by a putative carboxylate-binding motif in the kindlin-2 FERM subdomain F3. Contrary to the C terminus of proteins that engage PDZ domains, the C-terminal three residues of β1, per se, do not contribute to kindlin-2 binding or to laterality organ development. Thus, by employing zebrafish as an in situ physiological tool to correlate protein structure and function, we have discovered an unexpected association chemistry between an integrin and a key adapter involved in integrin signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2008078637,"Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest early nutrition has long-term effects on susceptibility to obesity, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Small and large animal models confirm the influence of different windows of sensitivity, from fetal to early postnatal life, on offspring phenotype. We showed previously that undernutrition in sheep either during the first month of gestation or immediately after weaning induces differential, sex-specific changes in adult metabolic and cardiovascular systems. The current study aims to determine metabolic and molecular changes that underlie differences in lipid and glucose metabolism induced by undernutrition during specific developmental periods in male and female sheep. Ewes received 100% (C) or 50% nutritional requirements (U) from 1-31 days gestation, and 100% thereafter. From weaning (12 weeks) to 25 weeks, offspring were then fed either ad libitum (CC, UC) or were undernourished (CU, UU) to reduce body weight to 85% of their individual target. From 25 weeks, all offspring were fed ad libitum. A cohort of late gestation fetuses were studied after receiving either 40% nutritional requirements (1-31 days gestation) or 50% nutritional requirements (104-127 days gestation). Post-weaning undernutrition increased in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin receptor and glucose transporter 4 expression in muscle, and lowered hepatic methylation at the delta-like homolog 1/maternally expressed gene 3 imprinted cluster in adult females, but not males. Early gestational undernutrition induced lower hepatic expression of gluconeogenic factors in fetuses and reduced in vivo adipose tissue insulin sensitivity in adulthood. In males, undernutrition in early gestation increased adipose tissue lipid handling mechanisms (lipoprotein lipase, glucocorticoid receptor expression) and hepatic methylation within the imprinted control region of insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor in adulthood. Therefore, undernutrition during development induces changes in mechanisms of lipid and glucose metabolism which differ between tissues and sexes dependent on the period of nutritional restriction. Such changes may increase later life obesity and dyslipidaemia risk."
https://openalex.org/W2170780059,"Some of the fascinating features of voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) in voltage-gated cation channels (VGCCs) are their modular nature and adaptability. Here we examined the VSD sensitivity of different VGCCs to 2 structurally related nontoxin gating modifiers, NH17 and NH29, which stabilize Kv7.2 potassium channels in the closed and open states, respectively. The effects of NH17 and NH29 were examined in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) or Kv7.2 channels, as well as in dorsal root ganglia neurons, using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. NH17 and NH29 exert opposite effects on TRPV1 channels, operating, respectively, as an activator and a blocker of TRPV1 currents (EC50 and IC50 values ranging from 4 to 40 μM). Combined mutagenesis, electrophysiology, structural homology modeling, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulation indicate that both compounds target the VSDs of TRPV1 channels, which, like vanilloids, are involved in π-π stacking, H-bonding, and hydrophobic interactions. Reflecting their promiscuity, the drugs also affect the lone VSD proton channel mV-SOP. Thus, the same gating modifier can promiscuously interact with different VGCCs, and subtle differences at the VSD-ligand interface will dictate whether the gating modifier stabilizes channels in either the closed or the open state.—Kornilov, P., Peretz, A., Lee, Y., Son, K., Lee, J.

https://openalex.org/W2026992927,"Highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) had caused catastrophic losses in swine industry in China. The current inactivated vaccine provided only limited protection, and the attenuated live vaccine could protect piglets against the HP-PRRSV but there was a possibility that the attenuated virus returned to high virulence. In this study, the eukaryotic expression vector pVAX1© was modified under the control of rabbit β-globin intron II gene and the modified vector pMVAX1© was constructed. Porcine interleukin-2 (IL-2) and GP3-GP5 fusion protein of HP-PRRSV strain SD-JN were highly expressed by pMVAX1©. Mice inoculated with pMVAX1©-GP35 developed significantly higher PRRSV-specific antibody responses and T cell proliferation than those vaccinated with pVAX1©-GP35. pMVAX1©-GP35 was selected as PRRS DNA vaccine candidate and co-administrated with pVAX1©-IL-2 or pMVAX1©-IL-2 in pigs. pMVAX1©-IL-2+pMVAX1©-GP35 could provide enhanced PRRSV-specific antibody responses, T cell proliferation, Th1-type and Th2-type cytokine responses and CTL responses than pMVAX1©-GP35 and pVAX1©-IL-2+pMVAX1©-GP35. Following homologous challenge with HP-PRRSV strain SD-JN, similar with attenuated PRRS vaccine group, pigs inoculated with pMVAX1©-IL-2+pMVAX1©-GP35 showed no clinical signs, almost no lung lesions and no viremia, as compared to those in pMVAX1©-GP35 and pVAX1©-IL-2+pMVAX1©-GP35 groups. It indicated that pMVAX1©-IL-2 effectively increases humoral and cell mediated immune responses of pMVAX1©-GP35. Co-administration of pMVAX1©-IL-2 and pMVAX1©-GP35 might be attractive candidate vaccines for preventing HP-PRRSV infections."
https://openalex.org/W1998647377,"Geographic distance and geographical barriers likely play a considerable role in structuring genetic variation in species, although some migratory species may have less phylogeographic structure on a smaller spatial scale. Here, genetic diversity and the phylogenetic structure among geographical populations of the yellow-spined bamboo locust, Ceracris kiangsu, were examined with 16S rDNA and amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs). In this study, no conspicuous phylogeographical structure was discovered from either Maximum parsimony (MP) and Neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic analyses. The effect of geographical isolation was not conspicuous on a large spatial scale.At smaller spatial scales local diversity of some populations within mountainous areas were detected using Nei's genetic distance and AMOVA. There is a high level of genetic diversity and a low genetic differentiation among populations in the C. kiangsu of South and Southeast China. Our analyses indicate that C. kiangsu is a monophyletic group. Our results also support the hypothesis that the C. kiangsu population is in a primary differentiation stage. Given the mismatch distribution, it is likely that a population expansion in C. kiangsu occurred about 0.242 Ma during the Quaternary interglaciation. Based on historical reports, we conjecture that human activities had significant impacts on the C. kiangsu gene flow."
https://openalex.org/W1969888848,"Background Countries face conflicting incentives to report infectious disease outbreaks. Reports of outbreaks can prompt other countries to impose trade and travel restrictions, which has the potential to discourage reporting. However, reports can also bring medical assistance to contain the outbreak, including access to vaccines. Methods We compiled data on reports of meningococcal meningitis to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 54 African countries between 1966 and 2002, a period is marked by two events: first, a large outbreak reported from many countries in 1987 associated with the Hajj that resulted in more stringent requirements for meningitis vaccination among pilgrims; and second, another large outbreak in Sub-Saharan Africa in 1996 that led to a new international mechanism to supply vaccines to countries reporting a meningitis outbreak. We used fixed-effects regression modeling to statistically estimate the effect of external forcing events on the number of countries reporting cases of meningitis to WHO. Findings We find that the Hajj vaccination requirements started in 1988 were associated with reduced reporting, especially among countries with relatively fewer cases reported between 1966 and 1979. After the vaccine provision mechanism was in place in 1996, reporting among countries that had previously not reported meningitis outbreaks increased. Interpretation These results indicate that countries may respond to changing incentives to report outbreaks when they can do so. In the long term, these incentives are likely to be more important than surveillance assistance in prompt reporting of outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2060723456,"Perineuronal nets (PNNs) accumulate around neurons near the end of developmental critical periods. PNNs are structures of the extracellular matrix which surround synaptic contacts and contain chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Previous studies suggest that the chondroitin sulfate chains of PNNs inhibit synaptic plasticity and thereby help end critical periods. PNNs surround a high proportion of neurons in the cerebellar nuclei. These PNNs form during approximately the same time that movements achieve normal accuracy. It is possible that PNNs in the cerebellar nuclei inhibit plasticity to maintain the synaptic organization that produces those accurate movements. We tested whether or not PNNs in a saccade-related part of the cerebellar nuclei maintain accurate saccade size by digesting a part of them in an adult monkey performing a task that changes saccade size (long term saccade adaptation). We use the enzyme Chondroitinase ABC to digest the glycosaminoglycan side chains of proteoglycans present in the majority of PNNs. We show that this manipulation does not result in faster, larger, or more persistent adaptation. Our result indicates that intact perineuronal nets around saccade-related neurons in the cerebellar nuclei are not important for maintaining long-term saccade gain."
https://openalex.org/W2088985757,"Some years ago, we showed that thermo-chemically denatured, partially-unfolded forms of Pyrococcus furiosus triosephosphateisomerase (PfuTIM) display cold-denaturation upon cooling, and heat-renaturation upon reheating, in proportion with the extent of initial partial unfolding achieved. This was the first time that cold-denaturation was demonstrated for a hyperthermophile protein, following unlocking of surface salt bridges. Here, we describe the behavior of another hyperthermophile protein, the small, monomeric, 53 residues-long rubredoxin from Pyrococcus furiosus (PfRd), which is one of the most thermostable proteins known to man. Like PfuTIM, PfRd too displays cold-denaturation after initial thermo-chemical perturbation, however, with two differences: (i) PfRd requires considerably higher temperatures as well as higher concentrations of guanidium hydrochloride (Gdm.HCl) than PfuTIM; (ii) PfRd's cold-denaturation behavior during cooling after thermo-chemical perturbation is incompletely reversible, unlike PfuTIM's, which was clearly reversible (from each different conformation generated). Differential cold-denaturation treatments allow PfRd to access multiple partially-unfolded states, each of which is clearly highly kinetically-stable. We refer to these as 'Trishanku' unfolding intermediates (or TUIs). Fascinatingly, refolding of TUIs through removal of Gdm.HCl generates multiple partially-refolded, monomeric, kinetically-trapped, non-native 'Trishanku' refolding intermediates (or TRIs), which differ from each other and from native PfRd and TUIs, in structural content and susceptibility to proteolysis. We find that the occurrence of cold denaturation and observations of TUI and TRI states is contingent on the oxidation status of iron, with redox agents managing to modulate the molecule's behavior upon gaining access to PfRd's iron atom. Mass spectrometric examination provides no evidence of the formation of disulfide bonds, but other experiments suggest that the oxidation status of iron (and its extent of burial) together determine whether or not PfRd shows cold denaturation, and also whether redox agents are able to modulate its behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2125731345,"The hypoxia-inducible factors HIF-1α or HIF-2α form heterodimeric complexes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT). HIF-1α/ARNT and HIF-2α/ARNT complexes activate hypoxia-inducible genes that play critical roles in angiogenesis, anaerobic metabolism, and other processes in response to O2 deprivation. HIF-2α is known to regulate the function and/or differentiation of stem cells by activating the POU domain transcription factor Oct4; however, the precise underlying mechanism is unknown. This study examined the role of HIF-2α/ARNT in hair development using conditional-knockout mice, in which Arnt was specifically deleted in keratinocytes. In wild-type mice, HIF-2α and ARNT were highly expressed in the precortex above the hair matrix, an area containing differentiating stem cells. An analysis of hair size and type in these mice showed that loss of ARNT decreased the production of zigzag hairs, corresponding to reduced expression of HIF-2α and induction of the mammalian cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Waf1/Cip1) and p27 (Kip1). The results suggest that the HIF-2α/ARNT complex regulates hair follicle differentiation via induction of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and possibly p27(Kip1), as p27(Kip1) expression was not altered in ARNT knockout mice. The findings provide insight into a possible mechanism underlying hair growth disorders and can be useful for future studies on hair follicle response to insults, such as chemotherapy and ionizing radiation."
https://openalex.org/W1984633843,"We previously reported that the intronic tagSNP +357G/C in the metastasis suppressor HTPAP is associated with metastasis and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of this study was to investigate whether SNPs in the HTPAP promoter modulate HTPAP expression and prognosis of HCC. Genomic DNA from 572 microdissected HCCs were genotyped by pyrosequencing and verified by direct sequencing. Haplotype blocks were analyzed. Reporter plasmids were constructed and transfected into HCC cell lines. Transcriptional activities of plasmids were analyzed by dual-luciferase reporter systems. HTPAP expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR, western blots, and tissue microarrays. Invasion was assessed by Matrigel assays. The prognostic values of HTPAP promoter SNPs in HCC were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. We identified six SNPs, including -1053A/G and +64G/C, in the HTPAP promoter. The SNPs were in complete linkage disequilibrium, resulting in three promoter haplotypes (promoter I:-1053AA/+64GG, promoter II: -1053AG/+64GC, and promoter III: -1053GG/+64CC). Promoter I manifested the highest luciferase index (p<0.005). However, no significant difference was observed between promoters II and III. We consistently found that HTPAP mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in promoter I than that of promoter II+III (p<0.001). Invasion was increased in HCC cells transfected with promoters II+III compared to those transfected with promoter I (p<0.05). The HTPAP promoter II+III haplotype was associated with significantly increased metastasis compared to that of promoter I (p = 0.023). The postoperative five-year overall survival of patients with promoters II+III was lower than that of patients with promoter I (p = 0.006). Multivariate analysis showed that the promoter II+III haplotype was an adverse prognostic marker in HCC. The genetic variants at loci –1053 and +64 of the HTPAP promoter affect the expression of HTPAP, which might be a novel determinant and target for HCC prognosis."
