https://openalex.org/W1971145588,"It is generally assumed that a specific ubiquitin ligase (E3) links protein substrates to polyubiquitin chains containing a single type of isopeptide linkage, and that chains composed of linkages through Lys(48), but not through Lys(63), target proteins for proteasomal degradation. However, when we carried out a systematic analysis of the types of ubiquitin (Ub) chains formed by different purified E3s and Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2s), we found, using Ub mutants and mass spectrometry, that the U-box E3, CHIP, and Ring finger E3s, MuRF1 and Mdm2, with the E2, UbcH5, form a novel type of Ub chain that contains all seven possible linkages, but predominantly Lys(48), Lys(63), and Lys(11) linkages. Also, these heterogeneous chains contain forks (bifurcations), where two Ub molecules are linked to the adjacent lysines at Lys(6) + Lys(11), Lys(27) + Lys(29), or Lys(29) + Lys(33) on the preceding Ub molecule. However, the HECT domain E3s, E6AP and Nedd4, with the same E2, UbcH5, form homogeneous chains exclusively, either Lys(48) chains (E6AP) or Lys(63) chains (Nedd4). Furthermore, with other families of E2s, CHIP and MuRF1 synthesize homogeneous Ub chains on the substrates. Using the dimeric E2, UbcH13/Uev1a, they attach Lys(63) chains, but with UbcH1 (E2-25K), MuRF1 synthesizes Lys(48) chains on the substrate. We then compared the capacity of the forked heterogeneous chains and homogeneous chains to support proteasomal degradation. When troponin I was linked by MuRF1 to a Lys(48)-Ub chain or, surprisingly, to a Lys(63)-Ub chain, troponin I was degraded rapidly by pure 26S proteasomes. However, when linked to the mixed forked chains, troponin I was degraded quite poorly, and its polyUb chain, especially the forked linkages, was disassembled slowly by proteasome-associated isopeptidases. Because these Ring finger and U-box E3s with UbcH5 target proteins for degradation in vivo, but Lys(63) chains do not, cells probably contain additional factors that prevent formation of such nondegradable Ub-conjugates and that protect proteins linked to Lys(63)-Ub chains from proteasomal degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2139458634,"We have shown that Wnt5A increases the motility of melanoma cells. To explore cellular pathways involving Wnt5A, we compared gain-of-function (WNT5A stable transfectants) versus loss-of-function (siRNA knockdown) of WNT5A by microarray analysis. Increasing WNT5A suppressed the expression of several genes, which were re-expressed after small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of WNT5A. Genes affected by WNT5A include KISS-1, a metastasis suppressor, and CD44, involved in tumor cell homing during metastasis. This could be validated at the protein level using both small interference RNA and recombinant Wnt5A (rWnt5A). Among the genes up-regulated by WNT5A was the gene vimentin, associated with an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), which involves decreases in E-cadherin, due to up-regulation of the transcriptional repressor, Snail. rWnt5A treatment increases Snail and vimentin expression, and decreases E-cadherin, even in the presence of dominant-negativeTCF4, suggesting that this activation is independent of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Because Wnt5A can signal via protein kinase C (PKC), the role of PKC in Wnt5A-mediated motility and EMT was also assessed using PKC inhibition and activation studies. Treating cells expressing low levels of Wnt5A with phorbol ester increased Snail expression inhibiting PKC in cells expressing high levels of Wnt5A decreased Snail. Furthermore, inhibition of PKC before Wnt5A treatment blocked Snail expression, implying that Wnt5A can potentiate melanoma metastasis via the induction of EMT in a PKC-dependent manner.

The molecular mechanisms that govern the motility and metastasis of melanoma cells are not well understood. The prognosis for patients with recurrent melanoma has shown no improvement over the past 50 years. Many of these tumors are histopathologically quite similar but can be subclassified based upon their gene expression profiles (1Bittner M. Meltzer P. Chen Y. Jiang Y. Seftor E. Hendrix M.

Nature. 2000; 406: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (1309) Google Scholar). In a study by Bittner et al. (1Bittner M. Meltzer P. Chen Y. Jiang Y. Seftor E. Hendrix M. Radmacher M. Simon R. Yakhini Z. Ben-Dor A. Sampas N. Dougherty E. Wang E. Marincola F. Gooden C. Lueders J. Glatfelter A. Pollock P. Carpten J. Gillanders E. Leja D. Dietrich K. Beaudry C. Berens M. Alberts D. Sondak V. Nature. 2000; 406: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), the gene that best separated highly aggressive tumors from less aggressive tumors was WNT5A, which was consistently underexpressed in the less motile tumors. Wnt5A is a member of the Wnt family of proteins, which were first identified during studies of development in Drosophila (3McMahon A.P. Moon R.T. Development. 1989; 107: 161-167PubMed Google Scholar) and in studies of the mouse mammary tumor virus (4Nusse R. van Ooyen A. Rijsewijk F. van Lohuizen M. Schuuring E. van't Veer L. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1985; 226: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Unlike its family members Wnt1 and Wnt3A, which signal via the canonical Wnt pathway, resulting in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, Wnt5A acts via G-protein-coupled receptors to activate protein kinase C (PKC) 6The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; siRNA, small interference RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PMA, 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; CAMKII, calmodulin-dependent kinase II; r, recombinant; EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition; NFAT, nuclear factor of activating T-cells; dn, dominant negative; MMP-2, matrix-metalloproteinase-2. and intracellular calcium (5Sheldahl L.C.

The interplay between these two pathways is not well understood, but it does appear that the non-canonical Wnt pathway can inhibit β-catenin stabilization both in vitro in human HEK293 cells and in vivo in zebrafish (7Westfall T.A.

In melanoma cells with low motility and low expression of WNT5A, overexpressing WNT5A resulted in an increase in both the activation of PKC and an increase in motility (9Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). High expression of WNT5A in melanoma patients also correlated to poor outcome in this study. In addition, many studies have highlighted the importance of G-protein-mediated signaling and the resultant activation of PKC and increases in intracellular calcium, in melanoma progression (10Parker C. Sherbet G.V. Melanoma Res. 1992; 2: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Li S. Huang S. Peng S.B. Int. J. Oncol. 2005; 27: 1329-1339PubMed Google Scholar, 12Fink-Puches R. Helige C. Kerl H. Smolle J. Tritthart H.A. Exp. Dermatol. 1993; 2: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Serial analysis of gene expression in melanoma samples has also confirmed this observation, and specifically, genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway are also expressed in these libraries, including WNT10A, FRIZZLED7, and junction plakoglobin (13Weeraratna A.T. Becker D. Carr K.M. Duray P.H. Rosenblatt K.P. Yang S. Chen Y. Bittner M. Strausberg R.L. Riggins G.J. Wagner U. Kallioniemi O.P. Trent J.M. Morin P.J. Meltzer P.S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2264-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To further explore our previous results concerning the effects of Wnt5A and PKC on melanoma cells, as well as to better dissect the mechanisms by which Wnt5A might be affecting motility in melanoma, we used siRNA technology to knock down WNT5A expression, and then assayed gene expression changes using microarray analysis. We subsequently validated these results using a combination of recombinant Wnt5A and WNT5A siRNA treatments, as well as PKC activation and inhibition studies. This approach allows us to identify a subset of genes specifically affected by Wnt5A signaling and provides us with insights as to how Wnt5A is mediating motility in melanoma cells. Cell Lines—The human melanoma cell line UACC1273, and its subclones UACC-1273EV, UACC1273-4-3, and UACC12734-7, as well the cell lines UACC647, M93-047, and UACC-903, were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, and G361 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium. All media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 units of streptomycin. All cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air, and the medium was replaced every second day. Transfections and Treatments—siRNA was designed using Qiagen online design tools, which designs 21-nucleotide siRNA according to the Tuschl rules of siRNA design. Three siRNAs were designed as described in the text and purchased from Qiagen in both rhodamine-tagged and untagged forms. Rhodamine-tagged and untagged control siRNAs were also purchased from Qiagen. These siRNAs were transfected into cells (60-70% confluency) using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were allowed to reach 60-70% confluency within 48 h of seeding. After 6 h of transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh serum-containing medium. Transfection efficiencies are usually upwards of 90% for siRNA oligonucleotides as gauged by transfection with rhodamine-tagged siRNAs. For confocal microscopy the rhodamine-tagged siRNAs were diluted 1:3 with untagged siRNAs so that the fluorescence would not be overwhelming. For the dominant negative TCF4 vector (a generous gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, Baltimore, MD), transfection efficiencies are usually around 75%, as gauged by simultaneous GFP transfection. Interestingly, transfection efficiency is highly dependent on melanoma cell confluency, and cell densities higher than 80% result in inefficient transfection. These data are available from the authors upon request. For recombinant Wnt5A treatments, recombinant Wnt5A was obtained from R&D systems, and reconstituted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin to a stock concentration of 10 μg/ml. After testing a range of concentrations, and time points, a concentration of 0.1-0.2 μg/ml for 12-16 h in serum-free medium was decided upon, because by 24 h the recombinant protein starts to lose activity in the media. According to the R&D Systems measurements, which assess Wnt5A activity by its ability to inhibit Wnt3A activity, Wnt3A activity is 5 times higher than that of Wnt5A, thus cells were treated at a concentration 0.04 μg/ml for the same time points. For PKC inhibition studies, a range of times, concentrations, and inhibitors was tested, and ultimately, Gö6983 (a specific inhibitor of PKC α, β, γ, δ, and ζ, but not μ) and GF 109203X (inhibitor of PKC α, β, δ, and ϵ) were used in an attempt to use two different inhibitors of the conventional PKC pathway, at concentrations of 1 μm each. Cells were either pre-treated with the inhibitor for 1 h for Western analysis, or 12 h for wound healing assays, then treated with recombinant Wnt5A as described above, in the continuing presence of inhibitor, or treated with inhibitor alone for the indicated times. For PKC activation studies, phorbol ester, specifically, 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was used at 200 nm. For vehicle controls, cells were treated with equivalent amounts of Me2SO. Wound Healing Assays—Wound healing assays were performed by plating cells in plates coated with fibronectin or collagen IV. After cells were allowed to attach and reach confluency, a scratch was made through the confluent monolayer using a sterile pipette tip. Photographs of cells invading the scratch were taken at the indicated time points. All cell lines were assayed in triplicate, in each experiment, and each experiment was repeated three times. Microarray Analysis—RNA was extracted from cells in culture and concentrated to 3.6 μg/μl using a Micron-100, and a total of 50 μg was used for array analysis. RNA was bound to anchored oligonucleotide-deoxythymidine for 5 min at 75 °C, and cooled to 42 °C. Oligonucleotides and Cy dyes were added, as well as reverse transcriptase, and the reaction was carried out for 1 h. Samples were hydrolyzed with 0.5 m EDTA and 1 m NaOH for 15 min at 65 °C. NaOH was neutralized using an equal volume of 1 m HCl, and then the probe was purified by running it through the Qiagen PCR purification kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol, with the exception of the addition of a 35% guanidium-HCl wash prior to the PE buffer wash step. Cy-3 probes and Cy-5 probes were combined at this point and dried in a lyophilizer. Dried probes were resuspended in Agilent hybridization buffer according to the manufacturer's protocol and applied to the microarray slides overnight. The slides used were customized Agilent cDNA arrays. After hybridization, slides were washed for 2 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature with a final rinse in 0.05× SSC at room temperature. Fluorescence images were obtained using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner, and images were analyzed using IPLAB microarray suite. Gene intensities were background subtracted (taking the mean of channel intensities and median of background). After normalization, ratios of red to green intensity were used to generate a multidimensional scaling diagram and perform gene selection among classes, based on linear discriminant analysis, as previously described (1Bittner M. Meltzer P. Chen Y. Jiang Y. Seftor E. Hendrix M. Radmacher M. Simon R. Yakhini Z. Ben-Dor A. Sampas N. Dougherty E. Wang E. Marincola F. Gooden C. Lueders J. Glatfelter A. Pollock P. Carpten J. Gillanders E. Leja D. Dietrich K. Beaudry C. Berens M. Alberts D. Sondak V. Nature. 2000; 406: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). To evaluate the probability of a given gene achieving a significant weight by chance, a random permutation test using 1000 permutations was used to generate an empirical significance threshold for comparison with the calculated p value for each gene. These analyses were performed using the NHGRI, NIH in-house suite of web-based array analysis tools. Western Blotting—Sources of antibody and concentrations used are as follows: Phospho-Pan-PKC antibody (1:1,000), Phospho-CaMKII antibody (1:500), CaMKII antibody (1:500), and β-catenin antibody (1:1,000) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Wnt5A antibody (1:100) was obtained from R&D Biosystems (Minneapolis, MN). KISS1 antibody (1:100), Snail antibody (1:100), and Tubulin antibody (1:2,000) were obtained from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). E-Cadherin antibody (1:1,000) and antibodies to non-phosphorylated PKC isoforms were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA). Cells were grown to 80% confluency and then harvested on ice using cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were Dounce-homogenized and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was quantitated using the Pierce BCA protein quantitation assay. 50 μg of each lysate was run out on SDS-PAGE 10% Tris-glycine NuPAGE gels and transferred onto 0.2-μm nitrocellulose. The membranes were probed with antibodies and then visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Phosphatase Assays—Protein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as described above, and transferred on to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Samples were run in duplicate sets on a single gel, and the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was cut into two. One-half of the membrane (one set of samples) was incubated in buffer (0.1 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.5, 0.2 mm EDTA) containing alkaline phosphatase (20 units/ml), according to the protocol described by Maya et al. (16Maya R. Oren M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3213-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and both membranes were blocked and probed with antibody against PKC α, β, or γ or CAMKII as described above. Gelatin Zymography—The activity of MMP-2 in the culture medium of cells was assessed using gelatin zymography. Cells were plated at equal density in 10-centimeter tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow to ∼60% confluency, at which point they were either treated with PMA or PKC inhibitor (Gö6983 or GF 109203X) in serum-free, phenol red-free medium. Medium was concentrated using Centriplus YM-10 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). 30 μg of protein was separated in non-reducing conditions on a 10% zymogram gel containing 0.1% gelatin (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, gels were incubated in zymogram-renaturing buffer at room temperature for 30 min to remove the SDS followed by a 24- to 48-h incubation at 37 °C in the zymogram developing buffer (Invitrogen). Gels were then stained for 2 h in 30% methanol, 10% glacial acetic acid, and 0.25% Coomassie Blue and destained for 4 h in 10% methanol/10% glacial acetic acid. Clear bands appear on the Coomassie-stained blue background in the areas of gelatinolytic activity. Experiments were repeated with at least four independent sets of culture medium. Real-time PCR Analysis—Primers were designed for use with the PerkinElmer Life Sciences 5700 system. Primers were designed to generate products of less than 200 bp, for efficient analysis and are listed as follows: vimentin, forward 5′-ATTCCACTTTGCGTTCAAGG-3′; reverse 5′-CTTCAGAGAGAGGAAGCCGA-3′; SNAIL, forward 5′-AGGTTGGAGCGGTCAGC-3′, reverse 5′-CCTTCTCTAGGCCCTGGCT-3′. cDNA was transcribed from 1 μg of total RNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and 200 ng of this cDNA was used in the real-time reverse transcription-PCR reaction. Samples were normalized against the 18 S gene, using universal 18 S primers (Ambion, Austin, TX) and the ratio of signal to 18 S, and the -fold increase as compared with melanocyte controls was calculated using the calculation 2-ΔΔCT according to the manufacturer's protocol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on glass slides and allowed to reach 80% confluency (note that transfections were performed at 60% confluency, as mentioned before). They were then fixed using 95% methanol and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. Nuclei were permeabilized by incubating the cells in 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4, calcium and magnesium free) for 10 min. Slides were washed and then blocked with immunofluorescence blocking buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.2% casein, 0.2% gelatin, 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h, followed by an overnight at 4 °C incubation. Primary antibodies used include: vimentin (1:50, Abcam Inc.), Snail (1:100, Abcam Inc.), E-cadherin (1:50, BD Biosciences), and CD44 and MMP-2 (1:50, R&D Systems). The cells were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min. They were then probed with Alexafluor 488 and 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed, mounted in Prolong gold anti-fade (Molecular Probes), and examined under fluorescence and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). CD44 experiments were imaged using a light microscope (Zeiss Axiovert 200). siRNA sequences were analyzed using the BLAST data base to ensure that they would specifically target Wnt5A, and sequences from three different regions of the gene were synthesized (Fig. 1A). The efficacy of each of these siRNA sequences was first tested using Western analysis for Wnt5A in an endogenously high Wnt5A melanoma line, M93-047 (Fig. 1B). The most efficient sequence, A2, was also used to decrease Wnt5A in a melanoma cell line that had been stably transfected with WNT5A (UACC1273-4-7), and both M93-047 cells, and the UACC1273-4-7 cells were stained for expression of the Wnt5A protein, using immunofluorescent detection (Fig. 1c). Finally, cells were transfected with Wnt5A-A2 siRNA for 24 and 48 h and then subjected to a wound healing assay. Both M93-047 and UACC903 melanoma cells (with endogenously high Wnt5A levels), whether untreated, or transfected with a control siRNA were able to close a wound by 12 and 24 h, respectively. However, cells treated with Wnt5A-A2 siRNA had not yet closed a scratch wound in this time, confirming that WNT5A knockdown resulted in a decrease in melanoma cell motility (Fig. 1D). Because Wnt5A has been shown to increase the phosphorylation of PKC (9Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), all three sequences were tested for their ability to inhibit PKC phosphorylation. We have previously shown that the PKC isoforms affected by Wnt5A are predominantly PKCα,-β, and -γ (9Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), and their phosphorylation status can be assessed using a Pan-PO4-PKC antibody (Cell Signaling). All three siRNAs were independently transfected into either empty vector-transfected melanoma cells (UACC1273EV), endogenously low in Wnt5A (Wnt5Alow) or into the same parental cells stably transfected with WNT5A (UACC1273-4-7). The A2 sequence was the most efficient at inhibiting PKC phosphorylation in the WNT5A transfectants (Wnt5Atfx), without affecting the Wnt5Alow cells dramatically (Fig. 2A). M93-047 cells (Wnt5Ahigh) also showed significant decreases in the amount of phosphorylated PKC when treated with WNT5A siRNA-A2 (Fig. 2A). To further ascertain deactivation of PKC, we investigated whether PKC translocated from its active site at the membrane of the cell, upon inhibition of Wnt5A. To perform this experiment, we examined the conventional PKC, PKCβII. Cells were transiently transfected with a GFP-tagged PKCβII vector and rhodamine-tagged control siRNA and examined using confocal microscopy. M93-047 cells with endogenously high Wnt5A (Wnt5Ahigh) showed PKCβII expression predominantly at the membrane (Fig. 2B). Some cells did exhibit cytoplasmic staining, but this accounted for only ∼20% of the transfected cells. When cells were transfected with GFP-PKCβII and rhodamine-tagged siRNA-A2 (Wnt5A-A2Rh) against Wnt5A (Fig. 2c), GFP-PKCβII moved from the membrane into the cytoplasm. Although the vast majority of cells had cytoplasmic staining, again a small percentage (in this case around 10%) of cells had both cytoplasmic and membrane staining. Levels of total PKC (Fig. 2D, PKC all) were unaffected by WNT5A siRNA, when using a mixture of PKC isoform antibodies (BD Biosciences). However, when using a mix of antibodies against only the isoforms affected by Wnt5A, α, β, and γ, we observed that levels of these isoforms increased dramatically (Fig. 2D, PKCα,-β, and -γ), whereas levels of the phosphorylated protein decreased. The same observation was made when we examined the expression and phosphorylation status of calmodulindependent kinase II (CAMKII), a kinase known to be activated due to Ca2+ release upon Wnt5A binding (14Kuhl M. Sheldahl L.C. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12701-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Activation of CAMKII is dependent upon phosphorylation at the Thr286 residue (15Chin D. Means A.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14001-14009Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Levels of phospho-Thr286 CAMKII were significantly decreased by the Wnt5A-A2 siRNA, whereas levels of non-phosphorylated CAMKII increased (Fig. 2E). As with the PKC antibodies, it was unclear whether this was due to an inability of the antibody to recognize both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated form, or if this result truly represented an increase in the total pool of PKC and CAMKII. To determine this, we employed a protocol described by Maya et al. (16Maya R. Oren M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3213-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), to dephosphorylate proteins that have already been transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Upon treatment with phosphatase, bands of equal intensity could be detected in all lanes by the antibodies against PKCα,-β, and -γ, contrary to what we had observed in un-phosphatased samples (Fig. 2D, PKCα,β,γ+PPase). For CAMKII, incubation in phosphatase buffer appeared to significantly affect the background on the blot, making it harder to definitively determine, but it also appeared that this antibody could possibly be sensitive, as we observed an increase in CAMKII in the untreated samples, something we had previously not observed (Fig. 2E, CAMKII+PPase). This indicates that these antibodies, at least PKC antibodies, recognize phosphorylation-sensitive epitopes. Regardless, Wnt5A inhibition corresponds to a decrease in PKC activity as demonstrated both by antibodies against the phosphorylated proteins and by confocal microscopy. We have previously demonstrated the ability of Wnt5A to increase PKC activation, and melanoma cell motility, and have also shown that inhibition of Wnt signaling results in a decrease in melanoma cell migration (9Weeraratna A.T. Jiang Y. Hostetter G. Rosenblatt K. Duray P. Bittner M. Trent J.M. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 279-288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Recently we have also demonstrated that manipulating PKC levels in melanoma cells can affect the levels of other proteins, namely claudin-1 and MMP-2 (17Leotlela P.D. Wade M.S. Duray P.H. Rhode M.J. Brown H.F. Rosenthal D.T. Dissanayake S.K. Earley R. Indig F.E. Nickoloff B.J. Taub D.D. Kallioniemi O.P. Meltzer P. Morin P.J. Weeraratna A.T. Oncogene. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn can also affect the migratory capacity of melanoma cells. Here we provide additional pieces of data to demonstrate that PKC itself can act to increase the migratory capacity of melanoma cells. To demonstrate this, we inhibited PKC in Wnt5Ahigh cells, as measured by the decrease in PO4-PKC (Fig. 3A). Unlike the situation with WNT5A knockdown, where there was an inversely correlated increase in non-phosphorylated PKC along with decreases in PO4-PKC, both PO4-PKC and non-phosphorylated PKC were decreased when treating with the inhibitors, implying that the inhibitors were working to affect the expression levels of PKC. We (17Leotlela P.D. Wade M.S. Duray P.H. Rhode M.J. Brown H.F. Rosenthal D.T. Dissanayake S.K. Earley R. Indig F.E. Nickoloff B.J. Taub D.D. Kallioniemi O.P. Meltzer P. Morin P.J. Weeraratna A.T. Oncogene. 2006; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), and others (18Bartolome R.A. Molina-Ortiz I. Samaniego R. Sanchez-Mateos P. Bustelo X.R. Teixido J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), have previously demonstrated that MMP-2 is critical for the migration of melanoma cells and show here that inhibition of PKC in these cells also inhibited the secretion of MMP-2, as determined by gelatin zymography (Fig. 3A, white bands on dark background). Additionally, inhibiting PKC prior to inflicting a scratch wound on Wnt5Ahigh cells resulted in a marked decrease in the ability of these cells to close a scratch wound (Fig. 3B). Next, we looked at the effects of PKC activation in our Wnt5Alow cells. An interesting point should be addressed here: Many studies have indicated that long term activation of PKC can result in a depletion of PKC. It has been our experience that, upon treatment with low concentrations of PMA (200 nm), levels of PO4-PKC fluctuate dramatically for the first 30 min to 1 h, first increasing, then decreasing, and finally stabilizing by 4-12 h, where they can remain elevated for up to 24 h depending on the cell line (Fig. 3C), at which point the PMA requires replenishment in the medium. When looking at total PKC, as well as PO4-PKC in our melanoma cells, we found that this too increased steadily up to 24 h (see Fig. 5C). This implies that, like the inhibitors, PMA acts on the expression levels of PKC as well as its activation, and that contrary to some studies, at least in our cells, long term PKC activation does not result in PKC depletion. To assess this in another manner and to visually determine the effects of phorbol ester on PKC activation, we also transfected our Wnt5Alow cells with the PKC-GFPβII vector and then subjected them to PMA treatment (200 nm) at different time points, fixed the slides, and imaged the results using confocal microscopy (Fig. 3D). PMA caused translocation of GFP-PKCβII to the membrane at early time points such as 30 min, but at time points as late as 24 h, much of the protein still remained at the membrane. In untreated cells, the protein was present both in the cytoplasm and at the membrane. Increases in PKC activation correlated to an increase in MMP-2 secretion (Fig. 3C), which can again be mimicked by treatment with recombinant Wnt5A both by zymography (Fig. 3E) and by imaging of the cell-associated MMP-2, which was increased upon rWnt5A treatment (Fig. 3F). Accordingly, when we treated Wnt5Alow cells with rWnt5A, there was a dramatic increase in the ability of these cells to invade into a scratch wound (Fig. 3G, rWnt5A). When Wnt5Alow cells were treated for 24 h with PMA, there was a similar increase in the ability of these cells to invade into a scratch wound (Fig. 3G, PMA).

https://openalex.org/W2073357074,"Matrix metalloproteinase-9 has recently emerged as an important molecule in control of extracellular proteolysis in the synaptic plasticity. However, no synaptic targets for its enzymatic activity had been identified before. In this report, we show that β-dystroglycan comprises such a neuronal activity-driven target for matrix metalloproteinase-9. This notion is based on the following observations. (i) Recombinant, autoactivating matrix metalloproteinase-9 produces limited proteolytic cleavage of β-dystroglycan. (ii) In neuronal cultures, β-dystroglycan proteolysis occurs in response to stimulation with either glutamate or bicuculline and is blocked by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1, a metalloproteinase inhibitor. (iii) β-Dystroglycan degradation is also observed in the hippocampus <i>in vivo</i> in response to seizures but not in the matrix metalloproteinase-9 knock-out mice. (iv) β-Dystroglycan cleavage correlates in time with increased matrix metalloproteinase-9 activity. (v) Finally, β-dystroglycan and matrix metalloproteinase-9 colocalize in postsynaptic elements in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our data identify the β-dystroglycan as a first matrix metalloproteinase-9 substrate digested in response to enhanced synaptic activity. This demonstration may help to understand the possible role of both proteins in neuronal functions, especially in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory."
https://openalex.org/W2047540449,"Background The great diversity of the “Phytophaga” (weevils, longhorn beetles and leaf beetles) has been attributed to their co-radiation with the angiosperms based on matching age estimates for both groups, but phylogenetic information and molecular clock calibrations remain insufficient for this conclusion. Methodology A phylogenetic analysis of the leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae) was conducted based on three partial ribosomal gene markers (mitochondrial rrnL, nuclear small and large subunit rRNA) including over 3000 bp for 167 taxa representing most major chrysomelid lineages and outgroups. Molecular clock calibrations and confidence intervals were based on paleontological data from the oldest (K-T boundary) leaf beetle fossil, ancient feeding traces ascribed to hispoid Cassidinae, and the vicariant split of Nearctic and Palearctic members of the Timarchini. Principal Findings The origin of the Chrysomelidae was dated to 73–79 Mya (confidence interval 63–86 Mya), and most subfamilies were post-Cretaceous, consistent with the ages of all confirmed body fossils. Two major monocot feeding chrysomelid lineages formed widely separated clades, demonstrating independent colonization of this ancient (early Cretaceous) angiosperm lineage. Conclusions Previous calibrations proposing a much older origin of Chrysomelidae were not supported. Therefore, chrysomelid beetles likely radiated long after the origin of their host lineages and their diversification was driven by repeated radiaton on a pre-existing diverse resource, rather than ancient host associations."
https://openalex.org/W2004404685,"Epithelial cells are exposed to a variety of mechanical forces, but little is known about the impact of these forces on epithelial ion channels. Here we show that mechanical activation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs), which are essential for electrolyte and water balance, occurs via an increased ion channel open probability. ENaC activity of heterologously expressed rat (rENaC) and Xenopus (xENaC) orthologs was measured by whole-cell as well as single-channel recordings. Laminar shear stress (LSS), producing shear forces in physiologically relevant ranges, was used to mechanically stimulate ENaCs and was able to activate ENaC currents in whole-cell recordings. Preceding pharmacological activation of rENaC with Zn2+ and xENaC with gadolinium and glibenclamide largely prevented LSS-activated currents. In contrast, proteolytic cleavage with trypsin potentiated the LSS effect on rENaC whereas the LSS effect on xENaC was reversed (inhibition of xENaC current). Further, we found that exposure of excised outside-out patches to LSS led to an increased ion channel open probability without affecting the number of active channels. We suggest that mechano-sensitivity of ENaC may represent a ubiquitous feature for the physiology of epithelia, providing a putative mechanism for coupling transepithelial Na+ reabsorption to luminal transport."
https://openalex.org/W2043692922,"Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) are generally refractory to extended in vitro culture. In an attempt to recreate some features of the complex set of cues arising from the liver parenchyma, we cocultured adult rat liver SECs, identified by the expression of the marker SE-1, with primary adult rat hepatocytes in a 3D culture system that provides controlled microscale perfusion through the tissue mass. The culture was established in a medium containing serum and VEGF, and these factors were then removed to assess whether cells with the SE-1 phenotype could be supported by the local microenvironment in vitro. Rats expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in all liver cells were used for isolation of the SE-1-positive cells added to cocultures. By the 13th day of culture, EGFP-expressing cells had largely disappeared from 2D control cultures but exhibited moderate proliferation in 3D perfused cultures. SE-1-positive cells were present in 3D cocultures after 13 days, and these cultures also contained Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and CD31-expressing endothelial cells. Global transcriptional profiling did not reveal profound changes between 2D and 3D cultures in expression of most canonical angiogenic factors but suggested changes in several pathways related to endothelial cell function."

In Escherichia coli, DnaA initiates the replication of genomic DNA in a cell cycle-coordinated manner (1Kaguni J.M. Annu. Rev.

The initiation complex contains a homomultimer of DnaA protein and the replication origin, oriC, of the chromosome. DnaA binds cooperatively to the oriC region in a manner depending on tight binding to the DnaA box sequences within the oriC region. The initiation complex containing ATP-bound DnaA molecules unwinds the duplex of the AT-rich 13-mer repeats within oriC, forming an open complex. This leads to the loading of DnaB helicase onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) 4The abbreviations used are: ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation; KH, K homology; NOE, nuclear Overhauser enhancement; NOESY, NOE spectroscopy; PCBP2, poly(C)-binding protein 2; PDB, Protein Data Bank; RIDA, regulatory inactivation of DnaA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; WT, wild type. in the presence of the DnaC helicase loader. In this process, the interaction between DnaA and DnaB is crucial. DnaA creates a specific nucleoprotein structure within which ordered structural DNA changes and protein-protein interactions take place.

In this model of the initiation complex, the ATP-DnaA molecules assemble in a head-to-tail manner, and the resultant oligomers form a spiral helix, consistent with the known features of the AAA+ family proteins (11Hanson P.I. Whiteheart S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 519-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 15Indiani C. O'Donnell M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 751-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The structure-function relationships of the N-terminal domains I and II of DnaA remain obscure. The amino acid sequence of domain I (residues 1–86 in E. coli DnaA; Fig. 1A) is highly conserved among DnaA homologs of eubacterial species, unlike that of domain II (residues 87–134 in E. coli DnaA) (2Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of domain II is suggested to be a flexible linker, part of which is dispensable for DnaA function. Domain I functions in DnaA oligomerization and DnaB helicase loading. A deletion analysis of domain I suggest that a region containing residues 1–77 carries a crucial site for DnaA oligomerization (16Weigel C. Schmidt A. Seitz H. Tungler D. Welzeck M. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The DnaA W6A mutant protein is inactive in initiation, whereas its affinities for oriC and ATP/ADP are sustained (17Felczak M.M.

Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Chemical linking experiments suggest that the activity to form oligomers is somehow reduced in this mutant protein. The mechanism of interdomain I interaction remains unclear. DnaA directs DnaB loading onto the ssDNA region in the presence of DnaC (19Masai H. Nomura N. Arai K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15134-15144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of domain I-truncated mutants suggest that a region containing residues 1–62 is required for direct binding to DnaB during the loading process (20Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34255-34262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), whereas the region containing residues 24–86 is required for physical contact with DnaB (21Seitz H. Weigel C. Messer W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 1270-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The specific residues required for DnaB loading remain to be determined. In addition, DnaB loading activity is prevented by anti-DnaA antibodies that specifically bind to the domain III N terminus (residues 111–148) (22Marszalek J. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

DnaB interaction sites in domain I and domain II may play specific roles in the steps for DnaB loading (20Sutton M.D. Carr K.M. Vicente M. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol.

FEBS J. 2005; 272: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that the interaction of an origin-binding protein with a helicase is a conserved principal mechanism of the initiation process. However, the precise mechanisms of the initiator-helicase interaction and helicase loading remain to be elucidated. To reveal these mechanisms, the structure of the DnaA N-terminal domain and the structure-function relationship within this domain have to be determined. In the present study, we determined the structure of the E. coli DnaA N terminus (residues 1–108) using NMR analysis. We found a unique residue, Glu-21, that is crucial and specific for DnaB loading. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that domain I carries weak affinity for ssDNA carrying the AT-rich 13-mer within oriC but not for poly(dT) ssDNA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel model of DnaA homo-oligomer formation and DnaB helicase loading, in which a hydrophobic surface containing Trp-6 forms homodimers between the DnaA domain I regions within the larger DnaA multimer, thereby exposing Glu-21 for DnaB binding. Protein Preparation of the DnaA N terminus—A 5′-region of the wild-type dnaA corresponding to amino acid residues 1–128 was amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA fragment was ligated into the vector pET-22b(+) (Novagen), and introduced into E. coli BL21(DE3). For the preparation of labeled protein, the transformed cells were cultured in M9 minimal medium containing 15NH4Cl and 13C-labeled glucose. The DnaA N terminus (residues 1–128) was overexpressed from E. coli by induction with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the cells were suspended in chilled buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm spermidine-HCl, and 10% sucrose), incubated on ice for1hinthe presence of 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen cell suspension was melted on ice and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm for 40 min. The resultant supernatants were dialyzed against buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) and loaded onto Toyopearl DEAE-650 M (Tosoh Co.) and Toyopearl CM-650M. The DnaA N terminus was collected in the follow-through fractions after both chromatography. The collected proteins were precipitated by salting-out, using 80% ammonium sulfate. Proteins were subjected to chromatography on Sephadex G-75 with buffer A as the eluent. The typical yield of the DnaA N terminus was 9 mg of protein/liter of M9 medium. Partially proteolysis of flexible region was often improved the NMR spectrum for structural determination of protein (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To partially proteolyze the purified DnaA N terminus, it was treated with l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin (5000:1 w/w) at 4 °C for 12 h. This proteolysis yielded the truncated N terminus (residues 1–108), which was confirmed using MALDI-TOF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy). This truncated DnaA N terminus was further subjected to chromatography on Toyopearl DEAE-650M. Protein in the follow-through solutions was precipitated by salting-out using 80% ammonium sulfate, dissolved in and dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at -20 °C. NMR Measurements and Structural Calculations—The NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Varian Unity INOVA 600 spectrometer. NMR samples (0.8 mm) of the DnaA N terminus were dissolved in buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5), 20 mm EDTA, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose) containing 100% D2O or 90% H2O, 10% D2O. A series of three-dimensional double and triple resonance experiments (HNHA, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCBCA, CACBCONH, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, (H)CC(CO)NH, HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and 15N-edited TOCSY) were recorded for the spectrum assignments of the DnaA N terminus. For the structural determination, the stereospecific assignments of the methyl groups of the leucine and valine residues were obtained from the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum recorded on a 13C biosynthetically directed labeled sample (26Neri D.

Construction, Purification, and Functional Assays of the Site-specifically Mutated DnaA—Mutant DnaA proteins were constructed by a site-directed mutagenesis method as we described previously (12Kawakami H.

The overexpression, purification, and assays of nucleotide binding activities and minichromosomal replication activities using a crude replicative extract and a system reconstituted with purified proteins, P1 nuclease assay, and ABC primosome assay were performed as we described previously (12Kawakami H.

Briefly, DnaA was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in buffer (25 μl) containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Mg(OAc)2, 125 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm ATP, 2.32 μg of single strand-binding protein (SSB), 2.5 ng of HU protein, 150 ng of DnaB, 92 ng of DnaC, 180 ng of DNA gyrase A subunit, 225 ng of DNA gyrase B subunit, and 200 ng of M13KEW101 minichromosome. The reaction was stopped in the presence of SDS and EDTA followed by 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis. A reconstituted, staged regulatory inactivation of DnaA (RIDA) reaction system was used basically as described previously (5Su'etsugu M. Shimuta T.R. Ishida T. Kawakami H. Katayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 36Kawakami H. Su'etsugu M. Katayama T. J. Struct. Biol. 2006; 156: 220-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that we used Hda tagged with His6 at the C terminus. 5M. Su'etsugu and T. Katayama, unpublished. Briefly, the clamps (100 pmol as dimer) were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in 25 μl of buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-58, 8 mm Mg(OAc)2, and 150 mm potassium glutamate) containing 1 mm ATP, 94 ng of γ-complex and M13mp18 replicative form II (1 μg). The resulting DNA-loaded clamps were isolated using a Sephacryl S-400 HR spin column (0.9 ml) equilibrated with buffer C. In the second stage, the indicated amounts of the isolated DNA-loaded clamps were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 8 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-58, 8 mm Mg(OAc)2, 120 mm potassium glutamate, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 56 fmol of the C-terminally His-tagged Hda, and [α-32P]ATP-DnaA (0.25 pmol). Nucleotides bound to DnaA were recovered by filter retention, separated by thin-layer chromatography, and quantified by a BAS2500 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film). The Structure of the DnaA N Terminus—To determine the structure of the DnaA N terminus using NMR analysis, we labeled amino acid residues 1–108 with 15N and recorded the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum at 25 °C and pH 6.5. The spectrum included separated and dispersed peaks. Therefore, we assigned the 1H, 15N, and 13C chemical shifts of the DnaA N terminus using a double-labeled sample and heteronuclear three-dimensional NMR. We were able to assign most signals in the DnaA N terminus except for residues 1–3 (BioMagResBank accession number 10027). We carried out 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE measurements based on the assignment of the chemical shifts. Because the peak intensity ratios (Ion/Ioff) in the domain I region (residues 1–78) are more than 0.8 (Fig. 1C), domain I appears to have a rigid structure in solution. In contrast, the peak intensity ratios (Ion/Ioff) in a region including a short portion of the domain I C terminus and domain II (residues 79–108) were less than 0.6 (Fig. 1C), indicating that this region is flexible and disordered. Additionally, we did not see long-range homonuclear 1H-1H NOEs in the domain II region. Therefore, we divided the DnaA N terminus into two distinct domains, a rigid domain I and a disordered domain II. We calculated the structure of the DnaA N terminus (residues 1–108) on the basis of a total of 814 NOE-derived interproton distances, 61 hydrogen bonds that originated from slowly exchanging amides, and 107 ϕ and Ψ dihedral angle constants that were obtained from calculations using the TALOS program (31Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) (Table 1). A total of 200 structures were calculated, and the 20 lowest energy structures were selected and subjected to restrained energy minimization. The final 20 structures were superimposed on the mean coordinate position for the backbone atoms (N, Ca, C′) of residues 5–78 of DnaA (Fig. 2A). The r.m.s.d. from the mean coordinate position was 0.24 Å for well defined backbone atoms of residues. These calculated parameters are summarized in Table 1. The structure of the DnaA N terminus (residues 1–108) consisted of three β-strands (β1 (residues 31–34), β2 (38–41), and β3 (73–78)), three α-helices (α1 (5–16), α2 (21–25), and α3 (47–62)), and a following long, flexible C terminus (Fig. 1, B and C). The 1H-15N heteronuclear NOE results were consistent with the well defined secondary structure regions obtained from our calculations (Fig. 1C). β1 and β2 form an anti-parallel β-sheet, and β2 and β3 form a parallel β-sheet (Fig. 2B). The α3-helix is kinked at Tyr-55. In a hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange experiment, the amide signals from Lys-54 to Asn-58 were not remained (data not shown); that is, the hydrogen bonds from Lys-54 to Asn-58 were disrupted, supporting the kinked helix. The hydrophobic core of domain I consists of Cys-9, Leu-13, Phe-22, Ile-26, Leu-29, Leu-38, Leu-40, Val-51, Tyr-55, and Ile-59 (Fig. 2C; see supplemental Fig. 1 online). These hydrophobic residues are conserved in DnaA homologs in eubacterial species (supplemental Fig. 2), suggesting that the overall conformation of domain I is evolutionarily conserved. We searched the DALI server (37Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3566) Google Scholar) for proteins that are structurally similar to DnaA domain I (residues 1–78). The K homology (KH) domain had a high Z-score, indicating that its structure is very similar to that of DnaA domain I. The KH domains have two distinct motifs of secondary structure, type I and type II, although the folds are similar to each other (38Grishin N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The Dali server reported the similarity of DnaA domain I to any of type II KH domain, as DnaA domain I has an α-α-β-β-α-β motif. The fold of domain I is similar to that of the type I KH domain as well as that of the type II KH domain (Fig. 2D). Dimerization of Domain I—The KH domain is reported to form homodimers via hydrophobic interaction (39Du Z. Lee J.K. Tjhen R. Li S. Pan H. Stroud R.M. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38823-38830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Therefore, we focused on the hydrophobic interaction between DnaA domain I monomers. The hydrophobic interaction is enhanced at higher salt concentrations. We observed that the chemical shift changes of several peaks of domain I occurred as the KCl concentration was increased to a level near the physiological salt concentration (Fig. 3). The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled DnaA N termini overlap in the presence of 40 mm or 160 mm KCl (Fig. 3A). Residues causing chemical shift changes of more than 0.02 ppm were concentrated in the N-terminal α1-helix and the loop between β1 and β2 (Fig. 3, B and C). Representatives of such residues are Leu-5, Trp-6, Leu-10, and Leu-33, which are exposed on the surface and form a hydrophobic patch (Fig. 3C). DnaA Trp-6 is crucial for weak interactions between DnaA molecules detected in chemical cross-linking experiments (17Felczak M.M. Simmons L.A. Kaguni J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24627-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 18Simmons L.A. Felczak M. Kaguni J.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 849-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, the observed chemical shift changes supported the idea that a pair of domain I monomers forms a homodimer using the hydrophobic patch as an interface (Fig. 3D). Domain I Has a Weak Affinity for the oriC 13-Mer ssDNA but Not for Poly(dT) ssDNA—The KH domain was first characterized biochemically in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K), a major pre-mRNA-binding protein K, and has since been detected in a number of RNA-binding proteins (40Nagai K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Siomi H. Matunis M.J. Michael W.M. Dreyfuss G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1193-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). PCBP2 contains several KH domains that specifically and directly interact with telomere poly(dC) ssDNA (39Du Z. Lee J.K. Tjhen R. Li S. Pan H. Stroud R.M. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38823-38830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Du Z. Yu J. Chen Y. Andino R. James T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 48126-48134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used NMR to investigate whether DnaA domain I interacts with ssDNA. A 28-mer ssDNA bearing the oriC 13-mer sequence caused chemical shift changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the 15N-labeled DnaA N terminus (residues 1–108; Fig. 4A). As the ssDNA concentration increased to a molar ratio greater than 1:6, several signals were shifted. From the chemical shift changes of these peaks, we estimated the Kd to be ∼1 mm (in concentration of the DNA fragment) (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that DnaA domain I has weak affinity for ssDNA carrying the 13-mer sequence. We also plotted the chemical shift changes as a function of the residue number of DnaA at 0.6 mm ssDNA (Fig. 4C). The residues causing chemical shift changes of more than 0.02 ppm are localized in the N-terminal half of the α3-helix and the loop between α1 and α2, a region including Glu-21 (Fig. 4, D and E). Unlike the oriC 13-mer ssDNA, poly(dT) ssDNA did not cause any chemical shift changes (Fig. 4B and supplemental Fig. 3), suggesting that the affinity of domain I for ssDNA is associated with at least some sequence specificity. Construction and Solubility of Novel DnaA Domain I Mutants—Based on the solution structure and sequence homology of domain I, we selected sites within domain I to mutate for a functional analysis. First, we individually replaced Arg-12, Gln-14, Asp-15, Glu-16, Glu-21, Asn-44, Arg-45, Phe-46, and Lys-54 with alanine using pKA234, an arabinose-inducible DnaA-overproducing plasmid (12Kawakami H.

In this work, we have identified six putative Arabidopsis squalene epoxidase (SQE) enzymes and used heterologous expression in yeast to demonstrate that three of these enzymes, SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3, can epoxidize squalene. We isolated and characterized Arabidopsis sqe1 mutants and discovered severe developmental defects, including reduced root and hypocotyl elongation. Adult sqe1–3 and sqe1–4 plants have diminished stature and produce inviable seeds. The sqe1–3 mutant accumulates squalene, consistent with a block in the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway. Therefore, SQE1 function is necessary for normal plant development, and the five SQE-like genes remaining in this mutant are not fully redundant with SQE1.

Plants are estimated to produce more than 500,000 secondary metabolites (1Hadacek F. CRC Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 2002; 21: 273-322Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). These compounds have many functions, including attracting pollinators, communicating with neighboring plants, and defending against pathogens and herbivores (2Swain T. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1977; 28: 479-501Crossref Google Scholar, 3Pichersky E. Gershenzon J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2002; 5: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The importance of secondary metabolites is highlighted by the extensive resources that plants invest in producing these compounds. Although once thought to be metabolically simple, more than 170 secondary metabolites have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (reviewed in Ref. 4D'Auria J.C. Gershenzon J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2005; 8: 308-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Triterpenoids are the 30-carbon subset of terpenoids, the largest class of secondary metabolites. Triterpenoid biosynthesis is diagramed in Fig. 1. Isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate are synthesized from mevalonate and oligomerized to farnesyl diphosphate by farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS). 5The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; BR, brassinosteroid; cDNA, complementary DNA; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; PN, plant nutrient; RT, reverse transcription; SQE, squalene epoxidase; T-DNA, transfer-DNA; TUB, tubulin. 5The abbreviations used are: FPS, farnesyl diphosphate synthase; BR, brassinosteroid; cDNA, complementary DNA; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; PN, plant nutrient; RT, reverse transcription; SQE, squalene epoxidase; T-DNA, transfer-DNA; TUB, tubulin. Farnesyl diphosphate is dimerized to squalene by squalene synthase. Squalene epoxidase (SQE)-mediated oxidation then produces oxidosqualene, which triterpene synthases cyclize to >80 triterpene skeletons (5Xu R. Fazio G.C. Matsuda S.P.T. Phytochemistry. 2004; 65: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 6Phillips D.R. Rasbery J.M. Bartel B. Matsuda S.P.T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2006; 9: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Further metabolism of these compounds produces membrane sterols, brassinosteroid phytohormones, saponins, other defense compounds, cuticular waxes, and numerous triterpenoids that have not been functionally characterized. The yeasts and mammals that have been investigated each encode a single squalene epoxidase. In contrast, several plants have multiple genes predicted to encode squalene epoxidases, a diversity suggesting that this step may be subject to additional or unique regulation in plants. Two Medicago truncatula SQE enzymes have been biochemically characterized (7Suzuki H. Achnine L. Xu R. Matsuda S.P.T. Dixon R.A. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The Brassica napus (8Schafer U.A. Reed D.W. Hunter D.G. Yao K. Weninger A.M. Tsang E.W. Reaney M.J. MacKenzie S.L. Covello P.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), Populus trichocarpa, and Oryza sativa genomes each have multiple predicted SQE enzymes. Despite the likely importance of SQE to plant growth and development, no plant mutants with defects in these enzymes have been reported. In this work, we heterologously expressed the six Arabidopsis putative SQE enzymes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking squalene epoxidase to determine which have squalene epoxidase activity. We isolated Arabidopsis sqe1 loss-of-function mutants and found that these mutants display severe developmental defects and accumulate squalene. Our results demonstrate that SQE1 is particularly important for oxidosqualene production in the roots and reproductive tissues of Arabidopsis. Chemicals—Bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, pyridine, and potassium hydroxide were from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI). Lovastatin (mevinolin), squalene, epibrassinolide, hemin, ergosterol, raffinose, TRI Reagent, and cholesterol ethyl ether were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Methanol, methyl t-butyl ether, dichloromethane, and hexane (OmniSolv grade) were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ). Ammonium glufosinate (Basta) was from Sigma-Aldrich and Crescent Chemical (Augsburg, Germany). Sitosterol was obtained from wild-type (Col-0, Columbia) Arabidopsis plant extracts by high pressure liquid chromatography purification and was identified by NMR and GC-MS. Oxidosqualene was synthesized according to previously published procedures (9Nadeau R.G. Hanzlik R.P. Methods Enzymol. 1968; 15: 346-351Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yeast Expression—SQE1 (At1g58440), SQE3 (At4g37760), SQE5 (At5g24150), and SQE6 (At5g24160) were PCR-amplified from an Arabidopsis cDNA library in the pSPORT vector (10LeClere S. Bartel B. Plant Mol.

The Arabidopsis cDNAs and the yeast ERG1 coding sequence were subcloned into the galactose-inducible yeast expression vector pRS426Gal (12Hart E.A. Hua L. Darr L.B. Wilson W.K. Pang J. Matsuda S.P.T.

RXY6.2 transformants were tested for ergosterol prototrophy by assaying growth on synthetic medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, 13 μg/ml hemin, and 5 μl/ml Tween 80. RXY6 transformants were tested for oxidosqualene accumulation by growing 10-ml cultures in synthetic medium lacking uracil and supplemented with 2% galactose, 2% raffinose, 13 μg/ml hemin, 5 μl/ml Tween 80, and 20 μg/ml ergosterol. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.2 m sodium phosphate (pH 6.2), and lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Squalene and oxidosqualene in the resultant extracts were separated by thin layer chromatography in hexane:ethyl ether (20:1) and visualized with p-anisaldehyde.

Cell pellets (490–900 mg) were washed twice with water and saponified in 5 ml of 10% KOH, 80% ethanol, and 4.5 mm butylated hydroxytoluene at 70 °C for 2 h. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were extracted three times with 15 ml of hexane. The combined hexane extracts were dried under a N2 stream and dissolved in 1 ml of methylene chloride prior to GC-MS analysis, which was conducted as described below using the 260 °C isothermal oven temperature program. Plant Mutant Identification—sqe1–1 (Salk_138454), sqe1–2 (Salk_016111), and sqe1–3 (Salk_022763) were isolated from the Salk Institute T-DNA insertion collection (17Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N.

The sqe1–3 mutant allele was identified by amplification with LB1-Salk and At1g58440-8 (5′-AACACCCTTGCGAATGCTCTTT-3′), which yielded a 408-bp product, and the SQE1 allele was identified by amplification with At1g58440-7 (5′-GCTGGGAAAAACATCTGCCTAACT-3′) and At1g58440-8, which yielded a ∼450-bp product. sqe1–4 mutants were identified using an insert-specific primer (CSHL_Ds3-2, 5′-CGATTACCGTATTTATCCCGTTC-3′) and SQE44–4R2 (5′-GTTGACAACAGAAAACGATTAATCTA), which yielded a ∼500-bp product, and the SQE1 allele was identified by amplification with SQE44–4F (5′-GATGTATCCAATTAGTAGCACAGAGGT-3′) and SQE44-4R2, which yielded a 526-bp product. Plant Growth Conditions—Seeds were surface-sterilized in a 30% bleach solution with 0.01% Triton X-100 for 12 min, rinsed extensively with sterile water, and grown aseptically on plant nutrient (PN) medium (19Haughn G.W. Somerville C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 430-434Crossref Scopus (477) Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.5% sucrose (hereafter referred to as PNS) and solidified with 0.1% agar under continuous white light at 22 °C unless otherwise indicated. Seedlings were transferred to soil (Metro-Mix 200, Scotts, Marysville, OH) and grown under continuous white light at 22 °C. For hydroponic growth, seedlings were transferred from agar-based medium to 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing ½× liquid PN medium. Aerial portions were suspended above the liquid by threading roots through a hole in a piece of Parafilm over the top of the flask. For hypocotyl elongation assays, seeds from an SQE1/sqe1–3 heterozygote were incubated in the light for 1 day before transfer to the dark at 22 °C for five additional days. Hypocotyl lengths were measured and seedlings were transferred to PN medium for an additional 2 weeks in the light. PCR analysis of seedling DNA was used to determine the genotype (SQE1/SQE1, SQE1/sqe1–3, or sqe1–3/sqe1–3) of each plant. For root elongation assays, seeds from an SQE1/sqe1–3 heterozygote were grown vertically on PNS medium at 22 °C for 11 days. Root lengths were measured daily, and PCR analysis of seedling DNA was used to determine the genotype of each plant. RNA Analysis—Seven- and 14-day-old seedlings and 54-day-old rosette leaves, stems, inflorescences, and siliques from wild type and 14-day-old sqe1–3 seedlings were collected for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) used a 0.6-μg total RNA template and random hexamer primers. PCR amplification of the resultant cDNA was performed using the following oligonucleotides: sqe1–3 (spanning the location of the T-DNA), At1g58440-7 and At1g58440-8; SQE1 (upstream of the T-DNA), SQE1cDNA-1 (5′-CTCTCCTCATCTCCTTCGTCGCTTTCTAT-3′) and SQE1cDNA-2 (5′-ATGCGGTTTGTTCCTCTCCTGCTTTATTCTT-3′); SQE2, SQE2probe-1 (5′-CGCCGGTTCCGCTCTTGCTCATACT-3′) and SQE2probe-2 (5′-ACCCGTGTTTTCAGATACTTTGCCATTTCA-3′); SQE3, SQE3-3 (5′-TGATTATTCCGTTTTCTTCCACCAA-3′), and SQE3probe-3 (5′-GTTATAGAAAGAGACTTAACG-3′); SQE4, SQE4probe-1 (5′-AATAGCGCAGGCGAAGAAATAACG-3′) and SQE4 probe-2 (5′-ATTGGCTTGCGGATGATGTAAAA-3′); SQE5, SQE5probe-1 (5′-ATAGCGCAGGCGAAGAAACAACAG-3′) and SQE5probe-2 (5′-GCCGCCTAGCAAAGCCATCATC-3′); SQE6, SQE6probe-1 (5′-TAAAGAAGGCGAAGAAACAACAGC-3′) and SQE6probe-2 (5′-AGAAGACGGCGTAGAATGAGAATG-3′); and TUB4, TUB4-P1 (5′-TCAATCTGGTGCCGGAAATAAC-3′) and TUB4-P2 (5′-AGCTTGAGGGTACGGAAACAG-3′). sqe1–3 Mutant Rescue—Arabidopsis SQE1, SQE4, and SQE5 cDNAs were excised from the pRS426Gal-SQE vectors described above using SalI and NotI and subcloned into the 35SpBARN (10LeClere S. Bartel B. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 46: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) vector cut with XhoI and NotI. Plasmids were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens GV3101 (20Koncz C. Schell J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1986; 204: 383-396Crossref Scopus (1545) Google Scholar), which was used to transform SQE1/sqe1–3 plants using the floral dip method (21Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on PN medium supplemented with 7.5 μg/ml ammonium glufosinate. Homozygous sqe1–3/sqe1–3 mutants were identified in the T1 or T2 generation using PCR as described above, and lines homozygous for the 35S transgene were selected by examining the pattern of ammonium glufosinate resistance in the T3 generation. Microscopy—Seedlings, roots, and developing seeds were visualized using a Leica MZ FLIII dissecting microscope. Plant Lipid Extraction—Roots and aerial tissues from 15-day-old sqe1–3 and wild type (Col-0) grown on PNS medium were harvested for chemical analysis. For these experiments, sqe1–3/sqe1–3 plants were selected from the progeny of a SQE1/sqe1–3 parent by visually inspecting the root phenotype at 15 days. For trial 1, ∼50 sqe1–3/sqe1–3 seedlings were selected from ∼500 segregating plants, and for trials 2 and 3, ∼100 sqe1–3/sqe1–3 seedlings were selected from ∼1000 segregating plants. Tissue from ∼50 (trial 1) or 86 (trials 2 and 3) wild-type Col-0 plants was used for comparison. Fresh plant tissue (trial 1, 454.5 mg aerial and 54.2 mg root for sqe1–3, 452 mg aerial and 58.2 mg root for Col-0; trial 2, 644.8 mg aerial and 118.3 mg root for sqe1–3, 623.2 mg aerial and 90.8 mg root for Col-0; trial 3, 600.6 mg aerial and 125.8 mg root for sqe1–3, 632.0 mg aerial and 106.5 mg root for Col-0) was extracted with 1:1 CH2Cl2/MeOH (3 × 8 ml for aerial tissues; 3 × 3mlfor roots). Extracts were dried under a N2 stream, washed with water, and weighed. Recovered non-polar extracts in trial 1 were 4.2 mg of aerial and 1 mg of root for sqe1–3; 2.6 mg of aerial and 0.6 mg of root for Col-0. In trial 2, recovered nonpolar extracts were 5.8 mg of aerial and 0.3 mg of root for sqe1–3; 2.8 mg of aerial and 0.4 mg of root for Col-0. In trial 3, recovered non-polar extracts were 17.1 mg of aerial and 2 mg of root for sqe1–3; 11 mg of aerial and 1.4 mg of root for Col-0. An aliquot of the redissolved extracts (4% of aerial; 20–25% of root) was removed for GC-MS analysis (with 1.2 μg of cholesterol ethyl ether standard added to each). Sitosterol was quantified in this crude sample for use as an internal standard to correct for losses during subsequent purification required for squalene quantification. Saponification—To the remainder of the extracts dissolved in MeOH (96% of aerial; 75–80% of roots), KOH solution was added to make 12.5% KOH in 75:25 MeOH/water (1.2 ml for roots; 6 ml for aerial). These solutions were saponified at 70 °C under N2 for 2 h. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature and extracted with methyl t-butyl ether (5 × 3 ml for aerial; 5 × 1 ml for roots) and washed with water until the washing water was neutral. Aliquots of the non-saponifiable lipid extracts were analyzed using GC-MS (6–9% of aerial; 38–43% of root; with 1.2 μg of cholesterol ethyl ether standard added to each). Solid Phase Extraction—A further purification was performed on lipids from the aerial tissues, because squalene was less abundant, and more extract was available. The remaining non-saponifiable lipids of the aerial extracts were dissolved in 8 ml of 6% CH2Cl2/hexane and loaded onto 500 mg of silica solid phase extraction cartridges (J & W Scientific, Folson, CA) preconditioned with hexane. Lipids were eluted with sequential 8-ml portions of 10% CH2Cl2/hexane, 2, 10, and 25% methyl t-butyl ether in hexane, and neat methyl t-butyl ether, respectively, and all fractions were subjected to GC-MS analysis (fractions 1 and 2 contained squalene, and fractions 4 and 5 contained sitosterol). GC-MS Analysis—Trimethylsilyl ether derivatives were prepared by treatment of dried samples with 60 μl of 1:1 pyridine: bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide at room temperature followed by direct injection for GC-MS analysis. GC retention times for trimethylsilyl-derivatized samples and standards were determined on an Agilent 5973N massselective detector interfaced to an Agilent 6890N GC system equipped with a Rtx-35 capillary column (Restek, 30 m × 0.25 mm inner diameter, 0.10 μm film thickness). Samples (2 μl) were injected at 280 °C in split mode (split ratio 40:1). Helium flow was maintained at 1 ml/min. Mass spectra were collected with electron-impact ionization at 70 eV and a 230 °C ion source over a mass range of 50–650 Da. Two GC oven temperature programs were used. In the first program, the oven temperature was initially held at 150 °C for 1 min, increased at 15 °C/min to 250 °C, followed by an increase at 1 °C/min to 270 °C, and then held at 270 °C for 20 min (m/z 410 at 11.7 min for squalene, m/z 414 at 17.0 min for cholesterol ethyl ether, and m/z 486 at 20.7 min for trimethylsilyl-sitosterol). The second program used an isothermal oven temperature of 260 °C (m/z 410 at 4.6 min for squalene, m/z 414 at 9.0 min for cholesterol ethyl ether, and m/z 486 at 12.6 min for trimethylsilyl-sitosterol). Analytes were identified by comparing GC retention time and mass spectra with those of authentic standards. Amounts of squalene and sitosterol were determined by comparing peak area ratios to the added standard, cholesterol ethyl ether, based on six-point calibration curves (R2 > 0.99). Arabidopsis Squalene Epoxidase Genes—Six putative squalene epoxidase genes were identified in the Arabidopsis genome using a BLAST search (22Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) with the characterized Medicago SQE enzymes (7Suzuki H. Achnine L. Xu R. Matsuda S.P.T. Dixon R.A. Plant J. 2002; 32: 1033-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). We identified additional plant epoxidases using a BLAST search with the Arabidopsis SQE1 sequence and used these sequences to generate a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). Three putative Arabidopsis epoxidase enzymes (SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3) are 71–75% identical to characterized Medicago SQE enzymes. In contrast, the other three putative Arabidopsis epoxidases (SQE4, SQE5, and SQE6) are only 44–48% identical to characterized Medicago epoxidases but are more closely related to two Brassica putative SQE enzymes (8Schafer U.A. Reed D.W. Hunter D.G. Yao K. Weninger A.M. Tsang E.W. Reaney M.J. MacKenzie S.L. Covello P.S. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 39: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3 are 44–46% identical to the characterized SQE enzymes from yeast and humans, whereas SQE4, SQE5, and SQE6 are only 27–38% identical to these enzymes (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3Protein sequence alignment of characterized SQE enzymes. The Arabidopsis SQE sequences were aligned with other characterized SQE sequences using MegAlign (DNAStar) and the ClustalW method. Identical residues in at least six sequences are boxed in black. Similar residues are boxed in gray. Triangles indicate the locations of T-DNA inserts in sqe1–3 and sqe1–4. The black rectangle indicates a predicted flavin adenine dinucleotide binding domain (53Sakakibara J. Watanabe R. Kanai Y. Ono T. J. Biol.

Open circles indicate residues that alter the catalytic efficiency of R. norvegicus ERG1 for squalene versus oxidosqualene substrates (41Abe I. Abe T. Weiwei L. Masuoka T. Noguchi H. Biochem.

Commun. 2007; 352: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether any of the Arabidopsis SQE homologs have squalene epoxidase activity, we expressed each Arabidopsis cDNA in a S. cerevisiae erg1 mutant, which lacks the ERG1 squalene epoxidase and is therefore a sterol auxotroph (23Karst F. Lacroute F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and assayed the growth of the transformed yeast on medium lacking exogenous sterols. We found that the Arabidopsis SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3 cDNAs complemented the yeast erg1 null mutant to a similar extent as the yeast ERG1 gene (Fig. 4, A and B), suggesting that these cDNAs encode functional squalene epoxidases. In contrast, Arabidopsis SQE4, SQE5, and SQE6 failed to complement the erg1 mutant (Fig. 4, A and B), consistent with the possibility that these putative SQE enzymes are catalytically distinct, as suggested by the phylogenetic analysis. As we do not have antibodies to the SQE proteins, we could not explore the alternate possibility that SQE4, SQE5, and SQE6 do not accumulate when expressed in yeast. To examine the products of the SQE enzymes, we expressed the Arabidopsis epoxidases in an erg1 erg7 double mutant, which lacks both the ERG1 squalene epoxidase and the ERG7 lanosterol synthase (24Corey E.J. Matsuda S.P.T. Bartel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2211-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), the enzyme that would normally metabolize any oxidosqualene made following heterologous SQE expression. Thin layer chromatography analysis of extracts from these strains revealed that oxidosqualene failed to accumulate to detectable levels in erg1 erg7 yeast expressing SQE4, SQE5, or SQE6 but accumulated to similar levels in erg1 erg7 yeast expressing ERG1, SQE1, SQE2, or SQE3 (data not shown). GC-MS analysis confirmed that erg1 erg7 yeast expressing SQE1, SQE2, or SQE3 all produce oxidosqualene (Fig. 4, C–J, and supplemental Fig. 1), as expected from the ability of these genes to rescue the yeast erg1 mutant (Fig. 4B). Together, the yeast complementation and GC-MS data demonstrate that SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3 encode bona fide squalene epoxidases but do not illuminate the activity of SQE4, SQE5, and SQE6. In addition to 2,3-oxidosqualene, we found that Arabidopsis SQE1 and SQE3 produced easily detectable amounts of 2,3:22,23-dioxidosqualene (Fig. 4, G and J, and supplemental Fig. 1) when expressed in yeast. Similarly, the yeast ERG1 enzyme oxidized 2,3-oxidosqualene to 2,3:22,23-dioxidosqualene (Fig. 4, E and G). In contrast, SQE2 expression in erg1 erg7 yeast yielded oxidosqualene, but dioxidosqualene was not detected (Fig. 4I). These data suggest that the Arabidopsis SQE enzymes may have distinct substrate preferences. To examine the expression of the Arabidopsis SQE genes, we compiled data from the Genevestigator expression data base (25Zimmermann P. Hirsch-Hoffmann M. Hennig L. Gruissem W. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2621-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). This analysis revealed substantial SQE1 and SQE3 transcript levels in most plant tissues, whereas SQE2 and SQE4 appear to be more weakly expressed (Fig. 5A). SQE5 appears to be expressed most highly in adult plant tissues, and SQE6 is most highly expressed in seeds, hypocotyls, and rosettes (Fig. 5A). We confirmed these general patterns using RT-PCR analysis of SQE transcripts in several tissues from wild-type plants (Fig. 5B). Developmental Defects of sqe1–3—We sought to explore the in vivo roles of the SQE genes with confirmed squalene epoxidase activity (SQE1, SQE2, and SQE3) by examining the phenotypes of loss-of-function mutants from various T-DNA insertion collections. For SQE1, we isolated three T-DNA insertion mutants from the Salk Institute collection (17Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P.

https://openalex.org/W2095367518,"The bradykinin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to the Gαq family of heterotrimeric G proteins. In general, a GPCR can exert intracellular signals either by transiently associating with multiple diffusing G protein subunits or by activating a G protein that is stably bound to the receptor, thus generating a signal that is limited by the stoichiometry of the complex. Here we have distinguished between these models by monitoring the association of type 2 bradykinin receptor (B2R) and the Gαq/Gβγ heterotrimer in living human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing fluorescent-tagged proteins. Stable B2R-Gαq·Gβγ complexes are observed in resting cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from either Gαq-eCFP or eCFP-Gβγ to B2R-eYFP. Stimulating the cells with bradykinin causes detachment of B2R from the G protein subunits as the receptor internalizes into early endosomes, with a corresponding elimination of B2R-G protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer because Gαq and its associated Gβγ remain on the plasma membrane. Single point and scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements show that a portion of B2R molecules diffuses with a mobility corresponding to dimers or small oligomers, whereas a second fraction diffuses in higher order molecular assemblies. Our studies support a model in which receptors are pre-coupled with their corresponding G proteins in the basal state of cells thereby limiting the response to an external signal to a defined stoichiometry that allows for a rapid and directed cellular response.

Our studies support a model in which receptors are pre-coupled with their corresponding G proteins in the basal state of cells thereby limiting the response to an external signal to a defined stoichiometry that allows for a rapid and directed cellular response. Cell signaling through heterotrimeric G proteins involves the binding of an extracellular agonist to its corresponding 7-transmembrane receptor (GPCR). 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BK, bradykinin; BR, bradykinin receptor; ACF, autocorrelation functions; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PLC, phospholipase C; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; CPM, 7-(diethylamino)-3,4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; B2R, type 2 bradykinin receptor; RITC, rhodamine isothiocyanate; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor. 2The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; BK, bradykinin; BR, bradykinin receptor; ACF, autocorrelation functions; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; eCFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein; eYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; FCS, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PLC, phospholipase C; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; CPM, 7-(diethylamino)-3,4′maleimidylphenyl)-4-methylcoumarin; B2R, type 2 bradykinin receptor; RITC, rhodamine isothiocyanate; β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor. The agonist-bound receptor is then able to catalyze the exchange of GTP for GDP on the Gα subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein (i.e. Gαβγ). The Gα(GTP) has a weaker affinity for Gβγ allowing Gα(GTP) and Gβγ to interact with diverse effector proteins (for background see Ref. 1Alberts B. Bray D. Lewis J. Raff M. Roberts K. Watson J. Molecular Biology of the Cell.3rd Ed. Garland, New York1994: 734-758Google Scholar). This mechanism allows G protein signaling to be transduced by two ways. In the first, a diffusion model, the agonist-bound receptor activates a large number of G proteins through rapid association and diffusion. This model also indicates that the dynamics of the activated receptor that determines its encounter with G proteins impacts the efficiency of signal propagation (2Peters R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 234: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the second, a stoichiometric model, the receptor, its associated G protein subunits, and effectors exist in a pre-formed complex. This model limits the number of G proteins that a single receptor can activate to the number of proteins in the complex, and it restricts the temporal and spatial aspects of the associated signal. Importantly, a pre-formed signaling complex would direct a signal to a particular pathway as opposed to the scenario where G proteins were freely diffusing and could contact multiple receptors and effectors. The organization of GPCRs in their natural cellular environment is unknown. There is increasing evidence that GPCRs form homo- and heterodimers and oligomers, and this complex formation modifies their response to agonists and their interaction with downstream signaling molecules (for review see Ref. 3Angers S. Salahpour A. Bouvier M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). However, the relative population of GPCRs in the monomeric, dimeric, and higher oligomeric states is unknown, and it is also not known whether GPCR dimers are complexed with their corresponding G proteins in larger molecular assemblies in living cells. In this study, we have distinguished between the two signaling models described above using the bradykinin-B2R-Gαq/Gβγ-PLCβ signaling system. Bradykinin (BK) is a key mediator of the inflammation response and binds strongly to its two corresponding G protein-coupled receptors, B1R and B2R. B1R is only expressed in certain inflammatory and pathologic states, unlike B2R, which is constitutively expressed (4Kang S.K. Kim D.K. Damron D.S. Baek K.J. Im M.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 293: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stimulation of B2R by BK causes activation of the Gαq family of heterotrimeric G proteins (5de Weerd W. Leeb-Lundberg L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17858-17866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Activated Gαq stimulates the activity of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ). Inositol-specific PLCs catalyze the hydrolysis of a minor component in lipid membranes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, to produce two second messengers that lead to an increase in intracellular calcium and activation of protein kinase C (for review see Ref. 6Rebecchi M. Pentylana S. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Thus, addition of BK to cells expressing B2R results in a corresponding increase in intracellular Ca2+ leading to a host of mitogenic and proliferative changes. Upon the binding of agonist BK, B2R is desensitized by phosphorylation on serine and threonine residues on its C terminus (7Blankat A. Barac A. Cross M.J. Offermanns S. Dikic I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6837-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 8Blaukat A. Pizard A. Breit A. Wernstedt C. Alhenc-Gelas F. Muller-Esterl W. Dikic I. J. Biol.

Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Lamb M.E. De Weerd W.F. Leeb-Lundberg L.M. Biochem.

If Gαq and Gβγ subunits are bound to receptor in the basal state, then their fate during and after receptor desensitization is uncertain. It has been found that Gαs and Gβγ subunits coupled to β2-adrenergic receptors dissociate from the membrane as the agonist-bound receptors internalize (13Hynes T.R. Mervine S.M. Yost E.A. Sabo J.L. Berlot C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 44101-44112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Whether B2R internalization affects the localization of Gαq and Gβγ is unknown. In this study, we have assessed the organization of Gαq/Gβγ and B2R by FRET using eCFP/eYFP-tagged proteins (14Smrcka A.V. The Use of Green Fluorescent Proteins to View Associations between Phospholipase Cβ and G Protein Subunits in Cells. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2003: 223-232Google Scholar). We measured the mobility of the GFP-tagged receptor using FCS (15Maiti S. Haupts U. Webb W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. 2004; 87: 1260-1267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and we related the mobility to the size of the receptor-G protein complexes. We also find that B2R receptors are pre-coupled with G proteins in the basal state supporting a stoichiometric model of signaling. We find that a significant population of B2R·G protein complexes exists in higher order structures on the membrane surface thus allowing simultaneous stimulation of a number of G protein subunits. Materials—G protein constructs eCFP-Gβ1, GFP-Gβ1, HAγ7, and Gαq-eCFP were provided by Dr. Catherine Berlot (Geisinger Clinic, Danville, PA). Human B2R and B2R-GFP constructs were provided by Dr. Frederick Leeb-Lundberg (University of Texas, San Antonio, TX). Fluorescent tags are inserted between residues 124 and 125 (opposite the membrane-binding site) of murine Gαq and on the N terminus of human Gβ1. The constructs used in this study, when expressed in cells, were found to activate PLC. eYFP-PLCδ1, used as a negative control in the FRET studies, was provided by Dr. Mario Rebecchi (Stony Brook University), and eCFP-(GS)5-eYFP, used as a positive FRET control, was provided by Dr. Jeffrey Pessin (Stony Brook University). EEA1 antibody (early endosomal marker) was a gift from Dr. Deborah Brown (Stony Brook University). Leibovitz's L-15 media was purchased from Invitrogen, and bradykinin was obtained from Fisher. Restriction enzymes PacI and MluI were purchased from New England Biolabs. Gαq,Gβ1,B2R, and PLCβ2 rabbit polyclonal primary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. We note that the Gαq antibody detects all members of the Gαq family. All fluorescent probes were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. Construction of B2R-eYFP Plasmid—B2R-GFP plasmid was modified to obtain B2R-eYFP. B2R is flanked by enzyme sites XbaI at the N terminus and MluI at the C terminus. GFP is on the C terminus of B2R and is flanked by PacI enzyme site at its C terminus. GFP from B2R-GFP was digested out with MluI and PacI enzymes and separated by gel electrophoresis. PCR was performed on eYFP with primers CCGGTCACGCGTATGGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAG and GGCTGATTTTAATTAATTATCTAGATCCGGTGGATCCCGG to insert the MluI and PacI restriction enzyme sites into the N and C termini of eYFP, respectively. After digestion of the PCR product, eYFP was separated from its vector and then ligated to the B2R fragment with vector to obtain B2R-eYFP plasmid. Cell Culture and Transfection of HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were transfected by calcium phosphate coprecipitation in which 5-10 μg of plasmid was mixed with 120 mm CaCl2 and HBS buffer (21 mm Hepes, 123 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 0.9 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.1), incubated on ice for 10 min, and added to cells maintained in 60-mm dishes. The medium of the cells was replaced after overnight incubation. Determination of Levels of Endogenous Gβγ and Gαq and Overexpressed GFP-B2R in HEK293 Cells—Western blot band densities corresponding to known amounts of purified Gβγ or Gαq (standard) and those corresponding to Gβγ or Gαq on the natural membranes were measured and used to estimate the amount of Gβγ and Gαq on the natural membranes. We note that samples were measured in the linear range of the standard curves made using purified proteins. An average of 90 ng of Gβγ and 30 ng of Gαq was obtained per 10 μg of total membrane proteins loaded in the lanes. Therefore, the amounts of Gβγ and Gαq relative to the total membrane protein present on the natural membranes were 0.9 and 0.3%, respectively. Based on these calculations, the amounts of endogenous Gβγ and Gαq on the natural membranes, which were titrated into the cuvette in the binding experiments, were determined. The total amount of membrane proteins present after titration was 0.6 μg, with a total endogenous Gβγ of 5.4 ng and endogenous Gαq of 1.8 ng, which corresponds to 3 nm endogenous Gβγ and 1 nm endogenous Gαq. The amount of endogenous Gβγ and Gαq in a single cell was estimated by dividing the amount of proteins by the total number of cells from which the membranes were prepared. To estimate the amount of overexpressed GFP-B2R, we compared the fluorescence intensities from HEK293 cell membranes to known concentrations of PH(PLCδ1)-GFP. The overexpressed level of B2R-GFP is ∼37 pm. Western Blotting—Proteins in HEK293 cell fractions were separated through gel electrophoresis and transferred from an SDS gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the membrane with 1% BSA, the membrane was incubated with primary antibody. Primary antibody for Gαq or Gβ1 was used to immunoblot these proteins. This was followed by three washes and incubation with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The bands were then detected by adding color-developing reagents. Immunofluorescence to Label Early Endosomes—HEK293 cells overexpressing B2R-GFP were washed twice with PBS followed by stimulation with 1 μm BK. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, incubated for 10 min, and washed three times with Modified Shields Media/PIPES buffer (18 mm MgSO4, 5 mm CaCl2, 40 mm KCl, 24 mm NaCl, 5 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for 7 min each. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 5% goat serum, 1% BSA, and 50 mm glycine for 15 min. EEA1 monoclonal mouse antibody diluted to 1:100 in PBS + 1% BSA was added followed by incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. The antibody was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS + 1% BSA for 10 min each. This was followed by the addition of anti-mouse Texas Red secondary antibody, which was diluted to 1:200 in PBS + 1% BSA, and subsequent incubation at 37 °C for 45 min. After washing the cells three times each for 10 min with PBS, they were viewed in PBS under a fluorescent microscope. Measurement of Cellular Calcium—Cellular calcium levels were determined with the fluorescent calcium indicator dye Fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) in an ISS spectrofluorometer. HEK293 cell monolayers were washed two times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (118 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glucose, 15 mm Hepes, 1% BSA, pH 7.4) and were detached by a buffer stream. Suspended cells were counted, labeled with 1 μm Fura-2-AM for 45 min at 37 °C in HBSS with rotation, and washed twice to remove extracellular dye. Cell density was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml in HBSS, and the suspension was placed in a cuvette, and the ratio of fluorescence intensities at excitation wavelengths at 340 and 380 nm was taken by monitoring the emission at 510 nm. The intensity ratios were monitored over a period of 10 min during which the cells were stimulated and lysed with 10% Triton followed by addition of 400 nm EDTA. Each event was separated by a time interval of 2 min. The ratio was converted into calcium concentration with the relation (20Ricupero D.A. Polgar P. Taylor L. Sowell M.O. Gao Y. Bradwin G. Mortensen R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar): [Ca2+]i free (nm) = ((R - Rmin)/(Rmax - R)) × (Fmax/Fmin) × Kd (nm), where Kd ∼225 nm; Fmax is the fluorescence in EDTA buffer, and Fmin is the fluorescence in the presence of detergent-excess calcium. R is the measured ratio, and Rmin and Rmax are the ratios corresponding to the EDTA and detergent-excess calcium conditions, respectively. Membrane Binding Studies—Membranes from wild type HEK293 cells or ones overexpressing B2R were prepared by washing harvested cells twice with PBS and centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 5 min. A mixture of phosphate-buffered saline, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, and protease inhibitor mixture for mammalian cells was added, and the cells were homogenized and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min in 4 °C. The supernatant was then spun at 50,000 × g for 35 min at 4 °C to collect the pellet that contains the total membrane fraction. Concentration of total membrane protein was measured using protein assay. Note that these fractions are the total cellular membranes, including plasma membranes, and studies using these preparations only focused on comparing the presence of overexpressed B2R. The binding of Gαq or Gβγ subunits to natural membranes was carried out by labeling with the thiol-reactive probe CPM as described previously (21Philip F. Scarlata S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11691-11700Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Binding was measured on the proteins immediately after dialysis that removed storage detergent. Natural membrane fractions from HEK293 cells were added to CPM-labeled Gβγ or Gαq subunits, and changes in CPM emission spectra were monitored exciting at 384 nm and scanning the emission spectrum from 420 to 540 nm. After correcting for background scatter and dilution, the normalized changes in emission energies were plotted and fit to obtain an apparent partition coefficient, Kp. FRET between RITC-Gβγ and B2R-GFP was carried out by labeling Gβγ subunits with N-terminal reactive probe RITC (X rhodamine) by adding a 2-fold excess of RITC after dialyzing Gβγ in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate and β-mercaptoethanol buffer, pH 9.0. After incubation on ice for 30 min, RITC-Gβγ was dialyzed in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol to remove the excess probe. RITC-labeled Gβγ was titrated into cuvette containing natural membranes from HEK293 cells expressing B2R-GFP. Titration of Gβγ-RITC into a cuvette containing control buffer was recorded for background subtraction. B2R-GFP was excited at 470 nm, and emission spectra were scanned from 500 to 660 nm to obtain both donor and acceptor peaks for each trial. Decrease in donor and the corresponding increase in acceptor emissions were recorded and analyzed to obtain an apparent dissociation constant for Gβγ and B2R. Fluorescence Imaging and FRET in Cells—Images of cells overexpressing fluorescent-tagged B2R, Gβγ, and/or Gαq were taken on Zeiss Axiovert 200M. HEK293 cells were viewed under the microscope in L-15 medium (without phenol red) with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% glucose. Cells were monitored for 48 h after stimulation to ensure that stimulation did not lead to the formation of any irregular characteristics. Imaging in two channels was done for immunofluorescence and colocalization experiments, and three-channel imaging was done for FRET measurements. The mean intensity of a region of interest was calculated using a plug-in for the ImageJ software. Three-dimensional plots were constructed by taking the average fluorescence intensities along concentric circles at increasing distances from the center of a cell to the membrane and plotting the intensities against these distances as a function of time. Average intensities were calculated for each frame acquired over time and normalized to the highest value in each frame to correct for photobleaching (see below). The percentage colocalization of B2R-eYFP and eCFP-Gαq or eCFP-Gβγ was analyzed using ImageJ software. Briefly, the images in grayscale from both eYFP and eCFP channels were corrected for background and converted to black and white. This was done by converting the pixel values in each image to either 0 (all pixels below a threshold value) or 255 (all pixels above the threshold value). The black and white images from both channels were then added to obtain a colocalized image. Two points were considered colocalized if their respective intensities were strictly higher than the threshold of their channels. The mean intensity of the resulting colocalized image was divided by the average of the intensities from the black and white images of the two channels to obtain a percentage of colocalization of the two proteins. Percentage of colocalization calculated with a plug-in available with the software provided us with similar values. Energy transfer between eCFP-Gβγ-B2R-eYFP and eCFP-Gαq-B2R-eYFP pairs was measured by taking images of cells coexpressing both proteins under three filters, CFP, YFP, and FRET (CFP, 31044v2, exciter D436/20x, dichroic 460DCLP, emitter D480/40m; YFP, 41029, exciter HQ500/20x, dichroic Q515LP, emitter HQ520LP; and FRET, 31052, exciter D436/20x, dichroic 460DCLP, emitter D535/30m). The FRET filter excites at the eCFP excitation wavelength and transmits light at the eYFP emission wavelength. FRET data were analyzed by taking the intensities of images acquired through the FRET (IFRET), CFP (ICFP), and YFP (IYFP) filters and first correcting for background. The resulting image intensity from each channel was then corrected for photobleaching that had occurred through the channel. This was done by dividing the image intensity by e-kt, where k is the rate of decay. Rate of decay for each filter was obtained by fitting intensity values from photo-bleached cells expressing either eCFP or eYFP to an exponential rise to maximum function in Sigmaplot. After correcting for photobleaching, a normalized FRET value was calculated with the following equation (see Ref. 22Xia Z. Liu Y. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 2395-2402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar): NFRET = IFRET - (ICFP × α) - (IYFP × β)/((ICFP × IYFP)1/2), where α and β are CFP and YFP bleed through emissions through the FRET filter, respectively. Averaging over 12 cells on our system, the bleed through values for CFP and YFP channels are 39 and 28%, respectively, using the background-corrected intensities calculated using ImageJ software from the National Institutes of Health. A plug-in is created in ImageJ to correct for background and to calculate normalized FRET after bleed through corrections were used to obtain images showing pixel intensities that correspond to normalized FRET values. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy Measurements—FCS measurements were carried out using both 1-photon and 2-photon excitation. 1-Photon FCS experiments (only single point) were performed with an Axiovert 200 microscope with a ConfoCor2 unit equipped with a 40× (N.A. 1.2) water immersion objective (Apochromat) and a continuous argon ion laser (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Excitation of the fluorophore (GFP) was at 488 nm with an incident laser power of 20 micro-watts, and the fluorescence was recorded using an avalanche photodiode through a long pass emission filter (LP505). The time trace of the fluorescence was analyzed by a digital temporal correlator to compute the autocorrelation function G(τ). The ConfoCor2 software controlled the experimental setup and produced the autocorrelation function. The focal volume for the FCS experiment was determined by calibrating the instrument with a 2 nm Alexa488 solution in which the diffusion constant is DAlexa488 = 2.2 × 10-6 cm2/s. All measurements were done at room temperature, ∼25 °C. Autocorrelation functions, G(τ)s, were analyzed using the fitting routine for two-dimensional diffusion provided by Zeiss with their ConfoCor2 software. We used the following equation: G(τ) = ∑ai (1 + τ/τD)-1, where τD is the residence time of a molecule in FCS observation volume, and ai is the relative contribution of the ith species in the autocorrelation. Diffusion coefficient, D, is calculated from τD of a molecule using Einstein relation for diffusion: r2 = 4D × τD, where r is the radius of the observation volume (for details see Refs. 15Maiti S.

Single point FCS and scanning FCS measurements using 2-photon excitation were performed at the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) headed by Dr. Enrico Gratton (University of California, Irvine). FCS measurements were performed at ∼25 °C as described (19Ruan Q. Cheng M.A. Levi M. Gratton E. Mantulin W.W. Biophys.

A mode-locked titanium-sapphire laser with 80-MHz, 100-fs pulse width (Tsunami; Spectra-Physics, Mountain View, CA) was used as the excitation light source. The laser was guided into the microscope by x-y galvano-scanner mirrors (model 6350; Cambridge Technology, Watertown, MA) to achieve beam scanning in both x and y directions. A voltage generated by a computer card moved the scanner mirrors. The movement of the x scanner mirror was independent from the y scanner mirror movement. For scanning FCS experiments with a circular laser beam orbit, the x and y scanner mirrors were driven by two identical sine waves with 90° phase shift. The radius and frequency of the circular scan were controlled by the amplitude and frequency of the sine waves. A photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu R7400P, Japan) was used for light detection in the photon counting mode. A BG39 optical filter (Chroma Technologies, Brattleboro, VT) was placed before the photomultiplier. A Zeiss 40× (1.2 N.A.) water-immersion objective lens was used for the measurement. All data acquisition and analysis were done using SIMFCS and GLOBALS software developed in Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign) by Prof. Gratton. For single point FCS, the sampling rate was 64 kHz, and the total measurement lasted less than 5 min. For scanning FCS the orbital scanning frequency was 1 kHz with a sampling rate (pixel rate) of 64 kHz and total measurement times of 512 s. The laser power at the sample was 10 milliwatts. The average fluorescence intensity of the sample remained constant, indicating that the extent of photobleaching was negligible, if any. The waist ω0 of the excitation beam was calibrated each day by measuring an autocorrelation curve of a 10 nm fluorescein solution in 0.01 m NaOH. The beam waist was derived from a fit to this curve by assuming a fluorescein diffusion coefficient of 3 × 10-6 cm2/s; typically ω0 values of 0.3 μm-0.5 μm were obtained. For single point FCS data, the experimental autocorrelation function was fitted using a three-dimensional Gaussian-Lorentzian beam profile (26Berland K.M. So P.T. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 694-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 27Chen Y. Muller J.D. So P.T.C. Gratton E. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 553-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) and one- or two-dimensional diffusion equations (see above). The concentration (C) of the fluorescent species was calculated from the G(0) value obtained from the autocorrelation fits according to the following equation: C = γ/Gi(0)NAVPSF, where NA is Avogadro's number, and VPSF is the volume of the point spread function (∼1 femtoliter). The factor γ accounts for the illumination of the excitation volume and equals 0.072"

In order to address the question of whether this down-regulation is a necessary prerequisite for the myelination process, transgenic mice expressing the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV under the control of the proteolipid protein promoter were generated.

Fukuda M. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). NCAM occurs in various isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing (2.Eckhardt M. Mühlenhoff M. Bethe A. Koopman J. Frosch M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Nature. 1995; 373: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The three major isoforms of NCAM are the two transmembrane proteins NCAM-180 and NCAM-140 and the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked NCAM-120. The latter is the predominant isoform in oligodendrocytes (3.Goridis C. Brunet J.F. Semin. Cell Biol. 1992; 3: 189-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PSA is synthesized in the Golgi apparatus by two sialyltransferases, ST8SiaIV (4.Bhat S. Silberberg D.H. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 1830-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 5.Nakayama J.

Although in the mammalian brain, polysialylated NCAM (PSA-NCAM) is mainly found in neurons, other cell types within the central nervous system synthesize PSA-NCAM as well. Migrating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPC) express PSA, which is, however, down-regulated after these cells reach their final destination and start to differentiate into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes (8.Trotter J. Bitter-Suermann D. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 22: 369-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9.Bartsch U. Kirchhoff F. Schachner M. J.

Neurosci. 1995; 7: 480-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The presence of PSA seems to be functionally important, since migration of OPC is impaired after endoneuraminidase treatment, which specifically hydrolyzes PSA (11.Wang C. Pralong W.F. Schulz M.F. Rougon G. Aubry J.M. Pagliusi S. Robert A. Kiss J.Z. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1565-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). More recent data suggest that PSA is not required for cellular motility in general but for directional movement of OPC in response to platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (12.Zhang H. Vutskits L. Calaora V. Durbec P. Kiss J.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In addition to its effect on migration, PSA seems also to inhibit differentiation of OPC into mature myelinating oligodendrocytes, because removal of PSA by endoneuraminidases accelerates oligodendrocyte differentiation (13.Decker L. Durbec P. Rougon G. Evercooren A.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2002; 19: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). PSA is also down-regulated in neurons at the time when their axons become myelinated. Axons that remain nonmyelinated in the adult (e.g. mossy fibers in the hippocampus) in contrast remain PSA-positive (14.Seki T. Arai Y. Neurosci. Res. 1991; 12: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 15.Le Gal La Salle G. Rougon G. Valin A. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 872-882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations together with the fact that premature removal of PSA accelerates myelin formation led to the hypothesis that PSA expressed on the axonal membrane is an inhibitor of myelination (16.Charles P. Hernandez M.P. Stankoff B. Aigrot M.S. Colin C. Rougon G. Zalc B. Lubetzki C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7585-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that premature removal of PSA by endoneuraminidase increases myelin formation in vivo and in vitro (16.Charles P. Hernandez M.P. Stankoff B. Aigrot M.S. Colin C. Rougon G. Zalc B. Lubetzki C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7585-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The re-expression of PSA in multiple sclerosis lesions (17.Charles P. Reynolds R. Seilhean D. Rougon G. Aigrot M.S. Niezgoda A. Zalc B. Lubetzki C. Brain. 2002; 125: 1972-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and hypomyelinated mice (18.Takikita S. Fukuda T. Mohri I. Yagi T. Suzuki K. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2004; 63: 660-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) might therefore be one factor inhibiting (re)myelination. Accelerated oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation by premature removal of PSA suggests but does not prove that the normal postnatal down-regulation of PSA is a prerequisite for myelination. In order to further address this question and to discriminate between PSA-dependent effects in oligodendrocytes and neurons, we have generated transgenic mice overexpressing the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV in neurons and oligodendrocytes. In the present study, we asked whether down-regulation of PSA in OPC is a secondary effect of the differentiation process or whether PSA down-regulation is a prerequisite for myelin formation. Using transgenic mice overexpressing the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV in oligodendrocytes via the proteolipid protein (PLP) promoter, we show here that the continuous expression of PSA in mature oligodendrocytes causes hypomyelination. Generation of PLP-PST Transgenic Mice−Mouse ST8SiaIV was amplified by PCR using oligonucleotides PSTsense (5′-GCAAGCTTCCATGCGCTCAATTAGAAAACG-3′) and PSTanti (5′-GCTCTAGATTATTGCTTCATGCACTTTCC-3′), digested with HindIII and XbaI (introduced restriction sites are underlined in the primer sequences), treated with Klenow enzyme (fill-in reaction), and ligated into the PmeI site of the PLP promoter cassette (19.Fuss B. Afshari F.S. Colello R.J. Macklin W.B. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 18: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by W. B. Macklin (Cleveland Clinic Foundation)) (see Fig. 1A). Correct sequence of ST8SiaIV cDNA was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In order to generate transgenic mice, vector sequences were removed from the plasmid by digesting the DNA with NotI and ApaI, followed by agarose gel purification. The promoter-cDNA-poly(A) fragment was isolated and purified using Qiaquick gel purification (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and Elutip purification (Schleicher & Schuell). Pronucleus injection into fertilized eggs from F2 C57BL/6×CBA mice was performed at the Karolinska Center for Transgene Technologies (Stockholm, Sweden). Founder mice were identified by Southern blotting using a 32P-labeled ST8SiaIV cDNA probe as described (20.Fewou S.N. Büssow H. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Vanier M.T. Macklin W.B. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Several founder mice were obtained, from which two independent transgenic lines (tg246 and tg281) were established and maintained on a mixed C57BL/6×CBA genetic background. Genotyping of mice was done by PCR on genomic tail DNA using oligonucleotides PSTsense and PSTanti as primers, which resulted in a 1090-bp product in the presence of the transgene. Oligodendrocyte Primary Culture and Immunofluorescence−Mixed cultures were prepared from the forebrains of newborn mice (postnatal day 1 or 2) (21.McCarthy K.D. de Vellis J. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3378) Google Scholar, 22.Morganti M.C. Taylor J. Pesheva P. Schachner M. Exp. Neurol. 1990; 109: 98-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded and maintained in tissue culture flasks, coated with poly-l-lysine (molecular weight >300,000) (Sigma) in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) for 8-10 days. Cell suspensions were prepared as described and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% horse serum. After 8-10 days, when cells reached confluence, oligodendrocyte precursor cells grown on top of the astrocyte monolayer were shaken off and seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips at a density of 3-4 × 104/12-mm coverslip and grown in SATO medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.1 mm putrescine, 0.2 μm progesterone, 0.5 μm triiodothyronine, 0.22 μm sodium selenite, 0.1 mg/ml apotransferrin, 520 nml-thyroxine, 25 μg/ml gentamycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) with 1% horse serum. After 1-4 days, coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (PBS) (10 min). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 30 min in 0.2% gelatin in PBS, and cells were permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. Cells were incubated with rabbit antiserum against myelin basic protein (MBP), diluted in 0.2% gelatin in PBS. In some experiments, cells were additionally stained with antibodies directed against PSA (mouse monoclonal antibody 735) (23.Frosch M. Gorgen I. Boulnois G.J. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1194-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), l-myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) (kindly provided by A. M. Butt, University of Portsmouth, UK), and NCAM (rat monoclonal antibody H28; Chemicon). Additional PSA immunostainings were performed with anti-embryonic NCAM rat IgM antibody (BD Biosciences). Primary antibodies were detected with anti-rat IgM-Alexa Fluor 594, anti-rat Ig-Alexa Fluor 488, anti-rabbit Ig-Cy2, anti-rabbit Ig-Cy3, and anti-mouse Ig-Cy3 (Jackson Immunoresearch/Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) in blocking solution. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Specimens were mounted in Kaiser’s gelatin and analyzed with an Axiovert 100M microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). In some experiments, deconvolution was applied to z-stacks using the Axiovision program (Carl Zeiss). Northern Blot Analysis−Brain RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated in 1% agarose formaldehyde gels and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). cDNA probes were generated with [α-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Megaprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Biosciences) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Hybridization was done as described (24.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Membranes were first exposed to Bio-Imager screens followed by exposure to x-ray films. In Situ Hybridization−cRNA probes for PLP and PDGF α receptor were synthesized as described recently (20.Fewou S.N. Büssow H. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Vanier M.T. Macklin W.B. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 25.Yaghootfam A. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Mouse ST8SiaIV was subcloned into the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen), and cRNA probes for MAG were transcribed from a MAG cDNA in pCR-Blunt II TOPO vector (clone IRAM p995E019Q obtained from RZPD, Berlin, Germany). MBP cDNA was amplified from murine brain RNA by reverse transcription-PCR using oligonucleotides MBPsense (5′-GCCTGGATGTGATGGCATCAC-3′) and MBPanti (5′-AGGTGCTTCTGTCCAGCCATAC-3′). The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRV site of pBluescript SK(-). Antisense and sense probes were transcribed with T7 or SP6 RNA polymerase and digoxigenin-RNA labeling mix following the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). In situ hybridization on brain sagittal paraffin sections or cryosections was done as described (20.Fewou S.N. Büssow H. Schaeren-Wiemers N. Vanier M.T. Macklin W.B. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 94: 469-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Bound probes were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) and nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrates. Sections were examined with a Zeiss Axiovert inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Immunofluorescence of Brain Cryosections−Brains were removed, immediately frozen in cold isopentane, and stored at -80 °C. Coronal or sagittal cryosections were cut at 10 μmona cryostat (Leica CM3050S cryotome) at -20 °C and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Cryosections were stored with desiccant at -80 °C. Sections were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin, 5% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. PSA and MBP were stained with antibodies 735 and rabbit MBP antiserum (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany) in blocking solution. Primary antibodies were visualized with anti-mouse Ig Cy2-conjugate and anti-rabbit Ig Cy3-conjugate in blocking solution. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Sections were mounted in Kaiser’s gelatin (Merck) and examined with a Zeiss Axiovert fluorescence inverted microscope attached to an Axiocam camera. Photographs were taken with the Axiovision program (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Detection of Apoptotic Cells−Apoptotic cells were detected using bromodeoxyuridine incorporation with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase using a 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate-FragELT DNA fragmentation detection kit (Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Brain cryosections were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, treated with 3% H2O2 for 5 min, and incubated with dNTP, 5-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase in reaction buffer for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, bromodeoxyuridine was detected using anti-bromodeoxyuridine-biotin/streptavidin peroxidase conjugate and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate. Lipid Analysis−Lipids were isolated from brain or purified myelin and analyzed as described (25.Yaghootfam A. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 21: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Phosphoglycerolipids were removed by mild alkaline hydrolysis. Lipids were dissolved in methanol/chloroform (1:1) and applied onto HPTLC silica gel 60 plates (Merck). Sphingomyelin (Sigma) and gangliosides from bovine brain (Calbiochem/Merck) were applied as standards. Gangliosides were separated by TLC using chloroform, methanol, 0.22% CaCl2 (60:35:8). In some experiments, myelin lipid TLCs were developed in chloroform/methanol/water (70: 30:4). Lipids were visualized by spraying TLC plates with cupric sulfate in aqueous phosphoric acid followed by a 10-min incubation at 180 °C. Myelin Purification−Myelin was isolated from the fore-brains of wild-type and transgenic mice at various time points as described by Norton and Poduslo (26.Norton W.T. Poduslo S.E. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were homogenized in 10.5% (w/v) sucrose using an Ultra-turrax homogenizer (Janke & Kunkel, Staufen, Germany). Homogenates were centrifuged for 45 min with 17,000 × g. The myelin-containing upper part of the pellet was resuspended in 30% sucrose, overlaid with 10.5% sucrose, and centrifuged for 50 min with 68,000 × g. Myelin was recovered from the 30%/10.5% interphase, washed twice with water, and subjected to a second sucrose gradient in order to remove contaminating axolemma. Purified myelin was again washed twice with water, resuspended in water, and stored in aliquots at -80 °C. In order to determine the total amount of myelin in the brain, the purified myelin was lyophilized, and the dry weight was determined. For protein assays and Western blotting, myelin samples were solubilized in 1% SDS. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. In some experiments, phosphatase inhibitors were included in all solutions: 1 mm sodium ortho-vanadate, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting−Forebrains were homogenized in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl (Tris-buffered saline), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation of the homogenate at 500 × g for 10 min followed by centrifugation of the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. SDS-PAGE (7, 10, or 12% acrylamide) was done using standard procedures (27.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Protein transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (pore size 0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schuell) was done with 39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris as the transfer buffer using the semidry blotting technique as described (27.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-PSA mouse IgG 735, anti-NCAM rat IgG H28 (kind gifts from Dr. R. Gerardy-Schahn, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany), rabbit anti-Fyn Ig (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-MBP Ig (Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany), and mouse anti-β-actin IgG (Sigma). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% dry milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and primary antibodies were diluted in the same buffer. Bound primary antibodies were detected using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch/Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) followed by chemiluminescence detection with x-ray films, as described (28.Eckhardt M. Fewou S.N. Ackermann I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 317-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, lysates were incubated with 20 μg/ml endoneuraminidase NF (gift from Dr. R. Gerardy-Schahn) for 2 h at room temperature before adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Sialic acids were detected with biotinylated lectin (10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20) from Tritrichomonas mobilensis (Calbiochem/Merck) followed by streptavidin-conjugated peroxidase (Jackson Immunore-search/Dianova) and chemiluminescence detection. Signal intensities of linear exposures were quantified by densitometry using AIDA software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Data were tested for significant differences using Student’s t test. Histology and Electron Microscopy−Intracardial perfusion with glutaraldehyde, tissue processing, and electron microscopy was done as described (29.Büssow H. J. Neurocytol. 1978; 7: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Generation of PLP-PST Transgenic Mice−Transgenic mice expressing the polysialyltransferase ST8SiaIV under the control of the PLP promoter were generated (Fig. 1A). Several transgenic founder mice were identified by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1B), and two transgenic lines, tg246 and tg281, were established and maintained on a mixed C57BL/6×CBA genetic background. Expression of the transgene was examined by Northern blotting using a ST8SiaIV-specific cDNA probe (Fig. 1C). These experiments showed a significant up-regulation in the transgene expression between postnatal day 1 (P1) and adult mice (7 weeks). In contrast, the endogenous ST8SiaIV-expression was down-regulated. In situ hybridizations of 4-week-old mouse brains with a digoxigenin-labeled ST8SiaIV cRNA probe indicated expression of the transgene in oligodendrocytes in the white matter tracts of forebrain, thalamus, and cerebellum (Fig. 1D), as expected. Detection of the endogenous ST8SiaIV expression required much longer incubation times and is therefore not visible here (data not shown). Size and morphology of the brain appeared not to be altered in the transgenic mice, and we did not observe changes in the postnatal development of the olfactory bulb, which is reduced in size in NCAM-deficient mice (30.Cremer H. Lange R. Christoph A. Plomann M. Vopper G. Roes J. Brown R. Baldwin S. Kraemer P. Scheff S. Barthels D. Rajewsky K. Wille W.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1163-1174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of brain homogenates revealed that PSA was increased in the adult brains of transgenic mice (Fig. 1E), although PSA-expression was also considerable in wild-type mice in accordance with previous observations (32.Finne J. Bitter-Suermann D. Goridis C. Finne U. J. Immunol. 1987; 138: 4402-4407PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reprobing the membranes with NCAM-specific antibodies showed that the NCAM-120 bands were strongly reduced in the transgenic brains because of the molecular mass shift due to the presence of PSA. Western blot analysis of forebrain total membranes pretreated with endoneuraminidase (endoN) to remove PSA indicated that the level of all NCAM isoforms was not changed in the transgenic mice (Fig. 1E) and confirmed that most NCAM-120 (which is the major NCAM isoform in oligodendrocytes) in the brain of transgenic mice was polysialylated. The presence of PSA in oligodendrocytes was further examined by immunofluorescence on coronal and sagittal cryosections of adult (3-month-old) brains using PSA- and MBP-specific antibodies. PSA in the forebrain of wild-type mice was restricted to the subventricular zone around the lateral ventricle (Fig. 2A, wt), where PSA-positive neural precursors are generated in the adult brain (34.Doetsch F. Alvarez-Buylla A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14895-14900Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), but was absent from white matter tracts (e.g. the corpus callosum). In contrast, PSA was strongly expressed in the corpus callosum (Fig. 2A, tg) and other white matter tracts in the striatum (Fig. 2B, tg) and cerebellum (Fig. 2C, tg) of transgenic mice. Thereby, PSA partially co-localized with MBP (Fig. 2D), indicating the presence of PSA-NCAM in myelin. No co-localization of PSA and MBP in wild-type brains was observed. Data shown are from the line tg246; however, similar results were obtained with transgenic mice of the line tg281. Presence of PSA in Purified Myelin of PLP-PST Transgenic Mice−In order to address the question of whether the presence of PSA interferes with myelination, MBP protein levels were determined in the forebrain of adult (3-month-old) wild-type and transgenic mice (Fig. 3A). Densitometric evaluation clearly showed that compared with wild-type mice, MBP levels were significantly reduced in both transgenic lines. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from brains of transgenic and wild-type mice at different ages indicated that the down-regulation of MBP protein was (at least in part) due to reduced MBP mRNA expression (Fig. 3C). MBP mRNA levels were decreased in young transgenic mice up to 12 weeks of age but reached normal levels in older animals. In contrast, expression of the oligodendrocyte marker cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST), which starts to be expressed earlier during oligodendrocyte differentiation, was similar in wild-type and transgenic mice at all time points analyzed (Fig. 3, C and E). In order to confirm reduced myelin content in transgenic mice, myelin was purified from the forebrains of transgenic and wild-type mice at different time points (between 1 week and 12 weeks of age), and its dry weight was determined (Fig. 4A). We found a significant reduction in the myelin content at P21 and 10-12 weeks. The difference of the mean at P10 was not significant, most likely because of the low myelin content at this age. To examine possible changes in the myelin composition, Western blot analysis was performed. These confirmed the presence of polysialylated NCAM-120 in myelin (Fig. 4B). The total amount of NCAM-120 in myelin was, however, not reduced in the myelin of transgenic mice (Fig. 4C). Examination of several other myelin proteins, Fyn, CNP, MBP, did not reveal obvious differences in the amount of these proteins in purified myelin (Fig. 4D). Furthermore, silver staining of SDS-poly-acrylamide gels did not indicate obvious changes in the myelin protein composition between transgenic and wild-type mice (data not shown). In order to rule out the possibility that overexpression of ST8SiaIV affects other sialylation reactions because of the increased utilization of CMP-sialic acid for polysialylation, brain homogenates, membranes, and purified myelin were examined by Western blotting using the sialic acid binding lectin from Tritrichomonas. No significant differences in the lectin staining pattern were observed (Fig. 5, A and B). Furthermore, we examined gangliosides isolated from the forebrain and purified myelin of adult (8-month-old) transgenic and wild-type mice. Alkaline-stable lipids were separated by HPTLC. In the forebrain samples, we found a significant reduction in the ganglioside GM1 in the transgenic mice. In addition, the levels of two other myelin-specific sphingolipids, galactosylceramide and sulfatide, were decreased (Fig. 5C). In purified myelin, however, the level of galactosylceramide, sulfatide, and ganglioside GM1 was not decreased in transgenic mice as compared with wild-type controls (Fig. 5D). We therefore conclude that the overexpression of ST8SiaIV did not inhi"
https://openalex.org/W2052056310,"The Escherichia coli isocitrate lyase regulator (IclR) regulates the expression of the glyoxylate bypass operon (aceBAK). Founding member of a large family of common fold transcriptional regulators, IclR comprises a DNA binding domain that interacts with the operator sequence and a C-terminal domain (C-IclR) that binds a hitherto unknown small molecule. We screened a chemical library of more than 150 metabolic scaffolds using a high-throughput protein stability assay to identify molecules that bind IclR and then tested the active compounds in in vitro assays of operator binding. Glyoxylate and pyruvate, identified by this method, bound the C-IclR domain with KD values of 0.9 ± 0.2 and 156.2 ± 7.9 μm, as defined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Both compounds altered IclR interactions with operator DNA in electrophoretic mobility shift assays but showed an antagonistic effect. Glyoxylate disrupted the formation of the IclR/operator complex in vitro by favoring the inactive dimeric state of the protein, whereas pyruvate increased the binding of IclR to the aceBAK promoter by stabilizing the active tetrameric form of the protein. Structures of the C-IclR domain alone and in complex with each effector were determined at 2.3 Å, confirming the binding of both molecules in the effector recognition site previously characterized for the other representative of the family, the E. coli AllR regulator. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated the importance of hydrophobic patch formed by Met-146, Leu-154, Leu-220, and Leu-143 in interactions with effector molecules. In general, our strategy of combining chemical screens with functional assays and structural studies has uncovered two small molecules with antagonistic effects that regulate the IclR-dependent transcription of the aceBAK operon.

In general, our strategy of combining chemical screens with functional assays and structural studies has uncovered two small molecules with antagonistic effects that regulate the IclR-dependent transcription of the aceBAK operon. A classical bacterial repressor, termed IclR, participates in the regulation of the aceBAK operon in Escherichia coli (1.Kornberg H.L. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1967; 49: 1479-1490PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aceBAK operon encodes for the enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass (3.Chung T. Klumpp D.J. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 386-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are required during growth on acetate since it bypasses the two CO2-evolving steps of the Krebs cycle (4.Kornberg H.L. Madsen N.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 24: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The expression of these enzymes is induced during growth on minimal medium supplemented with acetate or fatty acids (3.Chung T. Klumpp D.J. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 386-392Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as in rich medium as a result of the acetate accumulation during exponential phase. According to early genetic studies (1.Kornberg H.L. Bull. Soc. Chim. Biol. 1967; 49: 1479-1490PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Maloy S.R. Nunn W.D. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 149: 173-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) IclR represses the expression of aceBAK operon as well as its own gene by binding to specific operator sequences in the promoter region. Two separate operator sequences, termed IclR-boxes, have been identified in the promoter region upstream of the aceB gene (5.Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The primary operator sequence (IclR box II) has been mapped between -52 and -19 bases of the aceB promoter, and binding of IclR to this site prevents the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction (5.Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Binding to the second site, IclR box I, which is located between -125 and -99 bases of the aceB promoter, disassembles the open complex through a protein-protein interaction between IclR and the RNA polymerase α-subunit (5.Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A third IclR-box was located between +14 and -21 bases of the iclR promoter (6.Gui L. Sunnarborg A. Pan B. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 321-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All three IclR-boxes identified in the promoters of aceB and iclR genes contain near-perfect palindromes. Although not identical, their sequences share a 15-mer consensus motif, 5′-TGGAAATNATTTCCA, which was identified by in vitro random oligonucleotide selection experiments (7.Pan B. Unnikrishnan I. LaPorte D.C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3982-3984Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In growth media containing acetate, IclR is believed to release the DNA as a result of binding a small molecule. Although this molecule is likely related to a metabolite within the glyoxylate bypass pathway, the precise nature of this IclR effector remains nevertheless in doubt. Phosphoenolpyruvate was reported to alter IclR binding to DNA in vitro (8.Cortay J.C. Negre D. Galinier A. Duclos B. Perriere G. Cozzone A.J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) but recently was shown to have no effect on IclR activity by Yamamoto and Ishihama (5.Yamamoto K. Ishihama A. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 47: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IclR is the founding member of a large family (Pfam 01614, COG1414) of sequence-related microbial transcriptional regulators with more than 500 members identified in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Numerous bacterial genomes such as E. coli K12 (9.Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W.

The characterized members of this family are involved in the regulation of diverse catabolic pathways ranging from the degradation of plant cell polysaccharides in the plant pathogen Erwinia chrysanthemi (12.Reverchon S. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to the metabolism of aromatic acids in E. coli, Acinetobacter (13.DiMarco A.A. Averhoff B.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 5062-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The characteristic structural features for members of this family, gained primarily from the crystal structure of TM0065 from Thermotoga maritime (PDB code 1MKM), are fully consistent with the role of transcription regulators responding to chemical stimuli (16.Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19183-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The TM0065 structure confirmed the presence of N-terminal classic-winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain as well as demonstrated that the effector binding C-terminal domain has significant structural homology to the PAS/GAF domain, a known small molecule binding motif (17.Pellequer J.L. Wager-Smith K.A. Kay S.A. Getzoff E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5884-5890Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 18.Repik A. Rebbapragada A. Johnson M.S. Haznedar J.O. Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 806-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The N- and C-terminal domains in the structure are connected by a linker helix, which together with N-terminal domain participates in protein dimerization. In the crystal lattice TM0065 dimers further oligomerize into tetramers, which appear to be the functional unit common for a number of IclR regulators (16.Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S.

The C-terminal domain retains its structure and small molecule binding function when expressed without the DNA binding domain and was structurally characterized for three E. coli representatives of IclR family, KdgR (PDB code 1YSP), YiaJ (PDB code 1YSQ), and AllR 3The abbreviations used are: AllR, allantoin utilization regulatory protein; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assays; TBE, Tris-buffered EDTA. (Ref. 20.Walker J.R. Altamentova S. Ezersky A. Lorca G. Skarina T. Kudritska M. Ball L.J. Bochkarev A. Savchenko A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 810-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, PDB code 1TF1). Although sharing relatively low sequence identity between them and with previously characterized TM0065, all four structures were very similar, confirming a common structural framework for most of the IclR family members. AllR is involved in transcriptional regulation of the allantoin catabolism (19.Cusa E. Obradors N. Baldoma L. Badia J. Aguilar J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 7479-7484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and shares 42% sequence identity with IclR. The AllR C-terminal domain structure was recently determined in the presence and absence of its chemical effector glyoxylate (20.Walker J.R. Altamentova S. Ezersky A. Lorca G. Skarina T. Kudritska M. Ball L.J. Bochkarev A. Savchenko A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 810-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), providing the first detailed view of the molecular interactions of an IclR family representative with a small molecule. According to the AllR-glyoxylate complex structure, the location of the effector binding pocket in IclR regulators corresponded to the co-factor-accommodating cavity in PAS/GAF domains; however, the binding mechanisms were not conserved between these structurally similar domains (17.Pellequer J.L.

Savchenko A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 810-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Of the hundreds of IclR family members, only a few of the sensor chemicals have been identified, which apart from glyoxylate, include 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid for E. coli MhpR (21.Torres B. Porras G. Garcia J.L. Diaz E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27575-27585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), 2-keto-2-deoxyglyconate for E. chrysanthemi KdgR (12.Reverchon S. Nasser W. Robert-Baudouy J. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 2203-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), p-hydroxybenzoate and protocatechuate for Acinetobacter PobR and PcaU, respectively (13.DiMarco A.A. Averhoff B. Ornston L.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4499-4506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Popp R. Kohl T. Patz P. Trautwein G Gerischer U. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1988-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), N-3-oxo-octanoyl homoserine lactone (3OC8HSL) for Agrobacterium tumefaciens AttJ (23.Zhang H.B. Wang L.H. Zhang L.H. Proc.

Thus, the effector specificity of hundreds IclR regulators, including the founding member of the family, remains uncertain. To address these issues we used IclR as a test case and screened it against a large number of intermediates associated with glyoxylate bypass including phosphoenolpyruvate as part of a library of more than 150 metabolites by a high-throughput protein stability assay (25.Senisterra G.A. Markin E. Yamazaki K. Hui R. Vedadi M. Awrey D.E. J. Biomol. Screen. 2006; 11: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 26.Vedadi M. Niesen F.H. Allali-Hassani A. Fedorov O.Y. Finerty Jr., P.J. Wasney G.A. Yeung R. Arrowsmith C. Ball L.J. Berglund H. Hui R. Marsden B.D. Nordlund P. Sundstrom M. Weigelt J. Edwards A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 15835-15840Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This methodology takes advantage of the well documented phenomenon of enhanced thermal stability of the protein in the presence of a specifically bound ligand (27.Shrake A. Ross P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5055-5059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecules that had a stabilizing effect were further assessed for the effector role for IclR using biophysical and functional assays. DNA Manipulations and Gene Cloning−Standard methods were used for site-directed mutagenesis, chromosomal DNA isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were isolated using spin miniprep kits (Qiagen), and PCR products were purified using Qiaquick purification kits (Qiagen). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For protein expression and purification the iclR gene was amplified from wild type E. coli BW25113 chromosomal DNA by PCR. To identify the boundaries of the ligand binding domain of IclR, a multiple sequence alignment of IclR and its homologues was performed. The link between the DNA and ligand binding domains in E. coli IclR was predicted to lie between amino acids Ser 98 and Leu 101. Two fragments corresponding to the 176 and 173 C-terminal amino acids were amplified and tested for expression of the soluble domain as previously described (20.Walker J.R. Altamentova S. Ezersky A. Lorca G. Skarina T. Kudritska M. Ball L.J. Bochkarev A. Savchenko A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 810-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The expression of a fragment of iclR corresponding to amino acids 98–274 yielded a soluble domain of IclR (C-IclR) that was used for further experiments. All amplified fragments were cloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of a modified form of pET15b (EMD Biosciences) in which a TEV protease cleavage site replaced the thrombin cleavage site and a double stop codon was introduced downstream from the BamHI site. This construct provides for an N-terminal hexahistidine tag separated from the protein by a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site (ENLYFQ↓GS). Construction of Deletion Mutants−An IclR deletion mutant was generated by the methods described by Datsenko and Wanner (29.Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11405) Google Scholar). To prepare competent cells for transformation, BW25113 (lacIq rrnBT14 ΔlacZWJ16 hsdR514 ΔaraBADAH33 ΔrhaBADLD78; 29) containing pKD46 was cultured at 30 °C in SOB broth (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing 100 μg of ampicillin/ml. When the A600 reached 0.5, the culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min, and the cells were washed 3 times with cold water before being resuspended in 1% of the original culture volume of water. PCR methods were used to amplify the kanamycin resistance gene (km) from pKD4 by using the primers iclRFw (5′-GTTCAACATTAACTCATCGGATCAGTTCAGTAACTATTGCATTAGCTAACGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3′) and iclRrv (5′-GCGATTAACAGACACCCTTATTCTATTGCCACTCAGGTATGATCATATGAATATCCTCCTTA-3′). The PCR products were purified with a Qiagen kit, treated with DpnI, and repurified by electrophoresis. The km gene was transformed into BW25113-competent cells by electroporation (Gene Pulser; pulse controller at 200 ohms, capacitance at 250 microfarads, and voltage at 25 kV). After electroporation, the cells were grown with shaking in 1 ml of SOC (28.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) medium at 37 °C for 1 h, and the cultures were plated onto Luria-Bertani (LB) agar containing 25 μg of kanamycin/ml. The Kmr transformants were purified on new kanamycin-LB plates. The mutants in which the target genes were replaced by the km gene were verified by PCR using the primers iclRcfw (5′-CTCATCGGATCAGTTCAGTAAC-3′) and iclRcrv (5′-CTTATTCTATTGCCACTCAGG-3′). To delete the km gene from the chromosome, pKD46 was removed from the cells by growing the bacteria at 37 °C, and then pCP20, expressing the Flip recombinase, was introduced by transformation. The transformants containing pCP20 were grown overnight with shaking at 42 °C, and the cultures were plated on LB agar without antibiotics. Colonies were tested for sensitivity to kanamycin and ampicillin. crp mutants were constructed by P1 transduction (30.Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments with Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) using the strain JW3320 as donor (National BioResource Project, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan (31.Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H. Mol. Syst. Biol. 2006; 2: 1-11Crossref Scopus (5529) Google Scholar)). Real-time Quantitative PCR Studies−Bacterial cells were cultured in MOPS minimal media (32.Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with 10 mm pyruvate as carbon source, and when required, 10 mm glyoxylate was added. When the A600 reached 0.5, cells were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C. Total RNA was subsequently isolated with RiboPure™-Bacteria (Ambion) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. cDNAs were synthesized with the superscript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions and stored at -80 °C before use. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out on the Applied Biosystems 7300 apparatus (Applied Biosystems) using Platinum® SYBR® Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Primers used for the real-time PCR were as follows: for rrsC, 5′-CAGCCACACTGGAACTGAGA-3′ and 5′-GTTAGCCGGTGCTTCTTCTG-3′; for aceB, 5′-CTGCGTGACCATATTGTTGG-3′ and 5′-CAGGCGTGAGTAAGCATTCA-3′; for aceK, 5′-TTCGTGCCTGCTATCAACTG-3′ and 5′-AGATATTGAGCGGCACCATC-3′. Protein Purification−The His-tagged fusion proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Star(DE3) cells (Stratagene) harboring an extra plasmid encoding three rare tRNAs (AGG and AGA for Arg, ATA for Ile). The cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to an A600 ∼ 0.6, and expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the cells were incubated with shaking at 15 °C overnight. The cells were harvested, resuspended in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm imidazole), flash-frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -70 °C. The thawed cells were lysed by sonication after the addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mm each of PMSF and benzamidine. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 17,000 rpm) and passed through a DE52 column preequilibrated in binding buffer. The flow-through fraction was then applied to a metal chelate affinity column charged with Ni2+. After the column was washed, the protein was eluted from the column in elution buffer (binding buffer with 500 mm imidazole). The hexahistidine tag was then cleaved from the protein by treatment with recombinant His-tagged tobacco etch virus protease. The cleaved protein was then resolved from the cleaved His tag and the His-tagged protease by flowing the mixture through a second Ni2+ column. The purified proteins were dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl and concentrated using a BioMax concentrator (Millipore). Before crystallization, any particulate matter was removed from the sample by passage through a 0.2-μm Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filtration device (Millipore). Selenomethionine-labeled proteins were expressed using the same vector and host strain but in supplemented M9 media (33.Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar). The sample was prepared under the same conditions as the native protein except for the addition of 5 mm β-mercapto-ethanol to the purification buffers. Size-exclusion Chromatography−100 μl of protein sample contained 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 25 μm IclR wild type or its mutant derivatives, and when indicated, 1 mm glyoxylate or 10 mm pyruvate. After 20 min of incubation on ice, samples were injected onto a Superose 12 10/300 GL gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) installed on anA´kta system (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Filtration was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the protein concentration was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. Blue dextran 2000 was used to determine the void volume. A mixture of protein molecular mass standards containingβ-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) was applied to the column under similar conditions. The elution volumes and molecular masses of the protein standards were used to generate a standard curve from which the apparent molecular mass was determined. Crystallization and Data Collection−The primary crystallization condition was determined by a sparse crystallization matrix (Hampton research kits Crystal Screen 1 and PEG/Ion Screen) at room temperature using the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique in 96-well plates. This condition was optimized by varying the pH and the concentration of the solutes. For apoIclR the best crystals were obtained using hanging drops in 0.2 m potassium acetate, pH 7.0, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350 for 2–5 days at room temperature. For diffraction studies, the crystals were flash-frozen with the crystallization buffer plus 30% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. For the complex structures the crystals obtained in the crystallization condition described above were soaked in 10 mm solution of either glyoxylate or pyruvate for 1 h. For diffraction studies, the crystals were flash-frozen with the crystallization buffer plus 25% ethylene glycol as the cryoprotectant. Diffraction data of crystals of C-IclR were collected at 100 K at the 19ID beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The absorption peak and rising inflection point were determined by calculating and plotting f′ and f″ values against energy (34.Evans G. Pettifer R.F. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 82-86Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) from the fluorescence spectrum. The three-wavelength anomalous diffraction data were collected from a Se-Met-substituted protein crystal using an inverse beam strategy. All crystallographic data were measured with the custom-built 3 × 3-tiled CCD (charge-coupled device) detector (35.Westbrook E.M. Naday I. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 244-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The experiment, data collection, visualization, and processing were controlled with the HKL2000 program package (36.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38702) Google Scholar). Statistics of data collection and processing are provided in Table 3. Diffraction data for glyoxylate and pyruvate complexes were collected at home source (Rigaku FR-E generator with Raxis4++ detector), and the data were integrated and scaled with *TREK (37.Pflugrath J.W.

https://openalex.org/W2011648574,"The Escherichia coli protein SlyD is a member of the FK-506-binding protein family of peptidylprolyl isomerases. In addition to its peptidylprolyl isomerase domain, SlyD is composed of a molecular chaperone domain and a C-terminal tail rich in potential metal-binding residues. SlyD interacts with the [NiFe]-hydrogenase accessory protein HypB and contributes to nickel insertion during biosynthesis of the hydrogenase metallocenter. This study examines the HypB-SlyD complex and its significance in hydrogenase activation. Protein variants were prepared to delineate the interface between HypB and SlyD. Complex formation requires the HypB linker region located between the high affinity N-terminal Ni(II) site and the GTPase domain of the protein. In the case of SlyD, the deletion of a short loop in the chaperone domain abrogates the interaction with HypB. Mutations in either protein that disrupt complex formation in vitro also result in deficient hydrogenase production in vivo, indicating that the contact between HypB and SlyD is important for hydrogenase maturation. Surprisingly, SlyD stimulates release of nickel from the high affinity Ni(II)-binding site of HypB, an activity that is also disrupted by mutations that affect complex formation. Furthermore, a SlyD truncation lacking the C-terminal metal-binding tail still interacts with HypB but is deficient in stimulating metal release and is not functional in vivo. These results suggest that SlyD could activate metal release from HypB during metallation of the [NiFe] hydrogenase. The Escherichia coli protein SlyD is a member of the FK-506-binding protein family of peptidylprolyl isomerases. In addition to its peptidylprolyl isomerase domain, SlyD is composed of a molecular chaperone domain and a C-terminal tail rich in potential metal-binding residues. SlyD interacts with the [NiFe]-hydrogenase accessory protein HypB and contributes to nickel insertion during biosynthesis of the hydrogenase metallocenter. This study examines the HypB-SlyD complex and its significance in hydrogenase activation. Protein variants were prepared to delineate the interface between HypB and SlyD. Complex formation requires the HypB linker region located between the high affinity N-terminal Ni(II) site and the GTPase domain of the protein. In the case of SlyD, the deletion of a short loop in the chaperone domain abrogates the interaction with HypB. Mutations in either protein that disrupt complex formation in vitro also result in deficient hydrogenase production in vivo, indicating that the contact between HypB and SlyD is important for hydrogenase maturation. Surprisingly, SlyD stimulates release of nickel from the high affinity Ni(II)-binding site of HypB, an activity that is also disrupted by mutations that affect complex formation. Furthermore, a SlyD truncation lacking the C-terminal metal-binding tail still interacts with HypB but is deficient in stimulating metal release and is not functional in vivo. These results suggest that SlyD could activate metal release from HypB during metallation of the [NiFe] hydrogenase. The assembly of the [NiFe] metallocenter of Escherichia coli hydrogenase 3 requires the participation of proteins encoded by the hyp (hydrogenase pleiotropy) genes hypABCDEF (reviewed in Refs. 1.Casalot L.

Whether one or a combination of these metal sites serve as a source of nickel for the hydrogenase enzyme has not yet been determined. Upon searching for additional hydrogenase biosynthetic factors in E. coli, a protein called SlyD was identified in a complex with HypB and shown to play a role in hydrogenase production (19.Zhang J.W. Butland G. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Zamble D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1994; 269: 2902-2910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In general, PPIases are capable of assisting in various protein folding processes by catalyzing the cis-trans-isomerization of a prolyl amide bond, but in many cases it is not clear that this activity is required for the physiological function of the protein (22.Göthel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 23.Barik S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2889-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). SlyD, like many FKBP PPIases, including the E. coli ribosome-associated trigger factor (24.Scholz C. Stoller G. Zarnt T. Fischer G. Schmid F.X. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and periplasmic FkpA (25.Arié J.-P. Sassoon N. Betton J.-M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), also exhibits general molecular chaperone activity (26.Scholz C. Eckert B. Hagn F. Schaarschmidt P. Balbach J. Schmid F.X. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 20-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SlyD shares with a subset of FKBPs an additional domain, termed IF (insert in the flap), which has been structurally characterized for an archaeal FKBP, MtFKBP17 from Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus, and may allow these proteins to bind unfolded or extended polypeptide chains (27.Suzuki R.

Maruyama T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 453-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although they possess many attributes suitable for a housekeeping chaperone function, some PPIases bind only to a limited set of client proteins and appear to play a regulatory role in specific biochemical pathways (22.Göthel S.F. Marahiel M.A. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 423-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 23.Barik S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2006; 63: 2889-2900Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). One unusual feature of SlyD is that it has a C-terminal 50-residue metal-binding domain. This domain is rich in the metal-binding amino acids, containing 15 histidines, 6 cysteines, and 7 aspartate/glutamate residues (see Fig. 1 for domain architecture), and is required for metal-dependent inhibition of the PPIase activity (29.Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Plückthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). An E. coli strain with a deletion in the slyD gene exhibits reduced nickel accumulation as well as low hydrogenase activity that can be fully restored by the addition of excess nickel to the growth media (19.Zhang J.W. Butland G. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Zamble D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), suggesting that SlyD contributes to the insertion of nickel into apohydrogenase. Unlike many other bacterial HypB proteins, E. coli HypB lacks a polyhistidine stretch that can bind multiple nickel ions and serve in nickel storage (30.Rey L. Imperial J. Palacios J.-M. Ruiz-Argüeso T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6066-6073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Fu C. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1702-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Given that SlyD can bind multiple metal ions (20.Wülfing C. Lombardero J. Plückthun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2895-2901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Hottenrott S. Schumann T. Plückthun A. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.-U. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15697-15701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), it is possible that SlyD has assumed this storage function (19.Zhang J.W. Butland G. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Zamble D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of SlyD in the metallation of apohydrogenase, we examined the SlyD-HypB complex in more detail. The site of interaction was localized in both proteins, and mutants of either HypB or SlyD that fail to form the complex in vitro are defective in activating hydrogenase in vivo. Furthermore, when SlyD binds to HypB it activates metal release from the N-terminal high affinity nickel-binding site. A SlyD variant lacking the C-terminal tail is capable of interacting with HypB but does not contribute to hydrogenase biosynthesis in vivo or stimulate metal release from HypB in vitro. These data support a role beyond nickel storage for SlyD in triggering metal release from HypB and promoting nickel insertion into the hydrogenase precursor protein.

To generate pET-SlyD-(1–146), a fragment of slyD coding for residues 1–146 was amplified from DH5α E. coli by using the D(1–146) primer set (Table 1). After purification with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), the PCR product was digested with the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI. The digested PCR product was isolated from agarose gel pieces by using a QIAquick kit (Qiagen) and ligated into the pET24b vector digested with NdeI and XhoI and dephosphorylated with calf intestine phosphatase. Ligation products were transformed into XL-2 Blue E. coli (Stratagene). For in vivo experiments hypB was amplified from pET24b-HypB using the BpBAD primer set, and a fragment of slyD coding for residues 1–146 was amplified from DH5α E. coli using the D(1–146) pBAD primer set. PCR products were treated as described above, except they were digested with the restriction enzymes NheI and XbaI and ligated into the pBAD24 vector digested with the same enzymes, to generate pBAD-HypB and pBAD-SlyD-(1–146), respectively. To generate a construct coding for a fusion between the maltose-binding protein (MBP) and the C-terminal tail of SlyD, a fragment of slyD coding for residues 140–196 was amplified with the primer set D(140–196). The purified PCR product was treated as described above, digested with NdeI and XhoI, and ligated into the vector pIADL16 ((34.McCafferty D.G. Lessard I.A.D. Walsh C.T.

Plasmids coding for amino acid variants and deletion variants were generated by QuikChange PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene) using Pfu polymerase and pET-HypB, pBAD-HypB, pET-SlyD, and pBAD-SlyD as templates. The primers used to prepare HypB(P29S,P32S), HypB(28d36), HypB(11d76), HypB(19d76), and SlyD(Δflap) (producing a deletion of residues 107–111) are shown in Table 1. Parent plasmids were digested with DpnI before transforming the reaction mix into competent cells. For routine handling, plasmids were transformed into XL-2 Blue E. coli and isolated by using the Qiagen plasmid mini- or midi-prep kits. All plasmids were sequenced in the forward and reverse directions to verify the cloned sequences and mutations (ACGT, Toronto, Canada). Protein Purification−HypB and HypB mutants were expressed in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells grown in media containing 1 mm Ni(II) (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified by sequential DEAE, HiTrapQ, and Superdex S-200 columns, as described previously (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and stored at –80 °C in the Superdex buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm TCEP). To determine the oligomeric state of HypB, the purified protein was run on an S-200 gel filtration column calibrated with β-amylase (200 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.5 kDa), chicken ovalbumin (45 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa) as standards. HypB (31.6 kDa) elutes at a volume consistent with a molecular mass of 65 kDa, demonstrating that it is a dimer under these conditions, in contrast to our previously reported experiments using an S-75 gel filtration column (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but in agreement with other studies (15.Mehta N. Olson J.W. Maier R.J. J.

SlyD variants were expressed in a ΔslyD BL21(DE3) strain of E. coli prepared as described for ΔslyD in other genetic backgrounds (19.Zhang J.W. Butland G. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Zamble D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SlyD and SlyD variants were purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography followed by anion exchange on a MonoQ column and gel filtration on a Superdex S-200 essentially as described previously (19.Zhang J.W. Butland G. Greenblatt J.F. Emili A. Zamble D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4360-4366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As SlyD-(1–146) lacks the polyhistidine tail, the initial nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was replaced with a DEAE column. Protein concentrations were estimated using their ε280 values as predicted by the ExPASy Protparam program for the fully reduced proteins (36.Gasteiger E. Hoogland C. Gattiker A. Duvaud S. Wilkins M.R. Appel R.D. Bairoch A. Walker J.M. The Proteomics Protocols Handbook. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2005: 571-607Crossref Google Scholar). Protein molecular weights were determined by ESI-MS and compared with the predicted values. The data were consistent with the loss of the N-terminal Met for all HypB variants except the GTPase domain as follows: HypB(P29S,P32S) 31,412.0 Da (predicted 31,413.7 Da), HypB(28d36) 30,554.0 Da (predicted 30,554.8 Da), HypB(19d76) 25,186.0 Da (predicted 25,186.8), and HypB(11d76) 24,250.0 Da (predicted 24,252.9 Da.). ESI-MS data for HypB and the GTPase domain were as reported (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Data for SlyD and its variants were consistent with retention of the N-terminal methionine as follows: SlyD 20,853.0 Da (predicted 20,852.8 Da), SlyD-(1–146) 15,833.2 Da (predicted 15, 833.6 Da), and SlyD(Δflap) 20,338.0 Da (predicted 20,339.2 Da). The observed molecular weight of the MBP-SlyD-(140–196) fusion protein was consistent with removal of the N-terminal Met, 48,796.0 Da (predicted 48,797.4 Da). Iodoacetamide Modification of SlyD−Purified SlyD (1 ml of 500 μm) was treated with 2 mm TCEP for 20 min and then with 50 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min with stirring at room temperature. The sample was then dialyzed against two changes of buffer (3 liters of 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.6) to remove the modification reagent and analyzed by ESI-MS before use. Modified SlyD has a mass of 21,196.0 Da consistent with all six cysteines having a carbamidomethyl modification (predicted 21,195.2 Da). Circular Dichroism−CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter with an optical path length of 1 mm. The protein concentrations were 10–30 μm in 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. GTPase Activity−To assay GTPase activity, released phosphate was detected by using Malachite Green in the presence of ammonium molybdate based on an adaptation of a published method as described previously (14.Leach M.R.

Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar). PPIase Activity−A protease-free assay was used to measure the PPIase activity of SlyD and the variants (38.Janowski B. Wollner S. Schutkowski M. Fischer G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 252: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The substrate, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-nitroanilide (Bachem Bioscience), was dissolved in trifluoroethanol that had been dried over sieves and 0.47 m LiCl. The reactions contained 35 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, and 1 μm protein and were incubated at 10 °C prior to the addition of 71 μm substrate. Isomerization was monitored at 330 nm on a Cintra 40 spectrophotometer and fit to a single exponential decay. The uncatalyzed rate was also measured, and the second-order rate constant was calculated as follows: kcat/Km = (kobs – kuncat)/[enzyme]. Metal Binding and EGTA Competition−For all HypB variants we initially investigated whether the purified proteins had an electronic absorption band at 320 nm, which is diagnostic for bound nickel, and then prepared apoprotein from each of these proteins to test whether they bind stoichiometric nickel with an affinity comparable with wild-type HypB (Table 2) (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purified HypB variants were incubated with 20 mm EDTA and 2 mm TCEP in an anaerobic glove box for 72 h. The proteins were gel filtered twice through PD-10 columns equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl. To test their reduction state, all apoproteins were treated with DTNB after dilution into 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, and the absorbance at 412 nm was compared with a β-mercaptoethanol standard curve. In all cases the reduction state was >95%. The apoproteins were incubated with Ni(II) in the absence or presence of 5 mm EGTA overnight at 4 °C, and samples were removed from the glove box to measure the UV-visible absorbance spectra. The data were treated as described previously (14.Leach M.R. Sandal S. Sun H. Zamble D.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 12229-12238Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).TABLE 2Metal-binding characteristics of HypB variantsName∈320 valueaData were measured by using direct titration with Ni(II). In some cases metal analysis of Ni(II)-HypB was also performed on protein incubated with nickel followed by gel filtration, and the extinction coefficients at 320 nm were within 5% of the listed values.Kdm-1 cm-1mHypB(7.3 ± 0.1) × 103(1.3 ± 0.2) × 10-13HypB(P29S,P32S)(7.5 ± 0.3) × 103(1.2 ± 0.2) × 10-13HypB(28d36)(7.4 ± 0.2) × 103(1.0 ± 0.4) × 10-13HypB(19d76)(8.5 ± 0.5) × 103(1.9 ± 0.3) × 10-13HypB(11d76)(10.2 ± 0.3) × 103(1.8 ± 0.4) × 10-13a Data were measured by using direct titration with Ni(II). In some cases metal analysis of Ni(II)-HypB was also performed on protein incubated with nickel followed by gel filtration, and the extinction coefficients at 320 nm were within 5% of the listed values. Open table in a new tab Metal Release Assay−HypB, as purified, was diluted to a final protein concentration of 5 μm into 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl (buffer A) containing 100 μm PAR. The release of metal was monitored every 5 min by an increase in the absorbance at 500 nm due to the formation of the metal-PAR2 complex (39.Hunt J.B. Neece S.H. Ginsburg A. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 146: 150-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To determine total metal in the sample (Amax), an aliquot of the same sample was treated with 100 μm parahydroxymercuribenzoic acid, and the data were converted to % metal bound (100 × (1 –(A/Amax))) at a given time point and then fit to a single exponential decay equation. Data of koff versus SlyD were fit to a saturation equation to estimate the maximal metal release rate. The concentration of SlyD was then adjusted for the amount bound to HypB, assuming 1:1 binding, to yield the free SlyD concentration. These data were then fit to a saturation equation,koff=koffmax([SlyD])/(Kd+[SlyD]). Molecular Chaperone Assays−The ability to suppress aggregation of citrate synthase (CS) was used as an assay of general molecular chaperone activity (40.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Chemically denatured, reduced CS (CSden/red) was prepared by desalting an ammonium sulfate preparation (Sigma) that was first diluted 4-fold with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, by using a PD-10 column pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. CS-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and adjusted to 40 μm based on the monomeric mass of 48,969 Da and the published extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 1.78 absorbance units for a 1 mg/ml solution (40.Buchner J. Grallert H. Jakob U. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 290: 323-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The CS stock was chemically denatured and reduced by diluting the protein 4-fold in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride and 25 mm dithiothreitol and incubating at room temperature for 2 h. For each aggregation assay 5 μl of CSden/red was diluted with 500 μl of buffer A (to a final concentration of 0.1 μm) in the presence or absence of SlyD or a SlyD variant at a 20:1 ratio (2 μm). Aggregation was monitored on a fluorimeter (Jobin Yvon) with λex and λem both set at 500 nm and slit widths set at 2 nm. To assay for CS reactivation, 2 μl of CSden/red was diluted in 100 μl of buffer A (to a final concentration of 0.2 μm) in the presence or absence of SlyD or a SlyD variant at a 20:1 ratio (4 μm). After 2 h, a 2-μl aliquot was removed and assayed for CS activity by diluting into 98 μl of reaction mixture (93 μl of 50 mm Tris, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 3 μl of 5 mm acetyl-CoA, 1 μl of 10 mm oxaloacetic acid, and 1 μl of 10 mm DTNB). The reaction was monitored at 412 nm because of the reaction of CoASH with DTNB, and the initial rate was compared with that of a control reaction performed with an equivalent amount of untreated CS, defined as 100% activity. Chemical Cross-linking−Purified HypB (8–10 μm), SlyD (10–40 μm), or the appropriate variant proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C in 10 μl of buffer A. 1-Ethyl-3-[3-dimethylamino-propyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was then added to a concentration of 5 mm, and the samples were further incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and stained wi"

Decorin is an extracellular matrix proteoglycan involved in collagen type I fibril formation and collagen matrix assembly in a wide range of connective tissues (1.Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D.

The decorin core protein is composed of 12 tandem leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), each containing an average of 24 amino acid residues. The decorin three-dimensional structure, resolved by x-ray crystallography, reveals an arch-shaped molecule with LRRs composed of parallel β-sheets on the concave surface and short β-strands, 310 helices, and polyproline II helices on the convex face (10.Scott P.G.

Close to the N terminus, decorin is substituted with a single chondroitin or dermatan sulfate chain. Decorin also has three potential consensus sites for N-glycosylation in the LRR domain (4.Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Several SLRPs are involved in the regulation of collagen fibril formation and matrix assembly, as demonstrated in SLRP-deficient mice (11.Ameye L. Young M.F. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 107R-116RCrossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Decorin deficiency causes skin fragility (12.Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J.

In all these cases, ultrastructural imaging reveals abnormally developed collagen fibrils. Decorin presumably affects the lateral association of collagen type I fibrils in vitro as it binds to collagen monomers and delays their accretion to the growing fibrils (1.Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Collagen fibrils in the skin of decorin-deficient mice are thicker and irregularly shaped, in contrast to smaller, uniform fibrils formed in wild type mice (12.Danielson K.G. Baribault H. Holmes D.F. Graham H. Kadler K.E. Iozzo R.V. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 729-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Decorin binds near the C terminus of collagen, close to an intermolecular cross-linking site (16.Keene D.R. San Antonio J.D. Mayne R. McQuillan D.J. Sarris G. Santoro S.A. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21801-21804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and seems to have a tutelary function in collagen fibril assembly, which is important for the collagen cross-linking. In addition, decorin also binds collagen type VI (17.Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), transforming growth factor-β (18.Hildebrand A. Romaris M. Rasmussen L.M. Heinegard D. Twardzik D.R. Border W.A. Ruoslahti E.

Chem. 1999; 274: 4489-4492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). The precise decorin-binding site for collagen has not been determined. An early study identified two collagen-binding sites in decorin (21.Schonherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A later report assigned a collagen-binding site to LRR 5–6 (22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) and Glu-180 in decorin LRR 5 (Glu-180 in human decorin corresponds to Glu-181 in the bovine sequence) was proposed to be essential for the interaction (23.Kresse H. Liszio C. Schonherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Decorin with an E180Q mutation was later demonstrated to bind more strongly to collagen type VI than wild type decorin, and amino acid residues located C-terminal of Gln-153 in decorin were implicated in the collagen binding (24.Nareyeck G. Seidler D.G. Troyer D. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Schonherr E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to the core protein, the dermatan sulfate chain has also been reported to be involved in the collagen interaction (25.Liu X. Yeh M.I. Lewis J.L. Luo Z.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 1342-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This glycosaminoglycan-collagen interaction is weaker than the core protein-collagen interactions (22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23.Kresse H. Liszio C. Schonherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2004; 271: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is of interest to characterize this prototype decorin-collagen interaction since other SLRPs, e.g. fibromodulin and lumican, also interact with fibrillar collagens and affect connective tissue properties in similar ways. The concerted action of several SLRPs can determine the structure and function of collagen matrices. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of decorin LRR 5–6 to clarify the location of the collagen-binding site. Expression of GST-tagged bacDCN56 in Bacteria−Bovine decorin cDNA (GenBank™ accession number NM_173906) was used as a template in PCR to amplify cDNA encoding LRR 5–6 of decorin. The primers used for the PCR were: 5′-AAAGGATCCAACGAGATCACCAAAGTGCG-3′ and 5′-AAACCCGGGTATATTTGTGTCAGCAATGCG-3′. The amplified cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes BamHI and SmaI and ligated into the vector pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). The construct was sequenced to confirm the identity and transfected into BL21 Escherichia coli, and bacDCN56 protein was expressed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. bacDCN56 was purified under native conditions by glutathione affinity chromatography, as described previously (26.Frangioni J.V. Neel B.G. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar), and dialyzed against PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 prior to use. The protein concentration was determined with Coomassie protein assay reagent (Pierce). Expression of His-tagged Fibromodulin in Bacteria−Bovine fibromodulin cDNA (GenBank accession number X16485) was used as a template in PCR to amplify fibromodulin cDNA. The primers used for the PCR were: 5′-CCGGATCCCCAATATGAGGAAGACTCTCAC-3′ and 5′-CCCTCGAGGATCTCGATGAGGCTAGCC-3′. The amplified cDNA was digested with XhoI and BamHI restriction enzymes and ligated into a pET-27b(+) expression vector (Novagen), and the His-tagged protein was expressed in Rosetta cells (Novagen). Fibromodulin was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prior to use, the protein was dialyzed against PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Site-directed Mutagenesis−bacDCN56 cDNA and bovine decorin cDNA (GenBank accession number NM_173906) were used for site-directed mutagenesis using QuikChange II kit and pBluescript® II KS (+/–) cloning vector (both from Stratagene) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Mutations of bacDCN56, used in bacterial protein expression, were the following: E162Q, E181K, E181Q, T184V, E193Q, Y205F, R207S, D210N. Mutations of bovine decorin, used for mammalian cell protein expression, were the following: E181K, R207S, and D210N. Primers used for mutagenesis are listed in supplemental Fig. 1. Mammalian Expression of Wild Type Decorin and Mutated Decorins−Wild type or mutated decorin cDNA was digested with the restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI and ligated into the pCEP4 BM40-hisEK expression vector (27.Bengtsson E. Aspberg A. Heinegard D. Sommarin Y. Spillmann D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40695-40702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), attaching the decorin cDNA to His tag DNA in the N terminus. The constructs were sequenced to confirm identity and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by electroporation, as described (22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). After 24 h, hygromycin (InvivoGen) was added to a concentration of 150 μg/ml. After 1 week, single clones were picked, incubated in medium containing [35S]sulfate, and analyzed for proteoglycan expression, as described (22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The proteoglycan-expressing clones were cultured in EX-Cell 325 PF Chinese hamster ovary protein-free medium (JRH Biosciences) for 12 days with four medium changes every 3 days. The medium was dialyzed against 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0), and proteoglycans were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose (Qiagen) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 8.0). Peptide Synthesis−Peptides SYIRIADTNIT and SYISIANTNIT were purchased from Schafer-N and dissolved in PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. Solution-phase Collagen Binding Assay−Collagen binding assays were performed by the incubation of 15 μg of acetic acid-extracted mouse tail collagen in 100 μl of PBS, pH 7.4, with the addition of different concentrations of radiolabeled decorin, as described previously (17.Bidanset D.J. Guidry C. Rosenberg L.C. Choi H.U. Timpl R. Hook M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5250-5256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutralization of acid solubilized collagen leads to the formation of collagen fibrils, which bind decorin. After incubation for 5 h at 37 °C, samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 × g to separate collagen fibrils with bound decorin in the pellet from non-bound decorin in the supernatant. More than 90% of the collagen was recovered as fibrils in the pellet. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed once with 1 ml of PBS. The pellet and the supernatant were then electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE, and the amount of radiolabeled proteoglycans was determined in a FLA-3000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). The data were analyzed by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 3 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.). Solid-phase Collagen Binding Assay−Microtiter 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) were coated for 16 h using 10 μg/ml acetic acid-extracted mouse tail collagen in acetic acid. The wells were washed with PBS and blocked for 1 h with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20. After a single wash using PBS with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 (wash buffer), the GST-decorin fusion proteins were added, and after 3 h, the wells were washed five times with the wash buffer. The amounts of GST fusion proteins bound to collagen were determined using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione, as described previously (28.Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A similar procedure was followed for assays with His-tagged full-length decorin and decorin mutants, but the detection was done with rabbit anti-His tag antibody ab9108 (Abcam) diluted 1:250 in the wash buffer, swine anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody (DAKO) diluted 1:500 in the wash buffer, and detection with phosphatase substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). For peptide inhibition assays, the peptide in different concentrations was added to decorin or fibromodulin prior to incubation. Collagen Fibrillogenesis Assay−The assays were performed as described previously (29.Kvist A.J. Johnson A.E. Mörgelin M. Gustafsson E. Bengtsson E. Lindblom K. Aszodi A. Fässler R. Sasaki T. Timpl R. Aspberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 33127-33139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Pepsin-extracted acid-solubilized collagen (Vitrogen) was neutralized and diluted (167 pm) in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with decorin or mutated decorins at 4 °C. Solutions were degassed and then incubated at 37 °C for 10 h in a spectrophotometer where the absorbance was continuously recorded at 400 nm. To study the interaction between decorin and collagen type I, we initially expressed decorin LRR 5–6, previously shown to bind collagen (22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 23.Kresse H. Liszio C. Schonherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), as a GST fusion protein in bacteria (bacDCN56). This fusion protein inhibited the binding of mammalian-expressed full-length [35S]decorin to collagen in solution, indicating that they bind to the same site on collagen (Fig. 1). This confirms the collagen binding properties of bacDCN56, which was used in the further characterization of the decorin-collagen interaction. To identify the amino acid residues involved in the interaction we performed site-directed mutagenesis. We selected residues in bacDCN56 that were either charged and conserved between species or polar and conserved between species, and also exposed on the exterior of the protein (Fig. 2). Thus, the mutations E162Q, E181K, E181Q, T184V, E193Q, Y205F, R207S, and D210N were introduced into bacDCN56 and expressed in E. coli. The binding of the mutated decorin fragments was determined using a solid-phase binding assay. bacE162Q, bacE181K, bacE181Q, bacT184V, bacE193Q, and bacY205F showed similar binding properties as the control (non-mutated) bacDCN56. In contrast, bacR207S and bacD210N had lower affinity for collagen (Fig. 3).FIGURE 2Decorin structure and mutations.

The collagen affinities of the mutated decorins were determined in a solution-phase collagen binding assay in which the collagen molecules presumably form fibrils during the incubation at 37 °C. Wild type decorin has a sigmoidal binding curve (KD = 60 nm), whereas all mutated decorins have linear binding curves, indicating nonspecific binding (Fig. 4). In a solid-phase assay, wild type decorin also has a sigmoidal binding curve with KD = 6nm, whereas extrapolation of the linear binding curves for mutated decorins gives KD = 350 nm for mamE181K, KD = 1mm for mamR207S, and KD = 1mm for mamD210N (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Solid phase collagen binding of mammalian-expressed full-length decorin variants. 96-well plastic plates were coated with acetic acid-extracted collagen type I and incubated with increasing concentrations of wild type decorin (▪), mamE181K (▴), mamR207S (○), and mamD210N (•).

In a solid-phase assay, the peptide inhibited the decorin-collagen interaction at Ki = 4 μm, whereas the collagen-fibromodulin interaction was unaffected. The control peptide SYISIANTNIT, with R207S and D210N mutations, did not inhibit the decorin-collagen binding (Fig. 6). We also analyzed how the mutations R207S and D210N affected the collagen fibrillogenesis in vitro. The incubation of acid solubilized collagen with decorin at neutral pH and 37 °C leads to a slower collagen fibril formation and a lower final turbidity (1.Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). 2 μg/ml decorin completely inhibited the formation of fibrils and 1 μg/ml inhibited the formation of fibrils by ∼50% (Fig. 7). The incubation of collagen in the presence of mamD210N at 2 and 1 μg/ml affected the fibrillogenesis only marginally. mamR207S at 2 μg/ml resulted in ∼50% inhibition of fibrillogenesis. Also, the peptide SYIRIADTNIT at 150 μg/ml lowered the turbidity significantly, whereas the control peptide at the same concentration had no effect. We show that decorin LRR 5–6 domain, encompassing Arg-207 and Asp-210, is of importance for collagen binding. Mutations of these 2 amino acid residues impaired binding to reconstituted collagen fibrils in solution and monomeric collagen adsorbed on plastic surface. Glu-181 (Glu-180 in human decorin corresponds to Glu-181 in the bovine sequence) was previously reported to be essential for the collagen interaction (23.Kresse H. Liszio C. Schonherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and, interestingly, the E181K and E181Q mutations expressed as GST fusion proteins in bacteria did not impair binding to monomeric collagen-coated surfaces. However, mammalian full-length E181K decorin lost the affinity for collagen. This discrepancy may be due to structural changes induced by the E181K and E181Q mutations rather than direct involvement of Glu-181 in collagen binding. The crystal structure of decorin indicates that the side chain of Glu-181 potentially forms hydrogen bonds with the side chains of Arg-207 and His-159 on the neighboring LRR domains. Glu-181 also forms a hydrogen bond with the peptide bond of the proximal β-sheet (10.Scott P.G. McEwan P.A. Dodd C.M. Bergmann E.M. Bishop P.N. Bella J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 15633-15638Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Consequently, mutation of this glutamate residue may lead to misfolding of the protein core, and collagen-binding sites could be sterically hindered from interaction in full-length decorin. We used the program CUPSAT (30.Parthiban V. Grohima M.M. Schomburg D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: W239-W242Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) to predict changes in protein stability upon point mutations. The E181K mutation has a destabilized structure and an unfavorable torsion, with predicted ΔΔG =–5.5 kcal/mol. Also, the R207S mutation has an unfavorable ΔΔG =–1.66 kcal/mol, which could indirectly impair collagen binding. In contrast, the D210N mutation has ΔΔG = 0.2 kcal/mol, not affecting the structure. The misfolding of decorin may also explain the reduction in amount of E181K-mutated decorin synthesized by 293 cells as the protein is presumably retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not properly secreted. After screening of several clones of 293 cells transformed with mamE181K, we could not identify clones expressing large amounts of mamE181K (data not shown). In bacE181K, only two LRRs are expressed, and the collagen-binding site possibly remains exposed for interaction. The crystal structure of decorin indicates that the Asp-210 side chain does not form intramolecular hydrogen bonds, has a high solvent exposure (60%, according to CUPSAT analysis), and is not involved in the putative dimer formation. On the other hand, both Glu-181 and Arg-207 are less exposed to solvent (2 and 22% respectively), buried within the putative dimer contact surface, and have potential structure-stabilizing intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Our results indicate that Asp-210 directly contributes to the collagen binding, whereas the Arg-207 and Glu-181 may have structural functions. Indeed, sequence alignment of decorin LRR 5–6 sequences in 15 species reveals conservation of these 3 amino acids, emphasizing their structural role and involvement in collagen binding (supplemental Fig. 2). Notably, amino acid residues in other LRR proteins involved in interactions are positioned in the same region of the leucine-rich repeat as the decorin Asp-210; e.g. Asp-175 and Glu-128 of glycoprotein Ib are critical for complex formation with von Willebrand factor (31.Shimizu A. Matsushita T. Kondo T. Inden Y. Kojima T. Saito H. Hirai M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16285-16294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and Asp-435 of ribonuclease inhibitor is crucial for binding RNase A and angiogenin (32.Chen C.Z. Shapiro R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 1761-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In analogy with decorin, these charged amino acids are positioned in the β-sheet-loop region of the LRR domain, and the side chains are exposed to solvent. Similar location of binding sites can be found in other LRR proteins (33.Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar), implying conserved binding patterns. The peptide sequence SYIRIADTNIT is located in LRR 6 of decorin and includes the residues Arg-207 and Asp-210. This peptide inhibits the decorin-collagen type I interaction at Ki = 4 μm. Although this makes the peptide a potent inhibitor of decorin-collagen interaction, the inhibition is not complete. This implies the existence of other, seemingly weaker, collagen-binding sites in decorin and agrees with previous reports (21.Schonherr E. Hausser H. Beavan L. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8877-8883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22.Svensson L. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20712-20716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 24.Nareyeck G. Seidler D.G. Troyer D. Rauterberg J. Kresse H. Schonherr E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 3389-3398Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Also, binding of mutated decorins to collagen indicates the presence of multiple binding sites in decorin (Figs. 4 and 5). The mutated decorins have linear binding curves, as opposed to sigmoidal binding curve of wild type decorin, which indicates weak or nonspecific binding. Since it is conceivable that the glycosaminoglycan chain could also contribute to collagen binding, we assessed the binding of chondroitinase ABC-treated decorin in the solid-phase assay and compared it with decorin proteoglycan. Both decorins had similar collagen binding, suggesting minor contribution by the glycosaminoglycan chain in collagen binding (data not shown). We also investigated how mutated decorins and synthetic peptides affect collagen fibrillogenesis. It has been demonstrated that decorin inhibits the rate of collagen fibril formation in vitro and reduces the turbidity of the formed fibrils (1.Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegard D. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 587-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). It is believed that decorin binds collagen and interferes with the lateral growth of fibrils. The reduction in turbidity is primarily due to the formation of thinner collagen fibrils in the presence of decorin. Our results show that decorin dramatically inhibits fibrillogenesis at a collagen:decorin molar ratio of 1:8 (collagen molecular mass 300 kDa and decorin molecular mass 100 kDa) (Fig. 7). mamR207S also significantly inhibits fibrillogenesis at a molar ratio of 1:8, although not as efficiently as decorin. This may be explained by the collagen binding mediated by Asp-210 in mamR207S. Also, mamD210N retains some inhibition of fibril formation, which indicates additional collagen-binding sites, not involving Asp-210 and Arg-207. Interestingly, the synthetic peptide SYIRIADTNIT also showed inhibition of collagen fibril formation when present at high concentrations. A collagen:peptide molar ratio of 1:360 (collagen molecular mass 300 kDa and peptide molecular mass 1.3 kDa) resulted in 25% inhibition of fibril formation. The control peptide SYISIANTNIT did not interfere with the fibril formation. Apparently, the synthetic peptide SYIRIADTNIT has the capacity to bind collagen and interfere with the lateral growth of fibrils. The collagen-binding site of decorin is homologous to sequences in asporin and biglycan, which are the closest relatives of decorin and belong to the same SLRP subfamily. The decorin sequence SYIRIADTNIT is partially conserved in the asporin sequence HIRIAEAKLT and in the biglycan sequence NYLRISEAKLT. The sequences are located in LRR 6, and their collagen binding properties are unknown. Download .pdf (.19 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2022828121,"Prostate tumors are initially dependent on androgens for growth, but the majority of patients treated with anti-androgen therapy progress to androgen-independence characterized by resistance to such treatment. This study investigates a novel role for filamin A (FlnA), a 280 kDa cytoskeletal protein (consisting of an actin-binding domain (ABD) followed by 24 sequential repeats), in androgen-independent (AI) growth. Full-length FlnA is cleaved to 170 kDa (ABD+FlnA1–15) and 110 kDa fragments (FlnA16–24); the latter is further cleaved to a 90 kDa fragment (repeats 16–23) capable of nuclear translocation and androgen receptor (AR) binding. Here, we demonstrate that in androgen-dependent LNCaP prostate cancer cells, the cleaved 90 kDa fragment is localized to the nucleus, whereas in its AI subline C4–2, FlnA failed to cleave and remained cytoplasmic. Transfection of FlnA16–24 cDNA in C4–2 cells restored expression and nuclear localization of 90 kDa FlnA. Unlike LNCaP, C4–2 cells proliferate in androgen-reduced medium and in the presence of the AR-antagonist Casodex. They also exhibit increased Akt phosphorylation compared to LNCaP, which may contribute to their AI phenotype. Nuclear expression of 90 kDa FlnA in C4–2 cells decreased Akt phosphorylation, prevented proliferation in androgen-reduced medium and restored Casodex sensitivity. This effect was inhibited by constitutive activation of Akt indicating that FlnA restored Casodex sensitivity in C4–2 cells by decreasing Akt phosphorylation. In addition, FlnA-specific siRNA which depleted FlnA levels, but not control siRNA, induced resistance to Casodex in LNCaP cells. Our results demonstrate that expression of nuclear FlnA is necessary for androgen dependence in these cells."

https://openalex.org/W2011801710,"Pfs48/45, a member of a Plasmodium-specific protein family, displays conformation-dependent epitopes and is an important target for malaria transmission-blocking (TB) immunity. To design a recombinant Pfs48/45-based TB vaccine, we analyzed the conformational TB epitopes of Pfs48/45. The Pfs48/45 protein was found to consist of a C-terminal six-cysteine module recognized by anti-epitope I antibodies, a middle four-cysteine module recognized by anti-epitopes IIb and III, and an N-terminal module recognized by anti-epitope V antibodies. Refolding assays identified that a fragment of 10 cysteines (10C), comprising the middle four-cysteine and the C-terminal six-cysteine modules, possesses superior refolding capacity. The refolded and partially purified 10C conformer elicited antibodies in mice that targeted at least two of the TB epitopes (I and III). The induced antibodies could block the fertilization of Plasmodium falciparum gametes in vivo in a concentration-dependent manner. Our results provide important insight into the structural organization of the Pfs48/45 protein and experimental support for a Pfs48/45-based subunit vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W2057908150,"Oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD) is a congenital autosomal dominant disorder with phenotypic variability, which has been associated with mutations in the GJA1 gene encoding connexin43 (Cx43). Given that Cx43 mutants are thought to be equally co-expressed with wild-type Cx43 in ODDD patients, it is imperative to examine the consequence of these mutants in model systems that reflect this molar ratio. To that end, we used differential fluorescent protein tagging of mutant and wild-type Cx43 to quantitatively monitor the ratio of mutant/wild-type within the same putative gap junction plaques and co-immunoprecipitation to determine if the mutants interact with wild-type Cx43. Together the fluorescence-based assay was combined with patch clamp analysis to assess the dominant negative potency of Cx43 mutants. Our results revealed that the ODDD-linked Cx43 mutants, G21R and G138R, as well as amino terminus green fluorescent protein-tagged Cx43, were able to co-localize with wild-type Cx43 at the gap junction plaque-like structures and to co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type Cx43. All Cx43 mutants demonstrated dominant negative action on gap junctional conductance of wild-type Cx43 but not that of Cx32. More interestingly, these Cx43 mutants demonstrated different potencies in inhibiting the function of wild-type Cx43 with the G21R mutant being two times more potent than the G138R mutant.

Gap junctions (GJ) 3The abbreviations used are: GJ, gap junction; GJIC, gap junctional intercellular communication; ODDD, oculodentodigital dysplasia; mRFP, monomeric red fluorescent protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NRK, normal rat kidney; ROIs, regions of interest. are membrane channels that allow direct cell-to-cell transfer of ions, signaling molecules and metabolites of <1 kDa in size. Gap junction proteins, connexins, oligomerize to form connexons (hemichannels) that dock with connexons from the contacting cell to form gap junction channels (1Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B. Cell. 1996; 84: 381-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1645) Google Scholar). At the cell-cell interface, hundreds to thousands of gap junction channels cluster to form gap junction plaques (2Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). There are 21 members in the human connexin family, all of which share a common membrane topology. Every connexin consists of four transmembrane domains (M1 to M4), two extracellular loops (EL-1 and EL-2), and one intracellular loop (IL) with both the amino terminus (AT) and carboxyl terminus (CT) exposed to the cytoplasm (3Laird D.W. Revel J.P. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 109-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Falk M.M. Buehler L.K. Kumar N.M. Gilula N.B.

Connexins are expressed in a tissue- and developmental stage-dependent manner, and many cells express multiple connexin isoforms. Connexins of the same kind oligomerize to form homomeric hemichannels, whereas oligomerization of compatible connexins of different isoforms can form heteromeric hemichannels. Moreover, both homotypic and heterotypic intercellular gap junction channels exist in native tissues (7Evans W.H. Martin P.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2002; 19: 121-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 8Cottrell G.T. Burt J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1711: 126-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This diversity in channel composition reflects the complex nature of gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC), which in turn, plays important roles in many physiological and developmental processes (2Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The expression of dominant negative variants of proteins has been successfully used to elucidate protein function, not only within the context of composite cellular and tissue organizations, but also within protein complexes (9Herskowitz I. Nature. 1987; 329: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 10Sheppard D. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1994; 11: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Given the oligomeric nature of gap junction channels, a mutant connexin subunit that is still capable of oligomerization might exert dominant negative effects on GJIC, if it were to associate with wild-type gap junction proteins. Hence, disease-linked mutant connexins are ideal candidates for exerting dominant negative effects on compatible wild-type connexins. Interestingly, many diseases linked to connexin mutations are autosomal dominant leading to speculation that the mutant encoded by one allele is dominant to the co-expressed wild-type connexin (11Kelsell D.P. Di W.L. Houseman M.J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 68: 559-568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 12Chang E.H. Van Camp G. Smith R.J. Ear.

One newly characterized connexin-linked human disease is oculodentodigital dysplasia (ODDD). ODDD is a rare inherited disorder affecting the development of the face, teeth, eyes, and limbs, where patients display symptoms of congenital craniofacial deformities and limb abnormalities (14Paznekas W.A. Boyadjiev S.A. Shapiro R.E. Daniels O. Wollnik B. Keegan C.E. Innis J.W. Dinulos M.B. Christian C. Hannibal M.C. Jabs E.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2003; 72: 408-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The majority of the ODDD cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion (15Frasson M. Calixto N. Cronemberger S. de Aguiar R.A. Leao L.L. de Aguiar M.J. Ophthalmic Genet. 2004; 25: 227-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ODDD has been associated with over 30 known human Cx43 mutations. Thus far, functional studies have been performed on 12 ODDD-linked Cx43 mutants, all of which demonstrated functionally impaired gap junctions when expressed in GJIC-incompetent N2A and/or HeLa cells (16Seki A.

However, different mechanisms appear to be responsible for the loss of Cx43 function, as some mutants display altered trafficking while others show no apparent trafficking defect but exhibit either a complete or partial loss of gap junction channel or hemichannel function (16Seki A.

Interestingly, many ODDD-linked mutants, including G21R and G138R, have been shown to exhibit dominant negative properties on gap junction function in cell lines that express endogenous Cx43 (18Roscoe W.

Our partial characterization of these two ODDD-linked mutants in overexpression models failed to see any difference between G21R and G138R, in terms of trafficking, the formation of gap junction plaque-like structures or their functional status (18Roscoe W.

On the other hand, the patients carrying these two mutants not only displayed several common ODDD symptoms such as digit syndactyly and facial anomalies but also distinct clinical defects possibly reflecting differences that could be attributed to the site of the mutation. For example, a patient with the G21R mutation displayed an atrial-septal defect in the heart, whereas patients harboring the G138R mutation exhibited combinations of neurological disorders, hearing loss, spastic gait, and bladder disorders (14Paznekas W.A.

Based on these clinical observations, we hypothesized that different Cx43 mutants may in fact have different potentials at inhibiting the function of co-expressed wild-type Cx43. To test our hypothesis at the molecular level, it was necessary to establish a differential fluorescent protein tagging strategy where wild-type Cx43 was tagged with monomeric red fluorescent protein (Cx43-mRFP), and Cx43 mutants were tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). In addition, to establish a proof of principle and determine the efficacy of using two distinct fluorescent protein tags, we assessed the effect of a loss-of-function mutant where GFP was tagged to the amino-terminal of Cx43 (GFP-Cx43) on Cx43-mRFP. Fluorescent protein-tagged connexins, where the fluorescent protein is tagged to the carboxyl terminus of the connexin (Cxs-GFP), have been widely used in elucidating the pathways and events linked to connexin assembly, trafficking, localization, function, and degradation (24Jordan K.

For example, when expressed in various cell lines, Cx43-GFP, Cx32-GFP, and Cx26-GFP were all able to traffic to the cell surface and form functional gap junction channels and even propagate calcium waves (24Jordan K.

Likewise, patch clamp recordings revealed that Cx43-GFP channels exhibit similar macroscopic and single channel conductance as those of untagged Cx43, although they are less sensitive to transjunctional voltage and lack fast voltage gating to a residual state (25Bukauskas F.F.

On the other hand, GFP-Cx43 was found to be incapable of forming functional gap junction channels or hemichannels while still being assembled into gap junction-like structures at the cell surface (29Laird D.W.

In this study we combined differential fluorescent protein tagging, co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and electrophysiological recordings to investigate the mechanism of dominant negative action of ODDD-linked Cx43 mutants in a dosage control environment. Our data indicate that the ODDD-linked mutants, G21R and G138R, were both dominant to wild-type Cx43 when expressed at a 1:1 ratio, whereas the G21R mutant was clearly more potent. Collectively, these data support a model where patients harboring the G21R mutant would exhibit less overall Cx43-based GJIC than patients carrying the G138R mutant possibly explaining the differences in overall disease burden. Cell Culture and Reagents—All media, sera, and culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen, BD Biosciences, or Sigma. N2A (mouse neuroblastoma) cells, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells, HeLa (human cervical carcinoma) cells and BICR-M1Rk (rat mammary) tumor cells were cultured as we previously reported (24Jordan K.

The HeLa-Cx32D cell line representing HeLa cells stably expressing Cx32 was kindly provided by Dr. Michael Koval (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA). Engineering of Connexin-chimeric and Mutant Cx43 cDNAs—The vector encoding Cx43-GFP used in this study was constructed as described in Jordan et al. (24Jordan K. Solan J.L. Dominguez M. Sia M. Hand A. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2033-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The engineering of the GFP-Cx43 and Cx32-GFP constructs was described previously (29Laird D.W. Jordan K. Thomas T. Qin H. Fistouris P. Shao Q. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2001; 52: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A and D). To generate the GFP-Cx32 fusion protein, the cDNA of rat Cx32 was amplified by PCR with the forward primer of Cx32 (5′-GCC CTC GAG ATG AAC TGG ACA) to introduce the XhoI site and the reverse primer (5′-GCG GAA TTC GTT AGC AGG) to introduce the EcoRI site. PCR products were digested with XhoI/EcoRI and cloned into the XhoI/EcoRI-cut pEGFP-C3 (Clontech) vector. DNA sequence analysis confirmed that Cx32 was fused in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of GFP with the addition of an amino acid linker encoded by TAC TCA GAT CTC GAG (Fig. 1C). Two human ODDD Cx43 mutants, G21R and G138R, were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as previously described (18Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q.

The monomeric mRFP (variant of DsRed) tagged to the carboxyl terminus of Cx43 (Cx43-mRFP) was kindly provided by Dr. Guido Gaietta (University of California, San Diego, CA) (32Campbell R.E. Tour O.

Transient and Stable Transfection—Cells were transfected with GFP- or mRFP-tagged Cxs by Lipofectamine PLUS or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer (as described in Refs. 18Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E. Shao Q. Kidder G.M. Laird D.W. J. Biol.

In co-transfection experiments, cDNAs of Cx43 mutants (or GFP-Cx43) and Cx43-mRFP were mixed in designed ratios, whereas Cx43-mRFP cDNA was kept constant at 3 μg (20Gong X.Q. Shao Q. Lounsbury C.S.

Because the mRFP sequence was only 14 amino acid residues shorter than the GFP sequence, the calculated ratios of cDNAs used in transfection studies should only be minimally affected. 24-48 h after transient transfection, cells were used for patch clamp recording, microinjection, or fixed for immunocytochemistry. For stable transfection, cells were sub-cultured into selection medium containing previously titrated concentrations of G418, and cell clones were selected as described previously (24Jordan K. Solan J.L. Dominguez M. Sia M. Hand A. Lampe P.D. Laird D.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2033-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Cells were immunolabeled as previously described (33Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on glass cover-slips and fixed with 80% methanol/20% acetone at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells expressing Cx43 or GFP-Cx43 were labeled with a 1:50 dilution of anti-Cx43 monoclonal antibody or polyclonal antibody (specific for the 360-382 peptide segment of Cx43) (33Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Cx32-, GFP-Cx32-, and Cx32-GFP-expressing cells were labeled with 1:2000 dilution of an anti-Cx32 (Ham8) monoclonal antibody, specific for an 11-peptide sequence (229-239) located in the cytoplasmic region of Cx32 (34Fujikura Y. Ohta H. Hirai T. Fukumoto T. Anat. Rec. 1993; 235: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The Ham8 antibody was generously provided by Dr. Fujikura (Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan). Washed cells were incubated for 1 h in goat anti-mouse or donkey anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to Texas red or fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., PA). Coverslips were rinsed in distilled water, mounted, and analyzed as previously described (33Laird D.W. Castillo M. Kasprzak L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Confocal Imaging—All cells expressing GFP-tagged Cxs/mutants or Cx43-mRFP, and cells used for antibody labeling, were fixed as described above and imaged on a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY, USA) LSM 510 META confocal microscope mounted on an inverted Axiovert 200 motorized microscope equipped with a 63× oil (1.4 numerical aperture) objective. Fluorescence signals were imaged after excitation with 488, 543, or 730 nm laser lines produced by argon, heliumneon, or tunable Chameleon multiphoton lasers, respectively. All fluorescence signals were collected on a photomultiplier after a passage through appropriate filter sets. In quantitative analyses, all 12-bit images were taken with identical settings. The regions of interest (ROIs) were carefully selected to include putative gap junctional plaques at cell-cell interfaces. The accuracy of the selected ROIs was double checked at high magnification to ensure that the plaque was properly demarcated, whereas fluorescence intensity measurements were collected from the original images. Based on the fluorescence intensity histograms generated from the ROIs, mean fluorescence densities from both red (mRFP) and green (GFP) channels were determined, and the green/red ratio was calculated. Digital images were prepared using Zeiss LSM, Adobe Photoshop 7.0, and CorelDraw 12 software (31Thomas T. Jordan K. Simek J. Shao Q. Jedeszko C. Walton P. Laird D.W. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 4451-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Expression of GFP-tagged connexins in HeLa cells promotes the formation of oversized gap junctions unlike most gap junctions observed in vivo, which tend to be much smaller. However, these large gap junctions offer a convenient experimental model for imaging and to define regions of interest for our quantitative analysis of connexin intermixing within the plaque, whereas limitations in resolution prevent any assignment of connexins to specific sides of the gap junction plaque. Fluorescent Dye Microinjection—Control cells or cell clusters expressing exogenous fluorescent protein-tagged connexins with clear fluorescent plaques at sites of cell-cell apposition were selected for microinjection. Cells were pressure microinjected with 5% Lucifer yellow (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands) using an Eppendorf FemtoJet automated pressure microinjector and a Leica DM IRE2 inverted epifluorescence microscope. Approximately, 1-4 min after microinjection, digital images were collected with a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan) using OpenLab software (Improvision). The percentage of microinjected cells that exhibited dye coupling was determined as previously described (18Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E. Shao Q. Kidder G.M. Laird D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11458-11466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For the co-immunoprecipitation studies, HeLa cells were transfected with Cx43-mRFP together with Cx32-GFP or Cx43 variants (Cx43-GFP, G21R-GFP, G138R-GFP, or GFP-Cx43). Identical amounts of transfected HeLa cells were incubated in the immunoprecipitation (IP) lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and proteases inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C in the presence of an anti-GFP antibody. Immune complexes were collected by incubating the mixtures with 30 μl (50% suspension) of protein A-Sepharose beads. Nonspecifically bound proteins were removed by washing the beads three times in 500 μl of IP lysis buffer. Bound material was solubilized in 30 μl of 2-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked 30 min with the Odyssey (Li-Cor Biosciences) blocking buffer at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibody (GFP monoclonal antibody (MAB3580, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) or DsRed (mRFP) polyclonal antibody (632496, Clontech, Mountain View, CA)) overnight at 4 °C. Immunoreactive bands were revealed following 1-h incubation with Alexa Fluor 680 (red, Invitrogen) or IRDye 800 conjugated secondary antibodies (green, Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA) and visualized using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Functional gap junction coupling between paired N2A, BICR-M1Rk, and HeLa-Cx32D cells expressing fluorescent protein-tagged mutant and/or wild-type Cx43 and Cx32 was assessed using the dual whole cell patch clamp technique as previously described (18Roscoe W. Veitch G.I. Gong X.Q. Pellegrino E. Bai D. McLachlan E. Shao Q. Kidder G.M. Laird D.W. J. Biol.

N2A cells were chosen due to the facts that: 1) they are GJIC-deficient; 2) they can be easily transfected with different connexin encoding cDNAs; and 3) they are readily amenable to the patch clamp technique. Isolated cell pairs with green fluorescent plaques (representing GFP-tagged Cx) at cell-cell contacts or with both green and red (representing GFP and mRFP-tagged Cx or mutants, respectively) plaques (in dual-color experiments) at the cell-cell interfaces were chosen for patch clamp recording. Gap junctional conductance (Gj) was determined and presented as mean ± S.E. Online series resistance compensation at 80% or off-line series resistance compensation (35Musa H. Fenn E. Crye M. Gemel J. Beyer E.C. Veenstra R.D. J. Physiol. 2004; 557: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) were applied to improve the accuracy of measured Gj. Student's t test was performed with Microsoft Excel. The dose-inhibition curves were fitted with GraphPad Software Prism version 4. To determine if specific Cx43 ODDD-linked mutants exhibit the same potential to impair co-expressed Cx43 function, it was essential to recapitulate an in vitro model that would mimic the human disease where both mutant and endogenous Cx43 are expected to be equally co-expressed. To that end, we established a correlative two-color fluorescent protein tagging and electrophysiological recordings model under conditions where connexin variants were co-expressed within the same cells at different dose ratios. Characterization of Connexin Variants and Establishment of a Correlative Two-color Fluorescence and Electrophysiological Assay—To begin to assess the specificity of connexin variants to act as specific dominant negatives we first characterized the spatial localization of GFP-Cx32 in Cx43-positive BICR-M1Rk cells and GJIC-deficient HeLa cells. GFP-Cx32 formed gap junction plaque-like structures with or without the presence of endogenous Cx43 (Fig. 2, B and D) not unlike GFP-Cx43 (Fig. 2, A and C). To assess if GFP-Cx32 and endogenous Cx43 were co-localized to the same intracellular compartme"
https://openalex.org/W2120367862,"The early stage embryogenesis of higher eukaryotes lacks some of the damage response pathways such as G1/S checkpoint, G2/M checkpoint and apoptosis. We examined here the damage response of preimplantation stage embryos after fertilization with 6 Gy irradiated sperm. Sperm-irradiated embryos developed normally for the first 2.5 days, but started to exhibit a developmental delay at day 3.5. p21 was activated in the delayed embryos, which carried numerous micronuclei owing to delayed chromosome instability. Apoptosis was observed predominantly in the inner cell mass of the day 4.0 embryos. Sperm-irradiated p21−/− embryos lacked the delay, but chromosome instability and apoptosis were more pronounced than the corresponding p21 wild-type embryos. We conclude from the result that damage responses come in a stage-specific manner during preimplantation stage development; p53-dependent S checkpoint at the zygote stage, p21-mediated cell cycle arrest at the morula/blastocyst stages and apoptosis after the blastocyst stage in the inner cell mass."

The key role of M-CSF is demonstrated by the fact that osteopetrotic op/op mice expressing non-functional cytokine are devoid of macrophages and their derivative osteoclasts (3Kodama H. Yamasaki A.

Upon ligand binding, the receptor dimerizes, activates the kinase domain, and autophosphorylates at seven tyrosine residues (6Rohrschneider L.R. Bourette R.P. Lioubin M.N. Algate P.A. Myles G.M.

To identify individual proteins binding to each phosphotyrosine, others have expressed variants of the receptor bearing tyrosine (Tyr) to phenylalanine (Phe) mutations in the cytoplasmic tail in heterologous cell lines. In this circumstance, Tyr-559, Tyr-706, Tyr-721, and Tyr-974 are the respective binding sites for Src family kinase members (SFKs), signal transducer and activator of transcription-1, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Cbl, whereas Tyr-697 and Tyr-921 recognize Grb2 (8Bourette R.P.

These experiments are compromised by the fact that c-Fms mutants were expressed in transformed cell lines, which do not express the RTK endogenously, and are thus of limited relevance regarding the physiology of M-CSF and its receptor. As an example, the effect of mutating Tyr-807 to Phe (Phe-807) on cell proliferation is controversial. This mutation severely impairs cell cycle progression in NIH3T3 and Rat-2 cells (14Roussel M.F.

Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar), providing a conflicting view of the impact of this residue on cell proliferation. Thus, the mechanisms by which M-CSF stimulates proliferation of authentic macrophages remain to be defined. The MAPK cascade involving the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is required for proliferation of macrophages in response to M-CSF (18Jaworowski A. Wilson N.J. Christy E. Byrne R. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15127-15133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, the signals emanating from c-Fms leading to ERK stimulation in primary cells are unclear. Given these two sets of facts, we set out to define the role of the c-Fms/ERK pathway in M-CSF-driven cell cycle progression. Our approach involves retroviral expression, in primary macrophages expressing endogenous c-Fms, of a chimeric receptor comprising the external domain of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail of c-Fms. Treatment with M-CSF or Epo, respectively, activates the endogenous or chimeric receptor. We find that M-CSF-induced DNA replication of primary macrophages requires signals transmitted by three residues in the cytoplasmic tail of c-Fms, the dominant being Tyr-559. Activation of the ERK and Akt pathways by M-CSF is mediated by c-Fms Tyr-559 and Tyr-697, but signals required for macrophage proliferation require the additional presence of Tyr-807. Using specific small molecule inhibitors we find that a combination of the SFK, ERK, and PLC pathways mediates macrophage proliferation in response to M-CSF. Reagents—Antibodies directed against the C-terminal domain of c-Fms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phospho-Tyr-721 and -Tyr-807 of c-Fms, Akt, phospho-Akt, ERKs, and phospho-ERKs (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), FLAG and β-actin (Sigma) were purchased commercially.

To perform biochemical analysis of chimeric receptors, N-terminal FLAG-tagged chimeric EpoR/c-Fms receptors were constructed by adding FLAG coding sequence at the position just after the EpoR signal peptide sequence, using PCR primers (NFLAGF, 5′-ATCCTAGGCTTGTCGTCATCGTCTTTGTAGTCTGCCCAGGCTGCCCCAGC-3′, and a vector primer NFLAGR, 5′-TTGCTAGCCCCAGCCTCCCGGACCCCAAG-3′, and an internal reverse primer). Two PCR fragments were double-digested with BamHI/AvrII or NheI/XhoI, respectively, and ligated into the BamHI and XhoI-digested WT chimera receptor vector. Silent nucleotide substitutions, which do not alter amino acid sequences, were introduced at positions Ala-650, His-701, Val-718, (Glu-743, Ala-744, Ser-745), and (Gly-840, Ile-841) to create new restriction sites for SphI, XbaI, SalI, HindIII, and EcoRI, respectively. Multiple combinations of Tyr to Phe mutations were established using these restriction sites. The expression plasmids were transiently transfected into Plat-E packaging cells (22Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1328) Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences). Virus was collected 48, 72, and 96 h after transfection and pooled. Primary Macrophages and Retrovirus Infection—M-CSF-dependent bone marrow macrophages (MDBMs) were cultured in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% CMG14-12 culture supernatant from bone marrow cells of 6- to 9-week-old mice for 2 days as previously described (23Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Then, cells were infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of 10% CMG14-12 culture supernatant and 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Cells were cultured further in the presence of M-CSF and 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) for 3 days prior to treatment with Epo and Western blot analysis. For proliferation, assay cells were cultured in the presence of either M-CSF or Epo and puromycin for 2 days, and proliferation activity was measured as described below. MDBM Proliferation Assay—Either M-CSF- or Epo-stimulated transduced cells were labeled with 10 μm 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 2 h, and BrdUrd incorporation was measured using a Cell Proliferation Biotrak enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Cycle Analysis—For cell cycle analysis, MDBMs transduced with vector alone, WT, Phe-559, or Phe-807 EpoR/c-Fms were cultured in the presence of serum containing medium supplemented with 10% CMG14-12 culture supernatant and puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 2 days and then maintained further in the presence of low levels of M-CSF and puromycin for an additional 3 days, during which time cells failed to proliferate. Cells were washed with medium without serum three times and restimulated with either M-CSF (100 ng/ml) or Epo (100 ng/ml) in the presence of serum. After 24 h, cells were labeled with 10 μm BrdUrd for 1 h, and their cell cycle was characterized using the BrdUrd/7-amino actinomycin D flow kit (BD Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Transduced cells were starved of serum and cytokines for 6 h and restimulated with Epo for the appropriate time. Cells were lysed in a radioimmune precipitation buffer containing inhibitors as described previously (24Wei S. Wang M.W. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 21: 6622-6630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (172) Google Scholar). 200 μg of cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG (Sigma) and protein A/G PLUS-agarose (Santa Cruz). Cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on 8% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then exposed to primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C, washed three times, and incubated with secondary goat anti-mouse or rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h. Membranes were washed extensively, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection assay was performed following the manufacturer's directions (Pierce). In Vitro Kinase Assay—MDBMs were transduced with retrovirus coding for FLAG-tagged WT EpoR/c-Fms, all seven single Tyr/Phe point mutations, and the kinase-dead form of the receptor. Cells were selected for 2 days in puromycin, treated for 5 min with 20 units/ml Epo, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal (M2; Sigma). Following washing to remove non-specifically bound proteins, excess FLAG peptide (Sigma) was added in 50 μl of washing buffer and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to elute bound FLAG-tagged c-Fms. Equal aliquots were removed, added directly to kinase activity ELISA plates containing covalently bound pan-RTK substrate E4YD (catalog number 539701; Calbiochem), and the assay was performed as described in the manufacturer's instructions. The results from triplicate wells were used to calculate mean and S.D. for each receptor mutant. Endogenous c-Fms and a Chimeric Receptor Stimulate Macrophage Proliferation Equivalently—M-CSF is required for proliferation of macrophages, but the signals by which the cytokine stimulates cell division in authentic target cells are unknown. To address this issue we used MDBMs, which express c-Fms endogenously (10Lotze M.T. Hamilton J.A. Thomson A.W. Lotze M.T. The Cytokine Handbook. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Ltd., London2003: 545-573Google Scholar, 23Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 25Pixley F.J. Stanley E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 628-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We retrovirally transduced these cells with a chimera containing the extracellular domain of the erythropoietin receptor and the transmembrane and intracellular domains of mouse c-Fms (EpoR/c-Fms). To facilitate our studies, we inserted a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) between the signal sequence and the first amino acid of EpoR. The virus also confers puromycin resistance on transduced cells. We first compared the proliferative capacity of activated WT chimeric receptor, whose c-Fms cytoplasmic tail contains all seven Tyr residues known to be phosphorylated to that of endogenous c-Fms (Fig. 1A). Cells were infected with WT virus for 24 h and then cultured for 2 days in the presence of puromycin and increasing doses of either M-CSF or Epo, after which proliferation was determined by incorporation of BrdUrd into replicating DNA for 2 h. Fig. 1B shows that activation of either endogenous c-Fms or the WT chimeric receptor resulted in indistinguishable, dose-dependent rates of proliferation. Neither kinase-dead K614M EpoR/c-Fms nor the chimera in which all seven Tyr residues are mutated to phenylalanine (Phe) (Fig. 1A, 7F) stimulated incorporation of BrdUrd or led to autophosphorylation of c-Fms (data not shown). Thus, both the kinase activity of c-Fms and some combination of Tyr residues are required for MDBM proliferation. In selected studies, cells were transduced with virus containing no EpoR/c-Fms insert and grown for 2 days in puromycin plus M-CSF or Epo. As expected, the only cells that survived were those exposed to M-CSF, which activated endogenous c-Fms (data not shown). To confirm that our results do not reflect aberrant expression levels of the various chimeras, we quantitated endogenous and chimeric receptors using an antibody that recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of c-Fms. In each circumstance expression of c-Fms and EpoR/c-Fms was comparable (Fig. 1C), a finding that also extends to all other chimeric receptors reported in this study (data not shown). c-Fms Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807 Each Contribute to Macrophage Proliferation—Having established that the proliferative capacity of EpoR/c-Fms mirrors that of the endogenous receptor, we determined the ability of each c-Fms cytoplasmic tail Tyr residue to transmit critical mitogenic signals in primary macrophages. Using transformed cells, others find that seven of the twenty Tyr residues in the C-terminal tail of c-Fms bind Src homology 2-containing proteins when phosphorylated, leading to downstream signal amplification (8Bourette R.P. Rohrschneider L.R. Growth Factors. 2000; 17: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Lotze M.T. Hamilton J.A. Thomson A.W. Lotze M.T. The Cytokine Handbook. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Ltd., London2003: 545-573Google Scholar). We therefore asked which c-Fms Tyr residues are critical for proliferation of primary macrophages. To address this question, MDBMs were infected with viruses encoding chimeric receptors, each containing an individual Tyr to Phe mutation. The cells were then cultured in the presence of puromycin and M-CSF. After 2 days of selection, proliferation was again measured by brief BrdUrd incorporation in response to Epo or M-CSF. As seen in Fig. 2, mutating c-Fms Tyr-559 or Tyr-807 to Phe decreased the proliferative capacity of MDBMs by ∼80%. Mutation of Tyr-697 also significantly impaired macrophage proliferation, but the impact of this residue was substantially less than that of Tyr-559 or Tyr-807. All other single mutations were without effect. To confirm these data, we determined cell cycle progression rates of macrophages expressing WT, Phe-559, and Phe-807 EpoR/c-Fms. In this experiment, MDBMs bearing empty vector or the three forms of EpoR/c-Fms were synchronized by culture for 3 days with minimal amounts of M-CSF, stimulated to reenter the cell cycle with M-CSF or Epo, and analyzed by combined BrdUrd and 7-amino actinomycin D labeling of DNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As expected, the percentages of all transductants in S-phase following M-CSF exposure were similar (Fig. 3). Likewise, cells bearing empty vector and exposed to Epo were essentially S-phase negative, indicating that they are unable to transit through G1 phase and into S phase. While S-phase transition of Epo-treated WT EpoR/c-Fms transductants approximated that of the same cells exposed to M-CSF, the process was blunted in cells expressing the Phe-559 or Phe-807 mutations. Thus, these data also reveal that Tyr-559 and Tyr-807 mediate signals that suppress apoptosis.FIGURE 3Tyr-559 and Tyr-807 are critical for cell cycle. MDBMs transduced with chimeric receptors were cultured in the presence of M-CSF plus puromycin for 2 days. Cells were cultured in the presence of minimum low dose of M-CSF (10 ng/ml) and puromycin for an additional 3 days, at which point they were no longer proliferating. Next, cells were cultured in the presence of a maximum dose of either Epo or M-CSF for 24 h, and BrdUrd (final concentration 10 μm) was added to cells for the last hour. Cell cycle was characterized by using the BrdUrd Flow kit, with BrdUrd- and 7-amino actinomycin D stained cells being analyzed by flow cytometry. R1, R2, R3, and R4 represent cells in G0/G1, S, G2/M and apoptotic G0/G1, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) c-Fms Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807 Are Essential for Macrophage Growth—Given that c-Fms Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807 stimulate cell cycle progression, mutation of these same amino acids should also decrease cell number in longer term culture. To test this hypothesis, cells transduced with EpoR/c-Fms bearing Phe-559, Phe-697, or Phe-807 were treated with optimal levels of Epo and counted after 2, 4, and 6 days. To compare the consequences of activating the endogenous or chimeric c-Fms receptors, the same cells were also exposed to an optimal concentration of M-CSF. Macrophages expressing EpoR/c-Fms containing any of the Tyr to Phe mutants remained responsive to M-CSF, as exhibited by similar increases in total viable cells over time (Fig. 4). In contrast, when stimulated with Epo for several days, cell number paralleled the degree to which proliferation is blunted (Fig. 2). c-Fms Tyr-721 and Tyr-921, but Not Tyr-706, Combine with Tyr-559, Tyr-697, or Tyr-807 to Modulate Macrophage Proliferation—In addition to amino acids Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807, c-Fms contains several other Tyr residues implicated in regulating c-Fms signal transduction in transformed cells (8Bourette R.P. Rohrschneider L.R. Growth Factors. 2000; 17: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 10Lotze M.T. Hamilton J.A. Thomson A.W. Lotze M.T. The Cytokine Handbook. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Ltd., London2003: 545-573Google Scholar). Although we found individual mutants of these additional residues failed to impact macrophage proliferation (Fig. 2), the possibility existed that they function in the context of Tyr-559, Tyr-697, or Tyr-807 to regulate macrophage growth. To determine the role of these additional Tyr residues in authentic target cells, we expressed a series of multiple EpoR/c-Fms Tyr to Phe mutants in MDBMs (Fig. 5A) and analyzed their impact on proliferation. ERKs are required for macrophage proliferation (19Valledor A.F. Comalada M. Xaus J. Celada A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7403-7409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Aziz N. Cherwinski H. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1101-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and Grb2 is a key adaptor protein in the RTK stimulation of the ERK pathway (27Tari A.M. Lopez-Berestein G. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 142-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these facts, the double mutant F697/F921 completely blocked Grb2/c-Fms association in immortalized cells (28Mancini A. Niedenthal R. Joos H. Koch A. Trouliaris S. Niemann H. Tamura T. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), suggesting that cells bearing the construct would be minimally responsive to Epo. Although substantially reduced, significant proliferation is still observed in MDBMs expressing the double mutant (Fig. 5B). Thus, the findings reported in immortalized cells regarding the essential role of c-Fms Tyr-697 and Tyr-721 do not reflect accurately the situation in primary macrophages. Tyr-697, Tyr-706, and Tyr-721 reside in the c-Fms kinase insert. Mutation of each to Phe blocks proliferation of Rat-2 fibroblasts (16van der Geer P. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) but slightly enhances the same process in the myeloid-derived cell line FDC-P1 (17Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar), again underscoring the contradictory role of these residues in regulating proliferation in different immortalized and transformed cell types. In contrast to these conflicting results in cell lines, primary macrophages bearing the triple EpoR/c-Fms mutant continued to replicate DNA ∼50% as effectively as WT cells (Fig. 5B). As noted previously (Fig. 2), the proliferative capacity of cells expressing the EpoR/c-Fms single mutants Phe-559 or Phe-807 was reduced by nearly 80% compared with that of endogenous or WT chimera receptors. Moreover, macrophages expressing the Phe mutants of these two Tyr residues in combination were essentially non-proliferative in response to Epo (Fig. 5B), again providing evidence that under physiological stimulation Tyr-559 and Tyr-807 are critical mediators of mitogenic macrophage signaling. Of interest in light of their failure to impact proliferation when expressed individually, Phe-697, Phe-721, or Phe-921 also completely ablated MDBM proliferation in combination with Phe-559. However, Phe-706 did not alter the effect of Phe-559, indicating specificity in the additive effects of Tyr to Phe mutants in combination with Phe-559. Consistent with these findings, triple or quadruple mutants containing combinations of Phe-559, Phe-697, Phe-721, Phe-807, or Phe-921 each failed to stimulate cell proliferation. Taken as a whole, the data in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 indicate that (a) the original hypothesis (10Lotze M.T. Hamilton J.A. Thomson A.W. Lotze M.T. The Cytokine Handbook. 4th Ed. Elsevier Science Ltd., London2003: 545-573Google Scholar) that Tyr-697 and Tyr-721 are the sole transducers of c-Fms signaling is incorrect, (b) Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807 mediate M-CSF-dependent macrophage proliferation, with Tyr-559 the single most important residue, and (c) Tyr-559 and Tyr-807 transmit signals that suppress macrophage apoptosis. The detailed nature of these downstream pathways is beyond the scope of the present study. A Subset of c-Fms Cytoplasmic Tail Tyr Residues Is Sufficient to Transmit Proliferative Signals—The experiments detailed thus far have involved chimeric receptors in which the c-Fms cytoplasmic tail carries one or several Tyr to Phe point mutations, with the remaining Tyr residues unchanged. Although this approach allows us to deduce the consequence of eliminating a given residue, it fails to provide direct evidence of the contribution of individual amino acids to c-Fms function. To address this issue, we used retroviral transduction to systematically add back individual Tyr residues to inactive EpoR/c-Fms (Fig. 6A) in which all seven Tyr residues had been mutated to Phe (Fig. 1A, 7F). In addition to the three critical residues, Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807, we included Tyr-721, as we have established its importance in M-CSF-stimulated preosteoclast cytoskeletal organization (46Faccio R. Takeshita S. Colaianni G. Chappel J. Zallone A. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18991-18999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, Tyr-559 was essential for detectable EpoR/c-Fms-mediated macrophage proliferation. Whereas Tyr-559 was ineffective alone, chimeric receptors containing any combination of Tyr-559 with Tyr-697, Tyr-721, or Tyr-807 promoted limited cell proliferation. Consistent with such additive effects, reconstitution of EpoR/c-Fms 7F with Tyr-559/Tyr-697/Tyr-721 or Tyr-559/Tyr-697/Tyr-807 significantly restored S-phase entry. Notably, the latter combination restored cell cycle progression to levels similar to that of the WT chimeric receptor. Confirming our earlier findings demonstrating dissociation between proliferation and ERK and Akt activation, there was little correlation between the ability of any given Tyr residue add back to induce these signaling molecules, on the one hand, and BrdUrd incorporation on the other (compare, for example, lanes 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 13 in Fig. 6B with lanes 2, 4, 12, 14, 16, 24, or 26 in Fig. 6C). Thus, maximal c-Fms signaling into the cell cycle machinery requires only three of the seven Tyr residues in the cytoplasmic tail of the receptor. Furthermore, activation of the ERK and Akt pathways is not itself sufficient to stimulate completely the proliferative capacity of primary macrophages. c-Fms Tyr-559, Tyr-697, and Tyr-807 Mediate Different Signals—To determine whether distinct intracellular signals emanate from each of the three critical c-Fms Tyr residues, we once again used M-CSF- and Epo-tre"

In contrast, D835R and R840E mutations predicted to disrupt tetrameric interactions only allowed dimerization of MBP. A chromosomal MutS truncation mutation eliminating the dimerization/tetramerization domain eliminated mismatch repair, whereas the tetramer-disrupting MutS D835R and R840E mutations only modestly affected MutS function.

Errors during DNA replication can result in base-base mispairs and small insertion or deletion mispairs that when left unrepaired give rise to mutations during subsequent rounds of replication. The mismatch repair (MMR) 4The abbreviations used are: MMR, mismatch repair; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering; MBP, maltose-binding protein. pathway normally corrects these errors (1.Iyer R.R. Pluciennik A. Burdett V. Modrich P.L. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 302-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and the importance of this pathway is demonstrated by its conservation from bacteria to humans and its role in preventing the development of human cancers (2.Peltomaki P.

In bacteria, mispairs are first recognized by the MutS protein, which is both a mispair-specific DNA-binding protein and an ATPase (4.Haber L.T. Walker G.C.

The MutS-mispair complex then recruits another conserved ATPase, the MutL homodimer (6.Grilley M. Welsh K.M. Su S.S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

In Escherichia coli methyl-directed MMR, MutS and MutL activate the MutH endonuclease, which cleaves hemimethylated GATC sequences in DNA duplexes on the newly synthesized strand lacking methyl groups (8.Au K.G. Welsh K. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12142-12148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nick then targets helicases, nucleases, and DNA polymerases to initiate strand-specific excision and resynthesis to repair the mismatch (9.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Although this repair reaction has been reconstituted in vitro (9.Lahue R.S. Au K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the molecular mechanism that coordinates the initial events of MMR (mispair recognition) with downstream events (nicking, excision, and replacement of the error-containing strand) is not well understood. Accordingly, several models have been proposed that attempt to explain the orchestration of these events (10.Allen D.J. Makhov A. Grilley M. Taylor J. Thresher R. Modrich P. Griffith J.D.

Furthermore, functional complementation of E. coli mutS deletion strains by the mutSΔ800 protein for mutation avoidance requires overexpression from plasmids (20.Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A.

Integration of the mutSΔ800 mutation into the genome demonstrates that this allele results in a substantial MMR defect (21.Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A. Marinus M.G. J.

Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6577-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the MutSΔ800 protein has dimerization defects in addition to tetramerization defects (22.Lamers M.H. Georgijevic D. Lebbink J.H. Winterwerp H.H. Agianian B. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of MutSΔ800 to complement mutS strains only when overexpressed might be due to stabilization of the dimer (20.Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A. Marinus M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 1193-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21.Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6577-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the reported association constant for tetramerization ranges over 2 orders of magnitude, from 2.1 × 10-7 m-1 to 2.2 × 10-6 m-1 for E. coli (15.Bjornson K.P. Blackwell L.J. Sage H.

Ban C. Fleming K.G. Qin J. Lary J.W. Yphantis D.A. Yang W. Hsieh P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23673-23678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This result is at odds with the idea that MutS concentrations are kept close to the concentration at which tetramers form. Despite this, recent experimental data indicate that a point mutation, D835R, which causes defects in tetramerization of a peptide corresponding to the C terminus of MutS, is genetically identical to mutSΔ800 in an overexpression assay, which has suggested a role for tetramerization in vivo (23.Manelyte L. Urbanke C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the present study we have determined that the MutS tetramer is extended by small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and our model explains why MutS does not assemble into complexes larger than tetramers. To gain insight into MutS tetramerization, we fused the C-terminal 53 and 34 residues of E. coli MutS onto maltose-binding protein (MBP) and showed that the fusions cause monomeric MBP to tetramerize. The crystal structure of the tetramerization domain revealed an extensively associated dimer interface, which made weak interactions to form tetramers. The MBP fusions bound MutS and MutS-MutL-DNA complexes, and binding required tetramerization motifs on both MBP and MutS. Deletions of the tetramerization motif predicted to affect both dimerization and tetramerization caused substantial MMR defects when the deletion mutations were integrated into the chromosome. In contrast, MutS tetramer-disrupting point mutations were mostly functional when present at the chromosomal mutS locus. Together, our data resolve the controversies surrounding MutS tetramerization by demonstrating that the dimer-stabilizing role of the MutS C terminus is essential for MMR, but that the tetramer-forming role is not. Plasmid and Strain Construction and General Genetics Methods−A His6-MutSΔ800 expression vector was created by replacing the RsrII-BamHI fragment from pTX412 (24.Feng G. Winkler M.E. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar) (pET15b-His6-MutS; a gift of Malcolm Winkler) with the RsrII-BamHI fragment from MutSΔ800 B5 (gift of Paul Modrich) yielding His6-MutSΔ800 in the pET15b expression vector (pRDK1240). His6-MBP was amplified by PCR from plasmid pMYB5 DNA (New England Biolabs) using a forward primer containing a NcoI restriction site followed by a His6 tag and a reverse primer containing a NdeI restriction site and was ligated into pET15b (Novagen), yielding pRDK1232 (pET15b-His6MBP). The E. coli MutS C-terminal DNA sequence encoding amino acids 801–853 and 820–853 was amplified by PCR with forward primers containing a NdeI restriction site and reverse primers containing a BamHI restriction site and ligated into pRDK1232. This created pRDK1233 and pRDK1234, which fused MutS801–853 and MutS820–853, respectively, to the C terminus of His6MBP. The MBP801-D835R (pRDK1235) and MBP801-R840E (pRDK1236) expression vectors were made as described above, except the mutant mutS was amplified off of the appropriate mutant mutS allele. The strains for in vivo analysis were constructed by PCR-mediated recombination into an E. coli strain conditionally expressing the bacteriophage lambda Red system (21.Calmann M.A. Nowosielska A. Marinus M.G. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 6577-6579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25.Poteete A.R. Fenton A.C. Nadkarni A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, the bla gene (encoding ampicillin resistance) was amplified using a forward oligonucleotide incorporating 50 bases of homology to MutS for integration at the desired location in the E. coli MutS locus followed by a stop codon and a reverse oligonucleotide containing an additional 50 bases of homology immediately downstream of the native MutS codon. PCR products were transformed into strain TP798 (25.Poteete A.R. Fenton A.C. Nadkarni A. BMC Mol. Biol. 2004; 5: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and resulted in ampicillin-resistant strains with a stop codon followed by the bla gene after residues 11 (RDK4782), 800 (RDK4783), 819 (RDK4784), 834 (RDK4785), and 853 (end of wild-type sequence) (RDK4786) of the chromosomal mutS locus. The mutS D835R (RDK4787) and R840E (RDK4788) point mutations were made by amplifying the bla gene from RDK4786 (MutS wild-type bla) genomic DNA using a forward oligo incorporating the desired point mutation and the same reverse oligonucleotide as above and transforming the cassette back into TP798. All chromosomal integrants were verified by PCR and sequencing. Mutation Rate Assay−Mutation rates for rifampicin resistance were determined by fluctuation analysis using at least 15 independent cultures for each strain (26.Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. J. Genet. 1948; 49: 264-285Crossref Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 27.Luria S.F. Delbruck M. Genetics. 1943; 28: 491-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Miller J. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 81-211Google Scholar). Cultures were grown overnight, and dilutions were plated on LB plus 100 μg/ml ampicillin with and without 100 μg/ml rifampicin and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. A two-tailed Mann-Whitney test was performed to calculate p values using Graphpad Prism version 4.0b for Macintosh (Graphpad software). Protein Expression and Purification−His6-MutS and His6-MutL were expressed and purified essentially as described previously (24.Feng G. Winkler M.E. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 956-965PubMed Google Scholar), with the addition of a Mono Q column. His6-MutSD800 was expressed in BL21(DE3)Tn10::mutS (gift of Paul Modrich). The His-tagged MBP proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)Tn10::mutS and purified with a nickel column followed by binding to amylose resin and were eluted with 10 mm maltose. Proteins aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Gel Filtration Chromatography−From 0.25 to 5 mg of the MBP-MutS fusions were loaded onto a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and run in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm EDTA. Both MutS and MutSΔ800 were loaded onto a Superose 6 column (Amersham Biosciences) at a monomeric concentration of 50 μm and run in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. Stokes radii were calculated with a linear regression of retention time versus radius using known standards. Amylose Pull-down Assays−Binding reactions containing 600 pmol of MBP or MBP801 and 600 pmol of MutS or MutSΔ800 were incubated in 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 4 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl on ice for 15 min followed by the addition of 100 μl of amylose resin (New England Biolabs; resuspended in the above buffer) for an additional 15 min. After extensive washes, bound proteins were eluted with 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm maltose, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Experiments analyzing formation of ternary complex with MutL were performed as follows. MBP801 and MutS were incubated and bound to amylose resin, as described above. Samples were then washed with buffer with and without 250 μm ATP as indicated. Next, 300 pmol of MutL and/or 150 pmol of mispair containing DNA (71 bp) in buffer with and without 250 μm ATP were added and incubated for 15 additional minutes on ice as indicated. Samples were washed with buffer with and without 250 μm ATP and eluted and processed above. SAXS Data Collection and Processing−SAXS data were collected at beamline 12.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories. A wavelength of 1.115869 Å was used with a sample to a detector distance of 1.48 meters. The resolution scale was calibrated using a silver behenate calibration standard that had diffraction maxima at 0.107633 and 0.215266 Å-1. Buffer and samples were collected alternately with short exposures bracketing a longer exposure. The short exposures were compared to ensure that no radiation damage occurred, and data from all exposures were merged using PRIMUS. For each sample, data were collected at several different protein concentrations, and the scattering was fit by the indirect Fourier transform method (29.Moore P.B. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1980; 13: 168-175Crossref Google Scholar) as implemented in GNOM (30.Semenyuk A.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 537-540Crossref Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Theoretical scattering from atomic models was compared with experimental data using the program CRYSOL (31.Svergun D.I. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2790) Google Scholar). Crystallization and Structure Determination−MBP820 was crystallized by the hanging drop method against a reservoir of 15% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.6), and 100 mm lithium acetate. X-ray diffraction data were collected at beamline 11-1 at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at a wavelength of 0.9795 Å. Data were integrated and merged with DENZO and SCALEPACK (32.Otwinowski Z. Sawyer L. Isaacs N. Bailey S. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend. Science and Engineering Research Council, Warrington, UK1993: 56-62Google Scholar). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using AMoRe in the CCP4 package (33.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19795) Google Scholar). Manual model building was performed via XtalView (34.McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar) and initially refined with CNS 1.1 (35.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S.

Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) using 11 optimal TLS groups as defined by TLSMD (38.Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Full-length MutS Is Tetrameric, whereas MutSΔ800 Is Substantially Monomeric−To establish that preparations of wild-type MutS were tetrameric, both MutS and the MutSΔ800 proteins were analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2A). Similar to previous observations, the Stokes radius (RS) of the wild-type tetrameric MutS, 83.3 Å, was larger than would be predicted for a globular MutS tetramer, which has an expected RS of 59.0 Å and a Mr of 358 kDa (39.Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). By contrast, the MutSΔ800 truncation (monomeric molecular mass of 89.5 kDa) eluted with an RS of 42.5 Å, similar to a 113-kDa globular protein, which was much smaller than the RS of 49 Å and Mr of 179 kDa expected for a globular MutS dimer. Dimerization defects in the MutSΔ800 have been previously observed (22.Lamers M.H. Georgijevic D. Lebbink J.H. Winterwerp H.H. Agianian B. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43879-43885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23.Manelyte L. Urbanke C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein also discriminated between fully base-paired DNAs and those containing single mispairs and formed MutS-MutL-DNA-ATP complexes as demonstrated in total internal reflectance and surface plasmon resonance experiments, whereas MutSΔ800 had substantial defects even in binding to mispair-containing DNA (data not shown), consistent with previous data (15.Bjornson K.P. Blackwell L.J. Sage H. Baitinger C. Allen D. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34667-34673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). SAXS data collected on wild-type MutS and MutSΔ800 agreed with the size-exclusion chromatography data (Fig. 2B). The radius of gyration (Rg), which is an x-ray analog of RS, was 38.3 Å for MutSΔ800 and 80.8 Å for MutS. Unlike RS and Rg, the scattering intensity at zero angle, I(0), is independent of shape and can be used to determine stoichiometry of oligomers. I(0) depends linearly upon protein concentration (Fig. 2C, inset) and depends on the square of the molecular weight of the scattered particle (40.Doniach S. Chem. Rev. 2001; 101: 1763-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In protein solutions with equal molar concentrations of monomers, multimerization increases the molecular weight and decreases the concentration of scattering particles by the same integral factor. Thus the ratio of I(0) of the multimer to the I(0) of the monomer gives the stoichiometry of the complex. The ratio between wild-type MutS, which is known to form tetramers, and MutSΔ800 was 4.0 ± 0.5 (Fig. 2C), indicating a tetrameric assembly for wild-type MutS and a monomeric assembly for MutSΔ800 under our conditions. The MutS Tetramer Is Extended−To understand the structure of the MutS tetramer in solution, we calculated the Fourier transforms of the SAXS curves to generate the pair-distribution function, P(R) (Fig. 2D). The P(R) is a histogram of distances between electrons in the scattering particle and can be directly compared with P(R) functions calculated from atomic models (Fig. 2E). Potential MutS tetramers constructed with face-to-face or side-to-side contacts of the MutS rings were not consistent with the experimental P(R) function with a Dmax of ∼250 Å. Instead, only elongated tetramers with contacts either at the ATPase domains (head-to-head tetramers) or the DNA clamping domains (tail-to-tail tetramers) were consistent with the experimental P(R) function. These elongated structures were consistent with the fact that wild-type MutS tetramers had a larger RS than would be predicted by the molecular weight of the tetramer (39.Bjornson K.P. Allen D.J. Modrich P. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3176-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2A). Among the potential extended MutS tetramers, the C termini required for tetramerization were brought together only in the head-to-head tetramer and suggested this arrangement over the tail-to-tail or head-to-tail tetramers. This head-to-head tetramer is consistent with the observation that oligomers larger than tetramers were not observed in analytical ultracentrifugation experiments (15.Bjornson K.P. Blackwell L.J. Sage H. Baitinger C. Allen D. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34667-34673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 22.Lamers M.H. Georgijevic D. Lebbink J.H. Winterwerp H.H. Agianian B. de Wind N. Sixma T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43879-43885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to potential multimers formed by head-to-tail, face-to-face, or side-to-side arrangements of MutS rings, a head-to-head tetramer sterically occludes the C-terminal domain mediating the tetramerization and would block the formation of higher order oligomers. Addition of the MutS C Terminus Causes MBP to Tetramerize−The C-terminal 53 amino acid domain could tetramerize MutS by two distinct mechanisms. In the first, the domain might only form a dimer and cause MutS to tetramerize by pairing with a symmetry-related partner from another MutS dimer through an alternative dimer interaction. In the second, the domain itself might tetramerize, thereby bringing together two MutS dimers. To distinguish these possibilities, we fused the last 53 amino acids of E. coli MutS (residues 801–853, Fig. 1) to the MBP C terminus to generate MBP801. The purified MBP801 protein eluted earlier in size-exclusion chromatography (RS of 52.6 Å) than monomeric MBP (RS of 15.7 Å; Fig. 3A). The elution time matched the expected elution time for a MBP tetramer; however, elongated molecules have a larger RS than would be predicted by molecular weight alone so this does not constitute strong proof of tetramer formation. The 53 amino acids in the C-terminal motif can be divided into a non-conserved N-terminal region not predicted to form secondary structure and a C-terminal region predicted to form two amphipathic helices (Fig. 1). A second MBP fusion, MBP820, was generated that contained the region of the C-terminal motif predicted to form secondary structure (residues 820–853). The expressed protein chromatographed almost identically to MBP801 with an RS of 46.8 Å (Fig. 3A), which indicated that the last 34 residues are sufficient to increase the RS of the MBP fusion. SAXS data were collected for MBP801, MBP820, and MBP to understand conformation and stoichiometry of the MBP constructs (Fig. 3B). The Rg was 58.1, 45.7, and 22.1 Å for MBP801, MBP820, and monomeric MBP, respectively. This was consistent with both the RS and oligomerization observed by size-exclusion chromatography. MBP exists in an “open” unbound state and a “closed” maltose-bound state (41.Shilton B.H. Flocco M.M. Nilsson M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Comparison of calculated scattering from crystal structures of known MBP conformations indicated that the MBP monomer was closed (Fig. 3C), similar to previous SAXS results (41.Shilton B.H. Flocco M.M. Nilsson M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 350-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, ab initio structure generation from the SAXS data using GASBOR (42.Svergun D.I. Petoukhov M.V. Koch M.H. Biophys J. 2001; 80: 2946-2953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar) fits the known crystal structure of the closed form of MBP. Stoichiometric measurement by I(0) ratios at equivalent monomer concentrations indicated that MBP801 and MBP820 were tetramers (Fig. 3D), consistent with analytical ultracentrifugation analysis of the isolated MutS peptide comprising residues 801–853 (23.Manelyte L. Urbanke C. Giron-Monzon L. Friedhoff P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5270-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data show that the C-terminal motif directly mediates tetramerization, which is consistent with the head-to-head extended MutS tetramer solution assembly predicted by the SAXS analysis. Unlike monomeric MBP, the P(R) function of MBP801 and MBP820 had two peaks, suggesting that the average distances between the centers of the MBP domains in the MBP801 and MBP820 tetramers were 78 and 62 Å, respectively (Fig. 3E). The larger distances observed with MBP801 were consistent with longer linker distances. MBP801 Can Interact with MutS and MutS-MutL-DNA Complexes−The MBP801 fusion retained the ability of wild-type MBP to bind with high affinity to starch matrices and could be eluted from such matrices with maltose (Fig. 4A). Thus, we sought to determine whether the MBP fusions could specifically bind MutS. MBP801 was bound to a starch matrix, and MutS or MutSΔ800 was added. After washing, the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm maltose and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Full-length MutS copurified with MBP801 in the maltose elution but was not eluted from the starch column by maltose in the absence of MBP801. Similarly, MutSΔ800 did not co-purify with MBP801 nor did full-length MutS co-purify with wild-type MBP. Thus, the formation of heterotetramers between MutS and MBP801 was dependent upon the presence of the tetramerization motif. Because MutS could be immobilized on a starch matrix through interaction with MBP801, we addressed the question of whether or not this interaction would be disrupted by the formation of a ternary complex containing MutS, MutL, and mispaired DNA (Fig. 4B). MutS, MutL, ATP, and mispaired DNA were added to a starch matrix containing prebound MBP801. In the presence of maltose, MutS and MutL co-eluted with MBP801, indicating that ternary complexes can form a complex with MBP801. The binding of MutL to M"

However, the significance of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in endocytosis is unknown. We found that overexpression of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation decreased transferrin uptake. Suppression of cortactin expression by RNA interference also reduced transferrin internalization. Such inhibition was effectively rescued by overexpressing wild-type cortactin but not a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation or a mutant with deletion of the Src homology 3 domain. Likewise, purified phosphorylation-null cortactin failed to restore the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles in a cortactin-depleted cell extract. In vitro analysis revealed that Src-mediated phosphorylation enhanced the association of cortactin with dynamin-2 in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Quantitative analysis demonstrated that Src enhances the affinity of cortactin for dynamin-2 by more than 3-fold. On the other hand, Src-treated dynamin-2 had no effect on its interaction with cortactin. These data indicate that Src kinase is implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by phosphorylation of cortactin.

These data indicate that Src kinase is implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by phosphorylation of cortactin. Receptor-mediated endocytosis constitutes an important cellular mechanism to take nutrients into cells and transduce extracellular signals essential for cell homeostasis, proliferation, and differentiation. The best characterized internalization process so far is clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which involves concentration of membrane-associated receptors that are either unoccupied (for constitutive pathway) or occupied by their ligands (for the ligand dependent pathway) in a cage-like structure that is composed primarily of clathrin (1.Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, assembly of clathrin-coated pits requires other coat constituents, including monomeric assembly protein (AP-180) and heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP-2), the latter of which links the clathrin cage to the cytoplasmic domains of endocytic receptors. Invagination or scission of clathrin-coated pits into the cytosol of many types of cells also requires the function of dynamin-2, a ubiquitously expressed member of the large GTPase family that is associated with the narrow neck of clathrin-coated pits (2.McNiven M.A. Cao H. Pitts K.R. Yoon Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 115-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).

The mechanism of phosphorylation-regulated endocytosis appears to be complicated, as phosphorylation either facilitates or hampers clathrin-mediated endocytosis. For example, kinase CK2-mediated phosphorylation of AP-2 subunits α- and β2-adaptin reduces the interaction of AP-2 with clathrin (4.Wilde A. Brodsky F.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 635-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 5.Georgieva-Hanson V. Schook W.J. Puszkin S. J. Neurochem. 1988; 50: 307-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), a process that is essential for the assembly of clathrin-coated vesicles. Similarly, phosphorylation of dynamin-1 and synaptojanin-1 has been reported to inhibit their binding to amphiphysin, whereas phosphorylation of amphiphysin inhibits its binding to AP-2 and clathrin (6.Slepnev V.I. Ochoa G.C. Butler M.H. Grabs D. De Camilli P. Science. 1998; 281: 821-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). On the other hand, exposure of cells to protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitors profoundly attenuates ligand-induced internalization of receptors for EGF, B-cell antigen, and asialoglycoprotein and partially inhibits ligand-independent or constitutive endocytosis of the transferrin (Tfn) receptor (7.Lamaze C.

Although the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity associated with receptors for polypeptide growth factors such as EGF and insulin is known to be important for their endocytosis upon occupancy by ligands (1.Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3101) Google Scholar), selective inhibition of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase Src also attenuates the internalization of c-Kit in hematopoietic cells (10.Broudy V.C.

Despite the compelling evidence for the role of tyrosine phosphorylation in endocytosis, the mechanism by which Src regulates endocytosis is largely unknown. Cortactin, which contains a C-terminal SH3 domain and six and one-half 37-amino acid repeats, is an Arp2/3 complex and filamentous actin (F-actin)-binding protein (15.Wu H. Parsons J.T. J.

Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Immunostaining with endosome markers or internalized ligands such as Tfn has established that many of these puncta represent endocytic vesicles (20.Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) considerably impairs Tfn uptake in cells. Our recent in vitro analysis of Tfn sequestration using perforated cells demonstrates that depletion of cortactin in cytosol extracts weakens the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating that cortactin is important for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Conversely, depletion of cortactin in cells or overexpression of a cortactin SH3 fragment also reduces clathrin-independent endocytosis of γc cytokine receptor (23.Sauvonnet N. Dujeancourt A. Dautry-Varsat A. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), indicating that cortactin may play a broad role in protein internalization. The mechanism for cortactin-mediated endocytosis likely involves actin cytoskeleton reorganization as cortactin is known to promote the actin polymerization mediated by Arp2/3 complex (17.Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 18.Weaver A.M. Karginov A.V. Kinley A.W. Weed S.A. Li Y. Parsons J.T. Cooper J.A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 370-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), which yields a cortical actin meshwork enriched at the leading edge of the cell as well as that associated with endocytic vesicles. In the de novo actin assembly, the major force pushing membrane protrusion, cortactin binds tightly to Arp2/3 complex at a nascent actin branching site, thereby generating a possible inward dynamic movement for an organelle that attaches to cortactin through its SH3 domain during the process of actin assembly (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Indeed, a major cortactin SH3-binding protein has been found to be dynamin-2 (24.McNiven M.A. Kim L. Krueger E.W. Orth J.D. Cao H. Wong T.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 187-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Importantly, binding of cortactin to dynamin-2 is dependent upon actin polymerization itself, because it associates with dynamin-2 maximally only during the process of actin assembly (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, coordination and dynamic interaction between cortactin and dynamin-2 may provide a mechanical force responsible for an actin assembly-driven movement of endocytic vesicles to the deep cytosol, which eventually leads to detachment of vesicles from a protrusive membrane. Consistent with this notion, a recent analysis using alternating evanescent field and epifluorescence illumination has shown that maximal invagination and scission of clathrin-coated pits coincides with recruitment of cortactin to the endocytic site (25.Merrifield C.J. Perrais D. Zenisek D. Cell. 2005; 121: 593-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Cortactin is also known to be a prominent substrate of Src protein-tyrosine kinase (19.Liu J. Huang C. Zhan X. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6700-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26.Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs frequently in response to various extracellular stimuli including growth factors (16.Zhan X.

Although previous studies have found that introduction of a cortactin mutant deficient in tyrosine phosphorylation impairs cell motility, tumor invasion, invadopodia, and podosome formation (30.Li Y.

Therefore, the physiological role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation remains unknown. In this study we investigated a possible role of Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in receptor-mediated endocytosis. We found that deficiency in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin attenuates Tfn uptake. Furthermore, we found that Src promotes the interaction between cortactin and dynamin-2. These findings indicate a role of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in the regulation of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Antibodies and Reagents−Monoclonal cortactin antibody (4F11) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.; polyclonal cortactin antibody was prepared as described previously (16.Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); human Tfn antibody was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc; antibiotin antibody and NHS-SS-biotin were from Pierce; GFP antibody was either purchased from Molecular Probes or raised against recombinant His-GFP protein; anti-Myc antibody (9E10) was from BD Biosciences; polyclonal dynamin antibody was either obtained as a gift of Dr. McNiven (Mayo Clinic) or raised against the peptide CARDVLENKLLPLRRGYIGVVNRSQKD; and polyclonal antibody specific for phosphorylated cortactin was raised against a mixture of two phosphotyrosine (pY)-containing peptides: PSSPVpYEDAASFKC and pYESAEAPGHYPAEDSTpYDEYEC. DNA Constructs and Recombinant Proteins−Plasmid encoding GFP-tagged full-length dynamin-2 (Dyn-GFP) was a gift of Dr. McNiven. Plasmids encoding Myc-cortactin and Myc-Cort-F have been previously described (35.Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). His-tagged and tag-free cortactin proteins were prepared as described previously (17.Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 36.Huang C. Ni Y. Wang T. Gao Y. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol.

To prepare GST-tagged dynamin-2 (GST-dynamin-2) and the proline-rich domain of dynamin-2 (GST-dynamin-2-PRD), DNA fragments were generated by PCR using GFP-dynamin-2 as the template and subcloned into pGEX-4T-2 plasmid. The resulting plasmids were transformed into bacterial BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL (Stratagene) cells for protein expression. The primers used in PCR were as follows: 5′-GTTCTTGAATTCCCATGGGCAACCGCGGGATGGA-3′ and 5′-ATTATTGCGGCCGCCTAGTCGAGCAGGGACGGCTC-3′ for full-length dynamin-2; and 5′-TTACCGGTCGCCACCATGGTGAGC and 5′-TATGCGGCCGCCTAGTCGAGCAGGGACGGCTCGG-3′ for PRD of dynamin-2. Cell Culture, DNA Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation−HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. 3T3-L1 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% calf serum. To analyze the effect of pervanadate (PV) on the interaction between cortactin and dynamin, HEK-293 cells were transiently co-transfected with Dyn-GFP and Myc-cortactin, or Myc-Cort-F. After 24 h, cells were incubated in a serum-free medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were then treated with PV (100 μm Na3VO4 and 4 mm H2O2) for 30 min and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm sodium molybdate, 0.5% Triton X-100, and Roche protease inhibitor mixture tablets). The lysates were then subjected to immunoprecipitation using the appropriate antibodies as indicated in Figs. 4 and 5. The methods for immunoprecipitation and immunoblot have been described previously (37.Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).FIGURE 5Tyrosine phosphorylation of dynamin-2 does not contribute to its interaction with cortactin. A, HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either GFP-dynamin-2 or cortactin-GFP. After 24 h of serum starvation, cells were exposed to PV for 10 min. The cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with GFP antibody and subsequently immunoblotted (IB) with phosphotyrosine (pY) antibody. The same membrane used in the immunoblot was stripped and reblotted with GFP antibody. A weak band in lane 2 (upper panel) with a gel motility similar to cortactin-GFP was an unknown phosphotyrosyl protein by reason of nonspecific activity of the GFP antibody. B, recombinant GST-dynamin-2 was treated with Src kinase at 30 °C for 30 min. Protein phosphorylation was examined by phosphotyrosine immunoblot (upper panel). The amount of proteins used in the kinase reaction was verified by Coomassie staining on a parallel gel (lower panel). C, Src-treated GST-dynamin-2 (12 pmol) was incubated with 5 μg of His-cortactin and pulled down (PD) with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The pellets were analyzed by immunoblotting using polyclonal dynamin-2 antibody (top). The input of His-cortactin used in the pulldown was verified by Coomassie staining (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Analysis of the Effect of Tyrosine Phosphorylation on the Affinity of Cortactin for Dynamin-2−Cortactin was phosphorylated by Src kinase (Upstate) in a reaction buffer containing 100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 125 mm MgCl2, 25 mm MnCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4 at 30 °C for 30 min, the modified condition recommended by the manufacture. To analyze the affinity of cortactin for dynamin, 18 pmol of cortactin, either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated, was incubated with different amounts of GST-dynamin-2 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). After incubation of the mixture for 2 h, samples were centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 s, and aliquots of the supernatants were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot using cortactin antibody. Cortactin on the blot was detected by Kodak Image Station 2000R and quantified as the percentage of depletion. The resulting data were used to fit a rectangular hyperbola using Sigma Plots 8.0, yielding values of the equilibrium dissociation constants (Kd). Capture Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay−Cells expressing cortactin-GFP or Cort-F-GFP were incubated in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 20 mm HEPES at 37 °C for 30 min and incubated with 10 μg/ml bio-Tfn for 30 min on ice. Endocytosis was initiated by incubating the mixture at 37 °C for 5 min and terminated by placing on ice. To measure internalization of bio-Tfn, total cell lysates were added to a 96-well ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) plate coated with an anti-Tfn antibody. After 12 h of incubation at 4 °C, each well was added with streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and Roche BM blue substrate, respectively. Absorption at 450 nm was determined by a microplate reader (Anthos Labtec) and was plotted as a function of time. Cell-free Assay for CCV Formation−The cell-free internalization assay with perforated 3T3-L1 cells was performed according to the method as described (38.Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 cells were subjected to permeabilization by submersion in liquid nitrogen and rapid thawing at 37 °C. The cells were then scraped from culture dishes, washed in KSHM buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 85 mm sucrose, 1 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4), and centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min. The permeabilized cells were then incubated with 8 μg/ml B-SS-Tfn in KSHM buffer containing 0.8% bovine serum albumin for 20 min at 4 °C. The cell suspension (10 μl) was mixed with 300 μg of brain cytosol and an ATP-generating system in a final volume of 40 μl. Biotin-SS-Tfn internalization was initiated by incubating the cells at 37 °C for 20 min and stopped by returning them to ice. After incubation the reaction was washed with 500 μl of ice-cold KSHM buffer and spun at 10,000 × g. Cell pellet was then subjected to MesNa resistance assay as described previously (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). RNA Interference Assay−Human cortactin small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were prepared by an in vitro transcription procedure using T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacture’s protocol of Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). The target sequence is 5′-AAGUUUGGUGUCCAGAUGGAC-3′. The control siRNA against human HS1 targets 5′-GACAUCCUCAAGAAGAAGGAG-3′. Treatment of cells with siRNAs was described previously (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We previously identified residues Tyr-421, Tyr-466, and Tyr-482 of cortactin as the primary sites targeted by Src (35.Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To study the role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in receptor-mediated endocytosis, HeLa cells were infected with a retroviral vector, MGIN (39.Cheng L. Du C. Murray D. Tong X. Zhang Y.A. Chen B.P. Hawley R.G. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), encoding a murine cortactin construct tagged by GFP at the C terminus (cortactin-GFP), a mutant of Y421F/Y466F/Y482F (Cort-F-GFP), and a mutation with deletion of the SH3 domain (CortΔSH3-GFP) (Fig. 1A). The expression level of cortactin GFP fusions in infected cell populations was comparable with that of endogenous cortactin as determined by immunoblot (Fig. 1B). The infected cells were exposed to biotin-Tfn on ice, and internalization of biotin-Tfn was analyzed at 5 min after shifting to 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cells expressing cortactin-GFP internalized Tfn at an efficiency similar to the cells infected with the viral GFP vector, indicating no significant effect of overexpression of wild-type cortactin on endocytosis. However, Tfn uptake in the cells expressing Cort-F-GFP was nearly 40% less than in cells expressing the vector alone (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1C). Similarly, cells overexpressing CortΔSH3-GFP showed an impaired Tfn uptake at an efficiency 43% less than the control cells. To examine the role of Src activity in Tfn uptake, cells were also treated with PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src (40.Amoui M. Draber P. Draberova L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1881-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), prior to Tfn uptake analysis. PP2 treatment inhibited Tfn uptake by ∼60% (p < 0.005), an extent similar to a previous report using genistein, a pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (7.Lamaze C. Baba T. Redelmeier T.E. Schmid S.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, PP2 treatment of cells expressing Cort-F-GFP resulted in only 30% inhibition of Tfn uptake (p = 0.3). The role of cortactin phosphorylation was further analyzed with a cell-free system in which Tfn linked with biotin through a cleavable disulfide bond (B-SS-Tfn) was applied to perforated 3T3-L1 cells (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, sequestration of Tfn into deeply invaginated coated pits and internalization of coated vesicles are able to be reconstituted by incubation with exogenous cytosol (38.Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 41.Schmid S.L. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 869-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 42.Hill E. van der Kaay J. Downes C.P. Smythe E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 309-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 43.Smythe E. Carter L.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1163-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). B-SS-Tfn internalized into coated pits becomes resistant to MesNa-mediated cleavage of B-SS-Tfn, a property that can be used indirectly to measure the CCV formation. To analyze the activity of cortactin and its variants to rescue CCV formation in the absence of cortactin, rat brain extract devoid of cortactin was prepared by absorption using cortactin antibody-conjugated beads followed by precipitation, a process that effectively removed most of the cortactin but not the dynamin-2 or actin in the extract (Fig. 1D). The cortactin-depleted brain extract was then used to reconstitute Tfn endocytosis in perforated 3T3-L1 cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, cortactin-depleted extract (del-Cort) showed impaired CCV formation (60% less than the mock-treated extract), a result that is similar to what we had reported previously (22.Zhu J. Zhou K. Hao J.J. Liu J. Smith N. Zhan X. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 807-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The addition of recombinant wild-type cortactin considerably restored the CCV formation by nearly 80%. In contrast, adding recombinant Cort-F rescued less than 50% of the CCV formation, which is statistically lower than that of wild-type cortactin (p < 0.01), indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is required for a maximal assembly of coated vesicles, an essential step in the early stage of endocytosis. To further establish the role of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in endocytosis within cells, expression of endogenous cortactin of human breast tumor cells (MDA-MB-231) infected by retroviruses carrying different types of murine cortactin mutants was silenced by siRNA targeting of human cortactin mRNA. As a control, virus-infected MDA-MB-231 cells were also treated with siRNA against HS1, a cortactin-related gene that is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the human cortactin siRNA inhibited cortactin expression by ∼60–80% as compared with that of the cells treated with the HS1 siRNA. When biotin-Tfn uptake was analyzed, a nearly 70% reduction in endocytosis was found in the cells treated with cortactin siRNA (Fig. 2B, left), which is consistent with our previous report (22.Zhu J.

We find, unexpectedly, that tyrosine (Tyr) to phenylalanine (Phe) mutation of Tyr-721, the PI3K binding site in the M-CSF receptor c-Fms, fails to suppress cytoskeletal remodeling or actin ring formation. In contrast, mutation of c-Fms Tyr-559 to Phe blocks M-CSF-induced cytoskeletal reorganization by inhibiting formation of a Src Family Kinase SFK·c-Cbl·PI3K complex and the downstream activation of Vav3 and Rac, two key mediators of actin remodeling. Using an add-back approach in which specific Tyr residues are reinserted into c-Fms inactivated by the absence of all seven functionally important Tyr residues, we find that Tyr-559 is necessary but not sufficient to transduce M-CSF-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization. Furthermore, this same add-back approach identifies important roles for Tyr-697 and Tyr-721 in collaborating with Tyr-559 to recruit a multimeric signaling complex that can transduce signals from c-Fms to the actin cytoskeleton.

Cell motility is a dynamic process consisting of repeated cycles of protrusion of filopodia and lamellipodia at the leading front, adhesion of the protruding edge to the substratum via focal complexes, contraction of cytoplasmic actomyosin, and finally release from contact sites at the tail of the cell (1Lauffenburger D.A.

In migrating macrophages and OCs, podosomes are confined to the periphery of the cell, where their reorganization results in lamellipodia formation, a process dependent on de novo actin assembly by the Arp2/3-Ena·Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein complex (8Nakagawa H.

Macrophages and OCs both respond to chemotactic stimuli initiated by M-CSF. Re-addition of M-CSF to quiescent BAC1.2F5 macrophages stimulates rapid cytoskeletal reorganization and cell motility within a few minutes, followed by chemotactic migration up a gradient of diffusing cytokine (15Boocock C.A.

Exposure to the cytokine also increases cell spreading, membrane ruffling, and motility of osteoclasts (12Faccio R. Novack D.V. Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J.

M-CSF binds to its transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Fms and induces receptor autophosphorylation at seven tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain (17Pixley F.J. Stanley E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 628-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Several Src homology 2 domain-containing molecules are recruited to the phospho-Tyr residues upon M-CSF binding and initiate different signaling cascades that lead to cell proliferation, differentiation, or cytoskeletal reorganization (17Pixley F.J. Stanley E.R. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 628-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The identity of the molecules binding the cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms has been determined by expressing wild-type (WT) and tyrosine (Tyr) to phenylalanine (Phe) mutated forms of the RTK in various cell lines. The resulting model suggests that c-Fms Tyr-559 and Tyr-721 bind Src Family Kinases (SFKs) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), respectively, whereas Tyr-697 recognizes Grb2 and Tyr-974 is a binding site for c-Cbl (18Lotze M.T.

Although the detailed signaling cascade activated by M-CSF is not yet fully understood, PI3K and SFKs are recruited to c-Fms and regulate migration of macrophages and OCs. Migration of PI3Kγ- or PI3Kα-null macrophages is impaired in response to the cytokine (21Jones G.E. Prigmore E. Calvez R. Hogan C. Dunn G.A. Hirsch E. Wymann M.P. Ridley A.J. Exp.

Similarly, wortmannin, a potent PI3K inhibitor, inhibits OC migration toward M-CSF and blocks bone resorption in vitro and in vivo (23Pilkington M.F. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Moreover, c-Src null OCs exposed to M-CSF exhibit impaired migration and a failure of cytoskeletal reorganization (25Insogna K.L. Sahni M. Grey A.B. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Neff L. Mitnick M. Levy J.B. Baron R. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2476-2485Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), events that contribute to their deficit in bone-resorbing activity (26Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Finally, the M1 myeloid cell line, which cannot differentiate into mature osteoclasts, displays defective M-CSF-dependent differentiation into more mature macrophages when overexpressing a specific c-Fms tyrosine mutant (Phe-559) that lacks the ability to recruit Src family members, highlighting the importance of c-Fms Tyr-559 and Src family-dependent signaling (27Rohde C.M. Schrum J. Lee A.W.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43448-43461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study is to dissect the signaling pathway initiated by M-CSF that regulates the cytoskeletal rearrangement in primary macrophages and OCs, each of which expresses abundant c-Fms. To achieve this goal we transduced these cells with a chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular domain of erythropoietin (Epo) receptor (EpoR) and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of c-Fms, in which the functionally critical tyrosine residues were either unchanged or mutated to Phe, singly or in combination. We have validated this model previously in that Epo plus RANKL treatment of transduced cells expressing the WT chimera differentiate into bone-resorbing OCs as efficiently as those exposed to RANKL and M-CSF (28Feng X. Takeshita S. Namba N. Wei S. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We show here that binding of M-CSF to c-Fms initiates a series of phosphorylation events resulting in formation of a multimeric complex required for cell motility and cytoskeletal reorganization. The complex contains SFKs·c-Cbl·PI3K, and its optimal assembly following activation of the c-Fms pathway requires the simultaneous presence of three specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the RTK. Infection, Selection, and Expansion of Bone Marrow Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated from long bones of C57/Bl6 mice and cultured for 2 days in α-minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 1:10 volume of CMG14-12 culture supernatant (CMG), equivalent to 100 ng/ml recombinant M-CSF (29Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1477-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). c-Cbl-/- and c-Cbl+/+ BMMs were isolated from long bones of 6/8 week-old-mice kindly provided by Dr. Roland Baron (Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT). BMMs were infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of 1:10 volume of CMG and 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma) as described previously (30Faccio R. Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 749-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and further cultured in the presence of 2 μg/ml puromycin and M-CSF for selection and expansion of transduced cells. Generation and Use of OCs and BMMs—Retrovirally transduced BMMs were cultured on coverslips in α-minimal essential medium + 10% serum supplemented with 1:100 CMG alone or in the presence of 100 ng/ml RANKL for 3 days to generate pre-OCs or for 7 days to generate mature OCs. Western Analysis—BMMs transduced with various EpoR/c-Fms chimeras or control empty vector were starved and stimulated with Epo (20 units/ml) or M-CSF (100 ng/ml). Following stimulation, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors and sodium orthovanadate. Immunoprecipitation was performed using 200-μg protein aliquots incubated for 1 h on ice with 2 μg of primary Ab, followed by overnight incubation with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Total cell lysate Western blot analysis was performed on 40-μg protein aliquots. In brief, electrophoresis in 8% SDS-PAGE was followed by transfer to nitrocellulose, with blocking using 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were exposed overnight at 4 °C to primary antibodies, washed, and incubated with secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody for 1 h and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence detection assay by x-rays (Pierce Chemical Co.). Films were scanned with an Epson Perfection 2400 Photo scanner and figures made in Adobe Photoshop. Some Western blots were performed using secondary antibodies labeled with IR dyes that are visualized by differential fluorescence channels (700 and 800 nm) and scanned using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Li-cor). The polyclonal antibodies used were c-Fms (C-terminal, C-20), c-Cbl, and PI3K-p85 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Vav3 phosphorylation was performed by immunoprecipitation with Vav3 monoclonal Ab (gift from Dr. W. Swat, Washington University, St. Louis, MO) followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Waltham, MA). Immunofluorescence—Mature OCs expressing various EpoR/c-Fms chimeras were generated in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF prior to stimulation with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) or Epo (20 units/ml). Cells were selected with puromycin during the entire culture period. For immunofluorescence, fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin was layered on OCs, fixed and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated in a humidified chamber for 45 min at 37 °C. After rinsing in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.6, coverslips were mounted in 20% Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp.) and viewed on a Nikon microscope (Eclipse E400). Images were acquired using an Optronics camera with Magnafire Software. Spreading and Migration Assays—Cell spreading and chemotactic migration assays were performed using pre-OCs expressing the different EpoR/c-Fms chimeras. For both sets of experiments, BMMs were transduced with the indicated chimeras, selected in puromycin- and 10% CMG-containing media, and then cultured with RANKL and M-CSF. After 3 days, pre-OCs were lifted with trypsin, washed in PBS, counted, and used for cell spreading or migration assays. For cell spreading, cells were plated onto osteopontin-coated coverslips and adhered for 30 min in either the presence or absence of 20 units/ml Epo. Adherent cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with crystal violet. For migration assay, cells were placed in transwell filters (8-μm pore size; Costar, Cambridge, MA) pre-coated with serum and allowed to migrate for 6 h toward a gradient of 20 units/ml Epo or medium alone. Cells on the lower surface of the filter were viewed at ×300 magnification in a bright field and counted. Results represent the mean value from 15 fields ± S.E. of a representative experiment. Rac Assays—Pre-OCs expressing the indicated EpoR/c-Fms mutants were stimulated with Epo for 5 min and lysed as described previously (12Faccio R. Novack D.V. Zallone A. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 499-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Lysates were subjected to a Rac pull-down assay using glutathione S-transferase-PAK1 beads (BD Transduction Laboratories). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed using SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting against Rac1 (BD Transduction Laboratories). M-CSF-dependent Cytoskeletal Organization in Osteoclasts Does Not Require Direct Recruitment of PI3K to c-Fms Tyr-721—Although PI3K mediates M-CSF-dependent cytoskeletal organization (31Palacio S. Felix R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 32Grey A. Chen Y. Paliwal I. Carlberg K. Insogna K. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the c-Fms tyrosine residue/s that regulate the cytoskeletal reorganization in response to M-CSF in OCs have not been identified. To address this issue, we generated a chimeric construct comprising the external domain of the EpoR linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms. This construct supported osteoclast differentiation and macrophage proliferation as well as endogenous c-Fms (28Feng X. Takeshita S. Namba N. Wei S. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We individually mutated the seven known functional Tyr residues in the cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms to Phe and inserted a FLAG sequence at the amino terminus of the EpoR/c-Fms construct to facilitate subsequent immunoprecipitation. BMMs were transduced with WT EpoR/c-Fms receptor or with mutated forms of EpoR/c-Fms, treated with Epo, and lysed, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG Ab followed by Western blot analysis. Using an antibody that recognized the cytoplasmic domain of c-Fms and thus could quantify both the endogenous and chimeric c-Fms receptors, we confirmed that expression levels of both receptors were similar (28Feng X. Takeshita S. Namba N. Wei S. Teitelbaum S.L. Ross F.P. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4868-4874Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As seen in Fig. 1A the sole Tyr to Phe mutation that abrogated Epo-induced p85 binding was Tyr-721. To confirm that Tyr-721 was a p85 binding site, we generated an EpoR/c-Fms receptor in which Tyr-721 was added back to a null form of the chimera, in which all seven functional Tyr residues had been replaced by Phe (Tyr-721 add-back). This single add-back construct recruited the p85 subunit of PI3K as effectively as the WT chimera (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, add-back Tyr-721, but not mutated Tyr-721, underwent tyrosine phosphorylation when stimulated for 5 min with Epo (Fig. 1C). These data, coupled with the information that two specific inhibitors of p85, wortmannin or LY294002, inhibited cytoskeletal organization (31Palacio S. Felix R. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), suggested that recruitment of PI3K to c-Fms could be critical in mediating M-CSF-dependent cytoskeletal organization. To test this hypothesis, we generated OCs from primary BMMs transduced with the WT or the Phe-721-mutated chimera in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF and then treated these cells with Epo to examine subsequent cytoskeletal reorganization dependent on the chimeric EpoR/c-Fms receptor. Similar to the effects of M-CSF on WT OCs (Fig. 2A), 5 min of Epo treatment of cells expressing WT EpoR/c-Fms induced rapid podosome redistribution from a peripheral belt to the cell surface, yielding to numerous membrane ruffles (Fig. 2B+, insert), whereas vector alone-transduced cells failed to respond (Fig. 2C+, insert). Given that c-Fms Tyr-721 recruited PI3K, it was surprising that the Phe-721 EpoR/c-Fms responded to Epo in a manner indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 2D+, insert). Similar to OCs, macrophages expressing WT EpoR/c-Fms responded to Epo with rapid changes in actin reorganization, leading to accumulation of F-actin at the cell periphery (Fig. 2F, WT, arrows). Again, mutation of the c-Fms PI3K binding site Tyr-721 to Phe resulted in Epo-induced morphological changes indistinguishable from WT (Fig. 2F, F721, arrows).FIGURE 2Cytoskeletal changes induced by c-Fms require functional Tyr-559 but not Tyr-721. A, WTOCs were stimulated for 5 min with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) or vehicle alone (CTR), fixed, and subjected to immunofluorescence analysis with fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin to detect actin organization. B-E, mature OCs bearing WT EpoR/c-Fms (B), empty vector pMX-puro (C), mutated Phe-721 (D), and Phe-559 chimeras (E) were stimulated with Epo for 5 min (20 units/ml) and analyzed as in panel A. Each insert represents an enlarged image (2×) of a specific region of the cell margin. F, macrophages expressing empty vector (CTR) or bearing WT EpoR/c-Fms or the chimeras Phe-721 and Phe-559 were exposed to Epo for 5 min, fixed, and stained as described before.

Studies involving overexpression of c-Fms in transformed fibroblasts had shown that SFKs bind to c-Fms via Tyr-559 (35Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that this Tyr residue might be important in the M-CSF-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in OCs. We first confirmed that Tyr-559 was indeed an SFK binding site in primary macrophages (see Fig. 5A, middle panel). Next, we evaluated Epo-dependent cytoskeletal reorganization in mature OCs and BMMs expressing EpoR/c-Fms Phe-559 and found that in both cell types the mutated EpoR/c-Fms receptor failed to promote cytoskeletal reorganization in response to Epo stimulation (Fig. 2, E and F+, insert). This result was specific for mutation in Tyr-559 because all other single Tyr to Phe mutated forms of EpoR/c-Fms continued to stimulate actin remodeling (not shown). M-CSF treatment of c-Fms-expressing cells leads to increased motility, an event involving PI3K (23Pilkington M.F. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17660-17666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether movement of cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage was mediated via c-Fms Tyr-721 and/or Tyr-559. We measured the migratory capacity of OC precursors expressing WT or mutated Tyr-721 and Tyr-559 chimeric receptors by plating them on serum-coated transwell filters and counting the number of cells migrating toward Epo-containing medium or one lacking the cytokine. Reflecting actin reorganization, Epo-directed cell motility was enhanced in cells bearing WT and Phe-721 chimeras (Fig. 3A) despite the established migratory suppressive effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3B and Ref. (23Pilkington M.F. Sims S.M. Dixon S.J. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1998; 13: 688-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). In contrast to Phe-721, Phe-559 chimera clearly decreased the chemotactic response toward Epo (Fig. 3A). Further support for the contention that binding of SFKs to c-Fms Tyr-559 was required for cytoskeletal organization and motility was provided by the fact that PP2, the Src kinase inhibitor, completely blocked Epo-induced migration of OC precursors expressing WT EpoR/c-Fms chimeric receptor (Fig. 3B). These observations, along with the fact that inhibition of PI3K activation by LY294002 also negatively affected cell motility (Fig. 3B) and membrane ruffling (not shown), indicated that both SFKs and PI3K mediated M-CSF-dependent migration. However, our data suggested the direct binding of PI3K to c-Fms Tyr-721 was not required for M-CSF-induced cell motility and actin dynamics, whereas intact c-Fms Tyr-559 was required for M-CSF-mediated cytoskeletal changes. One possibility was that PI3K might govern cytoskeletal reorganization by binding to other cytoplasmic Tyr residues in the RTK. Because c-Fms Tyr-721 was the sole residue directly binding PI3K in response to M-CSF (Fig. 1), this kinase could be indirectly recruited to the RTK by forming a complex with signaling molecules involved in M-CSF signaling. Therefore, it seemed likely that SFKs and PI3K shared a common signaling pathway downstream of Tyr-559, an issue addressed below. c-Cbl Interacts with SFKs and PI3K in a Manner Requiring c-Fms Tyr-559—c-Fms Tyr-559 is a known binding site for SFKs in macrophages (35Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and in the myeloid cell line M1 (38Marks D.C. Csar X.F.

Following attachment of macrophages and OCs on an αvβ3-dependent substrate, c-Src recruits and phosphorylates c-Cbl at Tyr-731 (33Miyazaki T. Sanjay A. Neff L. Tanaka S. Horne W.C. Baron R. J. Biol.

Lowell C.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4391-4403Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Thus, we determined whether an SFK·c-Cbl complex was recruited to c-Fms in OC precursors by treating cells with M-CSF, immunoprecipitating the cell lysates with c-Cbl, and blotting for c-Fms. As seen in Fig. 4A, binding of c-Cbl to the c-Fms receptor occurred upon M-CSF stimulation. Moreover, this interaction was dramatically decreased in c-Src-deficient cells (Fig. 4A). Given that c-Src binds Tyr-559 in c-Fms and that the SFK and c-Cbl are known to interact in other circumstances (40Fukazawa T. Reedquist K.A. Trub T. Soltoff S. Panchamoorthy G. Druker B. Cantley L. Shoelson S.E. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19141-19150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), we used our chimeric receptor approach to examine the role of Tyr-559 in recruitment of c-Cbl to the RTK. Cells transduced with WT chimera and those expressing Phe-559 were treated with Epo and examined for binding of c-Cbl and SFKs. Within 5 min of Epo exposure, c-Cbl and SFKs were recruited to the WT chimeric receptor, whereas the mutated Phe-559 was incapable of inducing the same interaction (Fig. 4B). Similar to WT, Phe-721 mutated receptor was capable of supporting the recruitment of c-Cbl and SFKs to c-Fms receptor following Epo stimulation. Consistent with the role of c-Cbl as a ubiquitin ligase (41Schmidt M.H. Dikic I. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 907-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), the WT and Phe-721 receptors were degraded significantly within 30 min of Epo exposure, contrasting with minimal change in the Phe-559 mutated receptor (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The fact that Tyr-559 is a site for recruitment of an SFK·c-Cbl complex, coupled with the knowledge that c-Cbl has been reported to bind PI3K (42Soltoff S.P. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 563-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), suggested that c-Cbl might act as adaptor molecule mediating formation of a complex between SFK and p85. In keeping with this hypothesis, reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblots demonstrated that although binding of c-Cbl to SFKs in OC precursors transduced with WT chimera was stimulated after treatment with Epo, the same interaction was not increased in cells expressing c-Fms Phe-559 (Fig. 5A and not shown). Cytokine-induced c-Cbl phosphorylation and binding of c-Cbl to SFKs is markedly decreased by the SFK inhibitor PP2 and significantly inhibited in cells derived from c-Src null mice (F"

The pgs1Δ mutant, lacking the first enzyme of the CL pathway, phosphatidylglycerolphosphate synthase (Pgs1p), has a defective cell wall due to decreased β-1,3-glucan (Zhong, Q., Gvozdenovic-Jeremic, J., Webster, P., Zhou, J., and Greenberg, M. L. (2005) Mol. Biol. Cell 16, 665–675). Disruption of KRE5, a gene involved in cell wall biogenesis, restores β-1,3-glucan synthesis and suppresses pgs1Δ temperature sensitivity. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying the cell wall defect in pgs1Δ, we show in the current report that pgs1Δ cells have reduced glucan synthase activity and diminished levels of Fks1p, the glucan synthase catalytic subunit. In addition, activation of Slt2p, the downstream effector of the protein kinase C (PKC)-activated cell integrity pathway, was defective in pgs1Δ. The kre5W1166X suppressor restored Slt2p activation and dramatically increased (>10-fold) mRNA levels of FKS2, the alternate catalytic subunit of glucan synthase, partially restoring glucan synthase activity. Consistent with these results, up-regulation of PKC-Slt2 signaling and overexpression of FKS1 or FKS2 alleviated sensitivity of pgs1Δ to cell wall-perturbing agents and restored growth at elevated temperature. These findings demonstrate that functional Pgs1p is essential for cell wall biogenesis and activation of the PKC-Slt2 signaling pathway.

It is primarily found in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where it interacts with and is required for the optimal activities of a large number of proteins. The importance of CL in mitochondrial function is underscored by the discovery that defective CL remodeling is associated with the severe X-linked genetic disorder Barth syndrome, which is characterized by cardiomyopathy, neutropenia, skeletal myopathy, and respiratory chain defects (2.Vreken P.

Barth syndrome is due to mutations in a single gene (G4.5) encoding the protein tafazzin, a transacylase that remodels CL (3.Xu Y. Malhotra A. Ren M. Schlame M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39217-39224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The clinical presentation of Barth syndrome varies widely, even among patients who have the identical tafazzin mutation, suggesting that the phenotype is dependent upon multiple factors that are not well understood (4.Barth P.G.

Interestingly, these mutants also exhibit cellular defects that are not attributed to mitochondrial bioenergetics. The most severe growth defects are exhibited by the pgs1Δ mutant, which cannot grow on any medium at 37 °C (6.Chang S.C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

The crd1Δ mutant loses viability after prolonged growth on both fermentable and nonfermentable media and does not form colonies from single cells at elevated temperature even on glucose (11.Jiang F.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). These growth defects suggest that the CL pathway plays an essential role in maintaining cell viability in response to the stress of increased temperature. In order to understand the essential functions of the CL pathway, we took the genetic approach of isolating spontaneous mutants that suppress defective growth of pgs1Δ at elevated temperatures. One such suppressor mutant contained a loss of function mutation in KRE5, a gene involved in cell wall biogenesis (1.Zhong Q. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Webster P. Zhou J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Subsequent biochemical analysis of the pgs1Δ cell wall revealed a decrease in β-1,3-glucan levels, which were restored in the presence of the kre5W1166X suppressor. These findings were consistent with a large scale screen by Lussier et al. (20.Lussier M. White A.M. Sheraton J. di Paolo T. Treadwell J. Southard S.B. Horenstein C.I. Chen-Weiner J. Ram A.F. Kapteyn J.C. Roemer T.W. Vo D.H. Bondoc D.C. Hall J. Zhong W.W. Sdicu A.M. Davies J. Klis F.M. Robbins P.W. Bussey H. Genetics. 1997; 147: 435-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to identify genes involved in cell wall biogenesis, in which it was reported that disruption of the promoter of PGS1 leads to hypersensitivity to cell wall-perturbing agents. Stabilization of the cell wall with osmotic support suppressed the temperature sensitivity of pgs1Δ, suggesting that the growth defects of pgs1Δ are associated with cell wall biogenesis. The decreased β-1,3-glucan levels in pgs1Δ suggested an intriguing link between the CL pathway, which is localized in the mitochondria, and β-glucan synthesis in the plasma membrane. The current study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanisms whereby these pathways are linked. Yeast β-1,3-glucan is synthesized by glucan synthase (21.Qadota H. Python C.P. Inoue S.B. Arisawa M.

As shown in Fig. 1, Rho1p alternates between GDP-bound inactive and GTP-bound active states (25.Ihara K. Muraguchi S. Kato M. Shimizu T. Shirakawa M. Kuroda S. Kaibuchi K. Hakoshima T. J. Biol.

Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 699-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Rho1p is regulated by a variety of effectors. The putative cell surface sensor protein Wsc1p activates Rho1p by stimulating nucleotide exchange through the GDP/GTP exchange factor, Rom2p (27.Philip B. Levin D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Lrg1p, a GTPase-activating protein, promotes formation of the inactive GDP-bound Rho1p (28.Watanabe D. Abe M. Ohya Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Posttranslational modification of Rho1p by the geranylgeranyl group is required for binding and activation of glucan synthase (29.Inoue S.B. Qadota H. Arisawa M. Watanabe T. Ohya Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38119-38124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of glucan synthase is also subject to regulation. Movement of Fks1p, which is required for the construction of a uniform and solid cell wall, is driven by actin (30.Utsugi T. Minemura M. Hirata A. Abe M. Watanabe D. Ohya Y. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Transcription of FKS2 is activated in response to cell wall stress induced by heat, cell wall mutations, and cell wall-perturbing agents (31.Zhao C. Jung U.S. Garrett-Engele P. Roe T. Cyert M.S.

A striking example of FKS2 activation is the 114-fold increase in FKS2 expression in the kre5 mutant (35.Kapteyn J.C. Van Egmond P. Sievi E. Van Den Ende H. Makarow M. Klis F.M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1835-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cell wall biogenesis is also controlled by the cell integrity pathway, which consists of a family of cell surface sensor proteins, Rho1p, protein kinase C (PKC), and a downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (36.Heinisch J.J. Lorberg A. Schmitz H.P. Jacoby J.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 37.Levin D.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2005; 69: 262-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Activation of the cell integrity pathway is initiated by signals transmitted from cell wall sensor proteins to Rom2p, which stimulates formation of the GTP-bound activated form of Rho1p and the subsequent activation of Pkc1p. Pkc1p activates a cascade of phosphorylation reactions involving the MAPK kinase kinase Bck1p, the redundant MAPK kinases Mkk1p and Mkk2p, and the MAPK Slt2p. Signaling through the MAPK cascade results in dual phosphorylation and activation of Slt2p, which exerts its effects on cell wall biogenesis via two transcription factors, Rlm1p (38.Dodou E.

A constitutively activated PKC-Slt2 cell integrity pathway in cell wall mutants fks1Δ and gas1Δ leads to increased FKS2 expression and an Slt2p-dependent increase in thermal resistance (32.de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M. Klis F.M. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2121-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism linking the CL pathway to cell wall biogenesis, we examined the possibility that glucan synthase and/or the PKC-Slt2 pathway are defective in the pgs1Δ mutant. Here we report that glucan synthase activity is decreased in pgs1Δ, accompanied by impaired cell integrity signaling in response to heat shock, both of which are restored in the presence of the kre5W1166X suppressor mutation. Overexpression of the glucan synthase catalytic subunits and up-regulation of PKC-Slt2 cell integrity signaling alleviate cell wall defects and restore growth at elevated temperatures. These data indicate that the CL pathway is required for glucan synthase activity and for activation of the PKC-Slt2 cell integrity pathway.

Logarithmic phase cells resuspended in 1 mm EDTA (pH 8) were subjected to mechanical breakage with glass beads. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by low speed centrifugation (5,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 60 min, and pellets were washed once with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Final pellets were resuspended in the same buffered solution containing 33% glycerol and stored at –20 °C. To determine glucan synthase activity, the standard reaction mixture contained 5.3 mm UDP-d-[14C]glucose (4 × 104 cpm/mmol), 80 μm GTPγS (Sigma), 0.8% bovine serum albumin, 2.2 mm EDTA, 75 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 8.25% (v/v) glycerol, and enzyme (100–200 μg of protein) in a total volume of 40 μl. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by adding 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The reaction mixture was transferred onto a fiberglass filter mat (Whatman GF/C), washed three times with 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid and twice with 1 ml of 95% ethanol, and then counted in a liquid scintillation counter. One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount that catalyzes the incorporation of 1 nmol of substrate (glucose) into glucan/min at 30 °C. Northern Blot Analysis−The nonhomologous regions of the FKS1 and FKS2 coding sequences were amplified using the following primers as described previously (22.Mazur P. Morin N.

The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled FKS1 or FKS2 riboprobes, followed by the riboprobe against the constitutively expressed actin filament protein gene ACT1 to normalize for loading variation. RNA probes for Northern blot analysis were synthesized using the Promega Riboprobe System and from plasmids linearized with restriction enzymes as follows (gene, restriction enzyme, RNA polymerase): FKS1, PstI, T7; FKS2, ApaI, SP6; ACT1, BamHI, SP6 (17.Kawasaki K.

The results were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Western Blot Analysis of Fks1p−Aliquots of crude extract (100 μg of protein) from cells grown to midlogarithmic phase in YPD were subjected to 6% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was incubated in 5% nonfat milk in a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C in the same buffer containing antibody against Fks1p (yN-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). The membrane was washed with TBS-T and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG antibody (Promega) at room temperature for 1.5 h. The color was developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Detection of Dually Phosphorylated Slt2p−Dual phosphorylation of Slt2p was determined as previously described with minor modifications (32.de Nobel H. Ruiz C. Martin H. Morris W. Brul S. Molina M.

Cells were collected on ice by adding 20 ml of the culture to an equal volume of ice in a Falcon centrifuge tube and pelleted in a refrigerated centrifuge. Cells were then transferred with 1 ml of ice-cold water to an Eppendorf tube, pelleted, and immediately frozen on dry ice for 15 min. Cells were subsequently lysed in 120 μl of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) by vigorous shaking with an equal amount of 0.45-mm glass beads. Cell extracts were separated from glass beads and cell debris, collected in a new Eppendorf tube by centrifugation, and further clarified by centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein samples (50 μg) were boiled for 5 min, 2× loading buffer was added, and samples were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed with either anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (Cell signaling Technology rabbit IgG) at a 1:1000 dilution to detect dually phosphorylated Slt2p or with anti-Slt2p goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1:100 dilution to detect Slt2p in the presence of 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. The primary antibody was detected using the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit/goat antibody (Promega) with an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Determination of Cell Wall β-Glucan−Alkaline soluble and insoluble β-glucan levels in the cell wall were measured as described previously (1.Zhong Q. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Webster P. Zhou J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The major cell wall defect observed in the pgs1Δ mutant was markedly reduced β-1,3-glucan, which was restored in the pgs1Δkre5W1166X double mutant (1.Zhong Q. Gvozdenovic-Jeremic J. Webster P. Zhou J. Greenberg M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 665-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). One likely explanation for reduced β-1,3-glucan is that glucan synthase activity is decreased in the pgs1Δ mutant. To address this possibility, glucan synthase activity was assayed in isogenic wild type, ρ0, pgs1Δ, and pgs1Δkre5W1166X cells. As seen in Fig. 2, glucan synthase activity was reduced to less than 30% of wild-type levels in the pgs1Δ mutant. Activity was partially restored by the kre5W1166X suppressor mutation. Wild type levels of glucan synthase activity were observed in petite mutants completely devoid of mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 strain), indicating that defects in respiration per se are not the cause of decreased glucan synthase activity in the pgs1Δ mutant. To understand the mechanism underlying reduced glucan synthase activity in the pgs1Δ mutant, expression of the glucan synthase catalytic subunits FKS1 and FKS2 was character"
https://openalex.org/W2053987947,"H4(D10S170) gene has been identified upon its frequent rearrangement with RET in papillary thyroid tumours (RET/PTC1). The kinase ataxia telangectasia mutated (ATM) phosphorylates a limited number of downstream protein targets in response to DNA damage. We investigated the potential role of H4(D10S170) in DNA damage signaling pathways. We found that in cells treated with etoposide or ionizing radiation (IR), H4(D10S170) underwent ATM-mediated phosphorylation at Thr 434, stabilizing nuclear H4. In ataxia telangectasia cells (A-T), endogenous H4(D10S170) was localized to cytoplasm and was excluded from the nucleus. Moreover, H4(D10S170) was not phosphorylated in ATM-deficient lymphoblasts after ionizing irradiation. Inhibition of ATM kinase interfered with H4(D10S170) apoptotic activity, and expression of H4 with threonine 434 mutated in Alanine, H4T434A, protected the cells from genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis. Most importantly, after exposure to IR we found that silencing of H4(D10S170) in mammalian cells increased cell survival, as shown by clonogenic assay, allows for DNA synthesis as evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and permits cells to progress into mitosis as demonstrated by phosphorylation on Histone H3. Our results suggest that H4(D10S170) is involved in cellular response to DNA damage ATM-mediated, and that the impairment of H4(D10S170) gene function might have a role in thyroid carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973870789,"Background Malaria is one of the strongest recent selective pressures on the human genome, as evidenced by the high levels of varying haemoglobinopathies in human populations–despite the increased risk of mortality in the homozygous states. Previously, functional polymorphisms of Hp, coded by the co-dominant alleles Hp1 and Hp2, have been variously associated with several infectious diseases, including malaria susceptibility. Methodology/Principal Findings Risk of a clinical malarial episode over the course of a malarial transmission season was assessed using active surveillance in a cohort of Gambian children aged 10–72 months. We report for the first time that the major haplotype for the A-61C mutant allele in the promoter of haptoglobin (Hp)–an acute phase protein that clears haemoglobin released from haemolysis of red cells–is associated with protection from malarial infection in older children, (children aged ≥36 months, >500 parasites/ul and temperature >37.5°C; OR = 0.42; [95% CI 0.24–0.73] p = 0.002) (lr test for interaction, <36 vs ≥36 months, p = 0.014). Protection was also observed using two other definitions, including temperature >37.5°C, dipstick positive, plus clinical judgement of malaria blinded to dipstick result (all ages, OR = 0.48, [95% CI 0.30–0.78] p = 0.003; ≥36 months, OR = 0.31, [95% CI 0.15–0.62] p = 0.001). A similar level of protection was observed for the known protective genetic variant, sickle cell trait (HbAS). Conclusions/Significance We propose that previous conflicting results between Hp phenotypes/genotypes and malaria susceptibility may be explained by differing prevalence of the A-61C SNP in the populations studied, which we found to be highly associated with the Hp2 allele. We report the -61C allele to be associated with decreased Hp protein levels (independent of Hp phenotype), confirming in vitro studies. Decreased Hp expression may lead to increased oxidant stress and increased red cell turnover, and facilitate the development of acquired immunity, similar to a mechanism suggested for sickle cell trait."
https://openalex.org/W2028767748,"The nuclear pore complex is the gateway for selective traffic between the nucleus and cytoplasm. To learn how building blocks of the pore can create specific docking sites for transport receptors and regulatory factors, we have studied a zinc finger module present in multiple copies within the nuclear pores of higher eukaryotes. All four zinc fingers of human Nup153 were found to bind the small GTPase Ran with dissociation constants ranging between 5 and 40 μm. In addition a fragment of Nup153 encompassing the four tandem zinc fingers was found to bind Ran with similar affinity. NMR structural studies revealed that a representative Nup153 zinc finger adopts the same zinc ribbon structure as the previously characterized Npl4 NZF module. Ran binding was mediated by a three-amino acid motif (Leu13/Val14/Asn25) located within the two zinc coordination loops. Nup153 ZnFs bound GDP and GTP forms of Ran with similar affinities, indicating that this interaction is not influenced by a nucleotide-dependent conformational switch. Taken together, these studies elucidate the Ran-binding interface on Nup153 and, more broadly, provide insight into the versatility of this zinc finger binding module.

In eukaryotic cells, nucleocytoplasmic transport is a critical function for maintaining basic processes such as cell cycle regulation and gene expression. Transport across the nuclear envelope occurs through nuclear pore complexes, large macromolecular structures of ∼125 MDa that are embedded in the nuclear envelope. Nuclear pore complexes are comprised of three major architectural features: 1) a central framework, which includes integral membrane proteins and resides within the plane of the membrane; 2) a cytoplasmic ring and its extended filaments; and 3) a nuclear basket, which is composed of distal and proximal rings connected by eight fibers (reviewed in Ref. 1Lim R.Y.

RanBP2-type zinc fingers conform to the consensus sequence pattern: W-X-C-X(2,4)-C-X(3)-N-X(6)-C-X (2)-C. This module is found in a functionally diverse population of proteins, with more than 1055 matches in 727 polypeptides using the ScanProsite tool. A similar consensus sequence that omits the initial tryptophan and allows only two residues between the first two cysteines defines a related polypeptide family termed Npl4 zinc fingers (NZF) (23Meyer H.H.

The sequence conservation can be rationalized because each conserved residue performs an important structural role: the four cysteine residues coordinate zinc, the Trp residue forms the hydrophobic core of the module, and the Asn residue bridges strands 2 and 3. The small RanBP2/NZF module is a “stripped down” member of the much larger zinc ribbon family, whose members all utilize two β-hairpins to coordinate a single zinc ion between two Cys2 “knuckles.” Zinc ribbon proteins diverge significantly beyond the zinc coordination site, however, and frequently have complex structural elements inserted between the two knuckles (28Krishna S.S.

A better understanding of how different NZF family members recognize their cognate binding partners will be important for defining, and ultimately predicting, ligand specificity in this large protein family. The zinc fingers found in Nup153 and Nup358 (hereafter referred to as Nup ZnF) are distinctive in that they are found in repetitive arrays. In addition to conforming to the RanBP2-type consensus, these zinc fingers exhibit additional sequence conservation at several non-structural positions, particularly Leu13 (64% conserved), Val14 (79%), and Ala25 (79%) (numbering schemes are given in Figs. 1 and supplemental Fig. S1 and conservation is calculated for the representative sequences shown in Fig. S1). The equivalent three positions define the ligand binding site in the Npl4 zinc finger motif (25Alam S.L. Sun J. Payne M. Welch B.D. Blake B.K. Davis D.R. Meyer H.H. Emr S.D. Sundquist W.I. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Notably, Nup ZnF modules are present only in higher eukaryotes, suggesting a specialized role(s) in nuclear pore function. Consistent with this idea, the Nup ZnF regions of Nup153 and Nup358 are important in orchestrating mitotic nuclear envelope breakdown, a type of nuclear membrane remodeling unique to higher eukaryotes. In this context, the Nup ZnFs are proposed to serve as a scaffold for recruitment of the coatomer complex COPI (18Liu J. Prunuske A.J. Fager A.M. Ullman K.S. Dev.

Cell. 2006; 17: 760-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Other proteins that associate with Nup ZnF regions include the small GTPase Ran and the transport receptor exportin 1 (32Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G.

Cell. 2003; 112: 441-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar and 35Quimby B.B. Dasso M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar)), Ran binding by the Nup ZnF regions may be important in helping to regulate traffic through the higher eukaryotic pore. As a Ras-like GTPase, Ran fits the paradigm in which GTP and GDP binding create distinct conformational states, allowing Ran to serve as a molecular switch (36Chook Y.M. Blobel G.

Previous studies have suggested that RanGDP, but not RanGTP, binds specifically to the Nup ZnF regions (32Nakielny S. Shaikh S. Burke B. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1982-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 34Yaseen N.R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5516-5521Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which is of potential interest because the roles of Ran often depend critically on its nucleotide state. To begin to investigate how Nup ZnF modules function in nuclear pore biology, we have determined the three-dimensional structure of a nucleoporin zinc finger and characterized its Ran binding properties. Plasmid Construction—Plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table SII. The expression construct for wild-type ZnF2 from human Nup153 was created by cloning annealed oligonucleotides 3 and 4 (Table SIII) into the NdeI/BamHI sites of a pGEX2T vector modified to contain a TEV cleavage site between the GST and ZnF2 polypeptides (WISP01-69). Inserts for human Nup153 zinc fingers 1, 3, and 4 were created by PCR amplification from full-length Nup153 and subcloned into WISP01-69 using NdeI/XhoI. All site-directed mutations were created using QuikChange™ mutagenesis (Stratagene). For the Nup153 ZnF constructs L13T and V14F mutations were first introduced using oligonucleotides 9 and 10 (Table SIII), and this construct was then mutated further to alter Ala25 to Met using oligonucleotides 11 and 12 (Table SIII). Expression constructs for wild-type Npl4 NZF domain and the T13L,F14V mutant were described previously (24Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1411-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The latter construct was mutated further to create the T14L,F15V,M25A mutant using oligonucleotides 13 and 14 (Table SIII). The GST-Ran construct was a kind gift from Sally Kornbluth (Duke University). Site-directed mutation of this construct to create GST-RanQ69L was performed using oligonucleotides 17 and 18 (Table SII). His-tagged importin β fragments 1–462 and 45–462 in pQE60 (Qiagen) were a kind gift from Dirk Görlich (University of Heidelberg) (40Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Recombinant Ran—To produce Ran for use as the analyte in biosensor experiments, 10-liter cultures of BL21(DE3) RIL cells (Stratagene), transformed with Ran expression vectors, were grown at 37 °C in a fermenter to an A600 of ∼0.8. Isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to 1 mm and the culture grown for an additional ∼15 h at 22 °C. Following centrifugation, pellets from 2 liters of culture were resuspended in 100 ml of Buffer A (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME, 1 mm DTT). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged to remove insoluble debris. GST-Ran was recovered from the cleared lysate by fast protein liquid chromatography using a GSTPrep FF 16/10 affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). After washing with 4 column volumes of buffer A, protein was eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME, and 1 mm DTT. Eluted protein was then dialyzed overnight into 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT in the presence of thrombin (Calbiochem; ∼0.5 units/mg GST-Ran). Ran was purified away from GST by sequential anion and cation chromatography steps. Flow-through fractions from a DEAE-Sepharose column were applied to an S-Sepharose column. A salt gradient (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 50–1000 mm KCl) was used to elute protein from the S-Sepharose column, but Ran largely eluted in 50 mm KCl fractions. Material from these fractions was concentrated and residual GST and GST-Ran were removed by passage over 1.5 ml of glutathione-Sepharose. Purified Ran was loaded with nucleotide (see below), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. This procedure typically resulted in a yield of ∼10 mg of Ran per 2-liter pellet. Thrombin cleavage of GST-Ran resulted in 15 non-native N-terminal amino acid residues (NH2-GSPGISGGGGGILDS). Precise cleavage by thrombin was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (calculated mass, 25,635 Da; observed mass, 25,634 Da). Thrombin-cleaved GST-Ran was used for the binding experiments reported herein. A GST-Ran construct with a TEV protease cleavage site was also cloned and purified (Fig. S2 and supplementary methods) to produce a protein with only one non-native N-terminal amino acid residue (NH2-S). The Nup153 ZnF binding affinities of this shorter Ran construct were similar to those of the longer thrombin-cleaved Ran protein (data not shown). Purities and concentrations of Ran preparations were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and amino acid analyses, respectively. GST-Ran immobilized on biosensor chips was prepared slightly differently: pellets from 1-liter cultures were resuspended in 40 ml of Buffer B (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-ME with 1/2 tablet of Complete protease inhibitor (Roche Applied Science)) and sonicated. Cleared lysates were applied to a 1.5-ml bed volume of glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The column was washed with 10 bed volumes of Buffer B and eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, and 10 μm ZnCl2. Eluates were dialyzed overnight against the same buffer without glutathione and then concentrated to 1–3 ml prior to loading with nucleotide and biosensor analysis. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Zinc Finger Domains—To prepare pure Nup153 ZnF for biosensor binding experiments, BL21(DE3) RIL cells containing the Nup153 ZnF2 expression construct were grown at 37 °C in a fermentor to an A600 of ∼0.5. Protein expression was induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm) and protein allowed to accumulate for an additional 4 h. Following centrifugation, a pellet from 6 liters of culture was resuspended in ZnF Buffer (10 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-ME, 10 μm ZnCl2). All purification steps were performed at 4 °C. Bacteria were lysed by sonication and the lysate was centrifuged (40,000 × g for 30 min) to remove insoluble debris. GST-Nup153 ZnF2 was recovered from the cleared lysate by affinity chromatography using a GSTPrep FF 16/10 affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound protein was washed with 10 column volumes of ZnF buffer and eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm β-ME, and 10 μm ZnCl2. Protein fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 16 h into 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, 1 mm DTT in the presence of recombinant TEV protease (10 μg/mg GST-Nup153 ZnF2). The protein solution was concentrated to ∼3 ml, and residual GST-Nup153 ZnF2 and GST were removed by Superdex-75 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-ME, 2 mm DTT, and 10 μm ZnCl2. TEV protease cleavage left three non-native residues at the N terminus of ZnF2 (NH2-GHM), but the first native amino acid was designated Val3 to keep the numbering consistent with the NZF consensus (24Wang B.

GST-Nup153 ZnF fusion proteins were captured onto biosensor chips directly from fresh, cleared bacterial lysates. Protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.8–1 A600, 5 h, 25 °C). Pellets from 2 ml of culture were resuspended in either B-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) or Buffer B supplemented with 10 μm ZnCl2 (most experiments used the latter). Cells resuspended in B-PER buffer were rotated at room temperature for 10 min, followed by sonication and centrifugation. Cells resuspended in Buffer B were supplemented with lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and incubated on ice for 20 min, followed by sonication and centrifugation. Expression and Purification of Importin β Fragments—BL21(DE3) RIL cells transformed with expression vectors for His6-importin β-(1–462) or His6-importin β-(45–462) (40Kutay U. Izaurralde E. Bischoff F.R. Mattaj I.W. Gorlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1153-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.8–1.0 and protein expression was induced (1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, 4 h, 21 °C). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-ME and sonicated (all steps at 4 °C). Cleared lysates were incubated in batch with 1 ml of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen) overnight and washed with 10 bed volumes of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The His-tagged proteins were eluted with 100 mm glycine, pH 3.0, and immediately neutralized. Nucleotide Loading of Ran—Nucleotide (2 mm) and EDTA (10 mm) were added to Ran preparations and the samples were rotated at room temperature for 30 min. MgCl2 was then added to a final concentration of 20 mm (41Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Preparation of Samples for NMR Spectroscopy—Unlabeled human ubiquitin and 15N- and 15N/13C-labeled Nup153 ZnF2 were expressed and purified as described previously (24Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with the exception that the TEV protease cleavage buffer used included 5 mm sodium citrate and 5 mm β-ME in place of DTT. Purifications typically yielded 4–5 mg of pure Nup153 ZnF2 and 40 mg of ubiquitin per liter of culture. Samples for structure determinations were 1 mm labeled protein in NMR buffer (20 mm D11-Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm D6-βME, 10 μm ZnCl2, pH 7.0, in 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O). Samples were degassed and flame-sealed under argon in NMR sample tubes to reduce cysteine oxidation. NMR Data Collection and Resonance Assignments—All NMR spectra were collected at 20 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance 1H/13C/15N Cold-Probe and z-axis pulsed field gradient capability. Backbone resonances were assigned using a suite of triple resonance experiments as described previously (24Wang B. Alam S.L. Meyer H.H. Payne M. Stemmler T.L. Davis D.R. Sundquist W.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20225-20234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), employing two-dimensional versions of the HNCACB (42Wittekind M. J. Magn. Reson.

Soc. 1994; 116: 6464-6465Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Side chain assignments were completed using three-dimensional H(CCO)NH-TOCSY, (H)C(CCO)NH-TOCSY (44Grzesiek S. Anglister J. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1993; 101: 114-119Crossref Scopus (584) Google Scholar), HCCH-TOCSY, HCCH-COSY, and 15N-edited TOCSY experiments. Aromatic resonances were assigned using a combination of 1H,13C-HSQC, 13C-edited NOESY experiments centered on the aromatic carbon resonances (125 ppm), a 13C-edited NOESY experiment centered on the aliphatic region, and heteronuclear correlation experiments that correlate the Cβ carbons to the Cδ and Cϵ protons of the aromatic rings (45Slupsky C.M. Gentile L.N. McIntosh L.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 379-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Stereospecific assignments for β-methylene protons and χ1 dihedral angle estimates were obtained using a combination of HNHB, HN(CO)HB (46Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C.

Three-bond coupling constants (3JHN-HA) were obtained from a three-dimensional HNHA experiment (52Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) and ϕ/ψ dihedral restraints were derived from backbone Hα,Cα, CO, Cβ chemical shifts using TALOS (53Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed with FELIX 2004 (Accelrys) and referenced indirectly to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic acid (53Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2731) Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Backbone and side chain correlations were assigned and NOE intensities were integrated using tools in SPARKY. 5T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco, CA. The solution structure of Nup153 ZnF2 was refined using automated NOE assignments and torsion angle dynamics as implemented in CYANA (version 2.1) (54Guntert P. Methods Mol.

Initial refinements used NOE data alone to define the overall fold. Once the zinc coordination geometry was established, the final refinements added restraints for zinc-sulfur distances, cysteine-Sγ to Sγ distances, Zn to Cβ distances (14 total), dihedral restraints (25Alam S.L.

The activity of ATM kinase is activated by DNA damage, and this activation is required for cells to survive genotoxic events. In addition to this well characterized role in DNA repair, we now demonstrate a novel role for ATM in the retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells into post-mitotic, neuronal-like cells. RA rapidly activates the activity of ATM kinase, leading to the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of the CREB protein, extrusion of neuritic processes, and differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells into neuronal-like cells. When ATM protein expression was suppressed by short hairpin RNA, the ATM-dependent phosphorylation of CREB was blocked. Furthermore, ATM-negative cells failed to differentiate into neuronal-like cells when exposed to retinoic acid; instead, they underwent cell death. Expression of a constitutively active CREBVP16 construct, or exposure to forskolin to induce CREB phosphorylation, rescued ATM negative cells and restored differentiation. Furthermore, when dominant negative CREB proteins with mutations in either the CREB phosphorylation site (CREBS133A) or the DNA binding domain (KCREB) were introduced into SH-SY5Y cells, retinoic acid-induced differentiation was blocked and the cells underwent cell death. The results demonstrate that ATM is required for the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells through the ATM dependent-phosphorylation of serine 133 of CREB. These results therefore define a novel mechanism for activation of the activity of ATM kinase by RA, and implicate ATM in the regulation of CREB function during RA-induced differentiation.

The product of the A-T gene, the ATM protein kinase, is a key component of the signal transduction pathway activated by DNA damage (3.Shiloh Y. Nat. Rev.

Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 11.Kozlov S.V. Graham M.E. Peng C. Chen P. Robinson P.J. Lavin M.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3504-3514Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), although the exact contribution of ATM autophosphorylation to ATM activation is still under debate (12.Pellegrini M. Celeste A. Difilippantonio S. Guo R. Wang W. Feigenbaum L. Nussenzweig A. Nature. 2006; 443: 222-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Several additional proteins are involved in activation of ATM kinase, including the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex, and the Tip60 histone acetyltransferase (13.Jiang X. Sun Y. Chen S. Roy K. Price B.D. J.

The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex contains a specific ATM binding domain that is required for recruitment of ATM to sites of DNA damage (17.Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Subsequent activation of ATM depends on the Tip60-dependent acetylation of the ATM protein, which is proposed as the trigger for activating the kinase activity of ATM (13.Jiang X. Sun Y. Chen S. Roy K. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15741-15746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14.Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). In addition to activation of ATM by DNA damage, ATM participates in cellular pathways that are not directly linked to the DNA damage response. For example, compounds that alter chromatin structure, such as trichostatin A or chloroquine, can activate the kinase activity of ATM independently of DNA damage (5.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Insulin can also up-regulate the kinase activity of ATM (18.Yang D.Q. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), leading to the phosphorylation of insulin target proteins, including protein kinase B and the eIF-4e-binding protein (18.Yang D.Q. Kastan M.B. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 893-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19.Viniegra J.G. Martinez N. Modirassari P. Losa J.H. Parada Cobo C. Lobo V.J. Luquero C.I.

The ATM protein can also influence the levels of the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor in cells (20.Peretz S. Jensen R. Baserga R. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1676-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These observations are consistent with the clinical pathology of A-T, which includes mild diabetes and endocrine growth defects (1.Sedgewick R. Boder E. Vinken P.J. Bruyn G.W. Klavans H.L. Handbook of Clinical Neurology. Vol. 61. Elsevier, Amstersdam1991: 347-423Google Scholar, 2.Meyn M.S. Clin. Genet. 1999; 55: 289-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). ATM can therefore participate in multiple growth factor signaling pathways in addition to the DNA damage response. Here, the role of the ATM protein kinase in non-DNA damage-dependent pathways was investigated. In particular, the function of ATM in growth factor-regulated cellular differentiation was examined. A well characterized system for studying differentiation is the retinoic acid (RA)-dependent differentiation of neuroblastoma cells into post-mitotic neuronal-like cells. Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to RA stimulates RA-dependent gene transcription (reviewed in Ref. 21.Bastien J. Rochette-Egly C. Gene (Amst.). 2004; 328: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar), up-regulating a diverse array of genes, including TrkB, the receptor for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), making the cells responsive to BDNF (22.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Sequential exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to retinoic acid and BDNF results in growth arrest and differentiation of the SH-SY5Y cells into post-mitotic neuronal-like cells (24.Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). The fully differentiated SH-SY5Y cells exhibit widespread neuritic arborization, and express multiple neuronal proteins, including tau, GAP-43, MAP-2, transglutaminase, β-amyloid and others (22.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 278-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A.

Here, we demonstrate that RA rapidly activates the kinase activity of ATM leading to phosphorylation of the CREB protein and differentiation of the SH-SY5Y cells into post-mitotic neuronal-like cells. Inactivation of either ATM or CREB blocks RA-driven differentiation, and results in cell death. The results demonstrate a key role for ATM in the RA-dependent differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. Cell Culture−SH-SY5Y cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Eagle’s minimum essential medium and Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), non-essential amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and HEPES buffer. For differentiation experiments, cells were plated at 30% confluence and allowed to grow for 24 h. All-trans-retinoic acid (Biomol, PA) was added to 15 μm and cells were maintained in RA for 5 days, with media change every day. Cells were then washed in serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium to remove serum and RA, and incubated in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with BDNF (50 ng/ml) for 7 days. Phase-contrast photography of cell lines was carried out using a light microscope and a Nikon Cool-pix digital camera. For shRNA experiments, plasmid pBS/U6ATM601 (described in Ref. 27.Chen S. Wang G. Makrigiorgos G.M. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which contains an shRNA sequence targeting nucleotides 601-618 of ATM (GGGAGCTGATTGTAGCAACATAAGCTTATGTTGCTACAATCAGCTCCC) was transfected into SH-SY5Y cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and individual clones selected using hygromycin (300 μg/ml). An ATM cDNA with 3 base changes in the shRNA targeting site (nucleotides 601-618 of ATM, base changes underlined: AGCCGATTGCAGTAACAT), which altered codon usage but did not change the amino acid sequence, was constructed. Individual clones derived from the shRNA experiment were then transfected with shRNA-resistant ATM, and cells selected with G418 (400 μg/ml). pCMV-CREB, pCMV-CREBS133A, and pCMV-KCREB vectors were obtained from BD Biosciences, and cell lines selected with G418 (450 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation, Western Blot Analysis, Luciferase Assay, and Kinase Assay−Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 500 μm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml leupeptin, 1× phosphatase inhibitor mixture set 1 (Calbiochem). All immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer. For kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2), and incubated in kinase buffer (50 μl) supplemented with 50 μm ATP, p53 peptide (2 μg: EPPLSQEAFADL-WKK), and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated as described by us (14.Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 28.Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol.

SH-SY5Y cells were transiently transfected with CRE-luciferase reporter plasmid (3 μg: Stratagene) using FuGENE 6 (Roche) and allowed to recover for 24 h. Following treatment, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Stratagene, CA). Antibodies used were: ATM antibodies, PC116 (Oncogene Science, CA), 5C2 and 2C1 (Genetex, TX), and Ser(P)-1981 ATM (Rockland Immunochemicals, PA). β-Actin (Cell Signaling), CREB and phospho-CREB (Upstate Biotech, NY), TrkB and VP-16 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) were also used. Immunofluorescence−Cells were seeded onto LabTek II chamber slides (Nunc, NY), fixed in paraformaldehyde (14.Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Slides were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, AL) and visualized with a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000 microscope. Cell Survival Assays−MTT assays were carried out using the CellTiter Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Promega). 5 × 103 cells were exposed to RA (15 μm) for specified time points and then incubated with MTT at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 1.75 h. Absorbance was recorded at 490 nm (using 670 nm as the reference filter) using a Benchmark Plus microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Background absorbance was subtracted. KU-55933 was purchased from Sigma. To evaluate the role of ATM in the signaling pathways required for differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, ATM expression was silenced by stable expression of an ATM-specific shRNA vector (27.Chen S. Wang G. Makrigiorgos G.M. Price B.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Supplementary Fig. 1A demonstrates robust suppression of ATM in multiple individual SH-SY5Y clonal cell lines expressing ATM shRNA. Two of these clones, SA2 and SA6, were selected for further analysis. To control for clonal variation and off-gene regulation by the shRNA, an ATM cDNA construct was engineered to contain silent point mutations in the region targeted by the ATM-specific shRNA. Fig. 1A demonstrates the successful re-expression of the shRNA-resistant ATM in SA2 and SA6 cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 4), although the reintroduced ATM was expressed at slightly lower levels than the endogenous ATM protein (Fig. 1A). Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells containing a nonspecific shRNA (Fig. 1B, shVector) to retinoic acid for 5 days induced growth arrest, followed by the extension of neuritic processes. Subsequent removal of RA and incubation in serum-free media supplemented with BDNF results in elongation of these neuritic outgrowths, forming a complex network of neuritic processes (Fig. 1B), as previously reported (24.Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 29.Miloso M. Villa D. Crimi M. Galbiati S. Donzelli E. Nicolini G. Tredici G. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 75: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In contrast, both SA2 and SA6 cells, in which ATM was silenced, detached from the dish and subsequently underwent cell death when exposed to RA (Fig. 1B). When ATM was re-expressed in the SA2 and SA6 cells (using an shRNA resistant version of the ATM gene), the ability of the cells to differentiate into post-mitotic neuronal-like cells was restored, demonstrating that this phenotype was due to loss of ATM protein rather than a nonspecific effect of the shRNA vector. This effect was quantitated in Fig. 1C, where exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to retinoic acid inhibited cell proliferation, but did not result in detectable changes in cell viability (Fig. 1C). In contrast, SA2 cells exhibited >90% loss of viability following 72 h exposure to retinoic acid (Fig. 1C). However, re-expression of ATM in SA2 cells rescued the cells from retinoic acid-induced cell death (Fig. 1C) and allowed the cells to differentiate. Similar results were seen with SA6 cells (data not shown). These results were further confirmed by treating SH-SY5Y cells with the ATM-specific kinase inhibitor KU-55933 (30.Hickson I. Zhao Y. Richardson C.J. Green S.J. Martin N.M. Orr A.I. Reaper P.M. Jackson S.P. Curtin N.J. Smith G.C. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 9152-9159Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). KU-55933 on its own had no significant impact on SH-SY5Y cell viability (supplementary Fig. 1B). However, combined treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the ATM kinase inhibitor KU-55933 and retinoic acid induced rapid cell death and failure to differentiate (supplementary Fig. 1, B and C). Thus, both pharmacological and genetic inactivation of ATM in retinoic acid-treated SH-SY5Y cells leads to cell death rather than differentiation. Furthermore, the ability of KU-55933 to inhibit the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells indicates that it is the kinase activity of ATM that is essential for this process. A key step in the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells is the RA-dependent up-regulation of growth factor receptors, including RARβ and TrkB, the receptor for BDNF (23.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24.Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J.

Cell. 2006; 17: 566-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Up-regulation of TrkB levels is required for BDNF to induce terminal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells (23.Ruiz-Leon Y. Pascual A. Neuroscience. 2003; 120: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24.Encinas M. Iglesias M. Liu Y. Wang H. Muhaisen A. Cena V. Gallego C. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 991-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). Western analysis demonstrated that RA increased the levels of RARβ and TrkB receptors in both SH-SY5Y and in the ATM-deficient SA2 and SA6 (supplementary Fig. 2A). The inability of SA2 and SA6 cells to differentiate is therefore not due to a failure to up-regulate RA driven transcription of the RARβ and TrkB genes. Overall, Fig. 1 demonstrates a central role for the ATM protein in the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells into post-mitotic neuronal-like cells. The requirement for ATM in RA signaling implies that RA activates the kinase activity of ATM. The up-regulation of the kinase activity of ATM by DNA damage causes autophosphorylation of serine 1981, which can be monitored by immunofluorescence using a phospho-specific antibody to detect autophosphorylation of serine 1981 of ATM (28.Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15158-15164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In Fig. 2B, exposure of ATM negative cells to ionizing radiation (A-T) did not result in phosphorylation of serine 1981 of ATM as detected by immunofluoresence, whereas re-expression of ATM in these cells (A-TATM; described by us in Refs. 14.Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar and 28.Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15158-15164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)) allows detection of autophosphorylated ATM in irradiated, but not control cells. Thus, the phospho-serine 1981 antibody can be used to monitor ATM autophosphorylation in vivo, as shown by other groups (5.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 16.Uziel T. Lerenthal Y. Moyal L. Andegeko Y. Mittelman L. Shiloh Y. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5612-5621Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar, 17.Falck J. Coates J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2005; 434: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Addition of RA to SH-SY5Y cells resulted in rapid ATM autophosphorylation within 15 min of RA addition, and ATM remained autophosphorylated throughout the 5-day exposure to RA (Fig. 2A). Subsequent withdrawal of RA led to loss of ATM autophosphorylation (Fig. 2A) and the cells subsequently underwent cell death (data not shown). However, addition of BDNF (in the absence of RA) maintained ATM in the active, autophosphorylated form (Fig. 2A), and the cells remained in the growth arrested, differentiated state for up to 2 weeks in culture (Fig. 1B). Supplementary Fig. 2B demonstrates that ATM protein levels do not significantly change during the differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, indicating that the increased phosphoserine 1981 autophosphorylation signal is due to ATM autophosphorylation rather than increased ATM protein levels. Fig. 2A therefore demonstrates increased ATM autophosphorylation, implying increased ATM kinase activity is maintained throughout the RA/BDNF-induced differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells. To determine whether RA increased ATM autophosphorylation in other neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-BE (which undergoes retinoic acid-induced differentiation (33.Choi S.Y. Choi B.H. Suh B.C. Chae H.D. Kim J.S. Shin M.J. Kang S.S. Negishi M. Kim K.T. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 303-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) and SK-N-AS (which does not respond to retinoic acid (34.Gaetano C. Matsumoto K. Thiele C.J. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 487-493PubMed Google Scholar)) were examined. RA increased ATM autophosphorylation in differentiation proficient SK-N-BE cells, but not in RA refractive SK-N-AS cells (Fig. 2C). Because ATM is activated in response to DNA damage, it is possible that retinoic acid may induce ATM activation through production of DNA damage. Activation of ATM by DNA damage results in the recruitment of ATM to specific sites of DNA damage, referred to as ionizing radiation-induced foci (5.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Exposure of SH-SY5Y cells to ionizing radiation gives rise to the characteristic punctate Ser(P)-1981 ATM staining pattern (Fig. 2D), corresponding to the recruitment of active ATM to sites of DNA damage (5.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 28.Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15158-15164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, exposure to RA results in a diffuse staining for phosphorylated ATM (Fig. 2D). This diffuse distribution of activated ATM is similar to the pattern observed when ATM is activated by non-DNA damaging agents (such as trichostatin A (5.Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar, 28.Fernandes N. Sun Y. Chen S. Paul P. Shaw R.J. Cantley L.C. Price B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15158-15164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). We interpret this diffuse nuclear ATM staining pattern to indicate that retinoic acid treatment does not activate ATM through generation of DNA damage. Furthermore, we note that the retinoic acid-activated ATM is located exclusively within the nucleus of the cells (Fig. 2, A and D), with minimal signal associated with the cytoplasmic fraction. Fig. 2 therefore demonstrates specific and rapid autophosphorylation of ATM in response to RA. To examine more clearly how RA regulates ATM, we sought to confirm that the increased autophosphorylation of ATM seen in Fig. 2 was due to increased intrinsic ATM kinase activity. In Fig. 3A, cell extracts immunoprecipitated with IgG displayed minimal ATM kinase activity (Fig. 3A). The activity of ATM kinase was increased 2-fold by the radiomimetic agent bleomycin. This 2-fold increase of the kinase activity of ATM in response to DNA damage is similar to that previously reported (14.Sun Y. Jiang X. Chen S. Fernandes N. Price B.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13182-13187Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 35.Chen S. Paul P. Price B.D. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6332-6339Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). When cells were incubated with RA for 20 min, the kinase activity of ATM was increased to the same levels seen following DNA damage (Fig. 3A), consistent with the rapid autophosphorylation of ATM seen in vivo in Fig. 2A. Figs. 2A and 3C therefore demonstrate that the kinase activity of ATM is increased when SH-SY5Y cells are exposed to RA. Retinoids are potent inducers of neuronal differentiation and activate the CREB transcriptional regulatory protein (31.Canon E. Cosgaya J.M. Scsucova S. Aranda A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 5583-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36.Lonze B.E. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 2002; 35: 605-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1757) Google Scholar). CREB plays a key role in cellular differentiation, with a particularly important function in regulating neuronal function, including neuronal survival (37.Mantamadiotis T. Lemberger T. Bleckmann S.C.

The ability of CREB to regulate neuronal survival suggested that ATM may promote differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells through activation of the CREB transcriptional regulator. CREB activation involves the phosphorylation of serine 133 of CREB, which creates a binding site for the CBP hi"

It may exhibit anti- or pro-apoptotic activity depending on the nature of the stimulus. We report here that introducing phosphorylated galectin-3 (P-GAL3) into GAL3-null, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-resistant human breast carcinoma cells promotes TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death by stimulating the phosphorylation/inactivation of the pro-apoptotic molecule Bad resulting in the inhibition of mitochondrial depolarization and the release of cytochrome c. Exposure of the transfectant cells to TRAIL leads to the recruitment of the initiator capase-8 followed by activation of the effector caspase-9, independent of cytochrome c, and subsequently the processing of the executioner caspase-3. P-GAL3 and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were coordinately expressed, with concomitant dephosphorylation of Akt in TRAIL-sensitive cells. In contrast, overexpression of phospho-mutant GAL3 (incapable of phosphorylation) failed to elicit similar responses. Depletion of PTEN using small interference RNAs reinstated Akt phosphorylation and conferred TRAIL resistance. In addition phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors rendered the phospho-mutant GAL3-resistant cells sensitive to TRAIL. These findings suggest a pivotal role for P-GAL3 in promoting TRAIL sensitivity through activation of a nonclassic apoptotic pathway and identify P-GAL3 as a novel regulator of PTEN.

P-GAL3 and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) were coordinately expressed, with concomitant dephosphorylation of Akt in TRAIL-sensitive cells. In contrast, overexpression of phospho-mutant GAL3 (incapable of phosphorylation) failed to elicit similar responses. Depletion of PTEN using small interference RNAs reinstated Akt phosphorylation and conferred TRAIL resistance. In addition phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors rendered the phospho-mutant GAL3-resistant cells sensitive to TRAIL. These findings suggest a pivotal role for P-GAL3 in promoting TRAIL sensitivity through activation of a nonclassic apoptotic pathway and identify P-GAL3 as a novel regulator of PTEN. Galectins are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that have been well conserved through evolution and are abundant in epithelial and immune cells of animals (1Barondes S.H. Castronovo V.

These proteins have sequence similarities in the carbohydrate recognition domain and specificity for β-galactoside moieties found on both N- and O-linked glycans (3Abbott W.M. Hounsell E.F. Feizi T.

Galectins play a significant role in apoptosis, and galectins such as galectin-1 and -9 have been implicated in the promotion of apoptosis of immune and melanoma cells (5Kageshita T. Kashio Y.

Acta. 2002; 1572: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). In contrast, galectin-3 (GAL3) 3The abbreviations used are: GAL3, galectin-3; P-GAL3, phosphorylated galectin-3 at Ser-6; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase dUTP nick end labeling; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; P-GAL3, phosphorylated galectin-3; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, inositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; siRNA, small interference RNA; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone. 3The abbreviations used are: GAL3, galectin-3; P-GAL3, phosphorylated galectin-3 at Ser-6; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; TRAIL, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl-transferase dUTP nick end labeling; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; P-GAL3, phosphorylated galectin-3; DISC, death-inducing signaling complex; FADD, Fas-associated death domain; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PIP2, inositol 1,4,5-bisphosphate; PIP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; cisplatin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; siRNA, small interference RNA; FMK, fluoromethyl ketone. may exert anti- or pro-apoptotic activity depending on the cell type and the nature of the stimulus. For example, GAL3 inhibits Fas-induced T-cell apoptosis (8Nakahara S. Oka N. Raz A. Apoptosis. 2005; 10: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) as well as epithelial cell apoptotic cell death induced by staurosporine, cisplatin, and genistein (9Dumic J. Dabelic S. Flogel M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 616-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Overexpression of GAL3 in breast carcinoma cells inactivates Akt and sensitizes them to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis (10Lee Y.J. Song Y.K. Song J.J. Siervo-Sassi R.R. Kim H.R. Li L. Spitz D.R. Lokshin A. Kim J.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 288: 21-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but renders them resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs (11Akahani S. Nangia-Makker P. Inohara H. Kim H.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5272-5276PubMed Google Scholar, 12Choi J.H. Chun K.H. Raz A. Lotan R. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2004; 3: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, when GAL3 is introduced into bladder carcinoma cells, it activates Akt and confers resistance to TRAIL (13Oka N. Nakahara S. Takenaka Y. Fukumori T. Hogan V. Kanayama H.O. Yanagawa T. Raz A. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7546-7553Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which GAL3 regulates apoptosis are not fully understood. A portion of its anti-apoptotic activity may be attributed to the anti-death motif (NEGR) that is conserved in the BH1 domain of the Bcl-2 family (11Akahani S. Nangia-Makker P. Inohara H. Kim H.R. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5272-5276PubMed Google Scholar). In a manner similar to Bcl-2, phosphorylation may play an important role in controlling the anti-apoptotic function of GAL3 (14Yoshii T. Fukumori T. Honjo Y. Inohara H. Kim H.R. Raz A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6852-6857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). GAL3 undergoes phosphorylation at Ser-6 by casein kinase1 (15Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and in response to an apoptotic insult P-GAL3 is exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it maintains mitochondrial homeostasis and blocks cytochrome c release (17Takenaka Y. Fukumori T. Yoshii T. Oka N. Inohara H. Kim H.R. Bresalier R.S. Raz A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4395-4406Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). TRAIL, a member of the tumor necrosis factor family, transmits death signals through death domain-containing receptors (18Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5085) Google Scholar). The death signal triggered by TRAIL can be classified into two categories. In the first category, the signal is independent of mitochondrial activation and cannot be blocked by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (19Suliman A. Lam A. Datta R. Srivastava R.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2122-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). In this pathway, TRAIL initiates signaling via the formation of a death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) that recruits and activates pro-caspase-8. Activated caspase-8 then processes directly the executioner caspase-3 (20Thorburn A. Cell Signal. 2004; 16: 139-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the second category, the signal requires activation of effector caspase-9 by the mitochondria and can be blocked by Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL (21Hinz S. Trauzold A. Boenicke L. Sandberg C. Beckmann S. Bayer E. Walczak H. Kalthoff H. Ungefroren H. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5477-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In this pathway, activation of caspase-8 results in Bid cleavage and subsequent mitochondrial depolarization and release of apoptogenic factors (22Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar). One such factor, cytochrome c, binds Apaf1 and promotes oligomerization and recruitment of apical caspase-9 into a high molecular weight complex termed the apoptosome. Assembly of the apoptosome induces processing of caspase-9 and subsequent activation of caspase-3 (23Ho A.T. Li Q.H. Hakem R. Mak T.W. Zacksenhaus E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 460-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition to its direct apoptosis-inducing effect, TRAIL also plays an important role in immune surveillance against tumor initiation, development, and metastasis, suggesting a potential application to cancer therapy (24Cretney E. Takeda K. Yagita H. Glaccum M. Peschon J.J. Smyth M.J. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 1356-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 25Takeda K. Hayakawa Y. Smyth M.J. Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Kakuta S. Iwakura Y. Yagita H. Okumura K. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Resistance to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells may, however, limit the successes of TRAIL therapy. Resistance to TRAIL can occur at different points in the signaling pathways triggered by TRAIL-induced apoptosis such as dysfunction of the death receptors DR4 and DR5 (26Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee S.H. Park W.S. Kim S.Y. Park J.Y. Lee J.H. Lee S.K. Lee S.N. Jung S.S. Han J.Y. Kim H. Lee J.Y. Yoo N.J. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4942-4946PubMed Google Scholar), defects in the Fas-associated death domain (FADD) (27Kuang A.A. Diehl G.E. Zhang J. Winoto A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25065-25068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and caspase-8 (28Fulda S. Kufer M.U. Meyer E. van Valen F. Dockhorn-Dworniczak B. Debatin K.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5865-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), and activation of the survival PI3K/Akt pathway (29Larribere L. Khaled M. Tartare-Deckert S. Busca R. Luciano F. Bille K. Valony G. Eychene A. Auberger P. Ortonne J.P. Ballotti R. Bertolotto C. Cell Death Differ. 2004; 11: 1084-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The mechanisms of acquired TRAIL resistance in most cancer cell types are largely unknown. Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that has potent anti-apoptotic effects by directly phosphorylating and inactivating proteins involved in apoptosis, including GSK-3, Bad, Forkhead, and procaspase-9 (30Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5333) Google Scholar, 31Downward J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1 (-E35): E33Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Because its activation promotes cell survival, sustained up-regulation of Akt activity has been reported to contribute to development of cancers such as breast, ovarian, prostate, and gastric adenocarcinomas (32Vivanco I. Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5049) Google Scholar). Activation of Akt by growth factors and cytokine treatment generally occurs via the PI3K pathway. Growth factor treatment leads to the recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane, where it catalyzes the conversion of PIP2 to PIP3 (33Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The accumulation of PIP3 creates docking sites for Akt, which binds PIP3 via its pleckstrin homology domain. Another kinase that is recruited to the plasma membrane by the same phospholipids is phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1, which phosphorylates Akt at Thr-308. Full activation of Akt requires its phosphorylation at a second site, Ser-473 (34Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). Although activation of PI3K leads to the generation of PIP3, this can be counterbalanced by the action of phosphatase and tension homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) phosphatase. PTEN is a dual phosphatase that mainly dephosphorylates PIP3. Because PI3K catalyzes the production of PIP3, PTEN antagonizes this PI3K function and negatively regulates Akt activities (35Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Loss of PTEN function or expression increases the concentration of PIP3 and induces Akt hyperactivation, which leads to the protection of cells from various apoptotic stimuli (36Sun H. Lesche R. Li D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N. Mueller B. Liu X. Wu H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6199-6204Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In contrast, overproduction of PTEN induces growth suppression via cell cycle arrest and/or induction of apoptosis (37Stambolic V. Suzuki A. de la Pompa J.L. Brothers G.M. Mirtsos C. Sasaki T. Ruland J. Penninger J.M. Siderovski D.P. Mak T.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2081) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious importance of PTEN, only a handful of molecules are known to control its expression. Intracellular molecules reported to regulate PTEN transcription include p53 (38Stambolic V.

In this study, we examined the role of P-GAL3 in the acquisition of TRAIL sensitivity by breast carcinoma cells and sought to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying P-GAL3-mediated TRAIL signaling. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human breast carcinoma BT549 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml) in a 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The establishment of a stable neoresistant control vector-transfected BT549 clone (BT549/V), two wild-type galectin-3-transfected BT549 clones (gal25A and gal25B), and two phospho-mutant galectin-3 BT549 transfectant clones (SA7 and SA9) was previously described (41Mazurek N. Sun Y.J. Price J.E. Ramdas L. Schober W. Nangia-Makker P. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10767-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Galectin-3 is phosphorylated at Ser-6 (15Huflejt M.E. Turck C.W. Lindstedt R. Barondes S.H. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26712-26718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mazurek N.

Ser-6 → Ala mutation results in the inability of GAL3 to be phosphorylated at this site, retention of carbohydrate binding (normally lost with phosphorylation) (16Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and loss of tumorigenicity (41Mazurek N. Sun Y.J. Price J.E. Ramdas L. Schober W. Nangia-Makker P. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10767-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser to Glu mimics constitutive Ser phosphorylation in certain proteins. In contrast, however, it has been demonstrated that Ser → Glu mutation in GAL3 mimics dephosphorylated Ser rather than phosphorylated Ser. Cells expressing the Ser → Glu mutation retain carbohydrate binding, are not tumorigenic and are resistant to cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (cisplatin), mimicking dephosphorylated GAL3 in vitro and in vivo (14Yoshii T.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10767-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, phospho-mutant galectin-3 was generated by substitution of the Ser-6 residue by alanine (SA clones) only using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (41Mazurek N. Sun Y.J. Price J.E. Ramdas L. Schober W. Nangia-Makker P. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10767-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The stable transfected clones were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing G418 (200 μg/ml). Lysates from five additional breast cancer cell lines (BT474, BT20, T47D, Du4475, and SKBR3) were obtained from Dr. Janet E. Price, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked in flow cytometry buffers (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were double stained with a 1:100 dilution of rat anti-GAL3 monoclonal antibody (TIB166, 0.26 mg/ml, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and a 1:500 dilution of rabbit anti-P-GAL (Ser-6, 0.88 mg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-P-GAL3 antibody was established in conjunction with Zymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA) by immunizing rabbits against a synthetic phosphopeptide comprising of 14 N-terminal amino acids of galectin-3 phosphorylated at Ser-6 (DNF(pS)LHDALSGSGN(C)). The antibody was affinity-purified on an immobilized “hot” peptide followed by affinity absorption on an immobilized “cold” peptide. The specificity of the antibody was determined by a differential enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using hot and cold peptides. Western blot analysis of human recombinant GAL3 and phosphorylated protein (produced, purified, and phosphorylated by casein kinase 1 (obtained from New England Biolabs) as previously described (16Mazurek N. Conklin J. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36311-36315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar)) further confirmed specificity of the antibody for P-GAL3 (supplemental Fig. S1a). Secondary antibodies used were as follows. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), and phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were added at 1:200 dilution and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. (Nuclei were stained with ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Invitrogen). Expression and localization of the proteins were observed under a confocal microscope system (Olympus FV500, Olympus America, Melville, NY) and analyzed by CellQuest PRO software (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ) at the Flow Cytometry and Image Analysis Core of The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center.) Western Blotting—Total cell lysate extractions from cells treated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 2 h with or without exposure to LY294002 or wortmannin (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) and Western blots were performed as previously described (41Mazurek N. Sun Y.J. Price J.E. Ramdas L. Schober W. Nangia-Makker P. Byrd J.C. Raz A. Bresalier R.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 10767-10775Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using a Dc protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-galectin-3, anti-P-GAL3, anti-death receptors DR4 and DR5, or anti-FLIP (R&D Systems); anti-adaptor proteins FADD and FAF1; anti-caspase-3 (full-length and cleaved fragments), anti-caspase-8 (full-length procaspase-8 as well as the cleaved intermediate and the active subunit), caspase-9 (pro-caspase-9 as well as cleaved fragments), anti-members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family (C-IAP1, X1AP, and survivin); anti-Akt and phosphorylated Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308; anti-PTEN; anti-ERK and phosphorylated ERK; and anti-Bad and phosphorylated Bad at Ser-112 and Ser-136 (Cell Signaling). Anti-β-actin (Sigma) was used to monitor equal loading in each lane. Immunoreactivity was detected by sequential incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For densitometric analysis of Western blots, Alpha Image (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) was used. Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Assays—Cells viability was assessed by the MTT (3-(4; 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazoluim bromide, Sigma) assay (Sigma). The cells (10,000/well) were seeded into 96-μl plates and grown overnight after treatment with either TRAIL or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α, R&D Systems) with a combination of cycloheximide (Sigma) or Fas ligand (Kamiya Biomedical, Seattle, WA). MTT solution was added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 3 h at 37 °C, followed by 200 μl of Me2SO (Fisher Biotech, Fairlawn, NY). Colorimetric reading at 570 mm was performed using an MRX Revelation microplate reader (Dynex, Chantilly, VA). The results are expressed as mean cytotoxicity ± S.D. from triplicate cultures. Determinations were made in triplicate. Apoptosis was assessed by PARP degradation and quantified by using the TUNEL assay. PARP degradation was determined by Western blot using an anti-PARP antibody capable of detecting full-length PARP as well as fragments of cleaved PARP. The TUNEL assay was performed using an apoptosis detection kit (APO-DIRECT, BD Biosciences). In each experiment, 1 × 106 cells were processed for flow cytometric analysis on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed by CellQuest PRO software (BD Biosciences). Caspase Activity and Caspase Inhibition Analyses—Activation of caspases 8, 9, and 3 was assessed by Western blot analysis with anti caspase-8, -9, and -3 antibodies capable of detecting the full-length pro-caspases and the cleaved intermediate fragments and active subunits of caspases 8, 9, and 3. In vitro activity of caspases 8, 9, and 3 was quantified with the APO Alert caspase assay plates (BD Biosciences) using a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA) with 380 nm excitation and 460 mm emission. Cell-permeable, nonreversible caspase-8 and -9 inhibitors were incubated with 100 ng/ml TRAIL for 2 h, and apoptosis was analyzed by PARP degradation and MTT assay. Mitochondrial Energization—Changes in the mitochondrial membrane potential were detected by MitoTracker Red CMXRos dye (Molecular Probes). For this experiment, 1 × 106 cells were treated with 0.3 μm of the membrane potential-dependent CMXRos dye in combination with 1 μm of the membrane potential independent MitoTracker Green (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37 °C and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The dual labeling was analyzed by CellQuest Pro software. Single color-stained cells were used for instrument compensations. Detection of Cytochrome c Release from Mitochondria—The release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of untreated and TRAIL-treated cells was determined in floating and attached cells combined using the APO Alert Cell Fractionation kit (Invitrogen). The quality of the separation of the mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions was determined by anti-COX4 antibody, and the location of cytochrome c was detected by Western blot using an anti-cytochrome c antibody. Real-time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from parental BT549 cells and galectin-3 transfectants by the TRIzol method (Invitrogen) and further purified using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Initial experiments were performed to determine the valid range of RNA concentrations and to demonstrate the similarity of PCR efficiencies compared with the endogenous control gene cyclophilin. To determine -fold changes, real-time reverse transcription-PCR was performed on the ABI Prism 7900 using the commercially available gene expression assay for PTEN and the cyclophilin Vic labeled Pre-Developed Assay Reagent (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) without multiplexing. A 50-μl final reaction volume containing 1× TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix without AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems), 1× Multiscribe with RNase Inhibitors, and 1× gene expression assay was used to amplify 50 ng of total RNA with the following cycling conditions: 30 min at 48 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, then 50 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. The 7900 Sequence Detection System 2.2 software automatically determined the -fold change for each gene in each sample relative to the BD Biosciences Human Reference Pool using the δδCt method. Calculations were performed for the PTEN gene in transfectants relative to parental BT549 cells. PTEN Luciferase Reporter Assay—A PTEN promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid was kindly provided by Yufang Tang and Charis Eng (42Tang Y. Eng C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 736-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) of The Ohio State University. β-Galactoside expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences) was used to normalize for transfection efficiency. For transient transfection, cells were seeded at a concentration of 8 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After overnight culture, the cells in each well were cotransfected with 0.2 μg of PTEN-luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pCH110 using 3 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were cultured for an additional 48 h and harvested for measurement of luciferase activity in relative light units and normalized to β-galactosidase, using the Promega luciferase assay system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) with a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Values shown represent the mean and standard deviation of at least three replicate determinations. To examine whether GAL3 overexpression augments transcriptional activity of the PTEN promoter, BT549 parental cells were transiently transfected with various amounts of PBK-CMV-GAL3 (14Yoshii T.

After 48 h, the cells were lysed, and activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) as described above.

Asp-120 is fully conserved in all metallo-β-lactamases and is central to catalysis. Several roles have been proposed for Asp-120, but so far there is no agreed consensus. We generated four site-specifically substituted variants of the enzyme BcII from Bacillus cereus as follows: D120N, D120E, D120Q, and D120S. Replacement of Asp-120 by other residues with very different metal ligating capabilities severely impairs the lactamase activity without abolishing metal binding to the mutated site. A kinetic study of these mutants indicates that Asp-120 is not the proton donor, nor does it play an essential role in nucleophilic activation. Spectroscopic and crystallographic analysis of D120S BcII, the least active mutant bearing the weakest metal ligand in the series, reveals that this enzyme is able to accommodate a dinuclear center and that perturbations in the active site are limited to the Zn2 site. It is proposed that the role of Asp-120 is to act as a strong Zn2 ligand, locating this ion optimally for substrate binding, stabilization of the development of a partial negative charge in the β-lactam nitrogen, and protonation of this atom by a zinc-bound water molecule.

Meroueh S.O. Mobashery S. Chem. Rev. 2005; 105: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 2Wilke M.S. Lovering A.L. Strynadka N.C. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These enzymes are capable of catalyzing the scission of the amide bond of the β-lactam ring characteristic of this class of antibiotics, rendering them ineffective toward their targets. They can be broadly divided into serine-β-lactamases and metallo-β-lactamases, based on their active sites and catalytic mechanisms. β-Lactam hydrolysis takes place by a nucleophilic attack to the carbonyl group, and a subsequent C-N cleavage, usually aided by protonation of the bridging nitrogen atom (3Page M.I. Laws A.P. J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 1998; 1998: 1609-1617Crossref Scopus (142) Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). In the case of serine-β-lactamases, the reaction proceeds through formation of a covalent intermediate with the nucleophilic Ser-70 (4Strynadka N.C. Adachi H. Jensen S.E. Johns K. Sielecki A. Betzel C. Sutoh K. James M.N. Nature. 1992; 359: 700-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Based on this mechanistic feature, clinically useful inhibitors for serine-β-lactamases have been designed, such as clavulanic acid and tazobactam, that give rise to irreversible inhibition by formation of a covalent adduct with the enzyme (5Sulton D. Pagan-Roderiguez D. Zhou X. Liu Y. Hujer A.M. Bethel C.R. Helfand M.S. Thomson J.M. Anderson V.E. Buynak J.D. Ng L.M. Bonomo R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 35528-35536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In contrast, MβL 4The abbreviations used are: MβL, metallo-β-lactamase; SKIE, solvent kinetic isotope effect; CT, charge transfer; WT, wild type. -mediated catalysis does not proceed through such an intermediate, thus rendering these inhibitors ineffective (6Crowder M.W. Spencer J. Vila A.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2006; 39: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The spread of plasmid-encoded MβL genes among opportunistic and pathogenic bacteria, together with the lack of clinically useful inhibitors, is becoming a serious and yet unsolved clinical problem (7Walsh T.R. Toleman M.A. Poirel L. Nordmann P. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 306-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The elucidation of the catalytic mechanisms employed by MβLs to hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics is a prerequisite for rational inhibitor design. The activity of MβLs is dependent on the presence of either one or two Zn(II) ions in their active sites. MβLs have been classified into three subgroups (B1, B2, and B3), based on amino acid sequence similarity, substrate profile, and structural properties (8Garau G. Di Guilmi A.M. Hall B.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2005; 49: 2778-2784Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The diversity of these subgroups, exemplified by the vastly different efficacies of nonclinical inhibitors toward MβLs, led to the prediction that finding a single inhibitor for all metallo-β-lactamases may not be possible. The search for any common mechanistic feature of MβLs is therefore a high priority. The first crystal structure solved for an MβL was that of BcII from Bacillus cereus, which revealed one Zn(II) ion bound to three His residues (His-116, His-118, and His-196) and a H2O molecule, in the so-called Zn1 or 3H site (9Carfi A. Pares S. Duee E. Galleni M. Duez C. Frère J.M. Dideberg O. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4914-4921Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Subsequent structures of BcII (10Fabiane S.M. Sohi M.K. Wan T.

An analogous binding site in B3 enzymes is provided by Asp-120, His-121, and His-263 (DHH site) (14Garcia-Saez I. Mercuri P.S. Papamicael C. Kahn R. Frere J.M. Galleni M. Rossolini G.M. Dideberg O.

Biol. 1998; 284: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). B2 enzymes, however, are active as mononuclear enzymes, with the only Zn(II) ion located in the DCH site (16Garau G. Bebrone C. Anne C. Galleni M. Frere J.M. Dideberg O. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345: 785-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Despite these differences, Asp-120 is fully conserved in all metallo-β-lactamases identified so far. Substitution of Asp-120 in B1 and B3 MβLs have shown that this residue is central to catalysis (17Seny D. Prosperi-Meys C. Bebrone C. Rossolini G.M. Page M.I. Noel P. Frere J.M. Galleni M. Biochem.

The involvement of Asp-120 in catalysis as a nucleophile was initially ruled out by Bounaga et al. (21Bounaga S. Laws A.P. Galleni M. Page M.I. Biochem. J. 1998; 31: 703-711Crossref Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and Wang et al. (22Wang Z. Fast W. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10013-10023Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Since then, the following have been proposed: 1) Asp-120 is the proton donor in the rate-determining step of β-lactam hydrolysis (17Seny D. Prosperi-Meys C. Bebrone C. Rossolini G.M. Page M.I.

Despite all the efforts aimed at determining the role of Asp-120 in the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics, there is no agreed consensus. To provide further evidence regarding the role of Asp-120, we generated four site-specifically substituted variants of the enzyme BcII from B. cereus. Asp-120 was replaced by an asparagine, a glutamic acid, a glutamine, and a serine to create the BcII mutant proteins D120N, D120E, D120Q, and D120S, respectively. Based on a series of biochemical, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies, here we propose that the principal role of Asp-120 in MβLs is defining the position of the Zn2 ion, which is crucial for stabilizing the development of a negative charge on the β-lactam nitrogen atom, providing the water molecule that protonates this nitrogen, and binding the substrate. All chemicals were of the highest quality available. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS′ cells (Stratagene, CA) were employed for protein production. E. coli JM109 cells (Stratagene, CA) were employed for transformation with plasmid DNA and ligation mixtures. Luria-Bertani medium (Sigma) was used as growth media for all bacterial strains. DNA preparation and related techniques were performed according to standard protocols (29Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Plus SV minipreps kit (Promega). DNA was extracted from agarose gels using QIAEX II kit (Qiagen) or GFX columns (Amersham Biosciences). A preparation of pETβLII plasmid DNA (30Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was digested with BamHI and PstI and subcloned into a vector pBluescript II KS(–) previously digested with the same restriction endonucleases, to obtain the plasmid KS-NH3, which contains the DNA fragment coding for the NH3-terminal half of BcII (31Cricco J.A. Role of a Cys Residue in the Structure and Function of Metallo-beta-Lactamases, University of Rosario, Rosario, Argentina2002Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as the DNA template for the PCR-based mutagenesis protocol. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the megaprimer PCR protocol (32Barik S. Trower M.K. Site-directed Mutagenesis in Vitro by Megaprimer PCR. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 203-216Google Scholar). The first PCR was carried out using the plasmid KS-NH3 as the template DNA, the ks-reverse primer (5′-TCACACAggAAACAgCTATgAC-3′), and the corresponding mutagenic primer: D120_N_SphI (5′-CACATgCgCATgCTAATCgAATTggCgg-3′) for D120N, D120_S_SphI (5′-CACATgCgCATgCTAgTCgAATTggCgg-3′) for D120S, D120_E_SphI (5′-CACATgCgCATgCTgAACgAATTggCgg-3′) for D120E, and D120_Q_SphI (5′-CACATgCgCATgCTCAACgAATTggCgg-3′) for D120Q. The mutagenic primers were designed to introduce a recognition site for the restriction endonuclease SphI, through the introduction of a silent mutation, using the software Primer Tailoring (33Llarrull L.I. Calcaterra N.B. Biocell. 2001; 25: 62Google Scholar). Boldface underlined letters indicate the silent mutation, and boldface italic underlined letters indicate the nonsilent mutations. A 100-μl reaction mixture, containing 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.5 pmol/μl of each primer, 1 mm MgSO4, 100 ng of template DNA (KS-NH3), 10 μl of the 10× buffer provided with the polymerase (New England Biolabs), and 2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), was used in the PCR, using a GeneAmp® PCR System 2400 equipment (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following cycles were employed in the first PCR: 1) 1 cycle of 3 min at 94 °C; 2) pause for the addition of the DNA polymerase; 3) 30 cycles of 2 min at 94 °C, 3 min at 48 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 4) 1 cycle of 3 min at 72 °C. The PCR mixture was resolved in a 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide, and the 210-bp PCR product (the megaprimer) was recovered from the excised agarose fragment using the QIAEX II kit (Qiagen). The second PCR was carried out using the same template DNA, the megaprimer that codes for the desired mutation, and the ks-forward primer (5′-CgCCAgggTTTTCCCAgTCACgAC-3′). All the megaprimer recovered from the first PCR was used in the second round of amplification, in a 50-μl reaction mixture, containing 0.2 mm of each dNTP, 0.5 pmol/μl of the ks-forward primer, 1 mm MgSO4, 100 ng of template DNA (KS-NH3), 5 μl of the 10× buffer provided with the polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.), and 1.2 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.). The following cycles were employed in the second PCR: 1) 1 cycle of 5 min at 94 °C; 2) pause for the addition of the DNA polymerase; 3) 35 cycles of 2 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 55 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C; and 4) 1 cycle of 4 min at 72 °C. The amplification was corroborated by gel electrophoresis, and the 579-bp purified PCR product was digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and PstI and cloned into pBluescript II KS(–), previously digested with the same endonucleases. After transformation of E. coli JM109 cells with the ligation mixture, the presence of the mutated DNA sequences in the plasmid DNA preparations from selected clones was first corroborated by digestion of the DNA with the restriction endonuclease SphI, whose recognition site was introduced by the mutagenic primers. Afterward, the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (University of Maine Sequencing Facility). The genes that code for the Asp-120 mutants of the metallo-β-lactamase BcII were reconstructed by cloning the DNA fragment coding for the mutagenized NH3-half of BcII, digested with the enzymes BamHI and PstI, and the DNA fragment coding for the wild-type COOH-half of BcII, digested with PstI and HindIII, into the plasmid pET-TERM (31Cricco J.A. Role of a Cys Residue in the Structure and Function of Metallo-beta-Lactamases, University of Rosario, Rosario, Argentina2002Google Scholar) previously digested with the restriction endonucleases BamHI and HindIII. The expression vector pET-TERM allows expression of the protein of interest as an amino-terminal fusion to the enzyme glutathione S-transferase from Schistosoma japonicum, under control of the T7 promoter, and presents the termination sequence from the BcII gene. The DNA fragment that codes for the COOH-terminal half of BcII was purified, after digestion with PstI and HindIII, from the plasmid KS-CT2 (31Cricco J.A. Role of a Cys Residue in the Structure and Function of Metallo-beta-Lactamases, University of Rosario, Rosario, Argentina2002Google Scholar). Wild-type BcII and Asp-120 mutants were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS′ cells as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase, purified, and quantified as follows. Typically, the cell pellet obtained from 50 ml of a saturated culture in LB medium, supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, was resuspended in fresh medium and used to inoculate 1-liter of LB medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml ampicillin and 35 μg/ml chloramphenicol, in a 5-liter Erlenmeyer flask. Cells were grown for 2 h at 37 °C until the A600 = 1 was reached. The expression of fusion protein was induced by addition of 10 g of lactose, and the culture was further incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4-h period. All subsequent purification steps were performed at 4 °C. E. coli cells were lysed by sonication in lysis buffer (16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7, with 3.3 μg/ml DNase, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and cell debris was separated by ultracentrifugation. The GST-BcII fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using a glutathione-Sepharose resin (Amersham Biosciences) as reported previously (30Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The pure fractions were treated with bovine plasma thrombin (Sigma) at a 1:100 ratio in 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2 at 26 °C during 2 h. BcII was purified from the proteolysis mixture by ion-exchange chromatography on Sephadex CM-50 (Amersham Biosciences) as reported previously (30Orellano E.G. Girardini J.E. Cricco J.A. Ceccarelli E.A. Vila A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10173-10180Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Protein samples were dialyzed against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. Purity of the enzyme preparations was checked by SDS-PAGE. Protein concentration was measured spectrophotometrically using ϵ280 = 30,500 m–1·cm–1 (34Paul-Soto R. Bauer R. Frère J.M. Galleni M. Meyer-Klaucke W. Nolting H. Rossolini G.M. de Seny D. Hernández Valladares M. Zeppezauer M. Adolph H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13242-13249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The metal content in the samples of wild-type BcII and Asp-120 mutants was determined under denaturing conditions using the colorimetric metal chelator 4-(2-pyridylazo)resorcinol, as described by Fast et al. (35Fast W. Wang Z. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of different β-lactam antibiotics catalyzed by wild-type BcII and Asp-120 mutants under steady-state conditions were obtained by determination of the initial rate of reaction at different substrate concentrations. Substrate concentrations were calculated based on the following molar absorptivities: penicillin G, Δϵ235 = –775 m–1·cm–1; cefotaxime, Δϵ260 = –7,500 m–1·cm–1; nitrocefin, Δϵ485 = 17,420 m–1·cm–1; imipenem, Δϵ300 = –9,000 m–1·cm–1. The plots of the dependence of the initial rates on substrate concentration were fitted to the Michaelis and Menten equation, using SigmaPlot 8.0. Reactions were carried out in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C. Absorbance changes upon substrate hydrolysis were measured in a Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer, and the temperature was kept constant by means of a Polyscience digital circulator connected to the cell holder in the spectrophotometer. The kinetic parameters obtained for the hydrolysis of different β-lactam antibiotics catalyzed by wild-type BcII and Asp-120 mutants in H2O, under steady-state conditions, were compared with the kinetic parameters obtained for the same reaction carried out in D2O. The initial rate of hydrolysis at different substrate concentrations was measured in 10 mm HEPES, pD 7.5 (pH 7.1), 200 mm NaCl, 20 μm ZnSO4, and 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 30 °C. The dependence of the initial rates on substrate concentration was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, using SigmaPlot 8.0. The deuterated reaction medium was kept at 30 °C under a N2 gas atmosphere, prior to reaction. The hydrolysis of the antibiotics was registered in open cells, during less than 5 min, to avoid a significant water uptake from the environment. All buffer solutions used to prepare the apoenzymes were treated by extensive stirring with Chelex 100 (Sigma). Apoprotein samples were prepared by dialysis of the purified holoprotein (∼200 μm) against two changes of >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm EDTA over a 12-h period under stirring (36Paul-Soto R.

EDTA was removed from the resulting apoenzyme solution by three dialysis steps against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, Chelex 100, and three dialysis steps against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, Chelex 100 (36Paul-Soto R.

For the preparation of apoprotein samples used in EPR experiments, the three last dialysis steps were replaced by one dialysis step against >100 volumes of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, Chelex 100 and finally two dialysis steps against >100 volumes of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, Chelex 100. All dialysis steps were carried out at 4 °C. A solution of 200–300 μm apoprotein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl was titrated with a 10.6 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. For the UV-visible titration, which was done in parallel with the EPR titration, a solution of 1.2 mm apo-BcII D120S in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl was titrated with a 6 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl. The equivalents of bound Co(II) were calculated as the ratio between the concentration of Co(II) in the sample and the concentration of protein capable of binding metal, which was calculated by multiplying the concentration of protein determined by absorbance at 280 nm by the factor n/2, where n is the Zn(II) content of the purified proteins. The spectra were recorded at room temperature in a UV-visible Jasco V-550 spectrophotometer, and difference spectra were obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the corresponding apoprotein. EPR spectroscopy was performed at 13 K, 2 milliwatts, and 9.63 GHz (Bmicrowave ⊥ Bstatic) using a Bruker Elexsys E500 spectrometer equipped with an ER 4116 DM TE012/TE102 dual mode X-band cavity and an Oxford Instruments ESR-900 helium flow cryostat. The apoprotein (1.2 mm), in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.2 m NaCl, was titrated stepwise with a 6 mm CoSO4 stock solution prepared in the same buffer. The Co(II)-containing solution was rapidly mixed with the sample in the EPR tube by manual flicking (37Bennett B. Benson N. McEwan A.G. Bray R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. EPR samples for successive additions of Co(II) were quickly thawed (∼5 s) from 77 to 293 K by agitating the sample tube in water. Crystallization and Data Collection—D120S was crystallized using the vapor diffusion method. 1 μl of the protein solution, at 4.7 mg/ml, was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution, containing 17–19% PEG-3350, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 5.0–5.5, 0.1 m sodium tartrate. Large single crystals grew within a few weeks. These were transferred to a solution supplemented with 25% glycerol and cryocooled by plunging them into liquid nitrogen. The crystals diffract to 1.95 Å resolution, and a data set was collected at CCLRC Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source, station 14.2, at a wavelength of 0.9853Å. The space group was C2, with unit cell parameters a = 53.39 Å, b = 61.97Å, c = 69.57Å, and β = 93.28°. The data were reduced and scaled using MOSFLM (38Leslie A.G.W.

The crystal structure of the wild-type BcII (Protein Data Bank code 3BC2) was used as a search model, stripped of all nonconvalently bound atoms. One clear solution was found, and rigid body refinement yielded R-factor of 30.9% and Rfree was 31.6%. The structure was refined using CNS during two rounds, and finished using Refmac5 from the CCP4 package. Model building was performed using Quanta (Accelrys) and Coot (41Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23864) Google Scholar). The TLS groups were chosen using TLSMD (42Painter J. Merritt E.A. Acta Crystallogr.

It was clear that some of the noncovalently bound atoms (including the Zn(II) ion in position Zn2) were not fully occupied. At 1.95 Å resolution, it was not possible to refine their occupancy and temperature factor simultaneously, and so their occupancies were fixed at 0.5. The final model contains 218 residues, two zinc ions, four glycerol molecules, and 283 waters. Asp-84, as is the case in other structures of the same protein, is in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran plot. The geometry of the model is good as checked by SFCHECK (44Vaguine A.A.

https://openalex.org/W1972222800,"Rhizobium etli CE3 bacteroids were isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris root nodules. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bacteroids was purified and compared with the LPS from laboratory-cultured R. etli CE3 and from cultures grown in the presence of anthocyanin. Comparisons were made of the O-chain polysaccharide, the core oligosaccharide, and the lipid A. Although LPS from CE3 bacteria and bacteroids are structurally similar, it was found that bacteroid LPS had specific modifications to both the O-chain polysaccharide and lipid A portions of their LPS. Cultures grown with anthocyanin contained modifications only to the O-chain polysaccharide. The changes to the O-chain polysaccharide consisted of the addition of a single methyl group to the 2-position of a fucosyl residue in one of the five O-chain trisaccharide repeat units. This same change occurred for bacteria grown in the presence of anthocyanin. This methylation change correlated with the inability of bacteroid LPS and LPS from anthocyanin-containing cultures to bind the monoclonal antibody JIM28. The core oligosaccharide region of bacteroid LPS and from anthocyanin-grown cultures was identical to that of LPS from normal laboratory-cultured CE3. The lipid A from bacteroids consisted exclusively of a tetraacylated species compared with the presence of both tetra- and pentaacylated lipid A from laboratory cultures. Growth in the presence of anthocyanin did not affect the lipid A structure. Purified bacteroids that could resume growth were also found to be more sensitive to the cationic peptides, poly-l-lysine, polymyxin-B, and melittin. Rhizobium etli CE3 bacteroids were isolated from Phaseolus vulgaris root nodules. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bacteroids was purified and compared with the LPS from laboratory-cultured R. etli CE3 and from cultures grown in the presence of anthocyanin.

Root nodule development is orchestrated by a symbiotic molecular dialogue between Gram-negative Rhizobium bacteria (e.g. Azorhizobium sp., Bradyrhizobium sp., Rhizobium sp., Sinorhizobium sp.) and specific legume host plants. Nodules are newly formed organs consisting of plant cells occupied with bacteroids that provide the host plant with fixed nitrogen. In the best studied symbiotic interactions, bacteria enter the roots via susceptible curled root hairs, and intracellular infection threads guide the bacteria toward de novo nodule primordia, where internalization into plant cells takes place. Initiation of nodule development and invasion require the production of bacterial signal molecules, including fatty acylated chitin oligosaccharides known as Nod factors (1D'Haeze W. Holsters M. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: R79-R105Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and structurally complex surface polysaccharides (SPS) 3The abbreviations used are: SPS, surface polysaccharide; AGC, aeroponic growth chamber; CPS, capsular polysaccharide; DOC, deoxycholate; EPS, extracellular polysaccharide; GC-MS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; HPAEC, high performance anion exchange chromatography; Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight; NBT, nitro blue tetrazolium; PMAA, partially methylated alditol acetates; PM, peribacteroid membrane. (2Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Crossref Google Scholar, 3Fraysse N. Couderc F. Poinsot V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1365-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The outer surface of rhizobia typically consists of SPS that include extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) that are released into the media, capsular polysaccharides that are tightly associated with the bacterial surface, and lipopolysaccharides (LPS) that are anchored in the outer membrane (4Noel K.D. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 341-357Google Scholar). LPS are composed of lipid A, a core oligosaccharide, and an O-antigen polysaccharide. Accumulating data demonstrate the important role that rhizobial SPS play in invasion and nodule development and their involvement in the initiation of infection and invasion, suppression of plant defense, bacterial release from infection threads, bacteroid development and senescence, induction of plant gene expression, and protection against antimicrobial compounds (2Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Crossref Google Scholar, 3Fraysse N. Couderc F. Poinsot V. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 1365-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Various observations suggest that proper LPS synthesis is required for invasion and nodule development in various symbiotic interactions, including the interaction between Rhizobium etli and Phaseolus vulgaris (2Kannenberg E.L. Reuhs B.L. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. Spaink H.P. Kondorosi A. Hooykaas P.J. The Rhizobiaceae. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, Boston, London1998: 119-154Crossref Google Scholar, 4Noel K.D. Verma D.P.S. Molecular Signals in Plant-Microbe Communications. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 341-357Google Scholar). An R. etli mutant that lacks the O-chain polysaccharide portion of its LPS elicited the formation of infection threads on P. vulgaris; however, the bacteria ceased to develop within the root hair that formed thick walls (5Cava J.R. Elias P.M. Turowski D.A. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 8-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Noel K.D. VandenBosch K.A. Kulpaca B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The formation of nodule primordia was normal, but no bacteria were released from infection threads and internalized into plant cells (6Noel K.D. VandenBosch K.A. Kulpaca B. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 1392-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Occasionally, some bacteria were present in intercellular spaces. It was furthermore demonstrated that not only the presence of the O-chain polysaccharide on the LPS but also the abundance of O-chain polysaccharide was important for nodulation. For example, mutant strain R. etli CE166 produced, based on PAGE analysis of the LPS, only 40% LPS containing the O-chain polysaccharide compared with the parent strain, and the symbiotic phenotype of this mutant was the same as that observed for a mutant that entirely lacks the O-chain polysaccharide (7Forsberg L.S. Noel K.D. Box J. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51347-51359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A striking feature of LPS synthesis is that it is influenced by a variety of environmental factors (9Tao H. Brewin N.J. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS contained in bacteria isolated from the host (bean) nodules was diminished in its ability to bind monoclonal antibodies JIM28 and JIM29. In addition, the ability to bind these mAbs was also affected by pH, O2, or phosphate concentrations and temperature. Mutants that produced O-chain polysaccharide-containing LPS that do not change in their ability to bind JIM28 or JIM29 were impaired in their nodulation frequency and development (9Tao H. Brewin N.J. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2222-2229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that R. etli CE3, grown in the presence of P. vulgaris root or seed exudates, produced modified LPS that was no longer recognized by a particular monoclonal antibody (mAb), JIM28, specific for the O-chain polysaccharide of LPS from laboratory-cultured R. etli CE3 (10Noel K.D. Duelli D.M. Tao H. Brewin N.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 180-186Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Major compositional differences between LPS produced by CE3 cultures grown at pH 7.2 and that of pH 4.8 cultures included replacement of 2,3,4-tri-O-methylfucose by 2,3-di-O-methylfucose and an increase of 2-O-methylfucose content (11Bhat U.R. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results showed the importance of determining the molecular/genetic basis for these subtle structural changes to R. etli LPS. Here we describe the preparation of LPS from R. etli CE3 bacteroids purified from the host root nodules, and we compare its structure to that produced by R. etli CE3 grown under normal laboratory conditions (Fig. 1). Although LPS from CE3 bacteria and bacteroids were structurally similar, we observed that bacteroid LPS was antigenically different from that of bacteria and showed a doubling in 2-O-methylfucose within the O-chain polysaccharide. Mass spectrometry analyses also demonstrated that the lipid A from bacteroid LPS lacked a β-hydroxymyristic acid acyl residue. Our results also indicated that the R. etli CE3 bacteroid population that could resume growth was significantly more sensitive to cationic peptides than R. etli laboratory-cultured bacteria. Plant Growth and Nodule Preparation—For each aeroponic growth chamber (AGC), 180 P. vulgaris seeds (black turtle; Sacajawea Organic Foods) were surface-sterilized in 50 ml of 95% ethanol for 4 min while shaking the solution manually. The ethanol was discarded, and the seeds were washed two times with sterilized deionized water. The seeds were then rinsed with 50 ml of 5% sodium hypochloride (Acros Organics) for 4 min followed by several washes with sterilized deionized water (2 liter total volume). Seeds were transferred to plastic pots containing a 0.8% agarose layer (0.8 g per 100 ml of tap water) for germination (five seeds per pot to allow enough space for the seeds to germinate) and incubated in the dark at 30 °C for 4 days. The AGC consisted of a polypropylene barrel that was not light-transparent and a lid with 150 holes through which plants could grow. A humidifier (505 Defensor from Axair AG, Pfäffikon, Switzerland) was placed on the bottom of the barrel. A tap was present in the barrel, which allowed changing of the nutrient solution in an efficient manner, and the lid-barrel contact was tight so that no nutrient solution was lost during plant growth. The entire ACG, including the humidifier, was cleaned with 98% ethanol prior to use and rinsed with 10 liters of sterilized nitrogen-free nutrient solution (12Lullien V. Barker D.G. de Lajudie P. Huguet T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1987; 9: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the P. vulgaris seedlings were transferred to the AGC (one seedling per hole) and supported by some water-soaked horticultural rock wool. The latter also nicely sealed the space between the seedling and the lid material without damaging the hypocotyl. Remaining seed coats were removed manually prior to the transfer of the seedlings to the AGC. R. etli CE3 was grown as described (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the pellets of two 300-ml overnight late exponential phase cultures were extensively washed with nutrient solution and added to the AGC after seedlings were transferred. The nutrient solution, including the CE3 inoculum, was refreshed every other day for 4 weeks. The AGCs were placed in an acclimatized plant growth room with a photoperiod of 14/10, a relative humidity of 60%, and a day and night temperature of 23 and 18 °C, respectively. Mature nodules were manually harvested 4 weeks after seedlings were transferred to the AGC. The nodules were collected in 50-ml tubes and immediately frozen until bacteroids needed to be prepared for LPS purification. R. etli CE3 Bacteroid Isolation—A slightly modified stepwise sucrose gradient-based ultracentrifugation approach as described by Ching et al. (13Ching T.M. Hedtke S. Newcomb W. Plant Physiol. 1977; 60: 771-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for bacteroid isolation. Briefly, 5g of frozen nodules were extensively ground using a mortar and pestle until a homogeneous paste was obtained. Ten milliliters of filter-sterilized grinding buffer (13Ching T.M. Hedtke S. Newcomb W. Plant Physiol. 1977; 60: 771-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were added, and the mixture was manually stirred with a glass bar for a few minutes. Six polyallomer ultracentrifugation tubes with a capacity of 12.2 ml (Beckman Coulter) were prepared by adding the stepwise sucrose gradient (i.e. from bottom to top: 2.076 ml of 57% sucrose, 2.699 ml of 52% sucrose, 2.699 ml of 50% sucrose, and 2.076 ml of 45% sucrose). Care was taken to avoid mixing of different sucrose layers. The remaining space in the tube was filled with ∼1.6 ml of the crushed nodule mixture in grinding buffer. The tubes were equilibrated, placed in an SW40Ti rotor, and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 4 h at 10 °C (Beckman Coulter). When the ultracentrifugation run was completed, tubes were carefully removed from the rotor, and the five bands were immediately transferred to a separate tube using a Pasteur pipette. The bacteroids (band 4) were washed twice (7,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C) with phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and after washing, the pellet was resuspended in a final volume of 200 μl of phosphate buffer, collected in a 50-ml tube, and stored at –20 °C. When a total volume of 50 ml was obtained, the LPS was prepared using the hot phenol/water extraction as described below. Dot-blot Immunoblotting—Immunodot blot assays were prepared (14Kannenberg E.L. Brewin N.J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4543-4548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a fraction of an overnight CE3 culture or samples of the respective bands were washed with phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and diluted to an A600 equal to 1. One microliter of the initial concentration of each sample and of 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold dilutions were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane (Sigma) and air-dried for 1 h. The membrane was transferred to a small glass dish, which was put on a rocker set at low speed, and washed three times with TBS solution (50 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) for 15 min. Blocking was performed by adding 20 ml of 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in TBS and incubation for 30 min. The membrane was incubated overnight after addition of nitrogenase antibodies (1/5000 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin) (15Ma Y. Ludden P.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The membrane was then washed with TBS solution for 2 h during which the solution was refreshed at least five times. The membrane was incubated in the presence of alkaline phosphatase anti-rat IgG (Sigma; 1/5000 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin) and subsequently washed for 30 min in TBS solution during which the solution was refreshed at least five times. The membrane was developed in alkaline phosphatase substrate solution, containing 9 ml of Tris/HCl buffer (100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.6), 1 ml of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) solution (1 mg/ml NBT in Tris/HCl buffer plus 2% dimethyl sulfoxide), 100 μl of 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl phosphate (5 mg/ml in dimethylformamide), and 40 μlof1 m MgCl2. Cationic Peptide Sensitivity Assay—Overnight bacterial cultures of CE3 and CE338, the latter is affected in the synthesis of EPS (16Diebold R. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4821-4830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and freshly isolated bacteroids were extensively washed with phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, and diluted to an A600 equal to 1. The cationic peptides tested were melittin, polymyxin B, and poly-l-lysine (Sigma). For melittin, 1 μl of a 20 μg/ml stock solution was added to 800 μl of a solution of bacteria or bacteroids and incubated for 30 min at room temperature; for polymyxin B, 3 μlofa20 μg/ml stock solution was added to 10 μl of bacteria or bacteroids and incubated for 1 h at room temperature; and for poly-l-lysine, 3 μlofa50 μg/ml stock solution was added to 10 μl of bacteria or bacteroids and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The viability was determined as described previously (17D'Haeze W. Glushka J. De Rycke R. Holsters M. Carlson R.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 485-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This assay was repeated 10 times for each bacterial or bacteroid preparation with each cationic peptide, and a statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test. Averages were not significantly different when p > 0.05. Microscopy Techniques—An initial microscopic examination of the various bands obtained after ultracentrifugation was done using a classical Gram staining. Material from bands 1 through 5 and cultured CE3 bacteria were stained with crystal violet followed by a safranin staining (Sigma) and thereafter immediately examined using a light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Transmission electron microscopy was employed to observe cultured CE3 bacteria (negative control), purified CE3 bacteroids (band 4), and sections through mature nodules (positive control). For the latter, the nodules were treated and embedded for transmission electron microscopy as described previously (18D'Haeze W. De Rycke R. Mathis R. Goormachtig S. Pagnotta S. Verplancke C. Capoen W. Holsters M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 11789-11794Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The embedding of CE3 bacteria and bacteroids was done as follows (all procedures were carried out at 4 °C under rotation). Samples were extensively washed with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (Sigma) and fixed by a gradual fixation approach. The pellets were consecutively resuspended in 0.5% formaldehyde, 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 1.0% formaldehyde, 1.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 1.5% formaldehyde, 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, 2.0% formaldehyde, 2.0% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, and finally in 2.5% formaldehyde, 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer. Each time, the samples were incubated for 20 min. Then the pellets were washed three times with 0.1 m cacodylate buffer followed by a dehydration series, including 2 h in 30% ethanol, 2 h in 50% ethanol, overnight in 70% ethanol, 2 h in 95% ethanol, and overnight in 95% ethanol. The samples were then imbedded in LR White Hard Grade by resuspending the pellet overnight in ethanol/LR White (1/1 v/v), a step that was repeated two times. Finally, the pellets were resuspended in pure LR White and rotated overnight, which was repeated at least five times. The samples were transferred to capsules and incubated at 65 °C for 48 h to allow polymerization. Sections were made using an MT 6000-XL ultramicrotome (RMC, Inc., Tucson, AZ). Routine control sections were 1 μm thick and were stained with toluidine blue. Sections for transmission electron microscopy were 90 nm thick and collected on gilded copper slot grids (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA) that were placed on Formvar bridges to dry (19Rowley J.C.

Sections were post-stained for 2 min with 4% (w/v) aqueous uranyl acetate and for 0.5 min with lead citrate (20Reynolds E.S. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (17782) Google Scholar). Sections were examined at 80 kV with a Zeiss 902A electron microscope. LPS Isolation—Crude LPS was obtained from the bacteria and bacteroids using the hot phenol/water extraction procedure (21Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar), which was modified by Carlson et al. (22Carlson R.W. Sanders R.E. Napoli C. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 912-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The water phase containing the LPS was treated with RNase, DNase, and proteinase K, dialyzed, and then lyophilized (22Carlson R.W. Sanders R.E. Napoli C. Albersheim P. Plant Physiol. 1978; 62: 912-917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS extracted into the phenol phase was treated as described by Carrion et al. (23Carrion M. Bhat U.R. Reuhs B. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1725-1731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The LPS was purified from these crude preparations with affinity chromatography using polymyxin B-Sepharose (Pierce) (24Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Ridley B.L. Jeyaretnam B.S. Carlson R.W. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1013-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, the crude LPS was dissolved in 50 mm NH4CO3 and applied to the column. The column was then washed with 50 mm NH4CO3, followed by a solution of 300 mm triethylamine adjusted to pH 6.4 with acetic acid, and then a solution of 0.1 m NH4CO3 in 2 m urea to remove any non-LPS material from the column. The LPS was finally removed using a solution of 1% deoxycholate (DOC) in 0.1 m NH4CO3. The LPS was extensively dialyzed against a solution of 50 mm Tris base with 10% ethanol, then against deionized water, and lyophilized. For cultures grown in the presence anthocyanin, crude anthocyanin preparations were obtained by acid extraction, as described previously by Noel et al. (10Noel K.D. Duelli D.M. Tao H. Brewin N.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 180-186Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), from P. vulgaris seed (cv. Midnight Black Turtle Soup supplied by Idaho Seed Bean, Twin Falls, ID). R. etli CE3 was grown in medium (8Noel K.D. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5317-5324Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) to which the crude anthocyanin extract had been added as described (10Noel K.D. Duelli D.M. Tao H. Brewin N.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1996; 9: 180-186Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The LPS was isolated by hot phenol/water extraction as described above and purified by Sepharose 4B chromatography after dialysis and treatment with nucleases and proteinase K (21Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar, 26Carlson R.W. Kalembasa S. Turowski D. Pachori P. Noel K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—The LPS preparations were analyzed using DOC-PAGE, and the polyacrylamide gels were stained using the Alcian blue-silver staining procedure as described previously (27Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was also performed according to the method described by Reuhs et al. (27Reuhs B.L. Geller D.P. Kim J.S. Fox J.E. Kolli V.S.K. Pueppke S.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS-containing gels were soaked in transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 20% methanol) and electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a Bio-Rad Transblot SD semi-dry transfer cell set at a current of 20 V for 20 min. The membrane was equilibrated in TBS (0.2 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 5 min, then blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk (Bio-Rad) in TBS, and then overlaid with a 1/100 dilution of one of the primary mAbs (JIM26, JIM27, JIM28, or JIM29) in blocking solution. The membrane was then washed (five times for 5 min in TBS) and incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody, at 1/1000 dilution of the antibody. Finally, the membrane was equilibrated in substrate buffer (0.1 m Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5) and developed for 5 min using a developing solution of 20 ml of substrate buffer, 128 μl of NBT stock solution (50 mg/ml NBT in 70% dimethylformamide), and 66 μl of BCIP stock solution (50 mg/ml BCIP in 100% N,N-dimethylformamide). Once the bands were visible, the reaction was stopped by washing with deionized water. LPS Analysis—Compositions were determined by the preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of trimethysilyl methyl glycosides (28York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). This procedure was also used to determine the fatty acid composition of the LPS preparations (29Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glycosyl composition of the LPS preparations was also determined by the preparation and GC-MS analysis of alditol acetates (28York W.S. Darvill A.G. McNeil M. Stevenson T.T. Albersheim P. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 118: 3-40Crossref Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The location of methyl ether groups and the linkage positions of the various glycosyl residues were determined by the preparation and GC-MS analysis of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) as described by Ciucanu and Kerek (30Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3215) Google Scholar). Methylation was performed using tri-deuteriomethyliodide so that analysis of the partially methylated alditol acetates by GC-MS would reveal the location of the naturally occurring methyl groups on the LPS. The per-trideuteromethylated polysaccharides were hydrolyzed using 2 m trifluoroacetic acid at 121 °C for 2 h (29Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting partially (trideutero) methylated glycosyl residues were reduced using sodium borodeuteride and acetylated at 80 °C with a 1/1 mixture of acetic anhydride: pyridine (29Bhat U.R. Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14402-14410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The partially (trideutero) methylated alditol acetates were then analyzed using GC-MS. Analysis of the core oligosaccharides was determined by subjecting the LPS preparations to 1% acetic acid for 1 h at 100°C, removing the lipid A by centrifugation, and analysis of the carbohydrates by HPAEC using a Carbo PacPA-1 (Dionex) with pulsed amperometric detection as described previously (24Forsberg L.S. Carlson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2747-2757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Separation was achieved using a gradient of 3–90% sodium acetate (1 m) in 100 mm NaOH at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 50 min. The lipid A was obtained from the LPS by mild acid hydrolysis in 1% SDS in 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.5, as described by Caroff et al. (31Caroff M. Tacken A. Szab¢ L. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 175: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). After hydrolysis, the SDS was removed by washing the dried hydrolysis product residue with a solution of 2/1 deionized H2O:acidified ethanol (100 μlof4 m HCl in 20 ml of ethanol). The residue was collected by centrifugation and washed again with 95% ethanol. The ethanol washing steps were repeated several times, and the final residue was suspended in deionized water and lyophilized to give a white, fluffy lipid A preparation. MALDI-TOF MS was performed in the negative ion reflectron mode with a 337 nm nitrogen laser, operating at a 20-kV extraction voltage, and with time-delayed extraction. Approximately 2 μl of a 1 mg/ml lipid A solution in chloroform:methanol (3/1, v/v) was mixed with 1 μl of trihydroxyacetophenone matrix solution (∼93.5 mg of trihydroxyacetophenone/1 ml of methanol) and applied to the probe for mass analysis. Spectra were calibrated externally using Escherichia coli lipid A (Sigma). Efficient Production of Relatively High Numbers of R. etli CE3-induced P. vulgaris Root Nodules—Thus far, the conventional system to cultivate P. vulgaris (common bean) plants for nodulation experiments is with Leonard jars, in which the roots are grown in pots filled with vermiculite. This system works well for the symbiotic interaction between P. vulgaris and R. etli CE3 but is rather labor-intensive if one needs to scale-up plant growth, which was necessary in our study because of the fact that sufficient amounts of pure LPS are required to perform proper structural analyses and additional biological experiments. Therefore, we engineered an AGC in which 150 plants can be grown at once under semi-sterile conditions (Fig. 2). To demonstrate that nodulation under the AGC conditions is at least as efficient as in the conventional Leonard jars, we determined the average number of"

Previously, we demonstrated that a Sp1-based promoter is essential for constitutive transcription and a NF-κB-based intronic enhancer is responsible for cytokine-mediated induction.

Disruption of the loop structure causes a reduction of both constitutive and inductive transcription due to loss of the binding motif for NPM.

It is well established that MnSOD is essential for survival of aerobic life, because it mitigates reactive oxygen species-mediated cytotoxicity. MnSOD knock-out mice exhibit dilated cardiomyopathy, neuronal injury, and neonatal lethality (3.Lebovitz R.M. Zhang H. Vogel H. Cartwright Jr., J. Dionne L. Lu N. Huang S. Chan P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition to the role of MnSOD as an anti-oxidant, numerous studies suggest that MnSOD also acts as a tumor suppressor (12.Oberley L.W. Biomed. Pharmacother. 2005; 59: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). MnSOD activity is reduced in many types of transformed cells, and it appears that loss of MnSOD activity may be a general characteristic of many cancers (13.Oberley L.W. Buettner G.B. Cancer Res. 1979; 39: 1141-1149PubMed Google Scholar). We previously identified specific mutations located in the promoter region of the sod2 gene from cancer cells, which repress promoter activity apparently due to modification of transcription factor binding motifs (14.Xu Y. Krishnan A. Wan X.S. Majima H. Yeh C.-C. Ludewig G. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar).The sod2 gene is highly conserved among many species, including human, bovine, rat, and mouse (15.Marlhens F. Nicole A. Sinet P.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 129: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter region of the sod2 gene is characterized by an absence of TATA or CAAT boxes but exhibits multiple CG motifs containing binding sites for transcription factors Sp1 and AP-2 (16.Wan X.S. Devalaraja M.N. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Transcriptional analysis demonstrates that Sp1 is a key transcriptional activator of the sod2 gene, whereas AP-2 down-regulates the transcription by interfering with Sp1 activation (17.Yeh C.-C. Wan X.S. St. Calir D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18.Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In the family of antioxidant proteins, MnSOD is a member whose expression is rapidly up-regulated in response to oxidative stress. A number of studies have demonstrated that numerous stimuli activate MnSOD expression in various cells and tissues (5.Wong G.H. Elwell J. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar, 19.Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Boil. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We and others identified an intronic NF-κB enhancer element in both the human and mouse sod2 gene that is responsible for induction of MnSOD by TNF-α and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (19.Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Boil. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 20.Jones S.P. Ping D. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6970-6981Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We also demonstrated that treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induces expression of the human sod2 gene by specifically augmenting Sp1 binding to the promoter region (21.Porntadavity S. Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Rangnekar V.M. Prachayasitikul V. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 2001; 20: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and that combined treatment with TPA and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1β) further synergistically increases expression (22.Kiningham K.K. Xu Y. Daosukho C. Popova B. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2001; 353: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Recently, we identified NPM, a RNA-binding protein, as a cofactor with NF-κBin cytokine-mediated MnSOD induction (23.Dhar S.K. Lynn B.C. Daosukho C. St Clair D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28209-28219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The study of transcriptional regulation of the sod2 gene has demonstrated that a Sp1-activated proximal promoter is sufficient for constitutive transcription and that a NF-κB-activated enhancer is necessary for maximal stimulation. However, the mechanism of interaction between the enhancer and the GC-rich promoter to regulate MnSOD expression has not been elucidated. In the present study, we delineate the mechanism for molecular interaction between the enhancer and the promoter. The presence of a single-stranded 11G-loop structure in the human sod2 promoter region was suggested by the in vivo susceptibility of this region to dimethyl sulfate (DMS), and the result was confirmed by digesting genomic DNA with single-stranded DNA-specific S1 nuclease. Deletional and mutational analyses show that formation of the 11G-loop in the promoter region is necessary for basal promoter activity. Co-transfection with NPM results in transcriptional activation dependent on the integrity of the promoter secondary structure. electrophoretic mobility shift assay, DNase I footprinting, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicate that NPM directly binds to the upper strand 11G-loop structure but not to the lower strand or to double-stranded DNA. Transcriptional stimulation by combined TPA and cytokine treatment demonstrates that both NPM and the 11G-loop are also required for high level induction. The essential role of NPM for transcriptional regulation was confirmed by RNA interference. Analysis of protein interaction using a two-hybrid system shows formation of an NF-κB·NPM·Sp1 complex that is maintained by the association of NPM with the 11G-loop structure. ChIP assay further confirms protein complex formation, presumably bridging the enhancer and promoter regions via NPM anchored to the DNA loop. These data demonstrate the importance of NPM bound to the DNA loop structure in recruitment and interaction of transcription factors near the transcription start site and increase our understanding of the role of enhancer-promoter cooperation in transcriptional regulation of genes lacking TATA promoters.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Transfection and Treatments−VA13, an SV40-transformed human lung fibroblast WI38 cell line, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and grown in the recommended media. For cell transfection, the cells were plated in 12-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well. After culturing overnight, luciferase reporter constructs were co-transfected into cells with a β-galactosidase expression construct using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 36 h, the cells were treated with 100 units/ml recombinant human TNF-α (R&D Systems, Inc.), 2 ng/ml recombinant human IL-1β (Endogen), 100 mm TPA (Sigma), or a combination of the three reagents (hereafter referred to as “TIT”). After 12 h, the cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Activity of the luciferase reporter was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) with a TD-20/20 luminometer. β-Galactosidase activity was measured using chlorophenol red-α-d-galactopyranoside monosodium (Roche Applied Science) as a colorimetric substrate. Transcription activity was estimated by β-galactosidase-normalized luciferase responses.For stable transfection, luciferase reporter constructs were linearized by digestion with XmnI and co-transfected with pSV2-NEO for selection of individual clones using the culture media containing 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). The luciferase assay was used to select stable transfected cell clones, which were confirmed by Southern hybridization. The procedure for Southern hybridization has been previously described (24.St Clair D.K. Holland J.C. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 939-943PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA isolated from each individual cell clone was digested with PstI, separated on 0.8% agarose gels, transferred to Nylon transfer membranes, and hybridized with a luciferase-specific probe. For preparation of the probe, a 400-bp fragment of the luciferase coding region was amplified by PCR and labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Random primers DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Sequences of the PCR primers were: forward, 5′-CTGAATACAAATCACAGAAT-3′; reverse, 5′-GCAGACCAGTAGATCCAGAG-3′. The probe was purified by a Nick column (Amersham Biosciences). Southern blots were scanned by a using a Typhoon 8600 scanner (Amersham Biosciences).DMS Reactivity and S1 Nuclease Digestion−Susceptibility of the 11G-loop region to DMS in vivo was measured in VA13 cells using a procedure of ligation-mediated PCR as previously described (25.Granger S.W. Fan H. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8961-8970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were treated with a series of DMS dilutions, and genomic DNA was extracted from the treated cells. Genomic DNA extracted from DMS-untreated cells was subjected to A + G and C + T chemical sequencing using a Maxam-Gilbert DNA sequencing kit (Sigma). 2 μg of DNA was cleaved with 10% piperidine at 90 °C for 30 min, and the sample was dried using a speed vacuum. Piperidine was removed by ethanol precipitation twice. The cleaved DNA was extended by pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene) with a gene-specific primer1 (P1, 5′-ATCTGCTGAAGCCCGCTGCCGAAGC-3′) and tagged with a linker by T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs). The ligated DNA fragments were amplified by AccuPrimer GC-Rich DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using a linker primer with a gene-specific primer2 (P2, 5′-GCCGAAGCCACCACAGCCACGAGT-3′). The PCR products were extracted by phenol/chloroform and then precipitated by ethanol. The purified PCR products were labeled by the AccuPrimer GC-Rich DNA polymerase with a gene-specific primer3 (P3, 5′-TCCTGCGCCGCCCGCGGGCCTTAAGAAA-3′), which was prelabeled with 32P. The samples were separated on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gels and scanned by Typhoon 8600. To confirm the results from the detection of the 11G-loop in vivo, genomic DNA extracted from DMS-untreated VA13 cells was treated with S1 nuclease, a single-stranded nucleotide-specific nuclease. To determine the position of S1 nuclease cleavage, the S1 nuclease-treated DNA sample was ligated using a rapid DNA ligation kit containing T4 DNA ligase (Roche Applied Science) and amplified by PCR with a gene-specific primer set. The PCR products were observed on 2% agarose gel and purified by treating with ExoSAP-IT (USP Corp.). DNA sequencing for the PCR products was performed by Davis Sequencing Service. Furthermore, DNA folding analysis was performed to predict formation of the loop structure using the mfold web server (version 3.2).Expression Constructs−Previously, we constructed sod2 promoter reporter (P7) and enhancer-promoter reporter (I2E-P7) plasmids, as well as a plasmid with the mutated NF-κB binding site in the I2E region (NF-κB/M) (19.Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Boil. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In this study, site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate constructs in which the 11G-loop was interrupted using several different strategies illustrated in Fig. 2A. Oligonucleotides containing deletions and mutations were cloned to replace the wild-type sequences between SmaI (–131) and PvuII (–61) sites. Sequences of mutation- and deletion-targeting oligonucleotides are described by upper strands as below: loop/Del, 5′-GGGGTTGGGCGCGGCGGGCGCGGGGCGGGGCCCCGC———–CGGGGCGGCGGTGCCCCTTGCGGCGCAG-3′ (break line shows the 11G sequence that was deleted); loop/Str, 5′-GGGGTTGGGCGCGGCGGGCGCGGGGCGGGGaCaGaGGGGGGGGGGGCGGGGCGGCGGTGCCCTTGCGGCGCAG-3′ (underline, the 11G sequence; small letters, the replaced bases); loop/Cancer, 5′-GGGGTTGGGCGCGGCCGGGCGCGGGGCGGGGCtCGCGGGGGGaGGGGGCGGGGCGGCGGTGCCCTTGCGGCGCAG-3′ (small letters, the mutations identified in cancer cells); and loop/Atl, 5′-GGGGTTGGGCGCGGCGGGCGCGGGGCGGGGaCaGaGGGGGGGGGGtCtGtGCGGCGGTGCCCTTGCGGCGCAG-3′. The constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression constructs for human NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, Sp1, and NPM were included in the co-transfection experiments. The p50, p65, and Sp1 constructs were gifts from colleagues (26.Courey A.J. Holtzman D.A. Jackson S.P. Tjian R.

The mRNA served as a template to synthesize single-stranded cDNA by reverse transcription with poly-T primer (Invitrogen). After template digestion with RNase H (Invitrogen), the cDNA was amplified by TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) using specific primers for the human sod2 gene. Sequences were: forward, 5′-AGCATGTTGAGCCGGGCAGT-3′; reverse, 5′-AGGTTGTTCACGTAGGCCGC-3′. To normalize MnSOD RT-PCR products, a set of primers was used to amplify the human β-actin gene. The primers were: forward, 5′-TGATGATATCGCCGCGCTCGTCGT-3′; reverse, 5′-CACAGCCTGGATAGCAACGTACAT-3′.Immunoblotting Analysis−To quantify protein levels, total cellular protein was isolated. 50 μg of protein extracts from the cultured cells were fractionated on SDS-PAGE, 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. MnSOD was quantified using a primary polyclonal MnSOD antibody (Upstate Biotech.) with a goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). NPM and β-actin were measured using primary monoclonal antibodies against NPM (NeoMarkers) and β-actin (Sigma) with a goat anti-mouse IgGhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Human β-actin was used to normalize MnSOD and NPM. Immunoblots were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences).Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay−10 μg of NPM/pcDNA or the pcDNA vector control were transfected into 5 × 106 VA13 cells. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the transfected cells as described previously (19.Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C.-C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. DNA Cell Boil. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Purified NPM protein was purchased from Abnova Corp. A fragment (–110 to –77) containing the wild-type (loop/WT) or mutant-type sequences (loop/Str) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs). The probes were purified on 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and quantified by scintillation counting (Beckman). 10 μg of the nuclear extracts and 0.2 μg of NPM protein were incubated with 0.5 pm probes for 30 min on ice before separation on 4% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) electrophoresis buffer. Specific binding was confirmed by probe competition reactions with 100-fold concentration of cold oligonucleotides containing loop/WT, loop/Str, loop/Cancer, or non-self control. To confirm the specific binding, 1 μg of NPM antibody was incubated on ice with 0.2 μg of NPM protein for 1 h prior to incubation with the probes. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and scanned by using a Typhoon 8600.DNase I Footprinting Analysis−A ClaI-HindIII fragment containing the promoter sequence (–210 to +1) was obtained by digesting P7/pGL3 and purified using a gel-purification kit (Qiagen). The fragment was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 DNA kinase and digested with BglII to generate double-stranded DNA probes with top-strand labeling. The labeled double-stranded DNA was boiled for 5 min to generate single-stranded probe labeled at the 5′-end. The double-stranded and single-stranded probes (1 pm) were incubated with 1 μg of Sp1, AP-2, and NPM proteins on ice for 10 min within a Core DNase I Footprinting System (Promega) followed by partial digestion with DNase I as described previously (18.Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The footprinting samples were separated on 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide sequencing gels and scanned by using a Typhoon 8600.RNA Interference−Post-transcriptional small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to test the effect of NPM on transcriptional regulation. NPM siRNA (0.1 μm, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was co-transfected with I2E-P7 constructs in each well of 12-well plates containing a low density of cells (105/well) in serum-reduced Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) and followed by TIT treatment. NPM was measured by Western blots, and the effects of NPM siRNA on regulation of transcription were measured by reporter responses.ChIP−ChIP assay was performed to investigate protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions involved in transcriptional regulation using a ChIP-IT system (Active Motif) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR was used to quantify the enhancer and promoter regions. The sequences of the primer set for the enhancer region were: forward, 5′-CGGGGTTATGAAATTTGTTGAGTA-3′; reverse, 5′-CCACAAGTAAAGGACTGAAATTAA-3′. For amplifying the GC-rich sod2 promoter region, AccuPrimer GC-Rich DNA polymerase was used with a pair of primers for amplifying the (–154 to –6) fragment: forward, 5′-ACAGGCACGCAGGGCACCCCCGGGGTT-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCTGCGCCGCCCGCGGGCCTTAAGAAA-3′. An exon2 fragment was amplified as an untargeted control: forward, 5′-TGACCGGGCTGTGCTTTCTCG-3′; reverse, 5′-ACTGCCTCCCGCCGCTCAGCC-3′. The GAPDH promoter region pulled down by TFIIB antibody was amplified as an internal control using the following primers: forward, 5′-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCGAACAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-3′. Chromatin pulled down by IgG served as a negative antibody control. In addition to DNA analysis for the ChIP products, Western blots were performed to quantify the associated proteins in the same ChIP preparations. The eluted complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted by polyclonal primary antibodies for NF-κB p50 or p65 and a monoclonal primary antibody for Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).Two-hybrid Analysis−A mammalian hybridization system (Promega) was modified to detect protein-protein interactions. With exception of Sp1/pBD that was previously constructed (18.Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), NF-κB p50, p65, and NPM were cloned in either pBIND or pACT within XbaI-NotI sites to tag them with either the Gal4-binding fusion domain or the VP16-activation fusion domain, respectively. Primers with XbaI and NotI sites at the 3′- and 5′-ends were designed to perform PCR cloning for the proteins of interest using a high-fidelity pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Primers were designed according to gene information from NBCI: p50 (S76638), p65 (M62399), and NPM (BC016768). The resulting constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Hybridization experiment was performed to investigate direct interaction between two proteins as described previously (18.Xu Y. Porntadavity S. St Clair D.K. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The two-hybrid system was modified to examine the function of the third protein (NPM). To determine whether the loop structure is necessary for enhancer-promoter communication, single-stranded oligonucleotides with or without the 11G-loop structure were added to the modified two-hybridization system to compete for NPM binding. A 36-bp non-self oligonucleotide containing sequences of multiple cloning sites in the pGL3 vector was included as a negative control in the competition experiment.Statistical Analysis−Multiple independent cell transfection and reporter assays were performed. PCR products and Western blots were quantified using imaging quantitative software Quantity One (Bio-Rad). Comparisons between the different constructs or treatments were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test followed by data analysis with GraphPad Prism version 4.0. Differences at p < 0.01 were considered significant.RESULTSAn 11G-Loop in the Promoter Region Is Essential for the Constitutive Transcription of the Human sod2 Gene−Our previous studies demonstrated that the mutations found in the promoter region of the human sod2 gene in cancer cells repress constitutive transcription. We hypothesized that the mechanism involved the disruption of a putative single-stranded loop structure (14.Xu Y. Krishnan A. Wan X.S. Majima H. Yeh C.-C. Ludewig G. Kasarskis E.J. St Clair D.K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To evaluate the presence of the loop structure in the promoter region in vivo, genomic DNA extracted from DMS-treated VA13 cells was cleaved by piperidine and screened by ligation-mediated PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, the 11G single-stranded loop, identified by positions shown from chemical sequencing of genomic DNA, was susceptible to low concentrations of DMS. Furthermore, cleavage of genomic DNA by a single-stranded DNA-specific nuclease supports the presence of a single-stranded loop structure in the sod2 promoter. The S1 nuclease-cleaved fragments were ligated by T4 DNA ligase and amplified by PCR (Fig. 1B). The position of S1 nuclease cleavage was determined by sequencing the PCR products, which showed that a small fragment (–120 to –98) was removed by S1 nuclease (Fig. 1C). In addition, folding analysis for single-stranded DNA using mfold software predicted the loop structure with melting temperature (Tm) at 63.1 °C in 10 mm NaCl as illustrated in Fig. 1D.FIGURE 1Determination of an 11G single-stranded loop structure in the human sod2 promoter region. A, genomic DNA extracted from DMS-treated VA13 cells was cleaved by piperidine. Ligation-mediated PCR was used to screen the loop structure as illustrated at the right. As markers, genomic DNA extracted from DMS-untreated cells was chemically sequenced (C+T and A+G reactions). Sequence of the promoter region is labeled according to the results of chemical sequencing. Susceptibility of the 11G-loop to DMS is indicated by open arrows. B, 1 μg of genomic DNA was digested with 1 unit of S1 nuclease and followed by ligation using T4 DNA ligase. PCR was used to amplify the re-ligated promoter region. The size of PCR product amplified from the untreated control is indicated by the arrow. C, the PCR products in B were sequenced. Nucleotides removed by S1 nuclease are indicated. D, a putative 11G single-stranded loop structure. The sequence numbers shown in C and D are related to the transcription-initiation site (+1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To elucidate the role of the 11G-loop in transcriptional regulation, we eliminated the loop structure using three different strategies as shown in Fig. 2A: deleting the 11G sequence (loop/Del), eliminating the 11G-loop by straightening the loop out using A/T bases to replace G/C bases (loop/Str), and replacing the wild-type sequence with the cancer-type sequence initially identified in the colon cancer cell line, HT29 (loop/Cancer). In addition, an alternative loop structure was constructed by reconstituting the loop through alternative base paring by changing G/C bases to A/T bases (loop/Alt). The promoter fra"

Herein, we demonstrate by sucrose gradient analyses that, in the presence of TGFβ but not in the absence, km23-1 was present in early endosomes with the TβRs. Further, confocal microscopy studies indicate that endogenous km23-1 was co-localized with endogenous Smad2 at early times after TGFβ treatment, prior to Smad2 translocation to the nucleus. In addition, immunoprecipitation/blot analyses showed that TGFβ regulated the interaction between endogenous km23-1 and endogenous Smad2 in vivo. Blockade of km23-1 using a small interfering RNA approach resulted in a reduction in both total intracellular Smad2 levels and in nuclear levels of phosphorylated Smad2 after TGFβ treatment. This decrease was reversed by lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26 S proteasome, suggesting that knockdown of km23-1 causes proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated (i.e. activated) Smad2. Blockade of km23-1 also resulted in a reduction in TGFβ/Smad2-dependent ARE-Lux transcriptional activity, which was rescued by a km23-1 small interfering RNA-resistant construct. In contrast, a reduction in TGFβ/Smad3-dependent SBE2-Luc transcriptional activity did not occur under similar conditions. Furthermore, overexpression of the dynactin subunit dynamitin, which is known to disrupt dynein-mediated intracellular transport, blocked TGFβ-stimulated nuclear translocation of Smad2. Collectively, our findings indicate for the first time that a dynein light chain is required for a Smad2-dependent TGFβ signaling pathway.

The fact that km23-1 is a DLC, as well as a TβR-interacting protein, suggests that it may function as a motor receptor for the transport of TGFβ signaling components intracellularly (13Tang Q.

Then, the activated receptor complex can phosphorylate Smads 2 and 3, and these receptor-activated Smads (RSmads) then form a complex with Smad4.

In addition, consistent with a role for km23-1 in TGFβ signaling, small interfering RNA (siRNA) blockade of km23-1 expression resulted in a decrease in specific TGFβ-mediated cellular responses, including an induction of fibronectin expression and an inhibition of cell cycle progression (31Jin Q. Ding W. Staub C.M. Gao G. Tang Q. Mulder K.M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Because we have shown that km23-1 is required for mediating specific TGFβ responses, and because it is well established that the Smads are key TGFβ signaling components, here we investigated the role of km23-1 in controlling Smad compartmentalization and transcriptional activation. We provide the first evidence that TGFβ can induce the interaction of endogenous km23-1 with endogenous Smad2. Further, we show that endogenous km23-1 and endogenous Smad2 are co-localized in a TGFβ- and time-dependent manner, prior to Smad2 translocation to the nucleus. Endogenous km23-1 was also localized in early endosomal compartments with the TβRs after TGFβ treatment. siRNA-specific blockade of km23-1 resulted in a depletion of intracellular Smad2, which was partially blocked by the proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin, suggesting that 26 S proteasomal degradation of Smad2 can occur in the absence of km23-1. In keeping with these results, blockade of km23-1 also reduced TGFβ/Smad2-dependent transcriptional regulation. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that dynein-dependent intracellular events are required for Smad2 nuclear translocation after TGFβ treatment, because overexpression of dynamitin inhibited these effects. Thus, our results demonstrate for the first time that the DLC km23-1, as well as dynein motor activity, are required for a Smad2-dependent TGFβ signaling pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—The mouse IgG antibody (Ab) was from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti-DIC monoclonal Ab (MAB1618) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The rabbit IgG, the rabbit TβRII Ab (SC-220), the rabbit TβRI Ab (SC-389), the Lamin A/C Ab (SC-7293), and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PC10) Ab (SC-56) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Lactacystin was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).Antibody Production—The rabbit polyclonal km23-1 anti-serum used for the immunofluorescence studies was prepared against the following sequence: MAEVEETLKRLQSQK (corresponding to amino acids 1-15 of human km23-1) (AnaSpec, San Jose, CA). The company also provided pre-immune serum. The rabbit km23-1 anti-serum against amino acids 27-43 of human km23-1 (hkm23-1-(27-43)-w) used for Western blotting analysis was prepared as described previously (31Jin Q. Ding W. Staub C.M. Gao G. Tang Q. Mulder K.M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).Cell Culture—Mv1Lu (CCL-64) cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (CCL-34) were also obtained from ATCC and were grown in Minimum Essential Medium-α supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cultures were routinely screened for mycoplasma using Hoechst 33258 staining (13Tang Q. Staub C.M. Gao G. Jin Q. Wang Z. Ding W. Aurigemma R.E. Mulder K.M. Mol. Biol.

Twenty-four hours after plating, the medium was replaced with serum-free minimum essential-α medium. Thirty minutes after incubation, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were cultured in the absence or presence of TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for 5 min (ten 10-cm plates each). Early-endosome-containing fractions were then prepared as described previously (36Lin H.K. Bergmann S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2004; 431: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).siRNAs—km23-1 siRNA and the negative control (NC siRNA) were prepared as described previously (31Jin Q. Ding W. Staub C.M. Gao G. Tang Q. Mulder K.M. Cell Signal. 2005; 17: 1363-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The siRNA was designed in a region of km23-1 where the mink and human forms do not differ.Immunofluorescence Microscopy Analyses—For km23-1 and Smad2 co-localization experiments, Mv1Lu cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Subsequently, these cells were incubated with km23-1 rabbit anti-serum (1:200) and 5 μg/ml anti-Smad2 monoclonal Ab for 1 h, respectively. The bound primary antibodies were visualized with 2 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (green) and cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (red). Co-localization of km23-1 and Smad2 is indicated by a yellow color (merge). Images were collected with a Leica TCS SP2 AOBS confocal microscope. The images in supplemental Fig. S1 were de-convoluted using Huygens Essential software from Scientific Volume Imaging (Exton, PA). Co-localization of km23-1 and Smad2 puncta was quantified using the co-localization function in Image Pro Plus 4.1 software (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Silver Spring, MD). A similar approach has been used to quantify the co-localization of other proteins as described previously (37Grigoryev S.A. Nikitina T. Pehrson J.R. Singh P.B. Woodcock C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6153-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). At least five cells in each group from each double-labeled experiment were analyzed for co-localization of km23-1 and Smad2. For the immunofluorescence analyses to study the effects of siRNAs on nuclear expression and translocation of Smad2 by TGFβ, the cells were fixed and permeabilized as for the co-localization studies. Subsequently, these cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-Smad2 monoclonal Ab for 2 h, and then the bound Ab was visualized with 2 μg/ml Alexa 594 goat anti-mouse IgG. Immunofluorescence images were captured using a Nikon Diaphot microscope with a Retiga 1300 charge-coupled device camera (BioVision Technologies, Inc., Exton, PA) running IPLab v3.6.3 software (Scanalytics, Inc., Fairfax, VA). One hundred green fluorescence protein (GFP)-positive cells were counted for cultures of both km23-1 siRNA-transfected and NC siRNA-transfected cells. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole staining designates individual cells. Triplicate fields are shown for each condition. For the immunofluorescence analyses to study the effects of overexpression of dynamitin on nuclear translocation of Smad2 by TGFβ, the cells were analyzed as for the studies of the effects of siRNAs on nuclear expression and translocation of Smad2, except that the cells were co-transfected with GFP and empty vector (EV) or dynamitin.Cellular Fractionation—The NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent kit (78833, Pierce) was used to fractionate Mv1Lu cells according to the manufacturer's protocol.Luciferase Reporter Assays—Mv1Lu cells were plated at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 in 12-well plates. Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were transfected with the indicated amounts of either km23-1 siRNA or NC siRNA, together with the activin-responsive element (ARE)-Lux and FAST-1 (38Yeo C.Y. Chen X. Whitman M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26584-26590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), or the Smad-binding element (SBE)2-Luc (39Zawel L. Dai J.L. Buckhaults P. Zhou S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Kern S.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Renilla was used to normalize transfection efficiencies, and pcDNA3.1 was used to normalize the amount of total DNA transfected as described previously (40Liu G. Ding W. Neiman J. Mulder K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 29479-29490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. 1 h after incubation, Mv1Lu cells were cultured in the absence or presence of TGFβ (5 ng/ml) for an additional 18 h. Luciferase activity was measured using Promega's Dual-luciferase Reporter Assay System following the manufacturer's instructions. All assays were performed in triplicate. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E.km23-1 siRNA-resistant km23-1-FLAG Construct—The wild-type FLAG-tagged km23-1 plasmid (pCMV-km23-1-FLAG) was constructed by fusing the full-length human km23-1 to the pFLAG-CMV-5a vector (Sigma) (13Tang Q. Staub C.M. Gao G. Jin Q. Wang Z. Ding W. Aurigemma R.E. Mulder K.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4484-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To generate the km23-1 siRNA-resistant km23-1-FLAG construct (pCMV-Δkm23-1-FLAG), the pCMV-km23-1-FLAG plasmid was used as a template and was mutated by site-directed mutagenesis PCR (Stratagene) as described by Lassus P et al. (41Lassus P. Rodriguez J. Lazebnik Y. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : PL13Google Scholar). This modified plasmid contains six silent mutations in the km23-1 siRNA target sequence, corresponding to nucleotides 251-271 of the human km23-1 coding region. The DNA sequence for pCMV-Δkm23-1-FLAG was altered from 5′-AAGACTATTTCCTGATTGTGA-3′ to 5′-AGGATTACTTTTTAATTGTGA-3′. Compared with pCMV-km23-1-FLAG, there is no change in the amino acid sequence expressed by pCMV-Δkm23-1-FLAG.RESULTSPrevious reports have shown that the early endosome pathway plays a critical role in TβR endocytosis and subsequent TGFβ signal transduction (42Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 43Dore Jr., J.J. Edens M. Garamszegi N. Leof E.B. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 8: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Specifically, the TβRs are known to be internalized with Smad2 into early endosomes within minutes of TGFβ addition to cells (42Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 45Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Further, our previous data suggested that TβRII kinase activity was required for the ability of the DLC km23-1 to bind the dynein motor through the DIC, as well as for TGFβ responses downstream (13Tang Q. Staub C.M. Gao G. Jin Q. Wang Z. Ding W. Aurigemma R.E. Mulder K.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4484-4496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Thus, the DLC km23-1 may recruit early endosomal TGFβ signaling complexes during intracellular transport and downstream effects, following TβR endocytosis. Accordingly, it was of interest to examine whether endogenous km23-1 might be co-localized with the TβRs in early endosomes after TGFβ treatment. To assess this, we performed sucrose flotation gradients to isolate endosomal compartments enriched for early endosome antigen-1 (EEA1) (36Lin H.K. Bergmann S. Pandolfi P.P. Nature. 2004; 431: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), followed by Western blotting with km23-1-specific rabbit anti-serum or TβRI/RII Abs as described under “Materials and Methods.” As expected, in the absence of TGFβ (left panel), the majority of TβRII (top panel) and TβRI (second panel) were present in fractions 6-8. However, upon TGFβ activation (right panel), the amount of TβRII and TβRI present in EEA1-enriched fractions was increased (fractions 4 and 5), consistent with a previous report (45Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The bottom panel indicates the localization of EEA1, designating the fractions containing early endosomes. In terms of km23-1 localization (third panel), in the absence of TGFβ (left panel), km23-1 was not present in the early endosomal fractions (fractions 4 and 5). Instead, the majority of km23-1 accumulated in fractions 6-8. However, as early as 5 min after TGFβ addition (right panel), km23-1 was present in the EEA1-enriched early endosomal fractions (fractions 4 and 5). Moreover, even upon a much longer exposure (not shown) of the km23-1 expression data in the absence of TGFβ (Fig. 1, left), no km23-1 was detectable in the EEA1-enriched early endosomal fractions. We also noticed that total km23-1 levels were higher in the presence of TGFβ. However, using EEA1 levels as an expression control to compare two different gradient runs (42Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar), it was clear that the EEA1 levels were also higher in the presence of TGFβ, suggesting that the increase in km23-1 was due to differential loading. Thus, the results in Fig. 1 demonstrate that endogenous km23-1 is present in early endosomes with endogenous TβRs in the presence of TGFβ.Because Smad2 is a critical intracellular mediator of TGFβ responses (47Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Curr. Opin Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 48Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3964) Google Scholar), co-localized with TβRII in EEA1-positive early endosomes after TβRs endocytosis (42Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar, 45Hayes S. Chawla A. Corvera S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 1239-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that km23-1 might be co-localized with Smad2 in a punctate staining pattern, indicative of the co-existence of km23-1 and Smad2 in endosomal compartments. Thus, we performed immunofluorescence studies using confocal microscopy after TGFβ treatment of TGFβ-responsive Mv1Lu cells, using km23-1-specific rabbit anti-serum (left panels) or a Smad2 Ab (middle panels), respectively. As indicated in Fig. 2, in the absence of TGFβ (top panel), Smad2 (middle panel) was concentrated in cytoplasmic punctate vesicular structures, consistent with a previous report (49Tsukazaki T. Chiang T.A. Davison A.F. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 779-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Similarly, endogenous km23-1 displayed a punctate staining pattern that was present throughout the cytoplasm in the absence of TGFβ (left, top panel). Co-localization is shown as a yellow color (right, top panel), and was quantified using Image Pro Plus 4.1 software from Media Cybernetics, Inc. The percentages of co-localization were obtained from multiple images as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the absence of TGFβ, co-localization of km23-1 with Smad2 was ∼13%. There was a slight increase in co-localization of km23-1 with Smad2 at 2 min (∼18%) after TGFβ treatment. However, TGFβ treatment resulted in greater co-localization of km23-1 and Smad2 at 5 min (∼28%) after TGFβ addition to Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 2, third panels). This level of co-localization was sim"
https://openalex.org/W2006934547,"BRCA1 mutation carriers have an 85% lifetime risk of breast cancer and 60% for ovarian cancer. BRCA1 facilitates DNA double-strand break repair, and dysfunction of BRCA1 leads to hypersensitivity to DNA damaging agents and consequently genomic instability of cells. In this communication, we have examined the tumor incidence and survival of Brca1 heterozygous female mice. Brca1 heterozygotes appear to have a shortened life span with 70% tumor incidence. Lymphoma, but not ovarian and mammary gland tumors, occurs commonly in these mice. After a whole-body exposure to ionizing radiation, Brca1 heterozygous mice have a 3–5-fold higher incidence specific to ovarian tumors, but not lymphoma, when compared with the Brca1+/+ mice. All the tumors from heterozygous mice examined retain the wild-type allele and the cancer cells express Brca1 protein, precluding the chromosomal mechanism for loss of heterozygosity of Brca1 locus. Although the manifestation of BRCA1 haploinsufficiency may be different between human and mouse, this study suggests that women carrying Brca1 mutations may be more prone to ovarian tumor formation after IR exposure than nonmutation carriers."

To this day, a handful of enzyme systems has been shown to rely on essential residue motions for catalysis, but the generality of such phenomena remains to be elucidated. Using NMR spectroscopy, we investigated the electronic and dynamic effects of several mutations at position 105 in TEM-1 β-lactamase, an enzyme responsible for antibiotic resistance. Even in absence of substrate, our results show that the number and magnitude of short and long range effects on 1H-15N chemical shifts are correlated with the catalytic efficiencies of the various Y105X mutants investigated. In addition, 15N relaxation experiments on mutant Y105D show that several active-site residues of TEM-1 display significantly altered motions on both picosecond-nanosecond and microsecond-millisecond time scales despite many being far away from the site of mutation. The altered motions among various active-site residues in mutant Y105D may account for the observed decrease in catalytic efficiency, therefore suggesting that short and long range residue motions could play an important catalytic role in TEM-1 β-lactamase.

Enzymes are extremely efficient catalysts that can accelerate biochemical reactions up to a factor of 1018 when compared with the same uncatalyzed reaction (1Neet K.E. J. Biol.

A general view of such correlation between structure, function, and dynamics in enzymes would greatly improve our current understanding of these powerful catalysts. In this study, we provide experimental evidence supporting the importance of active-site residue motions in the enzyme TEM-1 β-lactamase through the characterization of various Y105X mutants by NMR spectroscopy. We have previously investigated the role of the active-site residue Tyr105 in TEM-1 β-lactamase using saturation mutagenesis, enzyme kinetics, and in silico molecular dynamics studies (25Doucet N.

Our results show that this residue is mainly involved in substrate discrimination and stabilization at the active site of TEM-1. Aromatic residues at position 105 were shown to play an important role in substrate stabilization by preventing steric hindrance with substrate molecules through the formation of a rigid, stabilizing wall that restricts the active-site cavity size, and therefore substrate movement. Most non-aromatic residue replacements at position 105 were found to possess too many degrees of freedom for appropriate substrate stabilization, thus explaining the strong aromatic bias observed in other class A β-lactamases at this active-site position. Interestingly, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105A were moderately active in hydrolysis of penicillin substrates, despite the fact that they are not aromatic. Increasing side chain length (and flexibility) generally resulted in important decreases in activity. Charged side chains (except the aromatic His) were also poorly compatible with reactivity. These kinetic observations correlated with the extent of Y105X side chain motion upon molecular modeling in the presence of a penicillin substrate; only the aromatic and the small residues provided a stable, well organized binding environment over the short time scale tested (picosecond). To further explore dynamics of these TEM-1 β-lactamase active-site mutants, we turned to nuclear magnetic resonance. NMR relaxation experiments are powerful techniques that can provide valuable information on the dynamic effects of mutations in the active-site cavity of enzymes during catalysis (10Eisenmesser E.Z.

In addition to providing information on fast dynamics (picosecond-nanosecond (ps-ns)) of protein backbones (26Jarymowycz V.A. Stone M.J. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 1624-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), the time scale of NMR dynamics ranges up to the catalytically relevant microsecond-millisecond (μs-ms) (27Akke M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 642-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The recent and complete 1H, 15N, 13C backbone resonance assignments of TEM-1 (E28G) β-lactamase by NMR (28Savard P.Y. Sosa-Peinado A. Levesque R.C. Makinen M.W. Gagné; S.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) as well as 15N relaxation backbone dynamics studies on the same enzyme (29Savard P.Y. Gagné; S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) now pave the way to the motional characterization of important active-site residues with respect to their effect on catalysis in this enzyme family. To improve the interpretation of our previous molecular modeling and kinetics observations at the molecular level and to verify the proposed motion of residue 105 in TEM-1, this study describes the backbone resonance assignments of TEM-1 mutants Y105D, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105W as well as 15N relaxation and backbone dynamics of wild-type TEM-1 and mutant Y105D. To our surprise, the localized dynamic effects we had originally observed by molecular modeling in the area of position 105 extend to a far broader environment, affecting catalytically relevant motional time scales of important catalytic residues in the active-site cavity of TEM-1. The dynamic investigation of the Y105D mutant and the effects of the Y105X mutations on the surrounding environment provide evidence for the importance of active-site residue motions in TEM-1 β-lactamase as well as their possible role in substrate stabilization and catalysis. In addition to long range effects observed for residues distal to the active site as well as evidence offered by previous molecular dynamics investigation performed on a TEM-1 mutant (30Meroueh S.O. Roblin P. Golemi D. Maveyraud L. Vakulenko S.B. Zhang Y. Samama J.P. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9422-9430Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), these experimental observations suggest that class A β-lactamases may rely on long range residue motions in substrate recognition as well as for catalysis.

Plasmid pET-TEM-1 (31Sosa-Peinado A. Mustafi D. Makinen M.W. Protein Expression Purif. 2000; 19: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in which the wild-type blaTEM-1 gene was fused to the leader sequence of ompA was a generous gift from Marvin D. Makinen (University of Chicago). It was maintained using 30 μg/ml kanamycin and was used for extracellular protein expression under the control of the T7 promoter in E. coli BL21(DE3). The construction of plasmids pQE32Chl-TEM(Y105X) containing the Y105X mutations of TEM-1 was described elsewhere (25Doucet N. De Wals P.Y. Pelletier J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46295-46303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides and Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and by the Plate-Forme d’Analyses Biomolé;culaires (Université; Laval, Qué;bec, Canada). Oligonucleotide primers used for DNA sequencing were synthesized by Li-Cor Biotechnology (Lincoln, NB). The E28G mutation originally present in the pET-TEM-1 construction was reverted back to WT using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) with mutagenic primers TEM-G28E-upper (5′-CAGGCCCACCCAGAAACGCTGGTGAAAGTA-3′) and TEM-G28E-lower (5′-TACTTTCACCAGCGTTTCTGGGTGGGCCTG-3′). The Y105D, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105W mutants of TEM-1 (25Doucet N. De Wals P.Y. Pelletier J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46295-46303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were PCR-amplified from vectors pQE32Chl-TEM(Y105X) using the two following terminal primers: TEMHinDIIIR (5′-ACACACAAGCTTTTACCAATGCTTAATCAGTGA-3′) and NdeIOmpATEMF (5′-CACACACACATATGAAAAAGACAGCTATCGCGATTGCAGTGGCACTGGCTGGTTTCGCTACCGTAGCGCAGGCCCACCCAGAAACGCTGGTGAAA-3′), a 95-bp forward primer containing both the NdeI restriction site and the ompA leader sequence. The resulting recombinant ompA-TEM(Y105X) genes were sequentially digested with NdeI and PstI and cloned into NdeI/PstI-digested and shrimp alkaline phosphatase-treated pET-TEM-1 before electroporation into E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Colonies were individually picked after selection on Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin, and the sequence of each mutant was confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method with the Thermo Sequenase Cycle Sequencing kit from Upstate Biochemical Corp. using dye-labeled primers and a Li-Cor automated sequencer (Lincoln, NB). For protein expression purposes, DNA constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells and sequenced again. Expression and Purification of 15N-13C-Labeled WT and TEM-1(Y105X) Mutants—Uniformly 15N-13C-labeled TEM-1 samples were prepared using 15NH4 Cl and [13C]glucose as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources according to the following protocol. A 2-ml overnight culture of each BL21(DE3)/pET-TEM-1(Y105X) clone was used to inoculate 500 ml of M9 minimal medium containing 0.04 m Na2HPO4, 0.02 m KH2PO4, 0.02 m 15NH4Cl, 0.01 m NaCl, 0.3% [13C]glucose, 2 mm MgSO4, 2 μm FeCl3, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 μm ZnSO4, 0.5% thiamine, 2.5 mm betaine, and 30 μg/ml kanamycin. The proteins were expressed by propagating the host cells at 37 °C (250 rpm) to an A600 nm = 0.8 followed by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and addition of 15 μg/ml kanamycin for 16-18 h at 25 °C (250 rpm). After induction, cells were pelleted by centrifugation (30 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered using a 0.45-μm membrane filter prior to a 5-fold concentration using an 8400 stirred cell apparatus from Millipore (Nepean, Ontario, Canada) with an Ultracel Amicon YM-10 membrane (molecular mass cutoff 10,000 Da). After overnight dialysis at 4 °C against a 10 mm Bistris propane buffer (pH 6.6), purification of WT and TEM(Y105X) mutants was performed on an AöKTAexplorer chromatography system from GE Healthcare as reported previously (29Savard P.Y. Gagné; S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In all cases, purity was estimated to be higher than 95% by SDS-PAGE, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/electrospray ionization and yields were typically ∼50 mg/liter of pure protein for all TEM-1(Y105X) mutants. NMR Samples—For the acquisition of NMR spectra, WT and mutants Y105D, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105W were lyophilized after extensive dialysis against H2O. The enzymes were subsequently dissolved to a concentration of 0.8 mm in a 90% H2O, 10% 2H2O solution containing 4 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm 2,2-dimethylsilapentane-5-sulfonic acid for internal pH and chemical shift referencing, respectively. All experiments were performed at pH 6.6. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at 30 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 599.739 MHz equipped with a z axis gradient and a triple resonance cryoprobe. Two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HN(CO)CA, and three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH spectra (Biopack, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) together with assignments obtained for TEM-1 E28G (28Savard P.Y. Sosa-Peinado A. Levesque R.C. Makinen M.W. Gagné; S.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) were used to determine sequence-specific assignments for the polypeptide backbone of WT and mutant Y105W. Other mutants (Y105D, Y105G, and Y105N) were assigned by comparison using a combination of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC and three-dimensional HNCO spectra. 15N relaxation experiments were performed on WT and on the Y105D mutant using 15N-13C double-labeled samples for all experiments. 15N-T1 experiments were performed using sensitivity-enhanced inversion-recovery pulse sequence with pulsed field gradients developed by Kay and co-workers (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). 15N-T2 experiments were performed using the BioPack pulse sequence from Varian, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA) (33Zhu G. Xia Y.L. Nicholson L.K. Sze K.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 143: 423-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). An RF field strength of 6.579 kHz was used for the 15N 180° pulses in the CPMG sequence with an inter-pulse delay of 587 μs. Delay times were 10.9, 21.7, 43.5, 87.0, 173.9, 347.8, 695.7, 1391.3, and 1989.1 ms for T1 and 10, 30, 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, 150, and 190 ms for T2. {1H}-15N steady state NOEs were obtained by acquiring spectra with and without 1H saturation applied before the start of the experiments using a pulse sequence obtained from Kay and co-workers (32Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). A saturation time of 4 s was used for {1H}-15N NOE experiments. To eliminate the potential effect of sample or field homogeneity degradation over time on measured exponential decays, relaxation delays were acquired in an inter-leaved manner. For example, the acquisition order for the 15N-T2 relaxation experiments was 10, 50, 90, 130, 30, 70, 110, 150, and 190 ms (34Gagné; S.M. Tsuda S. Spyracopoulos L. Kay L.E. Sykes B.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 278: 667-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 35Tjandra N. Wingfield P. Stahl S. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—All NMR data were processed with NMRPipe/NMRDraw (36Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11559) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (37Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2678) Google Scholar). For relaxation experiments, 1H-15N spectra were processed using either a 90° or a 60° shifted sine apodization function in F2 (1H) and either a 90° or a 60° shifted sine-squared function in F1 (15N). The 90° processing was used for the great majority of residues, and the 60° processing allowed the separation of a few peaks exhibiting slight overlapping. Linear prediction was performed in F1 to extend the time domain by a factor of 1.5, and both dimensions were zero-filled to the next power of 2. For each 15N-T1 and 15N-T2 experiment, the spectrum with the shortest relaxation delay (highest intensities) was peak-picked with NMR-View, and each ellipse was manually adjusted to fit the peak. The same procedure was used for {1H}-15N NOE spectra. The 15N R1 and R2 relaxation rates were determined by fitting T1 and T2 curves to a two-parameter exponential decay of the form shown in Equation 1, V(t)=V0e(−Rt) where V(t) is the volume after a delay time t; V0 is the volume at time t = 0; and R is either R1 = 1/T1 or R2 = 1/T2. Fitting was accomplished using the program CURVEFIT (AG Palmer, Columbia University). R1 and R2 uncertainties were calculated using Jackknife simulations (63Quenouille M. J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B. 1949; 11: 18-84Google Scholar), and for each data set the minimum error used for further calculation was set to the mean error. {1H}-15N NOE values were obtained from the ratio of the volumes of experiments recorded with and without proton saturation. The uncertainties on the {1H}-15N NOE values were obtained using the method described by Nicholson et al. (38Nicholson L.K. Kay L.E. Baldisseri D.M. Arango J. Young P.E. Bax A. Torchia D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5253-5263Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Model-free—The internal motion parameters were optimized for the relaxation data according to the model-free formalism pioneered by Lipari and Szabo (39Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4559-4570Crossref Scopus (1872) Google Scholar, 40Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Crossref Scopus (3398) Google Scholar) and extended by Clore et al.

Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Crossref Scopus (970) Google Scholar) using the program ModelFree 4.16 (AG Palmer, Columbia University) and the statistical approach of Mandel et al. (43Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. II I J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). An axially symmetric diffusion model was used in our analysis. Initial estimates of the global tumbling parameters were obtained using the program QUADRIC (AG Palmer, Columbia University). Residues with {1H}-15N NOE <0.65 were not considered, and neither were residues with high R2 (R2 ≥ σR2 〈+ σR2), unless their corresponding R1 values were low (R1 ≤ σR1 〈- σR1) (44Pawley N.H. Wang C. Koide S. Nicholson L.K. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 149-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The value used for 15N chemical shift anisotropy was -172 ppm and the N-H bond length was set to 1.02 Aå. For each simulation, 500 randomly distributed data sets were generated, and discrimination between models was performed using F-statistics analysis. The five models used to describe the spin-relaxation data were as follows: model 1, S2; model 2; S2, τe; model 3, S2, Rex; model 4, S2, τe, Rex; and model 5, S2, τe, S2f, where S2 is the order parameter used to characterize the amplitude of the internal motions on the ps-ns time scale. S2 is a measure of the degree of spatial restriction of the 1H-15N bond vector and has values ranging from 0, indicating unrestricted motions, to 1, for completely restricted motions; S2f is the order parameter for fast motions; τe is the effective correlation time for internal motions; and Rex is an exchange term to account for contributions to R2 from μs-ms time scale motions. Estimation of the Tyr105 Ring Current Effects and Prediction of Chemical Shift Changes Induced by the Mutation—Ring current effects of the Tyr105 aromatic group on the chemical shifts of other residues were estimated using the program SHIFTS (version 4.1.1) (45Xu X.P. Case D.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) for TEM-1 with Tyr105 positioned in two alternate conformations (positions A and B). Position A places Tyr105 as observed in the free-enzyme conformation of TEM-1 (Protein Data Bank, Brookhaven National Laboratory; PDB coordinates 1BTL) (46Jelsch C. Mourey L. Masson J.M. Samama J.P. Proteins. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas position B places Tyr105 as observed in the imipenem-bound flipped conformation (PDB coordinates 1BT5) (47Maveyraud L. Mourey L. Kotra L.P. Pedelacq J.D. Guillet V. Mobashery S. Samama J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9748-9752Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Minimized PDB files were created using the InsightII package, version 2000.1 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA) according to the following protocol. For position A, the 1.8-Aå crystallographic structure of the E. coli TEM-1 β-lactamase (PDB coordinates 1BTL) was used as starting coordinates. The crystallographic water molecules and the active-site SO4 molecule were deleted, and hydrogen atoms were added at the normal ionization state of the amino acids at pH 7.0. The structure was energy-minimized by applying 1000 steps of steepest descent followed by a conjugate gradient minimization until convergence of 0.001 kcal mol-1 Aå-1. For position B, backbone atoms of 1BTL and 1BT5 were superimposed, and the Tyr105 side chain of 1BTL was repositioned according to Tyr105 in 1BT5 by applying χ1 and χ2 angle torsions. The structure was then minimized using the same protocol as for position A. The contribution of Tyr105 to ring current shifts was estimated with all aromatic residues mutated to Ala, except for Tyr105. SHIFTS was also used to predict the effect of the mutation on chemical shifts of other residues of the protein. Observed chemical shift changes were considered meaningful when they were significantly greater than the predicted ones. Sequence Numbering—Because of technical requirements in NMR analysis, sequence numbering used for TEM-1 and mutants Y105X is different from the classical nomenclature proposed by Ambler et al. (48Ambler R.P. Coulson A.F. Frére J.M. Ghuysen J.M. Joris B. Forsman M. Levesque R.C. Tiraby G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 269-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Although sequence numbering starts at 26 to give the active-site serine residue the number 70, residues 239 and 253 are not skipped, and the numbering is sequential from 26 to 288. To avoid any confusion in catalytic and structural interpretation, both nomenclatures are appropriately labeled. 15N-13C-Labeled proteins corresponding to mutants Y105D, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105W of TEM-1 β-lactamase were expressed and purified to homogeneity. These mutants were chosen based on the following structural and functional considerations: Trp because of its aromatic similarity with the native Tyr, the native-like activity of mutant Y105W toward penicillins and cephalosporins, and also because of its frequent occurrence in other class A β-lactamases; Asn because its side chain is much smaller than the native, aromatic Tyr although still being a highly active mutant also occasionally represented in other class A β-lactamases; Gly because, like Ala, it exhibits discrimination with respect to penicillins (high catalytic efficiency) and cephalosporins (low catalytic efficiency); and Asp as a representative of a low activity mutant despite its structural similarity with the highly active Asn mutant (25Doucet N. De Wals P.Y. Pelletier J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46295-46303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Chemical Shift Differences—Although our previous NMR studies of TEM-1 were carried on the E28G mutant (28Savard P.Y. Sosa-Peinado A. Levesque R.C. Makinen M.W. Gagné; S.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 29: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 29Savard P.Y. Gagné; S.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 11414-11424Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), this study was performed without this mutation, and assignments of WT TEM-1 were used (Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank accession number 6357). A combination of two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC, three-dimensional HNCO, three-dimensional HN(CO)CA, and three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH spectra (Biopack, Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) were used to sequentially assign nearly all the backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C′ atoms (BMRB numbers for Y105W, Y105G, Y105N, and Y105D are 7236, 7237, 7238, and 7239, respectively). More than 99% of backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C′ assignments were obtained for non-proline residues of each enzyme"
https://openalex.org/W2015877926,"Eimeria tenella, in common with other parasitic protozoa of the phylum Apicomplexa, invades host cells using an actinomyosin-powered ""glideosome"" complex and requires the secretion of adhesive proteins from the microneme organelles onto the parasite surface. Microneme proteins of E. tenella include EtMIC4, a transmembrane protein that has multiple thrombospondin type I domains and calcium-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains in its extracellular domain, and EtMIC5, a soluble protein composed of 11 tandemly repeated domains that belong to the plasminogen-apple-nematode superfamily. We show here that EtMIC4 and EtMIC5 interact to form an oligomeric, ultrahigh molecular mass protein complex. The complex was purified from lysed parasites by non-denaturing techniques, and the stoichiometry was shown to be [EtMIC4](2):[EtMIC5](1), with an octamer of EtMIC4 bound non-covalently to a tetramer of EtMIC5. The complex is formed within the parasite secretory pathway and is maintained after secretion onto the surface of the parasite. The purified complex binds to a number of epithelial cell lines in culture. Identification and characterization of this complex contributes to an overall understanding of the role of multimolecular protein complexes in specific interactions between pathogens and their hosts during infection."
https://openalex.org/W1963866492,"Cathepsin K, the main bone degrading protease, and chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S) form a complex with enhanced collagenase activity. In this report, we demonstrate the specific inhibition of the collagenase activity of cathepsin K by negatively charged polymers without affecting the overall proteolytic activity of the protease. Three different mechanisms to interfere with cathepsin-catalyzed collagen degradation are discussed: 1) inhibition of the formation of the cathepsin K/C4-S complex, 2) inhibition of the attachment of C4-S to collagen, and 3) masking of the collagenase cleavage sites in collagen. By targeting these interaction sites, collagen degradation can be modulated while the non-collagenolytic activities of cathepsin K remain intact. The main inhibitory effect on collagen degradation is due to the impeding effect on the active cathepsin K/C4-S complex. Essential structural elements in the inhibitor molecules are negative charges which compete with the sulfate groups of C4-S in the cathepsin K/C4-S complex. The inhibitory effect can be controlled by length and charge of the polymers. Longer negatively charged polymers (e.g. polyglutamates, oligonucleotides) tend to inhibit all three mechanisms, whereas shorter ones preferentially affect the cathepsin K/C4-S complex.

Based on the physiological role of cathepsin K in bone resorption, cathepsin K inhibitors are being developed for the treatment of osteoporosis (7.Yamashita D.S. Dodds R.A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2000; 6: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Those inhibitors may also serve as drugs for rheumatoid arthritis (8.Yasuda Y. Kaleta J. Bromme D. Adv. Drug Delivery Rev. 2005; 57: 973-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Presently, conventional cathepsin K inhibitors target the active site, thus causing a complete inhibition of enzymatic activity. An active site inhibition is associated with the loss of other physiological functions of cathepsin K activity which may result in undesirable side effects. Ablation of the matrix-degrading function in tandem with preservation of its non-collagenolytic protease activity would be greatly advantageous and will be addressed in this report. Collagen consists of three intertwining α-chains of ∼1000 residues each (9.Ramachandran G.N. Kartha G. Nature. 1955; 176: 593-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures of triple-helical collagen and cathepsin K suggest that the active cleft of cathepsin K does not provide sufficient space to accommodate intact triple-helical collagen. The entrance to the catalytic site of cathepsin K is only 5 Å wide (10.McGrath M.E. Klaus J.L. Barnes M.G. Bromme D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), while triple-helical collagen has a diameter of 15 Å. This leads to the assumption that prior to hydrolysis by cathepsin K, the triple-helical collagen has to be unwound to expose its single chains. It was recently demonstrated that bone- and cartilage-resident glycosaminoglycans such as chondroitin sulfate (C4-S) 2The abbreviations used are: C4-S, chondroitin sulfate A; C4-S*, fluorescent tagged chondroitin sulfate A; CatK, cathepsin K; CatL, cathepsin L; cathepsin K4/C4-S1, complex of CatK and C4-S of a 4:1 ratio; DTT, dithiothreitol; E3 to E250, polyglutamate of 3-250 residues; E-64, l-3-carboxy-trans-2,3-epoxypropionyl-leucyl-amido-(4-guanidino)butane; FP, fluorescence polarization. enhance degradation of type I collagens by cathepsin K (11.Li Z. Hou W.S. Bromme D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), suggesting a specific interaction between C4-S and cathepsin K. These glycosaminoglycans are released as peptidyl glycosaminoglycans by cathepsin activity from proteoglycans such as aggregan and can subsequently form the complex (12.Hou W.S. Li Z. Buttner F.H. Bartnik E. Bromme D. Biol. Chem. 2003; 384: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In a previous report the formation of an oligomeric cathepsin K/C4-S complex has been described (13.Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The existence of a collagenolytically active cathepsin K/C4-S complex offers a new target and a novel approach to inhibit excessive bone degradation. We assume that compounds which specifically interfere with the formation of an active cathepsin K/C4-S complex and/or its binding to collagen would only inhibit collagen breakdown without affecting the proteolytic function of the enzyme. In this report, we also introduce a novel method using fluorescence polarization (FP) to discover compounds which are capable of selectively inhibiting the collagenase function of cathepsin K. The FP technique allows both the study of the carbohydrate-protein interaction which takes place in the formation of an active cathepsin K/C4-S complex, as well as the binding of the complex to collagen. The impact of a disturbed carbohydrate-protein interaction (e.g. cathepsin K/C4-S complex) on collagen breakdown is elucidated by an in vitro collagen degradation assay. The selectivity of potential inhibitors with respect to collagen degradation is confirmed by the unabated proteolytic activity of the protease toward gelatin. Based on findings presented in this report, we propose novel drug design strategies for cathepsin K mediated bone degradation. Chondroitin 4-sulfate (C4-S) and polyamino acids were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, Ontario, Canada) with the exception of polyglutamates of 3-20 residues (E3 to E20), which were synthesized using standard automated peptide synthesis methods. Briefly, peptides Glu3, Glu5, and Glu20 were prepared on an ABI 431A synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Roissy, France), using a 4-(2′,4′-dimethoxyphenyl-Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-aminomethylphenoxyacetamido-norleucyl)-4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem, VWR International, Pessac, France), while Glu10, Glu11, Glu12, Glu13, Glu14, and Glu15 were prepared on an automated solid phase peptide synthesizer (Pioneer, Applied Biosystems) using a PAL-PEG-PS resin (Applied Biosystems) and tetramethylfluoroformamidium hexafluorophosphate as activator in the presence of diisopropylethylamine according to the procedure reported elsewhere (14.Godat E.

Type I collagen (calf skin) was obtained from United States Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH. Oligonucleotides of different length and sequence were obtained from the NAPS Unit at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The cathepsin K complex was generated by mixing purified human cathepsin K and C4-S in 1/1 or 4/1 molar ratios in 100 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 1 mm EDTA. Wild-type human cathepsin K was expressed in Pichia pastoris and purified according to a previous report (15.Linnevers C.J. McGrath M.E. Armstrong R. Mistry F.R. Barnes M. Klaus J.L. Palmer J.T. Katz B.A. Brömme D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 919-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). (I) Activation of C4-S−17 mg of cyanogen bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) in 200 μl of water was added into 1 ml of C4-S (24 mg/ml). The pH was adjusted to 11.0 with ∼20 μl of 5 m NaOH. The mixture was applied to a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare). C4-S was eluted with 200 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0), and C4-S fractions of 0.2-0.5 ml were collected. The combined activated C4-S fractions were dissolved in ∼2.5-5.0 ml of sodium borate solution. The concentration of C4-S was determined using the Blyscan Glycosaminoglycan Assay kit (Biocolor Ltd., Newtownabbey, Northern Ireland). (II) Coupling with Fluoresceinamine−2-2.5 ml of activated C4-S was mixed with 400 μl of fluoresceinamine (Sigma-Aldrich) (10 mg/ml) in 200 mm sodium borate (pH 8.0). The mixture was kept at 4 °C overnight. Then, the mixture (about 3 ml) was concentrated to ∼1 ml by evaporating under vacuum at room temperature. Subsequently, the mixture was applied to a PD-10 column and eluted with 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.5). C4-S* fractions were collected. The first peak corresponded to fluoresceinamine-labeled C4-S, and the second peak was the free fluoresceinamine. The concentration of the fluoresceinamine labeled C4-S was determined via the Blyscan Glycosaminoglycan Assay. 20 nm C4-S* was incubated with various concentrations of cathepsin K (0-200 nm) and cathepsin L (0-125 nm) (was produced in P. pastoris) 3D. Brömme, unpublished data. for 20 min and measured at 37 °C (FPcatK/C4-S*). The measurement of the fluorescence polarization was carried out in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. The complex solution was excited at 485 nm and the fluorescence polarization was quantified at 520 nm. All measurements were conducted in a total volume of 100 μl in a 96-well plate using fluorescence polarimeter Fluostar optima (BMG LABTECH, Offenburg, Germany). The relationship between protease concentration and FP was plotted and analyzed using non-regression analysis. The plotted fluorescence polarization (FP = FPcatK/C4-S* - FPC4-S*) was calculated by subtracting the blank FPC4-S* from FPcaK/C4-S*. The blank FPC4-S* corresponds to 20 nm fluorescence-tagged C4-S measured at 37 °C. Potential inhibitors of the complex formation such as polyamino acids and oligonucleotides of different chain lengths were added at various concentrations to the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex (20 nm). The change of the fluorescence polarization was monitored (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). The collagen/C4-S complex was generated by combining 0.05 mg/ml collagen and 20 nm C4-S*. Polyamino acids (poly-dl-Ala, poly-d-Lys, poly-l-Lys, poly-l-Asp, poly-d-Glu, poly-l-Glu) and oligonucleotides of different chain lengths were added to the collagen/C4-S* complex, and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min. The change of the fluorescence polarization was monitored (excitation, 485 nm; emission, 520 nm). 0.6 mg/ml type I collagen collagen was incubated with cathepsin K (200 nm) and C4-S (200 nm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. The collagen digest was performed at 28 °C in the absence or presence of NaCl, different polyamino acids, or oligonucleotides in a total volume of 30 μl. The degradation reaction was stopped with E-64 (Sigma-Aldrich) after 4 or 5 h. The degradation mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris/glycine gels (Invitrogen). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue (Sigma-Aldrich). 0.6 mg/ml type I collagen was incubated with cathepsin L (2 μm) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5), containing 2.5 mm DTT and EDTA. The collagen digest was performed at 28 °C in the presence and absence of different polyamino acids, and with random sequence oligonucleotides in a total volume of 30 μl. The degradation reaction was stopped with E-64 after 9 h and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4-20% Tris/glycine gels. 0.4 mg/ml heat-denatured type I collagen (gelatin) was incubated with 2 nm cathepsin K for 4 h at 28 °C. The gelatin degradation was performed in the presence of oligonucleotides of 15- to 30-mers (random sequence), poly-l-Asp, poly-l-Lys, and poly-dl-Ala. All measurements were performed in 2 or more replicates, and error bars represent the standard deviations from at least two independent experiments. FP is a method allowing the evaluation of the binding between a molecule of small molecular mass and an acceptor molecule due to their molecular movement in solution (16.Jameson D.M. Seifried S.E. Methods. 1999; 19: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Besides protein-protein interactions (16.Jameson D.M. Seifried S.E. Methods. 1999; 19: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), FP can be applied to the analysis of carbohydrate-protein interactions (17.Ingham K.C. Brew S.A. Migliorini M.M. Busby T.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12548-12553Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, we applied FP on the analysis of the carbohydrate-protein interaction between C4-S and cathepsin K or collagen and monitored the displacement of C4-S from the cathepsin K/C4-S complex by potential inhibitors. Binding Studies of Cathepsin K and Cathepsin L to C4-S*−A concentration-dependent change in polarization was found for cathepsin K and C4-S*. As cathepsin K (0-200 nm) was gradually added to 20 nm C4-S*, the polarization value increased (Fig. 1A). Since fluorescence polarization is considered to be proportional to the molecular size, an increasing polarization indicates the binding of cathepsin K to C4-S*. Saturation of the polarization signal was reached at 160-200 nm cathepsin K in the presence of 20 nm C4-S*, suggesting the average binding of 8-10 cathepsin K molecules to 1 molecule C4-S*. In contrast to cathepsin K, addition of 0-125 nm cathepsin L to 20 nm C4-S* did not significantly alter the polarization signal of free C4-S*, signifying that cathepsin L did not interact with C4-S* (Fig. 1B). For subsequent inhibitor experiments, the binding curve of cathepsin K to C4-S* was evaluated with respect to cathepsin K/C4-S* ratios versus FP values. A high FP value of the cathepsin K/C4-S complex is required to receive a significant signal response as the complex is inhibited. At a 1/1 ratio, the protease-C4-S complex produced only a low polarization signal (Fig. 1A, ↕ a) and consequently a low signal response when inhibited. A stronger FP value was obtained at a 4/1 ratio between cathepsin K and C4-S* (Fig. 1A, ↕ b) leading consistently to a signal response as an inhibitor was added. Therefore, the following experiments for inhibitor screening have been carried out using a cathepsin K/C4-S* ratio of 4:1 (cathepsin K4/C4-S*1). Inhibition of the Cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 Complex−The goal of this study was to find inhibitors which selectively target the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K without affecting its proteolytic activity. C4-S is a long, unbranched polymer consisting of the repeating disaccharide unit of β-glucuronic acid-(1,3)-N-acetyl-β-galactosamine, which contains numerous negative charges (-SO2-4 and -COO-). A putative inhibitor of the complex should possess similar physicochemical properties to compete with C4-S in the complex. In the following we describe the inhibitory effects of various polyamino acids and oligonucleotides. Polyamino Acids−Polyamino acids of different physicochemical properties were studied with respect to their inhibitory effect on the collagenolytically active cathepsin K/C4-S complex (Fig. 2A). A selection of neutral and positively and negatively charged polyamino acids was chosen to explore the significance of charge in a putative inhibitor molecule. To determine whether the absolute configuration of the polyamino acid plays a role in the specific carbohydrate-protein interaction, a set of optical antipodes of poly-Lys and poly-Glu was included in the experiment. 20 nm cathepsin K4/C4-S1* was incubated with 0.5 μm polyamino acid for 20 min. The polarization was measured according to the experimental section and compared with the polarization value of the intact cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex, which was taken as 100%. The FP assay revealed that negatively charged polyamino acids (poly-Asp and poly-Glu) cause a strong decrease in the polarization signal indicating an inhibition of the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex, whereas larger size 32.6-38-kDa poly-d- and poly-l-Glu show a slightly stronger effect than 10 kDa poly-l-Asp. The same magnitude of inhibition was found for poly-d- and poly-l-Glu underlining the marginal role of the absolute configuration in the displacement of C4-S. Positively charged polyamino acids led to a statistically unchanged FP signal as found for poly-l-Lys and poly-d-Lys. No effect on the complex was found for neutral poly-dl-Ala, which is presumably due to a lack of charges in the molecule (Fig. 2A). The identical set of polyamino acids was applied to the in vitro collagen degradation assay (Fig. 2B) to study whether the complex-inhibitory properties is associated with a suppressing effect on the collagenase function of cathepsin K. In this experiment, poly-Asp and poly-Glu showed a strong inhibition of the collagen degradation which correlates to the inhibitory effect that we observed on the complex. In the presence of poly-Asp and poly-Glu, monomeric α-chains were generated, at the expense of the dimeric β- and trimeric γ-chains, which is due to a cleavage of telopeptides in collagen. This cleavage within non-helical telopeptides is characteristic for cysteine proteases and also evidence for the unimpeded proteolytic activity of cathepsin K. When incubating type I collagen with the active cathepsin K/C4-S complex in the absence of inhibitors (poly-Asp and poly-Glu), the degradation pattern shows a ladder of low molecular weight fragments. An intriguing result was obtained for positively charged poly-l-Lys, which is capable of moderately inhibiting collagen degradation despite having no effect on the cathepsin K/C4-S complex as demonstrated in the FP assay. Neutral poly-dl-Ala did not affect collagen degradation. Chain Length of Poly-l-Glu Versus Inhibitory Effect−To address the significance of polyamino acids chain length in the process of complex inhibition (Fig. 3A) and collagen degradation (Fig. 3B), the effect of poly-l-Glu of increased chain length (3-60 residues) was examined. For this experiment, poly-l-Glu solutions of equal percentage (0.001%) were used. This ensured that the amount of glutamate residues, regardless of whether they were part of longer or shorter chains, was kept constant while only the chain length varied. This allowed a direct comparison of shorter and longer poly-Glu specimens. The results show that poly-Glu consisting of 3-10 residues (E3 to E10) did not significantly affect the complex formation of cathepsin K4/C4-S*1. At least 15 residues (E15) were required to partially inhibit the complex formation and 60 residues were sufficient to suppress its formation almost completely (Fig. 3A). The effect of chain length is probably also the reason that both poly-l-Glu and poly-d-Glu were more effective than poly-l-Asp as the later polymer had a three to four times lower molecular weight than the poly-Glu derivatives (Fig. 2A). In the collagen degradation assay we found that the inhibition of the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex correlated directly to the inhibition of collagen degradation by cathepsin K (Fig. 3, A and B). Only polyglutamates of 15 or more residues exhibited an inhibition of collagen degradation, resulting in the preservation of undigested α1 and α2 bands and only a few low molecular weight degradation products. Incubation of the protease-C4-S complex with 20-mer or larger oligomers did not generate any collagen fragments, suggesting a complete inhibition of the triple-helical collagenase activity of the protease complex and its dependence from the chain length of the inhibitory specimen. Study of Chain Length and Sequence of Oligonucleotides−Oligonucleotides of varying chain lengths (5-, 15-, 25-, and 30-mer) and sequence (random or arbitrarily defined ATCTG repeats) were studied regarding their potency to inhibit the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex formation as well as its associated collagen degradation. Based on the poly-Glu experiments, the total number of mononucleotide building blocks was kept constant in the oligonucleotide solutions, while only the chain length varied. Analogous to the poly-Glu specimens, oligonucleotides were found to interfere with the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex formation (Fig. 4A) and collagen degradation (Fig. 4B) with respect to their increasing chain length (5-mer < 15-mer < 25-mer < 30-mer). Oligonucleotides of both, defined ATCTG-repeating and random, sequences complied with the rule of the chain length versus inhibitory effect, with no major difference in the magnitude of inhibition between the sequence-defined and randomized specimens based on the FP assay. Interestingly, the randomized oligonucleotides of longer chain length revealed a somewhat different pattern of collagen fragments in the collagenase assay. This may indicate an additional inhibitory effect independent from the inhibition of the cathepsin K/C4-S complex formation. Dose Dependence−The concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of oligonucleotides was studied with the 30-mer. The study showed that an increasing concentration of the 30-mer oligonucleotide was associated with an increasing inhibition of complex formation (Fig. 5A). In the collagen degradation assay we obtained a significant inhibition with a 50-fold molar excess of the 30-mer oligonucleotide (10 μm 30-mer oligonucleotide/200 nm cathepsin K), which is comparable with the findings derived from the polarization studies (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, at lower concentrations of the 30-mer oligonucleotide, the effect on collagen degradation weakened whereas the oligonucleotide retained its potency to displace C4-S from cathepsin K at those low concentrations (Fig. 5A). Collagen/C4-S Interaction; Influence of Polyamino Acids and Oligonucleotides−Since C4-S can potentially interact with positive charges present on collagen, the effect of polyamino acids and oligonucleotides was also tested on the collagen/C4-S binding using the FP assay. Preliminary polarization data for a mixture of type I collagen and C4-S* (data not shown) confirmed a binding of C4-S to type I collagen. For the FP competition assay a collagen/C4-S ratio similar to the in vitro collagen degradation assay was chosen, using 20 nm C4-S and 0.05 mg/ml type I collagen. To compare the results for the collagen/C4-S interaction (C of Figs. 2, 3 and 4) with the cathepsin K/C4-S interaction (A of Figs. 2, 3 and 4), identical concentrations of polyamino acids (0.001%) and oligonucleotides (0.00045%) were used in both competition experiments. An impeding effect on the collagen/C4-S interaction was observed for negatively charged polyamino acids such as poly-l-Asp and poly-l-Glu (Fig. 2C) and for oligonucleotides (Fig. 4C). Analogous to the cathepsin K/C4-S competition experiments, the inhibitory effect of poly-Glu (Fig. 3C) and oligonucleotides (Fig. 4C) depends on charge and chain length. However, the ability of poly-Glu and oligonucleotides to inhibit the collagen/C4-S complex is apparently lesser when compared with the cathepsin K/C4-S complex (C and A of Figs. 2, 3 and 4). The competive binding of the charged ligands to both cathepsin K and collagen may affect the overall potency of the ligands to inhibit the degradation of collagen. This may explain why in the absence of collagen, the 30-mer oligonucleotide sufficiently inhibits the formation of the cathepsin K/C4-S complex at low ligand concentration whereas the inhibition in the collagen degradation assay is decreased (Fig. 5, A and B). Interestingly, positively charged poly-l-Lys interferes with the collagen/C4-S binding which is, in magnitude, similar to poly-l-Asp (Fig. 2C), while the cathepsin K/C4-S complex is not affected (Fig. 2A). Gelatinolytic Activity of Cathepsin K in the Presence of Potential Inhibitors−To verify that the tested molecules do not inhibit the collagenolytic activity by interacting with the active site of the enzyme, the proteolytic activity of cathepsin K was examined by degrading gelatin in the presence of polyamino acids and oligonucleotides. Heat-treated type I collagen (gelatin) was incubated with 2 nm cathepsin K in the presence or absence of 5 μm 15- to 30-mers of oligonucleotides with random sequence and a representative for each type of polyamino acid (negatively charged poly-l-Asp, positively charged poly-l-Lys, neutral poly-dl-Ala). The gelatin degradation assay revealed that the fragmentation pattern of gelatin generated by cathepsin K in the presence or absence of all tested compounds was very similar, leaving only small traces of undigested gelatin (Fig. 6). Consequently, neither of the tested compounds had an effect on the general proteolytic activity of cathepsin K. Characterization of the Cathepsin L Recognition Site on Collagen−To investigate whether a part of the observed in vitro inhibition of collagen degradation is due to a masking of collagenase cleavage sites on collagen by the tested inhibitors, the digest of collagen by cathepsin K would have to be carried out in the absence of C4-S. This is rather difficult due to the fact that commercially available collagen preparations of type I collagen contain ∼0.2 μg/ml C4-S (13.Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), which can always interact with cathepsin K to form an active complex. The complete removal of C4-S from collagen is difficult to achieve whith potentially denaturing the native triple-helical collagen structure. Therefore, cathepsin L was used as it does not interact with C4-S (Fig. 1A). Provided, a compound masks cathepsin L cleavage sites in collagen, the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin L should be abrogated. For this study, type I collagen was incubated without C4-S in the presence of polyamino acids of varying charge and length, as well as random sequence oligonucleotides. As cathepsin L has a significantly lower collagenolytic activity than cathepsin K (18.Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), we used a high concentration of cathepsin L (2 μm) in the cleavage assay and increased the digest time to 9 h. We found that only negatively charged compounds inhibited collagen degradation while neutral and positively charged polyamino acids showed no effect. The fragmentation pattern shows that the collagenase activity of cathepsin L vanished in the presence of negatively charged poly-l-Asp and poly-d- and poly-l-Glu (Fig. 7A). Regarding chain length, longer polymers (polyglutamate of 60 residues, 30-mer random sequence oligonucleotide) clearly inhibited cathepsin L-mediated degradation, whereas shorter chains (polyglutamate of 3 residues, 5-mer random sequence oligonucleotide) had no effect (Fig. 7B). Since none of the cathepsin L-inhibiting substances interfered with the active site of cathepsin L (no effect on gelatin degradation; data not shown), it can be concluded that they block the cleavage sites of cathepsin L in collagen. Cathepsin K is a very potent collagenase (18.Brömme D. Okamoto K. Wang B.B. Biroc S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2126-2132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) with the ability to cleave triple-helical collagens at multiple sites (5.Garnero P. Borel O. Byrjalsen I. Ferreras M. Drake F.H. McQueney M.S. Foged N.T. Delmas P.D. Delaisse J.M. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 331: 727-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that glycosaminoglycans such as C4-S can modulate the collagenolytic activity of cathepsin K (19.Li Z. Yasuda Y. Li W. Bogyo M. Katz N. Gordon R.E. Fields G.B. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5470-5479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and that it forms a collagenolytically active protease/C4-S complex (13.Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Exploiting the fluorescence polarization between labeled C4-S and cathepsin K, we demonstrated the binding of cathepsin K to C4-S. The cathepsin K molecule is characterized by a unique and high density of positively charged residues (Lys, Arg) located on the opposite side of the catalytic center (Fig. 8). Presumably, these positive charges allow for electrostatic interactions with negatively charged C4-S, contributing to the formation of the active complex. Contrary to cathepsin K, cathepsin L (which lacks comparable positively charged patches on it protein surface) does not interact with C4-S* in the FP assay emphasizing that positive charges on cathepsin K are involved in the binding with C4-S*. To inhibit the formation of a collagenolytically active complex between cathepsin K and C4-S, a selection of potential C4-S competitor compounds was tested. Molecules featuring similar ionic properties to C4-S were chosen as initial lead structures. Polymers of polyamino acids seemed to be appropriate candidates for studying the structural requirements for a potent complex inhibitor, with a focus on charge, absolute configuration and molecular size. The FP competition studies revealed that neither neutral (poly-Ala) nor positively charged polymers (poly-Lys) had an inhibitory effect on the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex. Apparently, only polymers carrying negative charges (-COO-), such as poly-Asp and poly-Glu, are capable of impeding the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex. These findings clearly revealed that negative charges are essential for competitively preventing the sulfate groups of C4-S from binding the positively charged surface residues on cathepsin K. The results also demonstrated that the nature of this interaction is mainly electrostatic. The configuration of the polyamino acids played no role in their inhibitory potential as no differences were found between d and l isomers. The significance of chain length in negatively charged polymers was investigated in more detail by testing poly-Glu species consisting of 5-60 residues. An unambiguous correlation between chain length and complex inhibition was found. This implies that besides negative charges, the size of the molecule is also relevant for the disruption of the active complex. For example, an inhibitory effect seen with 1 × E20 did not occur with 4 × E5. As the number of charges is the same in the 1 × E20 and 4 × E5, the inhibitory effect depends on the chain length. Interestingly, a size of at least 15 Glu residues (E15) is required to inhibit complex formation. A prediction of the secondary structure for poly-Glu of varying length based on an implementation of the Bayesian prediction formalism in the modeling program MOE (20.Thompson M.J. Goldstein R.A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1963-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) suggests a helix as a secondary structure for molecules sized E15 and above, which agrees with inhibitory potencies for complex inhibition. It can be speculated that the formation of a helix optimally organizes the spatial orientation of carboxylate groups for an efficient interaction with the Lys and Arg residues of cathepsin K, thus resulting in a potent complex inhibition. Analogous to poly-Glu, the inhibition profile of oligonucleotides revealed that the binding affinity, which is related to the size of oligonucleotides and their charges, is the defining factor for complex inhibition. Since there was no significant difference between the magnitude of complex inhibition for random and defined oligonucleotides, it can be ascertained that the sequence of oligonucleotides associated with a certain secondary structure plays a subordinate role to the protein-nucleotide interaction. By means of in vitro collagen degradation assays, we could confirm that an inhibition of the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 by negatively charged polyamino acids and oligonucleotides was consistently associated with a suppression of type I collagen degradation. As polyamino acids and oligonucleotides did not affect the proteolytic function of cathepsin K (as determined by the gelatin degradation assay, it can be concluded that (i) the tested polyamino acids and oligonucleotides do not block or interact with the active site of cathepsin K, (ii) the observed inhibition of collagen degradation mainly stems from an inhibition of the formation of an active cathepsin K/C4-S complex, and (iii) the degradation of noncollagenous proteins (such as gelatin) does not require a cathepsin K/C4-S complex, which confirms earlier findings (13.Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28669-28676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the cathepsin K/C4-S complex is required for the unfolding of the collagen triple-helix prior to the proteolytic cleavage of its alpha-chains. Thus, the prevention of complex formation or its maintenance would specifically preclude the unwinding of the collagen helix and thereby its subsequent hydrolysis. On the other hand, the inhibition of complex formation does not affect the catalytic site of the protease and thus does not inhibit the hydrolysis of non-helical substrate (11.Li Z. Hou W.S. Bromme D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13.Li Z. Hou W.S. Escalante-Torres C.R. Gelb B.D. Bromme D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 5470-5479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We have previously described that the collagenase activity of cathepsin L is inhibited in the presence of C4-S, while its proteolytic activity is not affected (19.Li Z. Yasuda Y. Li W. Bogyo M. Katz N. Gordon R.E. Fields G.B. Bromme D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5470-5479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, as shown in this report, no complex formation between C4-S and cathepsin L was observed. This raises the question at which stage C4-S interferes with cathepsin L-mediated collagen degradation. Potentially, C4-S could prevent the binding of cathepsin L to collagen by binding to collagen itself and disguising the putative binding site for cathepsin L. This proposed collagen/C4-S binding has been demonstrated by chromatographic experiments by others (21.Obrink B. Wasteson A. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Ionic association takes place between negatively charged groups on the C4-S and positively charged groups on collagen. Consequently, C4-S could on one hand prevent the binding of cathepsin L to collagen and on the other hand may enhance the binding of cathepsin K by acting as a linker between collagen and the protease. This would effectively increase the local concentration of cathepsin K on the surface of collagen. In general, we have observed that compounds which impeded the cathepsin K4/C4-S*1 complex were also able to interfere with the binding of C4-S* to collagen. This is not surprising given the electrostatic nature of the binding between collagen and C4-S. The inhibitory effect of negatively charged polymers on the collagen/C4-S interaction was consistently weaker than on the cathepsin K/C4-S interaction. Due to the large surface area of collagen relative to cathepsin K, we can assume that the interaction between collagen/C4-S is stronger than that of cathepsin K/C4-S, which could explain the weaker overall inhibitory effect on collagen/C4-S interaction. To further address the possibility of inhibitors masking the collagen surface and thus preventing its enzymatic degradation, the collagen degradation assay was performed with cathepsin L in the presence of poly-Glu and oligonucleotides. In this experiment, we discovered that negatively charged polymers (poly-Asp, poly-Glu, oligonucleotides) strongly inhibited cathepsin l-mediated collagen degradation. The magnitude of inhibition can be modulated by the length of the polymer (polyglutamates: 3 residues < 60 residues, random sequence oligonucleotide: 5-mer < 30-mer). Since the proteolytic activity of cathepsin L (gelatin degradation) was not affected at all, we can conclude that (i) the observed inhibition of cathepsin L-mediated collagen degradation is not caused by inhibitor interference with the active site, and (ii) the inhibitors tested are capable of binding to the collagenase recognition site on collagen, thus suppressing its enzymatic degradation. It can be assumed that binding of negatively charged polymers occurs at positively charged groups in the triple-helical region of collagen via electrostatic interactions, similarly to C4-S. Interestingly, no inhibitor binding occurred in the region of the telopeptides, since their cleavage was not inhibited (as seen in the accumulation of α-collagen bands). The inhibition of cathepsin L-mediated collagen degradation indicated that the tested inhibitors were capable of binding to cathepsin L recognition sites on collagen. Although the cleavage sites in type I collagen by cathepsins L and K are not identical (5), we can deduce that the binding of these inhibitors to collagen also contributes to the inhibition in the cathepsin K-mediated collagen degradation. Of particular interest is poly-Lys, which exclusively disrupts the collagen/C4-S interaction. Positively charged side chains of poly-l-Lys may preferably bind to sulfate groups of C4-S, thus preventing the binding of C4-S to collagen. Since poly-l-Lys does not affect cathepsin l-mediated collagen degradation (Fig. 7A), it can be considered as a cathepsin K-specific inhibitor. In summary, selective inhibitors of collagen degradation can target three different inhibition sites without affecting the proteolytic function of the protease itself: (i) cathepsin K/C4-S interaction, (ii) collagen/C4-S(protease) interaction, and (iii) the protease cleavage sites on collagen (Scheme 1). This study also suggests that inhibitors may use more than one pathway of inhibition. This work demonstrates that it is possible to specifically inhibit the collagenase function of cathepsin K without affecting its proteolytic activity. In prospective work, we will focus on elucidating the structure of a cathepsin K/inhibitor complex by means of crystallographic studies. The structural knowledge of the binding site and mechanism of interaction of negatively charged polymers to cathepsin K will support the design of small molecular inhibitors which will be superior in their specificity when compared with classical active site-directed inhibitors as they specifically target the collagenase activity of this therapeutically important protease.

https://openalex.org/W1969944449,"High-affinity, sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter (NaDC3) is responsible for transport of Krebs cycle intermediates and may involve in regulation of aging and life span. Hydropathy analysis predicts that NaDC3 contains 11 or 12 hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) domains. However, the actual membrane topological structure of NaDC3 remains unknown. In this study, confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and membrane biotinylation of epitope-tagged N and C termini of NaDC3 provide evidence of an extracellular C terminus and an intracellular N terminus, indicating an odd number of transmembrane regions. The position of hydrophilic loops within NaDC3 was identified with antibodies against the loops domains combined with cysteine accessibility methods. A confocal image of membrane localization and transport activity assay of the cysteine insertion mutants show behavior similar to that of wild-type NaDC3 in transfected HEK293 cells, suggesting that these mutants retain a native protein configuration. We find that NaDC3 contains 11 transmembrane helices. The loops 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 face the extracellular side, and loops 2, 4, 6, and 10 face the cytoplasmic side. A re-entrant loop-like structure between TM8 and TM9 may protrude into the membrane. Our results support the topography of 11 transmembrane domains with an extracellular C terminus and an intracellular N terminus of NaDC3, and for the first time provide experimental evidence for a novel topological model for NaDC3."

Here, we report the characterization of a novel splice variant of human Siah-1, designated Siah-1S, which is produced by an alternative splicing mechanism. The novel intron/exon junctions used to generate Siah-1S follow a non-conventional CT-AC rule. Siah-1S exhibits an even shorter half-life than Siah-1 and is able to catalyse self-ubiquitination that results in its subsequent degradation by proteasome. Siah-1S is shown to upregulate β-catenin-dependent Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation and antagonize Siah-1's potentiation effect on the apoptosis induced by etoposide in MCF-7 cells. Additionally, Siah-1S is found to interact with Siah-1 to form heterodimer or with itself to form homodimer. Unlike homodimer Siah-1*Siah-1, neither Siah-1*Siah-1S nor Siah-1S*Siah-1S is able to bind to Siah-1-interacting protein, which may explain the underlying mechanism for Siah-1S's dominant negative effect on Siah-1.

Compelling evidence has accumulated that DNA replication of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes occurs in so-called replication factories, which probably contain, besides replicative DNA polymerases, all other enzymes involved in DNA replication and related processes (1.Hozak P.

Imaging techniques demonstrated that replication factories are located at rather static positions, implying that they are attached to subcellular structure(s) (reviewed in Ref. 4.Cook P.R.

Besides functioning as a scaffold, membrane association inherently compartmentalizes replicative complexes, allowing surface catalysis, which increases the efficiency of the DNA replication process (7.Lyle J.M. Bullitt E. Bienz K. Kirkegaard K. Science. 2002; 296: 2218-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 8.Cronan J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 57: 203-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Little is known, however, about proteins involved in the organization of membrane-associated replication of genomes. An exception is the well studied Bacillus subtilis phage ϕ29 (for a review, see Ref. 9.Meijer W.J.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The genome of ϕ29 consists of a linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) 3The abbreviations used are: dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; TP, terminal protein; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate. of 19,285 bp that contains a terminal protein (TP) covalently linked at each 5′-end. Initiation of ϕ29 DNA replication occurs via a so-called protein-primed mechanism (reviewed in Refs. 10.Salas M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar and 11.Salas M. Miller J.T. Leis J. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 131-176Google Scholar). The first step involves recognition of the origins of replication, constituted by the TP-containing DNA ends, by a ϕ29-encoded DNA polymerase/TP heterodimer. After origin recognition, the DNA polymerase catalyzes the covalent attachment of the first nucleotide to the TP molecule present in the heterodimer. Then, after a transition step, these two proteins dissociate, and the DNA polymerase continues processive elongation, which is coupled to strand displacement, until replication of the nascent DNA strand is completed. Membrane-associated ϕ29 DNA replication was first demonstrated by Ivarie and Pe`ne (12.Ivarie R.D. Pe`ne J.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 351-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), who also showed that this required early expressed ϕ29 proteins. The early expressed ϕ29 gene 16.7 is conserved in all ϕ29-related phages studied so far (9.Meijer W.J.J. Horcajadas J.A. Salas M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2001; 65: 261-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Protein p16.7 (130 amino acids) is a membrane protein, and its N-terminal transmembrane domain (residues 1-20) is responsible for membrane localization (13.Meijer W.J.J. Serna-Rico A. Salas M. Mol.

Biochemical studies using a soluble variant lacking the N-terminal membrane anchor, p16.7A, revealed (i) that it has single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA binding activity, (ii) that it is a dimer in solution, and (iii) that it can form oligomers, especially upon DNA binding (13.Meijer W.J.J.

Interestingly, one dsDNA binding subunit is constituted by three p16.7C dimers that are arranged in such a way that they form a deep dsDNA binding cavity. The structure of the p16.7C-DNA complex provided important insights into the DNA binding and oligomerization surfaces (18.Albert A. Muñoz-Espi´n D. Jiménez M. Asensio J.L. Hermoso J.A. Salas M.

Thus, each p16.7C monomer contains three α helices (corresponding to p16.7 residues 72-81 (H1), 88-95 (H2), and 103-121 (H3)) (see Fig. 1A), and the secondary and ternary structure of each monomer is stabilized by a hydrophobic core resulting from the packing of the three helices. Two monomers form a symmetric p16.7C dimer that corresponds to a novel six-helical fold (see Fig. 1, B and C). The primary dimer interface is formed by the third α-helix and the following extended C-terminal region (p16.7 residues 122-128) of each monomer, which are oriented in an antiparallel fashion and pack against helices H1 and H3 of the other monomer. The intermolecular interactions present in the primary dimer interface involve multiple hydrophobic and polar contacts. Based on their position within the interface, these can be grouped as central and lateral intermolecular contacts. Whereas residues that locate in the central part of the dimeric interface form part of the C-terminal region of the third α-helices, the extended C-terminal regions following this third α helix constitute the lateral interdimeric contacts. The major aims of this work were (i) to validate the role of residues at the central and lateral regions of the primary dimer interface and to analyze their relative importance for dimerization and (ii) to study whether dimerization is required for functionality of the protein. The results obtained show that the lateral regions of the dimer interface as well as residue Trp-116 present in the central region of the dimer interface are crucial for proper dimerization and functionality of the protein. Trp-116 most probably forms an essential part of a novel dimerization motif, which we named the “proline cage.” In addition, residue Asn-120, also present at the central dimer interface region, was studied. Although this residue was shown to be less important for dimerization, it appeared to be crucial for oligomerization and functionality of the protein.

After cross-linking, proteins were precipitated upon the addition of 1 volume of ice-cold 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and, after resuspension, analyzed by PAGE in the presence of SDS. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Gel Mobility Shift Assays−Gel retarding assays were performed as described before (14.Serna-Rico A. Muñoz-Espi´n D. Villar L. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DNase I Digestion Assays−Nuclease digestion assays were performed using end-labeled 297-bp DNA fragments corresponding to the ϕ29 right end genome. DNase I reactions contained, in 20 μl, besides the end-labeled dsDNA fragment and the indicated amount of protein, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 10 mm MgCl2. Binding reactions were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C before 0.05 units of DNase I (Promega) was added. Digestion was allowed to proceed for 2 min at 37 °C, after which the reaction was stopped upon the addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mm. A phenol/chloroform extraction step was performed before the DNA was precipitated with ethanol in the presence of 15 μg of linear polyacrylamide as carrier. Next, the resuspended DNA was analyzed in denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Finally, gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. CD and Intrinsic Trp Fluorescence Spectroscopy−FAR-UV CD spectra were recorded using a JASCO spectropolarimeter, model 600 (JASCO Europe SLR), equipped with a NESLAB RTE-100 water bath interfaced to a computer. Wavelength scans from 198 to 260 nm were performed at 25 °C using 1.0- and 0.1-cm path length cells (Thermal Syndicate Ltd., Wallsend, Northumberland, UK). Samples were allowed to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Each spectrum represents the mean of four scans obtained at a rate of 50 nm/min, a band-width of 1.0 nm, and a response time of 2 s. Samples were prepared in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, at protein concentrations of 2 or 20 μm. Thermal denaturation experiments were carried out, increasing the temperature from 4 to 90 °C at a scanning rate of 0.75 °C/min and monitoring the ellipticity measured at 222 nm. The buffer, cuvettes, and protein concentrations used were as in the wavelength scans. The reversibility of the thermal transition for p16.7C was checked by comparing the spectra obtained by denaturation of the native sample with that obtained by cooling the denatured sample. Fluorescence experiments were recorded using an AMINCO-BOWMAN (Runcorn, Chesire, UK) series-2 luminescence spectrometer equipped with a Selecta Ultraterm temperature control unit. Protein spectra were registered at 2 and 20 μm in 1-cm path length cells, from 310 to 450 nm using an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Blanks without protein were subtracted from the spectra. The melting curves were obtained measuring the intrinsic Trp fluorescence at 335 nm. Analyses of Spectroscopic Data−Most of the secondary structural analyses were performed using DICHROWEB (available on the World Wide Web at www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/cdweb), an interactive Web server (24.Lobley A. Wallace B.A. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 373aGoogle Scholar, 25.Lobley A. Withmore L. Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) that permits the secondary structure analyses via the software package CDPro (26.Sreerema N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Protein CD spectra were analyzed for percentages of secondary structure using CDPro software as CONTINLL (27.Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), SELCON3 (28.Sreerema N. Venyaminov S.Y. Woody R.W. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 370-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), and CDSSTR (29.Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) with a wide range of protein spectral databases derived from soluble and membrane proteins (26.Sreerema N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 30.Sreerema N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Thus, SELCON3, CONTINLL and CDSSTR programs were used for comparing variations in the amount of secondary structure observed in mutant proteins p16.7CΔ9, pW116A, and pN120W relative to that observed with protein p16.7C. As a means of comparison of the goodness of fit of the various methods, the normalized root mean square deviation parameter (31.Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 214968Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was calculated for all of the analyses. The normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) is defined by Equation 1,NRMSD=Σ(θexp-θcal)2θexp2 summed over all wavelengths, where θexp and θcal are, respectively, the experimental ellipticities and the ellipticities of the back-calculated spectra for the derived structure. Normalized root mean square deviation values of <0.1 mean that the back-calculated and experimental spectra are in close agreement (32.Brahms S. Brahms J. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 149-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation Assays−Sedimentation equilibrium was performed to determine the state of association of p16.7C and its derivatives as well as their DNA binding capacity. In the absence of DNA, the experiments, done over a broad range of protein concentrations (from 5 to 700 μm), were carried out at 20 °C using different speeds (15,000 and 20,000 rpm) and wavelengths (230, 250, 280, and 290 nm) with short columns (80-100 μl) in an XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman) equipped with a UV-visible optics detection system, using an An60Ti rotor and 12-mm double sector or six-hole Eponcharcoal centerpieces. All samples were in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.2 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine HCl. After the equilibrium scans, a high speed centrifugation run (40,000 rpm) was done to estimate the corresponding base-line offsets. Weight average buoyant molar masses of the proteins were determined by fitting data to a single species model using either a MATLAB program (kindly provided by Dr. Allen Minton, NIH) based on the conservation of signal algorithm (33.Minton A.P. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Birkhauser, Boston, MA1994: 81-93Crossref Google Scholar) or the HeteroAnalysis program (34.Cole J.L. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 384: 212-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); both analyses gave essentially the same results. The reported errors of the best fit molar masses correspond to two S.D. values (95% confidence limits). The corresponding protein molar masses were determined from the experimental buoyant masses using 0.734 ml/g as the partial specific volume of p16.7C (calculated from the amino acid composition using the SEDNTERP program) (35.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). Tracer sedimentation equilibrium (36.Rivas G. Minton A.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1015-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37.Howlett G.J. Minton A.P. Rivas G. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 430-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was used to determine the DNA binding capacity of p16.7C and its derivatives. In brief, a constant concentration (5 μm) of fluorescent fluorescein isothiocyanate 5′-end-labeled 12-mer oligonucleotide (5′-CCTGTGCACAGG-3′), alone or in the presence of increasing concentrations of p16.7C or one of its derivatives, was subjected to sedimentation equilibrium under the same conditions described above, except that the solute gradients were obtained at a wavelength (495 nm) in which only the fluorescently labeled DNA was detectable. From the analysis of these gradients (done as described above), the buoyant signal average molar masses (and hence the DNA binding capacity) of the different samples were determined. To estimate the complex binding stoichiometry in this case, the sedimentation equilibrium data of the mixtures were analyzed assuming the following linear approximation for the buoyant masses: bMw,ij = i(bMw,A) + j(bMw,B), where ij refers to the complex AiBj; i and j are the number of molecules of A (DNA) and B (protein p16.7C), respectively; and bMw,A and bMw,B are the buoyant molecular weights of pure A and pure B, respectively (38.Rivas G. Stafford W. Minton A.P. Methods. 1999; 19: 194-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further characterize the DNA binding process (in terms of stoichiometry, affinity, and degree of cooperativity), the dependence of the degree of protein p16.7C-DNA complex formation upon protein concentration can be described by the empirical Hill function: B(L) = Bmax(L/L50)n/(1 + (L/L50)n), where B(L) is the amount of protein p16.7C bound to the DNA at a given free concentration of protein (L), L50 is equal to half of the maximal binding capacity Bmax, and n is a cooperativity parameter (39.Hatters D.M. Minton A.P. Howlett G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7824-7830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Finally, the analysis of p16.7C binding to a longer 297-bp DNA fragment was carried out calculating the sedimentation equilibrium and the buoyant molar masses as described above. In this case, the differences in size between the protein and the DNA allow the design of low speed sedimentation equilibrium experiments to discriminate the gradients of DNA (free and complexed) and protein without labeling the DNA. Because the complexes formed were very large, a further analysis was performed by means of sedimentation velocity. The sedimentation velocity runs were carried out at 30,000 and 40,000 rpm and 20 °C using the same experimental conditions and instrument as in the sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Sedimentation profiles were registered every 5 min at 260 nm. The sedimentation coefficient distributions were calculated by modeling of sedimentation velocity data using the c(s) method (40.Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar), as implemented in the SEDFIT program, from which the corresponding sedimentation coefficients (s values) were obtained. The reported errors of the s values correspond to two S.D. values (95% confidence limits). Rationale of Mutants Constructed−Resolution of the solution and crystal structures of the p16.7C dimer revealed that the primary dimer interface is formed by the third α-helix and its following extended C-terminal region of each monomer, which are oriented in an antiparallel fashion and that pack against helices H1 and H3 of the other monomer (17.Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espi´n D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1B). Within the central region of this dimeric interface, residues Trp-116 and Asn-120 (see Fig. 1, A and C) were likely to be involved in p16.7C dimerization. Thus, the side chains of residue Pro-87 of each monomer, which are 4 Å apart at the dimer interface, pack against the indole rings of the Trp-116 residue of the opposite monomer (see Fig. 1B). This particular arrangement in which the side chains of two proline residues are “locked” between the indole rings of two opposing tryptophan residues resembles that of a so-called Trp cage motif in which the indole rings of tryptophan residues are locked by side chains of prolines (41.Neidigh J.W. Fesinmeyer R.M. Andersen N.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Residue Asn-120 forms three interdimeric hydrogen bonds. One of these is between the side chains of Asn-120 of each monomer. The other two interdimeric hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chains of Arg-113 of either monomer with the backbone of Asn-120 of the other monomer. The lateral regions of the dimeric interface are formed by the antiparallelly oriented extended C-terminal region of each monomer (p16.7 residues 122-130) that pack against helices H1 and H3 of the other monomer (see Fig. 1C). Although p16.7 residues 122-130 are not folded into an α-helical or β-sheet conformation, this region, except for the last two residues (positions 129 and 130), forms a stable and well defined extended structure both in the crystalline and solute form of the p16.7C dimer (17.Asensio J.L. Albert A. Muñoz-Espi´n D. Gonzalez C. Hermoso J. Villar L. Jiménez-Barbero J. Salas M. Meijer W.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 20730-20739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Most probably, the multiple polar and hydrophobic intermolecular interactions of residues in this region are responsible for this stable extended structure. To validate whether residues Trp-116 and Asn-120 and the extended C-terminal region are important for p16.7C dimerization and to analyze their relative contribution in dimerization, we have constructed single substitution mutants for residues Trp-116 (pW116A) and Asn-120 (pN120W) and constructed another mutant in which the last nine C-terminal residues of p16.7C are deleted (p16.7CΔ9). In pW116A, the indole ring interacting with the side chain of Pro-87 of the other monomer is absent and hence is expected to fully disrupt formation of the aromatic cage. Mutation of residue"
