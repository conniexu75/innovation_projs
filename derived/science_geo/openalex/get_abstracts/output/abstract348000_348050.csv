https://openalex.org/W1992425156,"The large archives of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens that exist are a highly valuable source of sample material for molecular biological analysis, including gene expression profiling. However, current data on adverse effects of standard pathological practice on the usefulness of biomolecular analytes obtained from such archived specimens is largely anecdotal. Here, we present a systematic examination of the most relevant parameters for integrity and useability of RNA obtained from FFPE samples, including storage time and conditions, fixation time, and specimen size. The results are particularly relevant for any application relying on cDNA synthesis as an initial step of the procedure, such as RT-PCR, and microarray analysis."

https://openalex.org/W1974449792,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS, OMIM 176670) is a rare disorder characterized by accelerated aging and early death, frequently from stroke or coronary artery disease. 90% of HGPS cases carry the LMNA G608G (GGC>GGT) mutation within exon 11 of LMNA, activating a splice donor site that results in production of a dominant negative form of lamin A protein, denoted progerin. Screening 150 skin biopsies from unaffected individuals (newborn to 97 years) showed that a similar splicing event occurs in vivo at a low level in the skin at all ages. While progerin mRNA remains low, the protein accumulates in the skin with age in a subset of dermal fibroblasts and in a few terminally differentiated keratinocytes. Progerin-positive fibroblasts localize near the basement membrane and in the papillary dermis of young adult skin; however, their numbers increase and their distribution reaches the deep reticular dermis in elderly skin. Our findings demonstrate that progerin expression is a biomarker of normal cellular aging and may potentially be linked to terminal differentiation and senescence in elderly individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2065542724,"The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a human pathogen relies on its ability to resist eradication by the immune system. The identification of mechanisms that enable Mtb to persist is key for finding ways to limit latent tuberculosis, which affects one-third of the world's population. Here we show that conditional gene silencing can be used to determine whether an Mtb gene required for optimal growth in vitro is also important for virulence and, if so, during which phase of an infection it is required. Application of this approach to the prcBA genes, which encode the core of the mycobacterial proteasome, revealed an unpredicted requirement of the core proteasome for the persistence of Mtb during the chronic phase of infection in mice. Proteasome depletion also attenuated Mtb in interferon-γ–deficient mice, pointing to a function of the proteasome beyond defense against the adaptive immune response. Genes that are essential for growth in vitro, in vivo or both account for approximately 20% of Mtb's genome. Conditional gene silencing could therefore facilitate the validation of up to 800 potential Mtb drug targets and improve our understanding of host-pathogen dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2134432161,"Background Feasibility of genotyping of hundreds and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of study subjects have triggered the need for fast, powerful, and reliable methods for genome-wide association analysis. Here we consider a situation when study participants are genetically related (e.g. due to systematic sampling of families or because a study was performed in a genetically isolated population). Of the available methods that account for relatedness, the Measured Genotype (MG) approach is considered the ‘gold standard’. However, MG is not efficient with respect to time taken for the analysis of genome-wide data. In this context we proposed a fast two-step method called Genome-wide Association using Mixed Model and Regression (GRAMMAR) for the analysis of pedigree-based quantitative traits. This method certainly overcomes the drawback of time limitation of the measured genotype (MG) approach, but pays in power. One of the major drawbacks of both MG and GRAMMAR, is that they crucially depend on the availability of complete and correct pedigree data, which is rarely available. Methodology In this study we first explore type 1 error and relative power of MG, GRAMMAR, and Genomic Control (GC) approaches for genetic association analysis. Secondly, we propose an extension to GRAMMAR i.e. GRAMMAR-GC. Finally, we propose application of GRAMMAR-GC using the kinship matrix estimated through genomic marker data, instead of (possibly missing and/or incorrect) genealogy. Conclusion Through simulations we show that MG approach maintains high power across a range of heritabilities and possible pedigree structures, and always outperforms other contemporary methods. We also show that the power of our proposed GRAMMAR-GC approaches to that of the ‘gold standard’ MG for all models and pedigrees studied. We show that this method is both feasible and powerful and has correct type 1 error in the context of genome-wide association analysis in related individuals."
https://openalex.org/W1969789782,"Clostridium botulinum and related clostridial species express extremely potent neurotoxins known as botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) that cause long-lasting, potentially fatal intoxications in humans and other mammals. The amino acid variation within the BoNT is used to categorize the species into seven immunologically distinct BoNT serotypes (A-G) which are further divided into subtypes. The BoNTs are located within two generally conserved gene arrangements known as botulinum progenitor complexes which encode toxin-associated proteins involved in toxin stability and expression.Because serotype A and B strains are responsible for the vast majority of human botulism cases worldwide, the location, arrangement and sequences of genes from eight different toxin complexes representing four different BoNT/A subtypes (BoNT/A1-Ba4) and one BoNT/B1 strain were examined. The bivalent Ba4 strain contained both the BoNT/A4 and BoNT/bvB toxin clusters. The arrangements of the BoNT/A3 and BoNT/A4 subtypes differed from the BoNT/A1 strains and were similar to those of BoNT/A2. However, unlike the BoNT/A2 subtype, the toxin complex genes of BoNT/A3 and BoNT/A4 were found within large plasmids and not within the chromosome. In the Ba4 strain, both BoNT toxin clusters (A4 and bivalent B) were located within the same 270 kb plasmid, separated by 97 kb. Complete genomic sequencing of the BoNT/B1 strain also revealed that its toxin complex genes were located within a 149 kb plasmid and the BoNT/A3 complex is within a 267 kb plasmid.Despite their size differences and the BoNT genes they contain, the three plasmids containing these toxin cluster genes share significant sequence identity. The presence of partial insertion sequence (IS) elements, evidence of recombination/gene duplication events, and the discovery of the BoNT/A3, BoNT/Ba4 and BoNT/B1 toxin complex genes within plasmids illustrate the different mechanisms by which these genes move among diverse genetic backgrounds of C. botulinum."
https://openalex.org/W1968317244,"Human bone marrow contains two major cell types, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs possess self-renewal capacity and pluripotency defined by their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes and muscle cells. MSCs are also known to differentiate into neurons and glial cells in vitro, and in vivo following transplantation into the brain of animal models of neurological disorders including ischemia and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) stroke. In order to obtain sufficient number and homogeneous population of human MSCs, we have clonally isolated permanent and stable human MSC lines by transfecting primary cell cultures of fetal human bone marrow MSCs with a retroviral vector encoding v-myc gene. One of the cell lines, HM3.B10 (B10), was found to differentiate into neural cell types including neural stem cells, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in vitro as shown by expression of genetic markers for neural stem cells (nestin and Musashi1), neurons (neurofilament protein, synapsin and MAP2), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and oligodendrocytes (myelin basic protein, MBP) as determined by RT-PCR assay. In addition, B10 cells were found to differentiate into neural cell types as shown by immunocytochical demonstration of nestin (for neural stem cells), neurofilament protein and beta-tubulin III (neurons) GFAP (astrocytes), and galactocerebroside (oligodendrocytes). Following brain transplantation in mouse ICH stroke model, B10 human MSCs integrate into host brain, survive, differentiate into neurons and astrocytes and induce behavioral improvement in the ICH animals. B10 human MSC cell line is not only a useful tool for the studies of organogenesis and specifically for the neurogenesis, but also provides a valuable source of cells for cell therapy studies in animal models of stroke and other neurological disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2035541724,"Dengue is one of the most important human diseases transmitted by an arthropod vector and the incidence of dengue virus infection has been increasing - over half the world's population now live in areas at risk of infection. Most infections are asymptomatic, but a subset of patients experience a potentially fatal shock syndrome characterised by plasma leakage. Severe forms of dengue are epidemiologically associated with repeated infection by more than one of the four dengue virus serotypes. Generally attributed to the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement, recent observations indicate that T-cells may also influence disease phenotype.Virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) showing high level cross reactivity between dengue serotypes could be expanded from blood samples taken during the acute phase of secondary dengue infection. These could not be detected in convalescence when only CTL populations demonstrating significant serotype specificity were identified. Dengue cross-reactive CTL clones derived from these patients were of higher avidity than serotype-specific clones and produced much higher levels of both type 1 and certain type 2 cytokines, many previously implicated in dengue pathogenesis.Dengue serotype cross-reactive CTL clones showing high avidity for antigen produce higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than serotype-specific clones. That such cells cannot be expanded from convalescent samples suggests that they may be depleted, perhaps as a consequence of activation-induced cell death. Such high avidity cross-reactive memory CTL may produce inflammatory cytokines during the course of secondary infection, contributing to the pathogenesis of vascular leak. These cells appear to be subsequently deleted leaving a more serotype-specific memory CTL pool. Further studies are needed to relate these cellular observations to disease phenotype in a large group of patients. If confirmed they have significant implications for understanding the role of virus-specific CTL in pathogenesis of dengue disease."
https://openalex.org/W1996609966,"Vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and maturation are three major phases of the development of blood vessels. Although many receptors required for blood vessel formation have been defined, the intracellular signal transduction pathways involved in vascular maturation remain unclear. KLF2–/– embryos fail to develop beyond 13.5 days because of a lack of blood vessel stabilization. The molecular mechanism of KLF2 function in embryonic vascular vessels is still largely unknown. Here we show a normal development pattern of endothelial cells in KLF2–/– embryos but a defect of smooth muscle cells at the dorsal side of the aorta. This phenotype results from arrested vascular maturation characterized by the failure of mural cells to migrate around endothelial cells. This migration defect is also observed when platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF) controlled migration is studied in murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells from KLF2–/– animals. In addition, KLF2–/– MEFs exhibit a significant growth defect, indicating that KLF2 is required to maintain the viability of MEF cells. The PDGF signal is mediated through the Src signaling pathway, and a downstream target of KLF2 is sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1. These studies demonstrate that KLF2 is required for smooth muscle cell migration and elucidate a novel mechanism involving communication between PDGF and KLF2 in vascular maturation.

KLFs activate or repress genes involved in a number of cellular processes, many of which appear to be involved in late stages of cellular differentiation and development (4Bieker J.J.

Additional studies by our laboratory and others have demonstrated that KLF2 plays an important role in differentiation and function in a variety of cell types, including T lymphocytes, monocytes, lung cells, and adipocytes (7Kuo C.T.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11098-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A massive deficit of peripheral T cells in KLF2-null mice is because of a defect of thymocyte and T cell trafficking rather than T cell apoptosis as was originally thought (7Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Leiden J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 1986-1990Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 11Carlson C.M. Endrizzi B.T. Wu J. Ding X. Weinreich M.A. Walsh E.R. Wani M.A. Lingrel J.B. Hogquist K.A. Jameson S.C. Nature. 2006; 442: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of KLF2 for T cell emigration. KLF2-deficient mice also show impaired lung development (6Wani M.A. Wert S.E. Lingrel J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21180-21185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which occurs at the late canalicular stage. Embryos of mice lacking KLF2 have a reasonably normal blood vessel network, and vasculogenesis as well as angiogenesis appear normal (9Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the KLF2–/– embryos do not survive beyond 12.5–14.5 days because of severe hemorrhage resulting from defects in the endothelial cell-mediated assembly and/or stabilization of the blood vessel wall (12Kuo C.T.

However, defects responsible for the loss of vascular integrity are unknown. The bleeding could be due to KLF2 deficiency in endothelial cells and/or mural cells.

The vertebrate vascular wall is composed of endothelial cells and mural cells, which are referred to as either pericytes or vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (13Folkman J. D'Amore P.A. Cell. 1996; 87: 1153-1155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). Vascular development is facilitated by complex patterns of gene expression, which involve a combination of vascular-specific genes and specialized genomic regulatory regions to coordinate expression of both vascular-specific and ubiquitous genes. Many transcription factors critical for vascular development have been identified by targeted disruption, often leading to pronounced vascular defects (14Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yang J. Boerm M. McCarty M. Bucana C. Fidler I.J. Zhuang Y. Su B. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Angiogenesis is also affected by specific transcription factor ablation and serves as a model that recapitulates many of the molecular events occurring during vascular development (16Folkman J. Annu. Rev. Med. 2006; 57: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). After initial endothelial tube formation, vessel maturation requires the subsequent recruitment of surrounding mesenchymal cells and their differentiation into vascular smooth muscle cells. This process involves the interaction of endothelial cells with mural cells and the release of specific growth factors. Several transcription factors have also been shown to be critical for this process. For instance, SMAD5 and MEF2C have been shown to be important in vascular development and in smooth muscle cell differentiation (14Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development (Camb.). 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Yang X. Castilla L.H. Xu X. Li C. Gotay J. Weinstein M. Liu P.P. Deng C.X. Development (Camb.). 1999; 126: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of SMAD5 leads to vascular formation defects with embryonic lethality at day 10.5 to 11.5. These mice exhibit a prominent defect in vessel morphology, principally enlarged blood vessels with diminished numbers of SMCs. The loss of SMCs results from apoptosis of mesenchymal cells, which subsequently decreases the number of these cells available for maturation into SMCs. Previous studies revealed an important role of KLF2 in blood vessel wall integrity (9Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M.

Lepore J.J. Lo C.W. Kahn M.L. Dev. Cell. 2006; 11: 845-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether KLF2 controls SMC coverage of vessels in a cell-autonomous fashion by functioning directly in SMCs or indirectly through its activity in endothelial cells. Therefore, it is important to explore the molecular mechanisms of KLF2 in regulating embryonic vascular vessels. Studies described in this investigation are directed toward elucidating the role of KLF2 regulation in mural cells during embryonic vascular vessel development and maturation. Mice and Cell Culture–KLF2-null mice were produced as described previously (9Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, Hprt-negative ES cells (El4TG2a) were targeted by homologous recombination to generate a 2.2-kb deletion that includes the promoter region, as well as exons 1 and 2 that code for the transcription activation domain and a part of the DNA binding domain, ensuring that no KLF2 mRNA and therefore no KLF2 protein is made in animals homozygous for the targeted allele. The chimeric mice were bred with Black Swiss for germ line competency testing. Resultant heterozygotes have been maintained on a mixed background (N18, C57BL6/129P2OlaHsd/nTac:NIHBS). Because KLF2–/– mouse embryos die around 12.5 days, we used KLF2–/– and KLF2+/+ embryos that were harvested at day 11.5. The preparation of MEFs was established by a modified protocol (10Wu J. Srinivasan S.V. Neumann J.C. Lingrel J.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11098-11105Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, fibroblasts were obtained by overnight trypsin digestion of eviscerated embryos and plating of cells in DMEM with 15% FBS. After first passage, MEFs were incubated with 10% FBS/DMEM. Cells used for this study were from passages 3–6. Jurkat/KLF2 Tet-On cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. KLF2 induction was performed as described previously (19Wu J. Lingrel J.B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8088-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Histological Analysis and Immunohistochemistry–Embryos (E12.5 days), including yolk sac, were dissected into PBS and observed for gross abnormalities. The yolk sac was carefully removed, and the embryos were then fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin overnight. The embryos were dehydrated through increasing concentrations of ethanol, transferred into xylene, and embedded in paraffin. The embryos were sectioned at 5 μm, and a series was stained with hematoxylin and eosin or Masson's Tri-Chrome. For immunohistochemistry, alternating sections were taken and baked at 60 °C for 1 h, cleared in xylene two times for 15 min, and hydrated through a descending alcohol series for 3 min each ending in distilled H2O. The sections were rinsed once in PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS Tw). Antigen retrieval was accomplished using an antigen retrieval solution (Vector Laboratories) at 95–100 °C for 10 min. The sections were allowed to cool to room temperature in the citrate buffer for 1 h. The sections were then rinsed in PBS Tw. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked using 3% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min. Sections were rinsed several times in PBS Tw and were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 2.5% normal goat serum in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. Sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibodies against smooth muscle α-actin (mouse 1:1500; Sigma), CD34 (rat 1:50 antibody; Abcam, Inc.). Sections were rinsed, and appropriate biotinylated 2° antibodies (1:300) were applied for 45 min at room temperature followed by ABC for 45 min using Vector ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Reactions were visualized using 3,3-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories), counterstained with hematoxylin, and finally coverslipped using Vectamount. Cell Growth Curve and Thymidine Uptake Assay–KLF2+/+, KLF2+/–, and KLF2–/– MEFs were seeded in 24-well plates at 1 × 104 cells per well, incubated at 37 °C, and treated with standard medium that was replaced every 2 days. The number of cells/ml was determined daily by removing cells from triplicate wells and counting in a hemocytometer. Dead cells were determined by the exclusion of trypan blue. KLF2–/– ES cells and the parental cell line E14TG2a were recovered from frozen stocks onto mitomycin-treated MEFs and then passaged once onto gelatinized plates to eliminate feeders. All media contained leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon), 15% FBS, l-glutamine, β-mercaptoethanol, and nonessential amino acids in DMEM. Cells were trypsinized, counted, and plated at 2000/well in triplicate for each time point. Measurement of cellular proliferation was also determined by estimating [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA. MEFs (1 × 104) in 12-well dishes were starved for 24 h in serum-free medium and pulsed with 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine and 20 ng/ml PDGF 6 h before harvest. After 6 h, cells were harvested on glass fiber filters using a cell harvester. Disintegrations per min were determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cell Migration Assay–Migration of mouse embryonic fibroblasts toward a PDGF-B gradient was examined according to the procedure described previously (20Zhu Y. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36257-36263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3 × 105 cells were made quiescent by incubation with DMEM and 0.4% fetal bovine serum for 48 h before PDGF-B treatment. A 0.1-ml aliquot of the cell suspension was added to the top chamber of tissue culture-treated Transwell polycarbonate membrane with 8-μm pores in 24-well plates. The lower Transwell compartment contained 0.6 ml of DMEM, 0.4% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin with or without 20 ng/ml PDGF-B. After incubating for 4 h at 37°C, the upper surface of the filters was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then fixed with methanol for 10 min at 4 °C followed by hematoxylin staining. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of each filter was counted in different high power fields at a magnification of 320. Experiments were performed in triplicate. RNA Preparation, Northern Blot, and RT-PCR–Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and treated with DNase I (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (19Wu J. Lingrel J.B. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 8088-8096Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of total RNA (5 μg/lane) was size-fractionated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane. Blots were immobilized by UV cross-linking and hybridized to [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probe from the 3′-untranslated region of mouse KLF2. The bands were detected using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). For RT-PCR, total RNA (3.5 μg) was reverse-transcribed and the PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by up to 25 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C, annealing at 55 °C, and extension at 72 °C. PCR primer pairs were as follows: KLF2 (forward, 5′-GCACGGATGAGGACCTAAAC-3′; reverse, 5′-GTAGCTGCAAGTATGTGTGG-3′), GAPDH (forward, 5′-GGAGATTGTTGCCATCAACG-3′; reverse, 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′), S1P1 (forward, 5′-CAGCTCAGTCTCTGACTATG-3′; reverse, 5′-CCTTGTTGGTCAGAGTGTAG-3′), S1P3 (forward, 5′-CCGGGAACATTACGATTACG-3′; reverse, 5′-GCCTCATCTTGATCATGGTC-3′), and KLF4 (forward, 5′-GGAACTCTCTCACATGAAGC-3′; reverse, 5′-CTGTGGCGGAATGTATACTG-3′). Transient Transfection and Promoter Luciferase Assay–A –287 S1P1 promoter fragment was generated by PCR, designated as S1P1luc. A site-directed mutagenesis generated mutation of a consensus KLF2-binding site was designated as S1P1mt. For S1P1 promoter activity, transient transfections of MEFs were plated in 6-well dishes at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well, and transient transfections were performed the following day using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). The total amount of DNA used for the transfection assay per well was always held constant at 1 μg. The KLF2 expression plasmid was generated by subcloning KLF2 cDNA into pCDNA3.1. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h later, and luciferase activity was measured using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (Pharmingen) and expressed as relative light units using a luciferase assay kit (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with a commercially available kit (Promega). Promoter activity of each construct was expressed as the ratio of luciferase/β-galactoside activity. All transfections were performed in triplicate from three independent experiments.

To address this issue, we first examined histological sections from KLF2–/– mice. Up to day E11.5, KLF2–/– embryos appeared phenotypically normal (data not shown). At E12.5, the KLF2–/– embryos could be identified by their abnormal yolk sacs with reduced blood in the vasculature (data not shown). After removing the yolk sac, intraembryonic bleeding was evident in the abdomen of KLF2–/– embryos (data not shown; as described previously by us (9Wani M.A. Means Jr., R.T. Lingrel J.B. Transgenic Res. 1998; 7: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Leiden and co-workers (12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar)). The morphology of the vasculature was characterized by immunohistochemical staining using CD34 (a marker for endothelial cells). Consistent with previous reports (12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), a substantially normal vascular plexus was observed both in KLF2–/– animals and age-matched control embryos (data not shown). Histological sections of hematoxylin and eosinstained E12.5 KLF2–/– embryos revealed a normal capillary structure with both small and large vessels as well as normal capillary splitting (data not shown). In summary, these data confirmed that KLF2 is not essential for the formation of tubular endothelial structures (vasculogenesis) or for sprouting and splitting of existing vessels (angiogenesis) or remodeling of tubular endothelial structures into arteries and veins. To further assess blood vessel wall morphology and stabilization at later stages of development, we analyzed the aorta of KLF2–/– mice. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained saggital and transverse sections of aorta in KLF2–/– embryos showed a normal pattern of the endothelial cell layer (Fig. 1) compared with wild type littermates. Wild type aorta contained an intact layer of CD34+ endothelial cells (Fig. 1 A, C and E), surrounded by well organized layers of differentiating smooth muscle cells (SMCs), which is confirmed by α-actin (SMαA) immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 3A). Since a previous study (12Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L. Barton K.P. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Leiden J.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2996-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) reported endothelial cell necrosis in KLF2–/– mice mediated the assembly and stabilization of the vessel wall, we closely examined the endothelial layer in small and large vessels in KLF2–/– embryos. The KLF2–/– aorta (Fig. 1, D and F) and other arteries as well as veins (data not shown) clearly contained CD34+ endothelial cells, confirming that KLF2 is not required for the specification of endothelial cell lineage. Moreover, the CD34+ staining patterns in KLF2–/– embryos are similar to those in wild type embryos (Fig. 1, D and F), indicating a normal endothelium pattern in KLF2 knock-out mice. High magnification microscopy of hematoxylin and eosin staining in KLF2–/– embryos showed no evidence of necrosis or degeneration of the endothelial cell layer (Fig. 1H and Fig. 2D), arguing against defects of the vascular wall being caused by endothelial cell necrosis.FIGURE 3Deficient smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix in KLF2–/– embryos.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesized and assembled by endothelial cells plays an important role for endothelium basement membrane matrix in vessel stabilization. Collagen IV, which is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells (21St. Croix B. Rago C. Velculescu V. Traverso G. Romans K.E. Montgomery E. Lal A. Riggins G.J. Lengauer C. Vogelstein B. Kinzlerl K.W. Science. 2000; 289: 1197-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (1650) Google Scholar), is the most abundant constituent of the vascular basement membrane (22Kalluri R. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 422-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Therefore, we further examined the expression level of collagen type IV that is necessary for stability of the basement membrane under conditions of mechanical stress and required for embryonic survival during development (23Poschl E. Schlotzer-Schrehardt U. Brachvogel B. Saito K. Ninomiya Y. Mayer U. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 1619-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1G, collagen type IV is ubiquitously expressed in the blood vessel wall close to the endothelium in wild type embryos. KLF2 knock-out embryos share a similar expression pattern and levels of collagen type IV compared with wild type embryos (Fig. 1H), and obvious necrosis is not observed in the basement membrane, suggesting the integrity of endothelium basement membrane in KLF2–/– embryos. Taken together, these data indicate that KLF2–/– embryos have an intact endothelium, thus suggesting that KLF2 in endothelial cells is unlikely to have a crucial role in maintaining the function of endothelial cells at this stage during blood vessel maturation. This argues against endothelial KLF2 playing a critical function for the stabilization of the vascular wall. However, it still cannot be excluded that a possible function of KLF2 in the interplay between endothelial and mural cells occurs. Therefore, we explored the requirement of KLF2 in another essential vascular cell type smooth muscle cells. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Defects in KLF2–/– Embryos–We observe some smooth muscle cells in the vessels of KLF2–/– embryos (Fig. 1B, Fig. 2, B and D, and Fig. 3, B and D), confirming that KLF2 is unlikely necessary for the specification of smooth muscle cell lineage. However, the smooth muscle layer in the KLF2 knock-out embryo is poorly developed although it shows no evidence of the necrosis or degeneration (Fig. 1B and Fig. 2, B and D). We did not observe any cuboidal smooth muscle cells in KLF2–/– aorta. In contrast, KLF2–/– SMCs displayed a sparse patchy morphology of smaller size and condensed nuclei compared with their wild type controls. In longitudinal sections of E12.5 control embryos stained with anti-SMαA, four to five layers of smooth muscle cells evenly enveloped the entire dorsal aorta (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the aorta of KLF2–/– mice was strikingly different. SMCs were deficient along the entire length of the dorsal surface examined (Fig. 3, B and D). Most of SMαA-positive SMCs were present on the ventral side; few of them were on the dorsal side. As has been shown before (24Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (3494) Google Scholar), after the initial formation of the vascular plexus, the vessel maturation is stabilized through recruitment and differentiation of mural cells in vascular walls. SMCs initially appear on the ventral surface of the aorta in E10.5 embryos (25Takahashi Y. Imanaka T. Takano T. Anat. Embryol. 1996; 194: 515-526PubMed Google Scholar), followed by migration to the dorsal surface. By E12.5, the aorta is completely surrounded by SMCs. Any defect of migration or proliferation in this stage may result in the poor distribution of smooth muscle cells. These deficits could weaken the integrity of the blood vessel wall; therefore, the vessel wall cannot maintain blood flow and results in the rupture of the blood vessel. Thus, the deficiency of SMCs along the entire length of the dorsal surface in KLF2–/– mice indicates a possible defect of SMC migration. The deficient SMCs at the dorsal side of KLF2–/– embryos were also observed in the hematoxylin and eosin-stained sagittal and transverse sections of the aorta as shown in Fig. 2. In addition, the general ECM pattern in KLF2–/– mice was also examined because ECM plays an important role in the support of vessel stabilization. Trichrome is a common method used for the staining of ECM in the vessel wall. Erythrocytes show up as yellow or red; cytoplasm, fibrin, and muscle are red; and collagen is blue. As shown in Fig. 3, E and F, the cross-section of the aorta in KLF2–/– mice demonstrate that fewer smooth muscle cells and collagen occur compared with the age-matched wild type embryos, suggesting that the deficient ECM components in KLF2–/– can also contribute to the defect of vessel maturation. The deficient ECM in KLF2–/– embryos could result from fewer smooth muscle cells and defects in ECM synthesis and assembly. In summary, the defects of the smooth muscle cell layer in the vessel wall of KLF2–/– mice may be responsible for the lethal hemorrhage.

Several studies have indicated that cyclin D1 translation is decreased upon activation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinases. We examined the effect of activation of the eIF2α kinases PKR and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) on cyclin D1 protein levels and translation and determined that cyclin D1 protein levels decrease upon the induction of PKR and PERK catalytic activity but that this decrease is not due to translation. Inhibition of the 26 S proteasome with MG132 rescued cyclin D1 protein levels, indicating that rather than inhibiting translation, PKR and PERK act to increase cyclin D1 degradation. Interestingly, this effect still requires eIF2α phosphorylation at serine 51, as cyclin D1 remains unaffected in cells containing a non-phosphorylatable form of the protein. This proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 requires an intact ubiquitination pathway, although the ubiquitination of cyclin D1 is not itself affected. Furthermore, this degradation is independent of phosphorylation of cyclin D1 at threonine 286, which is mediated by the glycogen synthase kinase 3β and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as described in previous studies. Our study reveals a novel functional cross-talk between eIF2α phosphorylation and the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 and that this degradation is dependent upon eIF2α phosphorylation during short, but not prolonged, periods of stress.

Originally cloned as a break point rearrangement in parathyroid adenoma (1Motokura T. Bloom T. Kim H.G. Juppner H. Ruderman J.V. Kronenberg H.M. Arnold A. Nature. 1991; 350: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar), cyclin D1 serves as a key sensor and integrator of extracellular signals of cells in early to mid-G1 phase (2Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). It primarily functions as the regulatory subunit of the holoenzymes that regulate progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. By working in conjunction with the cyclin E-cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) complex, cyclin D1-CDK complexes phosphorylate and inactivate the cell-cycle inhibitory function of the retinoblastoma protein (2Fu M. Wang C. Li Z. Sakamaki T. Pestell R.G. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5439-5447Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). Via this inhibition, cyclin D1 can release the repression of E2F transcriptional activity by retinoblastoma protein and the associated histone deacetylases and facilitate the transcription of genes active during the S phase of the cell cycle. Cyclin D1 has been demonstrated to have both cyclin-dependent kinase-dependent and -independent functions. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-dependent functions include the ability to regulate the function of CDKs 4 and 6, leading to the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, and the indirect activation of the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, whereas cyclin D1 can promote the dissociation of histone deacetylase 1 from the retinoblastoma protein repressor complex in a CDK-independent manner.

Protein translation is a well regulated process that involves three general steps: initiation, elongation, and termination. The majority of translation regulation is exerted at the initiation step, a complex and intricate event involving a large number of different polypeptides. Initiation requires the joining of the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits to form a functional 80 S ribosome, and the correct positioning of the ribosome at the start cordon (AUG) (23Gebauer F. Hentze M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). The first step of initiation is the formation of the ternary complex, composed of eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet. This complex binds to the 40 S subunit, facilitated by the initiation factors eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF3, to form the 43 S pre-initiation complex. Binding of the 43 S subunit to mRNA is facilitated by the eIF4F complex, which binds to the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA. Once loaded onto the mRNA, the 43 S complex scans the sequence until it reaches the start cordon, at which point eIF2-GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and the resultant eIF2-GDP complex dissociates from the translational machinery. Following this step, the 60 S subunit joins the 40 S via eIF5B to yield the fully functional 80 S ribosome. There are a number of different steps at which regulation of initiation can occur, one of the best characterized being the phosphorylation of the eIF2 on the α-subunit, which prevents recycling of GDP bound to eIF2 for GTP by eIF2B (23Gebauer F. Hentze M.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). As a result, eIF2 remains bound to eIF2B, and global mRNA translation is inhibited. Four eIF2α kinases have been identified to date that are each activated under different conditions but which all act to inhibit global protein synthesis, including the protein kinase activated by double-stranded RNA (PKR), which reacts to virus infection (Kaufman, 2000) (24Dever T.E.

Cell Res. 2000; 254: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and concluded that the eIF2 kinase activity after ER stress causes a decrease in the translation of cyclin D1 mRNA but does not affect transcription of the cyclin D1 gene (30Hamanaka R.B. Bennett B.S. Cullinan S.B. Diehl J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5493-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In the following study we demonstrate that activation of two different eIF2α kinases, PKR and PERK, cause a decrease in cyclin D1 protein levels and that this down-regulation requires eIF2α phosphorylation at serine 51. We further demonstrate using polysome profiles that it is not translation of the cyclin D1 message that is affected by activation of the kinases, as the cyclin D1 message is translated equally well regardless of the state of eIF2α kinase activity or the inhibition of global protein synthesis. We determine that PKR and PERK function to induce the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1 independent of any previously described mechanism but still requiring cyclin D1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, our data also shows that eIF2α kinases themselves may activate different pathways to regulate the “early” and “late” degradation of cyclin D1. Our study reveals a novel ability of PKR and PERK to promote the proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin D1 in a manner that depends on eIF2α phosphorylation.

Briefly, after the indicated treatments, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added directly to growth media and then immediately removed, and the plates kept on ice. Plates were washed 3 times with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline plus 100 μg/ml cycloheximide and lysed directly on the plate. After a 10-min incubation on ice, samples were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the lysate was loaded onto 10–55% sucrose gradients prepared on the Teledyne ISCO Density Gradient System. Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman L7–65 vacuum ultracentrifuge with a SW40.Ti rotor at 40,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4 °C under vacuum. 18 fractions were collected per sample using the Foxy Jr. Fraction Collector. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCRRNA was isolated from collected polysome fractions as follows. 600 μl of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and 120 μl of chloroform (Sigma) were added to each sucrose fraction and centrifuged, and the aqueous phase was removed to a separate tube. 600 μl of isopropanol was added to each fraction, and RNA was precipitated overnight at –20 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min, and the pellets were washed with ice-cold 75% ethanol and resuspended in 10 μl of Milli-Q H2O. 3 μl of RNA was used as a template for RT reactions with the AncT primer (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3′). cDNA samples were diluted 10-fold, and 2 μl of template used to carry out PCR reactions for CCND1 (forward human primer, 5′-CGC GCC CTC GGT GTC CTA CTT-3′; reverse human primer, 5′-ACG CTC CCC GCT GCC ACC AT-3′; forward mouse primer, 5′-CTG GAG GTC TGT GAG GAG CA-3′; reverse mouse primer, 5′-GCG GTA GCA GGA GAG GAA GTT) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; forward primer, 5′-CAT CAT CTC TGC CCC CTC TGC T-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAG CGG TCG T TC ACC ACC TTC T-3′).

Tran35S-label (ICN) was then added to the cells at a concentration of 100 μCi/106 cells, and the culture was continued for an additional 30 min in the presence of MG132 and coumermycin. Precipitation of radio-labeled proteins was carried out as follows; 250 μg of total protein was aliquot into microcentrifuge tubes in triplicate.

All antibodies were used at a final concentration of 0.1–1 μg/ml. After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:1,000 dilution; Amersham Biosciences), proteins were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Quantification of the bands in the linear range of exposure was performed by densitometry using the NIH Image 1.54 software. Cyclin D1 Protein Levels Are Decreased upon Endoplasmic Reticulum StressPrevious reports have indicated that translation of cyclin D1 is affected by the induction of ER stress and the unfolded protein response (28Brewer J.W.

Cell. 2005; 16: 5493-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of eIF2α phosphorylation in regulating cyclin D1 in our system, we treated HT1080 cells with the pharmacological agent thapsigargin, which induces the UPR by promoting calcium release from the ER. Treatment of these cells with thapsigargin induced a decrease in cyclin D1 levels (Fig. 1A, panel a) coincident with increased eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1A, panel b). To investigate the specific effect of eIF2α phosphorylation on cyclin D1 regulation, we used the compound Sal003, which inhibits eIF2α dephosphorylation (40Robert F. Kapp L.D. Khan S.N. Acker M.G. Kolitz S. Kazemi S. Kaufman R.J. Merrick W.C. Koromilas A.E. Lorsch J.R. Pelletier J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4632-4644Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1 levels decreased significantly upon Sal003 treatment in HT1080 cells (Fig. 1B, panel a), once again accompanied by an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation (Fig. 1B, panel b), indicating a strong relationship between eIF2α phosphorylation and the level of cyclin D1. To determine whether the observed effect on cyclin D1 was due to decreased translation as previously proposed, we examined translation of cyclin D1 mRNA using polysome profiles on HT1080 cells treated with either thapsigargin or Sal003. This technique involves the separation of large cellular components using a sucrose gradient and the monitoring of the A254 across the gradient. In this manner the 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits as well as monosomes and polysomes can be isolated and studied. Although GAPDH mRNA underwent a shift from the translating polysomes to the stalled monosomes (Fig. 1C, panel b), cyclin D1 mRNA remained associated with the polysome fractions (Fig. 1C, panel a). The observable shift in GAPDH, but not in cyclin D1, confirms that a general translation is being inhibiting but suggests that a mechanism other than translation regulation contributes to the down-regulation of cyclin D1. Down-regulation of Cyclin D1 Requires eIF2α PhosphorylationBecause phosphorylation of eIF2α is believed to be essential for the observed regulation of cyclin D1 (30Hamanaka R.B. Bennett B.S. Cullinan S.B. Diehl J.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5493-5501Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), we sought to elucidate whether it alone can affect cyclin D1 translation. We treated eIF2α A/A MEFs in which Ser-51 was replaced with a non-phosphorylatable alanine (33Scheuner D. Song B. McEwen E. Liu C. Laybutt R. Gillespie P. Saunders T. Bonner-Weir S. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1165-1176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and their wild type eIF2α S/S counterparts with thapsigargin and immunoblotted for cyclin D1 (Fig. 2A, panel a). Cyclin D1 was quickly and significantly decreased by more than 50% in eIF2α S/S MEFs (Fig. 2, A, lanes 1–5, and B) but remained steady in eIF2α A/A knock-in cells (Fig. 2, A, lanes 6–10, and B). Once again we performed polysome profiles to examine the translation of cyclin D1 in these cells (Fig. 2C, panels i-iv). Treatment with thapsigargin induced inhibition of global translation initiation in eIF2α S/S, but not A/A cells (compare panels ii and iv), but cyclin D1 mRNA remained associated with the polysome fractions (Fig. 2C, panel a). It is interesting to note that although inhibition of general translation does not result in a shift of cyclin D1 mRNA to earlier polysome fractions, the CCND1 transcript is localized to earlier fractions in eIF2α S/S cells compared with their knock-in counterparts. This may be due to slight differences in the overall translational activity of these cell lines, as the profiles themselves also show slight variances. Together these data suggest that although the observed regulation of cyclin D1 protein levels is not a result of the ability of eIF2α to inhibit translation, phosphorylation of this factor is essential. Activation of a Conditionally Active Form of PKR Decreases Cyclin D1 Protein LevelsThe role of several eIF2α kinases in regulating cyclin D1 has been investigated in a number of previous studies. However, the treatments used to induce stress in these cases could potentially activate a large number of other cellular responses in addition to eIF2α kinase activity. Because eIF2α phosphorylation at Ser-51 is predominantly associated with inhibiting global translation initiation, we therefore investigated whether cyclin D1 was translationally regulated in a system containing a conditionally active form of PKR (41Ung T.L. Cao C. Lu J. Ozato K. Dever T.E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3728-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HT1080 cells stably expressing a chimeric protein in which the catalytic domain of PKR was fused to the first 220 amino acids of the Escherichia coli gyrase B protein were analyzed (32Kazemi S.

Treatment of these cells with the antibiotic coumermycin caused dimerization of the GyrB domain and autophosphorylation and activation of PKR (32Kazemi S. Papadopoulou S. Li S. Su Q. Wang S.

https://openalex.org/W2038224489,"Among gynecologic cancers, ovarian cancer is the second most common and has the highest death rate. Cancer is a genetic disorder and arises due to the accumulation of somatic mutations in critical genes. An understanding of the genetic basis of ovarian cancer has implications both for early detection and for therapeutic intervention in this population of patients.Fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines, commonly used for in vitro experiments, were screened for mutations using bidirectional direct sequencing in all coding regions of BRAF, MEK1 and MEK2. BRAF mutations were identified in four of the fifteen ovarian cancer cell lines studied. Together, these four cell lines contained four different BRAF mutations, two of which were novel. ES-2 had the common B-Raf p.V600E mutation in exon 15 and Hey contained an exon 11 missense mutation, p.G464E. The two novel B-Raf mutants identified were a 5 amino acid heterozygous deletion p.N486-P490del in OV90, and an exon 4 missense substitution p.Q201H in OVCAR 10. One of the cell lines, ES-2, contained a mutation in MEK1, specifically, a novel heterozygous missense substitution, p.D67N which resulted from a nt 199 G-->A transition. None of the cell lines contained coding region mutations in MEK2. Functional characterization of the MEK1 mutant p.D67N by transient transfection with subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated increased ERK phosphorylation as compared to controls.In this study, we report novel BRAF mutations in exon 4 and exon 12 and also report the first mutation in MEK1 associated with human cancer. Functional data indicate the MEK1 mutation may confer alteration of activation through the MAPK pathway. The significance of these findings is that BRAF and MEK1/2 mutations may be more common than anticipated in ovarian cancer which could have important implications for treatment of patients with this disease and suggests potential new therapeutic avenues."
https://openalex.org/W2057109089,"Insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane constitutes a key process for blood glucose control. However, convenient and robust assays to monitor this dynamic process in real time are lacking, which hinders current progress toward elucidation of the underlying molecular events as well as screens for drugs targeting this particular pathway. Here, we have developed a novel dual colored probe to monitor the translocation process of GLUT4 based on dual color fluorescence measurement. We demonstrate that this probe is more than an order of magnitude more sensitive than the current technology for detecting fusion events from single GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). A small fraction of fusion events were found to be of the ""kiss-and-run"" type. For the first time, we show that insulin stimulation evokes a approximately 40-fold increase in the fusion of GSVs in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, compared with basal conditions. The probe can also be used to monitor the prefusion behavior of GSVs. By quantifying both the docking and fusion rates simultaneously, we demonstrate a proportional inhibition in both docking and fusion of GSVs by a dominant negative mutant of AS160, indicating a role for AS160 in the docking of GSVs but not in the regulation of GSV fusion after docking."

Presently, it is unclear whether structural differences between the PHDs enable their selectivity for CODD and NODD. An understanding of how this regulation occurs is essential for developing a molecular understanding of the HIF system and potentially important for developing specific therapeutic targets. All characterized 2OG oxygenases possess a catalytic domain containing a core double-stranded β-helix (DSBH) fold which supports a highly conserved HXD/E... H iron binding motif (23Clifton I.J.

In contrast, the substrate binding residues are poorly conserved and can involve residues from the DSBH and surrounding regions, sometimes including the C-terminus (23Clifton I.J. McDonough M.A. Ehrismann D. Kershaw N.J. Granatino N. Schofield C.J. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2006; 100: 644-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although the catalytic domains of the PHDs are highly conserved, sequence analyses (Fig. 1) reveal unconserved regions in the flexible “finger-like” loop between β-strands 2 and 3, and in their C-terminal regions (24McDonough M.A. Li V.

Here we report mutation studies on the catalytic domain of human PHD2, an N-terminally truncated PHD that can be efficiently produced in an active recombinant form in Escherichia coli. The results reveal that the β2β3 “finger-like” loop has an important role in determining the differing selectivity of the PHDs for CODD relative to NODD. Materials–HIF-1α peptide substrates were obtained from Peptide Protein Research Ltd., Fareham, UK. The NODD peptide sequence used was DALTLLAPAAGDTIISLDF (one-letter amino acid abbreviations), and the CODD peptide sequence DLDLEMLAPYIPMDDDFQL. These peptides are referred to as NODD and CODD hereafter. A hydroxylated CODD peptide (CODDPro564-OH), DLDLEMLAHypYIPMDDDFQL (Hyp represents trans-4-hydroxyproline), was prepared on a CS Bio CS336 solid phase peptide synthesizer using a standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/N,N′-diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole strategy, then purified by reversed-phase HPLC. DNA primers were from SigmaGenosys Ltd. Cloning of PHD2181–402, PHD2Δloop, PHD2/1, and PHD2/3– The DNA sequence encoding PHD2181–426 has previously been ligated into the pET-24a vector (Novagen) (25Ehrismann D. Flashman E. Genn D.N. Mathioudakis N. Hewitson K.S. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The C-terminally truncated PHD2181–402 was produced using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) (for primers seesupplemental Table S1). A deletion variant (PHD2Δloop) was produced whereby residues 238–250 (theβ2β3 loop) were removed by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) (supplemental Table S1). Variant chimeric proteins were generated whereby the β2β3 loop of PHD2181–426 was replaced with that of either PHD1 or PHD3 (proteins termed PHD2/1 or PHD2/3, respectively). PHD2/1A forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) were designed and used to amplify the sequence encoding for PHD2181–243. PHD2/1B forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) were used to amplify the sequence encoding for PHD2251–426. The overhangs on primers PHD2/1A reverse and PHD2/1B forward, which encoded for PHD1 residues 222–232, were then able to self-prime in a further amplification reaction. NheI and BamHI restriction enzymes were used to digest and ligate the full PHD2/1 sequence into the pET-24a(+) vector. A set of primers (supplemental Table S1) was designed to mutate the DNA sequence encoding PHD2241–251 to the sequence encoding PHD362–73 by six rouns of site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing (Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford).

Unless stated, reactions took place for 15 min at 37 °C, then were stopped with 200 μl of methanol and incubated on ice for 20 min to allow complete absorption of all residual [14C]CO2. For kinetic measurements, the optimum assay time for measuring initial velocity was determined by time course experiments, and assays were then carried out over a range of substrate concentrations. Data were fit by the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot 2000, allowing Km (or apparent Km) and vmax to be determined. Hydroxylation Assays–Enzyme activity in terms of peptide substrate hydroxylation was measured by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Experimental conditions were as for the 2OG turnover assay. Assay solution (1 μl) was mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid MALDI matrix (1 μl) (LaserBio Labs) and spotted onto the target plate. Samples were analyzed using a MALDI-TOF micro MX mass spectrometer (Waters Micromass).

After controls were performed to eliminate mass transport effects, ligands were bound such that response units increased by 600–800.

PHD2181–402 Catalyzes 2OG Turnover and NODD/CODD Hydroxylation Similarly to PHD2181–426–Studies on some 2OG oxygenases from the subfamily to which the PHDs belong have revealed a role for the C-terminus of the enzyme in substrate binding and selectivity (23Clifton I.J.

Aside from their very different N termini, there are two regions where this conservation is not maintained: the C-terminus and the flexible β2β3 “finger-like” loop region located near the active site, suggesting a potential role for these regions in determining selectivity (24McDonough M.A. Li V. Flashman E. Chowdhury R. Mohr C. Lienard B.M. Zondlo J. Oldham N.J. Clifton I.J. Lewis J. McNeill L.A. Kurzeja R.J. Hewitson K.S. Yang E. Jordan S. Syed R.S. Schofield C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9814-9819Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A C-terminal truncation variant, PHD2181–402 was therefore targeted because significant sequence variation occurs to the C-terminal side of residue 402. Further truncations were also produced (PHD2181–399, PHD2181–397 and PHD2181–395), but these showed a reduction in catalytic activity (supplemental Fig. S1). We therefore focused on PHD2181–402 for substrate selectivity studies. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy indicated no significant differences between the secondary structures of PHD2181–402 and PHD2181–426 (supplemental Fig. S2). Activity assays, measuring total 2OG turnover during a standard 15-min incubation, were carried out to determine whether the C-terminal truncation had any effect on activity with the CODD and NODD substrates. The results revealed that truncation of the C terminus did not significantly alter the ability of PHD2181–426 to decarboxylate 2OG to succinate and CO2 when using either NODD or CODD peptide substrates (Fig. 2A). Similarly, no difference in 2OG turnover was seen between PHD2181–426 and PHD2181–402 when longer His6-CODD530–698 and His6-NODD344–503 protein substrates were used (supplemental Fig. S3). It is possible that removal of the C-terminus of the enzyme actually promotes uncoupled turnover of 2OG (28Lee H.J. Lloyd M.D. Harlos K. Clifton I.J. Baldwin J.E. Schofield C.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 937-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), i.e. without peptide hydroxylation. To ensure that the activity seen in this assay was coupled to peptide substrate hydroxylation, assays were repeated and the resultant peptides analyzed by MALDI mass spectrometry to detect hydroxylation, i.e. a +16 mass shift of the peptide substrate (Fig. 2B). The C-terminally truncated PHD2181–402 enzyme was found to hydroxylate both NODD and CODD substrates as efficiently as PHD2181–426 under these assay conditions. Further 2OG turnover assays, measuring initial velocity at substrate concentrations varying from 0–200 μm, gave Km values for PHD2181–426 of 44 μm and 37 μm for the NODD and CODD peptides, respectively (Table 1). Previously, PHD2181–426 Km values for NODD and CODD peptides were reported as 24 μm and 2 μm, respectively, as determined by an oxygen consumption assay (25Ehrismann D. Flashman E. Genn D.N. Mathioudakis N. Hewitson K.S. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and 130 μm and 7 μm, respectively, as determined by 2OG turnover assays using crude cell lysates containing expressed PHD2 (22Hirsila M. Koivunen P. Gunzler V. Kivirikko K.I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30772-30780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Thus, although the difference in Km values seen with this assay is minimal, other reported assays support a preference of PHD2181–426 for CODD over NODD (at least in terms of Km values). The differences in absolute values may reflect differences in assay conditions/substrates (including the presence or absence of ascorbate). PHD2181–402 was found to have Km values for NODD and CODD of 50 μm and 77 μm respectively, revealing that the NODD Km does not significantly alter when the C-terminus is removed from PHD2; the CODD Km however, approximately doubles on removal of the C-terminus. Truncation of the C-terminus also results in an increase in kcat for both substrates, with a larger increase for CODD than NODD. When the kcat/Km values are examined, it appears that removal of the C-terminus results in little overall change in catalytic efficiency and only a small bias in the CODD/NODD selectivity toward NODD.TABLE 1A comparison of the kinetics of 2OG turnoverEnzymeSubstrateReaction timeKmvmaxkcatkcat/Kmminμmpmol s-1s-1m-1 s-1PHD2181-42619mer NODD544.4 (±8.4)17.7 (±1.2)0.044 (±0.003)9.91 (±3.0) × 10219mer CODD536.7 (±9.0)13.2 (±1.3)0.033 (±0.003)8.99 (±3.2) × 102PHD2181-40219mer NODD550.1 (±8.1)27.6 (±1.6)0.069 (±0.004)13.8 (±3.1) × 10219mer CODD577.2 (±15.2)25.7 (±2.2)0.064 (±0.005)8.29 (±2.4) × 102PHD2/119mer NODD756.9 (±11.6)16.1 (±1.2)0.040 (±0.003)7.03 (±2.0) × 10219mer CODD763.0 (±15.7)12.6 (±1.6)0.031 (±0.004)4.92 (±2.0) × 102PHD2/319mer NODD756.0 (±9.2)23.0 (±1.4)0.057 (±0.003)10.2 (±2.3) × 10219mer CODD76.4 (±0.2)6.5 (±1.4)0.016 (±0.003)24.9 (±5.5) × 102 Open table in a new tab PHD2181–402 Shows a Similar Preference for CODD over NODD Hydroxylation to PHD2181–426–To unequivocally determine the preference of PHD2181–426 and PHD2181–402 for CODD over NODD in hydroxylation assays, competition assays in which both peptides were simultaneously present were carried out. Under standard conditions, with both substrates present at 150 μm (Fig. 3A), PHD2181–426 preferentially hydroxylated CODD peptide, while PHD2181–402 showed less selectivity between the two substrates. A greater selectivity for CODD hydroxylation was apparent for both PHD2181–426 and PHD2181–402 when both peptides were present at 500 μm (supplemental Fig. S4). When competition experiments were carried out over time periods ranging from 0–60 min (Fig. 3B, lower graphs), it appears that, when compared with single substrate experiments (Fig. 3B, upper graphs), CODD hydroxylation occurred at a faster rate than NODD hydroxylation for PHD2181–426, indicating selectivity for this substrate. The rate of NODD and CODD hydroxylation by PHD2181–402 is quite similar (compared with PHD2181–426) and this likely reflects the increased kcat/Km for hydroxylation of NODD over CODD seen for this variant compared with PHD2181–426. The results thus indicate that the C-terminal region, although it may contribute, is not the only factor or a dominant factor in determining substrate selectivity. PHD2181–402 and PHD2181–426 Show Similar Binding Characteristics to Both His6-NODD344–503 and His6-CODD530–698–To investigate whether the C-terminus has a role in substrate binding, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies were carried out using purified His6-CODD530–698 and His6-NODD344–503 HIF-1α substrates (Table 2). As reported (25Ehrismann D. Flashman E. Genn D.N. Mathioudakis N. Hewitson K.S. Ratcliffe P.J. Schofield C.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), PHD2181–426 binds to His6-CODD530–698 more strongly than it binds to His6-NODD344–503, as indicated by a slower dissociation rate constant (0.14 (±0.04) s–1 compared with 1.06 (±0.39) s–1, n = 7, p < 0.001). The association rate constants for the two substrates are very similar. PHD2181–402 also bound to His6-CODD530–698 more strongly than it did to His6-NODD344–503, again indicated by a slower dissociation rate constant (CODD: 0.16 (±0.03) s–1 compared with NODD: 0.64 (±0.13) s–1, n ≥ 5, p < 0.001). The rate of association for PHD2181–402 binding to CODD was slightly greater than that for NODD binding, though this difference was not statistically significant. The association and dissociation constants were also very similar for PHD2181–426 and PHD2181–402 with respect to each substrate, with the only statistically significant difference being a decrease in the dissociation constant for His6-NODD344–503 when the C-terminus is truncated (p < 0.05). These results reflect the similarities seen between PHD2181–426 and PHD2181–402 in catalysis.TABLE 2A comparison of the kinetics of the enzyme-substrate interactionEnzymeSubstratekakdm-1 s-1 × 105s-1PHD2181-426His6-NODD1.46 (±0.41)1.06 (±0.39)His6-CODD1.34 (±0.63)0.14 (±0.04)PHD2181-402His6-NODD1.50 (±0.37)0.64 (±0.13)His6-CODD2.09 (±0.87)0.16 (±0.03)PHD2/1His6-NODD12.0 (±9.5)0.22 (±0.17)His6-CODD29.5 (±11.7)0.20 (±0.11)PHD2/3His6-NODD1.54 (±0.33)0.54 (±0.16)His6-CODD61.3 (±28.0)0.17 (±0.03) Open table in a new tab PHD2/1 and PHD2/3 Catalyze 2OG Turnover and NODD/CODD Hydroxylation–As the results on deletion of the C-terminus did not explain the observed CODD/NODD selectivity of the different PHDs, the β2β3 loop region was next targeted. Initially residues 238–250 of PHD2181–426 were deleted and replaced by Ala-Ala, i.e. 237DGQLVSQKSDSSKDI251 was replaced with 237DAAI251. The Ala-Ala sequence was aimed at providing a short linker between β2 and β3 while still maintaining the overall fold. Although deleting the thirteen loop residues actually altered 2OG turnover in the presence of substrate peptides, with a marked increase in 2OG turnover in the presence of CODD (supplemental Fig. S5A), hydroxylation assays demonstrated that this variant catalyzed less than 5% substrate hydroxylation under the standard conditions of 15 min of incubation at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. S5B). Non-denaturing protein MS assays (31Hewitson K.S. Lienard B.M. McDonough M.A. Clifton I.J. Butler D. Soares A.S. Oldham N.J. McNeill L.A. Schofield C.J. J. Biol.

Together, these observations indicate that the β2β3 loop is involved in coupling 2OG decarboxylation to substrate hydroxylation. To investigate the proposal that the β2β3 “finger-like” loop sequences of the different PHDs are involved in selectivity, chimeras were produced where the β2β3 loop of PHD2181–426 (residues 238–251) were substituted with that of either PHD1 or PHD3 (PHD2/1 and PHD2/3). After purification, CD spectroscopy indicated no significant change in the secondary structure of the proteins when compared with PHD2181–426 (supplemental Fig. S2). The activities of PHD2/1 and PHD2/3 were compared with that of PHD2181–426 for CODD and NODD substrates. Both PHD2/1 and PHD2/3 variants behaved similarly to PH"

https://openalex.org/W2077665447,"PKCδ is essential for apoptosis, but regulation of the proapoptotic function of this ubiquitous kinase is not well understood. Nuclear translocation of PKCδ is necessary and sufficient to induce apoptosis and is mediated via a C-terminal bipartite nuclear localization sequence. However, PKCδ is found predominantly in the cytoplasm of nonapoptotic cells, and the apoptotic signal that activates its nuclear translocation is not known. We show that in salivary epithelial cells, phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues in the N-terminal regulatory domain directs PKCδ to the nucleus where it induces apoptosis. Analysis of each tyrosine residue in PKCδ by site-directed mutagenesis identified two residues, Y64 and Y155, as essential for nuclear translocation. Suppression of apoptosis correlated with suppressed nuclear localization of the Y → F mutant proteins. Moreover, a phosphomimetic PKCδ Y64D/Y155D mutant accumulated in the nucleus in the absence of an apoptotic signal. Forced nuclear accumulation of PKCδ-Y64F and Y155F mutant proteins, by attachment of an SV40 nuclear localization sequence, fully reconstituted their ability to induce apoptosis, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation per se is not required for apoptosis, but for targeting PKCδ to the nucleus. We propose that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of PKCδ in the regulatory domain functions as a switch to promote cell survival or cell death."
https://openalex.org/W1997042125,"Background “Timing” processes are mediated via a disturbed neuronal network including the basal ganglia. Brain structures important for “timing” are also discussed to be critical for the deterioration of movements in Huntington's disease (HD). Changes in “timing processes” are found in HD, but no study has varied the degree of motor demands in timing functions in parallel in HD. It may be hypothesized that timing functions may be deteriorated to a different extent in motor and non-motor timing, because in motor timing the underlying brain structures may be more demanding than in non-motor timing. Methodology/Principle Findings We assessed timing in two different experiments: a time-estimation (TE) and a time-discrimination (TD) task. The demand on motor functions is high in the TE-task and low in the TD-task. Furthermore, general motor ability was assessed at different complexity levels. A presymptomatic (pHD), a symptomatic (HD) and a control group were investigated. We found a decline in timing functions when demands on the motor system were high (TE-task), in HD and even in pHD, compared to controls. In non-motor timing (TD task) and in the assessment of general motor ability, performance in the pHD-group was comparable to the controls and better than in the symptomatic group. Performance in both timing tasks was related to the duration until the estimated age of onset in pHDs. Conclusions/Significance The study shows a selective deterioration of time-estimation processes in symptomatic and even presymptomatic Huntington's disease. Time-discrimination processes were not affected in both patient groups. The relation of timing performance to the duration until the estimated age of onset in pHD is of clinical importance."
https://openalex.org/W2010404772,"The deleterious effects of anoxia followed by reperfusion with oxygen in higher animals including mammals are well known. A convenient and genetically well characterized small-animal model that exhibits reproducible, quantifiable oxygen reperfusion damage is currently lacking. Here we describe the dynamics of whole-organism metabolic recovery from anoxia in an insect, Drosophila melanogaster, and report that damage caused by oxygen reperfusion can be quantified in a novel but straightforward way. We monitored CO2 emission (an index of mitochondrial activity) and water vapor output (an index of neuromuscular control of the spiracles, which are valves between the outside air and the insect's tracheal system) during entry into, and recovery from, rapid-onset anoxia exposure with durations ranging from 7.5 to 120 minutes. Anoxia caused a brief peak of CO2 output followed by knock-out. Mitochondrial respiration ceased and the spiracle constrictor muscles relaxed, but then re-contracted, presumably powered by anaerobic processes. Reperfusion to sustained normoxia caused a bimodal re-activation of mitochondrial respiration, and in the case of the spiracle constrictor muscles, slow inactivation followed by re-activation. After long anoxia durations, both the bimodality of mitochondrial reactivation and the recovery of spiracular control were impaired. Repeated reperfusion followed by episodes of anoxia depressed mitochondrial respiratory flux rates and damaged the integrity of the spiracular control system in a dose-dependent fashion. This is the first time that physiological evidence of oxygen reperfusion damage has been described in an insect or any invertebrate. We suggest that some of the traditional approaches of insect respiratory biology, such as quantifying respiratory water loss, may facilitate using D. melanogaster as a convenient, well-characterized experimental model for studying the underlying biology and mechanisms of ischemia and reperfusion damage and its possible mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2092268344,"Background Government agencies have defined a need to reduce, refine or replace current mammalian-based bioassays with testing methods that use alternative species. Invertebrate species, such as Caenorhabditis elegans, provide an attractive option because of their short life cycles, inexpensive maintenance, and high degree of evolutionary conservation with higher eukaryotes. The C. elegans pharynx is a favorable model for studying neuromuscular function, and the effects of chemicals on neuromuscular activity, i.e., feeding. Current feeding methodologies, however, are labor intensive and only semi-quantitative. Methodology/Principal Findings Here a high-throughput assay is described that uses flow cytometry to measure C. elegans feeding by determining the size and intestinal fluorescence of hundreds of nematodes after exposure to fluorescent-labeled microspheres. This assay was validated by quantifying fluorescence in feeding-defective C. elegans (eat mutants), and by exposing wild-type nematodes to the neuroactive compounds, serotonin and arecoline. The eat mutations previously determined to cause slow pumping rates exhibited the lowest feeding levels with our assay. Concentration-dependent increases in feeding levels after serotonin exposures were dependent on food availability, while feeding levels decreased in arecoline-exposed nematodes regardless of the presence of food. The effects of the environmental contaminants, cadmium chloride and chlorpyrifos, on wild-type C. elegans feeding were then used to demonstrate an application of the feeding assay. Cadmium exposures above 200 µM led to a sharp drop in feeding levels. Feeding of chlorpyrifos-exposed nematodes decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion with an EC50 of 2 µM. Conclusions/Significance The C. elegans fluorescence microsphere feeding assay is a rapid, reliable method for the assessment of neurotoxic effects of pharmaceutical drugs, industrial chemicals or environmental agents. This assay may also be applicable to large scale genetic or RNAi screens used to identify genes that are necessary for the development or function of the pharynx or other neuromuscular systems."
https://openalex.org/W1963697777,"In this study, we provide evidence that photostimulation of various cancer cells preloaded with a new photosensitizing compound, tetrakis-meso-(4-ethyleneglycol-2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl) porphyrin (PORF-TEG), results in rapid activation of the cell death machinery. PORF-TEG, although primarily localized in lysosomes, induces mitochondria-driven apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis is accompanied by immediate and sustained activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transient activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Conversely, the inhibition of p38 by PD 169316 or SB202190 and by the p38α dominant-negative mutant as well as the deletion of the p38α gene (MEFs-KO) protected cells from apoptosis, whereas inhibition of JNK did not. Activation of the p38 signaling pathway occurs upstream of caspase activation. In addition, preincubation of cells with scavengers of reactive oxygen species attenuated p38 and caspase activation and increased cell survival, thus connecting reactive oxygen species formation with the activation of the p38 pathway. Later events included degradation of Bcl-2, activation of tBid, and cleavage of Bad and Mcl-1. The data suggest a key role for p38 MAPK in PORF-TEG-photoinduced apoptosis."

Though thought to primarily interact with steroid receptors, the p160 proteins can also interact with non-nuclear receptor transcription factors including the MAP kinase effector proteins Ets. Here, we observed that in breast cancer cells resistant and insensitive to endocrine treatment, the growth factor EGF induced Ets-2 but not Ets-1 transcriptional regulation of the oncogene myc. Ets-2 regulation of myc was found to be reliant on the p160 proteins SRC-1 and SRC-3. In support of these molecular observations, strong associations were observed between the transcription factor, Ets-2 and its coactivator SRC-1 (P<0.01) and the target gene myc (P<0.0001) in a cohort of breast cancer patients with locally advanced disease. Expression of Ets-2, SRC-1 and c-Myc individually all associated with reduced disease-free survival (P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.002 respectively). There was no association between SRC-3 and disease-free survival (P=0.707). SRC-1 can utilize MAP kinase effector transcription factor Ets-2 to regulate the production of the oncogene myc. These signalling mechanisms may be important in the development of steroid resistant/independent breast cancer."

A number of bacteria that can colonize humans make use of Neu5Ac as a nutrient source; for example, the intestinal bacterium Escherichia coli can grow on Neu5Ac as a sole carbon source (4Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 845-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The intestinal mucous layer is rich in sialic acids, and E. coli genes required for sialic acid catabolism are induced in this environment and are important for colonization (5Chang D.E. Smalley D.J.

Directly downstream of the transporter genes (siaPQM) is an uncharacterized gene, HI0148 (Fig. 1), which encodes a predicted periplasmic protein that has been suggested to contain 7 Kelch motifs and be involved in sialic acid catabolism (15Kolker E.

In E. coli the orthologue of this gene is yjhT, which is the second gene in a potential three gene operon, yjhATS, whose expression is induced by sialic acid (16Condemine G. Berrier C. Plumbridge J. Ghazi A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The first gene in this operon, yjhA, has already been demonstrated to encode a Neu5Ac-specific porin in the outer membrane of E. coli and has been renamed nanC (16Condemine G. Berrier C. Plumbridge J. Ghazi A. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These data suggest a sialic acid-related function for the yjhT/HI0148 gene products.

Here we describe the function of YjhT as a representative of this family of uncharacterized periplasmic proteins from pathogenic bacteria and demonstrate that this protein functions, unexpectedly, as a sialic acid mutarotase. We report the structure of YjhT and identify amino acid residues important for enzyme activity in vitro. In addition, we provide in vivo data consistent with our suggested function for this protein. Cloning and Expression of Native and Mutant YjhT-His6 Proteins–The yjhT gene was amplified from genomic DNA of E. coli K12 MG1655 using KOD Hot Start polymerase (EMD Biosciences) and primers EcyjhT-NdeI and EcyjhT-XhoI (supplemental Table 1). The NdeI- and XhoI-cut PCR product was cloned into pET21b and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting construct (pES5) encodes a C-terminally His6-tagged variant of YjhT, in which the tag is spaced from the protein by a Leu-Glu dipeptide. yjhT mutant alleles were generated using a modified QuikChange™ method (17Zheng L. Baumann U. Reymond J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e115Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar) using pES5 as a template and KOD Hot Start polymerase. The mutagenic oligonucleotides used are listed insupplemental Table 1. Native and mutant YjhT proteins were expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS, which was grown at 25 °C in 1.5 liters of LB with antibiotics to an OD650 of 0.4–0.5 before induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. Cells were harvested and incubated in SET buffer (0.5 m sucrose, 5 mm EDTA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 600 μg/ml lysozyme) at 30 °C for 1 h to release the periplasmic fraction, which was then clarified by centrifugation and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.5. All YjhT variants were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography on a 1-ml HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare) and dialyzed against double distilled water containing 100 mm NaCl; proteins were ∼95% pure as judged based on SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm (A280) using a theoretical molar absorption coefficient of 73,540 (Y309A mutant) or 74,820 cm-1 m-1 (all other variants). A SeMet derivative of YjhT was prepared as described previously (18Ducros V.M. Lewis R.J. Verma C.S. Dodson E.J. Leonard G. Turkenburg J.P. Murshudov G.N. Wilkinson A.J. Brannigan J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by growing BL21 (DE3) pLysS pES5 cells in double-strength M9 (19Neidhardt F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with selenomethionine; the expression and purification procedures for this protein were those used for native YjhT. Throughout this paper we will refer to the concentration of YjhT as that of the monomer. The masses of all the recombinant proteins were confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry (see supplemental Experimental Procedures), which demonstrated that all had been correctly processed by removal of their signal peptide. Crystallization Procedure–Purified SeMet-substituted YjhT was dialyzed against double distilled water and concentrated to 12 mg/ml. Crystallization experiments utilized the vapor diffusion method and a MOSQUITO nanoliter dispensing robot to set up sitting drops. Successful crystallization conditions were identified using the PACT screen (20Newman J. Egan D. Walter T.S. Meged R. Berry I. Ben Jelloul M. Sussman J.L. Stuart D.I. Perrakis A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 1426-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Crystals for data collection were grown from drops made up of 150 nl of SeMet-substituted YjhT and 150 nl of 200 mm sodium malonate, 0.1 m BisTris propane, pH 7.5, and 20% w/v polyethylene glycol 3350. Data Collection and Structure Solution–A single wavelength data set extending to a resolution of 1.5 Å with a high redundancy was collected from a crystal of SeMet substituted YjhT at the ESRF, Grenoble, France, on beamline ID14-4 (Table 1). From the SAD signal with a resolution cutoff at 2.5 Å, the programs SHELXC and SHELXD (21Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar) led to the location of all six selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit. Refinement of the selenium atom positions using the program MLPHARE provided experimental phase probability distributions in terms of the Hendrikson-Lattman coefficients. These served as restraints during the ARP/wARP-REFMAC model building process (22Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), which led to a model with 587 of 714 residues built and sequence coverage of 99%. The model was completed and refined in iterative cycles of REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar) and manual modeling in COOT (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (22534) Google Scholar). In subunit A there is clear electron density for residues 1–225 and 229–349, with a disordered surface loop from 226 to 228. In subunit B, all residues from 1 to 349 are visible. The C terminus, residues 350–357, is disordered in both subunits. Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code 2uvk).

Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) spectra of Neu5Ac (1 mm) with YjhT (10 μm) were acquired with 8 scans and a 7-s saturation time with saturation at 0 ppm (saturation transfer) or at -20000 Hz (reference spectrum). A difference spectrum was obtained by subtracting the saturation transfer spectrum from the reference spectrum. One-dimensional spectra for the time courses were acquired with 128 scans and a 1-s delay between scans. Initially a “0” time point was acquired of 1 mm sialyllactose (α(2–3) and α(2–6) mixture from human milk; Sigma). Then 0.6 units of Clostridium perfringens sialidase (type V, Sigma) and 0.5 μm YjhT (or YjhT mutant) was added. Acquisition of the first spectrum took 5 min and was completed ∼7 min after addition of the enzymes. Two-dimensional NOESY spectra were acquired with 1 mm Neu5Ac and 10 μm YjhT, 64 scans, and a mixing time of 100 ms. The addition of protein (sialidase and/or YjhT) and/or sugars did not alter the pH of the buffer. One-dimensional spectra were processed using Topspin (Bruker Bio-Spin) and SigmaPlot, whereas two-dimensional spectra were processed using NMRPipe (29Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G.

Construction of Deletion Mutants–For this study we used three strains from the Keio collection (31Baba T. Ara T. Hasegawa M. Takai Y. Okumura Y. Baba M. Datsenko K.A. Tomita M. Wanner B.L. Mori H.

We removed the KanR cassette by transformation with pCP20 followed by plasmid curing as described previously (32Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (10838) Google Scholar). Removal of the KanR cassette was confirmed by PCR, and the ΔyjhS and ΔyjhT regions were sequenced. Of note, the ΔyjhS strain contained an additional base in the Scar peptide-coding sequence, resulting in an extended Scar peptide about 60 amino acids long. Neu5Ac Uptake Assay–For [14C]Neu5Ac uptake assays, single colonies from freshly streaked LB plates were inoculated in LB medium and grown for 8 h. Cells were harvested, washed once in M9 minimal medium, and inoculated into M9 with 0.4% v/v glycerol to an initial OD650 of 0.05 and grown overnight. Cells were harvested, washed three times in M9, and then inoculated into M9 Neu5Ac (1 mg/ml) to an initial OD650 of 0.1 and allowed to grow until mid-log phase (OD650 ∼0.4), when they were harvested, washed four times in M9, and finally resuspended to an OD650 of 2 in 1 ml of M9 salts (no carbon source added), and stored on ice. To assay sialic acid uptake, such suspensions were diluted to an OD650 of 0.3 in M9 salts prewarmed at 37 °C and incubated with stirring at 37 °C for 2 min, when uptake was initiated by adding [14C]Neu5Ac (Sigma) to a final concentration of 0.25 μm.

YjhT Is a Periplasmic Protein That Interacts Weakly with Sialic Acid–To investigate the function of this family of uncharacterized proteins, we studied the protein from the model bacterium E. coli K12 MG1655 (37Blattner F.R.

The YjhT protein was overexpressed and extracted from E. coli periplasm as a C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged protein and then purified to apparent homogeneity in a single step using nickel affinity chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1, inset). The molecular weight of recombinant YjhT was examined using electrospray mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. 1), which revealed two distinct sets of m/z peaks that were identified as having masses of 38,685 ± 4 and 77,371 ± 8. These are consistent with the monomeric (38,686) and dimeric (77,372) forms of the C-terminally His-tagged version of YjhT that had been processed to remove the 19-amino acid signal peptide upon export to the periplasm. To examine whether YjhT was able to interact with Neu5Ac, we used 1H NMR spectroscopy, a method used successfully to study other aspects of sialic acid biology (39Moustafa I. Connaris H. Taylor M. Zaitsev V. Wilson J.C. Kiefel M.J. von Itzstein M. Taylor G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 40819-40826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A 1H NMR spectrum of Neu5Ac is shown in Fig. 2 (lower spectrum) where peaks have been assigned based on published spectra of Neu5Ac (40Brown E.B. Brey Jr., W.S. Weltner Jr., W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 399: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The STD (28Mayer M. Meyer B. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) spectrum of YjhT in the presence of Neu5Ac (Fig. 2, upper spectrum) demonstrates an interaction between YjhT and Neu5Ac. This STD signal was not observed with Neu5Ac alone, and STD signals were not observed in the presence of other sugars, specifically galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylmannosamine (data not shown). The ability to interact with Neu5Ac, the periplasmic localization and the predicted β-propeller structure (15Kolker E. Makarova K.S. Shabalina S. Picone A.F. Purvine S. Holzman T. Cherny T. Armbruster D. Munson Jr., R.S. Kolesov G. Frishman D. Galperin M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2353-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), suggested two potential functions for YjhT. The first, as a lectin-like multivalent sialic-binding protein, such as the Psathyrella velutina lectin (PVL) (41Cioci G. Mitchell E.P. Chazalet V. Debray H. Oscarson S. Lahmann M. Gautier C. Breton C. Perez S. Imberty A. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 1575-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), was not supported by a ligand binding assay that detects stable complexes between protein and Neu5Ac (supplemental Fig. 2). The second, as a sialidase (42Varghese J.N. Laver W.G. Colman P.M. Nature. 1983; 303: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 43Crennell S. Takimoto T. Portner A. Taylor G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1068-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), was tested using 1H NMR spectroscopy and sialyllactose as a substrate. Only in the presence of a sialidase was there release of Neu5Ac from sialyllactose. In the presence of YjhT or with no added protein, sialyllactose was stable after overnight incubation (supplemental Fig. 3). These data suggest a novel function for this periplasmic protein related to its interaction with Neu5Ac. YjhT Has a Neu5Ac Mutarotase Activity–In vertebrates, sialic acid is mostly present as part of larger sialoglycoconjugates, where it is linked to the rest of the macromolecule exclusively by α-linkages (2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Free sialic acid is released by sialidase action as the α-anomer, which mutarotates spontaneously into β-Neu5Ac, which is the most abundant anomer at equilibrium (over 90%) (39Moustafa I. Connaris H.

Brown E.B. Barrett J.M. Brey Jr., W.S. Weltner Jr., W. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4533-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneous mutarotation rate of Neu5Ac is relatively slow, for example at pH 5.4 the t0.5 is 80 min (45Friebolin H. Kunzelmann P. Supp M. Brossmer R. Keilich G. Ziegler D. Tetrahedron Lett. 1981; 22: 1383-1386Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Given that the doubling time of an E. coli cell (20 min) is faster than the spontaneous mutarotation rate, we reasoned that bacteria competing for a limited supply of sialic acid might gain a selective advantage by being able to mutarotate the α-anomer more quickly. We investigated the possible Neu5Ac mutarotase activity of YjhT using 1H NMR, a technique used previously to characterize other sugar mutarotases (46Graille M. Baltaze J.P. Leulliot N. Liger D.

https://openalex.org/W1985243017,"Objectives Peptides delivered on the surface of influenza virosomes have been shown to induce solid humoral immune responses in experimental animals. High titers of peptide-specific antibodies were also induced in a phase 1a clinical trial in volunteers immunized with virosomal formulations of two peptides derived from the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) and the apical membrane antigen 1 (AMA-1) of Plasmodium falciparum. The main objective of this study was to perform a detailed immunological and functional analysis of the CSP-specific antibodies elicited in this phase 1a trial. Methodology/Principal Findings 46 healthy malaria-naïve adults were immunized with virosomal formulations of two peptide-phosphatidylethanolamine conjugates, one derived from the NANP repeat region of P. falciparum CSP (designated UK-39) the other from P. falciparum AMA-1 (designated AMA49-C1). The two antigens were delivered in two different concentrations, alone and in combination. One group was immunized with empty virosomes as control. In this report we show a detailed analysis of the antibody response against UK-39. Three vaccinations with a 10 µg dose of UK-39 induced high titers of sporozoite-binding antibodies in all volunteers. This IgG response was affinity maturated and long-lived. Co-administration of UK-39 and AMA49-C1 loaded virosomes did not interfere with the immunogenicity of UK-39. Purified total IgG from UK-39 immunized volunteers inhibited sporozoite migration and invasion of hepatocytes in vitro. Sporozoite inhibition closely correlated with titers measured in immunogenicity assays. Conclusions Virosomal delivery of a short, conformationally constrained peptide derived from P. falciparum CSP induced a long-lived parasite-inhibitory antibody response in humans. Combination with a second virosomally-formulated peptide derived from P. falciparum AMA-1 did not interfere with the immunogenicity of either peptide, demonstrating the potential of influenza virosomes as a versatile, human-compatible antigen delivery platform for the development of multivalent subunit vaccines.

https://openalex.org/W2144394638,"Background Microsporidia are intracellular parasites that are highly-derived relatives of fungi. They have compacted genomes and, despite a high rate of sequence evolution, distantly related species can share high levels of gene order conservation. To date, only two species have been analysed in detail, and data from one of these largely consists of short genomic fragments. It is therefore difficult to determine how conservation has been maintained through microsporidian evolution, and impossible to identify whether certain regions are more prone to genomic stasis. Principal Findings Here, we analyse three large fragments of the Enterocytozoon bieneusi genome (in total 429 kbp), a species of medical significance. A total of 296 ORFs were identified, annotated and their context compared with Encephalitozoon cuniculi and Antonospora locustae. Overall, a high degree of conservation was found between all three species, and interestingly the level of conservation was similar in all three pairwise comparisons, despite the fact that A. locustae is more distantly related to E. cuniculi and E. bieneusi than either are to each other. Conclusions/Significance Any two genes that are found together in any pair of genomes are more likely to be conserved in the third genome as well, suggesting that a core of genes tends to be conserved across the entire group. The mechanisms of rearrangments identified among microsporidian genomes were consistent with a very slow evolution of their architecture, as opposed to the very rapid sequence evolution reported for these parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1990794773,"Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the antitumour activity of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) against colorectal cancer will allow the development of more effective and specific chemopreventative agents. Modulation of the NF-κB pathway has been implicated as a key effector of the antitumour effect of aspirin, but the effects of non-aspirin NSAIDs on this pathway have yet to be fully defined. Here, we demonstrate that sulindac, sulindac sulfone and indomethacin activate the NF-κB pathway in colorectal cancer cells, as determined by western blot analysis of cytoplasmic levels of IκBα and immunocytochemical analysis of nuclear NF-κB/RelA. Furthermore, we show that all of these NSAIDs induce nucleolar translocation of the RelA subunit of NF-κB. Using RelA deleted for the previously described nucleolar localization signal, we demonstrate that this response is causally involved in the apoptotic effects of these agents. Finally, we demonstrate that NSAID-mediated nucleolar translocation of RelA is associated with downregulation of NF-κB-driven transcription and of the NF-κB target gene, ICAM-1. These data identify nucleolar translocation of RelA and the associated repression of the NF-κB-driven transcription as a central molecular mechanism of NSAID-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. As well as providing new understanding of the molecular determinants of RelA function, these findings also have relevance to the development of novel chemotherapeutic and chemopreventative agents."

We have examined the effects of these individual mutations on structural transitions in the regulatory N-domain of cTnC triggered by Ca2+ binding and dissociation. This study was carried out with a double mutant or triple mutants of cTnC, reconstituted into troponin with tryptophanless cTnI and cTnT. The double mutant, cTnC(L12W/N51C) labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS at Cys-51, served as a control to monitor Ca2+-induced opening and closing of the N-domain by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). The triple mutants contained both L12W and N51C labeled with 1,5-IAEDANS, and either L29Q or G159D. Both mutations had minimal effects on the equilibrium distance between Trp-12 and Cys-51-AEDANS in the absence or presence of bound Ca2+. L29Q had no effect on the closing rate of the N-domain triggered by release of Ca2+, but reduced the Ca2+-induced opening rate. G159D reduced both the closing and opening rates. Previous results showed that the closing rate of cTnC N-domain triggered by Ca2+ dissociation was substantially enhanced by PKA phosphorylation of cTnI. This rate enhancement was abolished by L29Q or G159D. These mutations alter the kinetics of structural transitions in the regulatory N-domain of cTnC that are involved in either activation (L29Q) or deactivation (G159D).

These proteins are located in the thin filament. Contraction occurs when the myosin head in the thick filament interacts with actin causing the two filaments to slide past each other. The troponin complex in the thin filament regulates the actinmyosin interaction. Ca2+ binding to the single site in the N-domain of cTnC initiates the activation process. cTnC has two globular regions, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. The N-domain has only one Ca2+ binding site (site II) and the C-domain contains two binding site (binding sites III and IV). Ca2+ binding to site II in the presence of cTnI induces an open conformation of the N-domain to expose a hydrophobic patch in the domain (1Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M.

Once exposed, the hydrophobic patch binds strongly with the regulatory region of cTnI. This strong interaction pulls cTnI away from actin and relieves the inhibition of actomyosin ATPase and muscle contraction. This regulation process is further fine-tuned with phosphorylation of cTnI serine 23 and serine 24 by protein kinase A (PKA) (4Solaro R.J. Page E.F. Harry A. Solaro R.J. Handbook of Physiology.

Therefore, substituting a nonpolar residue with a polar residue in this region may potentially interrupt the cTnC-cTnI interaction and the Ca2+-induced structural transition of the cTnC N-domain. In an in vitro peptide array experiment, replacing Leu-29 with glutamine weakened the interaction between cTnI and cTnC (32Schmidtmann A. Lindow C. Villard S. Heuser A. Mugge A. Gessner R. Granier C. Jaquet K. Febs. J. 2005; 272: 6087-6097Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Glycine at position 159 of cTnC is located at the third position from to the C terminus. The C-domain of cTnC is generally considered to play a structural role in troponin since the exchange of bound Mg2+ with Ca2+ in the C-domain is too slow to participate in muscle regulation (33Rosenfeld S.S. Taylor E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 242-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that the interaction of this region of cTnC with cTnI has a significant impact on the force of cardiac myofilament (34Solaro R.J. Montgomery D.M. Wang L. Burkart E.M. Ke Y. Vahebi S. Buttrick P. J. Nucl. Cardiol. 2002; 9: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Considering the anti-parallel structural arrangement of cTnC and cTnI in troponin, the C-domain of cTnC may interact with the N-terminal segment of cTnI where multiple PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites are located. Thus, replacing glycine with an acidic residue at position 159 may modify the interaction between this region of cTnC and cTnI.In this study we investigated the effects of L29Q and G159D mutations in cTnC on the structural dynamics and kinetics of Ca2+-induced structural transition in the N-domain of cTnC, using reconstituted troponin preparations and a combination of FRET equilibrium and kinetic measurements. Our rationale is that, in addition to the potential structural effects, these mutations may also have a significant impact on the dynamics of the Ca2+-induced N-domain conformational changes of cTnC. Kinetic experiments showed that both mutations significantly altered the kinetics of structural transition and eliminated the inotropic effect of PKA phosphorylation of cTnI on the transition. These findings suggest an antagonistic role of these cTnC cardiomyopathy-related mutations of cTnC in cardiac thin filament regulation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein PreparationsA recombinant tryptophanless cTnT mutant (W239F/W289F) and a recombinant tryptophanless cTnI mutant (W192F) were generated as in a previous report (35Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Stagg S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8686-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Both proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (Invitrogen) under isopropyl-1-thio-d-galactopyranoside induction. The expressed proteins were purified as previously described (36Dong W.J. Xing J. Robinson J.M. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 314: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Recombinant single cysteine and single tryptophan mutants, cTnC(L12W/N51C), cTnC(L12W/N51C/L29Q), and cTnC(L12W/N51C/G159D), were generated from a cTnC cDNA clone from chicken slow skeletal muscle as previously reported (1Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Protein purification and modification of the single cysteine residue with IAEDANS ((iodoacetamidoethyl)aminonaphtha-lene-1-ulfonic acid)) were performed with the procedures described in the previous report (35Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Stagg S. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8686-8692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The identities of all mutant proteins and labeled proteins were verified using electrospray mass spectrometric analysis. The biochemical activity of the labeled cTnC and tryptophanless cTnI and cTnT mutants was tested by Ca2+-dependent regulation of acto-S1 ATPase activity. Measurements were performed at 30 °C in 60 mm KCl, 5.6 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 30 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, and either 500 μm CaCl2 for the +Ca2+ state or 1 mm EGTA for the -Ca2+ state. The protein concentrations used were 4.2 μm F-actin, 0.6 μm Tm, 0.6 μm Tn, and 0.5 μm S1. The amounts of inorganic phosphate released were determined colorimetrically according to the reported procedure (37Wang C.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 509-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Absorption was measured at 630 nm with a Beckman DU-640 spectrophotometer. Troponin complex was prepared by incubating 6 μm of cTnC mutants and 8 μm tryptophanless cTnI and 8 μm of tryptophanless cTnT on ice for 30 min before measurements were carried out. The final buffer contained 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, and 0.2 m KCl, plus various amounts of Ca2+ or EGTA as required. All fluorescence measurements were carried out at 10.0 °C.PKA Phosphorylation of cTnIRecombinant tryptophanless cTnI was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA, using a cTnC affinity column as previously described (19Finley N. Abbott M.B. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Dong W. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Howarth J.W. Rance M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Rosevear P.R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified cTnI mutant was loaded on a cTnC affinity column equilibrated in 50 mm KH2PO4 at pH 7.0, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, and 125 units PKA/mg cTnI. ATP was added to the column to initiate the reaction. After 30 min at 30 °C, the column was washed with a buffer containing 50 mm Mops at pH 7.0, 500 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. Phosphorylated cTnI was eluted with a buffer containing 6 m urea, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm Mops (pH 7.0). The extent of phosphorylation was quantified by both mass spectral measurements and treatment of the sample with alkaline phosphatase, followed by determination of inorganic phosphate using the EnzChek Phosphate Assay kit (Molecular Probes) (38Dong W.J. Xing J. Chandra M. Solaro J. Cheung H.C. Proteins. 2000; 41: 438-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the two PKA sites in cTnI was >90%. The same amount of nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated tryptophanless cTnI was used for in the preparation of reconstituted troponin.Fluorescence MeasurementsSteady-state measurements were carried out on an ISS PCI photon-counting spectrofluorometer equipped with a micro titrator at 10 ± 0.1 °C (1Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). FRET was used in titration experiments to monitor Ca2+ induced cTnC N-domain opening. For Ca2+ titration, 1.0 ml of the reconstituted complex (1 μm of labeled cTnC mutant) was in a buffer containing 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 m KCl. The fluorescence intensity of the donor (tryptophan) was monitored at 340 nm with an excitation of 295 nm. In a typical titration experiment, up to 90 data points were acquired after successively injecting aliquots of 5 μl of a Ca2+-EGTA buffer. Free [Ca2+] was calculated by an in-house program, using stability constants given by Fabiato (39Fabiato A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 157: 378-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). For both emission spectra and titration measurements, the donor (tryptophan) fluorescence of a donor-only protein (cTnC(L12W/N51C)) was first determined, followed by determination of the donor fluorescence of the corresponding donor-acceptor protein (cTnC(L12W/N51C)AEDANS) at the same protein concentration and identical conditions. All measurements were background subtracted. The background was obtained under identical experimental conditions by collecting background fluorescence from an identical sample solution in which cTnC was omitted. The procedures previously described were used to convert titration data to FRET efficiency and intersite distances (40Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42394-42402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).Fluorescence intensity decays were measured in the time domain using an IBH 5000U fluorescence lifetime system equipped with a 295 nm LED as the light source. Fluorescence intensity decays of the donor from the donor-alone and donor-acceptor samples were collected with a time-correlated single photon counting system associated with the IBH 5000U under identical experimental condition and were corrected for background signals using an identical solution in which either cTnC(L12W/N51C) or cTnC(L12W/N51C)AEDANS was omitted. We previously found that background correction was critical for distance calculation with tryptophan as the energy donor. Even a small amount of contaminating tryptophan-contained protein would contribute significantly to the observed fluorescence intensity and consequently skew the calculated titration curves. Background subtracted decays data were used to calculate intersite distances between donor and acceptor as in previous studies (16Dong W.J. Chandra M. Xing J. She M. Solaro R.J. Cheung H.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6754-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 41She M. Xing J. Dong W.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar).Stopped-Flow MeasurementsKinetic measurements were carried out at 10.0 °C in a KinTek F2004 spectrometer with a 1.5-ms dead time. In Ca2+ dissociation experiments monitored by FRET, a protein sample saturated with Ca2+ in a buffer of 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0 containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, and 0.16 mm Ca2+ (pCa 3.8) was mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer in which Ca2+ was omitted and 2 mm EGTA was added. After mixing, [protein] = 2 μm and [EGTA] = 1000 μm. In Ca2+ binding experiments, a protein sample in a buffer containing 50 mm Mops, pH 7.0 containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m KCl, and 30–50 μm EGTA was mixed with an equal volume of the same buffer plus 500 μm Ca2+. After mixing, [protein] = 2 μm and [Ca2+] = 250 μm. As in equilibrium FRET experiments, the time-dependent change of donor tryptophan fluorescence intensity was first determined from a donor-only sample (unlabeled cTnC mutants), followed by determination of the time-dependent fluorescence intensity for the corresponding donor-acceptor sample (AEDANS-labeled cTnC mutants). Similar to steady-state measurements, all measurements were corrected by subtracting background fluorescence of the sample in which cTnC was omitted. 8–10 kinetic tracings were collected for each set of donor only and donor-acceptor samples and the averages of each set of samples were used to calculate the time-dependent FRET efficiency, from which the time-dependent FRET distance was calculated (40Dong W.J. Robinson J.M. Xing J. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42394-42402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar).RESULTSTo examine whether mutants cTnI and cTnT, and labeled cTnC have the same regulatory function as wild-type proteins, Ca2+ regulation of the actin-activated S1-ATPase activity assay was carried out. The results are summarized in Table 1. The ATPase activity of S1 in the presence of actin, but in the absence of troponin and Tm was taken as 100%. The Ca2+ activation was 0.718 for the control preparation containing wild-type cTn. The Ca2+ activations for the other two preparations containing mutants of cTnI and cTnT, and labeled cTnC mutant were similar to that of the control, suggesting that the effects of cTnI and cTnT mutations and labeling of cTnC on the Ca2+ regulatory activity were negligible.TABLE 1Effects of modified proteins on reconstituted actomyosin ATPase activityTroponin complexesATPase activityCa2+ activationEGTACa2+cTnC(wt)-cTnI(wt)-cTnT(wt)0.0110.0390.718cTnC(wt)-cTnI(nw)-cTnT(nw)0.0120.0420.714cTnC(L12W/N51C)AEDANS-cTnI(nw)-cTnT(nw)0.0140.0380.631 Open table in a new tab To verify the stability and stoichiometry of the mutant troponin complex reconstituted with labeled cTnC, tryptophanless cTnI and cTnT, SDS-PAGE and native gel analysis were exploited. The troponin complexes were reconstituted by incubating labeled cTnC mutants, tryptophanless cTnI and cTnT in a molar ratio of 1.0:1.2:1.2 on ice for 30 min, and then dialyzing against the working buffer containing 50 mm Mops(pH 7.0), 1 mm DTT, and 0.1 m KCl in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove all insoluble extra cTnI and cTnT before native and SDS-PAGE analysis. Electrophoresis analysis showed that both wild-type and mutant troponin complexes existed as a single complex with the correct stoichiometry (the molar ratio of cTnC:cTnI: cTnT was 1:1:1, based on density analysis using Bio-Rad Quantity One Software) in the samples (Fig. 1). Multiple experiments were performed on the samples prepared within 2 weeks, and no protein degradation was observed by electrophoresis analysis.Ca2+-induced cTnC N-domain OpeningResidue 12 of cTnC is located at the N-terminal end of the helix A and residue 51 is located in the linker between helices B and C. The distance between these two sites is expected to increase upon Ca2+ binding to the N-domain of cTnC in the presence of cTnI. The AEDANS labeled cTnC(L12W/N51C) was used to monitor this structural transition. Steady-state measurements showed that in the troponin complex the fluorescence intensity of donor tryptophan in a cTnC(L12W/N51C) sample at 340 nm was insensitive to Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site of cTnC N-domain (Fig. 2A). This donor fluorescence intensity was quenched by 50% when the acceptor AEDANS was attached to Cys-51 indicating a high efficiency of FRET and suggesting a close proximity between the two residues. The second emission band at 480 nm is the acceptor fluorescence in cTnC(L12W/N51C)AEDANS arising from energy transfer from W12 to AEDANS. Upon Ca2+ binding to the regulatory site of cTnC, the previously quenched donor fluorescence was substantially recovered, accompanied by a decrease of the acceptor fluorescence (open square, Fig. 2A). These reciprocal changes indicate a Ca2+-induced reduction of FRET and an increase in the distance between the two sites. The magnitude of the distances was quantified from data obtained from time-resolved fluorescence measurements (Fig. 2B). As expected, Ca2+ had little effect on the intensity decay of the donor from the donor-only sample (Fig. 2B), but the presence of Ca2+ significantly slowed down the donor decay curve. These changes of the intensity decay suggest a Ca2+-induced decrease in FRET and an increase in the inter-site distance. The data were analyzed in terms of a distribution of the distances. The mean distances between residues 12 and 51 derived from the distribution of distances are given in Table 2. With control cTnC, the FRET distance in the apo-N-domain was 22.6 Å. This distance compares favorably with the Cα-Cα distance (20.4 Å) between the two residues in the NMR cTnC structures (42Spyracopoulos L. Li M.X. Sia S.K. Gagne S.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12138-12146Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the Ca2+-saturated state in which the N-domain contains a bound Ca2+, the FRET distance increased by 6.3 to 28.9 Å. The corresponding distance from NMR structures (3Li M.X. Spyracopoulos L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8289-8298Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) is 29.5 Å, and from the crystal structure of the core domain of cardiac troponin (43Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar) is 29.4 Å. It is noted that the FRET distances reported here for control cTnC in cTn were 3.7 and 3.1 Å longer for the apo and Ca2+-bound states, respectively, than in our previous report (1Dong W.J. Xing J. Villain M. Hellinger M. Robinson J.M. Chandra M. Solaro R.J. Umeda P.K. Cheung H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31382-31390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This discrepancy arises from failure in the previous work to correct for background signals contributed from a small amount of tryptophan-containing contamination. The magnitude of the Ca2+-induced change in distance was very similar in both studies.FIGURE 2Fluorescence of cardiac troponin reconstituted with cTnC(L12W/N51C) (donor-only) and cTnC(L12W/N51C)AEDANS (donor-acceptor).

https://openalex.org/W2141212596,"The ability of tumor cells to metastasize is increasingly viewed as an interaction between the primary tumor and host tissues. Deletion of the p19/Arf or p53 tumor suppressor genes accelerates malignant progression and metastatic spread of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced squamous cell carcinomas, providing a model system to address mechanisms of metastasis. Here, we show that benign pre-metastatic papillomas from wild-type mice trigger lymphangiogenesis within draining lymph nodes, whereas there is no growth of primary tumor lymphatic vessels. Lymph node lymphangiogenesis is greatly accelerated in papilloma-bearing p19/Arf- or p53-deficient mice, which coincides with the greater propensity of these tumors to progress to carcinomas and to metastasize. The extent of accumulation of B cells within the tumor-draining lymph nodes of wild-type mice predicted the level of lymph node lymphangiogenesis and metastatic potential. Arf or p53 deficiency strongly accelerated lymph node immune cell accumulation, in a manner that was associated with the extent of lymph node lymphatic sinus growth. This immune cell accumulation and lymph node lymphangiogenesis phenotype identifies host anti-tumor responses that could drive metastatic spread of cancers via the lymphatics."
https://openalex.org/W2113983782,"The Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) is the most cost-effective measures to control vaccine-preventable diseases. Currently, the EPI schedule is similar for HIV-infected children; the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) should considerably prolong their life expectancy.To evaluate the persistence of antibodies to the EPI vaccines in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children who previously received these vaccines in routine clinical practice, we conducted a cross-sectional study of children, aged 18 to 36 months, born to HIV-infected mothers and living in Central Africa. We tested blood samples for antibodies to the combined diphtheria, tetanus, and whole-cell pertussis (DTwP), the measles and the oral polio (OPV) vaccines. We enrolled 51 HIV-infected children of whom 33 were receiving ART, and 78 HIV-uninfected children born to HIV-infected women. A lower proportion of HIV-infected children than uninfected children had antibodies to the tested antigens with the exception of the OPV types 1 and 2. This difference was substantial for the measles vaccine (20% of the HIV-infected children and 56% of the HIV-exposed uninfected children, p<0.0001). We observed a high risk of low antibody levels for all EPI vaccines, except OPV types 1 and 2, in HIV-infected children with severe immunodeficiency (CD4(+) T cells <25%).Children were examined at a time when their antibody concentrations to EPI vaccines would have still not undergone significant decay. However, we showed that the antibody concentrations were lowered in HIV-infected children. Moreover, antibody concentration after a single dose of the measles vaccine was substantially lower than expected, particularly low in HIV-infected children with low CD4(+) T cell counts. This study supports the need for a second dose of the measles vaccine and for a booster dose of the DTwP and OPV vaccines to maintain the antibody concentrations in HIV-infected and HIV-exposed uninfected children."
https://openalex.org/W2134803801,"Apoptin, a small protein from the chicken anemia virus, has attracted attention because of its specificity in killing tumor cells. Localization of apoptin in the nucleus of tumor cells has been shown to be vital for proapoptotic activity, however, targeted expression of apoptin in the nucleus of normal cells does not harm the cells, indicating that nuclear localization of apoptin is insufficient for its cytotoxicity. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that apoptin interacts with the SH3 domain of p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K), through its proline-rich region. Apoptin derivatives devoid of this proline-rich region do not interact with p85, are unable to activate PI3-K, and show impaired apoptosis induction. Moreover, apoptin mutants containing the proline-rich domain are sufficient to elevate PI3-K activity and to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Downregulation of p85 leads to nuclear exclusion of apoptin and impairs cell death induction, indicating that interaction with the p85 PI3-K subunit essentially contributes to the cytotoxic activity of apoptin."
https://openalex.org/W2027283107,"Background Evaluating diagnostic and early detection biomarkers requires comparing serum protein concentrations among biosamples ascertained from subjects with and without cancer. Efforts are generally made to standardize blood processing and storage conditions for cases and controls, but blood sample collection conditions cannot be completely controlled. For example, blood samples from cases are often obtained from persons aware of their diagnoses, and collected after fasting or in surgery, whereas blood samples from some controls may be obtained in different conditions, such as a clinic visit. By measuring the effects of differences in collection conditions on three different markers, we investigated the potential of these effects to bias validation studies. Methodology and Principle Findings We analyzed serum concentrations of three previously studied putative ovarian cancer serum biomarkers–CA 125, Prolactin and MIF–in healthy women, women with ovarian cancer undergoing gynecologic surgery, women undergoing surgery for benign ovary pathology, and women undergoing surgery with pathologically normal ovaries. For women undergoing surgery, a blood sample was collected either in the clinic 1 to 39 days prior to surgery, or on the day of surgery after anesthesia was administered but prior to the surgical procedure, or both. We found that one marker, prolactin, was dramatically affected by collection conditions, while CA 125 and MIF were unaffected. Prolactin levels were not different between case and control groups after accounting for the conditions of sample collection, suggesting that sample ascertainment could explain some or all of the previously reported results about its potential as a biomarker for ovarian cancer. Conclusions Biomarker validation studies should use standardized collection conditions, use multiple control groups, and/or collect samples from cases prior to influence of diagnosis whenever feasible to detect and correct for potential biases associated with sample collection."

https://openalex.org/W2037362981,"Germ-line mutations of the BRCA2 gene cause inherited susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers. BRCA2 contains two nuclear localization signals, predominantly localizes in the nucleus and plays significant roles in DNA double-strand break repair. Recently, we reported that BRCA2 localizes to the centrosomes during the S and early M phases of the cell cycle. In this study, for the first time, we identified a functional nuclear export sequence (NES1; 1383DLSDLTFLEVA1393) in BRCA2. The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-NES1 fusion protein was localized in the cytoplasm and could be blocked by the chromosomal region maintenance 1-specific export inhibitor leptomycin B. Mutation of a leucine residue in the NES1 motif to alanine (L1384A) resulted in both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of the GFP-NES1 fusion protein and a nuclear accumulation of ectopic full-length BRCA2-FLAG. Moreover, treatment of cells with leptomycin B decreased centrosomal localization of BRCA2. Finally, by microinjection of an anti-BRCA2 antibody into the cytoplasm of HeLa S3 cells, we found that depletion of normal BRCA2 proteins in the cytoplasm leads to centrosome amplification and binucleated cells. Our results suggest that disruption of the NES function by genetic changes results in deregulation of BRCA2 export, which ultimately leads to centrosome disorder."

Funders of the research were identified in 38% of stories, financial ties of the researchers were reported in 11% of stories, and 5% reported financial ties of sources quoted. Of 73 stories not reporting on financial ties, 27% had financial ties publicly disclosed in scholarly journals. Conclusions/Significance Because science journalists often did not report conflict of interest information, adherence to gold-standard recommendations for science journalism was low. Journalists work under many different constraints, but nonetheless news reports of scientific research were incomplete, potentially eroding public trust in science."

https://openalex.org/W2005863545,"Vitamin A deficiency is associated with carcinogenesis, and upregulation of CYP26A1, a major retinoic acid (RA)-catabolizing enzyme, has recently been shown in cancer. We have previously demonstrated alterations of RA biosynthesis in Barrett's oesophagus, the precursor lesion to oesophageal adenocarcinoma. The aims of this study were to determine CYP26A1 expression levels and functional effects in Barrett's associated carcinogenesis. Retinoic acid response element reporter cells were used to determine RA levels in non-dysplastic and dysplastic Barrett's cell lines and endoscopic biopsies. CYP26A1 expression levels, with or without induction by RA and lithocholic acid, were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. CYP26A1 promoter activity was determined by a luciferase reporter construct. CYP26A1 was stably overexpressed in GihTERT cells, which were evaluated for gene-expression changes (pathway array and quantitative RT-PCR), cellular proliferation (cytometric DNA profile and colorimetric assay) and invasion (in vitro matrigel assay) with or without the CYP inhibitor ketaconazole. RA levels decreased progressively with the degree of dysplasia (P<0.05) and were inversely correlated with CYP26A1 gene levels and activity (P<0.01). CYP26A1 expression was increased synergistically by RA and lithocholic acid (P<0.05). Overexpression of CYP26A1 led to induction of c-Myc, epidermal growth factor receptor and matrix metalloproteinase 3 as well as downregulation of tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1 and 3. Functional effects of CYP26A1 overexpression were increased proliferation (P<0.01) and invasion in vitro (P<0.01), which were inhibited by ketaconazole. Overexpression of CYP26A1 causes intracellular RA depletion and drives the cell into a highly proliferative and invasive state with induction of other known oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2083297717,"Media depictions of violence, although often claimed to induce viewer aggression, have not been shown to affect the cortical networks that regulate behavior.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we found that repeated exposure to violent media, but not to other equally arousing media, led to both diminished response in right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (right ltOFC) and a decrease in right ltOFC-amygdala interaction. Reduced function in this network has been previously associated with decreased control over a variety of behaviors, including reactive aggression. Indeed, we found reduced right ltOFC responses to be characteristic of those subjects that reported greater tendencies toward reactive aggression. Furthermore, the violence-induced reduction in right ltOFC response coincided with increased throughput to behavior planning regions.These novel findings establish that even short-term exposure to violent media can result in diminished responsiveness of a network associated with behaviors such as reactive aggression."
https://openalex.org/W2035416209,"Estrogens are required for the proliferation of hormone dependent breast cancer cells, making estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors amenable to endocrine therapies such as antiestrogens. However, resistance to these agents remains a significant cause of treatment failure. We previously demonstrated that inactivation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb) family tumor suppressors causes antiestrogen resistance in MCF-7 cells, a widely studied model of estrogen responsive human breast cancers. In this study, we investigate the mechanism by which pRb inactivation leads to antiestrogen resistance. Cdk4 and cdk2 are two key cell cycle regulators that can phosphorylate and inactivate pRb, therefore we tested whether these kinases are required in cells lacking pRb function. pRb family members were inactivated in MCF-7 cells by expressing polyomavirus large tumor antigen (PyLT), and cdk activity was inhibited using the cdk inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p21(Waf1/Cip1). Cdk4 activity was no longer required in cells lacking functional pRb, while cdk2 activity was required for proliferation in both the presence and absence of pRb function. Using inducible PyLT cell lines, we further demonstrated that pRb inactivation leads to increased cyclin A expression, cdk2 activation and proliferation in antiestrogen arrested cells. These results demonstrate that antiestrogens do not inhibit cdk2 activity or proliferation of MCF-7 cells in the absence of pRb family function, and suggest that antiestrogen resistant breast cancer cells resulting from pRb pathway inactivation would be susceptible to therapies that target cdk2."
https://openalex.org/W2063508158,"Background The interactions of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (VGCC) with syntaxin 1A (Sx 1A), Synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kD (SNAP-25), and synaptotagmin, couple electrical excitation to evoked secretion. Two vicinal Cys residues, Cys 271 and Cys 272 in the Sx 1A transmembrane domain, are highly conserved and participate in modulating channel kinetics. Each of the Sx1A Cys mutants, differently modify the kinetics of Cav1.2, and neuronal Cav2.2 calcium channel. Methodology/Principle Findings We examined the effects of various Sx1A Cys mutants and the syntaxin isoforms 2, 3, and 4 each of which lack vicinal Cys residues, on evoked secretion, monitoring capacitance transients in a functional release assay. Membrane capacitance in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing Cav1.2, Sx1A, SNAP-25 and synaptotagmin, which is Bot C- and Bot A-sensitive, was elicited by a double 500 ms depolarizing pulse to 0 mV. The evoked-release was obliterated when a single Cys Sx1A mutant or either one of the Sx isoforms were substituted for Sx 1A, demonstrating the essential role of vicinal Cys residues in the depolarization mediated process. Protein expression and confocal imaging established the level of the mutated proteins in the cell and their targeting to the plasma membrane. Conclusions/Significance We propose a model whereby the two adjacent transmembranal Cys residues of Sx 1A, lash two calcium channels. Consistent with the necessity of a minimal fusion complex termed the excitosome, each Sx1A is in a complex with SNAP-25, Syt1, and the Ca2+ channel. A Hill coefficient >2 imply that at least three excitosome complexes are required for generating a secreting hetero-oligomer protein complex. This working model suggests that a fusion pore that opens during membrane depolarization could be lined by alternating transmembrane segments of Sx1A and VGCC. The functional coupling of distinct amino acids of Sx 1A with VGCC appears to be essential for depolarization-evoked secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2092369704,"The hypothesis of independence between the failure time and the cause of failure is studied by using the conditional probabilities of failure due to a specific cause given that there is no failure up to certain fixed time. In practice, there are situations when the failure times are available for all units but the causes of failures might be missing for some units. We propose tests based on U-statistics to test for independence of the failure time and the cause of failure in the competing risks model when all the causes of failure cannot be observed. The asymptotic distribution is normal in each case. Simulation studies look at power comparisons for the proposed tests for two families of distributions. The one-sided and the two-sided tests based on Kendall type statistic perform exceedingly well in detecting departures from independence."
https://openalex.org/W2111109572,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common form of motor neuron disease (MND). It is currently incurable and treatment is largely limited to supportive care. Family history is associated with an increased risk of ALS, and many Mendelian causes have been discovered. However, most forms of the disease are not obviously familial. Recent advances in human genetics have enabled genome-wide analyses of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that make it possible to study complex genetic contributions to human disease. Genome-wide SNP analyses require a large sample size and thus depend upon collaborative efforts to collect and manage the biological samples and corresponding data. Public availability of biological samples (such as DNA), phenotypic and genotypic data further enhances research endeavors. Here we discuss a large collaboration among academic investigators, government, and non-government organizations which has created a public repository of human DNA, immortalized cell lines, and clinical data to further gene discovery in ALS. This resource currently maintains samples and associated phenotypic data from 2332 MND subjects and 4692 controls. This resource should facilitate genetic discoveries which we anticipate will ultimately provide a better understanding of the biological mechanisms of neurodegeneration in ALS."
https://openalex.org/W3211403660,"Faced with the recurrent evolution of resistance to pesticides and drugs, the scientific community has developed theoretical models aimed at identifying the main factors of this evolution and predicting the efficiency of resistance management strategies. The evolutionary forces considered by these models are generally similar for viruses, bacteria, fungi, plants or arthropods facing drugs or pesticides, so interaction between scientists working on different biological organisms would be expected. We tested this by analysing co-authorship and co-citation networks using a database of 187 articles published from 1977 to 2006 concerning models of resistance evolution to all major classes of pesticides and drugs. These analyses identified two main groups. One group, led by ecologists or agronomists, is interested in agricultural crop or stock pests and diseases. It mainly uses a population genetics approach to model the evolution of resistance to insecticidal proteins, insecticides, herbicides, antihelminthic drugs and miticides. By contrast, the other group, led by medical scientists, is interested in human parasites and mostly uses epidemiological models to study the evolution of resistance to antibiotic and antiviral drugs. Our analyses suggested that there is also a small scientific group focusing on resistance to antimalaria drugs, and which is only poorly connected with the two larger groups. The analysis of cited references indicates that each of the two large communities publishes its research in a different set of literature and has its own keystone references: citations with a large impact in one group are almost never cited by the other. We fear the lack of exchange between the two communities might slow progress concerning resistance evolution which is currently a major issue for society."
https://openalex.org/W2047752964,"Different evolutionary hypotheses predict a correlation between the fitness of a genotype in the absence of infection and the likelihood to become infected. The cost of resistance hypothesis predicts that resistant genotypes pay a cost of being resistant and are less fit in the absence of parasites. The inbreeding-infection hypothesis predicts that the susceptible individuals are less fit due to inbreeding depression.Here we tested if a host's natural infection status was associated with its fitness. First, we experimentally confirmed that cured but formerly infected Daphnia magna are genetically more susceptible to reinfections with Octosporea bayeri than naturally uninfected D. magna. We then collected from each of 22 populations both uninfected and infected D. magna genotypes. All were treated against parasites and kept in their asexual phase. We estimated their relative fitness in an experiment against a tester genotype and in another experiment in direct competition. Consistently, we found no difference in competitive abilities between uninfected and cured but formerly infected genotypes. This was the case both in the presence as well as in the absence of sympatric parasites during the competition trials.Our data do not support the inbreeding-infection hypothesis. They also do not support a cost of resistance, however ignoring other parasite strains or parasite species. We suggest as a possible explanation for our results that resistance genes might segregate largely independently of other fitness associated genes in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2038287873,"Background The high-throughput genotyping chips have contributed greatly to genome-wide association (GWA) studies to identify novel disease susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The high-density chips are designed using two different SNP selection approaches, the direct gene-centric approach, and the indirect quasi-random SNPs or linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based tagSNPs approaches. Although all these approaches can provide high genome coverage and ascertain variants in genes, it is not clear to which extent these approaches could capture the common genic variants. It is also important to characterize and compare the differences between these approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings In our study, by using both the Phase II HapMap data and the disease variants extracted from OMIM, a gene-centric evaluation was first performed to evaluate the ability of the approaches in capturing the disease variants in Caucasian population. Then the distribution patterns of SNPs were also characterized in genic regions, evolutionarily conserved introns and nongenic regions, ontologies and pathways. The results show that, no mater which SNP selection approach is used, the current high-density SNP chips provide very high coverage in genic regions and can capture most of known common disease variants under HapMap frame. The results also show that the differences between the direct and the indirect approaches are relatively small. Both have similar SNP distribution patterns in these gene-centric characteristics. Conclusions/Significance This study suggests that the indirect approaches not only have the advantage of high coverage but also are useful for studies focusing on various functional SNPs either in genes or in the conserved regions that the direct approach supports. The study and the annotation of characteristics will be helpful for designing and analyzing GWA studies that aim to identify genetic risk factors involved in common diseases, especially variants in genes and conserved regions."
https://openalex.org/W2056962647,"Background The timing at which sensory input reaches the level of conscious perception is an intriguing question still awaiting an answer. It is often assumed that both visual and auditory percepts have a modality specific processing delay and their difference determines perceptual temporal offset. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we show that the perception of audiovisual simultaneity can change flexibly and fluctuates over a short period of time while subjects observe a constant stimulus. We investigated the mechanisms underlying the spontaneous alternations in this audiovisual illusion and found that attention plays a crucial role. When attention was distracted from the stimulus, the perceptual transitions disappeared. When attention was directed to a visual event, the perceived timing of an auditory event was attracted towards that event. Conclusions/Significance This multistable display illustrates how flexible perceived timing can be, and at the same time offers a paradigm to dissociate perceptual from stimulus-driven factors in crossmodal feature binding. Our findings suggest that the perception of crossmodal synchrony depends on perceptual binding of audiovisual stimuli as a common event."
https://openalex.org/W2041638013,"Bovine liver expresses six pyruvate carboxylase (PC) transcript variants, bPC5'A, bPC5'B, bPC5'C, bPC5'D, bPC5'E, and bPC5'F, which only differ at the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and contain a common coding region. The objective of this experiment was to determine the profile and abundance of PC transcripts in bovine liver at calving.A ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) protocol was developed to simplify analysis of these variants and investigate the changes in abundance of each 5' UTR transcript relative to total PC mRNA. Liver biopsy samples collected from seven cows on +1 d relative to calving were analyzed by RPA to determine the profile in PC 5' UTR variants. Results show that all six bovine PC 5' UTR variants are detected at calving. Data indicate that bovine PC 5' UTR variant A is the most abundant, variants C and E are least abundant and expression of variants B, D and F is intermediate at calving.This manuscript describes a simplified RPA method that quantifies the abundance of six PC transcripts by using two riboprobes. The lack of uniformity in the pattern of PC 5' UTR variants at calving suggests an additional complexity for control of bovine PC mRNA expression at calving that may be the result of transcriptional controls, variation in mRNA processing, or a combination of these processes."
