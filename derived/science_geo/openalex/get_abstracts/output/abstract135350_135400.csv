Using the SELEX process (systematic evolution of ligands byexponential enrichment), we have isolated 2′-F-pyrimidine RNA oligonucleotide ligands (aptamers) to human VEGF165. Representative aptamers from three distinct sequence families were truncated to the minimal sequence capable of high affinity binding to VEGF (23–29 nucleotides) and were further modified by replacement of 2′-O-methyl for 2′-OH at all ribopurine positions where the substitution was tolerated. Equilibrium dissociation constants for the interaction of VEGF with the truncated, 2′-O-methyl-modified aptamers range between 49 and 130 pm. These aptamers bind equally well to murine VEGF164, do not bind to VEGF121 or the smaller isoform of placenta growth factor (PlGF129), and show reduced, but significant affinity for the VEGF165/PlGF129 heterodimer. Cysteine 137 in the exon 7-encoded domain of VEGF165 forms a photo-inducible cross-link to a single uridine residue in each of the three aptamers. The aptamers potently inhibit the binding of VEGF to the human VEGF receptors, KDR and Flt-1, expressed by transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, one of the aptamers is able to significantly reduce intradermal VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vivo.

The growth of new blood vessels, or angiogenesis, is an essential physiological response to increased demand for nutrients and the accumulation of metabolic end products. In normal physiological processes such as wound healing and the formation of corpus luteum and endometrium, angiogenesis is tightly regulated by positive and negative signals. In several disease states, however, overactive angiogenesis contributes to advancement of disease (1Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7153) Google Scholar, 2Risau W.

VEGF displays activity as an endothelial cell mitogen and chemoattractant in vitro (3Gospodarowicz D. Abraham J.A. Schilling J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

VEGF and its two tyrosine kinase receptors, Flt-1 and Flk-1/KDR, are essential during embryonic development for the differentiation of endothelial cell precursors and the formation of a vascular network (9Carmeliet P.

Nature. 1995; 376: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (3308) Google Scholar). VEGF is secreted as a disulfide-linked homodimer that occurs in four isoforms (121, 165, 189, and 206 amino acids) that derive from alternatively spliced forms of a common mRNA (4Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar, 13Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Winer J. Leung D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). The two larger isoforms are cell matrix-associated as a consequence of their high affinity for heparin, while the smaller isoforms are more readily diffusible (13Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Winer J. Leung D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar). VEGF165 also binds heparin, while VEGF121 does not (13Ferrara N. Houck K. Jakeman L. Winer J. Leung D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar).

There is now substantial evidence that VEGF induces angiogenesis in several pathological settings. VEGF is secreted by a wide variety of cancer cell types and promotes the growth of tumors by inducing the development of tumor-associated vasculature (6Senger D.R. Galli S.J. Dvorak A.M.

Inhibition of VEGF function has been shown to limit both the growth of primary experimental tumors as well as the incidence of metastases in immunocompromised mice (19Kim K.J. Li B. Winer J. Armanini M. Gillett N. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Nature. 1993; 362: 841-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (3311) Google Scholar, 20Millauer B. Shawver L.K. Plate K.H. Risau W. Ullrich A.

Elevated VEGF expression is correlated with several forms of ocular neovascularization that often lead to severe vision loss, including diabetic retinopathy (23Adamis A.P. Miller J.W. Bernal M.-T. D'Amico D.J. Folkman J. Yeo T.-K. Yeo K.-T. Am. J. Ophthalmol. 1994; 118: 445-450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar), retinopathy of prematurity (24Pierce E.A. Avery R.L. Foley E.D. Aiello L.P. Smith L.E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 905-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), and macular degeneration (25Kvanta A. Algvere P.V. Berglin L. Seregard S. Invst. Ophthalmol. & Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1929-1934PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF may also play a role in inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (26Koch A.E. Harlow L.A. Haines G.K. Amento E.P. Unemori E.N. Wong W.L. Pope R.M. Ferrara N. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4149-4156PubMed Google Scholar) and psoriasis (27Detmar M. Brown L.F. Claffey K.P. Yeo K.T. Kocher O. Jackman R.W. Berse B. Dvorak H.F. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1141-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar). Thus, agents that specifically inhibit VEGF may have great utility in combatting a variety of human diseases for which few effective treatments are presently available. Nucleic acids, as a function of their primary structure, can fold into complex three-dimensional shapes with a great diversity of binding specificities. Using the SELEX (systematicevolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) process, oligonucleotides may be efficiently isolated from enormous randomized libraries of RNA, DNA, or modified nucleic acids that bind with high affinity and high specificity to various molecular targets (28Tuerk C. Gold L. Science. 1990; 249: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (7692) Google Scholar, 29Ellington A. Szostak J. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7279) Google Scholar). The method has been used to isolate ligands for proteins, peptides, carbohydrates, and small organic molecules (reviewed in Ref. 30Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). Such oligonucleotide ligands, termed “aptamers” (29Ellington A. Szostak J. Nature. 1990; 346: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (7279) Google Scholar), can be highly potent antagonists of enzyme catalysis or of specific protein-protein interactions (30Gold L. Polisky B. Uhlenbeck O. Yarus M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 763-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar). The potential utility of aptamers as therapeutic or diagnostic agents is considerably enhanced by chemical modifications that lend resistance to nuclease attack. In particular, substitution at the 2′-position of ribonucleotides with 2′-amino (2′-NH2), 2′-fluoro (2′-F), or a variety of 2′-O-alkyl moieties confers resistance to ribonucleases that utilize the 2′-OH group for cleavage of the adjacent phosphodiester bond (31Pieken W.A. Olsen D.B. Benseler F. Aurup H. Eckstein F. Science. 1991; 253: 314-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar, 32Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freler S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). We have previously described the use of the SELEX process to identify RNA (33Jellinek D. Green L.S. Bell C. Janjić N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10450-10456Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and 2′-NH2-pyrimidine RNA aptamers to VEGF165 (34Green L.S. Jellinek D. Bell C. Beebe L.A. Feistner B.D. Gill S.C. Jucker F.M. Janjić N. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 683-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The incentive for performing SELEX experiments with 2′-F-pyrimidine RNA libraries, described in this report, was essentially 2-fold: first, we hoped to obtain nuclease-resistant aptamers that bind to VEGF with higher affinities than the 2′-NH2-pyrimidine-based aptamers. 2′-NH2 modifications have been observed to decrease the stability of model DNA/DNA, RNA/RNA, and RNA/DNA duplexes (35Aurup H. Tuschl T. Benseler F. Ludwig J. Eckstein F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 36Miller D.S. Bhan P. Kan L.-S. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1993; 12: 785-792Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar), while substitution of 2′-F in model duplexes dramatically increases their thermal stability (32Cummins L.L. Owens S.R. Risen L.M. Lesnik E.A. Freler S.M. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Cook P.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 37Lesnik E.A. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Sasmor H. Zounes M. Cummins L.L. Ecker D.J. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7832-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 38Kawasaki A.M. Casper M.D. Freier S.M. Lesnik E.A. Zounes M.C. Cummins L.L. Gonzalez C. Cook P.D. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 831-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). If 2′-NH2 groups increase the conformational flexibility of oligonucleotides in general, the entropic cost of binding may limit the affinity of aptamers derived from 2′-NH2-pyrimidine RNA libraries (39Eaton B.E. Gold L. Zichi D.A. Chem. & Biol. 1995; 2: 633-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In contrast, 2′-F-pyrimidine aptamers may adopt more rigid conformations and, thus, may exhibit higher binding affinities for their targets. Second, apart from possible advantages related to binding affinity, the chemical synthesis of aptamers derived from 2′-F-pyrimidine libraries is considerably more economical. The coupling efficiency of 2′-F-pyrimidine phosphoramidites during oligonucleotide synthesis is greater than that of 2′-NH2-pyrimidine phosphoramidites and the 2′-F groups do not require protection/deprotection steps. Here we report that VEGF aptamers isolated from 2′-F-pyrimidine RNA libraries generally display higher affinities for VEGF than do the 2′-NH2-pyrimidine RNA aptamers isolated previously (34Green L.S. Jellinek D. Bell C. Beebe L.A. Feistner B.D. Gill S.C. Jucker F.M. Janjić N. Chem. Biol. 1995; 2: 683-695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For three representative aptamers, the minimal sequence required for high affinity binding to VEGF is encoded in 23–29 nucleotides and all but two of the 2′-OH-purine positions can be substituted with 2′-O-methyl- (2′-OMe-) purines with only modest decreases in binding affinity. The minimal, substituted aptamers bind specifically to VEGF165 with affinities between 49 and 130 pm and show no detectable binding affinity for VEGF121 or the shorter isoform of placenta growth factor (PlGF129), a protein with 53% homology to VEGF (40Maglione D. Guerriero V. Viglietto G. Delli-Bovi P. Persico M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9267-9271Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The aptamers bind to the heterodimers of VEGF165 and PlGF123, but with reduced affinities. A site of photo-cross-linking between each of the aptamers and VEGF165 was mapped to Cys137 in the carboxyl-terminal exon-7-encoded domain. In vitro, the 2′-F-pyrimidine-, 2′-OMe-purine-substituted VEGF aptamers inhibit the binding of VEGF165 to both the human Flt-1 and KDR VEGF receptors expressed on porcine aortic endothelial cells. Furthermore, one of the aptamers blocks VEGF induction of vascular permeability as measured in the Miles assay (7Senger D.R. Perruzzi C.A. Feder J. Dvorak H.F. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 5629-5632PubMed Google Scholar), and thus shows potential utility as an inhibitor of VEGF-mediated effects in vivo. Recombinant human VEGF165 purified from the insect cell line Sf21 was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) as a carrier-free lyophilized powder. The protein was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to a concentration of 10 μm and stored at −20 °C in small aliquots until use. Aliquots were stored at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks after thawing. Sf21-expressed mouse VEGF164, and Escherichia coli-expressed human VEGF121, VEGF165/PlGF129 heterodimer, and PlGF129 were also purchased from R & D Systems as carrier-free, lyophilized preparations. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA), or were synthesized in our laboratories using an Applied Biosystems Model 394 oligonucleotide synthesizer according to optimized protocols. The covalent coupling of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to aptamers was accomplished by synthesis of an oligonucleotide bearing a primary amine at the 5′-end using a trifluoroacetyl-protected pentylamine phosphoramidite, followed by reaction with 40-kDa PEGN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Shearwater Polymers, Huntsville, AL). 2′-F- and 2′-OMe-ribonucleotide phosphoramidites were prepared by JBL Scientific, Inc. (San Luis Obispo, CA) for NeXstar Pharmaceuticals. 2′-F-pyrimidine nucleotriphosphates were also purchased from JBL. 2′-OH-purine nucleotriphosphates and deoxynucleotriphosphates were from Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). [α-32P]ATP and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from NEN Life Science Products (Boston, MA). DNA oligonucleotide template libraries (5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGACGATGCGG(N30 or 40)CAGACGACTCGCCCGA-3′, where N = any nucleotide) were prepared by chemical synthesis (“30N7” and “40N7”). Italicized nucleotides at the 5′-end of each template correspond to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. Oligonucleotide primers (5′-TCGGGCGAGTCGTCTG-3′ (“3N7”) and 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGACGATGCGG-3′ (“5N7”)) were also synthesized for use in template amplification and reverse transcription. Double-stranded DNA templates were prepared by annealing primer 3N7 to the 30N7 or 40N7 libraries and extending the primer using Klenow DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 37 °C or avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Life Sciences, Inc., St. Petersburg, FL) at 45 °C. We reasoned that the higher temperature of incubation used for the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase reaction would facilitate complete extension through highly structured template oligonucleotides. 1 nmol of each library was transcribed using T7 RNA polymerase (Enzyco, Inc., Denver, CO) in the presence of 1 mm each of 2′-OH-(ATP and GTP), 3 mm each of 2′-F-(CTP and UTP), and 50 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. RNAs were purified from denaturing (7m urea) polyacrylamide gels by excising and crushing the gel slice containing the RNA and soaking it for several hours or overnight in 2 mm EDTA. Approximately 5 nmol of RNA were obtained from each transcription. The SELEX process of affinity selection followed by amplification of the selected pool has been described in detail (41Fitzwater T. Polisky B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 275-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In brief, one round of selection and amplification was performed as follows: VEGF was mixed with a 5- or 10-fold excess of 32P-radiolabeled RNA in PBS with 1 mm MgCl2 (PBSM) (30N7 and 40N7 libraries) or in Tris-buffered saline, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBSMC) (30N7 library only). After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the mixtures were passed through 0.45-μm Type HA nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to collect complexes of VEGF with RNA. The fraction of input RNA bound was monitored by measuring the radioactivity bound to the filter. RNAs were eluted from the filters by incubation in a 2:1 mixture of phenol (pH 7), 7 m urea. After precipitation from the aqueous phase, RNAs were annealed to primer 3N7 and reverse transcribed using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The resultant cDNAs were amplified with 15 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction using the 3N7 and 5N7 primers and Taq DNA polymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Transcription of the polymerase chain reaction product yielded a new library enriched for sequences with affinity for VEGF. At round 4, the binding of the RNA libraries to nitrocellulose filters without added VEGF substantially increased in all three selected RNA pools. To deplete the pools of filter-binding RNAs, rounds 5 and 6 were performed with an alternative scheme for partitioning VEGF-bound RNAs from unbound molecules: after incubation of the 32P-radiolabeled RNA pool with VEGF, each mixture was applied to an 8% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel and run at 10 W for 45–60 min at 4 °C. VEGF-RNA complexes migrated above the unbound RNA in this system and were visualized by autoradiography. For these rounds, selected RNAs were purified by the crush and soak method, as described above. The concentrations of RNA and protein were decreased in concert (from approximately 10−7m in the first selection to approximately 10−12m in the last round) as the affinity of the enriched pool for VEGF improved. After 12 rounds of selection and amplification, individual molecules in the selected pools were cloned using the pCR-Script Direct Cloning kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Plasmids were purified using the alkaline lysis method (PERFECTprep Plasmid DNA kit, 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and sequences of the cloned regions were obtained using the Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit available from Perkin-Elmer. Fluorescent sequencing ladders were read in the laboratory of Dr. Brian Kotzin, National Jewish Hospital, Denver, CO. Sequences were grouped into families and aligned by eye and with the aid of software designed at NeXstar Pharmaceuticals. 2B. Zichi, unpublished data. Aptamers radiolabeled during transcription by incorporation of α-32P-labeled nucleotriphosphates, or after synthesis using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs), were incubated in low concentration (typically less than 70 pm) with varying concentrations of VEGF or other proteins at 37 °C for 15–20 min. Incubations were in TBS, PBS, or HEPES-buffered saline (HBS), pH 7.4, with or without divalent cations. Samples were passed through prewashed 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters followed by a 5–10-ml wash with binding buffer. Filters were immersed in scintillant and the radioactivity counted to quantitate the fraction of RNA bound at each protein concentration. The binding of individual aptamers was often biphasic in nature, consistent with a model in which two species that do not interconvert on the time scale of the experiment bind to a single site on VEGF with different affinities. Equations that describe the fraction of RNA bound as a function ofKd and the total concentrations of RNA and protein (both measurable quantities) have been described for both monophasic and biphasic binding behavior (42Green L.S. Jellinek D. Jenison R. Östman A. Heldin C.-H. Janjić N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14413-14424Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Because the concentrations of RNA used in these experiments were near the Kd values of the aptamers and were too low to determine accurately, the least squares fitting of the data points to the binding equations was performed with the RNA concentration set to a negligibly low value. In making this assumption, we ensured that the binding affinities reported here are, at worst, underestimates of the actual values. Ten pmol of internally radiolabeled transcripts of high affinity VEGF aptamers were partially digested with S7 nuclease (Boehringer Mannheim) to generate a mixture of radiolabeled fragments. One-tenth of the fragmented RNA was incubated with 10 pm VEGF in 45 ml of binding buffer, prior to filtration through nitrocellulose. Selected fragments recovered from the filter were run out on a high resolution denaturing polyacrylamide gel next to a lane loaded with the unselected fragment pool. The smallest selected bands were individually purified from the gel and further labeled at their 5′-ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase to increase their specific activity. One-half of the sample was annealed to a cDNA of the original transcript and extended to the end of the template using Sequenase DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH). Comparison of the migration of the purified fragment and its extension product to a standard sequencing ladder was used to determine the probable size and position of the selected fragment within the original transcript. Synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding in sequence to the affinity selected fragments were prepared to verify that the truncated aptamer retained affinity for VEGF. 2′-F-pyrimidine oligonucleotides corresponding to truncated VEGF aptamer sequences were chemically synthesized using a 1:2 mixture of 2′-OMe-purine:2′-OH-purine phosphoramidites at five or six purine positions. Because 2′-OMe-nucleoside phosphoramidites couple with higher efficiency, the actual ratio of 2′-OMe-purine to 2′-OH-purine incorporated at each substituted position was roughly 3:1. The sequences of the oligonucleotides are shown below, with the substituted purine positions underlined. U and C represent 2′-F-uridine and 2′-F-cytidine, unless otherwise indicated. All oligonucleotides were synthesized using commercial sources of controlled pore glass beads, and thus, bear an additional 2′-OH-nucleotide at their 3′-ends. The sequences are as follows: t22.29-OMe1,GACGAUGCGGUAGGAAGAAUUGGAAGCGC(U-2′OH); t22.29-OMe2, GACGAUGCGGUAGGAAGAAUUGGAAGCGC(U-2′-OH); t22.29-OMe3, GACGAUGCGGUAGGAAGAAUUGGAAGCGC(U-2′OH); t22.29-OMe4, GACGAUGCGGUAGGAAGAAUUGGAAGCGC(U-2′OH); t2.31-OMe1,GGCGAACCGAUGGAAUUUUUGGACGCUCGCC(U-2′OH); t2.31-OMe2, GGCGAACCGAUGGAAUUUUUGGACGCUCGCC(U-2′OH); t2.31-OMe3, GGCGAACCGAUGGAAUUUUUGGACGCUCGCC(U-2′OH); t44.29-OMe1, GCGGAAUCAGUGAAUGCUUAUACAUCCGC(U-2′OH); t44.29-OMe2, GCGGAAUCAGUGAAUGCUUAUACAUCCGC(U-2′OH); t44.29-OMe3,GCGGAAUCAGUGAAUGCUUAUACAUCCGC(U-2′OH). Each oligonucleotide was radiolabeled at the 5′-end and incubated with VEGF at 320, 60, and 20 pm concentration. The mixtures were filtered through nitrocellulose and bound RNAs were collected by incubation of the filter in 2:1 phenol, pH 7, 7 m urea. Selected RNAs were collected from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation. The selected RNAs, along with aliquots of each unselected, radiolabeled oligonucleotide, were subjected to partial alkaline hydrolysis by incubation at 90 °C in 50 mmsodium carbonate buffer, pH 9, for 11 min. Hydrolyzed samples were applied to a 20% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel. Radioactive bands were visualized using a Fuji Fujix BAS 1000 PhosphorImager and the intensity of bands corresponding to hydrolysis at individual purine positions was quantitated using MacBAS software, version 2.0. Band intensities were normalized to the total intensity in the lane to correct for variability in sample loading. Band intensity ratios were determined for each purine position by dividing the normalized band intensity in the affinity selected sample by the normalized band intensity at the same position in the unselected sample. Values for the two or three oligonucleotides where a particular purine was not substituted were averaged to obtain a baseline band intensity ratio. Band intensity ratios for substituted positions that fell well below or above the baseline value provided a qualitative indication of positions that show bias for or against 2′-OMe substitution. Approximately 10 μg of aptamer were diluted in 2.5 ml of degassed buffer. Absorbance at 260 nm was monitored in a Varian Cary spectrophotometer relative to a buffer reference as the temperature of the sample was raised from 10 or 20 °C to 90 or 95 °C at a rate of 1°/min. Tmvalues were determined by fitting the data to a mathematical model (43Petersheim M. Turner D.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 256-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar) in which each aptamer is assumed to occupy one of two states (folded or unfolded). The baseline absorbance of the folded and unfolded states is assumed to be linear with changes in temperature. Six parameters describe the mathematical model, including the slope and intercept of the upper and lower linear baselines and values for the ΔHand ΔS of the folded to unfolded transition. The temperature at which ΔG = 0 (Tm) was calculated from the fitted values for ΔH and ΔS. Tm values for aptamers t22.23, t22-OMe, t2.29, and t2-OMe were determined in PBS. For t44.27 and t44-OMe, HBS with 1 mm EGTA was used for an initial determination; after cooling, CaCl2 or MgCl2was added to 2 mm final concentration and theTm was measured again. A small amount (typically less than 1 pmol) of 5′-radiolabeled aptamers were incubated with 1 nm VEGF at 37 °C in 1 ml of buffered saline supplemented with divalent cations. At time 0, 50 μl were filtered through nitrocellulose to determine the fraction of RNA bound to protein, then an excess (100 or 500 nm final concentration) of unla"

However, the transporter has not been molecularly identified. In this study, we screened a human kidney cDNA library and assembled a cDNA-encoding OCTN2 as a homologue of the organic cation transporter OCTN1, and then we examined the function of OCTN2 as a carnitine transporter. OCTN2-cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 557 amino acids with 75.8% similarity to OCTN1. Northern blot analysis showed that OCTN2 is strongly expressed in kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta in adult humans. When OCTN2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was strongly enhanced in a sodium-dependent manner with Kmvalue of 4.34 μm, whereas typical substrates for previously known organic cation transporters, tetraethylammonium and guanidine, were not good substitutes. OCTN2-mediatedl-[3H]carnitine transport was inhibited by the d-isomer, acetyl-d,l-carnitine, and γ-butyrobetaine with high affinity and by glycinebetaine with lower affinity, whereas choline, β-hydroxybutyric acid, γ-aminobutyric acid, lysine, and taurine were not inhibitory. Because the observed tissue distribution of OCTN2 is consistent with the reported distribution of carnitine transport activity and the functional characteristics of OCTN2 coincide with those reported for plasma membrane carnitine transport, we conclude that OCTN2 is a physiologically important, high affinity sodium-carnitine cotransporter in humans.

Carnitine (3-hydroxy-4-N-trimethylaminobutyric acid) is a small, water soluble molecule that has important physiological roles, including involvement in the β-oxidation of fatty acids by facilitating the transport of long chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial inner membrane as their acylcarnitine esters and modulation of intracellular CoA homeostasis (1Bremer J.

Although many membrane-physiological studies of carnitine transport mechanisms have been reported (3, 5–7,12–16), it is essential for a clearer understanding of the primary carnitine deficiency to identify the relevant transporter and to functionally characterize the carnitine transport in detail. We have recently cloned and characterized a novel organic cation transporter OCTN1 from human fetal liver (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). OCTN1 was expressed strongly in adult tissues such as kidney, trachea, and bone marrow and weakly in other tissues. When expressed in HEK293 cells, OCTN1 caused significant transport of tetraethylammonium (TEA), 1The abbreviations used are: TEAtetraethylammonium.1The abbreviations used are: TEAtetraethylammonium. a typical organic cation, in a pH-dependent manner. These characteristics strongly suggested that OCTN1 acts as a proton/organic cation antiporter at the renal epithelial apical membrane (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 18Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). In the present study, we identified a new transporter molecule, OCTN2, with high homology to OCTN1. We cloned full-length cDNA for this putative member of the organic cation transporter family, expressed it in HEK293 cells, and showed that OCTN2 has the characteristics of a high affinity sodium/carnitine cotransporter. tetraethylammonium. tetraethylammonium. l-[Methyl-3H]carnitine hydrochloride (85 Ci/mmol) and [14C]guanidine (56 mCi/mmol), [1-14C]-tetraethylammonium bromide (2.4 mCi/mmol), and [α-32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Rockinghamshire, UK), Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA), and New England Nuclear (Boston, MA), respectively. pcDNA3 was obtained from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Multiple tissue Northern blots were purchased from CLONTECH. All other enzymes and reagents were obtained from Takara (Otsu, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Osaka, Japan), and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). HEK293 cells were obtained from Japanese Cancer Research Resources Bank (Tokyo, Japan). A data base search for matches to the cDNA sequence of the OCTN1 gene revealed several genomic cosmid clones (GenBankTM accession numbers L43407, L43408, L46907, L81773, and L43409), derived from human chromosome 5q, that contain sequences highly homologous to OCTN1. Because these genomic sequences do not cover the entire open reading frame for this new gene, which we designated OCTN2 on the basis of its high similarity to OCTN1, we initiated cDNA cloning. From the genomic sequence, two primers (631RT S4 5′-GTGCTGTTGGGCTCCTTCATTTCA-3′ and 631RT A1 5′-AGCTGCATGAAGAGAAGGACACTG-3′) were prepared and used in reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of human kidney-derived cDNA. This afforded a 900-base pair 32 cDNA fragment of OCTN2. Screening of a human kidney cDNA library with this fragment as the probe yielded overlapping, longer clones that provided additional sequences. A primer (631R S6 5′-AGCATCCTGTCTCCCTACTTCGTT-3′) designed from the new sequence was used to amplify the 3′ portion of OCTN2 by 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends using human kidney Marathon-ReadyTM cDNA (CLONTECH). Finally, the full coding sequence of OCTN2 was obtained by assembling these sequences. To assess OCTN2 expression in human tissues, an OCTN2 cDNA fragment, amplified with the 631RT S4 and 631RT A1 primers, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP and subjected to Northern blotting with poly(A)+ RNA from a wide range of normal human tissues and cancer cell lines (CLONTECH). Hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C for 1 h. Membranes were then washed in 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 60 min and finally in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min twice. The full-length OCTN2 cDNA was subcloned into the BamHI sites of the expression vector pcDNA3, and the construct, pcDNA3/OCTN2 was used to transfect HEK293 cells by means of the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). The cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in tissue culture dishes in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for 24 h and then transfected with pcDNA3 plasmid carrying full-length OCTN2 cDNA or with the pcDNA3 plasmid vector alone. At 48 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policemen and suspended in the medium for transport study, which consisted of 125 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 5.6 mmd-glucose, 1.2 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, and 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). The cell suspension and transport medium containing a radiolabeled test compound were preincubated separately for 20 min and then mixed to initiate uptake. At appropriate times, 200-μl aliquots of the mixture were withdrawn, and the cells were separated from the transport medium by centrifugation in a microtube containing a silicon oil and liquid paraffin mixture with a density of 1.03. The resultant cell pellets were solubilized in 3 n KOH and then neutralized with HCl, and the associated radioactivity was quantitated in a liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). Cellular protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. When sodium ions were replaced with other cations, the obtained cells were suspended in sodium-free medium. The composition of sodium-free medium was the same as that of the above transport medium except that the sodium chloride was replaced isotonically with potassium chloride, choline chloride,N-methylglucamine chloride, or lithium chloride. Usually initial uptake rates were obtained by measuring the uptake at 3 min. To estimate kinetic parameters for saturable transport, the uptake rate (v) was fitted to the following equation by means of nonlinear least squares regression analysis using WinNonlin (Scientific Consulting Inc., Cary, NC). v =Vmax × s/(Km +s), where v and s are the uptake rate and concentration of carnitine, respectively, and Kmand Vmax are the half-saturation concentration (Michaelis constant) and maximum transport rate, respectively. All data were expressed as the means ± S.E., and statistical analysis was performed by use of Student's t test. The criterion of significance was taken to be p < 0.05. The full-length OCTN2 cDNA appeared to encode a polypeptide of 557 amino acids and have 75.8% similarity with human OCTN1 (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Human OCTN2 is predicted to have twelve putative membrane-spanning domains by hydropathy analysis according to TopPred 2 (20Claros M.G. von Heijine G. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 685-686PubMed Google Scholar) as well as threeN-glycosylation sites and six protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. The presence of twelve membrane spanning domains agrees with that of previously known membrane transporters (21Henderson P.J.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Like human OCTN1, OCTN2 has a unique sugar transport protein signature (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequence with those of other organic ion transporters revealed that human OCTN2 has similarity with rat OCT1 (32.5%) (22Grundermann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), rat OCT2 (33.6%) (23Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Moore K.R. Han H. Yang-Feng T. Chang A.S. Ganapathy V. Blakely R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2542-2546Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar) or monoamine transporter (29Erickson J.D. Eiden L.E. Hoffman B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10993-10997Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). These data indicate that OCTN2 may be a member of the organic cation transporter family. Fig. 2 shows the tissue distribution of human OCTN2 examined by Northern blotting analysis. In fetal tissues, OCTN2 was expressed strongly in kidney and weakly in liver, lung, and brain. In adult, it was expressed strongly in kidney, skeletal muscle, placenta, heart, prostate, and thyroid and weakly in pancreas, liver, lung, brain, small intestine, uterus, thymus, adrenal gland, trachea, spinal cord, and several other tissues. Interestingly, specific bands corresponding to human OCTN2 were also detected in human tumor-derived cell lines, including melanoma G361, lung carcinoma A549, colorectal carcinoma SW480, chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, and carcinoma of cervix HeLa S3. The distribution in tumor cell lines is very similar to that of human OCTN1. On the other hand, the distributions of OCTN2 in normal fetal and adult tissues are different from those of OCTN1, especially as regards the significant expression of OCTN2 in fetal kidney and in skeletal muscle, liver, placenta, heart, prostate, and thyroid in adults, although OCTN1 and OCTN2 both exhibit broad tissue distribution. Because human OCTN1 transported the organic cation TEA in a pH-dependent manner when expressed in HEK293 cells in our previous study (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), we expressed human OCTN2 in the same cells and measured the uptake of cationic compounds for comparison with that of OCTN1. Although TEA is a good substrate of OCTN1 (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), no significant increase of [14C]TEA uptake was observed in human OCTN2-transfected cells (298 ± 60 pmol/mg protein/3 min in OCTN2-transfected HEK293 cells and 263 ± 12 in nontransfected cells at the TEA concentration of 60 μm and at 3 min). Because guanidine was suggested to be transported by a different transporter than that for TEA across the apical membrane of renal tubular epithelial cells (30Chun J.K. Zhang L. Piquette-Miller M. Lau E. Tong L.-Q. Giacomini K.M. Pharmacol. Res. 1997; 14: 936-941Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we examined the uptake of [14C]guanidine in human OCTN1- or OCTN2-expressing cells. However, neither OCTN1 (106 ± 5.6 pmol/mg protein/3 min at 10 μm guanidine) nor OCTN2 (95.1 ± 11.8 pmol/mg protein/3 min at 10 μm guanidine) exhibited increased guanidine transport activity compared with nontransfected cells (98.4 ± 5.9 pmol/mg protein/3 min at 10 μmguanidine). Zwitterionic carnitine is reabsorbed in the kidney via an active transport mechanism, although the molecular identity of the transporter remains to be established. Accordingly, we examined the transport of carnitine in the present study. Although OCTN1 showed slight but significant uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine (2.5-fold increased uptake compared with nontransfected cells), a very large uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was seen with the human OCTN2-expressing HEK293 cells, as described below. Fig. 3 A shows the time course of the uptake of l-[3H]carnitine by HEK293 cells transfected with OCTN2 or with the expression vector pcDNA3 alone, in the presence or absence of sodium ions. Uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was significantly increased by OCTN2 transfection both in the presence and absence of sodium ions in the transport medium. The uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was particularly high in OCTN2-transfected cells in the presence of sodium ions, and it appears that OCTN2 is a sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter. Because the cells transfected with expression vector alone showed a slight but significant increase ofl-[3H]carnitine uptake in the presence of sodium ions compared with that in the absence of sodium ions, HEK293 cells themselves seem to have a weak activity of sodium ion-dependent carnitine transport. This is not surprising considering that HEK293 cells were originally derived from human embryonic kidney. Because sodium ion-dependent and OCTN2-mediated uptake of carnitine increased linearly up to 5 min, initial uptake rate of carnitine was determined at 3 min to characterize the transporter in all subsequent studies. To confirm the driving force for OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport, the effect of sodium ion replacement with various cations on carnitine transport was examined. When sodium was replaced withN-methylglucamine, potassium, or choline, initial uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was almost abolished, whereas substitution with lithium resulted in retention of a weak uptake activity (Fig. 3 B). When the temperature of the transport assay was decreased to 4 °C, the initial uptake was decreased to 3.15 ± 0.50% of that at 37 °C, demonstrating a significant temperature dependence of transport with an estimated activation energy of 17.9 kcal/mol. The concentration dependence of l-carnitine transport was examined to estimate the half-saturation concentration of OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport (Fig.4 A). OCTN2-mediated transport was saturable, and an Eadie-Hofstee plot showed a single straight line (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating the presence of a single functional site on the OCTN2 protein. The half-saturation concentration and maximum transport activity estimated by nonlinear least squares regression analysis using WinNonlin (SCI, Cary, NC) were 4.34 ± 0.602 μm and 2.94 ± 0.12 nmol/mg protein/3 min, respectively. Specificity of OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport was examined in terms of the inhibitory effect on the initial uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine. As is clearly shown in Fig.4 C, structurally analogous compounds,d-carnitine, acetyl-d,l-carnitine, and γ-butyrobetaine reduced l-[3H]carnitine uptake at 5 and 50 μm. Because l-carnitine demonstrated more potent inhibition than the d-isomer at low concentration (5 μm) OCTN2 seems to have stereospecificity. Glycinebetaine less effectively reduced the uptake of l-[3H]carnitine, and others examined, including γ-aminobutyric acid, choline, β-hydroxybutyrate, lysine, and taurine, were not inhibitory. Accordingly, the structural requirement of OCTN2-mediated carnitine transport is rather strict. Carnitine is normally maintained at a steady level in the blood, suggesting its physiological importance (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 2Pons R. De Vivo D.C. J. Child Neurol. 1995; 10: 8-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although carnitine is biosynthesized in liver and brain (31Carter A.L. Abney T.O. Lapp D.F. J. Child. Neurol. 1995; 10: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), a significant amount of carnitine is also obtained from the diet via carrier-mediated transport across the intestinal epithelial cell membranes (32De Vivo D.C. Tein I. Int. Pediatr. 1990; 5: 134-141Google Scholar, 33Shaw R.D. Li B.U.K. Hamilton J.W. Shug A.L. Olsen W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245 (G348): G376PubMed Google Scholar) and is retained in the body through reabsorption in the kidney via active transport across the renal tubular epithelial cell membrane (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 7Horiuchi M. Kobayashi K. Yamaguchi S. Shimizu N. Koizumi T. Nikaido H. Hayakawa J. Kuwajima M. Saheki T. Biochim.

O'Neill B. Knahenbuhl S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated that the tissues that extensively accumulate carnitine, such as skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and epididymis, take up and/or release carnitine via specialized transport mechanisms to maintain the steady-state tissue concentration (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar). Although many of these membrane physiological studies suggested the participation of multiple sodium ion-dependent transporters with high and low affinities in carnitine movement across tissue plasma membranes (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 13Hashimoto N. Suzuki F. Tamai I. Nikaido H. Kuwajima M. Hayakawa J. Tsuji A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Stieger B. O'Neill B. Knahenbuhl S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), no such transporter has yet been identified at the molecular level. Accordingly, to achieve a better understanding of the biological and physiological roles of carnitine, as well as carnitine-related pathological states, it is essential to identify the carnitine transporter(s). We have previously cloned the human organic cation transporter OCTN1, which may participate at least partially in proton/organic cation antiport at the renal apical membranes, and characterized it by measuring the uptake of the typical organic cation TEA by OCTN1-transfected HEK293 cells (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). In the present study, we succeeded in obtaining cDNA of a second member of the human OCTN family, OCTN2, which has a high similarity to OCTN1, and found that OCTN2 has many of the characteristics of a high affinity, sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter. The idea that human OCTN2 is a sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter is supported by the specific tissue distribution and the result of functional expression in HEK293 cells. Most adult tissues that highly express OCTN2, including skeletal muscle, kidney, placenta, and heart, have been reported to take up carnitine via a sodium ion-dependent, carrier-mediated transport mechanism (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 15Stieger B. O'Neill B. Knahenbuhl S. Biochem.

As regards fetal tissues, we previously found that mouse embryo fibroblasts take up carnitine in a sodium ion-dependent manner with a half-saturation concentration of 5.5 μm, although the distribution of carnitine transport activity in fetal tissues was not established (13Hashimoto N. Suzuki F. Tamai I. Nikaido H. Kuwajima M. Hayakawa J. Tsuji A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1998; 55: 1729-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Tissues that have apparently low affinity carnitine transporters, such as liver, brain, and intestine, with apparent half-saturation concentrations between 0.2 mm and 10 mm (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 33Shaw R.D. Li B.U.K. Hamilton J.W. Shug A.L. Olsen W.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245 (G348): G376PubMed Google Scholar,37Kispal G.

Neurochem. 1981; 36: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), showed low expression of OCTN2. The distribution of OCTN2 is different from that of OCTN1, which has 75.8% sequence similarity with OCTN2 and coincides well with the functional distribution of sodium ion-dependent, high affinity carnitine transport activity as discussed above. Furthermore, OCTN2 hardly transported TEA, a good substrate of OCTN1, or guanidine, a substrate of the second renal organic cation transporter, which is distinct from that for TEA (30Chun J.K. Zhang L. Piquette-Miller M. Lau E. Tong L.-Q. Giacomini K.M. Pharmacol. Res. 1997; 14: 936-941Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), OCTN2 seems likely to have some physiological role other than the renal excretion of organic cations. When OCTN2 was expressed in HEK293 cells, a high uptake ofl-[3H]carnitine was observed in the presence of sodium ions (Fig. 3, A and B). Because the cellular volume of HEK293 cells obtained from the accumulation of3H2O is 6.3 μl/mg protein (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar),l-[3H]carnitine apparently accumulated to the extent of about 320-fold at the steady-state in the cells by utilizing an inside-directed sodium ion gradient as the driving force. Lithium ions partially retained uphill transport (Fig. 3 B) in a manner comparable with the carnitine transport obtained using rat renal brush border membrane vesicles (15Stieger B. O'Neill B. Knahenbuhl S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and human placental choriocarcinoma cells (16Prasad P.D. Huang W. Ramamoorthy S. Carter A.L. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), which suggests that lithium ions are partially accepted as the cation for cotransport with carnitine. When sodium was replaced with choline, carnitine uptake was specifically eliminated (Fig.3 B). Although 500 μm choline was not inhibitory (Fig. 4 B), choline may have a low affinity to compete with carnitine binding to OCTN2. The half-saturation concentration of l-carnitine uptake by OCTN2 was estimated to be 4.34 μm, which is very similar to the values observed for high affinity carnitine transport in membrane physiological studies in kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, placenta, and cultured fibroblasts (1Bremer J. Physiol. Rev. 1983; 63: 1420-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1381) Google Scholar, 2Pons R. De Vivo D.C. J. Child Neurol. 1995; 10: 8-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Tein I. De Vivo D.C. Bierman F.

Carnitine transport in these tissues was reported to be significantly inhibited by the d-isomer of carnitine, acetylcarnitine, and γ-butyrobetaine in a stereospecific manner (6Stanley C.A. DeLeeuw S.

Furthermore, glycinebetaine and choline were low affinity inhibitors and γ-aminobutyric acid was not inhibitory (14Rebouche C.J. Mack D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Stieger B. O'Neill B. Knahenbuhl S. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 16Prasad P.D.

Acta. 1977; 471: 145-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These previously reported substrate specificity characteristics exactly coincide with the properties of OCTN2. We conclude that OCTN2 is a high affinity, sodium ion-dependent carnitine transporter expressed in several tissues, including kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, and placenta. The amino acid sequence of human OCTN2 is very similar to that of human OCTN1, although OCTN1 exhibited only a low carnitine transport activity and had the functional characteristics of a proton/organic cation antiporter (17Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Furthermore, TEA, a good substrate for OCTN1, was not transported well by OCTN2. Such significant differences of substrate specificity and driving force for transport despite the similarity in amino acid sequence may suggest that the binding or recognition specificity for substrates and cotransported ions on the transporter proteins is determined in a very limited region and that OCTN proteins have both common structures as membrane transporters and distinct small regions for the recognition of the substrate and cotransported ions. It will be interesting to identify the essential amino acid sequence of the functional binding sites by constructing chimeric proteins of OCTN1 and OCTN2. The strong expression of OCTN2 in human-derived tumor cells is similar to that of OCTN1 (14Rebouche C.J. Mack D.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 235: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This may reflect up-regulation of expression of the gene in malignancy to meet a higher requirement forl-carnitine. In conclusion, human OCTN2 was cloned as a new member of the family of organic cation transporters. Studies of its tissue distribution and its functional expression in HEK293 cells indicated that OCTN2 is a physiologically important, high affinity carnitine transporter that shows significant sodium ion dependence. The identification of this carnitine transporter should contribute to a better understanding of the physiological and biochemical functions of carnitine, as well as to the development of measures to treat primary carnitine deficiency. In addition, isolation of the counterpart of OCTN2 in mice and comparison with juvenile visceral steatosis mice, which show abnormal carnitine metabolism and related diseases, may help to identify the principal causes of carnitine deficiency syndromes (7Horiuchi M.

https://openalex.org/W1972001482,"Various members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily interact directly with signaling molecules of the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family to activate nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK), a recently described TNF receptor family member, and its ligand, RANKL, promote survival of dendritic cells and differentiation of osteoclasts. RANK contains 383 amino acids in its intracellular domain (residues 234–616), which contain three putative TRAF-binding domains (termed I, II, and III). In this study, we set out to identify the region of RANK needed for interaction with TRAF molecules and for stimulation of NF-κB and JNK activity. We constructed epitope-tagged RANK (F-RANK616) and three C-terminal truncations, F-RANK330, F-RANK427, and F-RANK530, lacking 85, 188, and 285 amino acids, respectively. From this deletion analysis, we determined that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 interact with RANK at its C-terminal 85-amino acid tail; the binding affinity appeared to be in the order of TRAF2 > TRAF5 > TRAF6. Furthermore, overexpression of RANK stimulated JNK and NF-κB activation. When the C-terminal tail, which is necessary for TRAF binding, was deleted, the truncated RANK receptor was still capable of stimulating JNK activity but not NF-κB, suggesting that interaction with TRAFs is necessary for NF-κB activation but not necessary for activation of the JNK pathway."

One of the more prominent noncollagenous proteins is COMP. This protein was initially found in articular, nasal, and tracheal cartilage (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M.

In support, a non-weight-bearing equine tendon shows considerably lower COMP levels than the contralateral weight-bearing one (3Smith R.K. W Zunino L. Webbon P.M. Heinegård D.

COMP was first isolated from bovine articular cartilage by extraction under denaturing conditions with 4 m guanidine HCl (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M.

Native COMP has been isolated from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma (6Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bovine cartilage (7DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J.

Res. 1995; 13: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) under mild nondenaturing conditions by extraction with 10 mm EDTA, indicating that the interaction of COMP with components of the ECM depends on divalent cations. Structurally, COMP is related to the thrombospondins (9Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), having the same molecular domain arrangement of a series of four type 2 (epidermal growth factor) repeat domains followed by seven type 3 domains (calcium binding). COMP, however, is a pentameric glycoprotein consisting of identical 86650 ± 163-Da subunits, each substituted with two N-linked oligosaccarides (10Zaia J. Boynton R.E. McIntosh A. Marshak D.R.

The five monomers are joined by interactions between their N-terminal portions that form a cylindrical structure (6Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interactions involve the formation of a five-stranded coiled coil (11Efimov V.P. Lustig A. Engel J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) from an α-helical domain at the N terminus and are stabilized by two disulfide bonds. 3A. Oldberg, personal communication. 3A. Oldberg, personal communication. This structure shows a remarkable similarity to proposed models for trans-membrane ion-channels (12Malashkevich V.N. Kammerer R.A. Efimov V.P. Schulthess T. Engel J. Science. 1996; 274: 761-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), although the role for such a protein in the ECM remains an enigma. The α-helical oligomerization domain is followed by a flexible strand and, at the C-terminal, a globular domain (6Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that shows homology to the thrombospondins (9Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that the globular C termini form multimeric binding sites for the interaction with other ECM components. Bovine (9Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and human (13Newton G. Weremowicz S. Morton C.C.

Genomics. 1994; 24: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) COMP contain an RGD sequence although at different locations, indicating that COMP may mediate cell binding (7DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Rat COMP, however, does not contain any RGD sequence (9Oldberg A. Antonsson P. Lindblom K. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22346-22350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the primarily interterritorial localization of the protein in adult human cartilage2 suggests that the promotion of cell binding is not a primary function of COMP. It is possible that the adhesive properties of COMP are indirect, mediated by an ECM interaction partner. In line, no cell surface receptor for COMP has been isolated. That COMP may have important functions in the ECM is illustrated by the fact that a mutation in the potentially Ca-binding domain has been shown to lead to impaired secretion and severe multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (14Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Gaines E.S. Cekleniak J.A. Knowlton R.G. Cohn D.H. Nat.

In cartilage and tendon collagens II and I, respectively, are major components. Collagens are rodlike molecules, composed of three α-chains forming a very stable triple-helical structure. Each polypeptide chain is largely made up of a repeating sequence of -Gly-X-Y-, where X often is proline andY hydroxyproline (15Bornstein P. Traub W. Neurath H. Hill R.L. The Proteins. Academic Press, New York1979: 411-632Crossref Google Scholar). In collagens I and II, many such monomers are assembled in a very specific fashion into fibrils, which are stabilized by intra- and intermolecular cross-links (16Kühn K. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, New York1987: 1-42Crossref Google Scholar). Obviously, the organization of collagen fibrils in the ECM is of fundamental importance to the structure and function of e.g.cartilage and tendon. In the tissue the collagen fibrils associate to form fibers, which, in turn, form a network that is stabilized by cross bridging molecules. These include other collagens, e.g.collagen IX in cartilage (17van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as noncollagenous molecules such as decorin (18Vogel K.G. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem.

In this report we present new data showing that native COMP is a novel interaction partner for collagens and that the interaction requires specific divalent cations. Fresh adult bovine fetlock joint articular cartilage (120 g) obtained from the local slaughterhouse was homogenized on ice with a Polytron homogenizer in 10 volumes (ml/g) of preextraction buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing proteinase inhibitor mix: 0.10 m ε-aminocaproic acid, 5 mm benzamidine hydrochloride, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide). The homogenate was preextracted for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm (Beckman, JA 20 rotor) for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 10 volumes of the same buffer by brief homogenization, washed for 15 min at 4 °C, and centrifuged as above. COMP was extracted from the residue with 10 volumes (ml/g) of extraction buffer (preextraction buffer now containing 10 mm EDTA) overnight at 4 °C. The residue was reextracted for 15 min with 10 volumes (ml/g) of extraction buffer. Remaining proteins were extracted with 4 m guanidine HCl, 50 mm sodium acetate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 5.8, containing proteinase inhibitor mix. Aliquots of 50 μl from all extracts were analyzed for COMP by 4–16% SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The EDTA extracts containing COMP, were combined, diluted with an equal volume of 0.10 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 and applied to a 110-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) equilibrated with 70 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After washing with equilibration buffer, COMP was eluted with a 1000-ml, 70–400 mm linear NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions of 10 ml were collected, and aliquots of 50 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE to identify COMP-containing fractions. Relevant fractions were combined, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA), diluted with an equal volume of distilled water and passed over a 5-ml heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS) to remove fibronectin and thrombospondin (7DiCesare P.E. Mörgelin M. Mann K. Paulsson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 927-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The flow-through, containing COMP, was collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM10 membrane (Amicon), and transferred to 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The sample was applied to a 5 ml MonoQ column (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. After washing with equilibration buffer, COMP was eluted with a 30 ml, 0–0.5m linear NaCl gradient in the buffer. Aliquots of 3 μl from each 1-ml fraction were analyzed for COMP by SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and Western blotting (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus reagent (Pierce). Collagen II isolated from lathyritic rat chondrosarcoma tissue was kindly provided by S. Carlsén, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Lund University. Collagen I isolated after pepsin digestion from bovine skin (Vitrogen 100) was obtained from Celtrix (Santa Clara, CA). Procollagen I was isolated from calf tendon fibroblasts (27Kadler K.E. Hojima Y. Prockop D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15696-15701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications, and was a gift from Charlotte Wiberg, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Lund University. Procollagen II prepared from matrix-free cells from chick embryo sternal cartilage (28Curran S. Prockop D.J. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1482-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was a gift from Yoshio Hojima, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jefferson Institute of Molecular Medicine, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA. 96-well plates were coated (200 μl/well) overnight at room temperature with 1 μg/ml collagen I and II dissolved in 0.1m acetic acid, pH 2.5. After rinsing with 0.15m NaCl, 0.05% Tween, the wells were blocked with 200 μl of 1 mg/ml ovalbumin in TBS for 1 h at room temperature. After rinsing as above, the collagen-coated wells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 5 μg/ml COMP diluted in TBS containing divalent ions, Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ from 0.04 to 2.56 mm. To further study the effects of Ca2+ we used 0.5 mm Zn2+ and varied the Ca2+ concentrations from 0.01 to 2.56 mm. For Scatchard analysis, constant coat concentrations of 20 μg/ml collagen and 0.5 mm Zn2+ in buffers were used with increasing concentrations of COMP, from 0.03125 to 16.0 μg/ml, which corresponds to 0.07 to 37 nm, using a calculated molecular mass for COMP pentamer of 433,250 Da (10Zaia J.

Bound COMP was detected using polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine COMP (1Hedbom E. Antonsson P. Hjerpe A. Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Rosa- Pimentel E. Sommarin Y. Wendel M. Oldberg A. Heinegård D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6132-6136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by alkaline phosphate- conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as the chromogenic substrate and recording the absorbance at 405 nm. The BIAcoreTM 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Sweden) was used to characterize the interaction and determine theKd between COMP and collagen II. Pure COMP and collagen II, respectively, were immobilized at 25 °C at a flow of 5 μl/min. Briefly, a CM5 sensor chip (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with a carboxymethylated dextran surface was activated with 40 μl of a mixture of 50 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 200 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide. COMP (40 μl of 50 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium citrate, 0.15m NaCl, pH 3.2 or collagen II (40 μl of 100 μg/ml) in 10 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, were immobilized. One surface was used as blank containing no coupled protein. Remaining activated groups were blocked with 40 μl of 1 m ethanolamine in 0.1m NaHCO3, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 8.3. The immobilization resulted in 840 resonance units for COMP and 3000 resonance units for collagen II (1000 resonance units = 1 ng/mm2) (29Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbaniczky C. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The binding assay was initially optimized by varying the concentration of collagen II (0.18 to 3 μm, flow 5 μl/min, sample volume 20 μl), the flow (5–80 μl/min, concentration 0.38 μm, sample volume 40 μl) and the sample volume (50–250 μl, flow 80 μl/min, concentration 0.38 μm); in total, 15 different variables. Proteins remaining on the surface were eluted with 5 mm EDTA. In the first binding study, 12.5 μg/ml collagen II was pumped over the COMP and blank surfaces in TBS containing 1 mm ZnCl2, or 1 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 80 μl/min and a sample volume of 160 μl. In a second experiment 12.5 μg/ml COMP or, as a negative control, 10 μg/ml of ovalbumin were pumped over the collagen II and blank surfaces in TBS with 1 mmZnCl2 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min and a volume of 20 μl. The BIA evaluation software version 2.1 were used to calculate the Kd of the binding (30Fägerstam L.G. Frostell Karlsson A. Karlsson R. Persson B. Ronnberg I. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 597: 397-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). HiTrap chelating affinity columns, 1 ml, (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) were charged with Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+ according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 45 μg of COMP in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (start buffer), were applied after equilibration of the columns with the same buffer. The sample was recirculated at 16 μl/min on the column for 20 h at 15 °C. After washing with 5 ml of start buffer, bound COMP was eluted with 6 ml of 50 mm EDTA in start buffer followed by 5 ml of 7% acetic acid. Throughout the chromatographic steps, fractions of 1 ml were collected, precipitated with ethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gels were scanned, and the acquired image analyzed by Gel Pro Analyzer software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). COMP-procollagen samples (about 50 μg/ml at a molar COMP:procollagen ratio of 1:8) and COMP-collagen samples (about 200 μg/ml at a molar COMP:collagen ratio of 1:2) were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 0.2 m ammonium formate, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm ZnCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. Glycerol spraying and rotary shadowing for electron microscopy were performed as described previously (31Shotton D.M. Burke B.E. Branton D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 131: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 32Fowler W.E. Erickson H.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 134: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 33Tyler J.M. Branton D. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1980; 71: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, the samples were diluted to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml with appropriate volumes of 40% glycerol, sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica disks, driedin vacuo, and rotary shadowed with platinum/carbon by means of electron bombardment heating. Alternatively, complexes were subjected to negative staining prior to electron microscopy. Samples of the respective proteins were incubated in the dialysis buffer described above and allowed to react for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were diluted to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml with 50 mmTris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. They were adsorbed onto carbon-coated grids for 1 min, washed with one drop of water, and stained with 0.75% uranyl formate. The grids were rendered hydrophilic by glow discharge in air. Samples were observed in a Jeol 1200 EX electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Evaluation of the data from electron micrographs was done as described previously (34Engel J. Furthmayr H. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 3-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Bovine articular cartilage was sequentially extracted first with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors and N-ethylmaleimide, followed by this buffer also containing 10 mm EDTA (6Mörgelin M. Heinegård D. Engel J. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6137-6141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To estimate the size of the EDTA-extractable pool of COMP, the tissue residue was further extracted with guanidine HCl (see ”Experimental Procedures“) to release remaining proteins. Some 40% of the total amount of COMP present in the tissue was recovered in the EDTA extract (not shown) as judged by the intensity of the bands upon SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) of the different extracts. The EDTA extract was fractionated by chromatography on Fast Flow DEAE-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose, and MonoQ columns. The typical yield of native, EDTA-extracted COMP was approximately 0.2 mg/g of cartilage tissue (wet weight), and the final product appeared pure, without detectable non-COMP components as confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and Western blotting (not shown). Binding of COMP to collagens coated onto microtiter plates was demonstrated using an enzyme-linked immuosorbent assay procedure. To determine the optimal coating density, different concentrations of collagens I and II were adsorbed to the plate followed by addition of 5 μg/ml COMP in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+. The binding became saturated at a coating density of 1 μg/ml for the collagens (not shown), which was used in some of the subsequent experiments. The binding of COMP to ovalbumin, used to block unoccupied sites on the plastic surface, was negligible. In the nominal absence of divalent cations (1 mm EDTA) the binding that is seen in the presence of 1 mm Zn2+ was reduced to control levels (ovalbumin). Substitution of Zn2+ for Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ also reduced binding to control levels. Among the divalent cations tested, the interaction between COMP and collagens I and II displayed a preference for Zn2+ (Fig. 2,A and B), and the binding was saturated at 0.5 mm of Zn2+. Also Ni2+ promoted binding between COMP and these collagens, however less efficiently (70% of the binding obtained with Zn2+). To determine whether calcium ions had an inhibitory effect on the Zn2+-supported binding between COMP and collagen I and II, different concentrations of Ca2+ were combined with a constant concentration of 0.5 mm zinc. The binding was inhibited by approximately 40% at a calcium concentration of 1 mm but was not further inhibited at up to 5 times higher concentrations of calcium over zinc (Fig.3).Figure 3COMP binding to collagen I and II is affected by different ratios of Zn2+:Ca2+ in solid phase assay. Collagens I (▪——▪) and II (○——○), respectively, were coated 1 μg/ml in 0.1 m acetic acid, pH 2.5, on a 96-well polystyrene plate over night and incubated for 1 h with 5 μg/ml COMP in 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, 0.5 mm ZnCl2, pH 7.4, also containing 0.01–2.56 mm CaCl2. Bound COMP was detected using a polyclonal rabbit anti-bovine COMP followed by alkaline phosphate-conjugated swine anti-rabbit IgG usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as the chromogenic substrate and recording absorbance at 405 nm. Data are means of quadruplicate determinations ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To assess the strength of the interaction between COMP and collagens I and II the COMP concentration was varied in the presence of 0.5 mmZn2+ and a coating density of 20 μg/ml of the respective collagen. Under these conditions the binding displayed saturation at approximately 15 nm COMP both for collagen II and for collagen I (Fig. 4,A and B). Scatchard analysis (35Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17749) Google Scholar) of the data, assuming one class of binding site, demonstrated Kdvalues of 1.51 ± 0.25 nm for collagen I (Fig.4 A) and 1.72 ± 0.16 nm for collagen II (Fig. 4 B). This system was first optimized for COMP bound to the surface by adding collagen II in the presence of Zn2+. The calculated mean Kd value found for the 15 different experimental settings was 3.0 ± 1.5 nm. Further characterization of the interaction at the optimum binding conditions in the presence of Zn2+ or Ca2+ showed that no binding occurred between COMP and collagen II in the presence of Ca2+ (Fig. 5). The COMP-collagen II interaction could be demonstrated also in the reverse manner, i.e. by passing COMP over a collagen II surface in the presence of Zn2+, where ovalbumin, the negative control, did not bind (Fig. 5, inset). To determine whether COMP had direct affinity for divalent metal ions, the protein was passed over metal chelate columns charged with Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+. When applied to an uncharged column or to columns charged with Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+, COMP did not bind and was recovered in the flow-through. COMP was retained on columns charged with Zn2+, and more than 50% of the applied protein was eluted with 50 mm EDTA (Fig.6). COMP was retained also on a Ni2+ column. In this case, it did not elute with 50 mm EDTA, but elution required 7% acetic acid. Complexes between COMP and collagens were visualized by electron microscopy after spraying from glycerol/buffer mixtures and rotary shadowing (Fig. 7,A and B) as well as after adsorption to carbon films and negative staining (Fig. 7 C). Both techniques produced images where the pentameric COMP structure, with its five globular C-terminal globules, and individual 300 nm collagen monomers could be clearly distinguished. Rotary shadowing images revealed COMP-collagen I/II complexes (Fig. 7 A) and COMP-procollagen I/II complexes (Fig. 7 B), respectively. A key observation was that only the C-terminal globule of COMP interacted with the collagen monomer. This was further underlined by negative staining of COMP-collagen I/II complexes, where the N-terminal oligomerization domain of COMP appeared more distinct and clearly distinguished from collagen filaments (Fig. 7 C). By using procollagen it was possible to establish the polarity of the monomer, as the C-terminal propeptide adopted a globular conformation that was clearly visible in the micrographs (Fig. 7 B). Statistical analysis of the binding of COMP to procollagen I/II in the presence of zinc revealed four binding sites situated at 0 (the C-terminal), 126, 206, and 300 nm (the N-terminal) (Fig. 8, Aand B). The COMP molecules were roughly equally distributed between these sites, possibly with a slight preference for the C-terminal of procollagen I/II. In the presence of EDTA,i.e. in the nominal absence of Zn2+, the four sites still showed, distinguishable, although much reduced, preferential binding. However, considerable randomized binding occurred between the sites (Fig. 8, C and D), and the total number of collagen molecules containing bound COMP was reduced from 60% to 10%. The same analysis when applied to COMP-collagen I/II complexes yielded three apparent binding sites: at 0 nm, 94 nm and 126 nm (Fig. 9,A andB). This is consistent with the results obtained for procollagen, considering that it is not possible to determine the polarity of the collagen monomer. Again, substitution of Zn2+ for EDTA resulted in reduced relative binding at the specific binding sites and increased random binding (Fig. 9,C and D).Figure 8COMP distribution along procollagens I and II in the presence of zinc or EDTA. COMP was incubated with procollagen I or II during dialysis overnight in 0.2 mammonium formate, pH 7.4, with 1 mm zinc for glycerol spraying/rotary shadowing or for 2 h in the same buffer with 1 mm EDTA for negative staining. The molar ratio COMP:procollagen was 1:8. Interactions between COMP and procollagen I and II were in the presence of Zn2+ (A andB) or EDTA (C and D). The C-terminal of procollagen is at 0 nm and the N-terminal at 300 nm. The rel"

The integrin α subunit, which has aMr of 160 kDa reduced, was isolated from bovine chondrocytes by collagen type II affinity purification. The human homologue was obtained by screening a human chondrocyte library with a bovine cDNA probe. Cloning and cDNA sequence analysis of the human integrin α subunit designated α10 show that it shares the general structure of other integrin α subunits. The predicted amino acid sequence consists of a 1167-amino acid mature protein, including a signal peptide (22 amino acids), a long extracellular domain (1098 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (25 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic domain (22 amino acids). The extracellular part contains a 7-fold repeated sequence, an I-domain (199 amino acids) and three putative divalent cation-binding sites. The deduced amino acid sequence of α10 is 35% identical to the integrin subunit α2 and 37% identical to the integrin subunit α1. Northern blot analysis shows a single mRNA of 5.4 kilobases in chondrocytes. A peptide antibody against the predicted sequence of the cytoplasmic domain of α10 immunoprecipitated two proteins with masses of 125 and 160 kDa from chondrocyte lysates under reducing conditions.

The β1 subunit has been shown to associate with 10 different α subunits, α1–α9 and αv and to mediate interactions with extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens, laminins, and fibronectin.

We have also shown that α2β1 is a receptor for the cartilage matrix protein chondroadherin (42Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the present study we have isolated a novel collagen type II binding integrin, α10β1, from bovine articular chondrocytes. Cloning and sequence analysis of the human homologue is described, and expression of α10 on chondrocytes is examined. A polyclonal antiserum was generated against the α10 cytoplasmic domain peptide CKKIPEEEKREEKLE. Peptide synthesis and conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, injection of rabbits and affinity purification were performed by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden). Monoclonal antibodies against human integrin subunit β1 (P4C10), α2 (P1E6), and α3 (P1B5) (unpurified ascites fluid) were from Life Technology Inc.

Briefly, cartilage slices were digested by collagenase in Earle's balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 15–16 h at 37 °C. The tissue digest was filtered through a 100-μm nylon filter, and the isolated cells were then washed three times in Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 1The abbreviations used are: PBSphoshate-buffered salinePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionRACE (Race)rapid amplification of the cDNA end.

Collagen type II isolated from nasal cartilage by pepsin digestion (47Miller E.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4903-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the published procedure (25Holmvall K. Camper L. Johansson S. Rubin K. Kimura J.H. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A control column was produced by treating CNBr-Sepharose 4B in a similar manner but in the absence of protein. Bovine fibronectin (Sigma) was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B according to instructions from the manufacturer. After blocking, the fibronectin-Sepharose was washed three times with PBS. Human chondrocyte cell surface proteins were125I-labeled and affinity-purified on collagen type II-Sepharose according to the published procedure (25Holmvall K. Camper L. Johansson S. Rubin K. Kimura J.H. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cell lysates or affinity-purified samples were immunoprecipitated as described earlier (42Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in immunoprecipitation experiments: monoclonal antibodies against the human integrin subunits β1,α1,α2, or α3 (unpurified ascites fluid, dilution 1/100), polyclonal antibody against the rat integrin subunit β1 (purified IgG, 50–100 μg/ml), polyclonal peptide antibodies against the integrin subunits α1, α2, α3, and α10 (serum, dilution 1/100). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE and visualized by image analysis using the BioImaging Analyzer Bas2000 (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Human chondrocyte membrane proteins immunoprecipitated with polyclonal antibodies against α10 (10 μg/ml affinity-purified IgG) or β1 (100 μg/ml IgG) were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane essentially as described by Towbin et al. (48Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Biotechnology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with 3% dried milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15m NaCl, and 0.2% Tween (blocking buffer) and then incubated with the β1 antibody (20 μg/ml) in blocking buffer containing 1% dried milk. The β1 subunit was detected after incubation with a secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish by chemiluminescence using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Freshly isolated bovine chondrocytes (2500 × 106) were lysed in 6 ml of 1% Triton X-100, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, for 1 h on ice. The lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 rpm, and the pellet was discarded. Collagen type II-Sepharose (4 ml) and the fibronectin-Sepharose (2 ml) were equilibrated with at least 20 volumes of 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm MnCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4 (equilibration buffer). The entire cell lysate was passed over the fibonectin-Sepharose twice, and the flow through was then incubated with the collagen-Sepharose end over end for 3 h. The columns were washed (15 gel volumes) with the equilibration buffer containing 75 mm NaCl, and bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Affinity-purified proteins were concentrated by precipitation using the methanol/chloroform protocol (49Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3142) Google Scholar). After reduction/alkylation with dithiothreitol/iodoacetamide (50Blobel G. Dobberstein B. J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1826) Google Scholar), the precipitated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% polyacrylamide gel, and protein bands were visualized by Coomassie staining. The 160-kDa protein band was excised from the gel and prepared for in-gel digestion (51Hellman U. Kamp R.M. Choli-Papadopoulou T. Wittmann-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer-Verlag, Inc., Heidelberg, Germany1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel slice was washed extensively to remove SDS and the dye, and after complete drying, protease was forced into the gel by rehydration with a solution of modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in 0.2 mNH4HCO3 buffer. After an overnight incubation, peptides were extracted and then isolated by narrow bore reversed phase liquid chromatography on a μRPC C2/C18 stainless steel 2.1/10 column operated in a SMART System (Amersham). Several peptides were analyzed by Edman degradation in a Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystem Model 476 sequencer operated according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRNA from bovine or human chondrocytes were isolated using a QuickPrep® Micro mRNA purification kit (Pharmacia). cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 1 h using the SuperscriptTM II RNase H− Reverse Transcriptase cDNA Synthesis system (Life Technologies, Inc.) random DNA hexamers and oligo(dT) (Promega, Madison, WI). PCR reactions were performed in 50-μl reaction volumes and contained 1 × Taq polymerase buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μm of each primer, 0.025 units/μl Taqpolymerase, 1 μl of DNA template (bovine chondrocyte cDNA), and 0.1 mm each of dATP, dGTP, dCTP, and dTTP (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR samples were heated to 94 °C for 5 min in a thermocycler and then subjected to 35 cycles consisting of 30 s at 94 °C (denaturation), 30 s at 48 or 52 °C (annealing) and 3 min at 72 °C (extension). The PCR products were re-amplified using 1 μl of each product for an additional 35 cycles. Amplified DNA was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Small DNA fragments were analyzed using 4% MethaPhoreTM-agarose (FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME). The degenerate primers GAY AAY ACI GCI CAR AC (DNTAQT, forward) and TIA TIS WRT GRT GIG GYT (EPHHSI, reverse) were used in PCR to amplify the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the bovine peptide 1 (Table I). A 900 base pair PCR fragment was then amplified from bovine cDNA using an internal specific primer TCA GCC TAC ATT CAG TAT (SAYIQY, forward) corresponding to the cloned nucleotide sequence of peptide 1 together with the degenerate primer ICK RTCCCA RTG ICC IGG (PGHWDR, reverse) corresponding to the bovine peptide 2 (Table I). Mixed bases were used in positions that were 2-fold degenerate, and inosines were used in positions that were 3- or 4-fold degenerate.Table IAmino acid sequences of peptides from bovine α10-integrinPeptideAmino acid sequence1DNTAQTSAYIQYEPHHSI2GPGHWDR3AAFDGSGQR4FAMGALPD5FTASLDEWTTAAR6VDASFRPQGXLAPPeptides were isolated by in-gel digestion with trypsin and sequenced by Edman degradation. Open table in a new tab Peptides were isolated by in-gel digestion with trypsin and sequenced by Edman degradation. To obtain cDNA that encoded the 5′ end of α10, we designed the primer AAC TCG TCT TCC AGT GCC ATT CGT GGG (reverse; residues 1254–1280 in α10 cDNA) and used it for rapid amplification of the cDNA 5′ end (RACE) as described in the MarathonTMcDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH INC., Palo Alto, CA). PCR fragments were isolated and purified from agarose gels using Jet Sorb DNA extraction kit (Genomed Inc. Research Triangle Park, CA). Purified fragments were then cloned with the pCR ScriptTM Sk(+) kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Selected plasmids were purified from liquid cultures using QIAGEN plasmid midi preparation kit (QIAGEN Inc. Valencia, CA) and sequenced by ABI 373A sequencer using ABI PrismTMDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Core kit (Perkin-Elmer) together with T3, T7, and internal specific primers. The cloned 900-base pair PCR fragment corresponding to bovine α10-integrin was digoxigenin-labeled according to the DIG DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and used as a probe for screening of a human articular chondrocyte λZapII cDNA library (provided by Michael Bayliss, The Royal Veterinary Basic Sciences, London, UK) (52Charles I.G. Palmer R.M. Hickery M.S. Bayliss M.T. Chubb A.P. Hall V.S. Moss D.W. Moncada S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11419-11423Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Positive clones containing the pBluescript SK+ plasmid with the cDNA insert were rescued from the ZAP vector by in vivo excision as described in the ZAP-cDNA® synthesis kit (Stratagene). Selected plasmids were purified and sequenced as described earlier using T3, T7, and internal specific primers. Bovine chondrocyte mRNA was purified using a QuickPrep®Micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham), separated on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes, and immobilized by UV cross-linking. cDNA probes were 32P-labeled with Random Primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Filters were prehybridized for 2–4 h at 42 °C in 5× SSE (20 × SSC, 3m NaCl, 0.3 mtrisodium citrate·2H2O, pH adjusted to 7.0 with 1m HCl), 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 50 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 50% formamide and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C with the same solution containing the specific probe (0.5–1 × 106 cpm/ml). Specifically bound cDNA probes were analyzed using the phosphoimaging system (Fuji). Filters were stripped by washing in 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 80 °C before reprobing. The α10-integrin cDNA probe was isolated from the race1-containing plasmid using the restriction enzymes BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and NcoI (Boehringer Mannheim). The rat β1-integrin cDNA probe was a kind gift from Staffan Johansson, Uppsala, Sweden (25Holmvall K. Camper L. Johansson S. Rubin K. Kimura J.H. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Human cartilage from the trochlear groove, obtained during surgery, was provided by Anders Lindahl, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden. Frozen sections of cartilage tissue were fixed in acetone at −18 °C for 5 min, washed in PBS, and then treated with 2 mg/ml hyaluronidase (Sigma) in PBS, pH 5.0, for 15 min at 37 °C. After washing with PBS, sections were blocked for 15 min at room temperature in 0.1% H2O2 in PBS to remove endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were then washed in PBS, blocked with 0.5% casein and 0.05% thimerosal in PBS (blocking buffer) for 15 min at room temperature, and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the affinity-purified antibodies against the integrin subunits α9 or α10 (5 μg/ml in blocking buffer). For control, the α10 antibody was preincubated with the α10 peptide (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing in PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc; diluted 1:200 in blocking buffer) at room temperature for 60 min. Washed sections were then incubated with VECTASTAIN® ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature and washed, and the color was developed using 1 mg/ml diaminobenzidine, 0.02% H2O2 and 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. Sections were rinsed in water for 5 min followed by 75, 95, and 99.5% ethanol for 5 min each and then three times in xylene for 3 min at room temperature. Samples were mounted in Pertex (Histolab Products AB, Gothenburg, Sweden) and examined by light microscopy. Affinity purification of 125I-labeled membrane proteins from human chondrocytes on collagen type II-Sepharose followed by immunoprecipitation showed that these cells, in addition to α1β1 and α2β1, express an unidentified β1-related α subunit (Fig. 1). This integrin subunit had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 160 kDa under reducing condition and was slightly larger than the α2 integrin subunit. This finding is in agreement with a previous study from our group showing that bovine chondrocytes also express an unidentified collagen binding β1-associated α subunit of similar molecular mass (25Holmvall K. Camper L. Johansson S. Rubin K. Kimura J.H. Lundgren-Åkerlund E. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 221: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To isolate this protein, we affinity-purified collagen type II-binding proteins from bovine chondrocytes. The chondrocyte lysate was first applied to a fibronectin-Sepharose precolumn, and the flow-through was then applied to a collagen type II-Sepharose column. As shown in Fig.2, a number of proteins were eluted from the affinity columns. A protein with molecular mass of approximately 160 kDa was specifically eluted with EDTA from the collagen column but not from the fibronectin column. The molecular mass of this protein corresponded with the molecular mass of the unidentified β1-related integrin subunit (Fig. 1). The 160-kDa protein band was excised from the SDS-PAGE gel and digested with trypsin, and several of the isolated peptides were analyzed. Table I shows the amino acid sequence of six individual peptides.Figure 2Affinity purification of the α10 integrin subunit on collagen type II-Sepharose. A Triton X-100 lysate of bovine chondrocytes (2.5 × 109 cells) was applied to a fibronectin-Sepharose precolumn followed by a collagen type II-Sepharose column. The lanes show EDTA-eluted proteins from the fibronectin-Sepharose (A), flow-through from the collagen type II-Sepharose column (B), and EDTA-eluted proteins from the collagen type II-Sepharose (C). The eluted proteins were precipitated by methanol/chloroform, separated by SDS-PAGE (4–12%) under reducing conditions, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The 160-kDa protein with affinity for collagen type II is indicated with an arrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The nucleotide sequence corresponding to peptide 1 (Table I) was obtained by PCR amplification, cloning, and sequencing of bovine cDNA. From this nucleotide sequence an exact primer was designed and applied in PCR amplification with degenerate primers corresponding to peptides 2–6 (Table I). Primers corresponding to peptides 1 and 2 amplified a 900-base pair PCR fragment from bovine cDNA that was cloned, sequenced, and used for screening of a human articular chondrocyte λZapII cDNA library to obtain the human integrin α-subunit homologue. Two overlapping clones, hc1 and hc2 (Fig. 3), were isolated, subcloned, and sequenced. These clones contained 23 of the nucleotide sequence, including the 3′ end of the cDNA. A third clone (Race1; Fig. 3), which contained the 5′end of the α10 cDNA, was obtained using the RACE technique. From these three overlapping clones of α10 cDNA, 3884 nucleotides were sequenced (Fig. 4). The sequence contains a 3504-nucleotide open reading frame that is predicted to encode a 1167 amino acid mature protein. The predicted sequence included a signal peptide (22 amino acids), a long extracellular domain (1098 amino acids), a transmembrane domain (25 amino acids), and a short cytoplasmic domain (22 amino acids). Sequence analysis of the 160-kDa protein sequence showed that it was a member of the integrin α-subunit family, and the subunit was named α10.Figure 4Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequenc"
https://openalex.org/W2094222567,"Neu (c-erbB2) is a proto-oncogene product that encodes an epidermal growth factor-like receptor tyrosine kinase. Amplification of wild-type c-Neuand mutational activation of Neu (Neu T) have been implicated in oncogenic transformation of cultured fibroblasts and mammary tumorigenesis in vivo. Here, we examine the relationship between Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 protein expression in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies have suggested that caveolins may function as negative regulators of signal transduction. Our current results show that mutational activation of c-Neu down-regulates caveolin-1 protein expression, but not caveolin-2, in cultured NIH 3T3 and Rat 1 cells. Conversely, recombinant overexpression of caveolin-1 blocks Neu-mediated signal transduction in vivo. These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between c-Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 protein expression. We next analyzed a variety of caveolin-1 deletion mutants to map this caveolin-1-dependent inhibitory activity to a given region of the caveolin-1 molecule. Results from this mutational analysis show that this functional in vivo inhibitory activity is contained within caveolin-1 residues 32–95. In accordance with thesein vivo studies, a 20-amino acid peptide derived from this region (the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain) was sufficient to inhibit Neu autophosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay. To further confirm or refute the relevance of our findings in vivo, we next examined the expression levels of caveolin-1 in mammary tumors derived from c-Neu transgenic mice. Our results indicate that dramatic reduction of caveolin-1 expression occurs in mammary tumors derived from c-Neu-expressing transgenic mice and other transgenic mice expressing downstream effectors of Neu-mediated signal transduction, such as Src and Ras. Taken together, our data suggest that a novel form of reciprocal negative regulation exists between c-Neu and caveolin-1.

Conversely, recombinant overexpression of caveolin-1 blocks Neu-mediated signal transduction in vivo. These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between c-Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 protein expression. We next analyzed a variety of caveolin-1 deletion mutants to map this caveolin-1-dependent inhibitory activity to a given region of the caveolin-1 molecule. Results from this mutational analysis show that this functional in vivo inhibitory activity is contained within caveolin-1 residues 32–95. In accordance with thesein vivo studies, a 20-amino acid peptide derived from this region (the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain) was sufficient to inhibit Neu autophosphorylation in an in vitro kinase assay. To further confirm or refute the relevance of our findings in vivo, we next examined the expression levels of caveolin-1 in mammary tumors derived from c-Neu transgenic mice. Our results indicate that dramatic reduction of caveolin-1 expression occurs in mammary tumors derived from c-Neu-expressing transgenic mice and other transgenic mice expressing downstream effectors of Neu-mediated signal transduction, such as Src and Ras. Taken together, our data suggest that a novel form of reciprocal negative regulation exists between c-Neu and caveolin-1. Development of the normal breast and breast carcinogenesis involves a complex interplay among growth factors, steroids, activation of oncogenes, and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (1Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). TheNeu (c-erbB2) proto-oncogene encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor that is amplified and overexpressed in a significant proportion of human breast tumors (1Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr.

Increased amplification of the Neu oncogene directly correlates with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer patients in whom the cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes (3Gullich W.J. Love S.B.

Neu is a member of a growth factor receptor family that includes the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factorEGFRepidermal growth factor receptormAbmonoclonal antibodyCHOChinese hamster ovaryMMTVmurine mammary tumor virusMAPmitogen-activated protein kinase. receptor (EGFR),and Neu is therefore also known as HER2, for humanEGF receptor 2. The ligands for the Neu receptor are distinct from the structurally related EGFR (5Earp H.S. Dawson T.L. Li X. Yu H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar); however, the EGFR is capable of dimerizing with Neu, and this heterodimer can form when only one member of the pair binds ligand (5Earp H.S. Dawson T.L. Li X. Yu H. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 35: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Both Neu and the EGFR stimulate proliferation of breast cancer cells, and overexpression of these two proteins is roughly correlated with progression of human breast cancer (6Jardines L. Weiss M.

Oncogenic activation by Neu can occur through (i) overexpression, (ii) a point mutation within the transmembrane domain, or (iii) small deletions of the membrane-proximal region of the extracellular domain (8Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A variety of mutations within the transmembrane domain of the coding sequence of the rat Neu gene (for example, Neu T) are highly oncogenic (8Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Neu T in transgenic mice under the control of the MMTV long terminal repeat induces mammary adenocarcinomas with high frequency (9Bouchard L. Lamarre L. Trembley P.J. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1989; 57: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 10Muller W.J. Sinn E. Pattengale P.K. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1988; 54: 105-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar), and overexpression of wild-type Neu can also induce breast tumors (11Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parson T.J.

Several signaling pathways are activated by Neu, including activation of the Ras GTPase-activating protein and the tyrosine kinase c-Src. Here, we examine the relationship between Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 protein expression using a variety of in vitro, in vivo, and whole animal approaches. Taken together, our results indicate (i) that increases in Neu tyrosine kinase activity down-regulate caveolin-1 protein expression and (ii) that caveolin-1 overexpression can inhibit Neu-mediated signal transduction. These results suggest that a novel form of reciprocal negative regulation exists between c-Neu and caveolin-1. This is the first in vivo demonstration that caveolin-1 expression can functionally suppress signal transduction from a growth factor receptor to the nucleus.

A variety of other reagents were purchased commercially: fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), pre-stained protein markers (Life Technologies, Inc.), and Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). The PathDetectTM Elk-1 in vivo trans-Reporting System was from Stratagene. NIH 3T3 and Rat 1 cell lines expressing c-Neu or mutationally activated Neu were as described previously (14Siegel P.

NIH 3T3 cells expressing wild-type c-Neu or mutants of c-Neu were the generous gift of Dr. Mien-Chie Hung (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). NIH 3T3 cells expressing v-Src were the generous gift of Dr. David Shalloway (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY). CHO cells (GRC+ LR-73) were the generous gift of Dr. Jeffrey Pollard and were as described previously (16Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Anti-tubulin antibodies were the generous gift of Dr. Lester Binder (Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL) (17Caceres A. Binder L.I. Payne M.R. Bender P. Rebhun L. Steward O. J. Neurosci. 1983; 4: 394-410Crossref Google Scholar). NIH 3T3, Rat 1, and CHO cells were propagated in T-75 tissue culture flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% serum. Ceramide derivatives (C6-d-erythro,C6-d-erythro-(dihydro), and C6-d-threo) were purchased from Calbiochem and Matreya, Inc. Briefly, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence of a given ceramide derivative (40 μm each) in normal medium (i.e. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% donor calf serum). Canine caveolin-1 (full-length and deletion mutants) was subcloned into the multiple cloning site (HindIII/BamHI) of the vector pCB7 (containing the cytomegalovirus promoter and a hygroRmarker; gift of J. Casanova, Massachusetts General Hospital) for expression in CHO cells. To measure Neu-mediated signal transduction, we employed the PathDetectTM Elk trans-Reporting System. This assay employs a fusion protein that contains the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 and the transactivation domain of Elk to induce expression of a luciferase reporter driven by an artificial promoter containing five GAL4-binding sites. Phosphorylation of the transactivation domain of Elk, in turn, activates transcription of the luciferase gene from the reporter plasmid. Experiments testing a plasmid encoding only the GAL4 DNA-binding domain demonstrated that luciferase expression is specifically dependent on activation of the Elk transactivation domain (data not shown).Transient transfections were performed using calcium phosphate precipitation. Briefly, 300,000 CHO cells were seeded in six-well plates 12–24 h before the transfection. Each point was transfected with 1 μg of pSV, pSV-Neu wt, or pSV-Neu T; 1 μg of pFR-Luc; 50 ng of pFA-Elk (as described by Stratagene); and 1 μg of the indicated caveolin or empty vector. 12 h post-transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in 1% fetal bovine serum for another 24–36 h. The cells were then in lysed in 200 μl of extraction buffer, 50 μl of which was used to measure luciferase activity, as described (18Pestell R.G. Hollenberg A. Albanese C. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31090-31096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These assays were made possible through the use of a special CHO-derived cell line called GRC+ LR-73. Unlike parental CHO cells, GRC+ LR-73 cells are a non-transformed growth control revertant that has normal fibroblastic morphology, does not grow in suspension, requires high serum concentrations for growth, and undergoes synchronized growth arrest in low concentrations of serum (1–2%) without a loss of viability (16Pollard J.W. Stanners C.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 98: 571-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Also, these cells have a much higher transfection efficiency (∼10-fold) than parental CHO cells. Samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. After transfer, nitrocellulose sheets were stained with Ponceau S to visualize protein bands and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoblotting, incubation conditions were as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), except we supplemented our blocking solution with both 1% bovine serum albumin and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation). Total RNA was extracted and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN Inc.). 10 μg of total cellular RNA was denatured with formaldehyde and subjected to Northern blot analysis with 32P-labeled probes for the mouse caveolin-1 mRNA (2.4 kilobases) and the human 18 S rRNA, as a control for equal loading. A rabbit anti-peptide antibody directed against Neu C-terminal residues 1169–1186 (C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to immunoprecipitate Neu from CHO cells transiently transfected with the c-Neu cDNA. In vitrokinase assays were performed essentially as described previously (19Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates were equilibrated with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm MnCl2), and the reaction was initiated by addition of 15 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 15 min of incubation at 25 °C, the reaction was terminated by addition of 2× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer and boiling for 2 min. Phosphorylated c-Neu was detected by autoradiography using an intensifying screen. Prior to initiating the reaction, immunoprecipitates were preincubated in kinase reaction buffer with the indicated caveolin-derived peptides for 1 h at 4 °C. Peptides were dissolved in Me2SO, and 100× stock solutions were prepared. Controls omitting peptide contained an equivalent volume of Me2SO, which did not exceed 1%. Transgenic mice expressing MMTV-Neu (11Guy C.T. Webster M.A. Schaller M. Parson T.J. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10578-10582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar), MMTV-Src (20Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), MMTV-Ras, and MMTV-Myc (21Hundley J. Koester S. Troyer D. Hilsenbeck S. Barrington R. Windle J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 600-603PubMed Google Scholar) were as described previously. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained as detailed in a protocol provided by Transduction Laboratories, Inc. Briefly, after re-hydration, slides were placed face up in an incubation container, and each section was covered with a solution of 1% SDS in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 138 mm NaCl, and 27 mm KCl). After a blocking step, sections were incubated with anti-caveolin-1 IgG (1:500 dilution in blocking buffer; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 2 h at 37 °C. After rinsing with Tris-buffered saline (3 × 5 min each), sections were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution in blocking buffer; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) for 1 h at 37 °C. After rinsing, coverslips were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent, and slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Note that pretreatment of sections with 1% SDS has recently been shown to be an effective method for antigen retrieval, especially with anti-caveolin IgG (22Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). A variety of Neu constructions that were stably expressed in cultured fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 or Rat 1 cells) are shown in Fig. 1. Note that these include wild-type c-Neu, Neu T (a point mutation within the transmembrane domain), Neu T with a C-terminal deletion, and a series of N-terminal domain deletion mutants. All of these mutational changes are known to greatly increase their oncogenic potential and basal tyrosine kinase activity, as compared with wild-type c-Neu (14Siegel P. Dankort D.L. Hardy W.R. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7068-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar,15Xie Y. Li K. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2409-2413PubMed Google Scholar). However, Neu T with a C-terminal deletion lacks the ability to undergo autophosphorylation and does not form a stable complex with Shc, yet it is still more active than wild-type c-Neu. Lysates were prepared from these cell lines and subjected to immunoblot analysis with caveolin-specific antibodies. Immunoblotting with mAb 2297, a caveolin-1-specific mAb probe, revealed that caveolin-1 protein expression was down-regulated in all the mutants of Neu. However, overexpression of wild-type c-Neu did not affect the levels of caveolin-1 in Rat 1 cells and only moderately reduced caveolin-1 levels in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.2, A and B, upper panels). In striking contrast, immunoblotting with mAb 65, a caveolin-2-specific mAb probe, revealed that caveolin-2 levels remained relatively constant in all these cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B, lower panels). These results suggest that caveolin-1 is selectively down-regulated in response to mutational activation of the c-Neu proto-oncogene. Neu activates a number of distinct signaling cascades, including the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. Thus, we tested the effects of a well characterized MEK1/2 inhibitor (PD 98059) on caveolin-1 protein expression in NIH 3T3 cells transformed with Neu T. Fig. 2 Cshows that treatment with PD 98059 increased caveolin-1 levels by ∼2–3-fold, but caveolin-1 levels did not reach the wild-type levels observed with normal NIH 3T3 cells. This indicates that constitutive activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway contributes partially to Neu-induced caveolin-1 down-regulation. In contrast to Neu T, treatment of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells with the MEK inhibitor completely restored caveolin-1 to normal levels seen in untransformed NIH 3T3 cells (23Engelman J.A. Wycoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). What is the mechanism by which the caveolin-1 protein is down-regulated in response to Neu-mediated cell transformation? Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA revealed that the caveolin-1 mRNA was dramatically reduced in the Neu-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (Fig.2 D), in parallel with the reduction in the amount of caveolin-1 protein found in this cell line (Fig. 2 A). These studies clearly indicate that reductions in the steady-state level of caveolin-1 mRNA lead to the observed reduction in caveolin-1 protein expression. Similarly, v-Abl and activated Ha-Ras (G12V) have been shown to down-regulate both caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels in NIH 3T3 cells (24Koleske A.J. Baltimore D. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1381-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). As activation of the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade appears to contribute to the down-regulation of caveolin-1 expression (Fig. 2 C and Ref. 23Engelman J.A. Wycoff C.C. Yasuhara S. Song K.S. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), we next evaluated the effects of other stimuli that are known to activate the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade, such as v-Src and ceramide. As shown in Fig. 3 A, caveolin-1 protein expression was down-regulated in v-Src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, whereas caveolin-2 levels remained relatively constant. Similarly, treatment of normal NIH 3T3 cells with an active cell-permeable derivative of ceramide (C6-d-erythro) was sufficient to selectively down-regulate caveolin-1 expression, whereas two inactive control derivatives (C6-d-erythro-(dihydro) and C6-d-threo) did not affect caveolin-1 levels (Fig. 3 B). These results indicate that other activating stimuli that feed into the p42/44 MAP kinase cascade can down-regulate caveolin-1 protein expression. Why is caveolin-1 down-regulated in response to oncogenic Neu? One possibility is that caveolin-1 functions as a negative regulator of Neu-mediated signal transduction. To test this hypothesis of “reciprocal regulation,” we employed an assay to measure Neu-mediated signal transduction from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. In this assay, transient coexpression of Neu with a luciferase reporter plasmid allowed us to measure activation of the transcription factor Elk. This luciferase reporter plasmid contains a promoter specifically responsive to Elk phosphorylation and activation (see “Experimental Procedures”). Elk is activated in response to a wide variety of signals, including activation of p42/44 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase, and Jun kinase cascades. As expected, Neu T was ∼3.5-fold more active than wild-type c-Neu in this assay system (Fig. 4). However, coexpression of caveolin-1 dramatically inhibited Neu-mediated signal transduction evoked by overexpression of either wild-type c-Neu or mutationally activated Neu T by ∼10–20-fold (Fig. 4). Importantly, the empty vector used to express caveolin-1 had no effect by itself. Additionally, overexpression of β-galactosidase had no inhibitory effect on wild-type c-Neu- or Neu T-mediated signaling (data not shown). We next employed this assay system and a variety of caveolin-1 deletion mutants to map this caveolin-1-dependent inhibitory activity to a given region of the caveolin-1 molecule. The caveolin-1 deletion mutants that were used are shown schematically in Fig.5 A. Note that the full-length caveolin-1 molecule contains residues 1–178 (α-isoform), the β-isoform lacks residues 1–31, ΔC lacks residues 141–178 of the C-terminal domain, and ΔN lacks residues 1–95 of the N-terminal domain. These constructs have all been previously characterized and are expressed to equivalent levels in transfected cells (25Song K.S. Tang Z.-L. Li S. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4398-4403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Fig.5 B shows the results of this mutational analysis. Virtually identical results were obtained for both wild-type c-Neu and mutationally activated Neu T. Relative to wild-type full-length caveolin-1 (FL; α-isoform), ΔC was ∼10–20-fold more potent, and ΔN was ∼10-fold less potent; the β-isoform was almost as potent as wild-type full-length caveolin-1. From this mutational analysis, we can conclude that the in vivo inhibitory activity of caveolin-1 is contained within the N-terminal domain and, to a first approximation, within caveolin-1 residues 32–95. One possible explanation for the ability of caveolin-1 to impede Neu-mediated signal transduction is that caveolin-1 interacts directly with the Neu tyrosine kinase. We decided to test this hypothesis by examining the effects of synthetic peptides derived from caveolin-1 on the in vitro kinase activity of c-Neu. Fig. 6 Ashows that the antibody used for these experiments efficiently immunoprecipitated recombinantly expressed c-Neu. The potential inhibitory activity of caveolin-1-derived peptides was evaluated using an in vitro kinase assay that measures the activity of immunopurified recombinant wild-type c-Neu (Fig. 6, B andC). Only the caveolin-1 peptide encoding caveolin-1 residues 61–101 or 82–101 showed significant inhibitory activity, whereas a peptide encoding an adjacent region of caveolin-1 (residues 53–81) had no effect at the same concentration. Note that residues 82–101 correspond to the scaffolding domain (SD) of caveolin-1. However, if the peptide encoding caveolin-1 residues 82–101 was divided into two shorter peptides (residues 84–92 and 93–101), its inhibitory activity was abolished. In this in vitro kinase assay, the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain inhibited the autophosphorylation of c-Neu with an IC50 between 0.3 and 1.0 μm (Fig.6 C). These values correspond well to those observed previously for inhibition of other kinases involved in signal transduction by the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide (19Li S. Couet J. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29182-29190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 26Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

The Neu(c-erbB2) proto-oncogene is amplified and overexpressed in a significant proportion of human mammary tumors (1Dickson R.B. Lippman M.E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 559-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 2King C.R. Kraus M.H. Aaronson S.A. Science. 1985; 229: 974-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Are our current findings relevant in whole animals and specifically to mammary tumorigenesis? To answer this question, we chose to evaluate the expression of caveolin-1 protein in normal mouse mammary tissue and in mammary tumors from an established mouse model of c-Neu-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Targeted overexpression is achieved by using the MMTV long terminal repeat to drive mammary-specific expression of a given oncogene. Using this strategy, mammary tumorigenesis can be induced by targeted overexpression of several different classes of oncogenes, including the c-Neu receptor tyrosine kinases (9Bouchard L. Lamarre L. Trembley P.J. Jolicoeur P. Cell. 1989; 57: 931-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Src) (20Webster M.A. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7849-7853Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), nuclear transcription factors (Myc) (21Hundley J. Koester S. Troyer D. Hilsenbeck S. Barrington R. Windle J. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 600-603PubMed Google Scholar), and cytoplasmic GTPases (Ras) (28Sinn E. Muller W. Pattengale P. Tepler I. Wallace R. Leder P. Cell. 1987; 49: 465-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows a Western blot analysis of the expression of caveolin-1 protein in 10 independent mammary tumors, each derived from a different MMTV-Neu transgenic mouse. Normal virgin mammary tissue served as positive controls for caveolin-1 expression. Immunoblotting with anti-tubulin antibodies served as a control for equal loading. Note that loss or dramatic reduction of caveolin-1 expression occurred in mammary tumors derived from several independent c-Neu-expressing transgenic lines. Src family tyrosine kinases and Ras are thought to be downstream components of the Neu signaling pathway and have also been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis. Thus, we next examined caveolin-1 expression in mammary tumors from mice transgenically expressing MMTV-Src and MMTV-Ras. Fig. 8 shows that as with MMTV-Neu tumors, caveolin-1 expression was also dramatically reduced or undetectable in these tumors as well. Also, virtually identical results were obtained with tumors from MMTV-Myc mice. The histopathological appearances of these 25 independent mammary tumors included four distinct types of mammary tumors: comedo, scirrhous, papillary, and acinar adenocarcinomas. Mammary tissue consists of a complex array of cells, including the mammary epithelium, fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and many other cell types. However, it remains unknown whether caveolin-1 is expressed in normal mammary epithelium. Caveolin-1 expression has been well documented in fibroblasts, adipocytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Thus, “down-regulation” of caveolin-1 expression observed by Western analysis may simply reflect tumor mass derived from mammary epithelium that normally lacks caveolin-1 expression. To examine this possibility, we immunolocalized caveolin-1 within normal mammary tissue. Our results indicate that caveolin-1 is normally abundant in the mammary epithelial cells, as the alveolar ductal epithelia were quite brightly stained with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody probe (Fig. 9). We next examined the distribution of caveolin-1 expression in mammary tumors derived from all four transgenic mouse models of mammary tumorigenesis (Fig. 9). In all cases, little or no caveolin-1 staining of the tumor mass itself was observed. However, adjacent fibro-fatty connective tissue remained caveolin-1-positive, and the vasculature within the tumors (consisting of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells) was also brightly stained. These results clearly show that caveolin-1 is abundantly expressed in normal mammary epithelium, but that cancerous transformed mammary tumor cells have lost caveolin-1 expression. Caveolae are plasma membrane-attached vesicular organelles with a diameter of ∼50–100 nm (29Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 231-235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 30Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Scherer P.S. Lisanti M.P. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolae play a pivotal role in a number of essential cellular functions, including signal transduction, lipid metabolism, cellular growth control, and apoptotic cell death. The principal protein components of caveolae are the caveolin family of proteins, termed caveolin-1, -2, and -3 (29Lisanti M.P. Scherer P. Tang Z.-L. Sargiacomo M.

Med. 1997; 7: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Caveolins provide a means for caveolin-interacting proteins to be concentrated within caveolae membranes. Caveolins interact directly with a number of caveolae-associated signaling molecules, such as Ha-Ras, heterotrimeric G-proteins, epidermal growth factor receptor, protein kinase C, Src family tyrosine kinases, and nitric-oxide synthase isoforms (19Li S.

In many of these cases, it has been documented that caveolin binding can effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of these signaling molecules in vitro. Three caveolin genes have been identified thus far: Cav-1,Cav-2, and Cav-3. Caveolin-1 mRNA gives rise to two isoforms via alternate translation initiation from methionines 1 and 32, resulting in caveolin-1α (residues 1–178) and caveolin-1β (residues 32–178) (12Scherer P.E.

Caveolin-1 and -2 appear to be most highly expressed in endothelial cells and adipocytes (13Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P.

As caveolin-1 was the first caveolin family member to be identified, it has served as the prototype for the study of caveolins and caveolae function. Caveolin-1 is a 22–24-kDa integral membrane protein that consists of 178 amino acid residues. The central region of caveolin-1 contains a string of 33 hydrophobic amino acids that function as a membrane anchor, allowing caveolin-1 to assume a hairpin configuration with both N- and C-terminal domains facing the cytoplasm. Residues 61–100 of caveolin-1 function to direct the self-oligomerization of caveolin-1 and as a plasma membrane-bound scaffold to sequester specific caveolin-interacting proteins within caveolae membranes (19Li S.

Here, we show that mutational activation of c-Neu down-regulates caveolin-1 protein expression, but not caveolin-2, in cultured NIH 3T3 and Rat 1 cells. A dramatic reduction of caveolin-1 expression also occurs in mammary tumors derived from c-Neu-expressing transgenic mice and other transgenic mice expressing downstream effectors of Neu-mediated signal transduction. Conversely, recombinant overexpression of caveolin-1 blocks Neu-mediated signal transductionin vivo. Results from this mutational analysis show that this in vivo inhibitory activity is contained within caveolin-1 residues 32–95. Furthermore, a specific peptide encoding the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (residues 82–101) inhibits Neu tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. These results suggest a reciprocal relationship between c-Neu tyrosine kinase activity and caveolin-1 protein expression. Our present results are consistent with a number of independent experimental observations. (i) Transformation of NIH 3T3 cells with oncogenic forms of Abl or Ras is sufficient to down-regulate caveolin-1 protein expression; however, caveolin-2 protein levels remain unchanged (13Scherer P.E. Lewis R.Y. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Galbiati F. Couet J. Kohtz D.S. van Donselaar E. Peters P. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

(ii) A variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (platelet-derived growth factor receptor, insulin receptor, nerve growth factor receptor (trk), EGFR, and c-Neu) have been shown to co-fractionate with caveolin-1 in a variety of cell fractionation approaches (26Couet J.

A. 1997; 94: 13666-13670Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). (iii) Caveolin-1 can interact directly with the EGFR in vitro, through the recognition of a conserved caveolin-binding motif within the kinase domain; this interaction is sufficient to inhibit the in vitro autophosphorylation of the purified EGFR kinase domain (26Couet J. Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30429-30438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). However, the in vivo relevance of these results has remained unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that caveolin-1 inhibits Neu-mediated signaling in vivo andin vitro. As Neu possesses a putative caveolin-1-binding motif within its kinase domain that is identical to that of the EGFR (DVWSYGVTVWEL in both c-Neu and the EGFR), it is not unreasonable to suspect a direct interaction between c-Neu and caveolin-1. Of note, we observed an interesting difference between the effects of c-Neu overexpression in cultured cells and in transgenic mice. In cultured Rat 1 cells, overexpression of wild-type c-Neu was not sufficient to effectively down-regulate caveolin-1. In striking contrast, targeted expression of wild-type c-Neu in mouse mammary cells was sufficient to down-regulate caveolin-1 in mammary tumors. These results suggest that mammary cells in vivo may be more sensitive to the down-regulation of caveolin-1. Alternatively, c-Neu may have undergone somatic mutations during the process of mammary tumorigenesis, as has been documented previously (8Bargmann C.I. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 2043-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In addition, these findings point out that, in some instances, results with cultured cells may not adequately reflect the in vivo situation. This is particularly relevant in the case of caveolin-1, as many cell lines that we have examined lack caveolin-1 expression, whereas caveolin-1 is well expressed in the corresponding tissue in vivo. In many instances, these cell lines were derived from the primary culture of tumors, suggesting that caveolin-1 expression may be very sensitive to down-regulation during cell transformation. However, more examples will be necessary before we can conclude that caveolin-1 down-regulation is a general response to any form of cell transformation. As amplification or mutational activation of Neu occurs in humans and has been implicated in the development of human breast cancers, our current experimental observations may have implications for the future diagnosis or treatment of human breast cancers. For example, it will be important to examine the possible relationship among c-Neuamplification/activation, caveolin-1 down-regulation, and clinical outcome in patients with breast cancers.

https://openalex.org/W1985192341,"The present study underlines the importance of reactive oxygen species in cytokine-mediated degradation of sphingomyelin (SM) to ceramide. Treatment of rat primary astrocytes with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) or interleukin-1β led to marked alteration in cellular redox (decrease in intracellular GSH) and rapid degradation of SM to ceramide. Interestingly, pretreatment of astrocytes with <i>N</i>-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant and efficient thiol source for glutathione, prevented cytokine-induced decrease in GSH and degradation of sphingomyelin to ceramide, whereas treatment of astrocytes with diamide, a thiol-depleting agent, alone caused degradation of SM to ceramide. Moreover, potent activation of SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation were observed by direct addition of an oxidant like hydrogen peroxide or a prooxidant like aminotriazole. Similar to NAC, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate, another antioxidant, was also found to be a potent inhibitor of cytokine-induced degradation of SM to ceramide indicating that cytokine-induced hydrolysis of sphingomyelin is redox-sensitive. Besides astrocytes, NAC also blocked cytokine-mediated ceramide production in rat primary oligodendrocytes, microglia, and C<sub>6</sub> glial cells. Inhibition of TNF-α- and diamide-mediated depletion of GSH, elevation of ceramide level, and DNA fragmentation (apoptosis) in primary oligodendrocytes by NAC, and observed depletion of GSH, elevation of ceramide level, and apoptosis in banked human brains from patients with neuroinflammatory diseases (<i>e.g.</i> X-adrenoleukodystrophy and multiple sclerosis) suggest that the intracellular level of GSH may play a critical role in the regulation of cytokine-induced generation of ceramide leading to apoptosis of brain cells in these diseases."

Histatins should be added to the described families of natural antibiotics produced by host tissues in contact with indigenous microorganisms (19Gabay J.E. Science. 1994; 264 (373): 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These antimicrobial proteins are produced by a variety of tissues and organisms as a means of nonimmune host defense. Although Hsts have similar size and net positive charge as other naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides, they possess structural features unique from other described low molecular weight cationic proteins. The high histidine content, lack of disulfide bonds, and weak amphipathic character of the α-helical structures distinguish Hsts from the known natural antimicrobial proteins such as defensins, bactenecins, and cecropins (19Gabay J.E.

Lytic properties have also been described for the polyene antimycotics, which are currently used drugs in treatment of candidiasis. Polyene antimycotics form pores in the plasma membrane by complex formation with ergosterol of the plasma membrane (28Beggs W.G. Antimicrob.

These drugs have additional secondary effects on inhibition of plasma membrane ATPase leading to proton efflux as well as reduction of activity of many biosynthetic enzymes (29Bolard J. Candida albicans: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Springer Verlag, New York1991: 214-238Crossref Google Scholar). The synthetic azole derivatives are the other major class of antifungal drugs. The azole-based drugs act on yeast mitochondria and through a complex multistep pathway inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of yeast plasma membranes (30Vanden Bossche H.

Denepitiya L. MacKay B.J. Ionoco V.J. Infect. Immun. 1984; 44: 702-707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further, Hsts were effective in killing azole-resistant Candida species, thus implicating a different mechanism of Hst action from that of the azole-based antifungal drugs (34O'Connell B.C. Xu T.

Agents Chemother. 1997; 41: 2224-2228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies using Hst 5 variants with one or two amino acid substitutions showed that His18, Lys13, Arg22, and the dipeptide sequence Phe14/His15 may be important for optimal activity (36Tsai H. Raj P.A. Bobek L.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5000-5007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Hst 5 variants with reduced killing ability exhibited similar helical content to Hst 5, suggesting that the α-helical conformation alone is not solely responsible for optimal candidacidal activity (36Tsai H. Raj P.A. Bobek L.A. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 5000-5007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although earlier potassium release results suggested that Hsts' biological effects may be related to direct peptide-membrane interactions, recent structural studies of the active fragment of Hst (37Raj P.A. Sunil-Datta S. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9610-9619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and two-dimensional NMR studies of Hst 5 (38Raj P.A. Marcus E. Sukumaran D.K. Biopolymers. 1998; 45: 51-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) revealed that the weak amphipathic character of the helical structure precludes spontaneous insertion into the membrane. The size of the active fragment (16 residues) also argues against its ability to function as a channel-forming peptide. Moreover, the yeast cell wall is rich in mannoproteins and glucans containing anionic sites, which may form electrostatic complexes with Hsts and prevent interaction with the cell membrane. Hsts' potent antifungal activity, lack of toxicity to humans, and ability to kill azole-resistant yeast strains underscore the importance of detailed understanding of their mechanism of action. In this study, we examined whether Hsts can induce direct physicochemical damage to yeast cell membranes (cationic peptide model) or whether binding to a specific yeast component is required for Hst killing by performing biological and fluorescent dye release assays, Hst binding, and cross-linking studies on C. albicans intact cells and spheroplasts. C. albicans strain DS1 was isolated from the palate of a denture stomatitis patient (39Edgerton M. Scannapieco F.A. Reddy M.S. Levine M.J. Infect.

C. albicans was maintained on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates as described previously (17Raj P.A. Edgerton M. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3898-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and S. cerevisiae was maintained on YPD agar plates. C. albicans was inoculated into 10 ml of sucrose-salts-biotin yeast synthetic medium (SSB) (17Raj P.A. Edgerton M. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3898-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Sundstrom P. Kenny G.E. Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 350-855Crossref Google Scholar), andS. cerevisiae was inoculated into 10 ml of YPD medium. Cells were grown to stationary phase for 48 h at 25 °C with rotary agitation at 200 rpm. Blastoconidial cell morphology and cell numbers were determined by phase contrast microscopy using a cell counting chamber. C. albicans cells were grown for 48 h at 25 °C in SSB medium and converted to spheroplasts with Zymolyase 20T (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) as described (42Jazwinski M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 154-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, C. albicans cells from 10-ml cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 600 ×g, washed twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA), and resuspended in 900 μl/g wet weight cells spheroplasting buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 m sorbitol as an osmotic protector). After the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 30 mm and 150 units Zymolyase-20T/g wet weight yeast cells, cells were incubated for 1–1.5 h at 30 °C with gently shaking. Spheroplast formation was monitored microscopically by lysis of osmotically sensitive cells in 5% SDS; under these conditions, more than 90% of the cells were converted to spheroplasts. Spheroplasts were washed twice and resuspended in buffer containing 1m sorbitol for further use. In some cases, spheroplasts were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Antifungal activity of Hsts was examined by microdilution plate assay as described previously (17Raj P.A. Edgerton M. Levine M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3898-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Fungicidal assays were performed on stationaryC. albicans cells in the presence or absence of Hst 5, Hst 3, Hst 4, Hst M, Hst 4a, or Hst 3 C (0.98–125 μm) or 500 μm amylase, cytochrome c, and insulin-β-chain. Briefly, C. albicans cells were washed twice with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4), pH 7.4, and resuspended at 1.8 × 105 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (20 μl) were mixed with 20 μl of 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing the indicated proteins and incubated for various times at 37 °C with shaking. Control cultures were incubated with 20 μl of 10 mm phosphate buffer alone. The reaction was stopped by addition of 360 μl of yeast nitrogen base (YNB); 40 μl of the suspension (360 cells) were spread onto Sabouraud dextrose agar plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. In some experiments, candidacidal assays were performed in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, with 1 m sorbitol. In preliminary experiments, Hst 5 candidacidal activity was tested in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing either 1 msorbitol, 2 mg/ml BSA, 0.6 m KCl, 0.5 m NaCl, or in 40 mm HEPES. Hst 5 activity was unaffected in 10 mm phosphate buffer containing 1 m sorbitol or 2 mg/ml BSA; however, it was completely inhibited in buffers containing high salt concentration or in HEPES buffer and therefore these reagents were not used throughout the experiments. Candidacidal assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. Loss of viability was calculated as [1 − (colonies from suspension with peptide/colonies from suspension with no protein)] × 100. The Hst concentration required to kill 50% of colony-forming unit yeast cells (LD50) was calculated from the dose-response curves. Statistical significance of the results was calculated using Student's t test. Cell permeability was monitored by release of the intracellular dye calcein. Following cellular uptake of calcein acetoxymethyl ester (calcein-AM), intracellular esterases convert the molecule into a nonpermeable acid form of calcein. Intracellularly, high concentration of dye leads to energy exchange between calcein molecules resulting in quenching. Leakage of calcein into the extracellular media was detected by measuring characteristic fluorescence emission spectra. Calcein-AM loading of C. albicans cells was performed on early stationary phase"
https://openalex.org/W2067405328,"The sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter is a plasma membrane protein responsible for concentrative cellular accumulation of myo-inositol in a variety of tissues. When cells in kidney and brain are exposed to a hyperosmolar salt condition (hypertonicity) due to the operation of urinary concentration mechanism and pathological conditions, respectively, they survive the stress of hypertonicity by raising the cellular concentration ofmyo-inositol. Transcription of the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter gene is markedly stimulated in response to hypertonicity, leading to an increase in the activity of the cotransporter, which in turn drives the osmoprotective accumulation of myo-inositol. To understand the molecular mechanisms by which hypertonicity stimulates transcription, we analyzed the 5′-flanking region of the cotransporter gene forcis-acting regulatory sequences. We identified five tonicity-responsive enhancers that are scattered over 50 kilobase pairs. All the enhancers are variations of the same type of enhancer interacting with the transcription factor named tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein. In vivo methylation experiments demonstrated that exposure of cells to hypertonicity increases the binding of tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein to the enhancer sites, indicating that all of these enhancers are involved in the transcriptional stimulation. We conclude that the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter gene is regulated by a large region (∼50 kilobase pairs) upstream of the gene.

Since two sodium ions are coupled per molecule of MI (2Hager K. Hazama A. Kwon H.M. Loo D.D.F. Handler J.S. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), SMIT can transport MI against a 1,000-fold concentration gradient,i.e. 50 mm in a cell versus 50 μm in the plasma. The level of SMIT activity determines the steady-state cellular concentration of MI at the point where uptake and leak balance out. the sodium/myo-inositol cotransporter myo-inositol the sodium- and chloride-coupled betaine/γ-aminobutyrate transporter aldose reductase tonicity-responsive enhancer TonE-binding protein electrophoretic mobility shift assay Madin-Darby canine kidney polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) kilobase pair(s). SMIT is most abundantly expressed in the kidney medulla (1Kwon H.M. Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Handler J.S. J. Biol.

Invest. 1995; 96: 1195-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which is hypertonic most of the time because of the operation of the urinary concentration mechanisms. The high level of SMIT expression in the renal medulla is secondary to the hypertonicity of this tissue in that SMIT mRNA abundance changes pari passu with the tonicity of the medulla (3Yamauchi A.

Noguchi T. Fujiwara Y. Kamada T. Ueda N. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1994; 5: 62-67PubMed Google Scholar). The changes in mRNA abundance are primarily due to changes in transcription (5Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F20-F23PubMed Google Scholar). When SMIT is inhibited under hypertonic conditions in cultured cells (6Kitamura H. Yamauchi A. Nakanishi T. Takamitsu Y. Sugiura T. Akagi A. Moriyama T. Horio M. Imai E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F267-F272PubMed Google Scholar) or in kidneys in vivo (7Kitamura H. Yamauchi A. Sugiura T. Matsuoka Y. Horio M. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Imai E. Hori M. Kidney Int. 1998; 53: 146-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), cells undergo necrosis demonstrating the importance of maintaining a high level of SMIT activity in a hypertonic environment. How elevated SMIT activity protects the renal cells is explained by the theory of compatible osmolytes (8Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). It is useful to note that osmolarity inside a mammalian cell is always in equilibrium with interstitial osmolarity because blood facing plasma membranes are highly permeable to water and very compliant mechanically. Immediately after cells are exposed to hypertonicity, cellular ionic strength is elevated due to osmosis. When the cells are kept in hypertonicity for more than several hours, they accumulate small organic solutes called compatible osmolytes and, as a result, lower cellular ionic strength toward the isotonic level. If and when accumulation of compatible osmolytes is prevented, cells do not survive (6Kitamura H. Yamauchi A. Nakanishi T. Takamitsu Y. Sugiura T. Akagi A. Moriyama T. Horio M. Imai E. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F267-F272PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kitamura H. Yamauchi A. Sugiura T. Matsuoka Y. Horio M. Tohyama M. Shimada S. Imai E. Hori M.

Invest. 1991; 88: 656-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), probably because of the effects of elevated cellular ionic strength (8Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3030) Google Scholar). The major compatible osmolytes in the hypertonic medulla are MI, betaine, sorbitol, taurine, and glycerophosphorylcholine (10Garcia-Perez A. Burg M.B. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 1081-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Like MI, accumulation of betaine and sorbitol is also regulated at the level of transcription; hypertonicity stimulates transcription of the genes for the sodium- and chloride-coupled betaine/γ-aminobutyric acid transporter (BGT1) and aldose reductase (AR: catalyzes synthesis of sorbitol), leading to an increase in their activity, which results in an increase in cellular concentration of betaine and sorbitol (11Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The signal for stimulation of transcription is most likely the cellular ionic strength because induction of AR correlates highly with the sum of cellular sodium and potassium concentration (12Uchida S. Garcia-Perez A. Murphy H. Burg M.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C614-C620Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of BGT1 (13Ferraris J.D. Burg M.B. Williams C.K. Peters E.M. Garcia-Perez A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C650-C6514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and SMIT (14Kwon H.M. Strange K. Cellular and Molecular Physiology of Cell Volume Regulation. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993: 383-394Google Scholar) mRNA also correlates positively with cellular ionic strength. During hypernatremia, which results in systemic hypertonicity, brain (15Gullans S.R. Verbalis J.G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and eye (16Zhou C. Cammarata P. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 35: 349-363Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) accumulate compatible osmolytes including MI. SMIT mRNA is expressed throughout brain in neurons and glial cells (17Minami Y. Inoue K. Shimada S. Morimura H. Miyai A. Yamauchi A. Matsunaga T. Tohyama M. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and in eye (18Morimura H. Shimada S. Otori Y. Yamauchi A. Minami Y. Inoue K. Miyai A. Ishimoto I. Tano Y. Tohyama M. Mol.

Brain Res. 1996; 35: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), presumably due to an increase in transcription. Thus, the SMIT gene in non-renal cells responds to hypertonicity in the same way as it does in renal cells. Studies of regulatory cis-elements involved in the regulation of transcription uncovered two tonicity-responsive enhancers (TonEs) within 185 bp upstream of the BGT1 gene (20Takenaka M. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29379-29381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2H. Miyakawa, J. S. Rim, and H. M. Kwon, unpublished observations. The AR gene is regulated by three TonEs located about 1 kb upstream of the transcription start site (21Ko B.C.B. Ruepp B. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Chung S.S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16431-16437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). All the TonEs of the BGT1 and AR genes are functionally the same; they share a high level of sequence similarity, and all of them specifically bind to a nuclear protein named TonE-binding protein (TonEBP) (22Miyakawa H.

When kidney-derived MDCK cells are exposed to hypertonicity, the activity of TonEBP is stimulated leading to the binding of TonEBP to TonE sites of the BGT1 gene and concurrent stimulation of transcription (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, stimulation of TonEBP activity is central to the hypertonicity-induced stimulation of transcription. In this study, the 5′-flanking region of the SMIT gene is analyzed to identify regulatory cis-elements. Five TonEs spread over 50 kb are identified. All of them appear to contribute to the regulation of SMIT gene transcription, indicating that regulation of SMIT involves unusually but not unprecedentedly long range interactions between regulatory sequences and promoter. MDCK cells were maintained in defined medium as described previously (5Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F20-F23PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained in Eagle's spinner modification of minimum essential medium (Biofluids) supplemented with 5% horse serum. Medium was made hypertonic by adding 200 mm raffinose to defined medium or 100 mmNaCl to Eagle's spinner modification of minimum essential medium. DNA from two P1 clones, 3283 and 3284 (23Mallee J.J. Atta M.G. Lorica V.L. Rim J.S. Kwon H.M. Lucente A.D. Wang Y. Berry G.T. Genomics. 1997; 46: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was digested with NotI, ClaI, or MluI and then size-fractionated by pulse-field electrophoresis using the following settings: initial A time 1 s, final A time 10 s, A/B ratio of 1,200 V, run time 20 h in 0.5× TBE containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm borate, and 1 mmEDTA. Southern blots were prepared and probed with T7 and SP6 oligonucleotides (specific for the P1 vector sequence flanking the cloning site) as well as various restriction fragments to delineate the restriction map shown in Fig. 1. To localize the S14 and S31 fragments (Fig. 1), P1 clones 3283 and 3284 were linearized with NotI digestion and then a series of SacI partial digestions with progressively less amount of enzyme were obtained. Southern blots of the partially digested DNA was hybridized to T7 oligonucleotide to determine the location of S14 and S31 fragments. The results were confirmed by hybridization of S14 and S31 fragments to Southern blots of P1 DNA. In order to obtain subclones of the 5′-flanking region of the human SMIT gene, DNA from the P1 3283 was digested with SacI and shot-gun cloned in pBluescriptII (Stratagen). Clones derived from the 5′-flanking region were identified by hybridization to Southern blots of NotI-digested P1 clone 3283. Nine non-overlapping SacI clones that cover 47 kb out of the 60-kb 5′ franking region of human SMIT gene (see Fig. 1) were obtained. To test tonicity-responsive regulatory activity of theSacI fragments, each SacI fragment was subcloned in front of the SMIT promoter ((−128/+134) fragment) and the luciferase reporter gene using pGL2-basic (Promega) (23Mallee J.J.

Some of theSacI fragments displaying enhancer activity were divided into smaller fragments (see Fig. 2), which were again tested for tonicity-responsive enhancer activity as above. Likewise, synthetic DNA fragments (Table I and Fig. 3) were also tested for tonicity-responsive enhancer activity.Table ISynthetic double-stranded TonE sequences used for luciferase reporter gene constructs and electrophoretic mobility shift assayNameSequenceTonEAagctGCAAGTGGAAAACTACCAAGA CGTTCACCTTTTGATGGTTCTttaaTonEB1agctCAGAGATAGAATTCCACATTT GTCTCTATCTTAAGGTGTAAAttaaTonEB2/3agctTTAGCTGGAAAATTCCAAACA AATCGACCTTTTAAGGTTTGTttaaTonEC1agctAGAGGTGGAAAATTACAGGCA TCTCCACCTTTTAATGTCCGTttaaTonEC2agctTGGCATGGAAAGTTACTCAAA ACCGTACCTTTCAATGAGTTTttaaTonEC3agctTAAAAAGGGAGTTCCAGCATC ATTTTTCCCTCAAGGTCGTAGttaaTonEpagctAGGCATGGAAAGTTCCAGCCG TCCGTACCTTTCAAGGTCGGCttaaTonEB1 (2/3)agctCAGAGATAGAATTCCACATTTTTAGCTGGAAAATTCCAAACA GTCTCTATCTTAAGGTGTAAAAATCGACCTTTTAAGGTTTGTttaaTonEC123agctAGAGGTGGAAAATTACAGGCATGGCATGGAAAGTTACTCAAATAAAAAGGGAGTTCCAGCATC TCTCCACCTTTTAATGTCCGTACCGTACCTTTCAATGAGTTTATTTTTCCCTCAAGGTCGTAGttaaEach DNA contains one, two, or three TonE sequences with 10 bp of flanking sequence (5 bp from each side) per each TonE.

TonEA in S14-c and TonEB(2/3) in S14-g were inactivated (as indicated by X marks) by mutating key nucleotide residues as described under “Experimental Procedures” to generate S14-c/mTonEA and S14-g/mTonE(2/3), respectively.

In other DNAs, TonE sequences marked byX were mutated by changing the 2nd G to T, the 5th A to T, and the 9th pyrimidine to G.

TonE sequences in the S14-c and S14-g fragments (Fig. 3) were mutated to inactivate their enhancer activity using PCR. To mutate TonEA, fragment S14-c was separately amplified with two pairs of primers. The first pair was gggctgcatTGGGTGTTTTTATGGGA (primer A1; the sequence at one end of S14-c is in uppercase letters, and the PstI site added is shown in lowercase letters) and GCTCTTGGTcGTTaTCaACTTGC (TonEA portion is underlined (antisense strand); lowercase letters represent mutations) while the second pair was GCAAGTtGAtAACgACCAAGAGC (TonEA portion is underlined (sense strand); lowercase letters represent mutations) and gggctgacgGCGGAACAGCAGAT (primer A2; the sequence at one end of S14-c is in uppercase letters, and the PstI site added is shown in lowercase letters). To generate S14-c with mutations in TonEA, aliquots (1 μl each) of the two PCR products were mixed and subjected to PCR amplification using primer A1 and A2. The resulting mutations were confirmed by sequencing. TonEB2 in the S14-g was mutated in the same way using the following two sets of primers: gggctgcagGAATTCCACATTTCGTT (primer B1) and GATGTTTGGcATTaTCaAGCTAA (TonEB2/3 is underlined; antisense strand); TTAGCTtGAtAATgCCAAACATC (TonEB2/3 is underlined; sense strand) and gggctgcagAAGCTTCTTTCCTAGTC (primer B2). These mutations in TonEB2 are also expected (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J.

All the mutant fragments were sequenced completely to confirm the mutations and also to verify that the sequence outside the TonE regions remain unchanged.Table IISequence of the SMIT TonEsNameLocationSequencesRemarksTonEAS14-cTGGAAAACTACTonEB1S14-gTGGAATTCTATNot activeTonEB2S14-gTGGAAAATTCCOverlap with TonEB3TonEB3S14-gTGGAATTTTCCProbably not activeTonEC1S31-dTGGAAAATTACSame as “hTonE”TonEC2S31-dTGGAAAGTTACTonEC3S31-dTGGAACTCCCTNot activeTonEp−331/−321TGGAAAGTTCCConsensusYGGAANNNYNYRef.22Miyakawa H.

Primer mC1 (gggctcgagAGAGGTtGAtAATgACAGGCA) was used in place of primer C1 to mutate TonEC1 in S31-ds. Likewise, primer mC2 (cccctgcagTGAGTcACTaTCaATGCCACC) was used to mutate TonEC2. All these fragments were sequenced completely for verification. The reporter plasmid constructs were transfected into MDCK cells using the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μg of each reporter construct or 10 ng of β-actin construct (the luciferase gene under the strong promoter of the β-actin gene) was transfected with 50 ng of pRL/CMV, a plasmid containing the Renilla luciferase gene under control of CMV promoter. Transfected cells were cultured in isotonic defined medium for 20 h and then for an additional 20 h in isotonic or hypertonic medium. Cell extracts were prepared, and the activity ofPhotinus and Renilla luciferase was determined using dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). For each extract, the activity of the Photinus luciferase was divided by the activity of the Renilla luciferase to correct for transfection efficiency. Under each tonicity condition, i.e.isotonic or hypertonic, the corrected activity from cells transfected with a test construct was again divided by that from cells transfected with the β-actin construct. The resulting luciferase activity standardized for the β-actin promoter was used to calculate -fold induction of luciferase by hypertonicity: activity of luciferase in hypertonic medium divided by activity of luciferase in isotonic medium. Each experiment (n = 1) was performed in duplicate dishes. MDCK cells or HeLa cells cultured in isotonic or hypertonic medium were chilled to 4 °C, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare probes for EMSA shown in Table I, single-stranded oligonucleotides were synthesized and purified. 200 pmol each of complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 100 μl containing 100 mm NaCl to obtain a double-stranded probe. Five μg of nuclear extract was incubated initially for 10 min at room temperature in 20 μl containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.5 μg of poly(dA-dT), 5 mm MgCl2. The mixture was then incubated for an additional 20 min after adding32P-labeled probe with or without an unlabeled competitor. The reaction was electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel (79:1, acrylamide:bis) in 0.5× TBE buffer. The gel was dried and exposed to a PhosphorImage screen. The radioactivity was visualized and quantified using PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). In order to methylate G residues of the genomic DNA in vivo, HeLa cells in isotonic or hypertonic medium were incubated in the same medium containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfate for 2 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice to remove dimethyl sulfate, and DNA was isolated. The methylated DNA was converted to a single-stranded form and cleaved at sites immediately 3′ to the methylated G residues by treatment with piperidine (Sigma) at 90 °C for 30 min. The cleaved G residues were detected using ligation-mediated PCR as described (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar). The cleaved DNA was annealed to primer AP1 (CTCACTGTTCAACAAAAGCCC), BP1 (GTGACCTCATGGGTGGTGGT), CP1 (GATAGAATGAGGTGGGAGGA), or pP1 (GAATGTTCCAGAACCCCTG) to synthesize the first strand DNA covering the TonEA, TonEB2, TonEC2, or TonEp region, respectively. A staggered double-stranded linker (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated, and 18 cycles of PCR were performed at the specific annealing temperature using a nested primer: AP2 (CTCCCATGCAGTGAAGAGCTGGCCC), BP2 (TGGGGAAGACAGCAGCAGAAGCAAG), CP2 (GAGGCAGGCAGCTTGGAACCAAGAA), or pP2 (TTCCAGAACCCCTGCGAGCAGCCGTT). Two additional rounds of PCR were performed using a 32P-labeled nested primer. The reaction was electrophoresed on a sequencing gel with sequencing ladder. Radioactivity was detected and quantified as described above. Previously, we cloned the canine SMIT gene and a total of 15 kb of flanking sequence (11 kb from the 5′ side and 4 kb from the 3′ side) from overlapping λ clones (24Rim J.S. Tana S. Takenaka M. Handler J.S. Kwon H.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341 (1997): 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When we examined the entire cloned region including the flanking regions for tonicity-responsive regulatory activity, we detected only a small tonicity-responsive enhancer activity, less than 2-fold stimulation of the SMIT promoter in response to hypertonicity (see below), which is localized within (−2,900/−119) relative nucleotide region. Other investigators (16Zhou C. Cammarata P. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 35: 349-363Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) studying the bovine SMIT gene reported a TonE sequence similar to those of the BGT1 and AR genes (22Miyakawa H. Woo S.K. Chen C.P. Dahl S.C. Handler J.H. Kwon H.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F753-F761PubMed Google Scholar) at (−346/−336) relative nucleotide position. This enhancer stimulates the SMIT promoter about 2-fold in response to hypertonicity (16Zhou C. Cammarata P. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 35: 349-363Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Because transcription of the SMIT gene is stimulated over 10-fold under the same hypertonic conditions (5Yamauchi A. Uchida S. Preston A.S. Kwon H.M. Handler J.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F20-F23PubMed Google Scholar, 16Zhou C. Cammarata P. Exp. Eye Res. 1997; 35: 349-363Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), we anticipated more regulatory sequences outside (further upstream and/or downstream) the cloned region. To explore this possibility, we decided to search further upstream of the gene for more tonicity-responsive regulatory sequences. We turned to the two P1 clones (23Mallee J.J. Atta M.G. Lorica V.L. Rim J.S. Kwon H.M. Lucente A.D. Wang Y. Berry G.T. Genomics. 1997; 46: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which contain the human SMIT gene and about 60 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (Fig.1). The structure and sequence of the human SMIT gene is very similar to that of the canine gene (23Mallee J.J. Atta M.G. Lorica V.L. Rim J.S. Kwon H.M. Lucente A.D. Wang Y. Berry G.T. Genomics. 1997; 46: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, like the canine SMIT gene, the immediate 5′-flanking region of the human SMIT gene, the (−2,444/−130) relative nucleotide region, also displayed small tonicity-responsive enhancer activity (23Mallee J.J. Atta M.G. Lorica V.L. Rim J.S. Kwon H.M. Lucente A.D. Wang Y. Berry G.T. Genomics. 1997; 46: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). About 80% of the 60-kb 5′-flanking region was subcloned in nine non-overlapping, SacI restriction fragments. In order to test tonicity-responsive regulatory activity of these fragments, each DNA fragment was cloned in front of the human SMIT promoter and thePhotinus luciferase gene to generate an expression construct as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two of theSacI fragments, S14 (7 kb) and S31 (4 kb), displayed significant, albeit small, tonicity-responsive enhancer activity for the SMIT gene promoter (Fig. 2). Partial digestion and Southern blot analyses of the P1 clones localized S14 and S31 at 50 and 15 kb upstream of the SMIT gene, respectively (Fig. 1). None of the SacI fragments displayed negative regulatory (or suppressor) activity, indicating that, like the BGT1 and AR genes, the SMIT gene is regulated only by enhancers. The DNA fragments S14 and S31 were divided into smaller restriction fragments and tested for tonicity-responsive enhancer activity (Fig.2). The enhancer activity of S14 was narrowed to two small fragments: S14-c (357 bp) and S14-g (588 bp). Likewise, the enhancer activity of S31 was confined to an 877-bp fragment named S31-d. Sequencing of these fragments revealed that each of them contains one or more sequences (Table II) that fit the consensus of TonEs for the BGT1 and AR genes (22Miy"

We investigated the effect of glucosamine on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The Δ-insulin (insulin-stimulated minus basal) value for 2-deoxyglucose uptake was dramatically inhibited with increasing concentrations of glucosamine with an ED50 of 1.95 mm. Subcellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that reduction in insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake by glucosamine was due to an inhibition of translocation of both Glut 1 and Glut 4 from the low density microsomes (LDM) to the plasma membrane. Analysis of the insulin signaling cascade revealed that glucosamine impaired insulin receptor autophosphorylation, insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1) phosphorylation, IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in the LDM, and AKT-1 activation by insulin. Measurement of intracellular ATP demonstrated that the effects of glucosamine were highly correlated with its ability to reduce ATP levels. Reduction of intracellular ATP using azide inhibited Glut 1 and Glut 4 translocation from the LDM to the plasma membrane, insulin receptor autophosphorylation, and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Additionally, both the reduction in intracellular ATP and the effects on insulin action caused by glucosamine could be prevented by the addition of inosine, which served as an alternative energy source in the medium. We conclude that direct administration of glucosamine can rapidly lower cellular ATP levels and affect insulin action in fat cells by mechanisms independent of increased intracellular UDP-N-acetylhexosamines and that increased metabolism of glucose via the hexosamine pathway may not represent the mechanism of glucose toxicity in fat cells.

Insulin resistance is a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis of long term complications of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (1DeFronso R.A. Bonadonna R.C. Ferrannini E. Diabetes Care. 1992; 15: 318-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1903) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia is known to cause insulin resistance. High concentrations of glucose and insulin have been shown to impair insulin-stimulated glucose transport in primary rat adipocytes (2Garvey W.T. Olefsky J.M. Matthaei S. Marshall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 189-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Lima F.B. Bao S. Garvey W.T. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 53-62Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and rat hind limb muscles (4Richter E.A. Hansen B.F. Hansen S.A. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that an increased flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway may be the mechanism by which hyperglycemia leads to insulin resistance (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6McClain D.A. Crook E.D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Only 2–3% of the total glucose taken up by the cell is metabolized by this pathway that ultimately produces UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, which serves as a substrate in the formation of glycoproteins, glycolipids, and proteoglycans. Three lines of evidence led Marshall et al. (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to conclude that hexosamine biosynthesis is involved in insulin resistance. First, glucose and insulin per se were not sufficient to establish insulin resistance of glucose transport in primary adipocytes, but the presence of glutamine was essential (7Traxinger R.R.

(5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the strongest evidence was that glucosamine, entering the pathway downstream of the rate-limiting step, was 40 times more effective than glucose in mediating desensitization of glucose transport (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effects of glucosamine were confirmed by many other studies, in vitro, including studies in primary rat adipocytes (9Chen H. Ing B.L. Robinson K.A. Feagin A.C. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Mol. Cell.

More direct evidence that the hexosamine pathway is involved in insulin resistance is through the overexpression of GFAT. Insulin sensitivity of glycogen synthase was decreased in fibroblasts stably transfected with GFAT (15Crook E.D. Daniels M.C. Smith T.M. McClain D.A.

Marshall B.A. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23197-23202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, a recent study that examined the effect of GFAT overexpression on insulin-stimulated translocation of Glut 4 by co-transfecting primary rat adipose cells with GFAT and an epitope-tagged Glut 4 transporter found that overexpression of GFAT had no effect on the insulin dose-response curve for Glut 4 translocation compared with control cells transfected with only tagged Glut 4 (9Chen H. Ing B.L. Robinson K.A. Feagin A.C. Buse M.G. Quon M.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1997; 135: 66-77Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The authors did observe an inhibition of Glut 4 translocation when adipose cells were treated with glucosamine. Glucosamine has become routinely used to mimic the insulin resistance caused by high glucose and insulin. It is naturally assumed that higher intracellular concentrations of glucosamine will have the same metabolic effect as increasing the flux through the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway. It is not clear, however, what cellular process is specifically affected by glucosamine to confer insulin resistance and whether it is by the same mechanism as high glucose and insulin or even the overexpression of GFAT. To address this question, we investigated the effects of glucosamine on insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results revealed that direct administration of glucosamine can rapidly lower intracellular ATP levels and affect insulin action in fat cells by mechanisms independent of increased intracellular UDP-N-acetylhexosamines. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (22Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10–14 days after differentiation. Cells treated with glucosamine were first washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 6 nm insulin, and various concentrations of glucosamine (Sigma). l-Glucose was added to adjust the osmolarity of the sugars to 25 mm. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1.5 h in the same media but without insulin. Control cells were also pretreated with insulin in the same manner but were incubated in either normal DMEM (25 mmd-glucose) or in glucose-free DMEM supplemented with 25 mml-glucose. Media containing more than 5 mm glucosamine were adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells used in the sodium azide studies were fed with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum the day prior to the experiment. Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were washed three times with PBS and then incubated for 2.5 h at 37 °C in glucose-free DMEM containing 6 or 7 mm sodium azide. [3H]2-Deoxyglucose uptake was measured as described previously (22Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). After the 2.5-h preincubation described above, cells were washed three times with Krebs-Ringer phosphate and then treated or not treated for 20 min at 37 °C with 1 μm insulin. Non-transport-mediated uptake was measured in the presence of 20 μm cytochalasin B. Protein content was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce). Three culture dishes (10 cm) of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated as described above, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C with or without 1 μm insulin, and then washed three times with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm sodium vanadate. Cells were scraped in 12 ml of ice-cold HES buffer (255 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 100 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmsodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors and then homogenized by passing the cells 11 times through a Yamato LSC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rotations/min at 4 °C. Subcellular fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation as described previously (23Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The following protease inhibitors were used: 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml benzamidine, 5 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Glut 1 and Glut 4 transporters were detected by Western blot analysis using specific polyclonal antibodies generated against the final 16 amino acids of each glucose transporter. Phosphotyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were detected using the monoclonal PY-20 antibody (Transduction Laboratories). 125I-Labeled goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (0.25 μCi/ml, ICN, Irvine, CA) was used as the secondary antibody. Radioactive bands were quantitated by a PhosphorImager SI Analyzer (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were treated with 25 mmd-glucose or 20 mm glucosamine for 2.5 h, in which the first hour was in the presence of 6 nm insulin. The cells were then washed and incubated in the same media without insulin for the remaining 1.5 h. Cells were then fractionated after 0, 2, 5, and 15 min of acute 1 μminsulin stimulation as described above. 100 μg of LDM protein were solubilized with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mmNaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mmNaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors and then immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of a polyclonal antibody directed against the carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids of rat liver IRS-1. Immune complexes were bound to protein A-Sepharose beads, and PI 3-kinase activity was determined on the pellets as described by Backer et al. (24Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Kahn C.R. Myers M.G. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1367-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting32P-labeled phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate lipids were separated from the other reaction products by thin layer chromatography (24Backer J.M. Schroeder G.G. Kahn C.R. Myers M.G. Wilden P.A. Cahill D.A. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1367-1374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Autoradiograms were then quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. Two 150-cm culture plates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with 25 mmd-glucose, 20 mml-glucose, or 20 mm glucosamine for 2.5 h, in which the first hour was carried out in the presence of 6 nm insulin and the remaining 1.5 h was without insulin. Cells were washed three times and then scraped in 12 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mmEDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors. Cells were homogenized by passing them 11 times through a Yamato LSC homogenizer at a speed of 1200 rotations/min at 4 °C, total membranes were prepared, and insulin receptors were semipurified by wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose as described previously (25Flores-Riveros J.R. Sibley E. Kastelic T. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21557-21572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 μm insulin was added or not added for 20 min to an aliquot of insulin receptor (10 μg of total protein in 0.1% Triton X-100). Receptors were autophosphorylated for 5 min at room temperature in 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.9), 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mm manganous acetate, and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (25–50 cpm/fmol). RCM-lysozyme (Sigma), was added for 1 min at a final concentration of 100 μm before the reactions were quenched with the addition of EDTA (20 mm final) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were pretreated as described above. Culture plates (3.5 cm) were washed four times with ice-cold PBS and then solubilized with 0.4 ml of ice-cold 0.05 n NaOH. The cell extracts were sheared using a 25-gauge syringe. 120 μl were heated to 80 °C for 20 min and then neutralized with 60 μl of 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.05 n HCl. Protein content was measured and ATP concentrations were determined using the method of Passonneau and Lowry (26Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. 1993; (122–123, The Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ): 10-11Google Scholar). In this procedure, NADPH is assayed as a measure of ATP by using a two-step coupled reaction in which in the first step glucose and hexokinase are added to the ATP sample to produce ADP and glucose 6-phosphate. In the second step, glucose 6-phosphate is converted to NADPH and 6-phosphogluconolactone by NADP and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. NADPH is then measured fluorometrically. To 20 μl of the neutralized cell extract solution, 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 μm glucose, 100 μmNADP+, 2 μg/ml hexokinase, and 0.5 μg/ml leuconostoc mesenteroides glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Calbiochem) were added and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Excess NADP+was then destroyed with the addition of 10 μl of 0.7 nNaOH at 60 °C for 20 min. The fluorescence signal of NADPH was enhanced 8-fold by the addition of 1 ml of 6 n NaOH, 10 mm imidazole base, and 0.01% H2O2(26Passonneau J.V. Lowry O.H. Enzymatic Analysis: A Practical Guide. 1993; (122–123, The Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ): 10-11Google Scholar). Samples were mixed immediately upon addition and incubated for 20 min at 60 °C, and then the fluorescence was measured at 340 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. The fluorescence intensity was converted to μmol/liter using an ATP standard curve generated under identical conditions. Duplicates were done for each sample, blank, and standard curve measurement. ATP values were corrected for protein content in the sample and then normalized to control ATP values (glucose-free DMEM). To determine the effects of increasing flux through the hexosamine pathway on glucose transport, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with increasing concentrations of glucosamine in glucose-free DMEM for 1 h in the presence of 6 nm insulin. The cells were then washed, incubated in the same media without insulin for 1.5 h, then acutely stimulated or not stimulated with 1 μm insulin prior to measuring 2-deoxyglucose uptake (Fig.1 A). Glucose-free media were used, since glucosamine competes poorly with glucose for transport into cells. The 1-h incubation with insulin was done to increase the number of glucose transporters on the plasma membrane and thus facilitate glucosamine uptake. Insulin was removed after 1 h to restore acute insulin sensitivity. In the absence of glucose and glucosamine under these experimental conditions, 2-deoxyglucose uptake increased 2.75-fold with acute insulin from 0.363 to 1.0 on a normalized scale. The rather low -fold increase in insulin-stimulated uptake is due to a glucose starvation effect. Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes in glucose-free DMEM results in a higher basal and insulin-stimulated 2-DOG uptake, which is caused largely by an increase in the number of Glut 1 transporters at the plasma membrane (27Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. Mueckler M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). When 2-deoxyglucose uptake experiments were performed under identical conditions as described above but in the presence of 25 mmd-glucose and no glucosamine, uptake increased from 0.06 ± .008 to 0.77 ± 0.027, which is a 12.8-fold increase (data not shown). If cells are treated with increasing concentrations of glucosamine (glucose-free DMEM), 2-DOG uptake in the presence of insulin decreased dramatically (Fig. 1 A). Basal uptake also decreased but at higher glucosamine concentrations (>5 mm). The change in 2-DOG uptake with insulin (Δ-insulin) was plotted as a function of glucosamine concentration (Fig.1 B). The ED50 was 1.95 mm, which is between the values reported by Marshall et al. (5Marshall S. Bacote V. Traxinger R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4706-4712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for glucosamine treatment (5 h) of primary rat adipocytes performed in the absence (ED50 = 6.7 mm) and presence of insulin (ED50 = 0.36 mm). Glut 1 and Glut 4 transporters have been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane (PM) with insulin from a low density microsomal fraction (LDM) in both primary adipose cells (28Cushman S.W. Wardzala L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4758-4762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 3T3-L1 adipocytes (23Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subcellular fractionation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was carried out (see “Experimental Procedures”) after treating cells withd-glucose-free DMEM containing l-glucose alone or in the presence of 2, 5, and 20 mm glucosamine. The amounts of Glut 1 (Fig. 2 A) and Glut 4 (Fig. 2 B) in the plasma membrane for both basal and insulin-treated cells were determined by Western blot analysis. For control cells incubated in l-glucose DMEM (no glucosamine), the amount of Glut 1 transporter at the PM tended to increase with insulin (from 0.7 to 1.0) although it was not statistically significant. If cells were incubated in DMEM containing 25 mmd-glucose, Glut 1 content in the PM increased from 0.47 to 1.08 with insulin (data not shown). The observed increase in Glut 1 at the PM in the basal state under glucose starvation conditions is consistent with previously published data (27Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. Mueckler M. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and is also in agreement with the 2-DOG uptake results described above. Glut 4 increased in the PM approximately 2-fold (from ∼0.5 to 1.0) with insulin in cells incubated with glucosamine-free DMEM containing either l-glucose (Fig. 2 B) ord-glucose (data not shown). Glucosamine decreased insulin-stimulated translocation of both Glut 1 and Glut 4 to the plasma membrane. At 2 mm glucosamine, translocation of Glut 1 and Glut 4 with insulin was inhibited 80 and 70%, respectively, and translocation of both transporters was completely abolished at 20 mm glucosamine. The severity of the inhibition especially at 2 mm glucosamine was higher than one would have predicted based on the Δ-insulin uptake results (ED50 = 1.95 mm). The apparent inconsistency is probably due to the fact that the PM fractions were contaminated with other subcellular compartments that also contain each of the transporters, which masked the degree of insulin-activated translocation to the PM. Therefore, any translocation that we did observe in the presence of glucosamine was not statistically significant. Insulin-stimulated depletion of Glut 1 and Glut 4 from the LDM is shown in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively. In control cells (l-glucose DMEM) the amount of Glut 1 and Glut 4 in the LDM decreased with insulin from 1.0 to 0.43 and from 1.0 to 0.67, respectively. Glucosamine inhibited insulin-induced translocation from the LDM for both Glut 1 and Glut 4 in a concentration-dependent manner. At 2 mmglucosamine, only Glut 1 was statistically depleted from the LDM with insulin treatment. Interestingly, the absolute amount of Glut 4 in the LDM under basal conditions was significantly higher with glucosamine treatment compared with the control (l-glucose), suggesting that glucosamine caused a redistribution of Glut 4 to the LDM under basal conditions. A similar glucosamine-induced redistribution of Glut 4 to the LDM in the basal state was observed in primary rat adipocytes (29Filippis A. Clark S. Proietto J. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). The insulin signaling pathway was investigated to determine the mechanism by which glucosamine inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transporter translocation. Although the complete insulin pathway for translocation is still unclear, several of the initial steps have been identified in recent years (30Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 117-142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cascade is initiated by binding of insulin to specific cell surface receptors that then autophosphorylate critical tyrosine residues that activate an intrinsic tyrosine kinase. In fat cells, insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been shown to be important in the translocation of Glut 4 (31Quon M.J. Butte A.J. Zarnowski M.J. Sesti G. Cushman S.W. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27920-27924Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transmission of the insulin signal from the cell surface to the LDM appears to involve phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor at the PM (32Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and movement of tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 to the LDM, where it binds and activates PI 3-kinase to generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate lipids (33Kelly K.L. Ruderman N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4391-4398Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate lipids bind to and activate protein kinase B (AKT) kinase (34Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F. Tempst P. Coadwell J. Hawkins P.T. Science. 1998; 279: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar) that phosphorylates and activates AKT, which somehow causes vesicles containing Glut 4 to migrate to the cell surface (35Ueki K. Yamamoto-Honda R. Kaburagi Y. Yamauchi T. Tobe K. Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Komuro I. Akanuma Y. Yazaki Y. Kadowaki T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). We first investigated the autophosphorylation step of the insulin receptor by performing Western blot analyses on PM fractions using an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3). Insulin stimulated tyrosine autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor 20-fold in l-glucose control cells (Fig. 3 A). Glucosamine inhibited insulin-activated autophosphorylation dramatically in a concentration-dependent manner. Δ-Insulin autophosphorylation was reduced 52, 64, and 72% at 2, 5, and 20 mm glucosamine, respectively, compared withL-glucose controls. LDM fractions were then analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation to examine the phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor. Insulin stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation approximately 12-fold in control cells (Fig. 3 B). Glucosamine inhibited Δ-insulin tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 to approximately 50% of that observed in l-glucose controls when cells were treated with 2, 5, or 20 mm glucosamine. On the whole, insulin receptor autophosphorylation was more sensitive to glucosamine treatment than IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. This is consistent with the idea of a spare insulin receptor population. The next step in the cascade, IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity, was analyzed using LDM fractions from control and glucosamine-treated cells. LDM were solubilized with Nonidet P-40 and then immunoprecipitated with IRS-1 antibody. PI 3-kinase activity was measured in the immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase activity in control cells increased during the first 5 min after insulin addition to 8.4-fold basal activity and then dropped to 5-fold (Fig. 4 A). In glucosamine cells, the IRS-1-complexed PI 3-kinase activity was 30% of control after 2 min of insulin, 35% after 5 min of insulin, and 50% after 15 min of insulin. AKT activation by insulin was analyzed from AKT-1 immunoblots of cytosol from control and glucosamine-treated cells. Insulin causes an increase in serine and threonine phosphorylation of AKT, which shifts the migration of the protein to a higher molecular mass on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel (37Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). This shift was observed using control LDM but was absent with LDM from glucosamine-treated cells (Fig.4 B). The most likely interpretation of our signaling data is that glucosamine impaired insulin-stimulated translocation by inhibiting insulin receptor autophosphorylation, which would then progressively affect each subsequent step in the cascade."

Its O<sub>2</sub> binding is coupled to the structural/functional transition between T- (low affinity extreme) and R- (high affinity) states. This transition is linked to the reversible cleavage of the heme Fe-proximal His bonds in the α(Fe-NO) subunits and is sensitive to allosteric effectors, such as protons, 2,3-biphosphoglycerate, and inositol hexaphosphate. In fact, α(Fe-NO)<sub>2</sub>β(Fe)<sub>2</sub>is exceptionally sensitive to protons, as it exhibits a highly enhanced Bohr effect. The total Bohr effect of α-nitrosyl hemoglobin is comparable to that of normal hemoglobin, despite the fact that the oxygenation process involves only two ligation steps. All of these structural and functional evidences have been further confirmed by examining the reactivity of the sulfhydryl group of the Cys<sup>β93</sup> toward 4,4′-dipyridyl disulfide of several α-nitrosyl hemoglobin derivatives over a wide pH range, as a probe for quaternary structure. Despite the halved O<sub>2</sub>-carrying capacity, α-nitrosyl hemoglobin is fully functional (cooperative and allosterically sensitive) and could represent a versatile low affinity O<sub>2</sub> carrier with improved features that could deliver O<sub>2</sub> to tissues effectively even after NO is sequestered at the heme sites of the α-subunits. It is concluded that the NO bound to the heme sites of the α-subunits of hemoglobin acts as a negative allosteric effector of Hb and thus might play a role in O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> transport in the blood under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2154901227,"In various cell types certain stresses can stimulate p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), leading to the transcriptional activation of genes that contribute to appropriate compensatory responses. In this report the mechanism of p38-activated transcription was studied in cardiac myocytes where this MAPK is a key regulator of the cell growth and the cardiac-specific gene induction that occurs in response to potentially stressful stimuli. In the cardiac atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene, a promoter-proximal serum response element (SRE), which binds serum response factor (SRF), was shown to be critical for ANF induction in primary cardiac myocytes transfected with the selective p38 MAPK activator, MKK6 (Glu). This ANF SRE does not possess sequences typically required for the binding of the Ets-related ternary complex factors (TCFs), such as Elk-1, indicating that p38-mediated induction through this element may take place independently of such TCFs. Although p38 did not phosphorylate SRF in vitro, it efficiently phosphorylated ATF6, a newly discovered SRF-binding protein that is believed to serve as a co-activator of SRF-inducible transcription at SREs. Expression of an ATF6 antisense RNA blocked p38-mediated ANF induction through the ANF SRE. Moreover, when fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain, an N-terminal 273-amino acid fragment of ATF6 was sufficient to support trans-activation of Gal4/luciferase expression in response to p38 but not the other stress kinase, N-terminal Jun kinase (JNK); p38-activating cardiac growth promoters also stimulated ATF6 trans-activation. These results indicate that through ATF6, p38 can augment SRE-mediated transcription independently of Ets-related TCFs, representing a novel mechanism of SRF-dependent transcription by MAP kinases.

The c-fos SRE, which is comprised of a core sequence (CC(A/T)6GG) and a nearby Ets motif ((C/A)(C/A)GGA(A/T)), binds serum response factor (SRF) over the A/T-rich core sequence (2Norman C.

Biol. 1996; 6: 16-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For example, all three MAP kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), N-terminal jun kinase (JNK), and p38, phosphorylate the TCF, Elk-1, as part of the mechanism by which c-fos transcription is activated through the SRE (6Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S-H. Su M.S-S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Although SRF itself is phosphorylated as a result of the activation of certain signaling pathways (e.g. pp90rsk and Ca/CaMKIV; Refs. 7Miranti C.K. Ginty D.D. Huang G. Chatila T. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3672-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar and 8Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and this phosphorylation leads to increased c-fos transcription, there is no evidence that any of the MAP kinases can influence transcription by directly phosphorylating SRF. Accordingly, it is widely believed that MAP kinase-stimulated transcriptional induction through the c-fos SRE is dependent on Elk-1-, Sap-1-, or as yet unidentified TCFs. serum response element serum response factor ternary complex factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase: JNK, N-terminal Jun kinase atrial natriuretic factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay mitogen-activated protein kinase base pair(s). serum response element serum response factor ternary complex factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase: JNK, N-terminal Jun kinase atrial natriuretic factor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electrophoretic mobility shift assay mitogen-activated protein kinase base pair(s). In contrast to the c-fos promoter there are a number of genes that possess critical SREs which do not have flanking- or nearby Ets motifs and therefore are not likely to bind Ets-related TCFs (4Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar,9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ.

Marais R. Wynne J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4631-4640Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); among them are several cardiac-specific genes that are induced as part of the well studied hypertrophic growth program. For example, the skeletal α-actin (12MacLellan W.R. Lee T.C. Schwartz R.J. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16754-16760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Karns L.R. Kariya K. Simpson P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 410-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), cardiac α-actin (14Moss J.B. McQuinn T.C. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12731-12740Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) genes (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) all possess such SREs that are critical for induction by growth factors. Recent studies have shown that the p38 pathway plays an important role in conferring growth factor inducibility to these cardiac genes (15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross J. Brown H.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Accordingly, induction by p38 presumably involves the SREs that are required for growth factor-stimulated transcription. However, the only mechanism presently known by which p38 can activate transcription through SREs requires phosphorylation of Elk-1 by p38 (6Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S-H. Su M.S-S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unclear how p38 could enhance transcription through SREs in cardiac genes in an Ets/TCF-independent manner. To address this question we used the ANF gene in cardiac myocytes as a model system and asked first whether p38 pathway signals converge on the ANF SRE to confer inducibility and if so, through what mechanism. Primary ventricular myocytes, prepared from 1–4-day-old neonatal rats as described previously (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

The cultures were then washed briefly with medium, refed with serum-free, hormone-free DMEM containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, maintained for an additional 48 h and then extracted for reporter enzyme assays. After isolation, myocardial cells were resuspended at a density of 30 million cells/ml minimal medium (DMEM (Sigma) containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and transfections were carried out as described previously (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, for each transfection, 300 μl, or 9 million cells, were mixed with 15 to 30 μg of a reporter construct (e.g. ANF/Luc (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or pG5E1bLuc (1Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 18Raingeaud J.

The levels of plasmid used in each culture within an experiment were equalized using empty vector DNA, such as pCMV6. Each 300-μl aliquot was then electroporated in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 500 V, 25 microfarads, 100 Ω in a 0.2-cm gap cuvette, a protocol that allows for the selective transfection of only cardiac myocytes (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This procedure results in an approximate 30% viability (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); accordingly, the 3 million viable cells were plated into fibronectin-coated 35-mm wells. The ANF/luciferase reporter constructs used in this study include ANF 134 and ANF 65, which are composed of ANF (−134 to +65) or ANF (−65 to +65) driving luciferase expression, respectively. ANF 134 is inducible, while ANF 65 displays mostly basal promoter activity; both constructs display myocardial cell-specific expression (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The structures of ANF 65 (c-fos SRE), ANF 65 (ANF SRE), ANF 65 (M c-fos SRE), and ANF 65 (M ANF SRE) are described in Fig. 1. In each case the relevant synthetic oligonucleotide pairs (see below) were hybridized, ligated to form trimers, and cloned upstream of the minimal, cardiac-specific ANF promoter (ANF 65), as described previously (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Figure 1Mapping p38-inducible elements in the ANF promoter. Panel A, diagram of luciferase reporter constructs: the luciferase reporter constructs used to map the p38-inducible element(s) in the ANF 5′-flanking sequence are shown. Regions depicted as white bars represent native rat ANF promoter sequences and the SRE-like core region (SRE consensus = CC(A/T)6GG) is single underlined in each construct. 1) ANF 134 is comprised of rat ANF 5′-flanking sequences extending to −134 bp from the ANF transcriptional start site, defined as +1, fused to luciferase. In construct 2, ANF 134 (M ANF SRE), the positions shown in bold and lowercasewere mutated to distrupt the SRE core. Construct 3, ANF 65, is a truncated version of ANF 134, comprised of rat ANF promoter sequences extending to −65 bp from the ANF transcriptional start site fused to luciferase (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Construct 4, ANF 65 (ANF SRE), possesses ANF sequences from −125 to −102 (see construct 1), which contains the core ANF SRE and a small amount of flanking sequence, cloned as a 3 times concatomer in front of ANF 65. Construct 5, ANF 65 (c-fos SRE), has the c-fos SRE core and the same number of flanking nucleotides as ANF65 (ANF SRE) cloned as a 3 × concatomer in front of ANF 65; the Ets domain isdouble underlined. In construct 6, ANF 65 (M c-fos SRE), the Ets domain in construct 5 has been mutated (lowercase bold) so Elk will not bind, and in construct 7, ANF 65 (M ANF SRE), the SRE core in ANF 65 (ANF SRE) has been mutated to distrupt SRF binding. Constructs 4–7 all contain 3 × concatomers of the SRE-related sequences shown cloned in front of ANF 65/luciferase. At the bottom the ANF- and c-fosSREs are aligned for comparison purposes. Panel B, effects of MKK6 (Glu): the constructs diagrammed in Panel A, and SV40-β-galactosidase, were each co-transfected into primary myocardial cells ± MKK6 (Glu). After the 18-h cell plating period, the media were replaced with serum-free media and the MKK6 (Glu)-transfected cells were treated ± SB 203580 (5 μm) for 48 h, extracted and luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter assays carried out as described (9Sprenkle A.B.

Luciferase values were normalized with β-galactosidase values and plotted as relative luciferase compared with the control for each construct. Each value is the mean (n = 3) ± S.E.

Preliminary experiments using different concentrations of each construct verified that optimal doses were chosen. Transfected cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum for approximately 16 h after electroporation. The cells were then washed thoroughly and the medium was replaced with minimal medium. Unless otherwise stated, 24 to 48 h later the cultures were extracted for reporter enzyme assay. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed as described (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Luciferase activity was measured for 30 s on a Bio Orbit 1251 Luminometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Data are expressed as “Relative Luciferase (Rel Luc)” = arbitrary integrated luciferase units/β-gal units, representative of at least three independent experiments performed with two different plasmid preparations, and represent the mean and S.E. of triplicate cultures. The full-length cDNAs for human ATF6 (18Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell.

Olson, University of Texas, were subcloned into pcDNA3.1 and used as templates for in vitro transcription/translation using TNT® T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) ± [35S]Met, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The identities of the products were confirmed by observing the mobilities of the [35S]Met-labeled products after SDS-PAGE and by immunoprecipitating 35S-Met-labeled products with the anti-ATF6 (19Zhu C. Johansen F-E. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4957-4966Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) or anti-SRF (20Manak M.R. de Bisschop N. Kris R.M. Prywes R. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 955-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) antisera followed by SDS-PAGE. EMSA was performed as described (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. ANF SRE and MEF2C probes were prepared by T4 kinase end labeling of the relevant oligonucleotide pairs (see above). A typical binding assay contained 20,000 cpm of double-stranded probe and 5 to 10 μg of protein in 1 × binding buffer (30 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.2), 8% glycerol, 1 nmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm ZnCl2). After a 10-min preincubation of extract and 0.2 μg of nonspecific competitor (poly(dI-dC), Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and test competitor oligonucleotide pairs, as indicated, the probe was added. Binding was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 30 min prior to separation of bound and free probe on a 4% native polyacrylamide (PA) gel (29:1 bis/acrylamide) high ionic strength buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 8.5), 380 mm glycine, 2.1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were detected by autoradiography. The autoradiograms of some gels in this article were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer and the resulting image was imported to Adobe Photoshop and Claris MacDraw Pro II for final figure preparation. In vitro phosphorylation reactions with p38 and MAPKAP kinase-3 were carried out essentially as described previously (21Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 22Han J. Jian Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.J.

Han) or the active form of MAPKAP kinase-3 (obtained from Dr. Stephan Ludwig) were mixed with recombinant ATF6, MEF2C, or HSP27 (StressGen), in 30 μl of kinase buffer (21Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) and [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. Approximately 1 μl of antisera specific for the protein in question was then added to each reaction mixture and allowed to incubate for 4 h at 4 °C after which protein A-Sepharose beads were used to collect immune complexes, as described previously (15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were then eluted from the beads using Laemmli sample buffer and the eluted material analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by PhosphorImager analysis, as described in the legend to Fig. 3. In some cases, the recombinant proteins were prepared in the presence of [35S]methionine allowing them to be used as markers on parallel lanes of a gel. For ERK and JNK assays, cultures were treated for 30 min with control medium, or phenylephrine (10 μm), serum (10%), phorbol ester diburyate (100 nm), or endothelin-1 (10 nm), then extracted in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 1% Triton X-100, 0.05 mNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm sodiumo-vanadate, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin. After brief centrifugation, extracts to be tested for ERK activity were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-ERK (raised against the C-terminal 16 amino acids of ERK-1; Santa Cruz SC-093) bound to Protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia) and immune-complex kinase assays were carried out using the appropriate substrates, as described previously (8Rivera V.M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 868-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μg of myelin basic protein and 6 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothrietol, 20 μm ATP). After 30 min at 25 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer and the phosphorylation level of substrate proteins was evaluated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analyses. p38 assays were carried out as described previously (15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Briefly, after treating with test agent, myocardial cells (1.5 × 106 cells/35-mm culture well) were extracted in 80 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 1 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 100 μm sodium o-vanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Sixty-μl aliquots of each extract were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel followed by Western blotting using a p38 antibody specific for the phosphorylated/activated form of the kinase (specific for Thr(P)180/Tyr(P)182; New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly MA, catalog number NE 92115). In each experiment 3 identically treated cultures (1.5 × 106 cells/35 mm dish) were used for each treatment and following densitometric analyses of the exposed PhosphorImager plates, values for each treatment were averaged. To begin determining how the p38 MAPK pathway participates in cardiac gene induction, p38-inducible elements in the rat ANF promoter were mapped. Primary myocardial cells were co-transfected with ANF promoter/luciferase reporter plasmids (Fig.1 A) and a construct encoding MKK6 (Glu), an activated form a p38 MAP kinase kinase (18Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar, 21Han J. Lee J.D. Jiang Y. Li Z. Feng L. Ulevitch R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2886-2891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) which, among the MAPKs, activates only p38 in cardiac myocytes (15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Wang Y. Huang S. Sah V.P. Ross J. Brown H.H. Han J. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2161-2168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). In previous studies it has been shown that nearly all the information for optimal hormonal induction of ANF transcription resides in the 134-bp region just 5′ of the transcriptional start site (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Consistent with those results, transcription from a reporter construct comprised of the region spanning from −134 to +65 of the rat ANF 5′-flanking sequence was strongly induced (approximately 6-fold) by MKK6 (Glu) (Fig. 1 B, Construct 1), similar to levels previously seen using reporters comprised of 638 bp of ANF 5′-flanking sequence (15Zechner D. Thuerauf D.J. Hanford D.S. McDonough P.M. Glembotski C.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The induction of ANF 134 was completely blocked by SB 203580, a cell permeable compound shown to selectively inhibit p38 (26Cuenda A. Rouse J. Doza Y.N. Meier R. Cohen P. Gallagher T.F. Young P.R. Lee J.C. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1971) Google Scholar). Truncating ANF 134 by just 70 nt resulted in a construct, ANF 65, which had completely lost p38 inducibility (Fig. 1 B, Construct 3), indicating that p38-inducible sequences must lie between −134 and −65 in the ANF 5′-flanking sequence. An A/T-rich SRE, the core of which resides between −117 and −108 in ANF (Fig. 1 A), is highly conserved and found in the ANF genes of all species studied to date. This SRE was previously shown to mediate ANF induction in response to myocardial cell growth factors, such as α1-adrenergic agonists (9Sprenkle A.B. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether the ANF SRE participated in p38-mediated ANF 134 induction, a cluster mutation known to distrupt SRF binding to the ANF SRE was tested.

Both the prevalence of the disease and the often devastating consequences of these tumors pose a serious health and medical care problem. The disease has been mapped to two distinct genetic loci in humans, and although the genes (TSC1 andTSC2) for both loci have recently been cloned, their function remains an enigma. Data presented here demonstrates that TSC2 protein can bind and selectively modulate transcription mediated by members of the steroid receptor superfamily of genes. These data place TSC2 into a growing list of nuclear receptor coregulators and strengthen the expanding body of evidence that these coregulators may play critical roles in cellular differentiation.

Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar). The birth frequency has been estimated at approximately 1 in 6000 (2Osborne J.P. Fryer A. Webb D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 615: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Pathologically, TSC is classified as a disorder of cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The tumors associated with TSC are diagnostically distinct, very seldom progress to malignancy, but often have very devastating consequences. The most classical are those that occur in the brain, where they frequently cause epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and/or attention deficit disorders (1Gomez M.R. Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar, 3Kwiatkowski D.J. Short M.P. Arch. Dermatol. 1994; 130: 348-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The relatively high prevalence and serious consequences of TSC make it an important health concern both here in the United States and throughout the world.TSC has been genetically linked to two loci in humans (4Povey S. Burley M.W. Attwood J. Benham F. Hunt D. Jeremiah S.J. Franklin D. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1994; 58: 107-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). About 60% of TSC cases are sporadic, but in families it has autodominant inheritance with high penetrance. TSC was first linked to chromosome 9q34 in 1987 (5Fryer A.E. Chalmers A.H. Conner J.M. Fraser I. Povey S. Yates A.D. Yates J.R. Osborne J.P. Lancet. 1987; i: 659-661Abstract Scopus (318) Google Scholar), and this locus was termed TSC1. Later studies identified a second locus on chromosome 16p13 (6Kandt R.S. Haines J.L. Smith M. Northrup H. Gardner R.J. Short M.P. Dumars K. Roach E.S. Steingold S. Wall S. et al.Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 37-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) that was called TSC2. The focal nature of TSC tumors suggests thatTSC1 and TSC2 may function as tumor suppressor genes, and this is further supported by evidence for inactivatingTSC2 germ line mutations and loss of heterozygosity at theTSC2 locus in TSC-associated tumors.The genes for both TSC1 and TSC2 have recently been cloned. Both were cloned by consortiums of investigators sequencing the specific regions of chromosome 9 (7Consortium T.T. Science. 1997; 277: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar) and chromosome 16 (8Consortium E.T.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) to which TSC1 and TSC2 had been mapped, respectively. TSC1, or hemartin as it was named by the authors, encodes a cDNA of 8599 base pairs containing a 1164-amino acid open reading frame. TSC2, or tuberin, also encodes a rather large protein of 198 kilodaltons as specified by a cDNA of 5474 base pairs containing a 1784-amino acid open reading frame. The lack of any obvious structural similarities between TSC1 and TSC2 would suggest their relationship to tuberous sclerosis is either through some functional homology or through some converging function.Very little is known about the function of TSC1. The large TSC2 protein appears fairly inert, with a small leucine zipper domain at the amino end of the protein and a region of homology to Rap1 GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain at the carboxyl end. Two groups have recently used regions containing the GAP domain as bait in yeast two-hybrid screens in an effort to establish a functional relevance for it. Xiao et al. (9Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) identified a protein, rabaptin-5, that could bind TSC2 and stimulate hydrolysis of Rab5. Their conclusion was that TSC2 functions as a Rab5GAP, which could negatively regulate Rab5-GTP activity in endocytosis. In a second yeast two-hybrid study, Tsuchiya et al. (10Tsuchiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar), using a similar region of the carboxyl terminus of TSC2, found this region to contain transcriptional activation domains within it. These authors went on to characterize two transcriptional activation domains in the carboxyl terminus of TSC2 but are unable to clearly demonstrate an association of TSC2 with DNA or even a strong association with the nucleus of transfected cells. Together these studies suggested TSC2 may be an integral component of some signal transduction pathway, and defining that pathway might be critical to understanding TSC2's role in TSC.In the present study, a cDNA for TSC2 was serendipitously cloned as a modulator of transcription events mediated by the retinoid X receptor (RXR). Evidence is further presented for TSC2 interaction with and modulation of several steroid receptor family members. These data suggest a possible avenue for TSC regulation of cellular differentiation and perhaps a mechanism for tuberous sclerosis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStudies in our laboratory have centered around analysis of steroid receptor transcription and, more specifically, transcription mediated by nuclear receptors that appear to require heterodimerization with members of the retinoid X (RXR) family of receptors (11Henry K. O'Brien M.L. Clevenger W. Jow L. Noonan D.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 132: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 15Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). In the early 1990s several laboratories demonstrated the activation of a variety of these nuclear receptors, including those activated by all-trans-retinoic acid (RAR), vitamin D (VDR), thyroid hormone (TR), and peroxisome proliferators (PPAR), was contingent upon, heterodimerization with members of the RXR family (15Kliewer S.A.

The RXR family of receptors has been shown to be involved in a variety of cell regulatory and differentiation events (24Mangelsdorf D.J. Borgmeyer U. Heyman R.A. Zhou J.Y. Ong E.S. Oro A.E. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 329-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar, 25Kastner P. Grondona J.M. Mark M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Decimo D. Vonesch J.L., P., D. Chambon P. Cell. 1994; 78: 987-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 26Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The importance of RXR in nuclear receptor signaling pathways is best demonstrated by their prerequisite role in the yeast-based in vitro transcription assay (11Henry K. O'Brien M.L. Clevenger W. Jow L. Noonan D.J. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1995; 132: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Allegretto E.A. McClurg M.R. Lazarchik S.B. Clemm D.L. Kerner S.A. Elgort M.G. Boehm M.F. White S.K. Pike J.W. Heyman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26625-26633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As opposed to the mammalian cell in vitrotranscription assay, wherein RXR is endogenously expressed, in the steroid receptor null background of yeast, RXR heterodimer partners are virtually inactive unless supplied with a RXR family member. Interestingly, most heterodimer partners examined thus far in this yeast assay are also constitutively active in the presence of RXR and function independent of the addition of exogenous ligand. These data would suggest that mammalian systems contain unique regulatory proteins that mediate ligand dependence and/or transcriptional activation.Although the findings in yeast limit their use in studying physiologically relevant questions, we investigated the potential of this system for cloning RXR heterodimer partners. Prototrophic yeast carrying an expression plasmid for human RXRα and a β-galactosidase reporter plasmid driven by a classical DR-5 RXR response element motif were transfected with a rat brain cDNA library cloned into a yeast expression vector. The presence of unique selectable markers on each plasmid vector permitted appropriate selection in yeast, and plating of the library onto yeast minimal medium plates containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-o-galactopyranoside, a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase, permitted selection of those cDNAs capable of turning on the transcription of the β-galactosidase gene. Plates were analyzed for the presence of β-galactosidase activity, and an initial screening of 150,000 transformants yielded 10 positive colonies from which plasmid DNA was rescued and partial cDNA sequence information was obtained. Sequence data were analyzed for homology to known genes using standard National Center for Biotechnology Information Entrez BLAST search programs, and several of the sequences revealed matches to previously described genes. To our surprise, DNA sequence analysis and homology search data suggested that none of these proteins were members of the steroid receptor superfamily. The most interesting of these were three genes that showed greater than 95% homology to portions of previously described genes, all of which have been implicated in some way or another in differentiation or carcinogenesis events. The closest any came to a transcription factor was clone pADcRB-1, which demonstrated 98% homology to the recently published sequence for ratTSC2 (Fig. 1). The pADcRB-1 clone expressed complete identity with the last 44 amino acids of the carboxyl end of the rat TSC2 protein. This region was homologous to one previously reported as containing transcriptional activation potential (10Tsuchiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar), although the exact mechanism or significance of this observation was unclear.These data suggest TSC2 may directly interact with RXR in mediating transcription. To examine this possibility, a full-lengthTSC2 clone was used to determine the influence of TSC2 protein on transcription mediated by several steroid receptor family members. Glucocorticoid receptor, a ligand-dependent homodimerizing receptor, as well as the RXR heterodimerizing nuclear receptors PPAR and VDR, were analyzed in mammalian cotransfection assays (Fig. 2). The TSC2gene, subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, was cotransfected into the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, along with various steroid receptor family members. Transfections were subsequently analyzed for effects on ligand-stimulated transcription of a receptor-specific luciferase reporter construct. The cotransfection of theTSC2 construct appeared to affect all receptors examined in either a positive or negative manner. The PPARα and VDR were up-regulated by 3.5- and 2.1-fold, respectively. Conversely, Glucocorticoid receptor-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited (47%) by the presence of TSC2. The relative merit of these findings is underscored by the observation that the reported values should be considered conservative figures if efficiencies of uniformly cotransfecting three plasmids (receptor, reporter, and TSC2)versus two plasmids (receptor and reporter) are taken into consideration.Figure 2Effects of TSC2 on steroid receptor-mediated transcription. In vitro cotransfection assays were performed using the HepG2 cell line. Mammalian expression vectors pRSV-rPPARα, pRSV-hGR, or pRSV-hVDR were cotransfected with luciferase reporter vectors pBL-AOXRE-Luc (pRSV-rPPARα), pBL-MMTV-Luc (pRSV-hGR), or pBL-VDRE-Luc (pRSV-hVDR) and with or without a pRSV-TSC2 mammalian expression construct. Respective ligands are as indicated and were used at the most efficacious concentration previously established for these receptor/reporter combinations. No receptor controls (NULL) for respective receptor constructs are as indicated. A β-galactosidase expression plasmid was included in all transfections, and activity is expressed as the average of triplicate luciferase activities normalized to their respective β-galactosidase activity. Data represent triplicate points ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These data suggest TSC2 is directly influencing transcription mediated by steroid receptor family members. To explore the logical possibility that TSC2 is mediating its effects through direct associations with receptors, TSC2 was initially examined for its effects on receptor-DNA complex formation in gel mobility shift assays. The results from these studies were somewhat inconclusive. Although TSC2 did not bind DNA directly and did not appear to directly change the mobility of the shift complexes, it often distinguishably changed the amount of shiftable complex. This is illustrated for the ligand-dependent homodimer RXRα complex and the ligand-independent heterodimer RXRα·RARα complex (Fig.3 A). Both complexes, generated by mixing yeast expressed receptor proteins with a32P-labeled DR5 response element motif derived from the promoter of the RARβ gene, are substantially enhanced by the presence of yeast-expressed pADcRB-1 protein, but lack any significant change in mobility.Figure 3Direct associations of TSC2 with nuclear receptors. A, yeast-expressed pADcRB-1 protein was analyzed for its ability to bind RXR homodimers or RXR/RAR heterodimers in a gel mobility shift assay. Nuclear extracts containing recombinant protein generated by expression of YEpADcRB1, YEphRXRα, and YEphRARα in BJ3505 yeast were mixed with a 32P-labeled DR-5 oligonucleotide and, where indicated, 10−6m 9-cis- retinoic acid. Complexes were separated by nondenaturing electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. B, TSC2 pull-down assays with baculovirus expressed recombinant hRXRα and hVDR protein. A cDNA sequence encoding the carboxyl 660 amino acids of the TSC2 protein was fused to GST in a pGEX bacterial expression vector. GST-TSC2 protein was purified on glutathione-agarose and glutathione-agarose-bound GST-TSC2 (lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6) or glutathione-agarose-bound GST (lanes 2 and 5) were incubated with extracts of Sf9 cells infected with wild type baculovirus (lanes 1 and 4), baculovirus expressing recombinant hRXRα (lanes 2 and 3), or baculovirus expressing recombinant hVDR (lanes 5 and 6). Bound proteins were analyzed in a Western blot using antisera specific for RXRα (lanes 1–3) or VDR (lanes 4–6). Controllanes 7 and 8, identifying the baculovirus expressed receptor proteins, include the baculovirus extracts Western blotted from the same gel and probed with their respective antisera. Specific locations for RXRα and VDR proteins are as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)One reasonable explanation for these data would be that TSC2 was binding receptors and, in effect, recruiting them to the response element, but the TSC2-receptor interactions were not strong enough to withstand the electrophoresis process. In an attempt to address this possibility the somewhat milder receptor pull-down assay was tried. A 660-amino acid encoding cDNA fragment from the carboxyl terminus of the human TSC2 gene was subcloned into a pGEX bacterial expression vector. A GST-TSC2 fusion protein was generated inEscherichia coli and purified using glutathione-agarose (GA). GA-bound GST-TSC2 and GA-bound GST were mixed with baculovirus extract expressing either a recombinant RXRα protein, a recombinant VDR protein, or native extract. Unbound material was washed away, and bound material was electrophoresed and analyzed in Western blots by probing with antisera to the respective receptors (Fig. 3 B). In this assay, TSC2 appears to definitively pull down receptor protein, demonstrating that these receptors are capable of directly interacting with TSC2 protein.These data, coupled with the transcription data, suggest TSC2 might be directly bridging receptors with basal transcription machinery, serving as some type of scaffold for receptors and other basal machinery transcription factors. Over the past 4 years a variety of putative steroid receptor coregulators have been cloned and characterized (28Halachmi S. Marden E. Martin G. MacKay H. Abbondanza C. Brown M. Eng L.

The majority of these were cloned using steroid receptor ligand binding domains as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay and, unlike TSC2, are generally found to be universally repressors or activators of steroid receptor-mediated transcription. The functional significance of these proteins has recently been demonstrated in a series of articles ascribing a chromatin remodeling function through interactions with acetylases and deacetylases, enzymes responsible for attaching and removing acetyl groups from histones. Furthermore, several of these proteins have also been shown to complex with other transcriptional repressors as well as the transcription scaffolding protein Sin3 (40Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D., R., D.J. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Of possible relevance here is the observation that these interactions directly affect a mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC1), which has been implicated in cell cycle and differentiation events (43Hassig C.A.

Sauter G. Kallioniemi O. Trent J.M. Meltzer P.S. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1421) Google Scholar) reported the direct correlation of breast and ovarian cancer with the overexpression of AIB1, a member of the SRC-1 family of steroid receptor coregulators. These coregulators, similar to what was seen here for TSC2 with PPAR and VDR, enhance ligand-dependent transcription. It is attractive to hypothesize that TSC2, and perhaps TSC1, function in a similar manner and therefore serve as important regulators of cellular differentiation in a variety of steroid receptor-sensitive tissues. This would be especially relevant for the RXR and RAR members, whose expression has been directly correlated with cellular differentiation events and whose tissue distribution closely resembles that of TSC2 and TSC1 (7Consortium T.T. Science. 1997; 277: 805-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar, 8Consortium E.T.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 24Mangelsdorf D.J.

Ongoing studies are currently directed at establishing the associations between TSC2, basal transcription machinery, and histone acetylation.Alternatively, the available data do not completely eliminate a role for TSC2 in nuclear transport or cytoplasmic signaling events. Circumstantial data supporting a role for TSC2 in nuclear transport include: 1) cytological staining evidence that demonstrates a localization of TSC2 to the perinuclear spaces (10Tsuchiya H. Orimoto K. Kobayashi K. Hino O. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 429-433PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) the presence of a Rap1GAP- and/or Rab5GAP-like domain in the carboxyl end of the TSC2 protein (8Consortium E.T.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1305-1315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar, 9Xiao G.H. Shoarinejad F. Jin F. Golemis E.A. Yeung R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6097-6100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although these specific G-proteins are not thought to be involved with nuclear transport, the strength of the activity studies for these proteins is not overly convincing. What the data do support is the presence of a GAP activity associated with TSC2, and it has been clearly demonstrated that at least one small GTPase (Ran) is associated with nuclear transport (48Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 49Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Finally, nuclear receptor activity has also been correlated with a variety of intracellular signaling events (50Housley P.R.

The majority of these incorporate specific phosphorylation events, which ultimately facilitate either the activation or repression of nuclear receptor-mediated transcription. A more discriminating and thorough examination of TSC2 associations with cytosolic and nuclear structures may be highly informative with respect to what exactly TSC2 is doing in the cell.In summary, the above data for the first time assign a functional correlation between TSC2 and steroid receptor coactivation. These data offer a hypothetical mechanism for TSC2 effects on differentiation and a pathway for hemartoma development during critical cellular differentiation events. It is known that disruption of RXR-mediated signaling pathways critically affect embryonic survival and development (25Kastner P. Grondona J.M. Mark M. Gansmuller A. LeMeur M. Decimo D. Vonesch J.L., P., D. Chambon P. Cell. 1994; 78: 987-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 26Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and the data presented here suggest that TSC2 could be involved in modulation of these pathways. This modulation event could conceptually result in tissue-specific ligand-dependent growth abnormalities that would not be expressed as a transformed phenotype but rather as benign outgrowths whose growth and development are constrained by natural hormone and gene expression events dictated by development. Future evaluations of TSC1's association with cell signaling events, and particularly RXR-mediated transcription, may help to clarify the accuracy of the hypothesis.

Gomez M.R. Tuberous Sclerosis. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1988Google Scholar). The birth frequency has been estimated at approximately 1 in 6000 (2Osborne J.P. Fryer A. Webb D. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 615: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Pathologically, TSC is classified as a disorder of cellular migration, proliferation, and differentiation. The tumors associated with TSC are diagnostically distinct, very seldom progress to malignancy, but often have very devastating consequences. The most classical are those that occur in the brain, where they frequently cause epilepsy, mental retardation, autism, and/or attention deficit disorders (1Gomez M.R. Gomez M.R.

https://openalex.org/W1983401747,"Although the β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) mediates agonist-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors, recent studies suggest additional cellular functions. During our attempts to identify novel βARK interacting proteins, we found that the cytoskeletal protein tubulin could specifically bind to a βARK-coupled affinity column. In vitro analysis demonstrated that βARK and G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 (GRK5) were able to stoichiometrically phosphorylate purified tubulin dimers with a preference for β-tubulin and, under certain conditions, the βIII-isotype. Examination of the GRK/tubulin binding characteristics revealed that tubulin dimers and assembled microtubules bind GRKs, whereas the catalytic domain of βARK contains the primary tubulin binding determinants. In vivo interaction of GRK and tubulin was suggested by the following: (i) co-purification of βARK with tubulin from brain tissue; (ii) co-immunoprecipitation of βARK and tubulin from COS-1 cells; and (iii) co-localization of βARK and GRK5 with microtubule structures in COS-1 cells. In addition, GRK-phosphorylated tubulin was found preferentially associated with the microtubule fraction during in vitro assembly assays suggesting potential functional significance. These results suggest a novel link between the cytoskeleton and GRKs that may be important for regulating GRK and/or tubulin function.

These results suggest a novel link between the cytoskeleton and GRKs that may be important for regulating GRK and/or tubulin function. Tubulin, along with a variety of associated proteins, constitute microtubules, a major component of the cytoskeleton. Tubulin exists principally in two forms, as either cytosolic soluble tubulin heterodimers consisting of various α- and β-tubulin isotypes or as insoluble assembled tubulin polymers (microtubules) (1Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ability of tubulin to cycle between these two states is one of its most fundamentally important features. In cells, microtubules are involved in such diverse and dynamic functions as maintaining cell shape, endocytosis, exocytosis, vesicle trafficking, cellular transport, and mitosis (1Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These dynamic functions require the coordinated regulation of microtubule function and assembly, a process thought to reflect integration of various extracellular signals (2Jessell T.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 3-13Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Indeed, many studies have revealed functional relationships between tubulin and various cellular signaling molecules. For example, tyrosine kinases such as the insulin receptor and c-Src, as well as second messenger-responsive kinases such as the cAMP-dependent and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinases, can regulate microtubule function and/or assembly through phosphorylation (Ref. 3MacRae T.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 265-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholarand references therein). Moreover, a series of recent studies have demonstrated direct binding interactions between Gα and Gβγ subunits and tubulin (4Wang N. Yan K. Rasenick M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1239-1242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Roychowdhury S. Rasenick M.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9800-9805Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 6Roychowdhury S.

Other studies provide examples of tubulin or microtubules regulating either the activity or the localization of signaling molecules such as the A1 adenosine (7Saunders C. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19035-19045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and γ-aminobutyric acid (8Whatley V.J. Mihic S.J. Allan A.M. McQuilkin S.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol.

Taken together, these studies provide support for a novel paradigm whereby information flow appears to be bi-directional between signaling and cytoskeletal molecules. β-Adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK) 1The abbreviations used are: βARKβ-adrenergic receptor kinaseGRK5G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisGSTglutathioneS-transferaseHAhemagglutininPPTPartially purified tubulinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acidPBSphosphate-buffered saline. is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) that includes rhodopsin kinase (GRK1), βARK (GRK2), βARK2 (GRK3), GRK4, GRK5, and GRK6. GRKs phosphorylate the agonist-activated form of G protein-coupled receptors which in turn promotes the high affinity binding of a second family of proteins, called arrestins (11Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). This process functions to both uncouple the G protein from the receptor and to promote receptor endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits. βARK is one of the best characterized GRKs and has been shown to be important for the phosphorylation and desensitization of a variety of receptors (11Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar). Moreover, βARK activity appears to be regulated through interactions with both free heterotrimeric Gβγ subunits (12Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L.

These interactions are thought to be important largely for their ability to promote translocation of βARK to the plasma membrane, facilitating interaction with receptor substrates. Recent studies have provided novel information regarding the function and cellular localization of βARK. Specifically, it was shown that βARK can traffic along with β2-adrenergic receptors to the endosome following receptor activation (17Ruiz-Gomez A. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9601-9604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Mayor and co-workers (18Murga C. Ruiz-Gomez A. Garcia-Higuera I. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. Mayor Jr., F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 985-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated an association of βARK with microsomes that appears to be mediated via an unidentified βARK-binding protein. Furthermore, βARK has been implicated to function in developmental processes involved in cardiogenesis through currently undefined mechanisms (19Jaber M. Koch W. Rockman H. Smith B. Bond R.A. Sulik K.K. Ross Jr., J. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Giros B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12974-12979Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Given these and other areas of inquiry, it seems likely that additional cellular substrates and regulators of βARK exist. Thus, in this study a biochemical approach was employed to explore this possibility. We describe here the identification of tubulin as a novel GRK substrate and present biochemical and cellular characterization of GRK/tubulin interaction. β-adrenergic receptor kinase G protein-coupled receptor kinase-5 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathioneS-transferase hemagglutinin Partially purified tubulin 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline.

Partially purified tubulin (PPT) containing microtubule-associated proteins was prepared from porcine brain by one to three cycles of temperature-dependent microtubule assembly/disassembly as described previously (6Roychowdhury S.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed using standard methods (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. The membrane was then incubated in blocking buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20, and 5% non-fat dried milk) at 22 °C for 1 h followed by probing with either an α-tubulin-, βARK-, GRK5-, or arrestin-specific primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer. Membranes were subsequently probed with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 20–60 min at 22 °C. All blots were developed by ECL following the manufacturer's guidelines. 50 ml of Affi-Prep 10 affinity chromatography matrix (20% v/v) was incubated with or without βARK at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100 for 5 h for 4 °C. The coupling reaction was stopped by addition of 5 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and incubation overnight at 4 °C. A trace amount of [35S]methionine-labeled βARK was included in the initial coupling reaction to enable a determination of coupling efficiency (∼1 mg βARK/ml resin). The resin was then washed extensively with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 200 mmNaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.02% Triton X-100 and stored at 4 °C. Fresh bovine calf brain was stripped of connective tissue and minced in 200 ml of homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mmbenzamidine, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.02% Triton X-100) using a Brinkman Polytron (14,000 rpm, 30 s). The homogenate was centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min and the resulting supernatant at 300,000 × g for 60 min. The final supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until use. One ml of βARK-coupled affinity resin (20% v/v) or control resin was incubated with 10 ml of the soluble brain extract (or buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C. The incubation mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was washed four times with buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100). Bound proteins were released from the matrix by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer and 100 μl of water to the final pellet followed by boiling for 10 min. The samples were then subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. A specific 55-kDa protein band was identified by Ponceau S staining, excised, and then submitted to the Harvard Microchemistry Facility for sequence analysis. Phosphorylation reactions contained, in a total reaction volume of 20–50 μl, 0.025–0.2 μmβARK, GRK5, or rhodopsin kinase, 0.025–8 μm purified tubulin dimers, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.0–7.5 cpm/fmol), 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 7.5 mm MgCl2 in the absence or presence of 0.2 μmGβ1γ2 and phosphatidylcholine (20 μg)-dodecylmaltoside (10 mm) mixed micelles (16Onorato J.J.

Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5–90 min, stopped with SDS sample buffer, and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. After autoradiography, the 32P-labeled tubulin bands were excised and counted to determine the picomoles of phosphate transferred. Phosphorylation reactions were performed as above using either 0.025 or 2.5 μm βARK or GRK5 and 4.5 μm tubulin dimers in a total volume of 20 μl at 30 °C for 15 min. Phosphorylated tubulin was then reduced and carboxymethylated essentially as described previously (25Crestfield A.M. Moore S. Stein W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 622-627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 5 mm EDTA, 8m urea, and 120 mm β-mercaptoethanol was added to each phosphorylation reaction in a final volume of 100 μl and incubated under nitrogen at 22 °C for 2 h. 250 mg/ml iodoacetic acid, dissolved in 1 n NaOH, was then diluted 1:10 into the reduced tubulin solutions and incubated at 22 °C in the dark for 30 min. Reactions were stopped with SDS sample buffer, boiled, and subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and autoradiography. Purified GST-βARK fusion proteins containing either the N-terminal domain (residues 1–184), the central catalytic domain (residues 185–467), or the C-terminal domain (residues 466–689) of βARK were generated essentially as described previously (26Koch W.J. Inglese J. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8256-8260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ten μg of GST or GST-βARK fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with 0.4 μg of soluble tubulin dimers in 100 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.02% Triton X-100) at 30 °C for 60 min. Reactions were then chilled on ice for 5 min followed by precipitation in a microcentrifuge for 10 s. The pellet was washed three times with 400 μl of binding buffer and then boiled with SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using a monoclonal α-tubulin-specific antibody. Tubulin assembly reactions contained, in a total volume of 50 μl, 60 μg of tubulin (or control buffer), 1 mm GTP, 30% glycerol, and 10 μm Taxol in 100 mmPIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmMgCl2. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by pelleting at 150,000 × g for 10 min at 37 °C. The supernatant was removed and the Taxol-stable microtubule pellets were gently resuspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer (100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 7.5 mmMgCl2, 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 cpm/fmol), 1 μm Taxol) in the absence or presence of 5 μg of βARK or GRK5 and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Tubulin was then repelleted, and both the supernatant and pellet fractions were boiled with SDS sample buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and densitometry. After autoradiography, the32P-labeled tubulin bands were excised and counted to determine the picomoles of phosphate transferred. COS-1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Cells grown to 75–95% confluence were transfected with 10 μg of either pcDNA3, pcDNA3-βARK, pBC12BI, or pBC-GRK5 DNA using 65 μl of LipofectAMINETM per T75 flask according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were harvested 60 h after transfection. For immunofluorescence experiments, cells were trypsinized and plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips in a 24-well dish 2 h after transfection and analyzed at 24–36 h after transfection. COS-1 cells were transfected either with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-βARK as described above. At 60 h after transfection, T75 flasks were rinsed with PBS, and the cells were scraped into 1 ml of extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin) and lysed by freeze-thaw at −70 °C. Lysates were then centrifuged at 55,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 100 μl of lysate was incubated with either a βARK- or HA-specific polyclonal antibody or in the absence of antibody for 30 min at 4 °C followed by addition of 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in extraction buffer and an additional 60 min incubation at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 30 s in a microcentrifuge. The pellet was washed three times with extraction buffer for 30 min at 4 °C and then eluted in 50 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using either βARK-specific or α-tubulin-specific monoclonal antibodies. Transfected COS-1 cells grown on glass coverslips were rinsed twice with PBS at 37 °C and fixed with methanol at −20 °C for 10 min. Alternatively, some cells were preincubated with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 μm (−)-isoproterenol for either 20 or 60 min at 37 °C prior to fixing. Fixed cells were subsequently rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22 °C. These cells were blocked for 30 min at 37 °C with PBS containing 0.05% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton) and 5% non-fat dried milk and subsequently incubated with an α-tubulin-specific mouse monoclonal antibody and either a βARK-, GRK5-, or arrestin-3-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody diluted in the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS/Triton and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with a tetramethylrhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody both diluted 1:100 in PBS/Triton and 5% non-fat dried milk for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed five times with PBS/Triton and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min followed by fixing with methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Cells were rinsed with PBS and mounted on a slide with SlowfadeTM mounting medium. Fluorescence microscopy was performed on a Bio-Rad MRC600 laser scanning confocal microscope (Hemmelholsteadt, UK) attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope, using a Zeiss Plan-Apo 63 × 1.40 NA oil immersion objective at a zoom factor of 1.4. Purified tubulin dimers were subjected to a 10 min pre-spin at 150,000 ×g at 4 °C to precipitate any existing tubulin aggregates. The supernatant was removed and utilized in the subsequent phosphorylation assay. Phosphorylation reactions (40 μl total) were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min and contained 60 μg of tubulin dimers, 200 μm GTP, 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, and 3 mm MgCl2, in the absence or presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (5 cpm/fmol) and either 4 μg of βARK or GRK5. Assembly of phosphorylated or control tubulin was initiated by the addition of glycerol (5–30% final concentration) and raising the temperature to 37 °C for 5–60 min. Assembly was quantitated by pelleting the microtubules at 150,000 × g for 10 min at 37 °C. The supernatant and pellet fractions were then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and densitometry. Distribution of the 32P-labeled tubulin was assessed by autoradiography, followed by excision and counting of the radiolabeled bands. In an effort to identify novel GRK-interacting proteins, a crude bovine brain cytosolic extract was chromatographed over a βARK affinity column. The column was washed extensively, and bound proteins were eluted with boiling SDS sample buffer and subsequently subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. This strategy identified a total of six proteins that specifically bound to the βARK column (Fig.1). The predominant interacting protein migrated at ∼55 kDa, and additional proteins of ∼50, ∼46, ∼44, ∼38, and ∼35 kDa were also observed. Since βARK is known to bind Gβγ subunits, we initially probed this blot using a βcommon antibody. This revealed that the ∼35-kDa protein was a Gβ subunit (data not shown). In an effort to identify the 55-kDa protein, it was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and subjected to tryptic digestion and sequence analysis. Two tryptic peptides were sequenced (AFVHXYVGEGMEEGEFSXAR and SGPFGQIFRPDNFVFGQSGAGNN). A data base search revealed that the first peptide is 100% conserved with human α4-, mouse α3- and α6-, and chicken α1-, α3-, α5-, and α8-tubulin isotypes and corresponds to a highly conserved region in α-tubulin (residues 404–423 in human α4). The second peptide is 100% conserved with several class I (βI) (human β1, mouse β5, and chicken β7), class II (βII) (human β2, chicken β1 and β2, rat β1, and pig βA), class III (βIII) (pig βB), and class IVa (βIVa) (human β5) β-tubulin isotypes (residues 79–101 of human β1-tubulin). Although bovine tubulin sequences remain relatively poorly characterized, based on these two peptides and their alignment with known tubulin sequences, the 55-kDa protein has been unambiguously identified as tubulin although the specific α- and β-tubulin isotypes present remains unclear. Importantly, tubulin is known for its ability to cycle between soluble αβ dimers and insoluble assembled microtubules (1Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Cell Motility and the Cytoskeleton. 1992; 22: 235-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and it is of interest to consider which form is responsible for the observed βARK binding. Although this was not assessed directly, the temperature and buffering conditions used to generate the brain extract, as well as those used in the binding experiment, inhibit tubulin assembly. Thus, it is likely that the tubulin was principally in the soluble form implying that βARK can bind soluble tubulin dimers. The βARK/tubulin interaction was confirmed by the ability of purified βARK to rapidly phosphorylate highly purified bovine brain soluble tubulin dimers to a stoichiometry of ∼1.0 mol of Pi/mol of tubulin dimer (Fig. 2). Addition of βARK activators such as Gβ1γ2 or phosphatidylcholine-dodecylmaltoside mixed micelles increased the stoichiometry to ∼1.5 and ∼1.6 mol/mol, respectively, or to ∼2.0 mol/mol when added together. Addition of 10 mmdodecylmaltoside alone, however, was without effect (data not shown). We also investigated the ability of tubulin to serve as a substrate for other members of the GRK family (Fig. 2). Rhodopsin kinase weakly phosphorylated tubulin (stoichiometry of ∼0.45 mol of Pi/mol of tubulin dimer), whereas GRK5 rapidly phosphorylated tubulin to a stoichiometry of ∼1.6 mol/mol. Interestingly, whereas both GRK5 and βARK appear capable of phosphorylating at least two sites on the tubulin dimer, there are apparent differences in the nature of this phosphorylation as demonstrated by a lower mobility phosphorylated species generated in the presence of GRK5 that is not observed in the presence of βARK (Fig. 2 A). This difference suggests specificity in the molecular nature of the GRK/tubulin interaction and allows the potential for functional differences to be attributed to each of these phosphorylation reactions. In order to identify which tubulin isotypes (α or β) are substrates for GRKs, tubulin was initially phosphorylated by either βARK or GRK5 and then carboxymethylated. Tubulin α- and β-isotypes are differentially susceptible to carboxymethylation allowing for their electrophoretic separation (27Khan I.A. Ludueña R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3704-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, among the various β-isotypes, βIII has a distinct susceptibility to carboxymethylation that resolves it from both the α- and other β-isotypes (β*) (27Khan I.A. Ludueña R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3704-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), as seen in the Coomassie Blue-stained lanes in Fig. 3. Phosphorylation of tubulin by 0.025 μm kinase for 15 min resulted in a preferential phosphorylation of β-tubulin isotypes by both βARK and GRK5 (Fig.3). Interestingly, at higher GRK levels (2.5 μm kinase), a qualitative difference in the phosphorylation selectivity was observed with βARK and particularly GRK5, both exhibiting a preference for the βIII-isotype (even though βIII represents only ∼25% of the total β-tubulin (28Banerjee A. Roach M.C. Wall K.A. Lopata M.A. Cleveland D.W. Ludueña R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3029-3034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Although we have not more thoroughly investigated the molecular basis of this apparent switch in isotype specificity, it is possible that the formation of GRK-tubulin hetero-oligomers at higher GRK concentrations contributes to this process. Total cellular concentrations of βARK and GRK5 were estimated to be in the range of 0.01–0.2 μm based on Western analysis of several cell lines (data not shown). Thus, while 2.5 μm kinase may not seem physiological it is likely that GRKs can exist in much higher local concentrations in various cellular micro-domains (e.g. at the plasma membrane/cytoskeleton interface), suggesting that both concentrations of GRK used in this experiment may be physiologically relevant. The above data permit a comparison of our findings with previously characterized tubulin phosphorylation studies. Most striking is the fact that the brain-specific βIII-tubulin isotype appears to be the principal tubulin isotype phosphorylated in brain tissue in vivo (27Khan I.A. Ludueña R.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3704-3711Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Dı́az-Nido J. Serrano L. Lopez-Otin C. Vandekerckhove J. Avila J. J. Biol.

In Elav mutant flies, neuroblasts fail to completely differentiate into neurons and result in embryonic lethality. It is thought that HuD, HuC, and Hel-N1 are also involved in neuronal differentiation, since they are expressed on termination of the neuroblast cell cycle (10Wakamatsu Y. Weston J.A.

Indeed, recent evidence has shown that HuD is necessary for neuronal differentiation. 1G. B. Aranda-Abreu, L. Chung, H. Furneaux, and I. Ginzburg, submitted for publication. Treatment of PC12 cells with nerve growth factor leads to cessation of the cell cycle and differentiation into neuron-like cells with neurite outgrowth (14Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4862) Google Scholar). Treatment of PC12 cells with antisense oligonucleotides directed against HuD abrogated their response to nerve growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: UTRuntranslated regionGSTglutathione S-transferase. In complementary experiments, Wakamatsu and Weston (10Wakamatsu Y. Weston J.A.

Thus, the Elav-like proteins are required for neuronal differentiation, and it is important to establish their mechanism of action. untranslated region glutathione S-transferase. The Elav-like proteins are RNA-binding proteins and contain three RNA recognition motifs of the RNP2/RNP1 type (15Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). The first and second of these RNA recognition motifs are in tandem and are separated from the third by a segment rich in basic amino acids. Many mRNAs contain U-rich regulatory elements that direct their rapid turnover (16Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3123) Google Scholar, 17Chen C.Y.A.

The Elav-like proteins specifically bind to these elements, stabilize the mRNA, and thereby increase its steady state level. (3Ma W.-J. Cheng S. Campbell C. Wright A. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

We know that that the Elav-like proteins regulate tau and GAP-43 mRNAs, two gene products necessary for the later stages of neuronal differentiation (24Chung S. Ekrich M. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).1 However, the Elav-like proteins are turned on very soon after the last S phase of the precursor neuroblast (6Marusich H.M. Furneaux H.M. Henion P. Weston J.A. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 143-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 11Barami K. Iversen K. Furneaux H. Goldman S.A. J. Neurobiol. 1995; 28: 82-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This event occurs before the documented changes in GAP-43 and tau expression. This suggested to us that the Elav-like proteins may regulate other mRNAs. In particular, we postulated that the Elav-like proteins may regulate mRNAs involved in the termination of the neuroblast cell cycle. In nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells, it is thought that the cessation of the cell cycle is primarily mediated by the induction of p21waf1(25Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6122-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J.

It is known that p21waf1 mRNA has a short half-life and can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level (30Schwaller J. Koeffler H.P. Niklaus G. Loetscher P. Nagel S. Fey M.F. Tobler A. J. Clin.

In this paper we show that HuD binds to a conserved U-rich element within the 3′-UTR2 of p21waf1 mRNA. pZL-waf1 plasmid DNA was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of α-[32P]uridine triphosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described previously (35Furneaux H.M.

DNA templates for the p21waf1 fragments AC, A, B, C, andBstEII-end were synthesized by polymerase chain reaction using the following oligonucleotides. For subfragment AC, corresponding to 3′-UTR nucleotides 636–1122, the oligonucleotides were (T7A5) TAATACGACTCACTATAGGCCTTAGTCTCAGTTTG and (C3) GGTCACCCTGCCCAA. For subfragment A, corresponding to 3′-UTR nucleotides 636–789, the oligonucleotides were (T7A5) and (A3) ACTCTTAGGAACCTCTCA. For subfragment B, corresponding to 3′-UTR nucleotides 767–893, the oligonucleotides were (T7B5) TCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGTTGAATGAGAGGTTCCT and (B3) GTAGCTGGCATGAAGC.

All polymerase chain reaction-synthesized templates were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of α-[32P]uridine triphosphate (Amersham) and gel-purified as described previously (35Furneaux H.M.

An overnight culture ofEscherichia coli BL 21 transformed with the GST-HuD construct (20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

At anA600 of 0.4, the culture was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.1 mm). After 4 h of further growth, cells were spun down and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). The cells were lysed by adding lysozyme (0.2 mg/ml) and Triton X-100 (1%). The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. The resultant supernatant was loaded onto a glutathione-agarose affinity column (13 mg of protein/ml of resin). After washing the column with buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1% Triton X-100), GST-HuD was eluted with 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 5 mm glutathione. The eluted material containing a predominant band of 67 kDa was pooled and stored at −70 °C. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mmNaCl, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 fmol of labeled RNA, and protein as indicated. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After incubation, 4 μl of a dye mixture (50% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol) was added. Five μl of the reaction mixture was immediately loaded onto a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mmEDTA) and electrophoresed at 40 V for 2.5 h. The gel was dried onto DE81 paper (Whatman) backed with gel drying paper and exposed to XAR5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 4–5 h at −70 °C. All experiments were repeated at least twice with identical results. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 20 fmol of radiolabeled mRNA, purified HuD as indicated. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, 0.5 units of RNase T1 was added to each reaction and incubated at 37 °C for an additional 10 min. The mixtures were diluted 1:6 with buffer F (20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05 mg/ml tRNA) and filtered through nitrocellulose (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). After washing the nitrocellulose twice with buffer F, bound HuD·RNA complex was extracted with phenol-chloroform and concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was dissolved in formamide buffer and denatured at 65 °C for 2 min. Samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide, 50% urea gel. Gels were fixed in 1:1:8 acetic acid:methanol:water, dried, and exposed to the XAR5 film at −70 °C overnight. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mmNaCl, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 10 fmol of radiolabeled mRNA, and purified HuD as indicated. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the mixtures were diluted 1:6 with buffer F and filtered through nitrocellulose. Filters were washed twice with buffer F, and bound radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. All data were reproducible within a fluctuation of 10%. The structure and sequence of the full-length p21waf1 mRNA (p21/SmaI, 2121 nucleotides) is shown in Fig.1. In the forthcoming text we will refer to the mRNA as only p21. This will simplify our references to the various subsegments. The transcript encoding this message is too large to assay using conventional gel retardation assays. Thus the RNase T1 selection assay (20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) was used to ascertain whether the p21 message contained a binding site for HuD. Radiolabeled transcript was incubated with purified recombinant HuD protein and treated with RNase T1, a specific endonuclease that cleaves after G residues. This reaction was conducted with saturating RNase T1 levels, so that all G residues in the transcript are hydrolyzed under the reaction conditions used. The reaction mixture was then filtered through nitrocellulose. RNA/protein complexes are absorbed to nitrocellulose (36Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). These complexes were eluted from the nitrocellulose by phenol/chloroform extraction and analyzed by gel electrophoresis in order identify the segments of the transcript that bound HuD. Three fragments of 24, 16, and 15 nucleotides were selected from the full-length transcript (p21/Sma, Fig. 1 A) by HuD (Fig. 2 A, lane 2), whereas no fragments were selected by a GST protein (lane 1), used as a negative control in this experiment. To map these binding sites more precisely, we used this assay to examine two truncated transcripts, p21/Pst and p21/BstEII (Fig. 1 A). The p21/BstEII transcript binds fragments of the same size as does the full-length transcript (p21/Sma), although the p21/PstI transcript fails to bind any fragments (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2,5, and 8, respectively). These data suggest that the HuD binding site lies between the PstI andBstEII sites. To confirm this, we used the RNase T1 selection assay to analyze the three adjacent transcripts, p21/BsrBI, p21/BsrBI-BstEII, and p21 BstEII-Sma (Fig. 1 A), that were synthesized to span the entire length of the p21 message. Since only the p21 BsrBI-BstEII transcript yielded the selected fragments (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6), the HuD binding site was localized to a region in the 3′-UTR between theBsrBI and BstEII sites. To quantitate the relative binding affinities of HuD to p21waf1 mRNA, we employed the method originally used for the R17 coat protein (36Carey J. Cameron V. de Haseth P.L. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2601-2610Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A low amount of labeled RNA (350 pm) was incubated with HuD protein under conditions of protein excess. The reactions were filtered through nitrocellulose, and the bound radioactivity was measured. Fig.3 A shows that the formation of p21/BsrBI-BstEII RNA·HuD complex is first detectable at a HuD concentration of 0.15 nm and plateaus at a concentration above 500 nm with about 72% of the input RNA bound. In contrast, complex formation with p21/BsrBI was not detectable even at 1000 nmHuD. A plot of the log of complex/free RNA versus the log of HuD concentration is shown in Fig. 3 B. From this plot, theKd of the p21/BsrBI-BstEII·HuD complex was determined to be 62.7 nm. Thus the affinity of HuD for p21 mRNA is similar to what we determined for c-fos mRNA (Kd = 19 nm) (20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We next examined the sequence of the p21/BsrBI-BstEII transcript (nucleotides 636–1122, Fig. 1 B) to delineate the likely location of the 15-, 16-, and 24-nucleotide binding sites. Based on this analysis, we divided p21/ BsrBI-BstEII segment into three contiguous transcripts: A, B, and C. Transcript A contains a 16-nucleotide RNase T1 fragment separated from a 24-nucleotide RNase T1 fragment by two nucleotides, whereas B contains two adjacent 15-nucleotide fragments, and C contains only a single 16-nucleotide fragment. Transcripts A, B, C, and p21 BsrBI-BstEII were then tested for HuD binding by gel retardation analysis (Fig.4 A). Purified recombinant HuD was incubated with labeled transcript and assayed for complex formation. HuD binds both p21/BsrBI-BstEII and A with similar affinity (lanes 3–5 and 8–10, respectively) and with a considerably lower affinity to B (lanes 13–15). No binding to C was observed within the range of HuD concentrations tested (lanes 18–20). As expected, no complex formation was observed with transcripts A, B, or C when HuD was replaced by GST (lanes 2, 7, 12, and17). These semiquantitative observations were confirmed by nitrocellulose binding assays by which the Kd values of p21/BsrBI-BstEII, A, B, and C were determined to be 62.7, 85.6, 757, and 10,700 nm, respectively. On the basis of these data, it is likely that transcript A contains the major HuD binding site within the 3′-UTR of p21waf1 mRNA. A minor HuD binding site appears to also be present in B, whereas no site with significant affinity for HuD is observed in C. To confirm the location of the HuD binding sites within p21waf1 mRNA, transcripts A and B were further analyzed by the RNase T1 selection assay (Fig. 4 B). Fragments of 24 and 16 nucleotides in length were selected after incubation of transcript A with HuD (lane 5), whereas a 15-nucleotide fragment was the predominant species selected after the binding of transcript B to HuD (lane 8). As expected, no fragments were selected when HuD was incubated with p21/BsrBI (lane 2) or from any of the transcripts incubated with GST (lanes 1, 4, and 7). In the RNase T1 selection assay, it is possible that a selected fragment could result from the protection by HuD of one or more G residues situated between two smaller fragments. The three selected fragments (24, 16, and 15 nucleotides) were gel-purified and incubated with RNase T1 to determine whether they contain any protected G residues (Fig. 4 C,lanes 2, 4, and 6 and lanes 1, 3, and 5, respectively). No new digestion products were observed, thus indicating that the observed fragments are as predicted 24, 16, (transcript A), and 15 nucleotides (transcript B) in length. To ensure that the Rnase T1 used in these experiments was active, the entire transcript B was digested by RNase T1 as a positive control (lane 8). Thus, based on the data obtained by gel retardation, RNase T1 digestion, and nitrocellulose binding assays, we conclude that the major binding site in p21waf1 mRNA is localized to a 42-nucleotide region (nucleotides 657–698) within the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1 B,boldface). This site is similar to other HuD binding sites in that it contains U-rich tracts (19Ma W.J. Chung S. Furneaux H.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3564-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol.

However, unlike other known HuD binding sites, two G residues are present within the site in p21waf1, and we obtained two fragments in the selection assay. If the localization of the 24- and 16-nucleotide fragments is correct, we should be able to select a 42-nucleotide fragment from a partial digest of p21 mRNA. Thus, we generated partial digests of p21/A using limiting concentrations of RNase T1 (Fig.5 A, lanes 7–12). As before, HuD selected fragments of 24 and 16 nucleotides from complete digests (lanes 1–2). However, as predicted, HuD selected a 42-nucleotide fragment from the first partial digest and progressively larger fragments from less digested RNA (lanes 3–5). Concomitant with the selection of the 42-nucleotide fragment was the disappearance of both the 24- and 16-nucleotide fragments (lanes 3–4). At all concentrations of RNase T1 tested, HuD binding to these fragments was specific. This was shown by the lack of selected fragments from similar partial digests of a transcript that lacks a HuD binding site (Fig. 5 B,lanes 1–12). These data indicate that the minimal HuD binding site is 42 nucleotides in length. We have compared the sequence of the p21 mRNA binding site with those we have found in c-fos, c-myc, tau, interleukin-3, and GAP-43 mRNAs (Fig.6 A). The p21 binding site is similar to the others in that it contains U-rich tracts. We have shown that these U-rich tracts are essential for the binding of HuD to the c-fos element (20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The importance of the U tract sequences in the p21 site is further underscored by their strict conservation between human, mouse, and rat p21 mRNAs (Fig. 6 B). Next, we tested whether the HuD·p21mRNA complex would be displaced by the c-fos binding site. The sequence AUAUUUAUAUUUUUAUUUUAUUUUUUU, termed the c-fos element, has been determined to be the minimal HuD binding site within c-fos mRNA (20Chung S. Jiang L. Cheng S. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11518-11524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Another oligonucleotide, a mutated c-fos element with the sequence AUACGUAUAUCGCUAUGCUAUUUUUUU that fails to bind HuD, served as the negative control in these experiments. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of unlabeled c-fos element oligonucleotide in molar excess displaced the HuD·p21/BsrBI-BstEII complex in a gel retardation assay (lanes 3–5). No complex displacement was observed when the same molar amounts of the mutated c-fos element was added (lanes 6–8). We can therefore conclude that the binding site in p21 is similar to the one in c-fos mRNA and indeed to sites in c-myc, tau Il-3, and GAP-43 mRNAs. The Elav-like proteins have emerged as an important class of proteins that are pleotropic effectors of gene expression in mammalian cells. There are four members of the human family HuD, HuC, Hel-N1, and HuR (1Szabo A. Dalmau J. Manley G. Rosenfeld M.R. Wong E. Henson J. Posner J.B. Furneaux H.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar).These U-rich elements are found in a wide variety of mRNAs and usually target them for rapid degradation (17Chen C.Y.A. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). The current model is that activation of the Elav-like proteins leads to the stabilization of a specific subset of mRNAs. It is likely that this mechanism is responsible for the induction of neuronal differentiation by the neuronal-specific Elav-like proteins. Some of the target mRNAs stabilized by the Elav-like proteins during neuronal differentiation have been identified. Two targets, GAP-43 and tau, are required for the later steps in neuronal differentiation (24Chung S. Ekrich M. Perrone-Bizzozero N. Kohn D.T. Furneaux H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6593-6598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).1 The neuronal Elav-like proteins, however, are expressed before the up-regulation of GAP-43 and tau mRNA. Thus we have looked for new mRNAs targets that may directly affect the neuroblast cell cycle. In nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells, there is compelling evidence to suggest that the induction of p21waf1, an inhibitor of cyclin-cdk complexes as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, plays a critical role in arresting these cells at G1/S, a requisite early step in cell differentiation (25Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6122-6132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Yan G.Z. Ziff E.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 6200-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we examined the interaction between p21waf1 mRNA and HuD. In this report, we have localized a high affinity HuD binding site to a conserved 42-nucleotide region within a U-rich tract in the 3′-UTR of p21waf1 mRNA. Thus, given that the Elav-like proteins regulate other mRNAs with similar sites, it is very likely that the Elav-like proteins will regulate p21waf1 mRNA. With the detailed knowledge of the p21waf1 binding site reported here, experiments to directly test this possibility can now be carried out. Surprisingly, possible changes in the half-life of p21waf1mRNA during neurogenesis have not yet been examined. Recent studies, however, in other cell systems have shown that the half-life of p21waf1 is regulated by diverse signals. In these systems, regulation cannot be due to binding of HuD or any of the other neuronal-specific members of the family. Rather, it is more likely to be mediated by the ubiquitously expressed member of the Elav-like protein family, HuR, which has also been shown to bind to this region of the p21waf1 message (data not shown). p21waf1 is up-regulated in p53-deficient promyelocytic HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the monocytic lineage by phorbol ester or 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. (30Schwaller J. Koeffler H.P. Niklaus G. Loetscher P. Nagel S. Fey M.F. Tobler A. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The marked increases of both p21waf1 mRNA and protein expression observed in these cells is due to enhanced mRNA stability. Similar increases in p21waf1 mRNA stability were observed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (37Shao Z.-M. Dawson M.I. Li X.-S. Rishi A.K. Sheikh M.S. Han Q.X. Ordonez J.V. Shroot B. Fontana J.A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 493-504PubMed Google Scholar) and in MDA-MB-468 cells (a p53-mutant derivative of MCF-7 cells) induced to differentiate with the retinoid CD437 (31Li X.S. Rishi A.K. Shao Z.M. Dawson M.I. Jong L. Shroot B. Reichart U. Ordonez J. Fontana J.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5055-5062PubMed Google Scholar). Zeng and El-Deiry (32Zeng Y.-X. El-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar) found that okadaic acid, a potent serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, induced p53-independent expression of p21waf1, both at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in several human tumor cell lines. It has recently been reported (13Gorospe M. Wang X. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) that UVC irradiation elevates p21waf1 mRNA expression in mouse embryonal fibroblasts and human rectal carcinoma cells by significantly enhancing the stability of the mRNA encoding p21waf1. They provide experimental evidence indicating that this effect is mediated by a tyrosine kinase/phosphatase regulatory system (possibly one modulated by c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) and, in contrast to the systems already discussed, requires the presence of functional p53. Thus it will be interesting to see if the binding of the Elav-like proteins to p21waf1 mRNA is activated by any of these signals. The connection drawn here between mRNA stability, differentiation and the cell cycle is a novel one. It has been tacitly assumed that transcriptional control is the rate-limiting pathway that defines commitment to differentiation. A distinctive feature of the mechanism postulated here is that the Elav-like proteins are capable of coordinately regulating a subclass of mRNAs. We have recently observed that the Elav-like proteins also bind to p27 mRNA, another negative regulator of the cell cycle. 3S. Millard, B. Joseph, H. Furneaux, and A. Koff, unpublished observation. These observations raise the possibility that abrogation of Elav-like protein activity in differentiated cells may coordinately destabilize mRNAs encoding negative regulators of the cell cycle. Indeed an important future goal will be to investigate whether this would lead to reentry into S phase and cell proliferation. We thank Andrew Koff for his very valuable comments on the manuscript."

Pretreatment of Jurkat T-cells with 8-bromo cAMP (8-Br-cAMP) or prostaglandin E2 increased PDE3 and PDE4 activity in an actinomycin D- and cycloheximide-sensitive manner. This effect was associated with increased expression of HSPDE3B, HSPDE4A4, HSPDE4D1, HSPDE4D2, and HSPDE4D3 mRNA transcripts. Western analysis reproducibly labeled a band of immunoreactivity in vehicle-treated cells that corresponded to HSPDE4A4 (125 kDa). Although the intensity of this band was unchanged in cells treated with 8-Br-cAMP, additional 68–72-kDa proteins (HSPDE4D2, HSPDE4D1) were labeled that were not detected after vehicle. Similar results were obtained with T-lymphocytes exposed to 8-Br-cAMP and fenoterol. However, in those experiments HSPDE4A4 and HSPDE4D1 appeared to be equally expressed in vehicle- and treated cells, whereas HSPDE4D2 (72 kDa) was detected only after 8-Br-cAMP. The up-regulation of PDE activity in Jurkat T-cells abolished the ability of isoproterenol to elevate cAMP, which was partially reversed by the non-selective PDE inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and by the PDE3 and PDE4 inhibitors, Org 9935 and rolipram, respectively. Collectively, these data suggest that chronic treatment of T-cells with cAMP-elevating agents compromises β2-adrenoreceptor-mediated cAMP accumulation by increasing the expression of HSPDE3B and HSPDE4D gene products.

Currently, PDEs are categorized in to seven broad families (see Ref. 1Beavo J.A. Conti M. Heaslip R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 399-405PubMed Google Scholar for nomenclature) that are distinguished by a number of criteria including substrate specificity, kinetic properties, sensitivity to allosteric modulators and synthetic inhibitors, and primary amino acid sequence (2Beavo J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1988; 22: 1-38PubMed Google Scholar, 3Giembycz M.A. Kelly J.J. Costello J.F. Piper P.J. Methylxanthines and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors in the Treatment of Airways Disease. Parthenon Publishing, London1994: 27-80Google Scholar). In many cases, these families comprise multiple subtypes, which suggests that the degradation of cAMP and cGMP is a highly complex and tightly regulated process.Over the last decade, the possible applications of PDE inhibitors to the treatment of an array of inflammatory diseases including asthma and atopic dermatitis has been realized. In particular, the cAMP-specific PDE, or PDE4, is viewed by the pharmaceutical industry as a viable molecular locus amenable to therapeutic intervention with selective inhibitors. The selection of this enzyme family as a possible drug target comes from the knowledge that PDE4 is the predominant, if not exclusive, regulator of cAMP homeostasis in essentially all pro-inflammatory and immune cells. Moreover, PDE4 inhibitors suppress many functional indices of cell activation that are considered pro-inflammatory (4Dent G. Giembycz M.A. Clin.

The most extensively investigated gene is PDE4D, which can produce at least five structurally distinct proteins that are subject to different regulatory constraints (20Bolger G.B. Erdogan S. Jones R.

In addition, activation of other up-stream promoters results in the ultimate translation of “long” forms of the enzyme that have been designated PDE4D3, PDE4D4, and PDE4D5 (14Bolger G. Michaeli T.

Preliminary data suggest also that the structural organization of the PDE4A and PDE4B genes is similar to PDE4D in that both short and long forms of the enzyme can, theoretically, be transcribed (21Conti M. Nemoz G. Sette C. Vicini E. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 370-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been suggested that induction of PDE4 could occur in certain diseases such as asthma when β2-adrenoreceptor agonist therapy is taken chronically (27Torphy T.J. Zhou H.-L. Foley J.J. Sarau H.M. Manning C.D. Barnette M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23598-23604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Giembycz M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the functional consequences of this phenomenon are uncertain, a prediction based on in vitroexperiments is a heterologous desensitization of Gs-coupled receptors (27Torphy T.J. Zhou H.-L. Foley J.J. Sarau H.M. Manning C.D. Barnette M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23598-23604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Giembycz M.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, in asthma, induction of PDE4 could prove detrimental by compromising the therapeutic effects of β2-adrenoreceptors agonists and the anti-inflammatory actions of endogenous activators of adenylyl cyclase (27Torphy T.J.

Sci. 1996; 17: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Of those cells that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, T-lymphocytes play a pivotal role and are believed to orchestrate the chronic eosinophilic inflammation that is a hallmark of this disease (30Corrigan C.J.

Given that T-lymphocytes represent a therapeutic target for PDE4 inhibitors, the current study was performed to (i) identify the PDE4 subtypes in Jurkat T-cells and human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes, (ii) determine if those isoenzyme detected are up-regulated by cAMP, and (iii) assess if an increase in PDE4 affects cell signaling through Gs-coupled receptors. Since T-cells also express PDE3 (31Giembycz M.A. Corrigan C.J. Seybold J. Newton R. Barnes P.J. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 118: 1945-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,32Tenor H.

One explanation for the failure of these drugs to resolve asthmatic inflammation is the development of tolerance by pro-inflammatory cells within the lung due to direct receptor desensitization mediated by one or more G-protein receptor-coupled kinases or PKA (45Premont R.T.

In this study, we have tested an alternative and largely ignored hypothesis, which proposes that desensitization of Gs-coupled receptors is due to the up-regulation of PDE in relevant cells and a consequent increase in their ability to degrade cAMP (26Sette C.

Identical results were obtained with PGE2 (Jurkat) and fenoterol (T-lymphocyte), suggesting that the increase in the rate of cAMP hydrolysis was due to enhanced transcription of one or more PDE genes (as reported in other cells types; Refs. 49Kovala T.

Induction of PDE by cAMP has been reported in several cell types including macrophages (51Kochetkova M. Burns F.M.F. Souness J.E. Biochem.

However, in contrast to the aforementioned cells, where the up-regulation of PDE is transient, PDE activity in Jurkat T-cells, which was monitored over a period of 24 h, increased more slowly. Although the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, several possibilities are worthy of consideration. A plausible explanation is a difference in the expression and/or regulation of PDE4 isogenes between cell types. Indeed, whereas mRNA for HSPDE4B1 was not detected in vehicle- and 8-Br-cAMP-treated Jurkat T-cells, other studies have unambiguously identified HSPDE4B in a number of cells (19Obernolte R. Bhakta S.

Ther. 1996; 276: 810-818PubMed Google Scholar). This is significant since PDE4B appears to be induced far more rapidly than either PDE4A or PDE4D gene products (28Verghese M.W. McConnell R.T. Lenhard J.M. Hamacher L. Jin S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1164-1171PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, considerable variability in the abundance of HSPDE4B1 mRNA transcripts in T-lymphocytes was noted between donors. Similarly, the effect of 8-Br-cAMP on PDE4B gene expression was routinely inconsistent which negated an analysis of the comparative kinetics of PDE4A, PDE4B, and PDE4D gene induction. An additional explanation is that PDE3 is either absent or not up-regulated in the other cell types examined, which could account for the difference in kinetics if these isoenzymes are induced over a time frame that differs from PDE4. The results of this study demonstrate that, of the two human PDE3 genes that have been identified (35Maecci E. Taira M. Moos M. Smith C.J. Movsesian M.A. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3721-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 36Miki T Taira M. Hockman S. Shimada F. Lieman J. Napolitano M. Ward D. Makino H. Manganiello V.C. Genomics. 1996; 36: 476-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Jurkat T-cells and human T-lymphocytes express the “adipocyte” or HSPDE3B isoenzyme. Although it is well established that cAMP can activate HSPDE3B by PKA-dependent phosphorylation (55Gettys T.W. Vine A.J. Simonds M.F. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10359-10363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 56Smith C.J. Vasta V. Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13385-13390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the results of this study suggest that, in T-cells, gene induction is primarily responsible for the increase in Org 9935-sensitive activity as evinced from the enhanced expression of HSPDE3B mRNA transcripts and the ability of actinomycin D and cycloheximide to block the up-regulation of PDE3.Although we failed to detect message for HSPDE4B1 (Jurkats only) and HSPDE4C1 after 40 cycles of amplification, transcripts for HSPDE4A4, which provides the only catalytically active product from this locus in humans (14Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) and is a major isoenzyme in peripheral blood monocytes (37Némoz G. Zhang R.B. Sette C. Conti M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was reproducibly identified in both Jurkat T-cells and T-lymphocytes, together with HSPDE4D1, HSPDE4D2, and HSPDE4D3. The detection of spliced variants of the PDE4D gene is consistent with PDE4D multiplicity reported in the rat (22Monaco L. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 347-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and humans (37Némoz G. Zhang R.B. Sette C. Conti M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and supports the assertion that splicing of this gene is conserved during evolution (37Némoz G. Zhang R.B. Sette C. Conti M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Given that T-cells have the potential to express multiple cAMP PDE isoenzymes, experiments were performed to determine the extent to which of these could account for the increase in PDE activity. Detailed RT-PCR studies with 8-Br-cAMP-treated Jurkat T-cells identified HSPDE4A4, HSPDE4D1, and HSPDE4D2 as good candidates since kinetic studies demonstrated that message for these proteins was significantly elevated prior to a detectable increase in enzyme activity, which is what would be predicted if a causal relationship exists between these two events. In addition, a time-dependent increase in HSPDE4D3 mRNA was also detected but only several hoursafter PDE activity had started to rise. Although these data suggest that HSPDE4D3 is unlikely to contribute to the early increase in PDE activity, this isoenzyme was not immediately discounted since it could play a supportive role at late (24 h) time points. Transcripts for HSPDE3B and HSPDE4A4 and the D1, D2, and D3 splice variants of the PDE4 gene were also elevated in 8-Br-cAMP-treated T-lymphocytes at 24 h, indicating a similar mechanism of PDE gene expression to that observed in Jurkat T-cells.To address which transcripts might account for the increase in the rate of cAMP hydrolysis, the PDE4 isoenzymes expressed by vehicle- and 8-Br-cAMP-treated Jurkat T-cells and T-lymphocytes were identified by immunoblotting using an antiserum, α-galK-hPDE1, that recognizes all forms of PDE4 (27Torphy T.J.

Livi G.P. Cieslinski L.B. Torphy T.J. Barnette M.S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 810-818PubMed Google Scholar). In both cell preparations, α-galK-hPDE1 labeled a strong band of immunoreactivity that was identical to the predicted size of HSPDE4A4 (14Bolger G. Michaeli T. Martins T. St. John T. Steiner B. Rodgers L. Riggs M. Wigler M. Ferguson K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6558-6571Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), an isoenzyme that has since been unambiguously identified in human monocytes and T-lymphocytes (27Torphy T.J. Zhou H.-L.

Ther. 1996; 276: 810-818PubMed Google Scholar). In Jurkat T-cells (and possibly T-lymphocytes), a weak 93-kDa band of immunoreactivity was also labeled by the antibody, which had a mass identical to that expected of HSPDE4D3 and was in keeping with the unequivocal identification of HSPDE4D3 mRNA in these cells. In addition, T-lymphocytes constitutively expressed a 67-kDa protein not detected in Jurkat T-cells of the predicted molecular weight of HSPDE4D2. Intriguingly, although 8-Br-cAMP increased message for HSPDE4A4, HSPDE4D2 and HSPDE4D3, it did not alter the intensity of the 125- and 93-kDa bands in Jurkat T-cells or the corresponding 122-, 95-, and 67-kDa bands in T-lymphocytes in Western blots after 6 and 24 h of culture. Thus, it would seem that these isoenzymes did not contribute significantly to the overall increase in PDE activity (see below) or that their turnover was rapid. In contrast, a strong and highly reproducible band of immunoreactivity was labeled by α-galK-hPDE1 in both cell preparation after 8-Br-cAMP that was not detected in cells exposed to vehicle. Although we cannot state with certainty the identity of this protein, it probably represents HSPDE4D1 since: (i) it had a molecular mass of 72 kDa, which is almost identical to the molecular mass of HSPDE4D1 extracted from mononuclear cells (28Verghese M.W. McConnell R.T. Lenhard J.M. Hamacher L. Jin S.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1164-1171PubMed Google Scholar,37Némoz G. Zhang R.B. Sette C. Conti M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); (ii) it routinely migrated with a fainter 68-kDa protein, which is consistent with the highly related splice variant, HSPDE4D2 (this protein is identical to HSPDE4D1 other than for an 86-base pair deletion in its 5′ alternatively spliced region, which results in the expression of a slightly smaller protein); and (iii) an increase in HSPDE4D1 and HDPDE4D2 message was reproducibly detected in Jurkat T-cell and T-lymphocytes exposed to 8-Br-cAMP. Taken together, these data indicate that as far as the PDE4 isoenzyme family is concerned, cAMP is hydrolyzed in unstimulated Jurkat T-cells principally by HSPDE4A4 and, to a lesser extent, HSPDE4D3, which act as “housekeeping” isoenzymes that are not markedly influenced by hormones at the protein level. In T-lymphocytes HSPDE4D2 might also regulate basal cAMP homeostasis. This contrasts with the increased rate of cAMP hydrolysis in cells exposed to 8-Br-cAMP, which is attributable to induction of the PDE4D gene via increased transcription and/or stabilization of preexisting mRNAs followed by an increase in catalytically active HSPDE4D1 and, in Jurkat T-cells, possibly HSPDE4D2.Up-regulation of HSPDE4D1 and HSPDE4D2 mRNA was also seen in Jurkat T-cells exposed to PGE2 and, to a lesser extent, rolipram, indicating that this phenomenon can be also elicited by agents that activate Gs-coupled receptors and inhibit PDE4 respectively. Moreover, in two experiments PGE2 and rolipram clearly acted in synergistic manner, which strongly supports a central role of cAMP in the up-regulation of HSPDE4D1 and HSPDE4D2 mRNAs.A somewhat unexpected result was that 8-Br-cAMP failed to increase protein for HSPDE4A4 in Jurkat T-cells or T-lymphocytes. Although this is entirely consistent with the inability of cAMP-elevating drugs to up-regulate PDE4A4 in the murine MA-10 Leydig tumor cell line (50Swinnen J.V. Tsikalas K.E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18370-18377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is nevertheless at variance with observations made with human monocytes (28Verghese M.W. McConnell R.T. Lenhard J.M.

(1994) N. Engl. J. Med. 330, 962–968). In order to elucidate its etiology, we have investigated the involvement of mitochondrial function in insulin secretion. Culture of the pancreatic β-cell line, βHC9, with low dose ethidium bromide (EB) (0.4 μg/ml) for 2–6 days resulted in a substantial decrease in the transcription level of mitochondrial DNA (to 10–20% of the control cells) without changing its copy number, whereas the transcription of nuclear genes was grossly unaffected. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that treatment by EB caused morphological changes only in mitochondria and not in other organelles such as nuclei, endoplasmic reticula, Golgi bodies, or secretory granules. When the cells were treated with EB for 6 days, glucose (20 mm) could no longer stimulate insulin secretion, while glibenclamide (1 μm) still did. When EB was removed after 3- or 6-day treatment, mitochondrial gene transcription recovered within 2 days, and the profiles of insulin secretion returned to normal within 7 days. Studies with fura-2 indicated that in EB-treated cells, glucose (20 mm) failed to increase intracellular Ca2+, while the effect of glibenclamide (1 μm) was maintained.

Our system provides a unique way to investigate the relationship between mitochondrial function and insulin secretion. The mitochondrial genome of mammalian cells encodes 13 polypeptides, two ribosomal RNAs, and 22 transfer RNAs (for a review, see Ref. 1Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). The mitochondrion is believed to be an organelle derived from a genetic component(s) of microorganisms, and thus its replication, transcription, and translation system has been developed on its own basis, although several nuclear genome-encoded proteins are also essential for these systems. Mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation are composed of enzyme complexes (I–IV) and cooperate with a number of nuclear genome-encoded proteins for ATP production. Currently, the following hypothesis is widely accepted as a major part of the glucose-signaling pathways for insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. First, glucose is transported into the pancreatic β-cells and metabolized through the glycolytic pathway and Krebs cycle. ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation within the mitochondria. The increased ATP and decreased ADP concentrations cause depolarization of the plasma membrane via closure of ATP-sensitive K+channels. Depolarization activates the voltage-dependent calcium channels and increases [Ca2+]i. This increase in [Ca2+]i stimulates exocytosis of insulin granules from the pancreatic β-cells (for a review, see Ref.2Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Ashcroft F.M. Ashcroft S.J.H. Insulin: Molecular Biology to Pathology. Oxford University Press, Oxford1992: 97-150Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest an important role for the mitochondria in this pathway. First, ATP-sensitive K+channels are believed to “sense” ATP produced by mitochondria and to convert the information into depolarization of membrane potential. The presence of this type of channels in pancreatic β-cells was first demonstrated by electrophysiological approaches (3Cook D.L. Hales C.N.

Second, 2-ketoisocaproate, which is metabolized intramitochondrially, exerts the same stimulatory effects on insulin secretion as glucose does (7Lenzen S. Formanek H. Panten U. J. Biol.

However, there are few reports that have demonstrated a correlation between mitochondrial (dys)function and insulin secretion directly. To examine the relationship between mitochondrial function and the stimulation of insulin release, we employed a newly developed insulin-secreting cell line, βHC9 (15Radvanyi F. Christgau S.

To date, few detailed studies on the role(s) of mitochondrial function in glucose signaling have been performed. In one of these, in which bis-4-piperidyle-dichloride was employed to establish a ρ0 cell line in the MIN6 insulin-secreting cell, it was shown that the presence of mitochondria was essential for glucose-stimulated insulin release (18Soejima A.

It has been reported that EB, a reagent that inhibits DNA/RNA synthesis, affects transcription/replication of extrachromosomal genetic materials more specifically than those of chromosomal genes (19Zybler E.

Recently, human cell lines lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0 cells) were established by long term treatment with low concentrations of EB (22King M.P. Attardi G.

In this report, we investigated the effects of EB treatment and the virtual elimination of mitochondrial transcription on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and on [Ca2+]i. EB treatment blocked the effect of glucose to increase [Ca2+]i and to stimulate insulin secretion. The effect of EB was completely reversed after removal of the EB. These results provide strong evidence that mitochondrial function is crucial for the stimulation of insulin release by glucose. Restriction enzymes and DNA-modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan). EB, bovine serum albumin (BSA), nifedipine, and fura-2 were obtained from Sigma, and [α-32P]dCTP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Glibenclamide was provided by Hoechst Co., Ltd. βHC9 was a kind gift from Dr. D. Hanahan (University of California). βHC9 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mm glucose, 0.11 mg/ml pyruvate, and 0.05 mg/ml uridine supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin in 5% CO2. Cells reaching 70–90% confluency were divided to a density of 3 × 104/cm2. For the treated cells, EB was added to the culture medium 18–24 h after plating. Cells of passages near passage 20 were used for experiments, except for the experiments for Fig. 6 and Table III, for which passages 31 and 29 were used, respectively.Table IIIReversibility of the changes caused by EB after its removal at passage 29TreatmentFractional secretionBasal (0.1 mm glucose)With 20 mm glucoseWith 1 μm glibenclamide%/2 h6-day EB2.59 ± 0.673.26 ± 0.90 NSaDifference not significant between this test group and 0.1 mm glucose.6.86 ± 1.15bp < 0.01 for the difference between this test group and 0.1 mm glucose.6 days after removal of 6-day EB1.15 ± 0.224.46 ± 0.29bp < 0.01 for the difference between this test group and 0.1 mm glucose.6.06 ± 0.43bp < 0.01 for the difference between this test group and 0.1 mm glucose.Secretion from βHC9 cells by glucose and glibenclamide was evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures” after 6-day treatment by EB (0.4 μg/ml) and further culture in normal medium for 6 days after its removal.

Radioactivity of hybridizing bands was measured by BAS2000 image analyzer, and the relative amount of each transcript was determined. Glucose-phosphorylating activities by hexokinase (HK) and glucokinase (GK) of either control or EB-treated cells on day 4 were determined fluorometrically as described previously (29Miwa I. Mita Y.

The control and EB-treated cells were fixed overnight with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.3). They were postfixed with 2% OsO4 in the same buffer, followed by en block staining with 1% uranyl acetate. After dehydration with a graded series of ethanol, they were substituted by propylene oxide and embedded in Spurr's low viscosity resin. Silver to gold sections were cut and examined with a JEOL 1010 electron microscope (JEOL, Tokyo, Japan.). The control and EB-treated cells were cultured in 12-well plates. Each well was washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with 1 ml of Hanks‘-BSA medium composed of Hanks’ buffered saline containing 0.2% BSA and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, plus 0.1 mmglucose in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After incubation for 2 h, the medium was replaced with 1 ml of the Hanks‘-BSA medium containing various secretagogues. For the experiment shown in Fig. 6, Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer was used instead of Hanks’ buffer. After incubation for 2 h, the medium was collected and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C until radioimmunoassay for insulin concentration. For determination of insulin content in the cells, each well was washed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 1 ml of a solution containing 74% ethanol and 1.4% HCl and kept at −20 °C for 18–24 h. Then the supernatant was collected and stored at −20 °C until assayed. Radioimmunoassay kits (Shionoria; Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Japan) were used for the determination of insulin levels using mouse insulin as standard. Total cellular proteins were extracted by boiling the trypsinized cells in 1% SDS, and protein concentration was determined by the method described by Lowry (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with BSA as a standard. Control and EB-treated cells were cultured on a glass coverslip in a 6-cm diameter dish. Each dish was washed twice with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 4 ml of Hanks'-BSA medium for 40 min. The cells were then loaded with fura-2 for 40 min in 4 ml of the Hanks'-BSA medium containing 4 μm fura-2 acetoxymethylester (added from a 1 mm stock solution in dimethyl sulfoxide) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The glass coverslips were washed three times with 2 ml of the Hanks'-BSA medium before measurement of [Ca2+]i. The [Ca2+]i was measured before and then 15 and 30 min after stimulation by replacement with the Hanks'-BSA medium containing 20 mm glucose or 1 μmglibenclamide. All measurements of [Ca2+]i were carried out at 37 °C. A dual excitation digital imaging system (Argus 100 image analysis system; Hamamatsu Photonics Inc., Japan) was used for the measurements. Epi-illumination at 340- or 360-nm wavelength from a mercury lamp was used to excite fura-2. Emitted fluorescence was magnified through a fluorescence objective lens (× 10; Nikon Inc., Japan) taken by a silicon-intensified tube camera, and then converted into a digitized value of 256 gray levels at each pixel. Paired fluorescence images by 360-nm wavelength excitation were taken before and after a single measurement and interpolated each time. The signal fluorescence by 340-nm wavelength was converted into a ratio divided by the value of interpolated 360 nm at each pixel to yield a pseudocolor image of [Ca2+]i (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Conversion from the ratio to [Ca2+]i was performed using a Ca2+-EGTA standard (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Data were expressed as two-dimensional mean values of [Ca2+]i, which were calculated by averaging the values of all of the pixels over the cellular area. Data shown are means ± S.D. of triplicate observations in a single representative experiment unless otherwise indicated. TableI summarizes the characteristics of insulin secretion and insulin content in βHC9 cells. Analyses were carried out when cells reached 70–90% confluency. Twenty mm glucose induced a substantial increase in insulin secretion from the basal level (0.1 mm glucose alone). Half-maximal effect of glucose on insulin secretion was obtained at 10–15 mm (shown later), consistent with the results of Radvanyi et al. (15Radvanyi F. Christgau S. Baekkeskov S. Jolicoeur C. Hanahan D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4223-4232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Noda et al. (17Noda M. Komatsu M. Sharp G.W.G. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 1766-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Glibenclamide (1 μm), KCl (20 mm), and 2-ketoisocaproate (10 mm) also stimulated insulin secretion. In other experiments, it was shown that nifedipine (100 nm), an inhibitor of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibited the stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose (20 mm) or glibenclamide (1 μm) (percentage of inhibition: 89.3 ± 6.9% and 81.7 ± 11.9%, respectively), and it was also shown that these secretagogues did not increase the insulin content during 2-h incubations (total insulin content after 2-h incubation was 100 ± 6, 105 ± 9, and 99 ± 12% for 0.1 mm glucose, the addition of 20 mm glucose, and 1 μm glibenclamide, respectively).Table IInsulin secretion from βHC9 cells by glucose and other secretagoguesSecretagogueInsulin secretionInsulin contentng/mg cellular protein/2 hng/mg cellular protein0.1 mm glucose50 ± 133390 ± 879 With 20 mmglucose810 ± 121NDaND, not done.

Attardi G. Science. 1989; 246: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows changes in gene transcription in EB-treated cells measured by Northern blot analyses. The mitochondrial DNA probe used for these analyses detected several transcripts (two rRNAs, 10 tRNAs, and four peptides), including two major hybridized bands. The relative quantity of the mitochondrial transcripts was calculated in comparison with the radioactivity of 16 S transcript(s). These analyses showed that the reduction of mitochondrial transcription by EB treatment occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, and the mitochondrial transcription level of EB-treated (0.4 μg/ml) cells was reduced to 10–20% of the control cells, whereas the transcription of the insulin gene was not affected. Transcription of β-actin was also unaffected as described below. The copy number of mitochondrial DNA was not changed by EB treatment at the concentrations below 2.5 μg/ml (Fig. 1 B); the cells could not grow at EB concentrations over 6 μg/ml. We examined the temporal profiles of mitochondrial transcription and insulin secretion 1–6 days after the addition of EB. On days 4–6, the growth of EB-treated cells was significantly retarded (see below). On days 3–6, mitochondrial transcription levels of the control cells were enhanced, whereas those of EB-treated cells were inhibited by 80–90% compared with control cells (Fig. 2). In contrast, transcription of the insulin gene showed little change between treated and untreated cells (Fig. 2). Expression of “housekeeping” genes also seemed to be unaffected by EB treatment, when the messenger RNA of β-actin was assessed on day 0, 2, 4, and 6 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using the Mouse β-Actin Control Amplimer Set (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) (data not shown). Analysis by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of cells treated with EB for 6 days also showed that transcription of major glucose-sensing enzymes, GK and HK-I, was not altered significantly (data not shown). In accord with this, glucose-phosphorylating activities by HK and GK were not changed between EB-treated and control cells on day 4 (Fig.3).Figure 3Glucose phosphorylating activities by HK and GK (Vmax). The solid bars denote control cells, and open bars represent EB-treated cells (0.4 μg/ml for 4 days). Values are expressed in mol kg DNA−1 h −1, as mean ± S.D. (n = 3) from a single representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) On electron microscopic analysis (Fig. 4), βHC9 cells contained electron-dense secretory granules in their cytoplasm, which probably represented insulin-containing granules, because fluorescence microscopy of anti-insulin antibody to these cells revealed fine granular staining in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Although dead or damaged cells were occasionally seen after EB treatment, most of the cells looked morphologically intact, as also shown by phase-contrast microscopy (data not shown). The only prominent finding observed in these cells was the frequent appearance of ring- or cup- shaped mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). No changes were found in other organelles including Golgi apparatus or dense core granules. Basal insulin secretion (0.1 mm glucose) of the control cells maintained a constant low level during cell proliferation. The stimulatory effect of glucose (20 mm) on insulin secretion was gradually increased, and the maximal effect was observed on day 6 (confluency had reached 70–90% at this time). A similar temporal profile to that of glucose-induced insulin secretion was observed with glibenclamide (1 μm)-stimulated insulin release (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, in EB-treated cells, glucose-stimulated insulin release was completely abolished by day 5–6, although the stimulatory effect of glibenclamide was still observed (Fig. 5 B). The insulin content of EB-treated cells was higher than those of the control cells (tested on days 4 and 6; Table II). In addition, glucose-phosphorylating activity by either HK or GK was unchanged between EB-treated and control cells (on day 4; Fig. 3). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of these two enzymes of the cells treated with EB for 6 days showed similar expression levels to those of control cells (data not shown).Table IIInsulin content and fractional secretion from EB-treated and control βHC9 cellsInsulin contentFractional secretionBasal (0.1 mm glucose)With 20 mmglucoseng/mg protein%/2 hDay 4 control1760 ± 2034.0 ± 0.417.0 ± 3.4 (3.3)Day 4 EB-treated3520 ± 50815.1 ± 2.136.6 ± 3.6 (1.4)Day 6 control2420 ± 3812.1 ± 0.533.5 ± 5.0 (15.2)Day 6 EB-treated3720 ± 124525.8 ± 1.526.1 ± 1.6 (0.0)βHC9 cells were plated in a 12-well dish at a density of 3 × 104/cm2 and cultured overnight, and then 0.4 μg/ml EB was added.

To examine the effects of EB treatment on glucose responsiveness in more detail, we evaluated the concentration-response characteristics of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after 6 days of EB treatment. As shown in Fig. 6 and Table II, increase in basal secretion and decrease in stimulated release both contributed to the loss of -fold increase by the treatment. Fig. 6 also shows that half-maximal effect of glucose on insulin secretion was achieved at 10–15 mm.

Despite detailed and extensive studies of the mechanisms of lymphocyte extravasation, remarkably little is known about the expression and regulation of metalloproteinases involved in the migratory process. By using zymography and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments, we have demonstrated that Epstein-Barr virus-immortalized B lymphocytes are able to secrete a 92-kDa metalloproteinase with gelatinolytic activity which has been purified and identified as being MMP-9. Moreover, the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase was shown to be constitutively expressed by the B cells. The expression of 92-kDa gelatinase is mediated by cytokines, growth factors, lipopolysaccharide, concanavalin A, and the tumor promotor phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Time dependence activity increased rapidly up to 24 h of incubation with lipopolysaccharide or concanavalin A stimulation while it requires a delay and more time to have an optimum effect when cytokines were the stimulating agents; transforming growth factor-β abolished 92-kDa gelatinase production. Both staurosporine and wortmannin are inductive stimuli, and the level of MMP-9 secreted into the media is greater than that observed with other agents except concanavalin A. Elicitation of the chemotactic migration of B cells through a model basement membrane by lipopolysaccharide was shown to be correlated with gelatinase expression and inhibited by 7 mm captopril. Our study indicates that Epstein-Barr virus-B lymphocytes express 92-kDa gelatinase, the production of which can be modified by a variety of physiological and pharmacological signals which have been shown to differ according to the cell type.

Cells of the immune system must invade the surrounding tissue in order to reach the site of inflammation. High endothelial venules are specialized postcapillary venules that are found in lymphoı̈d tissues which support high levels of lymphocyte extravasation from the blood (1Girard J.P. Springer T.A. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 449-457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The movement of lymphocytes from the circulation into the tissues requires that cells traverse the capillaries, penetrate the basement membrane, and migrate into the stroma. The basement membrane is a major barrier to leukocyte extravasation, which necessitates the proteolytic cleavage of components, including collagens (predominantly type IV collagen) and glycoproteins such as laminin (2Aumailley M.

From the four subclasses of this important protease family, gelatinase A (72 kDa, type IV collagenase, MMP-2, EC 3.4.24.24) and gelatinase B (92 kDa, type IV collagenase, MMP-9, EC 3.4.24.35) have been reported as being active in the cleavage of all types of denatured collagens, type IV and type V collagens in their native forms, elastin, and other matrix proteins (3Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 8Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3087) Google Scholar, 9Werb Z. Alexander C.M. Kelley W.N.

Gelatinases A and B are the products of distinct genes and are regulated differently (4Powel W.C. Matrisian L.M. Gunthert U. Shlag P.M. Birchmeier W. Attempts to Understand Metastasis Formation. Springer Verlag, New York1996: 1-21Google Scholar). Their expression can be modulated by soluble mediators such as growth factors, cytokines, oncogenes, and tumor promotors (3Matrisian L.M. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar, 11Mauviel A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 12Ries C. Petrides P.E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 345-355PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation depends on coordinated increases in transcription, secretion, proteolytic activation or TIMP inactivation, and, in some instances, association of the activated forms with cell surfaces (7Owen C.A. Campbell E.J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 367-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,13Chen W.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 802-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and T cells all produce and secrete MMPs with a cell-specific pattern for induction and control of MMP expression, and functional roles in the mediation of immunity and inflammation (14Goetzl E.J. Banda M.J. Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar). Gelatinase A is the most widely distributed MMP, being produced constitutively by many cell types in culture, particularly fibroblasts (14Goetzl E.J. Banda M.J. Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (15Zaoui P. Barro C. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Gelatinase B can also be secreted by mesenchymal cells in culture, after induction by cytokines or other agents, but it is a major product of monocytes, macrophages, T lymphocytes, and tumor cells (14Goetzl E.J. Banda M.J. Leppert D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1-4PubMed Google Scholar, 16Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is also found packaged in a granule fraction in polymorphonuclear neutrophils and is released upon neutrophil stimulation (17Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Hibbs M.S. Glauert A.H. The Control of Tissue Damage. Elsevier Science, New York1988: 139-147Google Scholar, 18Morel F. Dewald B. Berthier S. Zaoui P. Dianoux A.C. Vignais P.V. Baggiolini M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Despite detailed and extensive studies of the secretion of gelatinase B by infiltrating neutrophils and much speculation about the mechanisms of their extravasation (17Mainardi C.L. Hasty K.A. Hibbs M.S. Glauert A.H. The Control of Tissue Damage. Elsevier Science, New York1988: 139-147Google Scholar), little is known about the involvement of MMPs in the migratory process of immune cells such as lymphocytes. It has been reported that normal T lymphocytes contain both gelatinase A and gelatinase B, which may induce basement membrane turnover by a different regulatory process (5, 19- 22). Here, for the first time, we describe the expression and regulation of gelatinase B in human B lymphocytes. p-aminophenylmercuric acetate base pair(s) bovine serum albumin concanavalin A Epstein-Barr virus interleukin lipopolysaccharide matrix metalloproteinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TGF, transforming growth factor tumor necrosis factor fast protein liquid chromatography enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. p-aminophenylmercuric acetate base pair(s) bovine serum albumin concanavalin A Epstein-Barr virus interleukin lipopolysaccharide matrix metalloproteinase phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis TGF, transforming growth factor tumor necrosis factor fast protein liquid chromatography enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

Lymphocytes from heparinized sterile venous blood were prepared by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation. The cells were infected with the B95-8 strain of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as described previously (23Cohen-Tanugi L. Morel F. Pilloud-Dagher M.C. Seigneurin J.M. François P. Bost M. Vignais P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The EBV B lymphocyte cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The culture was maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2atmosphere. The medium was changed twice weekly. Before MMP expression and after extensive washing, the EBV B lymphocytes were grown in serum-free medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and were maintained under the same CO2atmosphere for 18 h until further use. Cell viability was monitored by the trypan blue exclusion method; it was of the order of 90%. All the experiments were standardized by using an equal number of cells. Secreted gelatinase B was purified from 0.8 nm PMA-stimulated human neutrophils as described previously (24Morel F. Berthier S. Guillot M. Zaoui P. Massoubre C. Didier F. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, released proteins were fractionated by DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange chromatography and affinity chromatography on gelatin agarose. Fractions containing gelatinase activity were pooled and processed using preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (5–15% gel). A 92-kDa band corresponding to the native neutrophil gelatinase was electroeluted and injected into rabbits for antibody production. Purified gelatinase (50 μg/0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline) was mixed with 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant and injected into rabbits. Booster injections using Freund's incomplete adjuvant were started on day 15 and repeated every 2nd week for 2 months. Blood was collected 2 weeks after the last booster and allowed to clot. Antisera were separated by centrifugation and stored at −20 °C. Serum immunoglobulins were pelleted down twice with 33–40% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and filtered through a DEAE-cellulose matrix to eliminate plasma α2-macroglobulin. Immunoglobulins G (IgG) were further isolated onto protein A-Sepharose. The specificity of antisera and immunoglobulins with respect to binding and inhibition has been reported previously (24Morel F. Berthier S. Guillot M. Zaoui P. Massoubre C. Didier F. Vignais P.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A metalloproteinase with gelatinolytic activity, from crude EBV B lymphocyte culture medium supernatant, was purified using substrate affinity chromatography on gelatin agarose, and gel filtration on FPLC Superose 12. Approximately 40 ml of serum-free, conditioned medium (108EBV B lymphocytes) was dialyzed against 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, buffer containing 0.005 m CaCl2, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35. The dialyzed medium was applied to a gelatin agarose column that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. After extensive washing with equilibration buffer containing 1 m NaCl, the bound enzyme was eluted with 10% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide, which was added to the latter buffer. Fractions with zymographically determined gelatinolytic activity were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration through Centricon 10, and applied to a Superose 12 column prepared in 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 8, buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl and 0.05% (v/v) Brij 35. The fractions were collected by FPLC, at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min at a pressure of 1 MPa. Eluates showing gelatinolytic activity were pooled and frozen until further use. Cell migration was quantified using Transwell inserts as described previously (5Leppert D. Waubant E. Galardy R. Bunnett N.W. Hanser S.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4379-4389PubMed Google Scholar). 106 EBV B lymphocytes in 0.5 ml of serum-free culture medium containing 0.2% (w/v) BSA were added to the 12-mm diameter inserts of Transwell chambers over 12-μm pore polycarbonate filters with a continuous even coating of 100 μl of growth factor reduced Matrigel® matrix, which separated the cells from 1.5 ml of the same medium in the lower compartment. In this experiment, EBV B cells were preincubated with 10 ng/ml LPS at 37 °C for 18 h in the 0.2% BSA serum-free medium and then added to the upper compartment of the insert. The Transwell chambers were incubated in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C for 24 h. In some experiments, different concentrations of captopril were added to the two compartments. Cells in the lower compartment were detached by shaking and collected for counting. Proteins were separated in parallel with appropriate controls and molecular weight markers using SDS-PAGE (25Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) in 10% (w/v) acrylamide gel with a 5% (w/v) stacking gel, and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Nitrocellulose transfer of proteins separated by SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method described by Towbin et al. (26Towbin U.K. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). After this, the blotting membranes were incubated with specific antiserum raised against neutrophil-purified gelatinase (1:200 dilution) in 0.05m Tris-HCl, 0.2 m NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.5, followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:1000 dilution in the same buffer), and stained with nitro blue tetrazolium 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate reagent, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Zymographic analysis was carried out in 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing gelatin (0.5 mg/ml), as described previously (15Zaoui P. Barro C. Morel F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1290: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 16Murphy G. Crabbe T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The proteins collected from conditioned medium or chromatography eluates were concentrated using Centricon 10. They were applied to the gel in a sample buffer containing 2.3% (w/v) SDS but lacking β-mercaptoethanol and were not boiled prior to loading. The gels were washed twice for 15 min in 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 0.005 m CaCl2, 0.001 mm ZnCl2, and 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, in order to remove SDS, followed by 5-min washes in buffer devoid of Triton X-100. After 3.5 h of incubation at 37 °C with 0.001m APMA in the same buffer, containing 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 and destained as described previously (27Woessner J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 510-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Zones of enzymatic activity were shown by negative staining and quantitated by scanning densitometry at 600 nm (CD 60, Desaga, Sarstedt Gruppe). Enzyme activity was expressed in arbitrary units from a standard curve corresponding to the gelatin zymography of increasing concentrations of latent purified gelatinase B (27Woessner J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 510-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Protein content was estimated using the micro BCA method (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18586) Google Scholar). TIMP-1 was measured by using a two-site ELISA “sandwich” format (ELISA system, code RPN 2611, Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Standards (purified TIMP-1, Amersham Life Science, Inc.) and samples (flow-through from gelatin agarose matrix and culture medium) were incubated with anti-TIMP-1 antibody. The TIMP-1 was detected by a conjugate (peroxidase-labeled antibody to TIMP-1); the reaction was then quantitated as indicated by the manufacturer's instruction. The concentration of TIMP-1 in a sample was determined by interpolation from a standard curve. Total RNA was isolated (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar) from about 108 EBV B lymphocytes, using a modification of the single-step method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63148) Google Scholar), involving 5-min incubation of the total cell pellets with 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent. The cell pellets were disrupted by repetitive push-pull through a 1-ml Pipetman tip. Cell lysates were transferred to RNase-free sterile Eppendorf tubes, and RNA was extracted over 0.2 ml of chloroform by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). RNA was precipitated from the supernatant phase with 0.5 ml of isopropyl alcohol and washed in 70% (v/v) ethanol. The optical density of RNA resuspended in sterile water was recorded (A260 nm/280 nm ratio >1.8–2.0). The yield from this procedure varied between 50 and 200 μg of total RNA. Aliquots of 5 μg of total RNA were reverse-transcribed in 20 μl of RT buffer, using oligo(dT) primers and a cDNA synthesis kit used according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA (2.5 μl per test) was immediately amplified by PCR, using 2.5 units ofTaq polymerase in 100 μl (final volume) of Taqbuffer containing 0.2 mm dNTP and 0.25 μmsense and antisense oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides used as primers were synthesized from the timp-1, mmp-9 gene sequences of the EMBL cDNA library as follows. MMP-9 (92-kDa gelatinase) primers, sense 5′-116–136 bp/antisense 5′-392–372 bp were designed to amplify a 277-bp cDNA fragment; TIMP-1 primers: sense 5′-1–18 bp/antisense 5′-769–746 bp (769-bp complete cDNA) (TableI). Thirty-five cycles (denaturation, 1 min at 94 °C; annealing, 1 min at 57 °C for MMP-9, at 60 °C for TIMP-1; extension, 2 min at 72 °C) followed by a 7-min elongation period were performed with a M J Research PTC 150 thermocycler with Peltier effect. Commercial actin primers were run in parallel PCR tests as a control for PCR and RNA extraction efficiency. Aliquots of 10 μl of PCR products in bromphenol blue solution were run together with a scale of DNA ladders (markers VI, Boehringer Mannheim, France) on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gels containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The bands were photographed using Polaroid film and UV transillumination.Table IComposition of oligonucleotide primersOligoprimersSequencePositionTm°CMMP-9 Oligo sense5′-GGAGACCTGAGAACCAATCTC-3′+11664 Oligo antisense5′-TCCAATAGGTGATGTTGTCGT-3′+39260TIMP-1 Oligo sense5′-GGCCATCGCCGCAGATCC-3′+162 Oligo antisense5′-GCTGGGTGGTAACTCTTTATTTCA-3′+76968Positions of the 5′-ends of the primers are numbered from the ATG inhibition codon of the MMP-9 or TIMP-1 gene.

The MMP-9 gelatinase primers and TIMP-1 primers correspond to cDNA fragments of 277 and 769 bases, respectively. PCR products were gel-purified and automatically sequenced by Genome Express Ltd., Grenoble, France, with forward and backward primers for TIMP-1 and MMP-9. 24 h after addition of 0.5 nm PMA, 1 μg/ml concanavalin A, or 10 ng/ml LPS, total RNA was extracted from EBV B lymphocytes by the TRIzolTMmethod as described previously. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated onto an oligo(dT) cellulose matrix by rocking total RNA with oligo(dT) cellulose in a high salt buffer (400 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.4) for 2–3 h at room temperature and elution of mRNA with a buffer with no salt (5 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.4). After denaturation at 65 °C for 15 min, poly(A)+ RNA from control or test samples was size-fractionated on a 1% (w/v) agarose-formaldehyde gel in 1× MOPS buffer, blotted onto a positive nylon membrane in 10× SSC (1.5m NaCl, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7) by capillary action and immobilized by UV cross-linking using a UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The 277-bpmmp-9 PCR product was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim, France) by PCR with the same oligonucleotide primers as those used before and hybridized to the filter overnight at 42 °C in a high SDS buffer (7% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide, 5× SSC, 2% (w/v) blocking reagent, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7, 0.1% (w/v) N-lauroylsarcosine). The membrane was washed twice in 2× SSC with 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice in 0.1× SSC with 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 50 °C for 15 min. The detection was performed using anti-digoxigenin (Fab) fragments conjugated to alkaline phosphatase followed by a chemiluminescent reaction using the CDP-Star system (Boehringer Mannheim, France), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chemiluminescent signals were detected by exposing the blot onto Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Life Science, Inc.) for 10 min. The integrity and equal gel loading of mRNA were assessed by visualizing the remaining 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA bands under UV light after staining with ethidium bromide and by a second hybridization of the membrane with a digoxigenin-labeled probe of the housekeeping g3pdh gene. Quantitation (ratio mRNA for gelatinase B/mRNA for G3PDH) was performed by scanning densitometry at 400 nm of the bands of MMP-9 and G3PDH seen on x-ray films (CD 60, Desaga, Sarstedt Gruppe). The variations are expressed as mean ± S.E.; p values were calculated by Student's paired t test. Human B cells were isolated from peripheral blood, transformed by Epstein-Barr virus, and cultured in vitro as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We analyzed EBV B lymphocytes for metalloproteinase activity secreted into the culture-conditioned medium. Because of low levels of expression, the isolation of a metalloproteinase with gelatinolytic activity was carried out onto a gelatin agarose matrix (Fig. 1 A). Analysis of the eluates by gelatin zymography (Fig. 1 A, inset) revealed that proenzyme was present in eluates 11–15, which were recovered from the gelatin affinity chromatography once dimethyl sulfoxide was added to the NaCl washing buffer; maximum gelatinolytic activity occurred in fractions 12 and 13 in both the control experiment and after treatment of the cells with 0.5 nm PMA. Treatment with PMA induced a high level of secretion of the gelatinolytic enzyme compared with the control. Similar results were observed with untransformed B lymphocytes (not shown). Metalloproteinases are known to be secreted as latent precursors of higher molecular weight than the mature enzyme. 1.8 mm APMA induced the conversion of the proenzyme to active forms (Fig. 1B, lane 1 (latent) andlane 2 (active)), yielding gelatinolytically active products at 78 and 71 kDa molecular masses. 10 mm EDTA completely inhibited the activity of all the gelatinases (Fig. 1 B,lane 3 (latent) and lane 4 (active)). The inhibition of gelatinolytic activity by EDTA indicated that the enzyme displays the characteristics of a metalloproteinase. Gelatinase-free TIMP-1 was recovered in the flow-through of the gelatin agarose chromatography during the isolation of 92-kDa gelatinase, as shown in Fig. 1 A. TIMP-1 was quantitated using ELISA, giving a 94% recovery of TIMP-1 (flow-through versus culture medium). The 92-kDa gelatinase isolated on gelatin agarose was purified by FPLC gel filtration chromatography (not shown). The eluates which show gelatinolytic activity were pooled and processed using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 1, C and D). About 10 ng of purified gelatinase were isolated from 196 ml of serum-free conditioned medium of 8 × 108 EBV B lymphocyte culture in a purification process which yielded a 471-fold purified protein. The final material ran as a major 90-kDa band on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1 C, lane 2). Western blot analysis of the purified protein with a polyclonal antibody specific for neutrophil MMP-9 labeled a protein of molecular mass in the range of 90 to 94 kDa (Fig. 1 D). This corresponds to the 92-kDa protein with gelatinolytic activity detected by zymography (Fig. 1 A, inset). Additional confirmation that the enzyme was indeed gelatinase B (MMP-9) was obtained by detection of specific mRNA by PCR. Total RNA was extracted from EBV B lymphocytes (108 cells) and 5 μg of total RNA were subjected to RT and amplification by PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig.2, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 PCR products were clearly o"

The complete folylpoly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidase cDNA was isolated from a pig jejunal cDNA library using an amplified homologous probe incorporating primer sequences from prostate-specific membrane antigen, a protein capable of folate hydrolysis. The cDNA encodes a 751-amino acid polypeptide homologous to prostate-specific membrane antigen and rat brain N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase. PC3 transfectant membranes exhibited activities of folylpoly-γ-carboxypeptidase and N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase, while immunoblots using monoclonal antibody to native folylpoly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidase identified a glycoprotein at 120 kDa and a polypeptide at 84 kDa.

Chem. 1986; 261: 928-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) purified folylpoly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidase (FGCP) 1The abbreviations used are: FGCPfolylpoly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidaseNAALADaseN-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidasePSMprostate-specific membrane antigenNAAGN-acetylated aspartylglutamateGCP IIglutamate carboxypeptidase III100ileal 100-kDa proteinDPP IVdipeptidyl peptidase IVGHglutamate hydrolaseRFCreduced folate carrier proteinFBPfolate-binding proteinTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycinebpbase pair(s)kbkilobase pair(s). from human jejunal brush-border membranes as a zinc-activated exopeptidase that releases terminal glutamates sequentially and is stable at pH greater than 6.5. We identified a separate intracellular lysosomal carboxypeptidase in human jejunal mucosa that cleaves folylpoly-γ-glutamates with an endopeptidase mode of action at a pH optimum of 4.5 and that is distinguished from membranous FGCP by its complete inhibition byp-hydroxymercuribenzoate (3Wang T.T.Y. Chandler C.J. Halsted C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13551-13555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments detected the two separate folate hydrolases in intracellular and brush-border membrane fractions of pig jejunal mucosa, each with properties identical to those found in human jejunum (4Chandler C.J. Wang T.T.Y. Halsted C.H. Cooper B.A. Whitehead V.M. Chemistry and Biology of Pteridines. Walter de Gruyter & Co., New York1986: 539-542Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody Mab-3 to the purified pig jejunal brush-border FGCP detected a 120-kDa subunit protein that was localized by immunoreactivity to the jejunal brush-border site of in vivo hydrolysis of folylpoly-γ-glutamates (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar). folylpoly-γ-glutamate carboxypeptidase N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase prostate-specific membrane antigen N-acetylated aspartylglutamate glutamate carboxypeptidase II ileal 100-kDa protein dipeptidyl peptidase IV glutamate hydrolase reduced folate carrier protein folate-binding protein N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine base pair(s) kilobase pair(s). Attempts at molecular characterization of pig jejunal FGCP were facilitated by the recent and serendipitous descriptions of the molecular properties of two other proteins, human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSM) and rat brain N-acetylated α-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALADase). The cDNAs encoding these two proteins demonstrate 87% nucleotide and 85% amino acid sequence identity (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar, 7Bzdega T. Turi T. Wroblewska B. She D. Chung H.S. Kim H. Neale J.H. J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 9Carter R.E. Feldman A.R. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Others found that PC3 cells transfected with the human PSM cDNA are capable of hydrolysis of folylpoly-γ-glutamate (10Pinto J.T. Suffoletto B.P. Berzin T.M. Qiao C.H. Lin S. Tong W.P. May F. Mukherjee B. Heston W.D.W. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 1445-1451PubMed Google Scholar) with an exopeptidase activity mechanism similar to that previously described for human jejunal FGCP (2Chandler C.J. Wang T.T.Y. Halsted C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 928-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery that the hydrolysis of both NAAG and folylpoly-γ-glutamate can be attributed to the same molecule (PSM) led to the recommendation that human PSM and rat brain NAALADase be identified under a single IUBMB-approved name (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), subsequently designated glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP II; EC 3.4.17.21). The goals of the present study were to characterize the molecular structure of pig jejunal FGCP while exploring its potential genetic and biological similarities to human PSM and rat NAALADase. We found extensive molecular homology and overlapping catalytic capabilities among pig FGCP, human PSM, and rat NAALADase, consistent with the concept that the three proteins represent varied expressions of the same gene in different species and tissues. The original discovery of the pig FGCP gene provides a molecular framework for future studies on the biological relationships among these proteins and on the integration of jejunal folate hydrolysis within the overall process of the intestinal absorption of dietary folates. The SuperScript preamplification system was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Taq DNA polymerase was purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 mCi/mmol) and [α-35S]dATP (1000 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. A cDNA probe for human actin was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). N-Acetylaspartyl-[3,4-3H]glutamate (41.8 Ci/mmol) and α-[32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. AG 1-X8 anion exchange resin (200–400-mesh, formate form) was purchased from Bio-Rad. 2-(Phosphonomethyl)pentanedioic acid was a gift of Dr. Barbara Slusher, Guilford Pharmaceuticals (Baltimore, MD). Folyl-γ-Glu-γ-[14C]Glu was available as a prior gift from Dr. C. Krumdieck (University of Alabama Birmingham). Purified native pig jejunal FGCP and its monoclonal antibody Mab-3 were available at −70 °C from our previous experiment (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide-N-glycosidase F was purchased from Oxford Glyco Sciences (Bedford, MA). All other reagents were obtained from Sigma, Fisher, and various other commercial sources. Fresh jejunal and ileal mucosal scrapings were obtained from market pigs within 5 min of killing at the University of California (Davis, CA) slaughterhouse and were immediately washed in ice-cold saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. They were then used for the preparation of brush-border membranes that were purified >20-fold according to appropriate marker enzymes and our previously described procedure (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar). For subsequent RNA and poly(A+) RNA preparations, portions of pig liver; renal cortex; and duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Human jejunal segments of ∼2-cm length were obtained fresh in the operating room from obese patients undergoing elective gastric bypass surgery with gastrojejunal anastomosis, according to acceptable use exemption from the University of California Davis Human Subjects Committee. Segments were opened longitudinally and were washed immediately in ice-cold 4m guanidium thiocyanate prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen and storage at −70 °C. Tumor cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). PC3 cells were grown in MEM supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin; LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with nonessential amino acids, 5% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All media reagents were obtained from Life Technologies. As described previously, FGCP was purified from pig jejunal brush-border membranes, and the major subunit protein was identified at 120 kDa by denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot with Mab-3 monoclonal antibody (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar). A parallel gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, and the single 120-kDa band was electroeluted using the Amicon Centrilutor system (12Matsudaira P A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification and Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). A peptide digest was prepared by overnight incubation of the eluate with a 50-fold molar excess of cyanogen bromide in 70% formic acid. The resultant peptide fragments were separated on a 7.5% Tricine gel and blotted to ProBlott membranes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Peptide sequencing followed the Edman reaction, and amino acids were identified by high performance liquid chromatography (12Matsudaira P A Practical Guide to Protein and Peptide Purification and Microsequencing. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1989Google Scholar). Two peptide sequences contained the sequences KILIARYGKI and LTKELQ, which were 80 and 83% identical to the sequences KIVIARYGKV and LTKELK in the amino acid sequence of human PSM, respectively (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding PSM nucleotide sequences encoding these peptides (594–624 and 1428–1446 bp (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar)) were used to design sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers for the polymerase chain reaction. Approximately 10 μg of total RNA was extracted from pig jejunal mucosa using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies) (13Chirgwin J.J. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript preamplification system (Life Technologies) (14Wang A.M. Doyle M.V. Mark D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9717-9721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1619) Google Scholar). Following a polymerase chain reaction with the described primers, the amplified product was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). A subsequent dideoxy chain termination reaction (15Sanger F. Nicklen S Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) identified a cDNA sequence of 853 bp that had 87% nucleotide identity to the corresponding region of PSM (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 10 μg of poly(A+) RNA was prepared from pig jejunal mucosal RNA by the FastTrak 2.0 poly(A+) RNA isolation system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) (16Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar) and was used for custom construction of a pig jejunal mucosal cDNA library in λZAP by Stratagene Cloning Systems, with a yield of 1.1 × 1010 plaque-forming units/ml. The cDNA library was probed with the amplified 853-bp cDNA fragment using established screening methods (17Benton W.D. Davis R.W. Science. 1977; 196: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2924) Google Scholar), and positive plaques were purified by secondary and tertiary screening. Following in vivoexcision and agarose gel electrophoresis, six purified cDNA clones of different sizes between 1.6 and 2.5 kb were identified by Southern analysis using the 853-bp cDNA probe. Both strands from each clone were sequenced completely by the dideoxy chain termination reaction using the T3 or T7 polymerase vector primer sequences (15Sanger F. Nicklen S Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52678) Google Scholar) and by primer walking using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers that were constructed from bases −8 to −5, 203–223, 590–605, 822–836, 948–962, 1237–1251, 1526–1540, 1847–1861, and 2078–2092 (sense) and from bases 284–303, 544–558, 786–800, 1110–1115, 1456–1470, 1645–1660, 1988–2001, and 2237–2245 (antisense). The full cDNA sequence was confirmed independently by cycle sequencing of each clone using the LI-COR 4200 automated sequencer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). Clone 7 incorporated all sequences represented in the others, except for an additional 46 bp in the 5′-untranslated region of clone 10 and 25 bp in the 3′-untranslated region of clone 4. No additional sequences were detected in the 5′-untranslated region by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (18Frohman M. Dush M. Marin G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9002-9889Google Scholar). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities among pig FGCP, human PSM (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar), rat NAALADase (7Bzdega T. Turi T. Wroblewska B. She D. Chung H.S. Kim H. Neale J.H. J.

Sci. 1998; 95: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and other relevant proteins were analyzed by the BESTFIT and PILEUP programs of version 9.1 of the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package (Madison, WI). A construct of the cDNA of FGCP was prepared by HindIII andXbaI excision from the vector, followed by ligation into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). One hundred-mm dishes of PC3 cells were transfected with 25 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA containing the cDNA of pig FGCP or human PSM (construct PSMA2) (9Carter R.E. Feldman A.R. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 749-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) using the calcium phosphate-mediated method in 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.05 (19Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6495) Google Scholar). Mock transfected PC3 cells served as controls. Cells were harvested 72 h post-transfection for enzymatic assays by scraping them into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4 at 37 °C). Membranes were prepared from the transfected and control PC3 cells by brief sonication followed by centrifugation (35,000 × g) for 30 min. The membrane pellets were then solubilized by sonication into 50 mmTris-HCl plus 0.5% Triton X-100. The protein concentration of the solubilized membrane was determined using the enhanced protocol BCA assay (Pierce) or Bio-Rad kit. The hydrolysis of NAAG was measured in purified pig jejunal and ileal brush-border membranes and in transfected and mock transfected PC3 cell membranes by radioenzymatic assay, whereby hydrolysis was quantitated via scintillation spectrometry of [3H]glutamate produced from radiolabeled substrate after separation of substrate and product by ion exchange chromatography (20Robinson M.B. Blakely R.D. Couto R. Coyle J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14498-14506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were initiated by the addition of labeled NAAG at a concentration of 2.5 nm. Folate hydrolysis was measured in membranes from PSM and FGCP transfectants and mock transfected PC3 cells using substrate folyl-γ-Glu-γ-[14C]Glu and a modification (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar) of the method of Krumdieck and Baugh (21Krumdieck C.L Baugh C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 35: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) in which terminal [14C]Glu is counted in a liquid scintillation counter after charcoal precipitation of unreacted substrate. Duplicate reactions used 12 μm substrate in 33 mm3,3-dimethylglutarate buffer containing 0.1 mm zinc acetate. Initial studies evaluated pH dependence and the inhibitory effect of 0.5 mm p-hydroxymercuribenzoate in membranes from each cell preparation. Subsequently, kinetic properties were compared in membranes from purified pig jejunal brush borders and from FGCP and PSM transfectants by measurements over a range of substrate concentrations at pH 6.5. Membranes from the PC3 cells that were transfected with the cDNA of either human PSM or pig FGCP or that were mock transfected were solubilized in 0.1% Triton X-100. Membrane proteins from the FGCP transfectant were deglycosylated under denaturing conditions using peptide-N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's protocol. Solubilized membrane proteins and a sample of purified native pig jejunal brush-border FGCP (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar) were electrophoresed in parallel on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar), followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Marlborough, MA). Protein bands were identified using the monoclonal antibody Mab-3 to the purified native pig FGCP (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar) followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad). The authenticity of Mab-3 immunoreactivity was proven previously by its ability to immunoprecipitate the 120-kDa subunit of FGCP from solubilized pig jejunal brush-border membranes and to localize FGCP in pig intestine immunohistochemically (5Chandler C.J. Harrison D.A. Buffington C.A. Santiago N.A. Halsted C.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G865-G872PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from rat brain, LNCaP cells, and pig and human jejunal mucosa (13Chirgwin J.J. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16654) Google Scholar). Poly(A+) RNA was prepared from pig liver and kidney and duodenal, jejunal, and ileal mucosa (16Aviv H. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (5183) Google Scholar). Human brain poly(A+) RNA was obtained from CLONTECHInc. (Palo Alto, CA). A 2.4-kb EagI–NdeI fragment of FGCP was purified and 32P-labeled for subsequent probing of Northern blots. Pig tissue samples were also probed with a 32P-labeled fragment of human actin cDNA as a positive internal control. After electrophoretic separation in 1.2% agarose, 2.2 m formaldehyde gels and transfer to nylon membranes (Schleicher & Schuell), RNA species were identified by hybridization to cDNA probes as detected autoradiographically (23Sambrook J Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the cDNA of pig FGCP are shown in Fig. 1. The deduced amino acid sequences KILIARYGKIF and MYSLVYNLTKELQ correspond with 100 and 85% identities to two amino acid sequences, KILIARYGKIF and MYILVYGLTKELQ, that were identified in the peptide digest of the native purified enzyme. The complete cDNA of FGCP is composed of 2532 bases: 146 in the 5′-untranslated region, 2253 in the open reading frame that encode 751 amino acids, and 133 in the 3′-untranslated region. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of pig FGCP were compared with those of human PSM (6Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Fair W.R. Heston W.D.W. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 227-230PubMed Google Scholar) and rat NAALADase (7Bzdega T. Turi T. Wroblewska B. She D. Chung H.S. Kim H. Neale J.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 2270-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Luthi-Carter R. Berger U.V. Barczak A.K. Enna M. Coyle J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1998; 95: 3215-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Within the open reading frame, the nucleotide identities between pig FGCP and human PSM and rat brain NAALADase were 88 and 83% respectively, while there was very little similarity in the 5′-untranslated region. The amino acid sequence of pig FGCP was 92% similar and 91% identical to that of human PSM and was 87% similar and 83% identical to that of rat NAALADase (TableI). Structural comparisons followed the recent Rawlings and Barrett analysis of human PSM and rat NAALADase (11Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1339: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy plot (24Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar) of pig jejunal FGCP was identical to those of human PSM and rat NAALADase and typifies a type II protein that conserves a short N-terminal cytoplasmic region and a single hydrophobic transmembrane between residues Trp20 and Ile43. Like human PSM and rat NAALADase, pig FGCP lacks an N-terminal signal sequence but contains positively charged residues at the N-terminal side of the transmembrane domain that are characteristic of type II membrane proteins (25Parks G.D. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1991; 64: 777-787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), while the remainder of the molecule containing the catalytic domain occupies an extracellular site. The putative catalytic domain of human PSM and rat NAALADase is conserved in FGCP between residues 275 and 588. Twelve NX(S/T) potential glycosylation sites occur at Asn positions 51, 77, 122, 141, 154, 196, 337, 460, 477, 614, 639, and 646, of which 10 are conserved by human PSM and nine by rat NAALADase. Five putative catalytic zinc binding residues are conserved at positions His378, Asp388, Glu426, Asp454, and His554. Within the proposed specificity pocket, four positively charged residues are conserved at Arg464, Lys501, Arg537, and Lys546.Table IRegional peptide homologies between pig FGCP and selected proteinsProteinReferenceGenBank™ accession No.FGCP regionSimilarityIdentity%%Human PSM6Israeli R.S.

Unlike many extracellular signaling molecules, such as the neurotrophins, most neuregulins are synthesized as transmembrane proteins. To determine the functions of the highly conserved neuregulin cytoplasmic tail, a yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify proteins that interact with the 157-amino acid sequence common to the cytoplasmic tails of all transmembrane neuregulin isoforms.This screen revealed that the neuregulin cytoplasmic tail interacts with the LIM domain region of the nonreceptor protein kinase LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1). Interaction between the neuregulin cytoplasmic tail and full-length LIMK1 was demonstrated by in vitro binding and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Transmembrane neuregulins with each of the three known neuregulin cytoplasmic tail isoforms interacted with LIMK1. In contrast, the cytoplasmic tail of TGF-α did not interact with LIMK1. In vivo, neuregulin and LIMK1 are co-localized at the neuromuscular synapse, suggesting that LIMK1, like neuregulin, may play a role in synapse formation and maintenance.

Most of these NRG isoforms are synthesized as transmembrane proteins (see Fig. 1). Full-length transmembrane (TM)-NRG is found on the cell surface of TM-NRG-expressing cells (17Burgess T.L. Ross S.L.

Thus, TM-NRG may act both as a juxtacrine (direct cell-cell contact) signaling protein (19Bosenberg M.W. Massagué J. Curr. Opin.

The extracellular epidermal growth factor-like domain of TM-NRGs activates the receptor tyrosine kinases erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4. Most prior NRG studies have focused on the interaction of the NRG extracellular domain with these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the biological consequences of erbB2/erbB3/erbB4 activation by NRG. In contrast, this study focused on the long intracellular region of TM-NRG isoforms (see Fig. 1). The high degree of amino acid sequence conservation of this intracellular region (4Falls D.L. Rosen K.M. Corfas G. Lane W.S. Fischbach G.D. Cell. 1993; 72: 801-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar) suggests that it has important biological functions. Grimm and Leder (22Grimm S. Leder P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) recently reported that one form of the NRG cytoplasmic tail (the b-tail) can activate apoptosis in TM-NRG-transfected HEK 293 cells. Two other potential biological functions of the NRG cytoplasmic tail are regulation of NRG protein trafficking and of proteolytic release of the NRG ectodomain into the extracellular space (see Refs. 13Wen D.Z. Suggs S.V. Karunagaran D. Liu N.L. Cupples R.L. Luo Y. Janssen A.M. Benbaruch N. Trollinger D.B. Jacobsen V.L. Meng S.Y. Lu H.S. Hu S. Chang D. Yang W.N. Yanigahara D. Koski R.A. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell.

Cell. 1997; 8: 1619-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Another intriguing possibility is that transmembrane NRG may function not only as a receptor ligand but also as a receptor and that the NRG cytoplasmic tail mediates outside-in signal transduction. If NRG acts as a “receptor” and the RTKs erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4 are its “ligand,” bi-directional signaling could occur between cells expressing TM-NRG and cells expressing the RTKs erbB2, erbB3, and erbB4. The idea of bi-directional signaling between cells expressing an RTK TM ligand and cells expressing the cognate RTK was first suggested by Pfeffer and Ullrich (25Pfeffer S. Ullrich A. Nature. 1985; 313: 184Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and recent in vivo and in vitro studies of the interaction between the TM ligand LERK-2 and the RTK Nuk (26Henkemeyer M. Orioli D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1640-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) have strongly supported this hypothesis. Thus, several potential biological roles for the cytoplasmic tails of NRG and other RTK TM ligands are supported by experimental evidence; however, no proteins interacting with these cytoplasmic tails have been molecularly identified. As an approach to assessing these potential functions of the NRG cytoplasmic tail and to determine the mechanism by which these functions are carried out, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to isolate brain proteins that interact with the cytoplasmic tail of NRG. We report evidence that the nonreceptor kinase LIMK1 (29Bernard O. Ganiatsas S. Kannourakis G. Dringen R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1159-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 30Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K.

In vivo, NRG and LIMK1 have overlapping expression patterns in the mammalian nervous system, and we show that these proteins are co-localized at the neuromuscular synapse. Although the cellular functions of LIMK1 remain unknown, LIMK1 hemizygosity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the visuospatial constructive cognitive defect of Williams syndrome (33Frangiskakis J.M.

The anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody M2 was purchased from International Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT). All secondary antibodies for Western blot and immunofluorescence experiments were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA). Culture conditions for COS-7 cells were as follows: 37 °C; 8% CO2; medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Plasmid DNA for transfections was purified using Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kits. COS-7 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran. Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were plated in each 100-mm dish 24 h prior to transfection. The DNA transfection solution was prepared by adding 10 μg of plasmid DNA, 30 μl of 50 mg/ml DEAE-dextran (Sigma), and 6 μl of 100 mm chloroquine (Sigma) to 6 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% Nu-Serum (Collaborative Biomedical Products). Cells were rinsed with PBS (Life Technologies, Inc.) or medium without serum and then incubated with DNA transfection solution (6 ml/dish) for 4 h in the incubator. Cells were then shocked with 10% Me2SO in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (6 ml/dish) for 3 min. The Me2SO-containing medium was replaced with normal growth medium, and the dishes were returned to the incubator. Details of plasmid construct structure are provided in the legend to Fig. 2. To make yeast bait constructs, the target sequences (NRG and TGF-α cytoplasmic tails) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were gel purified and subcloned into pBTM116 using the EcoRI andBamHI sites. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the bait proteins are fusions of the LexA DNA binding domain (N-terminally fused) and the bait sequence (C-terminally fused). Myc/pcDNA3.1, a mammalian expression vector designed to express recombinant proteins with an N-terminal Myc tag, was prepared by ligating a Myc-tag encoding cassette into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using the BstXI and NotI sites. The cassette was made by annealing the two oligos, 5′-CTGGATC ATG GGG GAA CAG AAA CTC ATC TCT GAA GAG GAT CTG GC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGC CAG ATC CTC TTC AGA GAT GAG TTT CTG TTC CCC CAT GATCCAGCACA-3′. The same strategy was used to generate flag/pcDNA3.1, a mammalian expression vector designed to produce N-terminally FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins. The FLAG-encoding cassette was prepared by annealing the oligos 5′-GATCCATC ATG GAC TAC AAG GAC GAC GAT GAC AAG G-3′ and 5′-AATTC CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA GTC CAT GATG-3′. This cassette was ligated between theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(+). To create the Myc-tagged full-length LIMK1 construct, a NotI site was introduced into the LIMK1 cDNA immediately upstream of the initiator ATG using a multi-step strategy (details available upon request). This modified LIMK1 cDNA was then ligated into Myc/pcDNA3.1. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the resulting construct encodes a fusion protein with a Myc-epitope tag appended onto the N-terminal end of full-length LIMK1. To create FLAG-tagged NRG cytoplasmic tails, insert sequences from the appropriate yeast two-hybrid bait plasmid (NRGc bait, NRGb bait, or NRGa bait) were ligated into the flag/pcDNA3.1 vector. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the resulting construct encodes a fusion protein (flag-NRGc-tail, flag-NRGb-tail, and flag-NRGa-tail) with a FLAG epitope tag appended onto the N-terminal end of each cytoplasmic tail form. These FLAG-tagged NRG cytoplasmic tail proteins do not include the extracellular or TM domain of NRG and are therefore expected to be soluble cytoplasmic proteins. To make expression vectors for full-length rat NRGs, the cDNAs R22 (NDF β2a; GenBank accession number U02318), R19 (NDF α2b; accession number U02316), and R44 (NDF α2c; accession number U02324) were subcloned into pcDNA3.1(+) using the NotI andEcoRV sites. To generate GST fusion protein constructs, the yeast two-hybrid bait constructs NRGas-bait and NRGc-bait were digested with EcoRI and SalI, and the cytoplasmic tail-encoding fragment was ligated in-frame into the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). All constructs were verified by restriction digestion and by automated dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Western blot analysis confirmed that proteins of the expected size were produced in COS-7 cells transfected with each of the mammalian expression constructs. Expressed TM-NRGs sometimes appeared as a doublet on Western blots, presumably due to heterogeneous glycosylation (cf. Fig. 6 A). The yeast two-hybrid screening reported here employed the bait plasmid pBTM116, the prey plasmid pVP16, and the yeast strain L40 (40Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). The bait construct (NRGc bait) used for screening the library encodes a fusion between the LexA DNA binding domain and the portion of the NRG cytoplasmic tail common to all transmembrane NRGs. The two-hybrid expression library screened was prepared by N. Gekakis and C. Weitz (Harvard University). Each prey plasmid in the library encodes a fusion protein consisting of: 1) a nuclear localization sequence, 2) the VP16 transactivation domain, and 3) the protein encoded by a brain cDNA (see Fig. 2). This library was prepared from mRNA obtained from the brain of a 3-week-old mouse. The first strand cDNA synthesis was random primed to minimize bias toward C-terminal sequences and was size-selected for a length of 300–800 base pairs. This length is sufficient to encompass individual protein domains but, in many cases, may encode only a portion of a protein. The partial-length prey resulting from this size selection may be advantageous in allowing identification of interactions between the bait protein and proteins for which a full-length prey protein would not interact in a two-hybrid assay, either because the full-length protein is membrane-associated or because it contains a regulatory domain that blocks interaction with the bait. The library had 2 × 106 primary recombinants. For screening, library plasmids were transformed into L40 yeast that had previously been transformed with the NRGc bait plasmid. The version of the yeast two-hybrid system used employs two independent reporter genes, HIS3 and LacZ. Colonies that grow on medium lacking histidine and that produce β-galactosidase are considered primary screen positives. Prey plasmids isolated from colonies positive in the primary screen were further tested in a secondary screen: 1) to confirm that the prey plasmid isolated from the initial positive interacts with the NRGc bait, and 2) to test the specificity of the interaction with the NRGc bait. For the specificity control, the candidate prey plasmid was transformed into L40 yeast containing a bait plasmid that encodes the PAS domain of the Drosophila periodic protein PER. This protein sequence has no known similarity to NRG. Only prey showing no interaction with the PER bait were further evaluated. For the β-galactosidase filter assay, colonies of transformed yeast were picked and patched in triplicate on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, and lysine. The yeast patches were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters, and the β-galactosidase assay was performed as described elsewhere (40Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). Strength of interaction was scored as described in the legend of Fig. 3. The positive control for this assay was yeast transformed with bait and prey plasmids, which both had an insert encoding the PAS domain of PER, a domain known to strongly self-associate (42Huang Z.J. Edery I. Rosbash M. Nature. 1993; 364: 259-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). For the liquid β-galactosidase assay, yeast transformants were inoculated into 3 ml of medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, uracil, and lysine and grown until A600 = 1.0. The assay was performed as described elsewhere (43Bartel P.L. Chien C.-T. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach.in: Hartley D.A. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase unit activity was calculated using the formula: activity = 1000 ×A420/[(time in min) × (volume of culture in ml) × A600]. The GST expression vector pGEX-4T-1 and GST fusion protein constructs GST-NRGas-tail and GST-NRGc-tail were transformed into the bacterial strain BL21. An overnight culture in 2×YT medium was diluted 1:50 into 50 ml of fresh 2×YT and incubated at 37 °C in a shaking incubator for 90 min. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was then added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, the culture was incubated for an additional 4 h, and then the bacteria were pelleted at 2500 × g. The pellet was washed once with 7 ml of STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The bacteria were resuspended in 5 ml of cold STE containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 15 min. Five hundred microliters of 100 mmdithiothreitol and 1 ml of 10% sarkosyl w/v were added, and the volume was brought to 10 ml with cold STE. The bacteria were lysed by freezing and thawing five times in a dry ice-ethanol bath. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes, and Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 2% v/v. The lysate (≈10 ml) was then incubated with 100 μl of glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were settled by centrifugation at 700 × g, washed four times with PBS and twice with TENT buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5), and used for in vitro binding assays without further treatment. For the in vitro binding assay, COS-7 cells were transfected as described above with the Myc-LIMK1 expression construct. Cells were lysed 60 h after transfection with 400 μl of TENT buffer per 100-mm dish. The cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 700 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. One milliliter of the cell lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (20 μl). The beads were washed three times with TENT buffer and then resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer with dithiothreitol and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. For Western blot analysis, 15 μl of this sample was loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Myc-tagged LIMK1 was detected with antibody 9e10. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min immediately prior to loading on SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Resolved proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore) using a CAPS transfer buffer (10 mm CAPS, 10% methyl alcohol, pH 11) (44). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS buffer (100 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 μg/ml Ab 9e10 (for LIMK1), 0.3 μg/ml Ab 1310 (for NRGs), or 0.5 μg/ml 7D5 (for NRGs) in 5 ml of the blocking solution. The membranes were washed four times with TTBS buffer (100 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5) at room temperature. Bound primary antibodies were visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:50,000 in TTBS) or goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:50,000 in TTBS) and SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate system (Pierce).

The consensus sequence of the “switch II loop” of the myosin family is DIXGFE. In order to determine the functions of each of the conserved residues, alanine scanning mutagenesis was carried out on theDictyostelium myosin II heavy chain gene. Examination ofin vivo and in vitro motor functions of the mutant myosins revealed that the I455A and S456A mutants retained those functions, whereas the D454A, G457A, F458A and E459A mutants lost them. Biochemical analysis of the latter myosins showed that the G457A and E459A mutants lost the basal ATPase activity by blocking of the isomerization and hydrolysis steps of the ATPase cycle, respectively. The F458A mutant, however, lost the actin-activated ATPase activity without loss of the basal ATPase activity. These results are discussed in terms of the crystal structure of the Dictyosteliummyosin motor domain.

These results are discussed in terms of the crystal structure of the Dictyosteliummyosin motor domain. In the Dictyostelium motor domain designated as S1dC (1Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y.

Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), a bound nucleotide is surrounded by three loops whose sequences are highly conserved among the myosin family (2Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar): the P-loop (residues 179–186 of Dictyostelium myosin II) and the two loops in the 50K segment (residues 233–240 and 454–459 ofDictyostelium myosin II) (see Fig. 1 A). One of the loops in the 50K segment (residues 233–240) is homologous to a loop in the switch I region of GTPases judging from the topological similarity (3Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and has the consensus sequence NXNSSRFG (NNNSSRFG in Dictyostelium myosin II). Residues in the loop are aligned along the ATPase pocket, and some of the side chains form hydrogen bonds with the bound nucleotide. The other loop in the 50K segment has the consensus sequence, DIXGFE (DISGFE inDictyostelium myosin II) and is functionally and structurally equivalent to a loop in the switch II region of GTPases (3Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1590-1602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In GTPases, the switch II loop connects the GTPase site and the switch II α-helix, which is part of the effector binding region. Information on the nucleotide state at the GTPase site is transmitted to the effector binding region partially through this switch II loop. In myosin, the switch II loop connects the ATPase pocket and a long conserved α-helix embedded in the lower 50K subdomain (4Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt B.K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M.

Recent x-ray crystallographic studies on Dictyostelium S1dC complexed with various nucleotides and nucleotide analogs revealed that the switch II loop undergoes a significant conformational change during ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 1 B) like the loop in GTPases. When S1dC is complexed with MgADP/Vior MgADP/AlFx (the Vi structure), the switch II loop is closer to the ATPase pocket, although the loop moves away from the ATPase pocket when S1dC is complexed with MgADP/BeFx, MgAMPPNP, MgATPγS, 1The abbreviations used are: MgATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidNTAnitriloacetic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: MgATPγSadenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate)MOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidNTAnitriloacetic acidHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography. or MgADP (the BeFx structure) (5Fisher A.J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11619-11628Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The observed changes in the switch II loop arise from the main chain rotation at the two pivoting residues, Ile-455 and Gly-457. In the Vi structure, Gly-457 and Glu-459 are close to the bound nucleotide. Gly-457 forms a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom of the Vi moiety of the bound MgADP/Vi. Glu-459 coordinates with a water molecule that is expected to attack the bound ATP (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar) and also forms an ionic bond with R238 in such a way as to close the exit (“backdoor”) through which Pi may be released on ATP hydrolysis (8Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; : 44S-47SPubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). In the BeFx structure, however, Gly-457 and Glu-459 are located away from the bound nucleotide. Moreover, the ionic bond between Arg-238 and Glu-459 is broken, and thus the exit is open (Fig.1 B). This conformational change of the loop is accompanied by rigid body motion of the upper and lower 50K subdomains to open and close the 50K cleft. This opening and closure of the cleft may then trigger the swinging of the lever arm, a long α-helix with bound light chains. Thus, the switch II loop of myosin seems to plays a critical role in the conversion of energy derived from ATP hydrolysis into sliding and force generation. adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid nitriloacetic acid high performance liquid chromatography. adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid nitriloacetic acid high performance liquid chromatography. A lower eukaryote, Dictyostelium discoideum, has a single copy of the heavy chain gene of myosin II (9DeLozanne A. Lewis M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Knock-out of this gene generates myosin II-null cells (10Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), which show myosin-specific defects in growth and development. These myosin-specific phenotypic defects can be reversed by introducing a multicopy plasmid bearing the wild-type heavy chain gene of myosin II (11Ruppel K.M. Egelhoff T.T. Spudich J.A. Ann. N. Y.

The effects of mutations were studied by examining the phenotypes of cells expressing the mutant myosins and also by examining the in vitro motor functions of the purified mutant myosins. Each residue from Asp-454 to Glu-459 was changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (22Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar, 23Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4540) Google Scholar) of the Dictyosteliummyosin II heavy chain gene (9DeLozanne A. Lewis M. Spudich J.A. Leinwand L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6807-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mutant myosin heavy chain genes were ligated to the Dictyostelium actin-15 promoter andDictyostelium actin-6 terminator to drive their expression in Dictyostelium cells. They were finally inserted into a multicopy extrachromosomal vector, pBIG (24Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying the mutant myosin heavy chain genes were introduced intoDictyostelium myosin-null cells in which the myosin II heavy chain gene had been knocked out by means of homologous recombination (10Manstein D.J. Titus M.A. De L.A. Spudich J.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 923-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Dictyostelium cells transformed by electroporation were selected in a medium supplemented with 20 μg/ml of G418 on plastic dishes for a week. The transformed cells thus obtained expressed the mutant myosin II molecules. The truncated myosin heavy chain gene corresponding to S1dC (1Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was manipulated as above. The C terminus of S1dC was truncated at Arg-761 by introducing a stop codon at the corresponding location. For easier purification of S1dC, a 6-histidine tag (His6) was attached at the N terminus of S1dC by inserting the corresponding DNA sequence between the start codon and the coding sequence of the myosin heavy chain. The resulting transformation vectors were introduced intoDictyostelium AX2 cells. Random mutagenesis of the 459th residue was carried out by polymerase chain reaction with the E459A mutant myosin gene as a template. The E459A myosin gene was used as the template instead of the wild-type myosin gene to avoid excess representation of the wild-type gene in the library of mutagenized genes. The random representation of codons in the library was directly confirmed by sequencing some clones. A collection of mutant myosin genes was then inserted into a multicopy Dictyosteliumtransformation vector bearing the blasticidin-resistance gene, pBIGBsr (25Sutoh K. Plasmid. 1993; 30: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). By means of electroporation, myosin-null cells were transformed with pBIGBsr-based plasmids bearing myosin genes with all possible codons for the 459th residue. The electroporated cells were cultured overnight and then plated onto agar plates including blasticidin (20 μg/ml) together with Escherichia coli cells. After several days at 22 °C, plaques generated by Dictyostelium cells became visible on the E. coli lawns. Starting from 107 myosin-null cells, 672 plaques were obtained. Two types of plaques were easily distinguishable because of the clear difference in their diameters. Cells were cloned from all of the larger plaques (36 plaques). Plasmid DNA was rescued from randomly chosen clones (20 clones) and then sequenced. The growth rates were measured by determining the numbers of cells cultured in suspension. The incubator was shaken at 150 rpm at 22 °C. Development of the transformed cells was examined on agar plates covered with a lawn ofE. coli cells. Dictyostelium cells (1.2 × 104) were suspended in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and then spotted onto the bacterial lawn. When Dictyosteliumcells had cleared the bacterial cells, they entered the developmental stage. Phosphorylated myosin was prepared as described previously (32Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For experiments involving low concentrations of fluorescent nucleotides (mant-ATP and Cy3-ATP), myosin was purified further to remove the contaminating nucleotides. Myosin eluted from the HPLC column was dialyzed against a solvent comprising 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mmMgCl2 to form filaments. The filaments were collected by centrifugation at 560,000 × g for 30 min and then dissolved in 0.35 m NaCl and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. The wild-type or mutant S1dC bearing an N-terminal histidine tag was extracted from the transformed Dictyostelium cells, and precipitated as an actoS1dC complex by dialysis against a solvent comprising 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2. S1dC was then extracted from the precipitate with a solvent comprising 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl, 7 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm ATP. The extract was directly applied to an NTA-Ni column (Qiagen), an affinity column for histidine-tagged proteins. After washing the column with a column volume of the above solvent containing 1 mm ATP, S1dC was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole, pH 7.4, from 10 mm to 0.5 m. The eluted protein was dialyzed against a solvent comprising 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2. Since the majority of the expressed E459A S1dC remained unbound to F-actin during the formation of actoS1dC, the supernatant obtained on high speed centrifugation of the actoS1dC complex was passed through the NTA-Ni column. The bound E459A S1dC was eluted with imidazole as above. In this alternative way, the major portion of the expressed E459A S1dC was recovered. The amount of E459A S1dC purified with the standard procedure was ∼10% of that of the protein recovered with the alternative procedure. Relative concentrations of the proteins were determined by Coomassie Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce), whereas their exact values were calculated photometrically by the method of Gill and von Hippel (36Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Both methods gave consistent results. Cy3-ATP (1 μm) was added to the wild-type (0.2 μm), G457A (0.5 μm), or E459A (0.5 μm) myosin in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2 at 25 °C. After various times, a part of the reaction mixture was taken out and mixed with a 0.01 volume of PCA to stop the reaction. The resulting solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was applied directly to a reverse-phase HPLC column (Waters, Nova-pack C18). Elution was carried out with 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and 11% acetonitrile. Under these elution conditions, Cy3-ATP and Cy3-ADP were well resolved. Both nucleotides were detected with a fluorimeter. The ratio of the concentrations of Cy3-ATP and Cy3-ADP was calculated to determine the amount of hydrolyzed Cy3-ATP. To compensate for the small amount of Cy3-ADP present in the Cy3-ATP preparation as a contaminant, myosin was first mixed with PCA and then mixed with Cy3-ATP. The resulting solution was treated as above. As for the D454A myosin, reliable measurement of the single turnover of Cy3-ATP was repeatedly hampered by its low yield. All fluorescence measurements were performed with a Perkin-Elmer LS50B Luminescence Spectrophotometer. The binding of mant-ATP to the D454A, G457A, or E459A myosin (0.25 μm) was determined in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 5 mm MgCl2. Under these conditions,Dictyostelium myosin II remained in a soluble state. Since the myosins used for the measurements had lost their ATPase activities, mant-ATP was not hydrolyzed to an appreciable extent during the measurements. The nucleotide concentration was increased by stepwise addition of mant-ATP. The base line was determined using the above solvent without myosin. Fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 440 nm. The actin-S1dC interaction was followed using pyrene-labeled F-actin (0.25 μm) (28Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) and S1dC (0.25 μm) in a solvent comprising 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2. Excitation was at 365 nm and emission at 410 nm. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence spectra were recorded using the wild-type or mutant S1dC (0.5 μm) in a solvent comprising 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, and in the presence and absence of 0.1 mm ATP. Excitation was at 290 nm. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra of completely denatured proteins were also recorded after denaturing them in 6 m GuHCl, and normalized to each other to confirm that observed difference in the tryptophan fluorescence actually arose from different conformations. E459A S1dC purified by the standard or alternative procedure (1 μm) in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, and 2 mm MgCl2 was incubated with 20 μmmant-ATP. The mixture was passed through a gel filtration HPLC column (Ashahipack) equilibrated with a solvent comprising 0.5 mNaCl and 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. The fluorescence intensities of the bound and free mant-ATP (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 440 nm) as well as the absorption of S1dC (at 280 nm) were monitored using two tandemly arranged flow cells. After 2 days of incubation with mant-ATP, the mixture was passed through the gel filtration column to purify the S1dC·mant-ATP complex. At various times after the purification, the purified E459A S1dC·mant-ATP complex was again passed through the column to determine the amount of the fluorescent nucleotide released. Actin-activated and basal MgATPase activities were measured as described (32Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In vitro motility assays were carried out as described (29Kron S.J. Spudich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6272-6276Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 30Toyoshima Y.Y.

When a multicopy plasmid bearing the wild-type heavy chain gene of myosin II was introduced into myosin-null cells, the defect in cytokinesis was reversed so that the resulting transformants (designated as “wild-type cells”) could grow in suspension as mononucleated cells up to the density of ∼2 × 107 cells/ml (Fig. 2,WT). The other transformants expressing the mutant myosins could be grouped into two types according to their behavior in suspension culture (Fig. 2). I455A and S456A cells grew like the wild-type cells, although D454A, G457A, F458A, and E459A cells did not grow or grew only slowly, like myosin-null cells. When transformedDictyostelium cells were allowed to develop on agar plates covered with E. coli cells, the I455A and S456A cells, which grew well in suspension, formed fruiting bodies like the wild-type cells. However, the D454A, G457A, F458A, and E459A cells, which had a defect in suspension culture, could not develop beyond the mound stage, like myosin-null cells. The actin-activated and basal MgATPase activities of the purified myosins were measured (Fig. 3). The D454A, G457A, F458A, and E459A myosins exhibited very low Vmax values for the actin-activated ATPase activity. Among them, the D454A, G457A, and E459A myosins also exhibited very low basal ATPase activities, suggesting that these three mutant myosins had almost completely lost their ability to hydrolyze ATP. In contrast to these myosins, the F458A myosin retained high basal activity similar to that of the I455A or S456A myosin. The Vmax value for the actin-activated MgATPase activity of the F458A myosin was, however, almost the same as that of its basal activity, indicating the complete loss of the actin-activated ATPase activity. The I455A and S456A myosins, which complemented the defects of myosin-null cells, retained their actin-activated and basal ATPase activities. In vitro motility assays were carried out on the purified myosins (Fig. 4). As expected from the phenotypes of cells expressing the mutants, the D454A, G457A, F458A, and E459A myosins could not drive the sliding of actin filaments, whereas the I455A and S456A myosins drove the sliding. As described above, the D454A, G457A, and E459A mutations almost completely abolished the ATPase activity. To determine which step of the ATPase cycle was blocked by the mutations, the binding of mant-ATP to these myosins was measured. Since all these myosins lost their ATPase activities, it was possible to carry out stepwise titration without appreciable hydrolysis of mant-ATP during the measurements. As shown in Fig. 5, the G457A myosin bound mant-ATP tightly, whereas the D454A and E459A myosins bound it more weakly. As shown below, however, it seems that the weak binding of mant-ATP to the E459A myosin was because of the slow binding of the fluorescent nucleotide to the mutant, not to its intrinsically low affinity. These results suggest that the D454A, G457A, and E459A myosins could bind mant-ATP with various affinities, implying that these mutations did not block the ATP binding to the mutant myosins, but blocked the ATP hydrolysis step, like the R238A mutation in the switch I loop (32Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To further investigate the step blocked by the G457A and E459A mutations, the single turnover of the ATPase reaction was followed using a fluorescent ATP analog, Cy3-ATP. As shown in Fig. 6, the wild-type myosin showed an “ADP burst” (∼0.7 mol/mol of ATPase-site), reflecting the quick ATP hydrolysis step followed by the rate-limiting Pirelease step. Unlike the wild-type myosin, the G457A myosin did not show such an “ADP burst” (Fig. 6), indicating that the G457A mutation blocked the ATP hydrolysis step, not the Pirelease step. Similar results were recently reported for smooth muscle myosin (33Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Like the G457A myosin, the E459A myosin did not show an ADP burst (Fig. 6). This result supports, but does not necessarily confirm, that the mutation blocked the hydrolysis step, given the fact that the rate of mant-ATP binding to E459A myosin was unexpectedly slow, as shown below. The ATP-dependent association and dissociation of the Dictyostelium myosin motor domain, S1dC (1Itakura S. Yamakawa H. Toyoshima Y.Y. Ishijima A. Kojima T. Harada Y. Yanagida T. Wakabayashi T. Sutoh K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1504-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), with pyrene-labeled F-actin was studied, the pyrene fluorescence being followed (28Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). S1dC was used mainly because more reproducible data were obtained using this soluble, single-headed fragment. As previously shown, the pyrene fluorescence decreased when the wild-type S1dC formed a rigor complex with the pyrene-labeled actin (34Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the addition of ATP, S1dC was transiently dissociated from the F-actin, and then reassociated with it after ATP had been completely hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi. Thus, the pyrene fluorescence transiently increased and then decreased (Fig. 7 A). F458A S1dC also formed a rigor complex with F-actin in the absence of ATP, as indicated by the decrease in the pyrene fluorescence (Fig. 7 B). The rigor complex was transiently dissociated on the addition of ATP and was formed again after ATP had been exhausted. Complete dissociation of the rigor complex was achieved only when a large excess of ATP was added because F458A S1dC retained high basal ATPase activity and, therefore, quickly consumed ATP. Thus, F458A S1dC exhibited normal ATP-dependent dissociation-association with F-actin even though it had lost its actin-activated ATPase activity. When G457A S1dC was mixed with the pyrene-labeled F-actin in the absence of ATP, a rigor complex was formed, as judged from the decrease in the pyrene fluorescence. On the addition of a small amount of ATP (even 1 mol/mol of S1dC), almost complete dissociation of the rigor complex occurred (Fig. 7 C), indicating that G457A S1dC entered in a weak-binding state when it bound ATP. Because of the lack of ATPase activity, G457A S1dC remained in this weak-binding state. Unlike these mutants, however, E459A S1dC, purified by either the standard or the alternative procedure (see “Experimental Procedures”), failed to form a rigor complex with F-actin even in the absence of ATP, as judged from the fact that the pyrene fluorescence of F-actin never decreased on the addition of the purified S1dC. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of the wild-type S1dC increased on the addition of excess ATP (Fig. 8 A), as previously reported for a similar fragment of Dictyostelium myosin (34Kurzawa S.E. Manstein D.J. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the addition of MgADP, a slight decrease in the fluorescence intensity was observed. Unlike that of the wild-type S1dC, however, the tryptophan fluorescence of G457A S1dC did not change on the addition of ATP or ADP (Fig. 8 B). The fluorescence intensity remained at the same level as that of the wild-type S1dC in the absence of ATP. The tryptophan fluorescence of E459A S1dC also did not respond to ATP or ADP. The fluorescence intensity remained higher than that of G457A S1dC, being similar to that of the wild-type S1dC in the presence of ATP (Fig. 8 B). On the addition of ADP to F458A S1dC, the tryptophan fluorescence slightly decreased, as in the case of the wild-type S1dC (Fig. 8 C). However, on the addition of ATP, the tryptophan fluorescence did not increase, but decreased further (Fig. 8 C), indicating that F458A S1dC took on a unique steady state in the presence of ATP. As mentioned above, the purified E459A S1dC did not form a rigor complex with F-actin. One possibility for this unexpected result is that the E459A mutation induced large conformational changes that made the E459A myosin and S1dC unable to form the rigor complex. Another possibility is that the ATPase site of the E459A mutant was occupied by a tightly trapped endogenous ATP. The latter possibility is much more likely because the intensity of the tryptophan fluorescence of E459A S1dC remained higher than that of G457A S1dC in the presence and absence of ATP, as if it bound ATP or ADP·Pi (35Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). When ATP was tightly trapped at the ATPase site, it would be chased only slowly by the free nucleotide. To test if this was the case, E459A S1dC was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of mant-ATP. After various times, the mixture was passed through a gel filtration HPLC column to separate the bound and free nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 9 A, the amount of the fluorescent nucleotide incorporated into the protein very slowly increased with increasing incubation time. After a week, ∼60% of the protein had incorporated the fluorescent ATP. Thus, it seems that the mant-ATP slowly chased ATP which was tightly trapped at the ATPase site of E459A S1dC and then was bound there. It must be noted that the binding of mant-ATP to other mutants such as G457A S1dC took place within several seconds under the same conditions (data not shown). To further confirm the tight trapping of the bound nucleotide, the rate of release of mant-ATP trapped in E459A S1dC was measured. At various times after the purification, the purified complex of E459A S1dC and mant-ATP was passed through the HPLC column again to separate the bound from the released mant-ATP. As shown in Fig. 9 B, the bound fluorescent nucleotide was only slowly released, confirming the notion that ATP (or its analog) was tightly trapped at the ATPase site of the E459A mutant, once it had been incorporated there. After the incorporation of mant-ATP, E459A S1dC was purified on the gel filtration column as above, and then the bound fluorescent nucleotide was released with 0.1% PCA. When analyzed on a reverse-phase HPLC column, only mant-ATP was detected in the released nucleotide, directly showing that the ATP hydrolysis step was blocked in the E459A S1dC. The 459th residue was randomly mutagenized using the E459A myosin gene as a template. Then the mixture of mutagenized myosin genes was introduced into myosin-null cells. When transformed cells were allowed to grow in the presence ofE. coli cells, they formed two types of plaques that were easily distinguishable from their diameters. The diameter of the larger plaques was ∼2-fold larger than that of the smaller ones, which was almost the same as that of myosin-null cells. Among the 672 plaques generated on the transformation of 107 cells, 36 plaques were of the larger type. The diameter of a plaque is a good indicator of the in vitro motor functions of myosin (20Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1995; 140: 505-515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Patterson B. Spudich J.A. Genetics. 1996; 143: 801-810Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids bearing the myosin genes were retrieved from Dictyosteliumcells isolated from the larger plaques. The sequencing of randomly chosen plasmids thus rescued (20 plasmids) showed that the codon of the 459th residue was either GAG or GAA (14 GAG and 6 GAA), indicating that the 459th residue of a functional myosin must be glutamic acid. Mutant myosins generated by alanine scanning mutagenesis of the switch II loop can be classified into two groups according to theirin vivo phenotypes. One group, comprising the I455A and S456A myosins, fully reverse the myosin-specific defects of myosin-null cells. The other group, comprising the D454A, G457A, F458A, and E459A myosins do not reverse any of the defects. Although I455 is a highly conserved residue in almost all myosins (2Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and functions as a pivoting residue for the main chain rotation of the switch II loop during the transition from the Vi structure to the BeFx structure (5Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the I455A myosin retained most of its motor functions. It must be noted that when the other pivoting residue, G457, was replaced with alanine, the motor functions were completely lost. It seems that the I455A mutation did not block the main chain rotation of the switch II loop, unlike the G457A mutation. Another mutant in the first group, the S456A myosin, exhibited normal motor functions, as expected from the facts that this residue is not conserved among myosins and that alanine occupies this position in some myosins (2Mooseker M.S. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). The mant-ATP titration and single turnover measurements showed that the G457A mutant was unable to hydrolyze ATP because the ATP hydrolysis step (Fig. 10) was blocked. The G457A mutant could bind ATP tightly, however, as judged from the mant-ATP binding to the mutant myosin. Consistent with the result, the actin·G457A S1dC complex was readily dissociated on addition of an equivalent amount of ATP, whereas the tryptophan fluorescence of the mutant S1dC did not change. These results lead us to conclude that G457A S1dC tightly binds ATP and enters in a state (M′·ATP in Fig. 10) distinguishable from the M·ATP or M*·ATP state (35Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The simple collision complex (MATP) is expected to bind ATP much more weakly, and the M*·ATP complex is expected to exhibit more enhanced tryptophan fluorescence than the G457A S1dC·ATP complex. The position of Gly-457 relative to the γ-phosphate of ATP in the ATPase pocket may change on rotation of the main chain of the switch II loop, depending on the state of the nucleotide. Thus, Gly-457 inDictyostelium myosin seems to function like the “γ-phosphate sensor” glycine in GTPases (for example, Gly-60 in Ras). It is likely that the G457A mutation blocked this rotation of the main chain because of steric hindrance. Given the fact that the G457A mutant was trapped before the isomerization step when it bound ATP, it is tempting to speculate that the isomerization step is coupled with the rotation of the main chain of the switch II loop (33Onishi H. Morales M.F. Kojima S. Katoh K. Fujiwara K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3767-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which occurs on the transition from the BeFx structure to the Vistructure, and that G457A S1dC·ATP takes on the BeFx structure. Consistent with this notion, mant-ADP/BeFx was trapped in G457A S1dC, whereas mant-ADP/Vi was not (data not shown). The side chain of Glu-459 is located close to the bound nucleotide in the Vi structure of Dictyostelium S1dC, forming a hydrogen bond with a water molecule suitably positioned to participate in ATP hydrolysis (6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). This strategic location of Glu-459 suggests that the residue is crucial for the hydrolysis step. In fact, the E459A mutant was unable to hydrolyze ATP because the ATP hydrolysis step was blocked (Fig. 10). Once ATP was in the ATPase pocket of the E459A mutant, it was almost irreversibly trapped there without hydrolysis, as observed here. The results suggest that the E459A mutant was trapped possibly at the M*·ATP state (Fig. 10) (35Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Besides its role in ATP hydrolysis, Glu-459 may also play a role as a “gatekeeper” of the backdoor for Pi release (8Yount R.G. Lawson D. Rayment I. Biophys. J. 1995; : 44S-47SPubMed Google Scholar), opening and closing it through the ionic interaction with Arg-238 (Fig.1 B) (32Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This notion implies that ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled with the opening and closing of the backdoor. The crucial importance of Glu-459 was also highlighted by the observation that the motor functions were retained only when glutamic acid occupied the 459th position. The side chain of Asp-454 faces the ATPase pocket, and is coordinated to an Mg ion of the bound nucleotide through a water molecule (5Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar, 6Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Ser-237 in the switch I loop of Dictyostelium myosin is also directly coordinated to the Mg ion from the other side of the ATPase pocket. Unlike the S237A myosin (32Shimada T. Sasaki N. Ohkura R. Sutoh K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14037-14043Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), however, the D454A myosin bound mant-ATP, although weakly, indicating that Asp-454 is of secondary importance in retaining the MgATP in the ATPase pocket, whereas Ser-237 is essential for this. In contrast to the D454A, G457A, and E459A myosins, the F458A myosin in the second group retained the basal MgATPase activity although it completely lost the actin-activated ATPase activity. The observedin vivo defects of the F458A myosin arose from the lack of this essential ability to power the motor. The side chain of Phe-458 points away from the ATPase pocket and is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues such as Asn-472, Asn-475, His-572, Tyr-573, and Ala-574 in the core of the lower 50K subdomain (Fig.1 C). When the main chain of the switch II loop rotates at Gly-457 and Ile-455, the side chain of Phe-458 swings and rotates. It seems that the hydrophobic side chains surrounding Phe-458 follow this motion through the hydrophobic interaction. Thus, the swinging and rotation of Phe-458 seem to trigger the rigid body motion of the lower 50K subdomain, which opens and closes the 50K cleft (5Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Therefore, disruption of the hydrophobic interaction by the F458A mutation blocks some of the structural changes expected to occur during the ATPase cycle, forcing the mutant to bypass some intermediate states. In fact, in the presence of ATP, F458A S1dC was in a unique steady state quite different from M**·ADP·Pi, as judged from the tryptophan fluorescence intensity. The F458A mutant in this unique steady state failed to interact with F-actin in such a way that it stimulated the actin-activated ATPase activity. Further kinetic and structural studies on the F458A myosin would reveal how F-actin triggers the actin-activated ATPase activity. We thank Reiko Ohkura for her excellent technical assistance.

When cells contain sufficient levels of tryptophan to activate TRAP, the protein binds to trpoperon transcripts as they are being synthesized, most often causing transcription termination. However, termination is never 100% efficient, and transcripts that escape termination are subject to translational control. We determined that TRAP-mediated translational control of trpE can occur via a novel RNA conformational switch mechanism. When TRAP binds to the 5′-untranslated leader segment of a trp operon read-through transcript, it can disrupt a large secondary structure containing a portion of the TRAP binding target. This promotes refolding of the RNA such that thetrpE Shine-Dalgarno sequence, located more than 100 nucleotides downstream from the TRAP binding site, becomes sequestered in a stable RNA hairpin. Results from cell-free translation, ribosome toeprint, and RNA structure mapping experiments demonstrate that formation of this structure reduces TrpE synthesis by blocking ribosome access to the trpE ribosome binding site. The role of the Shine-Dalgarno blocking hairpin in controlling translation oftrpE was confirmed by examining the effect of multiple nucleotide substitutions that abolish the structure without altering the Shine-Dalgarno sequence itself.

TRAP binding to the 11 trinucleotide repeats in the nascent trp leader transcript prevents or disrupts formation of an RNA secondary structure, the antiterminator, thereby allowing formation of an overlapping Rho-independent terminator and hence causing termination of transcription before RNA polymerase reaches thetrp structural genes. In the absence of TRAP binding, formation of the antiterminator prevents formation of the terminator, resulting in transcriptional read-through into the trpstructural genes. In addition to regulating transcription of thetrp operon, TRAP also regulates translation oftrpE. Previous in vivo studies demonstrated that TRAP is responsible for regulating trpE translation 10–15-fold (19Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RNA structure predictions of the trpoperon read-through transcript indicated that the most thermodynamically stable conformation of the leader RNA segment would contain a large secondary structure that includes a portion of the TRAP binding site in the 5′-half of the stem. It was proposed that TRAP binding to these repeats would disrupt the large secondary structure and promote refolding of the leader RNA such that the trpESD sequence would be sequestered in an RNA hairpin (19Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that multiple nucleotide substitutions predicted to destabilize the SD blocking hairpin, without altering the SD sequence itself, reduced the ability of TRAP to regulate TrpE synthesis in vivo (25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the ability of TRAP to alter the conformation oftrp operon read-through transcripts could partially explain the TRAP-dependent translational control of trpEexpression that was previously observed (19Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The one unlinked trp gene, trpG, is a part of a folic acid biosynthetic operon (26Slock J. Stahly D.P. Han C.Y. Six E.W. Crawford I.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7211-7226Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of trpG is regulated by a translational control mechanism in which tryptophan-activated TRAP can bind to nine trinucleotide repeats (seven GAG, one UAG, and one AAG) that surround and overlap thetrpG ribosome binding site. TRAP binding to these repeats represses TrpG synthesis by directly blocking ribosome access to thetrpG ribosome binding site (15Yang M. de Saizieu A. van Loon A.P.G.M. Gollnick P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4272-4278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TRAP complexed with l-tryptophan shows that TRAP is composed of 11 identical subunits arranged in a single ring, with one molecule of tryptophan bound between adjacent subunits (23Antson A.A. Otridge J. Brzozowski A.M. Dodson E.J. Dodson G.G. Wilson K.S. Smith T.M. Yang M. Kurecki T. Gollnick P. Nature. 1995; 374: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 27Antson A.A.

The RNA binding motif of TRAP consists of 11 repeated KKR motifs that line the periphery of the TRAP complex. This finding suggests that TRAP-RNA interaction proceeds through a mechanism in which one KKR motif binds to one (G/U)AG repeat, thereby wrapping the RNA around the outside of the TRAP complex (28Yang M. Chen X.-P. Militello K. Hoffman R. Fernandez B. Baumann C. Gollnick P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 696-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed experiments in vitro to elucidate the molecular mechanism responsible for TRAP-mediated translation control of trpE. Our cell-free translation and RNA structural studies demonstrate that TRAP binding to trpoperon read-through transcripts does in fact promote refolding of the untranslated trp leader such that the trpE SD sequence, which is located more than 100 nucleotides downstream from the TRAP binding site, becomes sequestered in a stable RNA hairpin. Moreover, we found that formation of this SD blocking hairpin inhibits TrpE synthesis by blocking ribosome access to the trpEribosome binding site. Plasmid pPB22 carrying the wild type B. subtilis trp promoter and leader (WTtrpL) has been described (20Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The plasmid pINT-SDtrpL contains several trp leader point mutations (SDtrpL) that destabilize the predicted trpE SD blocking RNA hairpin without disrupting the trpE SD sequence itself (25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pHD1 was constructed by subcloning the 730-base pair EcoRI–HindIII fragment containing the SDtrpL from pINT-SDtrpL into theEcoRI–HindIII sites of the pTZ18U polylinker (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). A description of plasmid pTRP-H3B2 has been published (29Henner D.J. Band L. Shimotsu H. Gene ( Amst. ). 1984; 34: 169-177Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). pHD12 was constructed by subcloning the 2.4-kilobase pair PvuII fragment containing the trp operon promoter and leader as well as the trpED structural genes from pTRP-H3B2 into the unique SmaI site of pTZ18U. The plasmid pHD15 contains the WTtrpL, trpE, and the 5′-end of trpD. This plasmid was constructed by simultaneously ligating the 730-base pairEcoRI–HindIII fragment from pPB22 containing the WTtrpL and the 5′-end of trpE, as well as the 1.7-kilobase pair HindIII–BamHI fragment from pHD12 containing the 3′-end of trpE and the 5′-end oftrpD into the EcoRI–BamHI sites of the pTZ18U polylinker. Plasmid pHD16 was constructed in the same manner as pHD15 except that the 730-base pairEcoRI–HindIII fragment containing the SDtrpL from pHD1 was used in place of the WTtrpL. The B. subtilis integration vector, ptrpBG1-PLK, used for the generation of trpE′-′lac translational fusions was described previously (25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pHD22 and pHD24, which contain trpE′-′lacZ translational fusions, were constructed by subcloning the trp leader containingEcoRI–HindIII fragments from pPB22 or pHD1 into the EcoRI–HindIII sites of ptrpBG1-PLK, respectively. The two plasmids, pHD22 and pHD24, were linearized withScaI and separately integrated into the amyElocus of B. subtilis strain W168 (prototrophic). Transformation was by natural competence (30Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); selection was for chloramphenicol resistance (5 μg/ml). Integration was confirmed by screening for the absence of amylase production by iodine staining (31Sekiguchi J. Takada N. Okada H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 121: 688-694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting strains, PLBS127 (wild type trp leader,trpE′-′lacZ) and PLBS129 (SD trpleader, trpE′-′lacZ), contain both an intacttrp operon in the natural chromosomal locus and atrpE′-′lacZ translational fusion under control of the trp promoter with either a wild type or a mutanttrp leader region. For in vivo TrpE protein labeling, pHD15 was transformed into the Escherichia coli T7 overexpression strain K38(pGP1–2) (32Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar) such that expression of plasmid-borne trpE is under control of T7 RNA polymerase. Exclusive labeling of TrpE was carried out by a published procedure (32Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in minimal Spizizen salts medium (33Spizizen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.2% acid-hydrolyzed casein, 0.2% glucose, and 5 μg/ml chloramphenicol in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml tryptophan. Each culture (8 ml) was harvested in mid-exponential phase (Klett 110, green filter number 54) by centrifugation, washed with cold 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and resuspended in 4 ml of Z buffer (34Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Samples (0.1 ml) were diluted 10-fold with Z buffer. Ten μl of fresh lysozyme solution (10 mg/ml) was added, and the mixtures were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 10 μl of 10% Triton X-100. β-Galactosidase activity was subsequently assayed as described (34Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). TRAP was purified as described previously (20Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Preparation of TRAP-deficient S30 extract followed a published procedure (16Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA used in this analysis was synthesizedin vitro using the Ambion MEGAscript kit and plasmid pHD15 linearized with BamHI as template. Translation reactions (50 μl) contained 72 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 72 mmNH4Cl, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 2.4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.08 mm calcium folinate, 0.2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate, 20 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 35 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 1 mml-tryptophan, 0.1 mmconcentration of the remaining amino acids (minus methionine), 4 μl of S30 extract (30 mg of total protein), 800 units/ml DNase I, 500 units/ml RNasin, 2 pmol of unlabeled transcript, and 10 μCi of [35S]methionine. To reduce endogenous mRNA and DNA, the S30 extract plus DNase I was preincubated for 15 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of the remaining components. Concentrations of TRAP used in various reactions are indicated in the appropriate figure legend. Final reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer (16Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples (5 μl) were heated at 95 °C for 3 min and electrophoresed through a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Radiolabeled protein bands were quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and the ImageQuant software package. Predictions of RNA secondary structures within the wild type and mutant trp leaders were performed using the MFOLD program (35Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://www.ibc.wustl. edu/∼zuker. Primer extension inhibition experiments were carried out to map the position of the 3′-ends of stable RNA secondary structures. Gel-purified transcripts used in this analysis were synthesized with the Ambion MEGAscript in vitro transcription kit fromHindIII-linearized pPB22 (wild type trp leader) or HindIII-linearized pHD2 (SD blocking hairpin mutant) as template. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) contained 0.5 pmol of γ-32P-end-labeled primer complementary to nucleotides 245–265 relative to the start of trp operon transcription, 0.2 pmol of in vitro generated mRNA, 3 μg of TRAP, 1 mml-tryptophan, and 0.375 mm dNTPs in toeprint buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to allow TRAP·RNA complex formation and to allow the end-labeled primer and the transcript to anneal. After the addition of 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (U.S. Biochemical), incubation was continued at 37 °C for 10 min. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. Samples were resuspended in 5 μl of water followed by the addition of 3 μl of standard sequencing stop solution. The 30 S ribosomal subunit toeprint reactions followed a published procedure (16Du H. Tarpey R. Babitzke P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 2582-2586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), except that toeprint buffer was used (see above). The transcripts and end-labeled primer used in the analysis are described above. Samples were fractionated through standard 6% sequencing gels. Control sequencing reactions were carried out with the Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical) using the same plasmids and end-labeled primer described above. The transcripts used in this analysis were synthesized using the Ambion MEGAscript in vitrotranscription kit and plasmid pPB22 or pHD2 linearized withHindIII as template. Titrations of RNases and chemical reagents were routinely performed to determine the amount of each reagent that would prevent multiple cleavages or chemical modifications in any one transcript so that we could minimize the potential of secondary rearrangements in short RNA segments. RNA samples were partially digested with RNase T1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or RNase V1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Reaction mixtures (0.1 ml) contained 20 pmol (2 μg) of TRAP, 1 pmol of transcript and 1 mml-tryptophan in TKM buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2) (22Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP·RNA complexes were allowed to form for 10 min at 37 °C, at which time 1.5 units of RNase T1 or 1 × 10−3 units of RNase V1 was added, and the samples were further incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Samples were immediately extracted with phenol/chloroform, and the RNA was recovered by two successive ethanol precipitations. Chemical modification reactions using DMS or CMCT were performed as described previously (22Babitzke P. Stults J.T. Shire S.J. Yanofsky C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16597-16604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TRAP·RNA complexes were allowed to form for 10 min at 37 °C prior to the addition of 0.5 μl of DMS to the mixtures. Following a 4-min incubation at 37 °C, reactions were terminated, and the RNA was recovered as described (36Hattman S. Newman L. Murthy H.M. Nagaraja V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10027-10031Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). CMCT modification was performed by adding 20 μg/ml CMCT (final concentration) and incubating at 37 °C for 30 min. Reactions were terminated, and the RNA was recovered as described for DMS modification. RNA pellets were dried and resuspended in primer extension buffer. Hybridization mixtures contained 1 pmol of RNA and 2 pmol of γ-32P-end-labeled primer in primer extension buffer (U.S. Biochemical). Mixtures were heated to 80 °C for 3 min and immediately placed on ice for 15 min. Following the addition of 0.5 mm dNTPs (final concentration), primer extension was initiated by adding 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (5 μl final volume). After 10 min at 42 °C, reactions were terminated by the addition of 3 μl of standard sequencing stop solution. Samples were fractionated through standard 6% sequencing gels. Control sequencing reactions were carried out using the same plasmids and end-labeled primer described above. Previous in vivoexperiments demonstrated that TRAP can regulate translation oftrpE, the first structural gene of the trpEDCFBAoperon, approximately 13-fold (19Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was also shown that aB. subtilis strain containing several mutations in thetrp leader that were predicted to destabilize the SD blocking hairpin (SDtrpL), without altering the SD sequence itself, reduced the ability of TRAP to regulate TrpE synthesis (25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6362-6370Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm these in vivo observations, we constructed twoB. subtilis strains containingtrpE′-′lacZ translational fusions that were controlled by the wild type (WTtrpL) or SDtrpL trp leader and analyzed β-galactosidase expression when each strain was grown in the presence and absence of exogenous tryptophan. We observed minimal expression in the WTtrpL strain PLBS127 grown in the presence of tryptophan (TableI). The effect of exogenous tryptophan on expression of WTtrpL trpE′-′lacZ can be assessed from the −Trp/+Trp ratio, which was 345. Note that this ratio reflects both transcriptional and translational regulation. Comparable experiments were performed with the SDtrpL strain PLBS129. In this case the −Trp/+Trp ratio was only 19, significantly lower than that observed for the strain carrying the wild type trpleader (Table I). Moreover, comparison of β-galactosidase expression of the two strains grown in the presence of tryptophan allows us to assess the level of TRAP-mediated translational control. The SDtrpL/WTtrpL ratio of 12.5 is in good agreement with previously published in vivo results (19Kuroda M.I. Henner D. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3080-3088Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Merino E. Babitzke P. Yanofsky C. J.

Open table in a new tab To analyze the TRAP-dependent translational regulation oftrpE directly, we performed RNA-directed cell-free translation experiments. An in vitro system utilizing a TRAP-deficient B. subtilis S30 extract was used to determine if TRAP binding to trp operon leader RNA inhibits TrpE synthesis. The in vitro synthesized transcripts used in this analysis contained the wild type trp leader and the entiretrpE coding sequence. As an in vivo control for the size of TrpE, we carried out exclusive labeling of plasmid encoded TrpE protein (Fig. 1A, lane 1). When we used the RNA-directed cell-free translation system, we observed a major protein species that was the same size asin vivo labeled TrpE (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). No in vitro translation products were produced without the addition of trpE RNA (Fig.1 A, lane 11). When the trpEtranscript was preincubated with increasing amounts of tryptophan-activated TRAP prior to the addition of the remaining components of the translation system, a corresponding decrease in TrpE translation was observed (Fig. 1, A (lanes 3–6) and B). When the preincubation step was omitted, the addition of increasing amounts of TRAP to the translation system resulted in a similar decrease in TrpE synthesis (Fig. 1,A (lanes 7–10) and B). Note that it was not possible to perform the control experiment in which TRAP is added in the absence of tryptophan, since tryptophan is required for TrpE synthesis. When taken together with previously published findings, these results demonstrate that TRAP binding to the (G/U)AG repeats located between nucleotides 36 and 91 of the untranslated trp leader results in a substantial reduction of TrpE synthesis. To develop a detailed model of the TRAP-dependent trpE translational regulatory mechanism, we analyzed the RNA structures predicted to form in the leader segment of trp operon read-through transcripts using free energy minimization (35Jaeger J.A. Turner D.H. Zuker M. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 281-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In this analysis, we included nucleotides 1–210 relative to the start of transcription. The most thermodynamically stable RNA secondary structure predicted to form in the trp leader is shown in Fig.2 A(ΔG 0 = −37.3 kcal/mol). Interestingly, the last six (G/U)AG repeats that comprise the TRAP binding target are contained in the 5′-half of the base of this structure, while the first five triplet repeats are predicted to be single-stranded. Moreover, the position of the TRAP binding site suggested that TRAP binding would disrupt the base of this structure. We also analyzed the RNA structures predicted to form if tryptophan-activated TRAP was bound to the (G/U)AG repeats from positions 36–91 of the trp leader. We determined the structures predicted to form between nucleotides 92 and 210 and also between 1 and 210, except that in this case we removed nucleotides 36–91 from the analysis. In each case, two secondary structures were predicted to form in the transcript downstream from the TRAP binding site (Fig. 2 B). One of these structures consists primarily of the Rho-independent terminator present at the apex of the unbound structure (Fig. 2 A), while another entirely new stem-loop structure contains the trpE SD sequence in the 3′-half of the stem (ΔG 0 = −12.4 kcal/mol). Note that when TRAP is not bound to the transcript, the nucleotides that comprise the 5′-half of the SD blocking hairpin would be base-paired with a segment of the TRAP binding target, making these two structures mutually exclusi"
https://openalex.org/W2051176006,"Enhancement of tyrosine phosphorylation in cells by the application of pervanadate, an extremely potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, provokes the rapid metalloprotease-dependent cleavage of ErbB-4, a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. The pervanadate-induced proteolysis occurs in NIH 3T3 cells expressing transfected human ErbB-4 and in several cell lines that express endogenous ErbB-4. One product of this proteolytic event is a membrane-anchored molecule of approximately 80 kDa, which is heavily tyrosine phosphorylated and which possesses tyrosine kinase catalytic activity toward an exogenous substrate in vitro. This response to pervanadate is not dependent on protein kinase C activation, which has previously been demonstrated to also activate ErbB-4 cleavage. Hence, the pervanadate and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced proteolytic cleavage of ErbB-4 seem to proceed by different mechanisms, although both require metalloprotease activity. Moreover, pervanadate activation of ErbB-4 cleavage, but not that of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate , is blocked by the oxygen radical scavenger pyrrolidine dithiocarbomate. A second phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, phenylarsine oxide, also stimulates a similar cleavage of ErbB-4 but, unlike pervanadate, is not sensitive to pyrrolidine dithiocarbomate. Last, pervanadate is shown to stimulate the proteolytic cell surface processing of a second and unrelated transmembrane molecule: the precursor for amphiregulin, an epidermal growth factor-related molecule. Amphiregulin cleavage by pervanadate occurred in the absence of a cytoplasmic domain and tyrosine phosphorylation of this substrate.

However, other EGF receptor agonists such as EGF or transforming growth factor α, are reported to not bind to ErbB-4 (7Beerli R.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6071-6076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 8Riese D.J., II Kim E.D. Elenius K. Buckley S. Klagsbrun M. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20047-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Following ligand binding and the initiation of signal transduction pathways, the EGF receptor is rapidly trafficked to coated pits, internalized, and ultimately degraded when endosomes fuse with lysosomes (9Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Cell Biol. 1976; 71: 159-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). This receptor trafficking pathway gives rise to down-regulation of the EGF receptor and is a feature of most all growth factor-activated receptor tyrosine kinases (10Sorkin A. Waters C.M. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 375-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). epidermal growth factor pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline transforming growth factor phospholipase C phenylarsine oxide polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Madin-Darby canine kidney. In contrast to the processing of the EGF receptor, the ErbB-4 receptor, as well as ErbB-3 and ErbB-2, are not subject to rapid internalization following ligand binding (11Sorkin A. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3021-3028PubMed Google Scholar, 12Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for this difference is not clear; however, only the activated EGF receptor is able to associate with the adaptin AP-2 coated-pit molecule (12Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it has been found that ErbB-4, but not other EGF receptor family members, is subject to proteolytic cleavage that produces a membrane-anchored 80-kDa cytoplasmic domain fragment and a 120-kDa ectodomain fragment (14Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Based on inhibitor studies, it is likely that this cleavage is due to a metalloprotease. Binding of an ErbB-4 ligand, however, does not alter the rate of proteolytic cleavage. Activation of protein kinase C, directly with TPA or indirectly by occupancy of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor, dramatically accelerates the rate of metalloprotease-dependent ErbB-4 cleavage (14Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). While the exact site of cleavage is not known, an ErbB-4 isoform, HER4 JM-b, containing a 13-residue sequence insertion within the ectodomain juxtamembrane region is resistant to TPA-induced cleavage (16Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This suggests that the sequence insertion, a result of alternative mRNA splicing, has interrupted the metalloprotease cleavage site. Also, a chimeric ErbB-4 receptor in which the ectodomain is replaced by that of the EGF receptor is resistant to TPA-induced cleavage (14Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Ectodomain cleavage occurs frequently among cell surface transmembrane proteins including several that are involved in the control of cell proliferative behavior: receptor tyrosine kinases (14Vecchi M.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), metalloproteases are implicated in the proteolytic cleavage. In some cases, the physiological significance of these cleavage events has been demonstrated to be biologically significant; the release of diffusible growth factors, reduced cell adhesion, or increased migration. Depending on the cell type, ErbB-4 is thought to function as either an initiator of cell proliferation or differentiation (1Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.-M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Hence, significant loss of ErbB-4 receptor could influence cell behavior in several directions. Targeted disruption of the ErbB-4 gene in mice leads to impaired trabeculation of the developing heart and embryonic lethality after 10 days gestation (34Grassman M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). However, ErbB-4 expression is limited compared with that of other receptors in this family and its essential functions beyond embryonic heart development are not known. Although ErbB-4 ligands do not accelerate cleavage of this receptor, it is possible that other tyrosine kinases influence its fate on the surface either by modification of ErbB-4 or modification of basal protease activity. Hence, we have examined the influence of pervanadate, a potent phosphotyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, on ErbB-4 processing at the cell surface. Polyclonal IgG to the carboxyl terminus (residues 1291–1308) of ErbB-4 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Serum raised against the carboxyl-terminal sequence 1108–1264 of ErbB-4 was generously supplied by Dr. Matthias Kraus, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan. Antisera to PLC-γ1 was described previously (35Arteaga C.L. Johnson M.D. Todderud G. Coffey R.J. Carpenter G. Page D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10435-10439Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Anti-phosphotyrosine purified IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A were purchased from Zymed Labs, Inc.Mouse monoclonal antibody 6R1C2.4 to human amphiregulin was a generous gift of Dr. Gregory Plowman (Sugen). Affinity purified rabbit antisera to mouse immunoglobulin was purchased from Cappel Laboratories. TPA, phenylarsine oxide (PAO), fibronectin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbomate (PDTC), Protein A-Sepharose, and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from Sigma. Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and Protein A-agarose were products of Pierce. 125I-labeled Protein A was a product of ICN and 125I-labeled streptavidin was from Amersham. Immobilon-P membranes were from MCI. The metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 (Batimastat) was a generous gift of Dr. Lynn Matrisian, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Pervanadate was freshly prepared by each experiment as follows: 1 m solutions of vanadate and H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline were prepared and mixed to give a 0.5 m solution of pervanadate. As pervanadate is unstable, this was diluted into cell cultures, at the indicated final concentration of 100 μm, within 20 min of preparation. T47-14 cells, transfected NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress human ErbB-4 (approximately 1 × 106receptors per cell), have been described elsewhere (12Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). This cell line was routinely grown in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 μm gentamycin, and 10% calf serum. Where indicated, cells were grown on fibronectin (10 μg/ml) precoated plates. Atrial tumor myocytes, AT-1 cells, derived from T antigen transgenic mice (15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. D. M. Roden, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. These cells, maintained as transplanted tumors, were prepared and grown in culture as described previously (15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the cells maintain the phenotypic properties of cardiac myocytes. Experimental cultures were generally grown in 60- or 100-mm diameter culture dishes. MDCK strain II cells were stably transfected, by calcium phosphate precipitation, with human amphiregulin cDNA in a vector having a butyrate-inducible promoter (37Cook P.W. Mattox P.W. Keeble W.W. Pittelkow M.R. Plowman G.D. Shoyab M. Adelman J.P. Shipley G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2547-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), a generous gift of Dr. Gary Shipley (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR), and selected in G418. The amphiregulin cytoplasmic domain truncation mutant ARTL has been described elsewhere (38Thorne B.A. Plowman G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1635-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar); transfection into MDCK II cells and selection with G418 were performed as described above. The cells were grown on Transwell filters (0.4 μm pore size, Costar) in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (31Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures were used when the transepithelial resistance was >200 ohms · cm2. Cell lysates were obtained as described previously (15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, after overnight starvation in DMEM and 0.5% serum, monolayers were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C in basal medium (DMEM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) with indicated additions, i.e. pervanadate, inhibitors. The cells were then washed with calcium, magnesium-free PBS and solubilized for 20 min at 4 °C in TGH buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm Na3VO4). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g, 10 min) at 4 °C and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford. The ErbB-4 protein was immunoprecipitated by adding approximately 1 μg of ErbB-4 antibody per 200 μg of cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubating (1 h, 4 °C) with Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B. Subsequently the immunocomplexes were extensively washed with TGH buffer and resuspended in 1 × Laemmli buffer. After boiling, proteins in the samples were electrophoretically separated on reducing 7.5% PAGE-SDS gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS containing 0.05% Tween for 1 h prior to blotting with antibodies to anti-ErbB-4. Prior to anti-phosphotyrosine blotting, membranes were blocked by incubating for 1 h with 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST buffer (0.05% Tween, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4). Membranes were then incubated with the appropriate antibody for 2 h at room temperature and washed with PBS or TBST buffer, incubated with 125I-Protein A for 1 h at room temperature, and after five washes with PBS or TBST buffer, visualized by autoradiography (Kodak X-Omat AR film). Where indicated, bound antibody was detected with horseradish peroxidase-Protein A and ECL. T47-14 cells overexpressing ErbB-4 were washed and the cell monolayers solubilized at 4 °C in TGH buffer with Na3VO4. Equal aliquots of cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated by adding 0.5 μg of antibody to ErbB-4. After a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, Protein A-Sepharose was added for 1 h. The immunocomplexes were then washed twice with TGH buffer without Na3VO4 and twice with kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 3 mm MnCl2, 20 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm Na3VO4). The immunocomplexes were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 μm cold ATP and 4 μg of recombinant phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (39Horstman D.A. Ball R. Carpenter G. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 278-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was added. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at room temperature for the indicated times before stopping the reaction by adding 50 μl of 2 × Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were subsequently separated on a 7.5% PAGE-SDS gel and analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by Western blotting with antibody to phosphotyrosine. The amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated PLC-γ1 was quantitated by densitometric scanning. For each phosphorylation sample, a parallel aliquot of lysate was analyzed for ErbB-4 protein by immunoprecipitation and Western blot, as described above. Transfected MDCK cells were incubated with sodium butyrate (5 mm) for 16 h to induce amphiregulin expression. The monolayers were washed with serum-free DMEM and twice with PBS containing 0.1 mmCaCl2 and 1.0 mm MgCl2(PBS+) before cell surface biotinylation (30 min at 4 °C) with 1.5 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-LC biotin in PBS+. Following biotinylation, the cells were washed twice with PBS+ and once with serum-free DMEM. To measure processing of surface biotinylated amphiregulin, cells were incubated for the indicated times with serum-free DMEM (supplemented withl-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, non-essential amino acids) in the absence or presence of pervanadate. At each indicated time the media was collected and cell lysates were prepared as described elsewhere (31Brown C.L. Meise K.S. Plowman G.D. Coffey R.J. Dempsey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17258-17268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Dempsey P.J. Coffey R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16878-16889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, total cell lysates and conditioned media samples were incubated overnight with 0.20 and 0.05 μg/ml anti-amphiregulin, respectively. The immune complexes were then precipitated by adding affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h followed by a 50% slurry of Protein A-agarose for 2 h. The Protein A-agarose was then pelleted and washed stringently. Proteins in the complexes were separated on reducing 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. These membranes were subsequently rinsed in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20, blocked for 1 h in the same buffer containing 3% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with 125I-labeled streptavidin. After extensive washing, amphiregulin precursor and processed forms were detected by autoradiography, using Kodak X-Omat film. Previous data have established that ErbB-4 is cleaved by a metalloprotease activity and that this reaction is not influenced by ligand binding to the receptor tyrosine kinase (15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To assess whether the tyrosine phosphorylation of other molecules might influence this proteolytic event, cells were treated with pervanadate, a potent tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor (40Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), which raises the tyrosine phosphate content of many intracellular proteins. As shown in Fig. 1 A, a 30-min exposure to 1 mm pervanadate, but not 1 mmvanadate or 1 mm H2O2, results in the appearance of an 80-kDa molecule that is reactive with antibody to the carboxyl terminus of ErbB-4 and is, therefore, equivalent to the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment previously detected (14Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Also, the appearance of the 80-kDa ErbB-4 fragment coincides with a decrease in the level of the native 180-kDa ErbB-4 receptor. In the experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, cells were exposed for increasing periods of time to 100 μm pervanadate, an optimal concentration (data not shown), and the cell lysates were precipitated with anti-ErbB-4 and subsequently probed with anti-phosphotyrosine. The data show that pervanadate induces within 10 min the tyrosine phosphorylation of the native 180-kDa ErbB-4 receptor and concomitantly its hydrolysis to yield the 80-kDa fragment which accumulates as a heavily tyrosine-phosphorylated molecule. While the mechanisms of pervanadate influence on all cellular functions at the molecular level are not completely understood, activated oxygen species formed from the combination of H2O2 and vanadate oxidize an essential thiol at the active site of phosphotyrosine phosphatases and thereby inhibit enzymatic activity (40Huyer G. Liu S. Kelly J. Moffat J. Payette P. Kennedy B. Tsaprailis G. Gresser M.J. Ramachandran C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 41Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the oxygen radical scavenger PDTC can block some but not all cellular responses to pervanadate (41Krejsa C.M. Nadler S.G. Esselstyn J.M. Kavanagh T.J. Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11541-11549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We have tested this possible mechanism by pretreating cells with PDTC, before adding pervanadate. This experiment, shown in Fig.2, employed two cell types NIH 3T3 cells that express the transfected human ErbB-4 receptor (panel A) and AT-1 rat cardiac myocytes that express endogenous ErbB-4 receptors (panel B). As the latter cell line has a lower number of ErbB-4 receptors, the receptors in those lysates were concentrated by immunoprecipitation prior to blotting with anti-ErbB-4. The results show that pervanadate in each cell type induces the cleavage of ErbB-4 and that PDTC effectively blocks this cleavage. Additionally, pervanadate induces a similar cleavage of endogenous ErbB-4 in two human carcinoma cell lines, OVCAR-3 and T47D, derived, respectively, from ovarian and mammary tumors (data not shown). Previous data have shown that TPA induces cleavage of the ErbB-4 receptor to a 80-kDa fragment, containing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and a 120-kDa ectodomain fragment requires metalloprotease activity (14Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 15Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The specific metalloprotease inhibitor BB-94 (Batimastat) was utilized to determine whether the pervanadate-induced cleavage of ErbB-4 requires metalloprotease activity. The results, shown in Fig. 3, clearly show that preincubation of cells with BB-94 effectively blocks pervanadate-induced ErbB-4 cleavage, demonstrating that the pervanadate-induced accumulation of intracellular phosphotyrosine and ErbB-4 cleavage is dependent on metalloprotease activation.

Upon concanavalin A treatment of cells, the induced cellular activation of gelatinase A was markedly elevated in the presence of the rCBD. Therefore, the mechanistic aspects of gelatinase A binding to cells by this domain were further studied using cell attachment assays. Fibroblasts attached to rCBD-coated microplate wells in a manner that was inhibited by soluble rCBD, blocking antibodies to the β1-integrin subunit but not the α2-integrin subunit, and bacterial collagenase treatment. Addition of soluble collagen rescued the attachment of collagenase-treated cells to the rCBD. As a probe on ligand blots of octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside-solubilized cell membrane extracts, the rCBD bound 140- and 160-kDa protein bands. Their identities were likely procollagen chains being both bacterial collagenase-sensitive and also converted upon pepsin digestion to 112- and 126-kDa bands that co-migrated with collagen α1(I) and α2(I) chains. A rCBD mutant protein (Lys263 → Ala) with reduced collagen affinity showed less cell attachment, whereas a heparin-binding deficient mutant (Lys357 → Ala), heparinase treatment, or heparin addition did not alter attachment. Thus, a cell-binding mechanism for gelatinase A is revealed that does not involve the hemopexin COOH domain. Instead, an attachment complex comprising gelatinase A-native type I collagen-β1-integrin forms as a result of interactions involving the collagen-binding domain of the enzyme.

These properties may similarly provide another mode of cell binding to membrane-associated matrix proteins, including collagen and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and thus may play a role in gelatinase A activation (18Crabbe T. Joannou C. Docherty A.J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and its physiological function on the cell surface. Here we report experiments that establish that the fibronectin-like CBD localizes gelatinase A to fibroblast cell surfaces by the formation of a gelatinase A-type I collagen-β1-integrin complex. Notably, this distinct pool of cell-bound enzyme shows a lowered cellular activation potential compared with soluble progelatinase A. This finding has important implications for the role of cell membrane-bound stromal gelatinase A on tumor cells. rCBD (Val191–Gln364) and the rC domain (Gly417–Cys631) of human gelatinase A were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by Zn2+-chelate and gelatin-Sepharose chromatography as appropriate (14Bigg H.F.

Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry of the recombinant proteins was performed on a SCIEX API 300 (Perkin-Elmer) mass spectrometer. The convention used in this paper to distinguish between the recombinant protein comprised of the gelatinase A triple fibronectin type II-like repeat and the domain present in the natural enzyme will be to refer to the recombinant collagen-binding domain as the rCBD and to the domain in the enzyme as the CBD (no r). Rabbit polyclonal antibody (αCBD) was raised against rCBD injected with sarcosyl-extracted rCBD inclusion bodies and was then affinity purified over rCBD-AffiGel 10 (Bio-Rad) columns. Anti-peptide antibody (αHis6) to the NH2-terminal His6fusion tag on the recombinant proteins was affinity purified as before (16Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7473-7481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Human gingival fibroblasts, kindly provided by Drs D. Brunette and H. Larjava (University of British Columbia), were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and antibiotics at 37 °C. To minimize proteolysis of membrane proteins during cell harvesting for cell attachment assays, 0.2 mm EDTA with a low concentration of trypsin (0.05%) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) was used for 30–60 s only. Fibroblasts in 96-microwell tissue culture plates were treated with soluble rCBD (1.0 × 10−4 to 1.0 × 10−8m) or rC domain (5.6 × 10−6 to 1.0 × 10−8m) for 24–28 h during and/or after ConA treatment (20 μg/ml) (5Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of quiescent cells in serum-free conditions. Conditioned medium and cell extracts were analyzed by zymography on 10% polyacrylamide/40 μg/ml gelatin SDS-PAGE gels (27Overall C.M. Limeback H. Biochem. J. 1988; 256: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine whether progelatinase A could bind unstimulated cells by the CBD, quiescent cells were thoroughly rinsed with PBS to remove unbound secreted enzyme. Gelatinase A was then competed from cell surfaces by incubation of the cell layers with 1.2 or 12 × 10−6m rCBD in serum-free α-MEM at 22 °C for 5 min only. This short time was selected to minimize contributions from newly synthesized enzyme to the medium during the incubation. After medium harvesting, the remaining cell-associated enzyme was assessed after lysis of the cell layer with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Tissue culture surface treated 96-microwell plates were coated with 2-fold serially diluted rCBD (50–0.25 μg/ml) in 100 μl PBS/well for 18 h at 4 °C. After blocking with 10 mg/ml heat-denatured bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min, 4 × 104 fibroblasts were added per well in serum-free α-MEM (to avoid cell attachment from serum proteins) and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. Cells were then thoroughly rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The attached cells were stained with 0.1% crystal violet in 200 mm boric acid, pH 6.0 (28Keung W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). After extensive rinses, cellular stain was dissolved in 10% acetic acid, and cell numbers were quantitated by measurement of the optical density at 590 nm in a microplate reader. Positive control wells were coated with fibronectin (Chemicon) or acid soluble type I collagen prepared from rat tail collagen (25Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11555-11566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) or were nonblocked wells. Any cell attachment to BSA-blocked wells served to adjust for nonspecific attachment. Experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated several times, but results were only compared for experiments on the same plate. For scanning electron microscopy, cells were seeded and grown in serum-free α-MEM on rCBD-coated glass coverslips (1 cm2) blocked with BSA. After 1 or 2 h, cells were rinsed and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Slides were stained with 1% osmium in PBS, treated with 2% tannic acid, dried by critical point drying, and sputter-coated with gold for analysis on a Stereoscan 260 (Cambridge Instruments) scanning electron microscope. Phase contrast microscopy was used to quantitate cell spreading at different time points after seeding 5 × 103 cells on rCBD- or fibronectin-coated wells. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 30 or 60 min at 22 °C, and cell spreading, as judged by the appearance of lamellar cytoplasm, was then quantitated. Harvested cells were treated with 0.075–7.5 units/100 μl highly pure bacterial collagenase (clostridiopeptidase A, Type III, fraction A (EC 3.4.24.3), Sigma) or 0.01 and 0.1 units/ml highly pure heparinase (Flavobacterium heparinum heparinase, Seikagaku Corporation) in α-MEM with 10 mm Ca2+ acetate and 0.1% BSA for 15–30 min at 37 °C. Enzymes were then removed by repeated cell sedimentation (120 × g, 5 min) and washes in serum-free α-MEM prior to seeding in rCBD (25 μg/ml)-coated wells. Attachment of bacterial collagenase-treated cells to native type I collagen bound to rCBD-coated wells was also quantitated. In addition, cells were seeded in the presence of blocking monoclonal antibody mAb13 (0.6–20 μg/ml) to the β1-integrin subunit (kindly provided by Dr. K. Yamada, NIDR, National Institutes of Health) or ascites fluid antibody (P1E6, Life Technologies, Inc.) to the α2-integrin subunit diluted 1:10 to 1:100. Affinity purified αCBD and αHis6 antibodies served as controls in the 90-min incubations. The effect of 1 or 10 μg of heparin (Sigma) in 100 μl of PBS added to rCBD-coated wells for 1 h prior to seeding was also assessed. Confluent fibroblast cultures were rinsed thoroughly with PBS and then treated with 50 mmoctyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min at 15 °C (29Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Argraves S. Suzuki S. Ruoslahti E. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 144: 475-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). After clarification at 10,000 × gfor 15 min at 22 °C, detergent-solubilized cell membrane protein was precipitated at 0 °C and then collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 0 °C. The protein pellet was dissolved in PBS, separated under nonreducing or reducing (65 mm DTT) conditions by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). The blots were BSA-blocked and then incubated with 20 μg/ml rCBD in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, with 0.2% BSA for 1 h at 22 °C. After washes, rCBD bound to the blotted proteins was detected using αCBD antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The rCBD-binding proteins were characterized by digestion with pepsin (0.1 mg/ml (Sigma) for 3 h at 15 °C, pH 2.0) or highly pure bacterial collagenase (4 units/100 μl for 18 h at 37 °C, pH 7.0). An aliquot of the pepsin-treated sample was adjusted to pH 7.0 and incubated with bacterial collagenase for 18 h at 37 °C. The efficiency and specificity of the enzyme digestions was verified using BSA, type I collagen and rCBD as control substrates. The rCBD mass was measured by electrospray mass spectrometry to be 21,218 Da, confirming NH2-terminal methionine processing of the recombinant protein (predicted mass 21, 212 Da), fidelity of expression, and homogeneity of the protein preparation. The typical yield of purified rCBD from 3.6 liters of culture was 120 mg. When rCBD was incubated with human fibroblasts for 24 h during and after ConA treatment (Fig.1 A) or for 24 h after ConA treatment only (not shown), an increase in gelatinase A activation was apparent in six separate experiments. At high rCBD concentrations, essentially all the soluble gelatinase A was converted to the 59-kDa (−DTT) activated form (5Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although quantitation of enzyme levels from zymograms is only semiquantitative, less than ∼3% of the total soluble gelatinase A remained as the 66-kDa (−DTT) zymogen form in the presence of 100 μm rCBD (lane 100 +) compared with ∼28–34% in those cells not treated with rCBD (lanes 0 +). This trend was also apparent at 50 μm rCBD. In contrast, recombinant gelatinase A C domain reduced cellular activation of the enzyme as before (17Overall C.M. Wallon U.M. Steffensen B. De Clerck Y. Tschesche H. Abbey R.S. Edwards D. Hawkes S. Khokha R. Inhibitors of Metalloproteinases in Development and Disease. Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam, Holland1998Google Scholar) (not shown). Cell lysates containing gelatinase A that was bound to cells via the C domain of the enzyme or was intracellular in the cell secretory pathway were also prepared after rCBD treatment. Unlike the effect of rCBD on gelatinase A levels in the medium (Fig. 1 A), addition of rCBD to cells during and/or after ConA treatment did not alter the ratios of latent (66 kDa) to active (59 kDa) gelatinase A in the lysates (Fig. 1 B). As estimated from enzyme levels per microliter, the total enzyme recovered in the lysates of ConA-activated cells was ∼10-fold less than that in the medium. In other experiments, zymography also demonstrated that cell-bound progelatinase A (the 66-kDa zymogen form) was competitively displaced from unstimulated cells that had not been ConA-treated. This was found even after a short 5-min pulse of the rCBD intended to minimize accumulations of newly secreted progelatinase A during the experiment (Fig. 1 C). Extraction of the cell layer with SDS-PAGE sample buffer revealed that additional gelatinase A remained associated with the cells that was either not fully released by the short exposure to the rCBD or was bound by the C domain or was intracellular. That the increased gelatinase A activation upon ConA addition combined with rCBD treatment was not because of a direct cellular response to binding rCBD was shown in cultures incubated in the absence of ConA where rCBD addition for 24 h did not induce gelatinase A activation (not shown). Moreover, neither gelatinase A expression nor activation was altered in cells that were attached to rCBD-coated plates (see “The Collagen-binding Domain of Gelatinase A Mediates Cell Attachment”) without ConA treatment (Fig. 1 D). Thus, these data show that in addition to interactions involving the C domain, progelatinase A can bind to cells via another domain of the enzyme, the CBD. Because only latent and not active gelatinase A was displaced in unstimulated cultures by the rCBD, these competition experiments also show that cell binding via the CBD of progelatinase A is not sufficient for enzyme activation. Indeed, because gelatinase A activation upon ConA treatment increases in the presence of excess rCBD, we conclude that cellular progelatinase A bound by the CBD has a lower cellular activation potential than the soluble enzyme in the medium. Hence, displacement of CBD-bound progelatinase A by the rCBD in ConA-treated cells may facilitate entry of the latent enzyme into the cellular activation pathway. The mechanistic aspects of gelatinase A cell binding via the CBD were further investigated by adaptation of cell attachment assays. Fibroblasts attached to rCBD-coated microwells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.2 A), but this was less efficient than cell attachment to fibronectin (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of fibroblasts with soluble rCBD prior to seeding inhibited attachment to rCBD-coated wells in a concentration-dependent manner, confirming binding specificity (Fig. 2 C). Attachment was not observed in wells coated with 10 mg/ml BSA, whereas cell attachment to tissue culture-treated plastic alone or to type I collagen-coated wells was similar to that on fibronectin under saturating conditions. As assessed by phase contrast microscopy significantly fewer fibroblasts displayed cytoplasmic spreading on rCBD coated at 10 μg/ml (23%) compared with fibronectin (50%) after 30 min. Greater differences in cell spreading were apparent between rCBD and fibronectin using 25 μg/ml coated protein with 23 and 90%, respectively, of the cells spreading after 30 min. Although the kinetics of cell attachment and spreading differed at these early time points, spreading of cells on both substrates plateaued at 80–90% of the attached cells by 60 min. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed both cell attachment to rCBD protein and these differences. After 1 and 2 h on fibronectin (Fig.3, A and C, respectively), cells demonstrated typical cytoplasmic spreading (arrows) with a diameter of ∼100 μm. In contrast, cells on rCBD were smaller (diameter of ∼50 μm) and more rounded after 1 h (Fig. 3 B) with limited spreading and extension of only delicate filopodia (arrowheads) after 2 h (Fig.3 D). Thus, this novel use of cell attachment assays confirmed the potential for gelatinase A binding to cells via the CBD of the enzyme.Figure 3Morphological differences between cells cultured on rCBD and fibronectin. 1 × 103 human fibroblasts were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with 25 μg/ml rCBD or fibronectin and blocked with BSA.

At 2.5 μg/ml antibody, more than 50% of the cell attachment to rCBD-coated wells was inhibited (Fig. 4). This inhibition increased to 90% at antibody concentrations >5 μg/ml. In comparison, α2-integrin blocking antibody and affinity purified αCBD and αHis6 control antibodies showed no significant blocking effects at these concentrations. Ligand blotting was performed to identify cell proteins that may interact with the rCBD. On polyvinylidene difluoride blots of octyl-β-d-thioglucopyranoside solubilized cell membrane proteins, rCBD bound two distinct protein bands having apparent masses of 140 and 160 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig.5) in the approximate positions of α- and β-integrin subunits or procollagen chains. However, both bands were degraded by bacterial collagenase. The 140- and 160-kDa bands were also partially pepsin-sensitive, being degraded to pepsin-resistant, but collagenase-sensitive, 112- and 126-kDa proteins. These co-migrated with collagen α1(I) and α2(I) chains that were also bound by the rCBD (Fig. 5). Thus, these data exclude the identity of the 140- and 160-kDa protein bands as integrin chains. Rather, the data provide strong evidence that the rCBD can interact with procollagen chains in cell membrane protein extracts. Nonetheless, other proteins, including those that do not renature on these blots or that require subunit interactions, might also be involved in the CBD interaction. In addition to any direct interaction with other cell membrane proteins, the ligand blots indicated that binding of gelatinase A CBD to native cellular collagen might represent one mode of gelatinase A cell binding. To test this, rCBD-coated wells were incubated with 10 μg of soluble type I collagen in 100 μl of PBS/well to saturate rCBD collagen-binding sites prior to cell seeding. On the rCBD-collagen complexes, cell attachment levels approached"
https://openalex.org/W1551458475,"To analyze protein degradation in mitochondria and the role of molecular chaperone proteins in this process, bovine apocytochrome P450scc was employed as a model protein. When imported into isolated yeast mitochondria, P450scc was mislocalized to the matrix and rapidly degraded. This proteolytic breakdown was mediated by the ATP-dependent PIM1 protease, a Lon-like protease in the mitochondrial matrix, in cooperation with the mtHsp70 system. In addition, a derivative of P450scc was studied to which a heterologous transmembrane region was fused at the amino terminus. This protein became anchored to the inner membrane upon import and was degraded by the membrane-embedded, ATP-dependent m-AAA protease. Again, degradation depended on the mtHsp70 system; it was inhibited at non-permissive temperature in mitochondria carrying temperature-sensitive mutant forms of Ssc1p, Mdj1p, or Mge1p. These results demonstrate overlapping substrate specificities of PIM1 and them-AAA protease, and they assign a central role to the mtHsp70 system during the degradation of misfolded polypeptides by both proteases."

Alkaline phosphatase treatment and metabolic labeling in [32P]orthophosphate experiments revealed that PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated in vivo, resulting in a shift in its electrophoretic mobility. Phosphorylation is induced by treatment of mitogens such as serum and epidermal growth factor. Immunostaining experiments and subcellular fractionation revealed that PIPKIIγ localizes dominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Phosphorylation also occurs in the ER.

The variations in its function and the regulation of its synthesis indicate that enzymes responsible for the production of PIP2, such as PI kinase and PIPK, also show large diversities. Among PIPKs, two major subtypes (types I and II), each comprising two isoforms (Iα, Iβ, IIα, and IIβ), have been identified to date (13Castellino A.M. Parker G.J. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A.

Human PIPKIβ has been shown to be identical to theSTM7 gene, the putative gene responsible for Friedreich's ataxia, suggesting that this isozyme plays roles in vesicular trafficking such as neurotransmitter release (11Carvajal J.J.

On the other hand, type II isozymes have also been reported to have several functionsin vivo. In platelets, PIPKIIα was shown to translocate to the cytoskeletal fraction after stimulation by thrombin (12Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). PIPKIIβ was identified by its specific interaction with a cytoplasmic region of the p55 tumor necrosis factor-α receptor, and a role for PIPK in tumor necrosis factor-α signaling has been suggested (13Castellino A.M.

Here, we identify a novel PIPKII isozyme (PIPKIIγ) by a reverse transcription-PCR method using degenerate primers designed from highly conserved primary sequences in PIPK family members. PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated on serine residues in vivo, resulting in a mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Mitogenic stimulation, such as by serum, EGF, or PDGF treatment, results in phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ. The results of immunofluorescence experiments and subcellular fractionation suggest that PIPKIIγ has important roles in the production of PIP2 in the ER. PIPs were purified by neomycin column chromatography from crude phospholipids extracted from bovine spinal cord as described (14Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]orthophosphate, and [3H]PI(4,5)P2 were from NEN Life Science Products. The Colony/ PlaqueScreen used to screen the cDNA library was from NEN Life Science Products. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes used for Western blot analysis were from Nihon Eido (Tokyo, Japan). Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose was from QIAGEN Inc. (Chatsworth, CA). The Partisphere SAX column was from Whatman International Ltd. (Maidstone, United Kingdom). The thin-layer chromatography silica plates and the cellulose plate used to separate phospholipids and phosphoamino acids, respectively, were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Monoclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-BiP antibody was from Stressgen Biotech Corp. Monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody was from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA). Rhodamine- and fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and fluorescein-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody were from Organon Teknika Corp. (West Chester, PA). Rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). COS-7 and 3Y1 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. PC12 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Total RNA isolated from rat brain was reverse-transcribed into cDNA by murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and used as a template for PCR using degenerate primers (5′-GAITAYTGYCCIRWIGTITTYMG-3′, 5′-ATICYIABIAIIARRCTRTARTCCAT-3′, and 5′-ATICYIABIAIIARIGARTARTCCAT-3′) corresponding to two highly conserved sequences in mammalian and yeast PIPKs ((D/E)YCPXVFR and MDYSLLLG(I/M)). The polymerase chain reaction was carried out as follows: 95 °C for 1 min, 43 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, for 40 cycles. The PCR product, ∼500 base pairs long, was subcloned into the SmaI site of the pBluescript SK(−) vector and sequenced. The PCR product encoding a novel sequence was cut out from the vector with EcoRI andBamHI, labeled with [α-32P]dCTP, and used as a probe for screening a rat brain cDNA library. The longest clone obtained (∼2.4 kilobases) encoded an open reading frame as long as ∼400 amino acids, but did not include a potent start codon. On the other hand, another partial clone was obtained that included a potent start codon preceded by a sequence consistent with a Kozak consensus sequence (15Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar), but did not include a stop codon. From the sequences of these two clones, we could determine the complete sequence for this novel PIPK. A partial fragment corresponding to 418–1500 base pairs of cDNA was labeled and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Hybridization was carried out on mouse multiple tissue Northern blot membrane (MTNTM,CLONTECH). A partial fragment encoding amino acids 130–420 was ligated into thePstI-HindIII site of a pQE32 His tag expression vector (QIAGEN Inc.). The His-tagged protein was expressed inEscherichia coli and purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described by the manufacturer. The purified protein was injected as an antigen into rabbits to raise polyclonal antiserum. The resulting antibody was affinity-purified with the antigen protein transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane or immobilized on a Hi-Trap NHS-activated column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The full-length cDNAs of mouse PIPKIβ and rat PIPKIIβ and PIPKIIγ were ligated into theSalI-BamHI site of pCMV-Myc or theXhoI-BamHI site of pSRαXEBNeo mammalian expression vectors. Twenty micrograms of each plasmid was mixed with 1 × 107 cells, and the mixtures were subjected to electroporation with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Forty-eight hours after electroporation, the expression vector-transfected COS-7 cells were lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaF, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The expressed enzyme was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody and washed three times with lysis buffer and once with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA). The reaction was started by adding 50 μm PIP, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 50 μl. After incubating for 10 min at room temperature, the lipids were extracted with 1 n HCl and chloroform/methanol (2:1, by volume) and spotted on TLC plates. The plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/ammonia/water (14:20:3:5, by volume), and the products were observed by autoradiography or quantified by a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Phosphoinositides separated by TLC were scraped out, deacylated, and analyzed by SAX HPLC as described (19Serunian L.A. Auger K.R. Cantley L.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 198: 78-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). A partial fragment corresponding to 1084–3947 base pairs of the cDNA of human Src homology domain-containing inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase (SHIP) was cut out with SalI and BamHI and ligated into the SalI-BamHI site of pCMV-Myc. The resulting expression vector was transfected into COS-7 cells as described above. Myc-SHIP was immunoprecipitated, and the dephosphorylation of lipids was carried out in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 10 mm MgCl2 at 37 °C for 60 min. The lipids were extracted and separated by TLC (chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water, 43:38:5:7, by volume). Myc-tagged PIPKIIγ was immunoprecipitated from the lysate of overexpressing COS-7 cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed first with lysis buffer and then with alkaline phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), after which 2 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) or storage buffer for calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm MgCl2, 50 mmKCl, 0.1 mm ZnCl2, and 50% glycerol) was added. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 60 min. The culture medium was changed to phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the PC12 cells were cultured for 30 min. [32P]Orthophosphate (0.2 mCi/ml) was then added, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. Labeled cells were lysed in lysis buffer, and PIPKIIγ was immunoprecipitated with anti-PIPKIIγ antibody and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The band corresponding to PIPKIIγ was cut out and hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl for 1 h at 110 °C. The resulting amino acids, together with standard phosphoamino acids, were spotted on TLC plates and separated by electrophoresis in pH 3.5 buffer (5% acetic acid and 0.5% pyridine). The labeled phosphoamino acids were detected by autoradiography. The positions of the standard phosphoamino acids were detected by ninhydrin staining. Cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Incubation with the first antibody (polyclonal anti-PIPKIIγ and monoclonal anti-BiP) was carried out for 1 h, and incubation with the second antibody or rhodamine-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin for 30 min. The cells were observed with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Bio-Rad). The subcellular fractionation was performed as described (20Nigam S.K. Blobel G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16927-16932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Rat liver or 3Y1 fibroblasts were homogenized in 0.25 m sucrose, 50 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium acetate, 6 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. After centrifugation at 800 ×g for 10 min and 10,000 × g for 10 min to devoid nuclei and mitochondria, respectively, the “post-mitochondrial” supernatant was obtained. The supernatant was layered over a cushion of 1.3 m sucrose in the same buffer and centrifuged at 202,000 × g for 2.5 h to yield three distinct fractions: the “post-microsomal” supernatant (representing the cytosol), interfacial “smooth microsomes” (representing the smooth ER and the Golgi apparatus), and the “rough microsomal” pellet (representing the rough ER). To identify novel PIPKs, we applied a reverse transcription-PCR method using degenerate primers corresponding to amino acid sequences highly conserved among mammalian PIPKs and their putative yeast homologs, Mss4p and Fab1p. Total RNA isolated from rat brain was reverse-transcribed and used as a template for further PCR. The PCR product was subcloned into the pBluescript vector and sequenced. Among several sequences corresponding to known PIPKs, one novel sequence homologous to the type II isoform of PIPK was obtained. We then tried to isolate a full-length cDNA using this fragment as a probe. By screening a rat brain cDNA library including random-primed clones, we obtained two clones encoding overlapping sequences. Between these clones, we found an open reading frame of 1260 base pairs encoding 420 amino acids (Fig.1 A). The calculated molecular mass is 47,048 Da.Figure 1Sequence of novel type II PIPK and comparison with other type II isoforms. A, cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences of novel PIPKIIγ.

Thus, we propose that this novel PIPK be called type IIγ (PIPKIIγ). Alignment of the amino acid sequences between type II PIPKs revealed that PIPKIIγ has a highly conserved kinase homology domain separated by an insert domain showing no similarity to other PIPK family members (18Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To study the tissue distribution of PIPKIIγ, Northern hybridization was carried out on mRNA from various mouse tissues. An mRNA of ∼3.5 kilobases was detected in almost all tissues, with the most abundant expression in kidney (Fig. 2). The pattern of distribution is different from that of any type I isoform or any other type II isoform (13Castellino A.M. Parker G.J. Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. Chao M.V. J. Biol.

We transfected a Myc-tagged version of the full-length cDNA of PIPKIIγ (Myc-PIPKIIγ) into COS-7 cells. The protein expressed in the whole cell lysate and the anti-Myc immunoprecipitate was detected in a doublet form by Western blotting with anti-Myc antibody (Fig.3 A and discussed further below). Myc-PIPKIIγ was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody, and the PIPK activity was measured. The immunoprecipitate phosphorylated PIP purified from bovine spinal cord (see “Experimental Procedures”), whereas anti-Myc immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with vector alone failed to do so (Fig.3 B). By using SAX HPLC, the resulting PIP2 was confirmed to be PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3 C). Recently, Rameh et al. (21Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) showed that the PIPKIIα is a PI5P 4-kinase and slightly different from a PI4P 5-kinase. To examine whether PIPKIIγ is a PIP 4- or 5-kinase, [32P]PI(4,5)P2 produced from the mixture of PI4P and PI5P by PIPKIIγ was treated with SHIP, which has been reported to dephosphorylate preferentially position 5 of PI(4,5)P2 (21Rameh L.E.

Upon SHIP treatment, the [32P]PI(4,5)P2 spot was decreased, whereas a [32P]PIP spot appeared (Fig. 3 D). This [32P]PIP was confirmed to be [32P]PI4P by SAX HPLC (Fig. 3 E). The same [32P]PI4P spot was also detected when [32P]PI(4,5)P2produced by PIPKIIβ was used (Fig. 3 D). On the other hand, [32P]PI(4,5)P2 produced by PIPKIβ did not show any [32P]PI4P spot visible in a short exposure. But the long exposure showed a [32P]PIP spot (Fig.3 D), which might represent [32P]PI5P produced by a weak 4-phosphatase activity of SHIP (21Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The identification of the [32P]PI5P spot was also carried out by SAX HPLC (Fig.3 E). These results indicate that PIPKIIγ is a PI5P 4-kinase, like other type II isoforms. A polyclonal antibody was produced with a partial His-tagged protein expressed in E. coli as an antigen. With this polyclonal antibody, endogenous PIPKIIγ was detected as doublet bands at 47 kDa in lysates from rat brain, PC12 cells, and 3Y1 fibroblasts by Western blotting (Fig.4 A). When the full-length cDNA (without the Myc tag) was transfected into COS-7 cells, the same doublet band was detected (Fig. 4 A), suggesting that this doublet corresponds to some modification of PIPKIIγ such as proteolysis or phosphorylation and is not due to cross-reactivity of the antibody to another protein. To examine the possibility that these doublet bands correspond to phosphorylated PIPKIIγ, we treated the Myc-tagged version of PIPKIIγ with alkaline phosphatase. The Myc-PIPKIIγ that was immunoprecipitated from overexpressing COS-7 cells showed a doublet banding pattern with the upper band predominant. When the immunoprecipitated Myc-PIPKIIγ was incubated with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase, the upper band disappeared completely (Fig. 4 B), whereas the lower band increased in intensity. This indicates that the doublet migrating pattern is due to the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ. To confirm this conclusion, we next labeled PC12 cells metabolically with [32P]orthophosphate. After labeling, the ells were lysed, and PIPKIIγ was immunoprecipitated, showing that PIPKIIγ was phosphorylated (Fig. 4 C). Together with the results of Western blotting, it was confirmed that this phosphorylated protein corresponds to the upper band of PIPKIIγ (Fig.4 C). Next, the phosphorylated band was cut out from membrane, and phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out. The results show that PIPKIIγ phosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine residues (Fig. 4 D). To determine whether the enzymatic activity of PIPKIIγ is affected by its phosphorylation, we measured the activity of Myc-PIPKIIγ after alkaline phosphatase treatment. Myc-PIPKIIγ retained considerable activity even after alkaline phosphatase treatment (Fig. 4 E), indicating that the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ does not affect its enzymatic activity. In response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors or hormones, intracellular protein kinases are activated and phosphorylate their physiological substrates. Since PIPKIIγ was found to be phosphorylated on serine residues in vivo, we examined whether the level of PIPKIIγ phosphorylation is potentiated by extracellular stimuli. First, we treated rat 3Y1 fibroblasts with 10% serum for various periods. The upper band of PIPKIIγ increased in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated in response to serum (Fig.5 A). We then examined other extracellular stimuli including EGF, PDGF, bradykinin, and lysophosphatidic acid for their abilities to induce the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ. Among them, EGF and PDGF enhanced the phosphorylation as well as serum (Fig. 5, B and C). Lysophosphatidic acid and bradykinin also induced phosphorylation to a lesser extent. Fig. 4 D clearly shows that PIPKIIγ phosphorylation does not take place on tyrosine residues. Moreover, PIPKIIγ was not recognized by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, PY20 (data not shown). Therefore, it seems likely that the phosphorylation is mediated by a serine/threonine kinase downstream of mitogenic signals mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases. Protein kinase C does not seem to be involved since phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not potentiate phosphorylation (Fig. 5, B and C). In addition, a specific protein kinase C inhibitor, H-7, did not suppress phosphorylation in 3Y1 cells (data not shown). Using a polyclonal antibody, we next examined the intracellular localization of PIPKIIγ. The polyclonal antibody used was confirmed to recognize specifically the doublet band corresponding to PIPKIIγ in 3Y1 cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A). When rat 3Y1 fibroblasts were stained, PIPKIIγ was seen to predominate in the perinuclear regions, suggesting that it is localized in microsomal organelles such as the ER. To confirm this possibility, we double-stained rat 3Y1 fibroblasts with anti-PIPKIIγ antibody and with anti-BiP antibody, an ER-retaining protein. Both staining patterns (Fig. 6 A) clearly indicate the localization of this enzyme in the ER. This staining pattern does not overlap with that of wheat germ agglutinin, a trans-Golgi staining reagent (Fig. 6 A). The intracellular localization of PIPKIIγ was studied further by a subcellular fractionation method using a 1.3 m sucrose cushion (see “Experimental Procedures”). PIPKIIγ was detected in smooth and rough microsomal fractions of rat liver the same as the ER marker BiP, whereas a cytosolic protein, β-tubulin, was detected only in the top of the gradient (Fig. 6 B). The phosphorylated form of PIPKIIγ was also detected in these fractions, suggesting that phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ occurred in microsomes. To confirm this possibility, post-mitochondrial supernatants of 3Y1 fibroblasts were subjected to the same subcellular fractionation after mitogenic stimulations. PIPKIIγ, together with BiP, was detected predominantly in the smooth microsomal fraction (Fig. 6 C). On stimulation by EGF, the phosphorylated form increased in this fraction, indicating that the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ occurred within the ER (Fig. 6 C). In addition, immunofluorescence staining also showed that the localization of PIPKIIγ in the ER was not affected by stimulation of the cells with serum or EGF (data not shown). These results indicate that PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated in the ER in response to mitogenic signals, thus suggesting that it has important roles in the synthesis of PIP2 in the ER. Purification and cDNA cloning of the 53-kDa PIPKIIα from erythrocytes revealed that the lipid kinase belongs to a distinct kinase family different from those of PI 3- and PI 4-kinases and protein kinases (16Boronenkov I.V. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2881-2884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This family also seems to include yeast homologs such as Mss4p and Fab1p. Furthermore, cDNA cloning of types Iα and Iβ, members of another subtype of mammalian PIPK, also showed them to belong to this same distinct lipid kinase family (17Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar,18Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32937-32943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Members of this novel lipid kinase family have several conserved regions within their primary sequences. Using a reverse transcription-PCR method involving degenerate primers corresponding to these highly conserved sequences, we succeeded in identifying a novel PIPK isoform and named it PIPKIIγ. Although PIPKIIγ seems to belong to the type II subtype, the similarity between PIPKIIγ and other members of the type II PIPK family is not very high (61.1% for IIα and 63.3% for IIβ) compared with the homology between PIPKIIα and PIPKIIβ (76.7%). This, together with the difference in its expression pattern from that of other PIPKs, suggests that PIPKIIγ has some distinct functionsin vivo. PIPKIIγ was detected as a doublet migrating protein by Western blotting with a specific polyclonal antibody not only in rat brain lysates, but also in 3Y1 fibroblasts and PC12 cells. The same doublet patterns were also observed when PIPKIIγ was overexpressed in COS-7 cells. The evidence presented in this study shows that PIPKIIγ is phosphorylated in vivo and that the upper band represents the phosphorylated form. Furthermore, phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that phosphorylation occurs predominantly on serine residues. We also observed that mitogens such as serum and growth factors immediately induced phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ. The total cellular amount of PIP2 and the PIPK activity have been reported to increase in response to various extracellular stimuli, including EGF (5Payrastre B. Plantavid M. Breton M. Chambaz E. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 665-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, platelet-activating factor (1Stephens L. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), thrombin (22Grondin P. Plantavid M. Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15705-15709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), phorbol ester (4Halenda S.P. Feinstein M.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and adhesion to fibronectin (6McNamee H.P. Ingber D.E. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 673-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Some of these extracellular stimuli have been reported to increase PIPK activity, especially in the cytoskeleton. In addition, the involvement of G-proteins, including small GTPases such as Rac and Rho, has also been suggested by data showing that the PIPK activity is potentiated by non-hydrolyzable GTP or is associated with recombinant Rho and Rac proteins. Despite the above observations, the exact molecular mechanism by which PIPK is regulated has not been made clear. Here, we provide evidence for the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ. It is possible that PIPK is regulated by a protein kinase downstream of extracellular stimuli. At present, we do not know what kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation. The phosphorylation was found to be enhanced by tyrosine kinase activators such as EGF and PDGF rather than activators related to triplet G-protein-coupled signalings, such as bradykinin and lysophosphatidic acid. Moreover, dibutyryl cAMP (data not shown) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not increase the phosphorylation markedly. Considering that phosphorylation occurs on serine residues rather than on tyrosine residues, a serine kinase, other than protein kinase A or C, downstream of a tyrosine kinase must phosphorylate PIPKIIγ. Although the exact roles of the phosphorylation remain unclear, it is possible that the phosphorylation of PIPKIIγ regulates its localization. Hinchliffe et al. (12Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6516-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) reported that the translocation of PIPKIIα to the cytoskeletal fraction of platelets in response to thrombin is inhibited by okadaic acid treatment, suggesting the importance of dephosphorylation for translocation. Although they also showed that the activity of PIPKIIα is regulated by its phosphorylation state (23Hinchliffe K.A. Irvine R.F. Divecha N. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we did not observe any change in the activity of PIPKIIγ after phosphorylation by mitogenic stimulation or dephosphorylation by alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 4 E and data not shown). In this study, we demonstrated that PIPKIIγ is specifically localized in the ER in rat 3Y1 fibroblasts. Although most PIPK activity is found in the plasma membrane and cytosol, Helms et al. (24Helms J.B. de Vries K.J. Wirtz K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that PI(4,5)P2 synthesis occurs in the ER. Several phosphoinositide-metabolizing enzymes have been reported to be localized in the microsomal fraction. Wong et al. (25Wong K. Meyers R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13236-13241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) reported that PI 4-kinase α is localized in the ER, whereas PI 4-kinase β is localized in the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. Most PI synthase activity is also detected in the ER (24Helms J.B. de Vries K.J. Wirtz K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21368-21374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lundberg G.A.

Acta. 1990; 1022: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that PI(4,5)P2 synthesis occurs efficiently in microsomes because of the relay of substrates between PI synthase, PI kinase, and PIPK. In addition, PI5P, the preferential substrate for type II isozymes in PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, is rare in NIH3T3 cells (21Rameh L.E. Tolias K.F. Duckworth B.C. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 390: 192-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) compared with PI4P, which exits abundantly in the cell. It may be important for this minor phosphoinositide to be localized in a restricted area such as in microsomes with its metabolizing enzyme, PI5P 4-kinase, for efficient PI(4,5)P2 synthesis. Many of the characteristics of PI5P have yet to be elucidated, including its synthetic pathway as well as the identity of PI 5-kinase and its exact intracellular localization. However, together with the observation that PIPKIIγ is localized in the ER after phosphorylation by mitogenic signals, our results suggest that PIPKIIγ is involved in the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 in the ER. Shibasaki et al. (28Shibasaki Y. Ishihara H. Kizuki N. Asano T. Oka Y. Yazaki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7578-7581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) reported that the type I PI4P 5-kinase overexpressed in COS-7 cells by an adenovirus expression system is localized mainly in plasma membranes and the cytosol. They further reported that type I PIPKs induce a pine needle-like structure of the actin cytoskeleton downstream from Rho. In contrast, we observed no change in the actin cytoskeleton when type IIβ and IIγ isozymes were transiently overexpressed in COS-7 cells (data not shown). From these results, it is possible to conclude that each subfamily of PIPK has a distinct localization and function and is also responsible for the synthesis of distinct intracellular PIP2 sources.

Difference absorption spectra generated from addition of ATP-Mg to the isolated subunits revealed that the A subunit can bind ATP-Mg, whereas the B subunit cannot. The inability to bind ATP-Mg is consistent with the absence of Walker motifs in the B subunit. These results indicate that the inactivation of the V<sub>1</sub>-ATPase during ATP hydrolysis is caused by entrapping inhibitory ADP-Mg in a catalytic site. Light-driven ATP synthesis by bacteriorhodopsin-V<sub>o</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-ATPase proteoliposomes was observed, and the rate of ATP synthesis was approximately constant. ATP synthesis occurred in the presence of an ADP-Mg of which concentration was high enough to induce complete inactivation of ATP hydrolysis of V<sub>o</sub>V<sub>1</sub>-ATPase.

https://openalex.org/W2121742239,"All integrin α subunits contain a highly conserved KXGFFKR motif in their cytoplasmic domains that plays a crucial role in the regulation of integrin affinity for their ligands. We show that a lipid-modified peptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic region, 989–995, of the platelet integrin subunit glycoprotein GpIIb (αIIb), palmitoyl-KVGFFKR (Ppep; 10 μm), but not a similarly modified scrambled peptide (palmitoyl-FKFVRGK), can specifically induce platelet activation and aggregation equivalent to that of strong agonists such as thrombin. Ppep-induced aggregation is also associated with indices of platelet activation including thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesis (EC50 = 45 ± 5 μm), secretion of α-granules detected as enhanced surface expression of P-selectin (EC50 = 52 ± 8 μm), and conformational changes in GpIIb/IIIa measured by the monoclonal antibody, PAC-1 (EC50 = 3.7 ± 1 μm). The TXA2 receptor antagonist, SQ29548, PGE1, and the ADP scavenger, apyrase, differentially inhibit the aggregation response and TXA2 synthesis in response to Ppep. Similarly, GpIIb/IIIa antagonists (RO-449883 and integrelin), which inhibit aggregation by greater than 90%, have little effect on peptide-induced TXA2 synthesis, suggesting that this event is independent of fibrinogen binding to GpIIb/IIIa. Alanine-stepping of the Ppep sequence identifies GFFK(991–994) as the critical residues in all peptide-mediated events. We conclude that this peptide can imitate the cytoplasmic domain of GpIIb and initiate parallel but independent signaling pathways, one leading to ligand binding and platelet aggregation and the other to intracellular signaling events such as TXA2 synthesis and secretion.

Integrins are a family of cell adhesion molecules composed of two subunits, α and β, which form a complex on the cell surface. Ligand recognition by integrins may be modulated by intracellular signals that interact with the cytoplasmic tails of the subunits. This has been demonstrated most clearly for the platelet glycoprotein (Gp) 1The abbreviations used are: GpglycoproteinPGE1prostaglandin E1Ppeppalmitoyl-KVGFFKR.1The abbreviations used are: GpglycoproteinPGE1prostaglandin E1Ppeppalmitoyl-KVGFFKR.

Mori P.G. Recenti Prog. Med. 1992; 83: 100-104PubMed Google Scholar). However, when platelets are stimulated by agonists such as thrombin or ADP, GpIIb/IIIa undergoes a conformational change (3Du X.

The cytoplasmic domains are also important for events occurring as a consequence of ligand-integrin interactions, so-called “outside-in” signaling. In the case of GpIIb/IIIa, ligand binding and receptor clustering is followed by an array of intracellular signals including thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation and tyrosine phosphorylation events (10Shattil S.J.

After ligand binding, GpIIb/IIIa becomes tightly associated with the membrane skeleton as focal contact structures form, composed of several cytoskeletal elements including talin, vinculin, and spectrin. Potential signaling molecules such as pp60c-src, pp62c-yes, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and protein kinase C also associate with these focal contact structures (12Fox J.E. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Several sites within the cytoplasmic tail of the two integrin subunits have been implicated in this process (14Haas T.A. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

However, deletion or mutation of this region also modifies ligand recognition by the integrin and presumably, the conformation of the receptor, which will impact upon cellular events after ligand occupancy. Moreover, since modified integrins cannot be analyzed in native cells, it is necessary to study their functions in transfected cells that may not have a full complement of signaling molecules. As an alternative approach, we have examined the functional effects of a synthetic peptide sequence corresponding to the conserved amino acid motif on intact, human platelets. Our findings demonstrate that a lipid-soluble peptide, palmitoyl-KVGFFKR mediates platelet activation in a highly specific manner and identifies a component of GpIIb that is involved in thromboxane formation independent of fibrinogen binding or platelet aggregation.

PAC-1 fluorescein isothiocyanate was obtained from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Vectashield mounting medium for fluorescence was obtained from Vector Laboratories Inc. (Burlingame, CA). CD62P (anti-GMP-140) was obtained as a phosphatidylethanolamine conjugate from Cymbus Corporation (Hants, UK). TXB2 enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay kits were obtained from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI)). The GpIIb/IIIa antagonist Integrelin was obtained from COR Therapeutics, (San Francisco, CA). RO44 9883 (1-(N-(p-amidinobenzoyl)l-tyrosyl)-4-piperidinyl) oxy) acetic acid) was a gift from Dr. S. Roux of Hoffman LaRoche (Basle, Switzerland). All other materials were reagent grade or better. Deionized water (Purite, grade 1) was used throughout all experiments. A peptide corresponding to the membrane proximal portion of the GpIIb cytoplasmic tail containing the amino acid sequence K989-R995 (KVGFFKR) and a scrambled version of this sequence (FKFVRGK) were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems automated peptide synthesizer (model 432A, Norwalk, CT) using a standard solid-phase Fmoc procedure. Corresponding peptides palmitoylated on the amino-terminal amino acid were also synthesized in an identical manner. Portions of both KVGFFKR and palmitoylated-KVGFFKR were subsequently labeled with carboxyfluorescein and used in immunofluorescent assays. Sequential alanine-substituted palmitoylated-peptides (Palmitoyl-AVGFFKR [Ppep K989A], Palmitoyl-KAGFFKR [Ppep V990A], Palmitoyl-KVAFFKR [Ppep G991A], Palmitoyl-KVGAFKR [Ppep F992A], Palmitoyl-KVGFAKR [Ppep F993A], Palmitoyl-KVGFFAR [Ppep K994A] and Palmitoyl-KVGFFKA [Ppep R995A]) were also synthesized. All peptides were purified after synthesis using reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography and confirmed using electrospray mass spectrometry. Platelets obtained from volunteers free from medication were collected into 0.15 vol./vol. acid-citrate-dextrose (ACD: 38 mm citric acid, 75 mm Na citrate, 124 mm dextrose) anticoagulant and washed using a modification of the method of Mendelsohn et al., 1991 (24Mendelsohn M. Zhu Y. O'Neill S. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11212-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, blood was centrifuged at 180 g for 10 min. at room temperature. Platelet-rich plasma was then acidified to pH 6.5 with ACD and PGE1 (1 μm) was added. The platelets were pelleted through plasma by centrifugation at 750 g for 10 min. at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the platelet pellet resuspended in 130 mm NaCl, 10 mm trisodium citrate, 9 mm NaHCO3, 6 mm dextrose, 0.9 mm MgCl2, 0.81 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm Tris pH 7.4, adjusted to 2 × 108/ml and supplemented with 1.8 mm CaCl2. Platelet aggregations were performed at 37 °C in a BioData PAP-4 aggregometer (Horsham, PA). Peptide was dissolved in deionized water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and used at the concentrations indicated to induce aggregation. Thrombin (0.2units/ml) or thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP; 10 μm; SFLLRN) were used as positive controls in all experiments. Aliquots for TXB2 analysis were snap frozen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. Near-confluent human erythroleukemic (HEL) cells (25Thiagarajan P. Shapiro S.S. Sweterlitsch L. McCord S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 924: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were cultured overnight on Falcon culture Slides™ in the presence of 10 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in standard tissue culture medium (10% fetal calf serum in DMEM) in order to facilitate adhesion of these platelet-like cells which normally grow in suspension. Alternate slides were incubated for 1–2 min with 45 μmcarboxyfluorescein-labeled KVGFFKR or carboxyfluorescein-labeled, palmitoylated-KVGFFKR. The slides were washed three times by immersion in phosphate-buffered saline and then mounted in vectashield-mounting medium and analyzed on a Nikon diaphot 300 microscope with epifluorescent attachment using 400X magnification. Washed platelets were diluted to 2 × 108/ml and stimulated for 3 min whereas stirring in an aggregometer before being snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for analysis. Platelet TXA2 was measured as its stable metabolite TXB2 by ELISA (26FitzGerald G.A. Lawson J. Blair I.A. Brash A.R. Adv. Prostaglandin Thromboxane Leukotriene Res. 1985; 15: 87-90PubMed Google Scholar). Washed platelets were placed in the aggregometer at 37 °C in the presence or absence of thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP) (10 μm) or the indicated concentrations of Ppep and stirred for 3 min. 50 μl aliquots were then placed on ice and incubated with CD62P-phosphatidylethanolamine as a marker for α-granule degranulation (27Harrison P. Cramer E.M. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Parallel samples were incubated with PAC-1 fluorescein isothiocyanate to determine the activation status of GpIIb/IIIa. Incubations were for 30 min. Samples were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (phosphate-buffered saline/bovine serum albumin) and analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACS-Scan (San Jose, CA) at 488/510 nm. Controls were included in all assays and were obtained by incubating platelets as above in the presence of 20 μm TRAP or 0.2 units/ml thrombin (positive control) or in the absence of any agonist (negative control). Nonspecific binding was determined in control and activated platelets using a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled γ-1 mouse IgG. Data are expressed as percent positive cells for P-selectin assays and as mean fluorescence for PAC-1 assays. The membrane-proximal seven amino acids (Lys-989–Arg-995) of GpIIb were synthesized either as unmodified peptides or as palmitoylated isoforms and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Peptide purity was ascertained by electrospray mass spectrometry and was routinely >99%. Unmodified KVGFFKR had no effect on platelets. However, the addition of a palmitate group to the peptide increased its lipid permeability and permitted an interaction with intracellular components of the platelet. Palmitoylated peptide (Ppep45 μm), but not equal concentrations of palmitate alone, KVGFFKR alone, or palmitate plus unconjugated KVGFFKR caused aggregation in washed human platelets (Fig.1 A). There was a lag time of between 10 and 20 s before the initiation of aggregation. No obvious shape change response was observed in this time period. Palmitoylated scrambled peptide (P-FKFVRGK), even at higher concentrations (120 μm), failed to cause significant platelet aggregation (Fig. 1 B). To establish if the peptide was gaining access to the platelet cytoplasmic milieu, carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides were synthesized with and without the palmitate modification. In Fig.2, we show that only the palmitoylated peptide can be observed in the cytoplasm of HEL cells, a platelet-like, human megakaryocyte cell line (25Thiagarajan P. Shapiro S.S. Sweterlitsch L. McCord S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 924: 127-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). No fluorescence was observed in cells incubated with carboxyfluorescein-labeled KVGFFKR that lacked the lipid modification. Similarly, flow cytometric analysis of either HEL cells or platelets shows that only the palmitoylated, fluoresceinated peptide had significant cellular association (Fig. 2, c andd). Access of labeled Ppep to cells is independent of the presence of GpIIb/IIIa, as excess of either Ppep or palmitoylated scrambled peptide compete equally for label uptake into cells. Furthermore, we have evidence of Ppep uptake into cells that do not express GpIIb/IIIa, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (data not shown). Ppep-induced aggregation was acutely dose-dependent and was maximal at 10 μm (Fig.3 a). Platelet aggregation induced by Ppep, like that caused by thrombin, was accompanied by TXA2 synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3 b). The maximum response determined by Michaelis-Menton kinetics was 644.5 ± 49.22 ng/ml TXB2, with half-maximal effect (EC50) at 45 μm peptide. Ppep-induced thromboxane formation was paralleled by secretion, which can be measured by expression of the α-granular marker, CD62P or P-selectin (27Harrison P. Cramer E.M. Blood Rev. 1993; 7: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), on the surface of the platelet (Fig. 3 b). The EC50 for this effect was 52 μm, which corresponded to 41.3 ± 14% positive cells compared with 0.5 ± 3.1% positive cells in untreated, control platelets. The disparity in the EC50 values for the signaling pathways (45–52 μm; thromboxane synthesis and secretion) compared with the dose of Ppep that produces a maximal aggregation response (10 μm) would suggest a different mechanism of activation for these respective events. Finally, Ppep induced PAC-1 expression (Fig.3 c) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This antibody recognizes an epitope on the GpIIb/IIIa complex that is exposed after platelet activation, permitting fibrinogen binding (4Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To define the membrane-proximal residues of the IIb subunit important for the aggregating activity of this peptide, we sequentially substituted each residue in the peptide with alanine (Ala). The Ala-stepped peptides were then assayed for their ability to induce platelet aggregation, and samples were analyzed in parallel for TXA2 production (Fig. 4). Platelet aggregation activity was lost in Ppep G991A, Ppep F992A, Ppep F993A, and Ppep K994A. In contrast, activity was present but submaximal in Ppeps K989A, V990A, and R995A. A parallel profile of activity was observed for TXA2 synthesis activity with the Ala-stepped peptides. Thus, TXA2 synthesis and aggregation seem to be associated facets of Ppep stimulation. To explore the mechanisms of Ppep-induced platelet activation, we examined the response to several inhibitors (Fig.5). SQ29 548, a highly specific thromboxane receptor antagonist (10 μm), reduced platelet aggregation by 63% but did not abolish it. Similarly, apyrase (10 units/ml), an ADP scavenger, reduced platelet aggregation by 73%. Aggregation was also only partially inhibited by PGE1 (5 μm), a concentration that abolished responses to thrombin (0.2 units/ml). These findings demonstrate that platelet aggregation was augmented by the formation of TXA2 and the release of ADP but was not initiated by these events. Similarly, Ppep-induced platelet activation is not mediated via the activation of a G-protein-dependent mechanism as these events are inhibited by PGE1. Thus it would appear that Ppep directly induces a high affinity state in GpIIb/IIIa and this is responsible for initiating the intracellular signaling events and platelet aggregation. Moreover, none of the inhibitors used altered TXA2formation, suggesting a dissociation between aggregation and TXA2 synthesis. Consistent with this, two GpIIb/IIIa antagonists, RO 449883 (28Jones C.R. Ambros R.J. Rapold H.J. Steiner B. Weller T. vanHeiningen P. Crijins H.J. Jonkman J.H. Hadvary P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 560AGoogle Scholar) and integrelin (29Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. du Mee C.P. Wolf D. Philips D.R. Swift R.L. Circulation. 1992; 86 (abst.): 1034Google Scholar), suppressed platelet aggregation by greater than 90% but had no effect on TXA2formation. The KXGFFKR sequence is common to α subunits of integrins and appears critical for receptor function. Deletion or mutation analysis directed against this motif suggests that this sequence or a factor binding to it is critical for maintaining the integrin in its low affinity binding state (15Leong L. Hughes P.E. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3817-3825PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J.

Fibrinolysis. 1996; 7: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, deletion of the KVGFFKR sequence in GpIIb/IIIa results in a constitutively active receptor capable of recognizing its ligand and binding it with high affinity. This cytoplasmic segment also recognizes intracellular proteins that may play a role in signal transduction such as calreticulin (20Coppolino M. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Dedhar S. Wilkins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23132-23138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 4651-4654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We synthesized the peptide KVGFFKR and added a palmitoyl group to facilitate its access to the intraplatelet milieu, an approach that has been successful with other peptides (32Brucher K.H. Garten W. Klenk H.D. Shaw E. Radsak K. Virology. 1990; 178: 617-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 33Stieneke-Grober A. Vey M. Angliker H. Shaw E. Thomas G. Roberts C. Klenk H.D. Garten W.

Nature. 1992; 360: 358-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrate, using carboxyfluorescein-labeled peptides, that only peptides modified with palmitate gained access to intracellular regions of HEL cells and platelets. Staining in HEL cells was homogeneously distributed within the entire cytoplasmic area and was notably absent from the nuclear region. The palmitoylated peptide, at concentrations as low as 10 μm, induced platelet activation and aggregation, whereas a scrambled peptide, similarly palmitoylated, had no effect even at concentrations as high as 120 μm. Unconjugated peptide, in the presence or absence of equimolar amounts of free palmitate, had no effect on platelet function, affirming that the peptide must gain access to intracellular sites for biological effect. Neither palmitate alone or palmitoylated-scrambled peptide induced platelet aggregation, verifying that the effect on platelets was due to a specific Ppep-mediated response and not nonspecific effects such as to disruption of the cell membrane or cell lysis. Aggregation resulted from activation of GpIIb/IIIa as there was enhanced binding of the monoclonal antibody, PAC-1, which recognizes the active conformation of the integrin (4Shattil S.J. Hoxie J.A. Cunningham M. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, platelet aggregation was inhibited by integrelin and RO44 9883, highly specific GpIIb/IIIa antagonists, verifying that the aggregation response is dependent on activation of GpIIb/IIIa. The steep dose-response curve for Ppep-induced platelet aggregation reflects the inability of platelet aggregometry to detect small aggregates of platelets. Such aggregates can be observed by flow cytometry at doses as low as 2 μm Ppep as an increase in both forward and sideward scatter within the platelet population. The appearance of these small aggregates is accompanied by PAC-1 expression in a parallel manner. The EC50 for Ppep induction of PAC-1 binding was 3.7 ± 1.1 μm, and the maximum effect was achieved at 10 μm. To address which residues of the peptide were responsible for the biological activity, we sequentially replaced each amino acid with an alanine residue. The results showed that the response was highly specific and that the activity resided predominantly in the region GFFK corresponding to amino acids 991–994 of the GpIIb cytoplasmic tail. Mutation of the valine 990 resulted in a reduction in platelet aggregation, although the peptide was still active. This is interesting as this is the residue that varies most between different α integrins, suggesting that cell activation and signaling via this mechanism may be common to all integrins. In studies with the alanine-stepped palmitoylated peptides, the peptides that gave a poor reaction in platelet aggregation assays were also poor inducers of TXA2 synthesis. These data are in agreement with the mutational studies by Hughes et al. in which similar alanine substitution revealed identical critical residues for constitutive expression of PAC-1 binding (16Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). In addition to platelet aggregation, Ppep also induced platelet activation as measured by TXA2 formation and secretion of granular contents. However, the products of these positive feedback pathways are not the mediators of Ppep-induced platelet activation. This is proven by two separate observations. First, the EC50 values for Ppep-induced TXA2 synthesis and P-selectin expression are approximately 50 μm, whereas maximal aggregation occurs at 10 μm Ppep. Second, inhibitor studies show that agents that scavenge ADP or that prevent the actions of TXA2 only partially inhibited Ppep-induced aggregation. This finding indicates that secretion of ADP or synthesis of TXA2 augment but are not direct initiators of Ppep-induced aggregation. Conversely, fibrinogen binding or aggregation induced by Ppep do not directly cause TXA2 synthesis, as this pathway is unaltered by GpIIb/IIIa antagonists. Thus, it would appear that fibrinogen binding is not necessary for thromboxane synthesis to occur. In our studies, there is a possibility that the synthetic GpIIb/IIIa antagonists used are themselves acting as ligands and permitting outside-in signaling events to occur. In recognition of this possibility, we used two antagonists, integrelin and RO 449883, that differed in their abilities to expose ligand-induced binding sites and, hence, to act as partial ligands. Integrelin, a cyclic heptapeptide RGD mimetic (35Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arfsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Song A. Scarborough R.M. Phillips D.R. Adelman B. Strony J. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1410AGoogle Scholar), causes marked conformational changes in GpIIb/IIIa, exposing ligand-induced binding site epitopes (37Delanty N. Jennings L. Moran N. Catella F. FitzGerald G.A. Fitzgerald D.J. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1319AGoogle Scholar), whereas RO 449883 does not (38Steiner B. Haering P. Jennings L. Kouns W.C. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 69: 782AGoogle Scholar). Both antagonists inhibited platelet aggregation but not TXA2 synthesis. Identical results were also obtained using F(ab)′ fragments of the inhibiting monoclonal antibody, 7E3 (39Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 40Coller B.S. Anderson K. Weisman H.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, integrin occupancy by its ligand and integrin-initiated signaling may be distinguished as independent events. We conclude, therefore, that the interaction of Pal-KVGFFKR with GpIIb/IIIa represents a branch point in these two pathways such that both pathways require interaction with the peptide sequence and have the same intolerance to sequence mutation. Structure-function analysis pinpoints the region Gly-991–Lys-994 as the important region for these events. However, once the peptide has bound to its target, the processes of integrin ligation, clustering, and platelet aggregation proceed independently from the signaling pathways leading to TXA2 synthesis. Our findings demonstrate that KVGFFKR can both activate GpIIb/IIIa and induce intracellular signals independently. We propose a model where the sequence KVGFFKR in the cytoplasmic region of GpIIb, adjacent to the transmembrane region, provides a site for tethering the integrin and stabilizing it in a low affinity state. This is consistent with the deletion and mutational studies of O'Toole et al. (9O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar) and Hughes et al. (41Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ylanne J. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12411-12417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) and may be mediated through an interaction with signaling protein(s). Competition by the peptide displaces the stabilizing signaling factor, simultaneously activating the receptor by releasing it from its tether and allowing signaling to proceed via the tethering protein. An alternative possibility is that the KVGFFKR sequentially promotes receptor clustering and ligand binding. The occurrence of integrin clustering may lead to cell signaling, whereas ligand binding is necessary for aggregation. Consistent with this possibility is the recent observation that integrin clustering can mediate cell signaling independent of ligand binding (23Weitzman J.B. Pujades C. Hemler M.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In conclusion, structure-function analysis of the intracellular segment of the GpIIb subunit (Lys-989–Arg-995) using the cell-permeable peptide, Palmitoyl-KVGFFKR, pinpoints this motif and, in particular, the region Gly-991–Lys-994, as an important region in integrin signaling. This peptide substitutes for the endogenous GpIIb cytoplasmic tail and independently stimulates integrin ligation, leading to aggregation and platelet signaling events such as TXA2 synthesis and secretion.

Ramirez F. Milewicz D.M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 456-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Microfibrils have been suggested to function as a scaffold for elastin deposition to elastic fibers, but they are present also in matrix structures devoid of elastin (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 10Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar, 16Davis E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, gene-targeted mice expressing only mutated fibrillin-1 seem to assemble normal elastin matrix. These mice die of cardiovascular disorders at the age of 3 weeks (17Pereira L. Andrikopoulos K. Tian J. Lee S.Y. Keene D.R. Ono R. Reinhardt D.P. Sakai L.Y. Biery N.J. Bunton T. Dietz H.C. Ramirez F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).Fibrillins and LTBPs have similar domain structures. They are composed mainly of EGF and 8-cysteine repeats. EGF-like repeats are present in multiple extracellular proteins, and they presumably stabilize protein structure and mediate protein-protein interactions. The 8-Cys repeats are much more rare, and so far they have been found only in LTBPs and fibrillins. The 8-Cys repeats can bind to heterologous proteins via disulfide bridges, and the third 8-Cys repeat of LTBP-1 mediates the binding of LTBP-1 to latent TGF-β (18Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).TGF-βs are secreted from most cells as large latent complexes, which contain the homodimeric mature growth factor, TGF-β latency-associated protein, and a LTBP. LTBP-1 augments the secretion of latent TGF-β from cells (19Miyazono K. Olofsson A. Colosetti P. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1091-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and mediates its binding to the extracellular matrix (20Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Because there appears to be a molar excess of LTBPs compared with TGF-βs, it is likely that LTBPs have a structural role in the ECM, in addition to targeting growth factors to the ECM (21Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 22Dallas S.L. Miyazono K. Skerry T.M. Mundy G.R. Bonewald L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). LTBP-1 associates with the 10-nm microfibrils in the ECM. It also associates with thicker, ∼50-nm cell surface-associated fibers containing fibronectin (21Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 23Nakajima Y. Miyazono K. Kato M. Takase M. Yamagishi T. Nakamura H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fibrillin-1 and fibronectin can be found in similar structures in the endothelial cell pericellular matrix (16Davis E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). LTBP-2 is a structural component of the microfibrils of bovine ligamentum nuchae (4Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Davis E.C. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Mecham R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6932-6942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The association of LTBP-3 with the ECM has not been analyzed, but LTBP-4 is also a component of the ECM (6Saharinen J. Taipale J. Monni O. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18459-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Extracellular matrix is assembled, in principle, by two different mechanisms, self-assembly, e.g. collagen fibers (24Prockop D.J. Hulmes D.J.S. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 47-90Crossref Google Scholar), and cell-mediated assembly. Cell-mediated assembly can be further divided into two types on the basis of whether the cells are assembling soluble monomers diffusing around cells, as in the case of fibronectin (25Pesciotta Peters D.M. Mosher D.F. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 315-350Crossref Google Scholar), or the assembly is coupled directly to the surfaces of cells that make the monomers, which may be the mechanism for elastin matrix assembly (10Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). It is not clear whether microfibril assembly is a cell-mediated or a self-assembly process. Soluble members of the fibrillin/LTBP family have not been described in blood or tissue fluids. Fibrillins and LTBPs 1, 2, and 4 contain an RGD sequence, which mediates the adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix ligands via integrins (26Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3840) Google Scholar), and integrin αvβ3 mediates the binding of fibrillin-1 to cells (27Sakamoto H. Broekelmann T. Cheresh D.A. Ramirez F. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4916-4922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Microfibrils seem to associate with endothelial cell surfaces near structures called “dense plaques” (16Davis E.C. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 727-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Davis E.C. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 272: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether the association of microfibrils to integrins mediates cell adhesion to the ECM or is an event of microfibril assembly.Microfibrils are catabolized at least by elastase and certain other serine proteases. Of the integral microfibril proteins, serine proteases can cleave at least fibrillin-1 (29Kielty C.M. Woolley D.E. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). LTBP-1 can be released from the extracellular matrix as a ∼120-kDa fragment together with latent TGF-β, for example, by treatment of the matrices with plasmin or leukocyte elastase (20Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 30Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The N-terminal part of LTBP-1 mediates its binding to the ECM, whereas an 8-Cys repeat near the C terminus binds latent TGF-β (18Saharinen J. Taipale J. Keski-Oja J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The exact cleavage site(s) of serine proteinases in LTBPs has not been determined so far.To characterize the assembly of LTBP-2 to the matrix and its catabolism, recombinantly produced LTBP-2 was purified from the conditioned medium of an overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. It was found to be a calcium-binding glycoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 290 kDa. LTBP-2 was susceptible to release from the matrix by proteolysis, and the major proteolytic processing sites were identified by amino acid sequencing. The assembly of soluble LTBP-2 monomers with the sodium deoxycholate-insoluble fibers on the fibroblast extracellular matrix was observed, both with recombinant LTBP-2 from the conditioned medium of overexpressing CHO cells and with purified biotin-labeled LTBP-2.DISCUSSIONExtracellular matrix microfibrils have several structural components, including fibrillins, LTBPs, and microfibril-associated glycoproteins (10Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Yurchenko P.D. Birk D.E. Mecham R.P. Extracellular Matrix Assembly and Structure. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1994: 281-314Crossref Google Scholar). LTBPs have a dual role in the biology of ECM. They are components of microfibrils, and they also target latent forms of TGF-β growth factors to the ECM. In this work, we have purified recombinantly produced LTBP-2 and characterized its properties as an extracellular matrix protein. LTBP-2 was produced by LTBP-2 transfected CHO cell clone as a 290-kDa protein, as estimated by migration in SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. It was purified to homogeneity under nondenaturing conditions to characterize its biochemical properties and to study its proteolytic processing and assembly to the extracellular matrix. So far, only fibrillin-1 has been purified of integral microfibril components (35Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14763-14770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but, to our knowledge, this is the first time that a full-length LTBP/fibrillin family microfibril component has been successfully purified under nondenaturing conditions in a functionally active form.The purified LTBP-2 was found to bind calcium. Calcium binding stabilizes the structure of protein against proteolytic degradation, for example in fibrillin (36Reinhardt D.P. Ono R.N. Sakai L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1231-1236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Calcium binding may also stabilize protein-protein interactions (37Fehon R.G. Kooh P.J. Rebay I. Regan C.L. Xu T. Muskavitch M.A. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1990; 61: 523-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 38Rao Z. Handford P. Mayhew M. Knott V. Brownlee G.G. Stuart D. Cell. 1995; 82: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). LTBP-2 contains 20 EGF-like repeats, 16 of which contain the consensus sequence for calcium binding (4Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G. Davis E.C. Baker E. Sutherland G.R. Mecham R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6932-6942Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). It is thus apparent that these EGF-like repeats perform this function in LTBP-2 also.Of the integral microfibril proteins, at least fibrillin-1 has been shown to be a glycoprotein (40Glanville R.W. Qian R.Q. McClure D.W. Maslen C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26630-26634Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the domains that are glycosylated have not been identified. Chemical deglycosylation decreased the molecular mass of LTBP-2 by ∼20 kDa, as estimated by the migration in SDS-PAGE, indicating that LTBP-2 is glycosylated. Carbohydrates were detected in the central, proteolytically stable core fragment of LTBP-2, consisting mainly of EGF-like repeats (Fig.8). This domain has been suggested to form a rigid rod-like structure, and in this model, multiple monomers associating laterally would form the 10-nm microfibrils (41Downing A.K. Knott V. Werner J.M. Cardy C.M. Campbell I.D. Handford P.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 597-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The glycans in this region would probably point outward to give a hydrophilic character to the microfibril. Other glycosylated fragments were not detected, although potential N-glycosylation sites are present also in the N terminus of LTBP-2 (Fig. 8). This may be due to the absence of carbohydrates or to extensive degradation of N-terminal matrix binding domain by plasmin and elastase and subsequent migration out of the gel in SDS-PAGE.Microfibrils have been shown to be catabolized by, for example, neutrophil elastase (29Kielty C.M. Woolley D.E. Whittaker S.P. Shuttleworth C.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and LTBP-1 and LTBP-4 are processed by multiple serine proteases (6Saharinen J. Taipale J. Monni O. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18459-18469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 30Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The peptide bonds hydrolyzed by these enzymes could not be identified, because purified proteins have not been previously available in sufficient quantities. When proteolytic processing of LTBP-2 was studied by using recombinantly produced LTBP-2 and immunodetection, it was found to resemble that of LTBP-1. Purified LTBP-2 was processed directly with elastase and plasmin. By using purified material, we were able to exclude the possibility that these proteases would activate another protease present in cell-conditioned medium or in the ECM. LTBP-2 was processed with lower concentrations of plasmin and elastase initially to fragments of 160 kDa, whereas higher concentrations of both proteases yielded the major Ab-L22 immunoreactive fragments of ∼120 and ∼30 kDa. The N-terminal sequences of these protease-resistant fragments were determined by amino acid sequencing. The N terminus of the protease-resistant ∼120-kDa plasmin-generated fragment was located directly after the first 8-cysteine repeat and before the stretch of EGF-like repeats (Fig. 8), and the N terminus of ∼30-kDa fragment obtained with elastase was located before the hybrid domain (Fig. 8,sequence 3). It is likely that the first proteolytic cleavage that results to the release of LTBP-2 from the matrix and yields the 160-kDa fragment occurs before the hybrid domain (Fig. 8). Subsequent processing generates the major protease-resistant fragments of ∼120 and ∼30 kDa. The ∼30-kDa fragment thus probably comprises the hybrid domain, the third EGF-like domain, and the following 8-Cys repeat. In addition to these major processing sites, a cleavage site was found in an 15-kDa elastase-generated fragment of LTBP-2 (Fig. 8,sequence 2). This sequence localized between the hybrid and third EGF-like domain, and it probably represents a further cleavage of the ∼30-kDa fragment.The sequences between and around two most N-terminal EGF-like repeats in the LTBP-2 (see Fig. 8) are rich in proline and basic residues, and no fragments other than the ∼120- and ∼30-kDa fragments were detected. These facts suggest that the N-terminal part of LTBP-2 can be extensively degraded by proteases. The N-terminal EGF-like repeats are probably stable against proteolysis, but they are too small to be detected by SDS-PAGE using 4–15% gradient gels. Fragments released from the C terminus of LTBP-2 were not detected, although there is a proline-rich region before the last two EGF-like repeats (Fig. 8).The domains preceding the stretch of EGF-like repeats in the other LTBPs are similar in the sense that they contain also numerous prolines (Fig. 8), thus supporting the hypothesis of the presence of a proteolytically sensitive hinge domain between the ECM binding N-terminal domain and the TGF-β binding domain (20Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). These domains between LTBPs do not share any conserved sequence, but all hinge regions in the other LTBPs and in fibrillin-1 contain numerous proline residues, and also many positively charged residues, which may be targets for plasmin-like proteases. Accordingly, fibrillin-1 is cleaved by pepsin at the proline-rich region (42Maddox B.K. Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Glanville R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21381-21385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the corresponding region in fibrillin-2 is not proline-rich but contains instead multiple glycines (2Zhang H. Apfelroth S.D. Hu W. Davis E.C. Sanguineti C. Bonadio J. Mecham R.P. Ramirez F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 855-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), which may affect the sensitivity of different fibrillin containing microfibrils to proteolytic degradation.Like LTBP-1 (20Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), LTBP-2 was released from the extracellular matrix by proteolysis. A major protease released fragment had a molecular mass of 160 kDa as estimated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions. These results do not directly show the molecular mass of LTBP-2 present in the ECM. However, it is likely that only full-length LTBP-2 can assemble to the ECM, as is the case with LTBP-1 (20Taipale J. Miyazono K. Heldin C.H. Keski-Oja J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 30Taipale J. Lohi J. Saarinen J. Kovanen P.T. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4689-4696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), and that the cleavage of LTBP-2 is needed to release it from the extracellular matrix. LTBP-2 fragments of 160 kDa were generated also in solution, and the cleavage yielding the 160-kDa fragment occurred N-terminally to the hybrid domain. Thus, the only site(s) responsible for covalent ECM binding appear to be in the N-terminal part of LTBP-2, before the hybrid domain. Accordingly, the large splice variant of LTBP-1, which is extended by ∼350 amino acids in its N terminus, associates more efficiently with the ECM than the shorter form (43Olofsson A. Ichijo H. Moren A. ten Dijke P. Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31294-31297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This suggests that an additional ECM binding site is present in the N-terminal part of LTBP-1L. However, in the short splice variant of LTBP-1 the matrix binding site has been mapped to an area that is homologous to the region containing the third EGF-like repeat and the first 8-Cys domain in LTBP-2 (see Fig. 8) (44Nunes I. Gleizes P.E. Metz C.N. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1151-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Different LTBPs and their splice forms may thus have different mechanisms for ECM association. The amino acid sequences in this area are, however, quite similar between LTBPs 1 and 2 (not shown), and the discrepancy between the results is probably due to different experimental systems.At present, it is not clear whether cells are needed for microfibril assembly or microfibrils are capable of self assembly from monomers under suitable conditions. Human fetal lung fibroblasts were found to express LTBP-2 and assemble it to fibrillar structures in the ECM that resembled those observed using anti-LTBP-1 or anti-fibrillin antibodies (1Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R. Engvall E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2499-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar, 21Taipale J. Saharinen J. Hedman K. Keski-Oja J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 875-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The staining was significantly more intense in cells cultured in the presence of exogenous LTBP-2. The association of exogenous LTBP-2 with ECM was confirmed by using biotinylated LTBP-2. Purified LTBP-2 could be assembled to the ECM of human fibroblasts in a sodium deoxycholate-resistant form. These findings show that exogenous LTBP-2 is able to assemble to the ECM. However, endogenous production of LTBP-2 or some other LTBP may still be needed for the assembly, but these results suggest that the incorporation of LTBP-2 to the matrix and possibly the assembly of other microfibril components may involve soluble intermediates.

https://openalex.org/W2077634990,"The interaction between human DNA polymerase β (pol β) and DNA ligase I, which appear to be responsible for the gap filling and nick ligation steps in short patch or simple base excision repair, has been examined by affinity chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Domain mapping studies revealed that complex formation is mediated through the non-catalytic N-terminal domain of DNA ligase I and the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β that interacts with the DNA template and excises 5′-deoxyribose phosphate residue. Intact pol β, a 39-kDa bi-domain enzyme, undergoes indefinite self-association, forming oligomers of many sizes. The binding sites for self-association reside within the C-terminal 31-kDa domain. DNA ligase I undergoes self-association to form a homotrimer. At temperatures over 18 °C, three pol β monomers attached to the DNA ligase I trimer, forming a stable heterohexamer. In contrast, at lower temperatures (<18 °C), pol β and DNA ligase I formed a stable 1:1 binary complex only. In agreement with the domain mapping studies, the 8-kDa domain of pol β interacted with DNA ligase I, forming a stable 3:3 complex with DNA ligase I at all temperatures, whereas the 31-kDa domain of pol β did not. Our results indicate that the association between pol β and DNA ligase I involves both electrostatic binding and an entropy-driven process. Electrostatic binding dominates the interaction mediated by the 8-kDa domain of pol β, whereas the entropy-driven aspect of interprotein binding appears to be contributed by the 31-kDa domain. The interaction between human DNA polymerase β (pol β) and DNA ligase I, which appear to be responsible for the gap filling and nick ligation steps in short patch or simple base excision repair, has been examined by affinity chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Domain mapping studies revealed that complex formation is mediated through the non-catalytic N-terminal domain of DNA ligase I and the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β that interacts with the DNA template and excises 5′-deoxyribose phosphate residue. Intact pol β, a 39-kDa bi-domain enzyme, undergoes indefinite self-association, forming oligomers of many sizes. The binding sites for self-association reside within the C-terminal 31-kDa domain. DNA ligase I undergoes self-association to form a homotrimer. At temperatures over 18 °C, three pol β monomers attached to the DNA ligase I trimer, forming a stable heterohexamer. In contrast, at lower temperatures (<18 °C), pol β and DNA ligase I formed a stable 1:1 binary complex only. In agreement with the domain mapping studies, the 8-kDa domain of pol β interacted with DNA ligase I, forming a stable 3:3 complex with DNA ligase I at all temperatures, whereas the 31-kDa domain of pol β did not. Our results indicate that the association between pol β and DNA ligase I involves both electrostatic binding and an entropy-driven process. Electrostatic binding dominates the interaction mediated by the 8-kDa domain of pol β, whereas the entropy-driven aspect of interprotein binding appears to be contributed by the 31-kDa domain. The DNA repair pathway termed base excision repair (BER) 1The abbreviations used are: BERbase excision repairpol βDNA polymerase βdRP lyase2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyaseAPapurinic/apyridimicBSAbovine serum albuminGSTglutathione S-transferase. purifies genomic DNA of damaged nucleotides and abasic sites arising from a variety of exogenous and endogenous sources (1Seeberg E. Eide L. Bjøräs M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). For example, altered bases arising from deamination and from alkylation by both endogenous (e.g. S-adenosylmethionine) and exogenous alkylating agents (e.g. methyl methane sulfonate and vinyl chloride) are repaired by BER (2Wallace S.S. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 1988; 12: 431-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 3Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1296) Google Scholar, 4Samson L.D. Essays Biochem. 1992; 27: 69-78PubMed Google Scholar). The abasic site is generated from these base lesions by either spontaneous or enzymatic cleavage of theN-glycosidic bond. In both prokaryotic and mammalian cells, the abasic site is repaired by a mechanistically similar BER pathway (5Wilson S.H. Mut. Res. DNA Repair. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 6Parikh S.S. Clifford D.M. Tainer J.A. Structure. 1997; 5: 1543-1550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this pathway, the abasic site is usually cleaved by a class II AP endonuclease, followed by the sequential actions of a DNA polymerase, a 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (dRP lyase), and finally a DNA ligase (5Wilson S.H. Mut. Res. DNA Repair. 1998; 407: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Matsumoto Y. Kim L. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). BER can be distinguished from other DNA excision repair pathways by the relatively small repair patch produced in double-stranded DNA after incision at the abasic site and also by the fact that base lesions repaired by the BER pathway are generally limited to modifications that are less bulky than those lesions repaired by the nucleotide excision repair pathway. base excision repair DNA polymerase β 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase apurinic/apyridimic bovine serum albumin glutathione S-transferase. In mammalian cells, there are at least two BER pathways, which have been designated as follows: “short patch” or simple BER, in which the repair patch is a single nucleotide; and “long patch” or alternate BER, in which the repair patch is 2 to <13 nucleotides (5Wilson S.H.

In the case of short patch BER, several lines of research have recently confirmed a role for DNA polymerase β (pol β) (5Wilson S.H. Mut. Res.

The N-terminal 8-kDa domain of pol β functions as a dRP lyase catalyzing a β-elimination reaction releasing dRP from the preincised AP site in double-stranded DNA (7Matsumoto Y. Kim L.

This domain is also capable of functioning as an AP site lyase catalyzing strand cleavage at intact AP sites in double-stranded DNA (12Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15263-15270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Polymerase β and DNA ligase I have been found together in a BER-proficient complex isolated from bovine testis (13Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Since purified human pol β and DNA ligase I interact in vitro (13Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), it seems likely that these enzymes also bind to each other within the naturally occurring BER-proficient complex. In addition, an interaction between pol β and AP endonuclease, another component of the BER-proficient complex, has been observed (14Bennett R.A.O. Wilson D.M. Wong D. Demple B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7166-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In this study, the interaction between pol β and DNA ligase I has been further investigated by two independent, complementary approaches. Initially, the regions of these enzymes that are required for stable complex formation were mapped by affinity chromatography. Subsequently, equilibrium experiments were conducted in the analytical ultracentrifuge to characterize the molecular species formed as a result of the stable interactions between pol β and DNA ligase I. Thermodynamic studies were also conducted in the analytical ultracentrifuge to gain further insight into the mechanism of binding. In contrast to the studies with pol β and DNA ligase I, we could not detect a stable complex between pol β and AP endonuclease in similar experiments. Together, our results suggest intriguing new implications as to how pol β and DNA ligase I function together to complete the base excision repair pathway. Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad) with either recombinant human DNA ligase I or bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the ligand were prepared as described (15Levin D.S. Bai W. Yao N. O'Donnell M. Tomkinson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12863-12868Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The affinity beads (20 μl of beads with 0.15 nmol of either DNA ligase I or BSA as the ligand) were resuspended in 400 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20% glycerol) containing 2% dry milk and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. After the addition of 0.15 nmol of intact human pol β, the 8-kDa N-terminal domain, or the 31-kDa C-terminal domain (16Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Campbell J.L. Methods Enzymol, DNA Replication.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the incubation was continued for 1.5 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation, washed with binding buffer, and then resuspended in 15 μl of SDS-sample buffer. After heating at 70 °C for 5 min, proteins were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with the pol β antibody, antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Similar assays were carried out with different versions of the 8-kDa domain containing the single amino acid changes indicated in the figure legend. Human pol β cDNA was subcloned into pGSTag (18Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). After induction of plasmid-encoded GST and GST-pol β, cell lysates were prepared and protein expression was examined as described previously (19Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with equal amounts of either GST or GST-pol β were produced (19Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). DNA ligase I polypeptides were labeled in vitro by coupled transcription and translation and partially purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation (19Mackey Z.B. Ramos W. Levin D.S. Walter C.A. McCarrey J.R. Tomkinson A.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 989-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Labeled polypeptides (5 μl), which were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.7, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40), were incubated at room temperature for 30 min with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (20 μl with either GST-pol β or GST as the ligand) that had been diluted to a final volume of 150 μl with buffer A. After the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of buffer A, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Labeled proteins were detected in the dried gel by autoradiography. Recombinant wild-type human pol β and its 8-kDa and 31-kDa domains were produced and purified as described (16Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Campbell J.L. Methods Enzymol, DNA Replication. Academic Press, Orlando, FL.1995: 262, 98-107Google Scholar, 17Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AP endonuclease was purified as described previously (20Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Human DNA ligase I was purified from baculovirus-infected cells (21Wang Y.-C.J. Burkhart W.A. Mackey Z.B. Moyer M.C. Ramos W. Husain I. Chen J. Besterman J.M. Tomkinson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31923-31928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analytical ultracentrifugation was performed in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using either a 4-hole or 8-hole rotor at rotor speeds appropriate to the study. All experiments were begun at 2 or 3 °C and incremented by 3 or 4 °C (except as noted) following attainment of equilibrium until either 38 °C was reached or clear signs of protein degradation occurred. A total of six types of equilibrium runs were performed as described below. An 8-hole rotor was used at the speed of 15,000 rpm. The centrifuge cells were flushed with argon prior to loading to prevent oxidation of the AP endonuclease by the atmospheric oxygen in the unfilled portion of the channels. Two concentrations of each AP endonuclease and pol β having absorbencies ∼ 0.2 and 0.3 at 280 nm were run, the remaining three cells were loaded with mixtures of AP endonuclease and pol β in molar concentration ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 2:1. These mixtures had absorbencies ∼ 0.3 at 280 nm. Transmitted light intensity data were collected over a range of temperatures between 2 and 18 °C in steps of 4 °C. Again, the 8-hole rotor was employed but at 10,000 rpm. Two cells were loaded with two concentrations of pol β having absorbencies ∼ 0.22 and 0.34 at 280 nm; two other cells were loaded with DNA ligase I with concentrations having absorbencies ∼ 0.13 and 0.2 at 280 nm; and the remaining cells were loaded with pol β-DNA ligase I mixtures with molar concentration ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1, all having absorbencies ∼ 0.25. Transmitted light intensity data were again collected over a temperature range of 2–34 °C in steps of 4 °C. The data collected at 34 °C were discarded because protein degradation became apparent. A 4-hole rotor was employed at 27,000 rpm, and the three cells were loaded with concentrations having absorbencies of 0.15, 0.22, and 0.3, respectively, at 280 nm. Analysis of the data clearly showed that the protein did not self-associate. Intensity scans were taken only at 2, 10, 18, 25, and 32 °C, and used for the experimental estimation of the protein fragment partial specific volume. It is assumed that these estimated values are more accurate than the compositional values since they were determined experimentally in the centrifuge, with appropriate buffers over the appropriate temperature range. They were subsequently used in the analysis of the experimental data from the fourth experimental study. A 4-hole rotor was employed at 12,000 rpm, and the three cells were loaded with 1:1, 1:2, and 2:1 molar concentration ratios of DNA ligase I and the 8-kDa domain. The absorbencies at 280 nm in all three cells were between 0.2 and 0.3. Intensity scans were taken at temperatures from 2 to 38 °C in steps of 3 °C. This proved to be the most stable mixture as no protein degradation was observed below 38 °C. A 4-hole rotor was run at 17,000 rpm to equilibrium with three different protein concentrations having absorbencies ∼ 0.25, 0.35, and 0.45 at 280 nm, respectively. Intensity data were collected from 2 to 30 °C in steps of 4 °C. Three different protein concentration ratios were loaded and run to equilibrium at 10,000 rpm. The molar concentration ratios were 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 of 31-kDa domain to DNA ligase I with absorbencies ∼ 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4, respectively. Intensity data were collected from 2 to 38 °C in steps of 4 °C. The last two experiments were performed, after the data from the previous experiments had been analyzed, to check the consistency of the emerging description of the binding sites on the pol β molecule. Transmitted light intensity measurements were taken at a wavelength of 280 nm with a radial increment of 0.002 cm and with 16 replicates taken and averaged at each radial position. Equilibrium was considered to be attained when scans were invariant over 12 h. All protein solutions were in the same buffer: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. In a first experiment, the buffer also contained 20% glycerol; this was found to retard equilibrium to an unacceptable degree due to the viscosity of the buffer. Therefore, buffers without glycerol were used for all subsequent experiments. Solution columns were, in all cases, approximately 5 mm in height. Both absorbency and intensity data were analyzed using the Windows version of the MLAB software (Civilized Software, Inc., Bethesda, MD) on Pentium-based personal computers. The analysis was performed by assuming appropriate models for concentration distributions, starting with models consistent with current knowledge, and using non-linear least-squares curve fitting techniques to estimate model parameters such as equilibrium constants, molecular masses, and local species concentrations. The data presented in the figures are the results of fitting intensity data. The results of fitting absorbency data, which has been the customary approach in the past, did not change any of the qualitative conclusions reached. Transmitted light intensity data were collected in all cases, but both intensities and their corresponding derived absorbencies were used for the analysis. The reason for using both forms of the collected data lies in the recent demonstration that the customary analysis of absorbency data using least-squares estimation is not optimal due to the non-Gaussian character of the noise (22Dimitriadis E.K. Lewis M.S. Progr. Colloid Polymer Sci. 1997; 107: 20-26Crossref Google Scholar). The noise in the absorbency signal is the result of nonlinear transformation of the intensity signals, which are Gaussian. It has been shown that if intensity data were fitted directly, the estimation process would be optimal. A brief discussion of issues and mathematical methods are given in the Appendix, under “Direct Fitting of Transmitted Light Intensity in Analytical Ultracentrifugation.” Although simulated data clearly demonstrated the superiority of fitting intensity data, this is the first time where the methodology has been employed for actual collected data. For these reasons, both approaches were employed at every analysis step and the results compared. Where association was found to take place, the corresponding equilibrium constants were estimated by least-squares fitting of appropriate mathematical models to both absorbency and transmitted light intensity data. The mathematical models represented assumed modes of association whose validity was tested by the quality of the fit; changes of Gibbs standard free energies were calculated from the equilibrium constant values and the changes in standard entropy, enthalpy, and heat capacity of association were determined from the temperature dependence of the values of the changes in free energy. The mathematical models which best fit the collected data for each experiment, are given below. These models were used for the estimation of the relevant association parameters. The association model that emerged for the intact pol β data was that of an indefinite isodesmic self-association. The mathematical model for this type of association is given in Equation 1. cT,B(r)=cb,BexpABMBδr21−cb,BexplnK12−lnEB,280/2+ABMBδr2+εEquation 1 cT,B(r) is the total pol β monomer concentration at radius r, cb,Bis the monomer concentration at rb, an arbitrarily chosen reference radius, MB = 38185 Da is the monomer molecular mass, lnK12 represents the natural logarithm of the equilibrium constant, on a molar scale, for the binding of a monomer to any size oligomeric pol β chain,EB,280 = 22,080 is the molar extinction coefficient of pol β at 280 nm; AA = (1 − ν¯ρ)ω2/2RT, where ν¯ is the compositional partial specific volume of the solute molecule at the temperature T, ρ is the specific mass of the buffer at that temperature, ω is the rotational speed used in rad/s, R is the gas constant, and Tthe absolute temperature; also, δr 2 = r 2 − r b2 and ε is the base-line offset correction due to finite absorbency of the buffer and other measurement factors. lnK12,cb,B, and ε were used as the fitting parameters. The association model that emerged from the DNA ligase I (L) data was 3L ⇆ L3. Such a monomer-trimer system is mathematically modeled in Equation 2. cT,L(r)=cb,LexpALMLδr2+cb,LexplnK13−lnE+3ALMLδr2+εEquation 2 Here, lnE = ln( EE ,2802/3) is the conversion factor between molar and absorbency scale of lnK13, whereEL,280 = 64620 is the DNA ligase I molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm. The rest of the terms are self-explanatory or are defined in connection with Equation 1. In addition to the monomeric forms of these proteins, the DNA ligase I trimer and some form of a hetero-oligomer of the two proteins were observed. The large size difference between the monomers and the fact that very small amounts of monomers remained unbound made the problem mathematically ill-conditioned. This necessitated the use of mass conservation principles to mathematically eliminate one of the reference concentrations. The mathematical form for this type of system may be written as shown in Equation 3. cT(r)=cb,LexpALMLδr2+cb,Bcb,LexpABMBδr2+cb,L3explnKL3−lnEL,2802/3Equation 3 +3ALMLδr2+cb,Lncb,Bncb,LexplnKBLn−lnEBLn+nALML+ABMBδr2+εlnKL3 is, on molar scale, the natural logarithm of the association constant for the trimerization of the DNA ligase I itself which was discussed in the previous section, lnKBLn is the corresponding molar scale constant for the formation of the hetero-n-mer complex LnBn, cb,L is the reference concentration for the DNA ligase I and cb,B(cb,L) is the reference concentration for the 8-kDa domain of pol β as expressed in terms of that of the DNA ligase I based on mass conservation principles; lnEBLn = ln( EL ,280nEB ,280n/(n(EL,280 +EB,280))) is the conversion factor between molar and absorbency scales for lnKBLn, where EB,280 andEB,280 and the remaining symbols have been defined previously. The value of n determines the size of the hetero-oligomer formed and clearly,cb,B(cb,L) is also a function ofn and of lnKL3. Here,cb,L, lnKBLn, and ε were the fitting parameters. The system described under “DNA Ligase I with the 8-kDa Domain of pol β” above had to be modified slightly to allow for the indefinite self-association of the pol β as described under “Intact pol β.” Thus, the appropriate mathematical model is shown by Equation 4. cT(r)=cb,LexpALMLδr2+cb,L3explnKL3−lnEL,2802/3+3ALMLδr2Equation 4 +cb,BexpABMBδr21−cb,BexplnK12−lnEB,280/2+ABMBδr2+cb,Lncb,BnexplnKBLn−lnEBLn+nALML+ABMBδr2+εlnKL3 is the trimerization constant for the DNA ligase I, and lnKB,12 is the association constant for binding of a pol β monomer to its oligomeric chain, both of which are known as discussed in the previous sections; lnKBLn is the molar scale association constant for the formation of the heterocomplex BnLn. Single species analysis indicated the existence of species larger than the monomeric form. Reasonable data fits could be obtained assuming monomer-dimer or monomer-trimer self-associations but the best fits were obtained using the isodesmic model of Equation 1. Consistent with the results for intact pol β, the analysis was completed using Equation 1 as the mathematical model. The complete model given in Equation 4 was used for the analysis with n = 1 or n = 3, only to find out that the mathematical fits were consistently better whenKBLn approached zero indicating that no interprotein heterogeneous interactions were taking place. Therefore, the analysis was completed using Equation 4 with the heterogeneous term omitted. Analysis of the structure of pol β, initially by controlled proteolysis and more recently by x-ray crystallography, has shown that this enzyme is composed of an 8-kDa N-terminal domain that binds to DNA template and carries dRP lyase activity and a 31-kDa C-terminal domain that contains the DNA polymerase active site. In this study, using solution conditions similar to those previously employed for the isolation of macromolecular complexes containing pol β and DNA ligase I (13Prasad R. Singhal R.K. Srivastava D.K. Molina J.T. Tomkinson A.E. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16000-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we found that both intact pol β and the 8-kDa N-terminal domain bind to Affi-Gel 10 beads with DNA ligase I as the covalently attached ligand, but were not retained by beads with BSA as the ligand (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, no significant binding of the 31-kDa domain to either of the affinity beads was detected (Fig. 1 A). To further define the interaction between the 8-kDa domain and DNA ligase I, we examined binding of several altered versions of the 8-kDa domain to the DNA ligase I-affinity beads. The structures of these altered versions of the 8-kDa domain with single amino acid changes closely resemble that of the wild type protein, as judged by circular dichroism (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Changing a lysine residue at position 35, 60, 68, or 72 to alanine abolished the interaction between the 8-kDa domain and DNA ligase I. In addition, the substitution of glutamate with glutamine at position 71 and the substitution of lysine with alanine at position 84 also strongly reduced binding. An example of these experiments is shown in Fig. 1 B. With the E71Q and K84A residues of the 8-kDa domain, specific binding to the DNA ligase I-affinity beads was observed with higher protein concentrations of the 8-kDa domain (data not shown). These results suggest that the surface-exposed, charged residues known to be involved in the 8-kDa domain's interaction with DNA and the dRP lyase activity (23Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) are also involved in binding to DNA ligase I. DNA ligase I is composed of a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal domain that is dispensable for DNA ligase I catalytic activity, but is required for the enzyme's function in vivo (23Prasad R.

Knutson J.R. Porter D.K. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In experiments with in vitro translated DNA ligase I polypeptides, we observed specific binding of full-length DNA ligase I and a fragment corresponding to the N-terminal 118 amino acids of DNA ligase I to GST-pol β beads, but not to control GST beads (Fig.1 C). In contrast, a fragment corresponding to the C-terminal catalytic domain of DNA ligase I did not bind to the GST-pol β or GST beads (Fig. 1 C). Thus, we conclude that the 8-kDa domain of pol β mediates the interaction with DNA ligase I and that pol β binds to the N-terminal domain of DNA ligase I. To further characterize the stable complexes formed between pol β and DNA ligase I, we performed the series of equilibrium ultracentrifugation studies described below. It is well known that pol β can self-associate under conditions of lower ionic strength, but is a homogeneous monomer at higher ionic strength, such as buffer with 150 mm KCl (24Kim S.-J. Lewis M.S.

Under the conditions used here, single species analysis of the data revealed the existence of higher oligomers. To resolve the actual species formed, we fit a variety of models describing self-associations such as nB ⇆ Bn ornB ⇆ 2Bn ⇆ B2n forn = 2, 3, or 4 and where B is the protein monomer. For some of the models, the quality of the fit was reasonable and the fit tended to improve with the complexity of the model. It was observed, however, that with increasing temperature, models that included higher oligomers fit the data better. These observations led to the interpretation that intact pol β undergoes indefinite self-association whereby oligomers of all sizes are formed. In particular, if the free energy of association is constant for the addition of each additional monomer to the oligomeric chain, the association is termed isodesmic. The corresponding mathematical model (Equation 1) was fitted to the collected data. The fit was excellent at all temperatures with an association constant in the range 8,800 to 10,100 m−1.

We overexpressed wild-type, a GTPase defective (Q71L), and a guanine nucleotide binding defective (N125I) Rab6 protein inDrosophila photoreceptors to assess the in vivorole of Rab6 in the trafficking of rhodopsin and other proteins. Expression of Drab6Q71L greatly reduced the steady state levels of two rhodopsins, Rh1 and Rh3, whereasDrab6wt and Drab6N125I showed weaker effects. Analysis of a strain carrying Rh1 rhodopsin under a heat shock promoter showed thatDrab6Q71L, but notDrab6wt or Drab6N125I, prevents the maturation of rhodopsin beyond an immature 40 kDa form. Drab6Q71L is a GTPase defective mutant, indicating that anterograde transport of rhodopsin requires Rab6 GTPase function. The three Drab6 strains had no effect on the expression of several other photoreceptor proteins. TheDrab6Q71L photoreceptors show marked histological defects at young ages and degenerate over a two week time span. These results establish that rhodopsin is transported via a Rab6 regulated pathway and that defects in trafficking pathways lead to retinal degeneration.

These results establish that rhodopsin is transported via a Rab6 regulated pathway and that defects in trafficking pathways lead to retinal degeneration. Members of the Rab family of small GTPases are localized in distinct subcellular compartments (1Novick P. Brennwald P. Cell. 1993; 75: 597-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and within these compartments they regulate vesicular trafficking by cycling between GTP- and GDP-bound forms (2Zerial M. Stenmark H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A general model of Rab function has emerged in which a complex of Rab-GDP and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) 1The abbreviations used are: GDIguanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitorRT-PCRreverse transcription-polymerase chain reactionERGelectroretinographyPDAprolonged depolarizing afterpotentialERendoplasmic reticulum. is maintained in the cytosol. On binding of this complex to the donor membrane, GDI is displaced and GDP is exchanged for GTP. Rab-GTP is recruited onto the transport vesicle, which buds from the donor membrane and then associates with the target membrane. The Rab-GTP is thought to mediate fusion of the vesicle through interactions with effector molecules on the target membrane. It is not known whether GTP hydrolysis of the Rab-GTP is required for vesicle fusion or occurs after fusion. After GTP hydrolysis, Rab-GDP is retrieved from the target membrane by GDI and recycled to the donor membrane (3Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

The study of point mutations in several rab genes affecting amino acids essential for guanine nucleotide interactions has documented the importance of the Rab-guanine nucleotide interactions in Rab function (6Tisdale E.J.

S. A. 1997; 94: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Rab6 protein is likely involved in intra-Golgi transport. A GTPase defective Rab6 greatly reduced transport of the proteins between cis/medial and late Golgi compartments in mammalian cell culture (9Martinez O. Schimdt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). More recently, Martinez et al. (8Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G. Salamero J. Goud B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) found that overexpression of wild-type Rab6 and a GTPase-defective Rab6 redistributed a trans-Golgi protein to the ER membrane compartment. Biochemical studies using specialized cells, however, have suggested a role for Rab6 in post-Golgi transport. Rab6 is associated with post-Golgi vesicles in Torpedo marmorata electrocytes (10Jasmin B. Goud B. Camus G. Cartaud J. Neuroscience. 1992; 49: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), hypothalamic neuronal cells (11Tixier-Vidal A. Barret A. Picart R. Mayau V. Vogt D. Wiedenmann B. Goud B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 935-947PubMed Google Scholar), and frog retinal cells (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 803-813PubMed Google Scholar). The studies with frog retinal cells suggested that the Rab6 protein is associated with rhodopsin-containing vesicles that exit from thetrans-Golgi on their way to the rod outer segment. The Drosophila photoreceptor provides an excellent experimental system to study Rab6 function in rhodopsin membrane trafficking, given the availability of mutations in rhodopsin and other genes that impede rhodopsin maturation. Many of these mutations result in age-dependent degeneration of photoreceptors, suggesting that correct rhodopsin trafficking is critical to maintenance of photoreceptor stability. Some human retinal diseases caused by rhodopsin mutations, may also be due to improper rhodopsin trafficking within the photoreceptor (13Sung C.-H. Makino C. Baylor D.A. Nathans J. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5818-5833Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, an inherited form of choroideremia results from a defective Rab escort protein-1, establishing that defects in Rab protein function are involved in other human degenerative diseases (14Seabra M.C. Ho Y.K. Anant J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24420-24427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We established an in vivo system to study the role of Rab6 in the trafficking of rhodopsin and other photoreceptor proteins. Our results suggest that Rab6 is required for anterograde rhodopsin transport through the ER-Golgi complex. Further, defects in Rab6 trafficking also trigger retinal degeneration, strengthening the tie between defects in the rhodopsin maturation pathway and photoreceptor degeneration. Degenerate primers based on the conserved DTAGQ and NKXD sequence motifs found in all Rab proteins were used to RT-PCR amplify rab sequences from totalDrosophila RNA. RNA was isolated following methods of Cathala et al. (15Cathala G. Sacouret B. Mendez B. West M. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). RT-PCR reaction was performed as specified by the RT-PCR reaction kit manufacturer (Perkin-Elmer). The 170-base pair fragments recovered from these reactions were cloned and sequenced to identify the Drosophila rab6 sequence (Drab6). The 170-base pair fragment of Drab6 was then used to isolate the entire rab6 gene from aDrosophila genomic library. In situhybridizations, carried out as described by Ashburner (16Ashburner M. Drosophila: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), placed the gene at 33C/D on the standard Drosophila salivary chromosome map. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to createDrab6N125I (AAC to ATC) andDrab6Q71L (CAG to CTG). The coding sequence of the two mutants and Drab6wt were placed under the control of the ninaE promoter and inserted in a P-element transformation vector (17Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 6341-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Drosophila transgenic flies were made by standard means (18Spradling A.C. Roberts D.B. Drosophila: A Practical Approach. IRL Press Limited, Oxford, England1986: 175-196Google Scholar) using the null mutantninaE oI17 as the recipient strain. Four independent lines were obtained for Drab6wt andDrab6N125I and two independent lines were obtained for Drab6Q71L. All lines for each construct showed similar levels of Rab6 expression and rhodopsin defects as described in this paper. A polyclonal antibody toDrosophila Rab6 was generated using the GEX glutathioneS-transferase system (19Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). To generate the antibody, a 243-base pair region coding for a C-terminal region of Rab6 (amino acids 129–208) was placed in the pGEX-3 vector. The fusion protein was collected on glutathione-agarose beads and then recovered from the beads by eluting in 8 m urea, 1 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1m Tris, pH 8.0. The fusion protein was dialyzed overnight in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and used to immunize mice. Proteins from fly heads were extracted in 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 14.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) on 4–15%, 10%, or 12% gels, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 19 mm Tris, 150 mm glycine, 20% methanol. Proteins were detected using the polyclonal antibodies directed against Rh1 or Rh3 opsin, 2T. Washburn, M. Serikaku, and J. O'Tousa, unpublished data. RdgB (21Vihtelic T.S. Goebl M. Milligan S. O'Tousa J.E. Hyde D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), Trp (22Montell C. Rubin G.M. Neuron. 1989; 2: 1313-1323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar), and NinaC (23Montell C. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 757-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Protein was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To analyze the transient expression of rhodopsin, we used a stock designated hs-ninaE-hsv tag 14. This stock contained an HSV (epitope identified in herpes simplex virus glycoprotein D)-tagged rhodopsin under the heat shock promoter (24Kurada P. Tonini T.D. Serikaku M.A. Piccini J.P. O'Tousa J.E. Visual Neurosci. 1998; 15: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Flies heterozygous for the tagged rhodopsin and the respective Drab6 P-transgene were heat shocked for 1 h at 37 °C and placed at room temperature (22 °C) for the indicated time. Protein separation, transfer, and detection were performed as stated above, using a monoclonal antibody directed against the HSV tag (Novagen Corp.). Electroretinography (ERG) recordings (as described in Larrivee et al. (25Larrivee D.C. Conrad S.K. Stephenson R.S. Pak W.L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 78: 521-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar)) were performed on 2-day-old white eyed flies reared in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Electron microscopy was performed as described by Washburn and O'Tousa (26Washburn T. O'Tousa J.E. Genetics. 1992; 130: 585-595Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All genotypes were white eyed and maintained in a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The control, Drab6wt andDrab6N125I flies were homozygous forninaE +, whereas theDrab6Q71L flies were heterozygous forninaE +. 16 days oldDrab6wt flies heterozygous for rhodopsin were also sectioned and provided the same results (data not shown). We used a PCR-based approach to initiate a study of Drosophila rab6 and identified the rab6 gene previously named Drab6by Satoh et al. (27Satoh A. Tokunaga F. Ozaki K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We created two Drab6mutations, the GTPase defective (Drab6Q71L) and the guanine nucleotide binding defective (Drab6N125I), by in vitromutagenesis. These two mutants and the wild-type (Drab6wt) coding sequences were placed under the control of the ninaE promoter to allow specific and high levels of expression only in the Drosophila R1−R6 class of photoreceptor cells (28Mismer D. Rubin G.M. Genetics. 1987; 116: 565-578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein blotting experiments usingDrosophila Rab6 antibody confirmed that transgenic flies carrying these genes made large amounts of the Rab6 proteins (Fig.1). The majority of the Rab6 protein in the transgenic flies possessed a higher apparent molecular mass than that seen in control wild-type flies, corresponding to a nonprenylated Rab6 protein (9Martinez O. Schimdt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The lipid modified form of Rab6 was also easily observed in these transgenic flies. We estimate that 32 times more lipid-modified Rab6 protein was detected in flies expressing theDrab6wt constructs than in wild-type control flies. Similar high levels of modified Rab6 protein (37 times more protein in Drab6N125I, and 57 times more protein in Drab6Q71L) was observed in the other transgenic flies. To look for generalized defects in photoreceptor function because of expression of these Rab6 proteins, we assayed the light response by ERG (Fig. 2). All strains show a robust response to light stimuli. A prolonged depolarizing afterpotential (PDA) is seen in the ERG, on exposure to blue light, when a substantial amount of rhodopsin is converted to an active metarhodopsin form (29Pak W.L. Breakfield X.O. Neurogenetics: Genetic Approaches to the Nervous System. Elsevier-North Holland, New York1979: 67-99Google Scholar). Control flies generate a complete PDA, andDrab6wt and Drab6N125I flies show a slight defect in the PDA maintenance. Drab6Q71L flies completely lack a PDA. Given the importance of high rhodopsin levels in generating a PDA, these results suggested that Drab6wt andDrab6N125I have minor effects on rhodopsin expression, and Drab6Q71L flies possess much lower levels of rhodopsin. Rhodopsin protein levels were examined by Western blot analysis to assess the effects of the Drab6strains (Fig. 3). Rhodopsin levels are dramatically reduced in Drab6Q71L (12% of wild type). There is a more modest reduction in theDrab6wt and Drab6N125I flies (76 and 74% of wild-type levels, respectively).Figure 3Rhodopsin levels in wild-type,Drab6 wt , Drab6 N125I , and Drab6 Q71L flies. Shown is the immunoblot analysis of rhodopsin levels from head protein extracts of five flies tested. All flies were 2–3 days post-eclosion and heterozygous for a wild-type rhodopsin gene. Rhodopsin was detected by a polyclonal rhodopsin antibody. The estimation of protein levels are averages derived from densitometric analysis of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We analyzed the effects of the Drab6 strains in an experimental protocol designed to document defects in the rhodopsin maturation pathway (24Kurada P. Tonini T.D. Serikaku M.A. Piccini J.P. O'Tousa J.E. Visual Neurosci. 1998; 15: 693-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 30Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) (see also “Experimental Procedures”). In these experiments, flies carried a rhodopsin gene tagged by an HSV epitope expressed from a heat shock promoter. Expression of this rhodopsin gene occurs only during a 37 °C heat shock, allowing the fate of rhodopsin synthesized during a restricted time window to be assessed. For the study here, we constructed strains carrying both the heat shock-controlled rhodopsin gene and each of the three Drab6 genes. A strain containing the heat shock-controlled rhodopsin gene but noDrab6 construct served as the control in these experiments. In the absence of heat shock, no HSV-tagged rhodopsin could be detected in protein blotting experiments (Fig.4 A). Two h following the heat shock, the rhodopsin is detected as a 40-kDa species (open arrow) as well as several slightly higher molecular mass forms. 14.5 h after the pulse, rhodopsin is still present in the 40-kDa form but now is also detected in lower molecular mass bands (35–38 kDa). At 24 h after the heat shock, most of the rhodopsin is found in the 35-kDa form (filled arrow). This 35-kDa form has the same mobility as the major species of rhodopsin found in flies expressing the HSV-tagged rhodopsin from the ninaE promoter, hence we consider it the mature form. The strains containing theDrab6wt and Drab6N125I genes had the same profile as the control strain (Fig. 4, Cand D). The Drab6Q71L flies, however, showed defects in rhodopsin maturation (Fig. 4 B). Two h after heat shock, the majority of the rhodopsin was detected in the 40-kDa form, as expected from the analysis of the other strains. However, at 14.5, 24, and 48 h after heat shock, the 40-kDa rhodopsin remained as the predominant species. The data establish that the Drab6Q71L mutant is defective in processing the immature 40-kDa rhodopsin species into the mature 35-kDa form. In Drosophila six different opsins are expressed in subsets of the photoreceptor cells. To test the effects of the Drab6 constructs on a different rhodopsin, we misexpressed the Rh3 rhodopsin in R1−R6 photoreceptor cells (31Feiler R. Bjornson R. Kirshfeld K. Mismer D. Rubin G.M. Smith D.P. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3862-3868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of these strains (Fig.5 A) showed that Rh3 protein levels were reduced in all three Drab6 transgenic strains compared with controls. As with expression of the Rh1 (NinaE) protein, Rh3 levels were most reduced in the Drab6Q71L flies, with the other two lines showing a significant, but smaller, reduction of protein. We examined the protein levels of two other photoreceptor membrane proteins involved in phototransduction to determine whether theDrab6Q71L effect was specific to rhodopsin. RdgB is a membrane protein that is localized to the photoreceptor sub rhabdomeric-cisternae (21Vihtelic T.S. Goebl M. Milligan S. O'Tousa J.E. Hyde D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and Trp is a Ca2+ channel protein that co-localizes with rhodopsin in the rhabdomeres (32Niemeyer B.A. Suzuki E. Scott K. Jalink K. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 651-659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Neither RdgB (Fig. 5 B) nor Trp (Fig. 5 C) protein levels were dramatically affected in any Drab6 strain. Similarly, the protein levels of the membrane-associatedninaC-encoded cytoskeletal photoreceptor proteins (Fig.5 D) were not affected. Electron microscopy was carried out to assess the changes in photoreceptor ultrastructure caused by overexpression of theDrab6 genes. Photoreceptors R1−R6 express theninaE-encoded Rh1 rhodopsin and, therefore, also express theDrab6 genes constructed in this study. The R7 cell, shown in Fig. 6, A-C, will not express the Drab6 transgenes and therefore serves as a convenient control in all micrographs. Three-day old control photoreceptors are shown in Fig. 6 A. Drab6wt andDrab6N125I R1−R6 photoreceptors (data not shown) are similar in structure to the control. Drab6Q71L flies (Fig. 6 B), however, show a marked reduction in the R1−R6 rhabdomeres volume. The area of the R1−R6 rhabdomeres in the Drab6Q71L rhabdomeres is similar in size to the R7 rhabdomere, even though the wild-type R1−R6 rhabdomeres are 70% larger (33Leonard D.S. Bowman V.D. Ready D.F. Pak W.L. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 605-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Drab6Q71L R1−R6 cells possess an abnormal accumulation of membranes at the base of the rhabdomeres (arrow in Fig. 6 D). Some R1−R6 photoreceptors show loosely organized rhabdomeric membranes (arrow in Fig.6 E). Another striking feature is the frequent appearance of “whorl” membranes (34Blest A.D. Williams T.P. Baker B.W. The Effects of Constant Light on Visual Processes. Plenum Press, New York, NY1980: 217-245Crossref Google Scholar) within the cell (arrow in Fig.6 F). Histological analysis on older flies indicated that overexpression of all three Drab6 genes triggered retinal degeneration. A cross section of an ommatidial unit of a 16-day oldDrab6Q71L is shown in Fig. 6 C (data not shown for Drab6wt andDrab6N125I). Some R1−R6 photoreceptors of all the strains lacked rhabdomeric membranes (cell bodies marked witharrowheads in Fig. 6 C). A major objective of this study was to investigate the role of Rab6 in rhodopsin maturation. Protein blotting experiments and ERG analysis established thatDrab6Q71L flies possessed about 12% of the wild-type steady state levels of rhodopsin. Drab6wt and Drab6N125I flies possess about 75% of the wild-type rhodopsin levels. The only deficit in the ERG traces can be attributed to the reduction in rhodopsin content, indicating that overexpression of the Rab6 proteins did not have a debilitating effect on the physiology of these photoreceptor cells. Analysis of rhodopsin transport using a heat shock-regulated promoter demonstrated that in wild-type, Drab6wt, andDrab6N125I photoreceptors, rhodopsin matures to its final 35-kDa form within 24 h. In contrast, rhodopsin maturation is severely impaired in Drab6Q71L, showing little progression beyond the 40-kDa intermediate form. Previous work established that the 40-kDa rhodopsin is a high mannose intermediate found within the ER. The 40-kDa rhodopsin requires theninaA encoded cyclophilin (35Colley N.J. Baker E.K. Stamnes M.A. Zuker C.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 255-263Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and retinal addition (36Ozaki K. Nagatani H. Ozaki M. Tokunaga F. Neuron. 1993; 10: 1113-1119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 37Huber A. Wolfrum U. Paulsen R. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 63: 219-229PubMed Google Scholar) to exit the ER. Our results show that Rab6Q71L blocks rhodopsin transport prior to its progression into the cis or medial Golgi compartment that contains the mannosidase which acts on the high mannose rhodopsin intermediate (38Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 39Rothman J.E. Orci L. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 1460-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with a role of Rab6 in intra-Golgi transport. Although we have no data suggesting Rab6 in post-Golgi events as suggested by a study on frog retinal cells (12Deretic D. Papermaster D.S. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 803-813PubMed Google Scholar), our analysis does not rule out a second independent role of Rab6. A recent study showed that transient expression of Rab1N124I protein prevents rhodopsin maturation beyond the 40-kDa intermediate (40Satoh A.K. Tokunaga F. Kawamura S. Ozaki K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2943-2953PubMed Google Scholar), similar to the phenotype observed in theDrab6Q71L mutant. It is striking that dominant mutants of the first two Rab proteins studied in theDrosophila photoreceptor appear to affect similar stages of rhodopsin maturation. However, rhodopsin likely remains in a 40-kDa form as it trafficks from the ER to the cis or medial Golgi where modifications of the oligosaccharide side chain is thought to occur. Therefore, multiple Rabs, including the Rab1 and Rab6 proteins, may be required in these steps. The expression of Rh3 rhodopsin was also markedly reduced in the Drab6Q71L flies, and smaller effects were seen in the two other Drab6 strains. On the other hand, none of the Drab6 strains affected the levels of other photoreceptor proteins tested. These results suggest that rhodopsin transport is more sensitive to defects in the Rab6-regulated pathway, with alternative maturation pathways available for other photoreceptor membrane proteins. An alternative explanation, that RdgB and Trp are transported via the Rab6 pathway but nonetheless are maintained at normal levels, is only plausible if the stability of these proteins is dramatically increased inDrab6Q71L mutant photoreceptors. Resolution of these issues will likely require the identification and analysis of anin vivo loss of function rab6 mutant. By analogy with point mutations of rab6 (9Martinez O. Schimdt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) and other rab genes (6Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar,41Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Steele-Mortimer O. Lutcke A. Gruenberg J. Zerial M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1287-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), the Gln to Leu change prevents GTP hydrolysis. Therefore the Rab6Q71L mutant protein will always be bound to GTP. Drab6Q71L is a potent inhibitor of rhodopsin protein transport, which is consistent with the behavior of this mutation in other Rab6 studies (8Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). If GTP hydrolysis is required for vesicle fusion, as proposed for Rab3a (42Johannes L. Lledo P.-M. Roa M. Vincent J.-D. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar),Drab6Q71L is expected to prevent the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. Our results showing that theDrab6Q71L form inhibits rhodopsin transport is consistent with a role for GTP hydrolysis to promote anterograde transport of rhodopsin-bearing vesicles. Alternatively, Rab6 in its GTP form could be a positive regulator of the retrograde transport, as proposed by Martinez et al. (8Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G. Salamero J. Goud B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 9Martinez O. Schimdt A. Salamero J. Hoflack B. Roa M. Goud B. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1575-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). According to this notion, Drab6Q71L could increase the flow of retrograde transport and indirectly disrupt the anterograde pathway, resulting in inhibition of protein transport. However, this model was originally proposed to rationalize results showing that Rab6wt has similar effects as Rab6Q72L that were not confirmed in our experiments. We also documented an inhibition of Rh1 and Rh3 rhodopsin expression in the Drab6wt andDrab6N125I strains. However, the heat shock analysis indicates that Drab6wt andDrab6N125I have little or no inhibitory effects on the maturation of the 40- to the 35-kDa form of Rh1 rhodopsin. Thus, the mechanism of Drab6wt andDrab6N125I action is distinct from that ofDrab6Q71L. The Drab6wt and Drab6N125I proteins might have an effect on later stages of rhodopsin maturation, but it is also possible that the reduction in rhodopsin is a consequence of secondary effects associated with the overexpression of these proteins. All Rab proteins require isoprenylation to be functional (43Magee T. Newman C. Trends Cell Biol. 1992; 2: 318-323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). When we overexpress Rab6 in photoreceptors, 25–35% of the protein is isoprenylated. The failure to completely modify the large amount of Rab6 found in these flies suggests that overexpression has overwhelmed the Rab geranylgeranyl transferase pathway responsible for the prenylation of all Rab proteins (46Porter J.A. Hicks J.L. Williams D.S. Montell C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Therefore, overexpression of Rab6 may also inhibit the modification, and therefore the activity, of other Rab proteins. Thus, the defects seen in photoreceptors overexpressing Rab6wt or Rab6N125I may not be directly attributable to the altered Rab6 activity. It is surprising that Drab6wt andDrab6N125I have similar effects. The Asn to Ile mutation is thought to create a defect in guanine nucleotide binding. In mammalian cell culture, the Asn to Ile mutant of Rab2 and Rab3a proteins show similar inhibitory effect on secretion as observed for the Gln to Leu mutations (6Tisdale E.J. Bourne J.R. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 42Johannes L. Lledo P.-M. Roa M. Vincent J.-D. Henry J.-P. Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Asn to Ile mutation in rab6 increased secretion rate (7McConlogue L. Castellano F. deWit C. Schenk D. Maltese W.A. J. Biol Chem. 1996; 271: 1343-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The lack of a mutant phenotype in our studies does not result from Rab6N125I protein instability since protein immunoblots show high levels of this protein. It appears that the Rab6N125I protein, perhaps because of lack of nucleotide binding, is unable to participate in the rab6 cycle. Overexpression of any form of Rab6 caused retinal degeneration, but the rate and severity of degeneration depended upon the form of Rab6. At young ages,Drab6Q71L photoreceptors already show structural differences that distinguish it from Drab6wt andDrab6N125I photoreceptors. The most striking difference is a much smaller volume occupied by the R1−R6 rhabdomeres. This phenotype is shared with mutant ninaE (33Leonard D.S. Bowman V.D. Ready D.F. Pak W.L. J. Neurobiol. 1992; 23: 605-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 44O'Tousa J.E. Leonard D.S. Pak W.L. J.

Eye Res. 1991; 53: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All these flies possess reduced rhodopsin content, suggesting that the reduced size of the rhabdomere in theDrab6Q71L mutant is likely the result of poor rhodopsin maturation. The Drab6Q71L photoreceptors exhibit other ultrastructural defects, most notably an accumulation of disorganized membranes within the cytoplasm as well as “whorl” membranes thought to represent membrane recycling processes (34Blest A.D. Williams T.P. Baker B.W. The Effects of Constant Light on Visual Processes. Plenum Press, New York, NY1980: 217-245Crossref Google Scholar). Satoh et al. (40Satoh A.K. Tokunaga F. Kawamura S. Ozaki K. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2943-2953PubMed Google Scholar) documented a similar phenotype in the Drosophila rab1N124I mutant. Consistent results are also obtained in mammalian cell culture. Martinez et al. (8Martinez O. Antony C. Pehau-Arnaudet G. Berger E.G. Salamero J. Goud B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1828-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) documented that overexpression of the rab6Q72L mutant allows the mixing of ER and Golgi membrane compartments, and morphological changes of the ER/Golgi are noted in other studies using lovastatin to limit prenylation of Rab proteins (48Ivessa N.E. Gravotta D. De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Kreibich G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20828-20834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the abnormal membrane accumulation documented inDrab6Q71L photoreceptors may result from abnormal Golgi organization, and the defects in rhodopsin maturation may be a secondary consequence of this defect. On the other hand, our data are not compatible with a catastrophic defect in ER-Golgi transport in Drab6Q71L photoreceptors, as these photoreceptors retain normal physiological function, and other membrane proteins are detected at normal levels. Dominant rhodopsin mutants cause age-dependent retinal degeneration as a result of defects in rhodopsin transport (30Colley N.J. Cassill J.A. Baker E.K. Zuker C.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3070-3074Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 49Kurada P. O'Tousa J.E. Neuron. 1995; 14: 571-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We initiated this study to examine the role of Rab6 in rhodopsin transport and to explore an in vivo experimental system to study the trafficking of rhodopsin. Our results establish the importance of Rab6-regulated trafficking mechanisms in both rhodopsin biogenesis and maintenance of photoreceptor morphology and function.

https://openalex.org/W2037668423,"We coexpressed myosin Iβ heavy chain with three different calmodulin mutants in which the two Ca2+-binding sites of the two N-terminal domain (E12Q), C-terminal domain (E34Q), or all four sites (E1234Q) are mutated in order to define the importance of these Ca2+binding sites to the regulation of myosin Iβ. The calmodulin mutated at the two Ca2+ binding sites in N-terminal domain and C-terminal domain lost its lower affinity Ca2+ binding site and higher affinity Ca2+ binding site, respectively. We found that, based upon the change in the actin-activated ATPase activities and actin translocating activities, myosin Iβ with E12Q calmodulin has the regulatory characteristics similar to myosin Iβ containing wild-type calmodulin, while myosin Iβ with E34Q or E1234Q calmodulin lose all Ca2+ regulation. While the increase in myosin Iβ ATPase activity paralleled the dissociation of 1 mol of calmodulin from myosin Iβ heavy chain for both wild type (abovepCa 5) and E12Q calmodulin (above pCa 6), the Ca2+ level required for the inhibition of actin-translocating activity of myosin Iβ was lower than that required for dissociation of calmodulin, suggesting that the conformational change induced by the binding of Ca2+ at the high affinity site but not the dissociation of calmodulin is critical for the inhibition of the motor activity. Our results suggest that the regulation of unconventional myosins by Ca2+ is directly mediated by the Ca2+ binding to calmodulin, and that the C-terminal pair of Ca2+-binding sites are critical for this regulation.

Myosins are a large family of molecular motors responsible for diverse forms of cell contractility and motility, such as muscle contraction, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis (1Mooseker M. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Myosin I, one of the 14 classes of this myosin superfamily, is single-headed and unable to form filaments (1Mooseker M. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 2Pollard D.P. Doberstein S.K. Zot H.G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 653-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Cope M.J. Whisstock J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16431-16434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Based on the similarity of their primary structures in the head domain, myosin Is are further classified into four subclasses. Myosin Iβ is one of these subclasses (1Mooseker M. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 4Hasson T. Moosker M.S. J. Biol.

Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Subsequently, cDNAs encoding myosin Iβ were isolated from bovine adrenal gland (6Zhu T. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), bovine brain (7Reizes O. Barylko B. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1393-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Myosin Iβ was found in a variety of tissues with the highest expression levels in heart, lung, adrenal gland, esophagus, and stomach (6Zhu T. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 7Reizes O. Barylko B. Li C. Sudhof T.C. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Joyce M.P. Greene L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1405-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Myosin Iβ localizes to actin-rich peripheral structures, such as filopodia and lamellipodia of culture cells (9Wagner M.C. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and it is thought to play a role in cytoskeleton rearrangement. Interestingly, myosin Iβ is also found in hair bundles purified from the bullfrog sacculus, suggesting that myosin Iβ may function as an adaptation motor which regulates the tip link-associated cation selective channels (11Gillespie P.G. Wagner M.C. Hudspeth A.J. Neuron. 1993; 11: 581-594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar,12Assad J.A. Corey D.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 3291-3309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Studies from both naturally isolated and recombinant myosins Iβ have shown that calmodulin is associated with myosin Iβ heavy chain (5Barylko B. Wagner M.C. Reizes O. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast to most calmodulin-dependent enzymes, the association of calmodulin with myosin I does not require Ca2+ binding to calmodulin. Thus, calmodulin functions as a light chain subunit. Myosin Iβ, like all the other vertebrate unconventional myosins, has several repeats of a 24–30-amino acid sequence called the IQ motif at the neck region between the myosin head motor domain and the tail domain. This motif has been suggested to provide the binding site for EF-hand family proteins such as calmodulin (1Mooseker M. Cheney R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 633-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 14Wolenski J.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 310-316Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All vertebrate unconventional myosins that have been characterized so far contain calmodulin as light chains. For some unconventional myosins, other small proteins besides calmodulin have also been found to function as light chains (15Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A common property of calmodulin targets that contain IQ motif, such as the unconventional myosins and neuromodulin, is that they have a higher affinity for the Ca2+-free form of calmodulin (16Chapman E.R. Au D. Alexander K.A. Nicolson T.A. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 207-213Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Calmodulin is one of the major intracellular Ca2+-sensor proteins, containing four EF-hand type Ca2+-binding loops. The N-terminal pair are linked to the C-terminal pair by a central flexible linker. Among the four Ca2+-binding sites, the C-terminal pair of Ca2+-binding sites have a higher Ca2+-binding affinity than those of the N terminus (17Maune J.F Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Linse S. Helmersson A. Forsen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8050-8059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding induces structural changes in calmodulin, and it is believed that these Ca2+-induced conformational changes allow calmodulin to activate target enzymes when the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is elevated (reviewed in Ref. 19Ikura M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 14-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis studies have shown that a conserved glutamic acid residue at the 12th position of each Ca2+-binding loop is critical for Ca2+ binding, and substitution of this conserved glutamic acid with glutamine in each Ca2+-binding site abolishes its Ca2+ binding ability (17Maune J.F Klee C.B. Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5286-5295Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both the enzymatic and mechanical activities of vertebrate myosin I have been shown to be regulated by Ca2+ (5Barylko B. Wagner M.C. Reizes O. Albanesi J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 490-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 2279-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and this is also true for other unconventional myosins, such as myosin V (15Cheney R.E. O'Shea M.K. Heuser J.E. Coelho M.V. Wolenski J.S. Espreafico E.M. Forscher P. Larson R.E. Mooseker M.S. Cell. 1993; 75: 13-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A member of another myosin I subclass, intestinal brush-border myosin I (BBMI), 1The abbreviations used are: BBMIbrush-border myosin IMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid9-AC9-anthroylcholine.1The abbreviations used are: BBMIbrush-border myosin IMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid9-AC9-anthroylcholine. has been extensively characterized in terms of Ca2+ effects. It was found that BBMI moved actin filaments although the velocity was quite low (∼0.05 μm/s), and the activity was abolished at Ca2+ concentrations above 5 μm. On the other hand, actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of BBMI increased with increasing Ca2+ concentrations (24Wolenski J.S. Hayden S.M. Forscher P. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 613-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, partial dissociation of calmodulin from BBMI was observed at a Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm. Similarly, Zhu et al. (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) have shown that one of the three calmodulin molecules bound to recombinant myosin Iβ dissociated from the heavy chain at a Ca2+ concentration of 10 μm. While Mg2+-ATPase activity increased above pCa 6, actin sliding velocity of myosin Iβ was abolished at pCa 6 (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Ca2+ binding to the calmodulin light chains is critical for the regulation of vertebrate myosin I motor function. However, it is unclear whether the dissociation of calmodulin is necessary to stop myosin I motor activity since the Ca2+ concentration required for the dissociation of one calmodulin from myosin Iβ heavy chain seems to be higher than the Ca2+ concentration for inhibition of the actin translocating activity (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have examined the mechanism by which Ca2+ and calmodulin regulate myosin Iβ motor function by coexpressing various calmodulin mutants defective in Ca2+binding with myosin Iβ heavy chain and analyzing the actin-activated ATPase activity and motor function of the expressed myosin Iβ.RESULTSThree different calmodulin Ca2+ binding site mutants, termed E12Q, E34Q, and E1234Q (25Mukherjea P. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), were used in this study. In each protein, particular Ca2+-binding sites were inactivated by mutation of a conserved glutamate residue (at position 12 of the Ca2+-binding loops) to glutamine. In E12Q the two N-terminal sites were mutated, in E34Q the two C-terminal sites were mutated, and in E1234Q, all four sites carried the mutation.Wild-type calmodulin and each of the calmodulin mutants was coexpressed with myosin Iβ heavy chain in insect Sf9 cells, and the expressed myosin Iβ was isolated. All of the calmodulin mutants copurified with myosin Iβ heavy chain, suggesting that the mutations do not affect the binding of calmodulin to myosin Iβ heavy chain. The ability of Ca2+ to increase electrophoretic mobility, a characteristic of wild-type calmodulin, was examined for each of these three mutants (Fig. 1). Wild type calmodulin migrated with an apparent molecular mass of 16 kDa in 5 mm Ca2+ but with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa in the presence of 1 mm EGTA. E12Q calmodulin mutant migrated at 22 kDa in EGTA but at 19 kDa in the presence Ca2+. On the other hand, E34Q migrated at 21 and 18 kDa in the absence and presence of Ca2+, respectively. The mobility shift by Ca2+ was abolished with E1234Q calmodulin mutant, which migrated at 21 kDa under both conditions. These results confirm that the calmodulin light chain associated with the myosin Iβ heavy chain in each preparation is indeed the expressed recombinant calmodulin mutant, and not endogenous calmodulin. They also suggest that the effect of mutating the two N-terminal Ca2+ binding sites on the conformational change of calmodulin is different from that of mutating the two C-terminal sites.Ca2+-induced conformational changes in the calmodulin mutants were further monitored as a function of Ca2+concentration by use of the reporter molecule 9-AC bromide. The Ca2+-induced appearance of hydrophobic sites on calmodulin is revealed by the enhanced fluorescence of 9-AC upon binding to these sites, and this technique has been used previously to examine the Ca2+ binding and conformational properties of Ca2+ binding site mutants of calmodulin (20Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 9-AC fluorescence enhancement for wild type calmodulin as a function of Ca2+ concentration is shown in Fig.2. A single transition is detected, with midpoint at a Ca2+ concentration (10−7) that is lower than the dissociation constant for the high affinity sites on calmodulin. This finding probably reflects increased overall affinity for Ca2+ and increased cooperativity of Ca2+binding induced by 9-AC. The hydrophobic reporter 1-anilino-8-naphtalene sulfonate has been shown previously to increase the affinity of calmodulin for Ca2+ (29Keller C.H. Olwin B.B. Heideman W. Storm D.R. Cheung W.Y. Calcium and Cell Function. 3. Academic Press, New York1982: 103-127Google Scholar). The curve for the E12Q (see Fig. 2) is very similar to the wild type curve at low Ca2+ concentrations but shows no increase in fluorescence enhancement at Ca2+ concentrations above pCa 6. This is consistent with induction of a conformational change as a result of Ca2+ binding to the two intact C-terminal sites present on this protein followed by absence of Ca2+ binding and the associated conformational change in the N-terminal domain. In contrast, the E34Q mutant shows no fluorescence enhancement at low Ca2+ and relatively minor enhancement of fluorescence with a midpoint at about pCa 6 as Ca2+ levels are increased. Thus a major conformational change normally associated with C-terminal high affinity sites is lost in the E34Q mutant leaving a smaller conformational change associated Ca2+ binding in the intact N-terminal domain. The sum of the fluorescence changes for E12Q and E34Q equals the changes for the wild type calmodulin (Fig. 2). The E1234Q mutant showed no change in 9-AC fluorescence throughout the entire pCa range tested (data not shown).Figure 2Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin as a function of Ca2+ concentration. Binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin was monitored by measuring 9-anthroylcholine bromide fluorescence curves of EGTA titration of wild-type and mutant calmodulin. Calmodulin in 0.5 mmCa2+ is titrated by addition of EGTA. pH values were 7.04 prior to titration and 7.07 at the end of titration. ■, wild type; ⋄, E12Q; ○, E34QView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin is coupled to actomyosin cross-bridge turnover. In order to examine the effect of Ca2+ binding at the N- and C-terminal sites of calmodulin on myosin Iβ mechanoenzymatic function, actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin Iβ containing the mutant calmodulins was measured as a function of Ca2+ (Fig.3). For all assays, the timecourse of Pi liberation was determined and the activity was estimated from the slope of the Pi release timecourse. Unlike myosin Iβ-containing wild-type calmodulin, for which Mg2+-ATPase activity increased in both the absence and presence of F-actin with Ca2+ concentration above pCa 6 (Fig.3 A), myosin Iβ-containing mutant calmodulin showed different Ca2+ dependencies. The ATPase activity of E12Q myosin Iβ started to increase below pCa 6 and reached maximum at pCa 6 (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, the ATPase activities of myosin Iβ containing both E34Q and E1234Q mutants did not show any Ca2+ dependence (Fig. 3,C and D). The activity of myosin Iβ containing these two mutant calmodulins was similar to that of myosin Iβ with wild-type calmodulin in EGTA, suggesting that Ca2+ binding to calmodulin in the C-terminal domain induced the enhancement of ATPase activity. These data suggest that the Ca2+-dependence of actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Iβ is mediated through Ca2+ binding to calmodulin and that the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites (high affinity sites) have a more important role in the Ca2+sensitivity of myosin Iβ ATPase activity.Figure 3Effects of Ca2+ on actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin Iβ containing various calmodulin mutants as its light chains. Actin-activated ATPase activity is assayed with 20 μg/ml in reaction buffers of differentpCa in the absence of actin (■), or in the presence of 50 μm actin (⋄) (n = 3).

Wild-type, E12Q, E34Q, and E1234Q myosin Iβ were all able to translocate actin filament at a rate about 0.3 μm/s in the presence of EGTA. The value agrees well with the one reported in the previous study (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). While switching motility buffer from 1 mm EGTA to 1 or 10 μm Ca2+abolished the actin filament movement for wild-type and E12Q myosin Iβ, it had little effect on the motility activity of E34Q and E1234Q myosin Iβ. These results suggest that the Ca2+ regulation of motor activity of myosin Iβ is also mediated through the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin. They further demonstrate that the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites but not the two N-terminal sites are critical for this regulation.Table ICa2+ dependence of actin filament sliding velocity of myosin Iβ with different calmodulin mutantsMyosin Iβ associated withSliding velocityEGTApCa 6pCa 5μm/sWild-type calmodulin0.33 ± 0.0300E12Q calmodulin0.20 ± 0.0600E34Q calmodulin0.34 ± 0.020.32 ± 0.040.28 ± 0.02E1234Q calmodulin0.28 ± 0.060.29 ± 0.080.20 ± 0.03 Open table in a new tab The effects of Ca2+ on the binding of the various calmodulins to myosin Iβ heavy chain were also examined (Fig.4). Purified myosin Iβ containing each calmodulin mutant was coprecipitated with F-actin at various Ca2+ concentrations, and the precipitated myosin Iβ and calmodulin were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophroesis followed by densitometry analysis to quantify the stoichiometry of the bound calmodulin. It is known that 3 mol of calmodulin bind to 1 mol of myosin Iβ heavy chain (13Zhu T. Sata M. Ikebe M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 513-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For wild-type calmodulin, one of the three molecules of bound calmodulin was dissociated from the heavy chain above pCa 5 (Fig. 4 A). On the other hand, for E12Q myosin Iβ, the dissociation of calmodulin was observed at lower Ca2+ (i.e. pCa 6) (Fig.4 B). In contrast, Ca2+ had no effect on the binding of E34Q calmodulin, i.e. all three calmodulin molecules were associated with the heavy chain even at pCa 4 (Fig. 4 C). As expected, the binding of E1234Q mutant calmodulin to the heavy chain showed no Ca2+sensitivity (Fig. 4 D).Figure 4Effects of Ca2+ on association of calmodulin with myosin Iβ heavy chain. Molar ratio of calmodulin to myosin Iβ heavy chain under different pCa conditions is determined according to “Materials and Methods” (n= 2).

The importance of the carbonyl side chain of this glutamic acid to the Ca2+ coordination system was revealed by crystallographic studies of calmodulin (30Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). As expected, the Ca2+-binding abilities of the mutated sites are completely abolished, based upon the Ca2+ binding induced conformational changes probed by the fluorescent hydrophobic reporter molecule, 9-AC. The results are consistent with the earlier study in which the conserved glutamic acid residue in each individual Ca2+-binding site was mutated (20Beckingham K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6027-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The fluorescence titration results show that the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites have a higher affinity for Ca2+ than the two N-terminal sites. The different electrophoretic mobility of calmodulin in the presence of EGTA as compared with Ca2+ also reflects conformational changes upon Ca2+ occupation. The obtained results suggest that the conformational change caused by Ca2+ binding to the two N-terminal sites (E34Q) is different from that caused by Ca2+ binding to the two C-terminal sites (E12Q); occupation of the two C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites has a greater impact on the overall conformational change. This is consistent with the previous findings that the Ca2+ binding at the C-terminal sites of calmodulin induces a larger conformational change (31Klee C.B. Mol. Asp. Cell. Regul. 1988; 5: 35-56Google Scholar). Recent structural studies suggest that the C-terminal domain of calmodulin exists in a semi-open conformation in contrast to the close conformation of the N-terminal domain in the absence of Ca2+, and it changes to an open conformation upon Ca2+ binding (32Swindell M.B. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This may explain the difference of the mobility shift between E12Q and E34Q.The present results clearly indicate that the effects of Ca2+ on the properties of myosin Iβ molecule,i.e. the change in actin-activated ATPase activity, actin sliding motor activity, and the dissociation of calmodulin light chains at high Ca2+ concentration are mediated through calmodulin, and that its two high affinity C-terminal Ca2+-binding sites are critical for the regulatory effect of Ca2+.For myosin Iβ associated with E12Q, the effects of Ca2+on actin-activated ATPase activity, motor activity, and the calmodulin dissociation are similar to those for myosin Iβ associated with wild-type calmodulin. On the other hand, the disruption of the Ca2+-binding sites in the C-terminal domain of calmodulin abolishes the Ca2+ dependence of the ATPase activity, the motor activity of myosin Iβ, and the dissociation of 1 mol of calmodulin from the heavy chain at above pCa 6. These results suggest that Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal domain of calmodulin, i.e. high affinity Ca2+ binding sites, is responsible for the dissociation of one calmodulin molecule from myosin Iβ heavy chain. The increase in ATPase activity parallels the dissociation of one molecule of calmodulin according to the Ca2+ dependence data (Fig. 4), thus it is reasonable to conclude that the dissociation of calmodulin increases myosin Iβ ATPase activity. It should be noted, however, actin independent ATPase activity but not actin dependent activity increases with Ca2+. Similar result has also been found for conventional myosin in which the dissociation of regulatory light chain increases basal myosin ATPase activity (33Lowey S. Waller G.S. Trybus K.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 450-454Crossref Scopus (265) Google Scholar). It should be noted that while the deletion of the Ca2+ binding at the N-terminal domain of calmodulin did not prevent the dissociation of 1 mol of calmodulin from the heavy chain, it shifted the Ca2+ required for calmodulin dissociation to lower concentration. This result suggests that there is a cross-talk between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains and that deletion of the Ca2+ binding ability at the N-terminal domain of calmodulin affects the conformational change at the C-terminal domain of calmodulin. This is consistent with the earlier finding that conformation of the Tyr-138 in the C-terminal domain of calmodulin is significantly influenced by a change in the Ca2+ binding properties of the N-terminal domain (25Mukherjea P. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Clearly, the binding of Ca2+ to calmodulin at the C-terminal sites is critical for the inhibition of actin translocating activity of myosin Iβ by Ca2+, since this Ca2+-induced inhibition of the motility was not observed with myosin Iβ containing E34Q or E1234Q calmodulin (Table I). However, it is more complicated to determine whether or not the dissociation of the calmodulin molecule from myosin Iβ heavy chain is critical for the inhibition of the motor activity. Thus, although the wild-type myosin Iβ still binds all three calmodulin light chains atpCa 6, its motor activity is completely inhibited at this Ca2+ concentration. One possible explanation is that although the C-terminal domain of the one calmodulin molecule is dissociated from myosin Iβ heavy chain at pCa 6, the N-terminal domain is still associated with the heavy chain at this Ca2+ concentration, and further conformational change induced by Ca2+ binding at the N-terminal low affinity sites of this molecule is necessary for the complete dissociation (Fig.5). Presumably, this incomplete association of calmodulin with myosin Iβ is no longer able to support motor activity. For the E12Q mutant, the conformational change induced by the binding of Ca2+ to the higher affinity sites may be sufficient to dissociate calmodulin from myosin Iβ heavy chain. It should be noted, however, Ca2+ binding to calmodulin dissociates only one of the three bound calmodulin from myosin Iβ heavy chain. According to the amino acid sequence, myosin Iβ has three IQ motifs, one of which is not a completely matched IQ motif, IQXXXRGXXXR (one-letter amino acid code; X is any amino acid residue) (6Zhu T. Ikebe M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is plausible that the calmodulin bound to the incomplete IQ motif is dissociated from myosin Iβ when Ca2+ binds to the C-terminal domain. Alternatively, the conformational change in all three calmodulin upon Ca2+ binding to the C-terminal domain results in the inhibition of motility and the additional conformational change upon the Ca2+ binding at the N-terminal low affinity sites destabilizes the association of one of the bound calmodulin to the heavy chain presumably due to steric hindrance. Further studies are needed to clarify the reason why only one"

This gene is transcribed as an mRNA of 2.7 kilobases (kb) that encodes a 60-kDa MAZ protein. A 40-kb cosmid clone was isolated that includes the promoter, five exons, four introns, and one 3′-untranslated region. All exon-intron junction sequences conform to the GT/AG rule. The promoter region has features typical of a housekeeping gene: a high G + C content (88.4%); a high frequency of CpG dinucleotides, in particular within the region 0.5 kb upstream of the site of initiation of translation; and the absence of canonical TATA and CAAT boxes. An S1 nuclease protection assay demonstrated the presence of multiple sites for initiation of transcription around a site 174 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the ATG codon and such expression was reflected by the promoter activity of a MAZ promoter/CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) reporter gene. Cis-acting positive and negative elements controlling basal transcription of the human MAZ gene were found from nucleotides (nt) −383 to −248 and nt −2500 to −948. Moreover, positive and negative autoregulatory elements were also identified in the regions from nt −248 to −189 and from nt −383 to −248 after co-transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids that carried theMAZ promoter/CAT construct and the MAZ-expression vector.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate regulation of expression of the human c-myc gene is necessary for the proliferation and differentiation of cells and for progression of the cell cycle, and deregulation of the expression of c-myc is associated with tumorigenesis and apoptosis (1Cole M.D. Annu.

In proliferating cells, the initiation of transcription of the c-myc gene is controlled by two major promoters, P1 and P2, and the RNA initiated from the P2 promoter accounts for 80–90% of the total RNA initiated from the P0, P1, and P2 promoters (4Marcu K.B.

Therefore, MAZ appears to be a transcription factor with a dual role in the initiation and termination of transcription. We showed previously that MAZ is essential for the ME1a1-mediated expression of the c-myc gene during the neuroectodermal differentiation of P19 cells (18Komatsu M. Li H. Tsutsui H. Itakura K. Matsumura M. Yokoyama K.K. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and for the nuclease-hypersensitive element-mediated transcription of the c-myc gene in islet β-cells (13Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To gain a better understanding of the regulation of expression of MAZ, of the splicing mechanism, of the differential polyadenylation and of the potential interactions of MAZ with other factors, we isolated a human genomic gene for MAZ from cosmid and YAC libraries. We characterized the genomic structure of the gene for MAZ protein and identified regulatory elements in 5′-end flanking sequences that are involved in basal transcription and in the autoregulation of the gene for MAZ by the MAZ protein itself. pCMV-MAZ was constructed as described previously (13Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). MAZ-CAT reporter plasmids, namely pMAZCAT0, pMAZCAT1, pMAZCAT2, pMAZCAT3, pMAZCAT4, pMAZCAT5, and pMAZCAT6 were constructed by digesting the DNA of the promoter region withHindIII/XmnI, StuI/XmnI,MscI/XmnI, DpnI/XmnI,PvuII/XmnI, BssHII/XmnI, and HgaI/XmnI, respectively, and then subcloning, via the pHindIII linker, into the HindIII site of pSV00CAT (19Araki E. Shimada F. Shichiri M. Moro M. Ebina Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, deletion mutants, namely, pMAZCAT2-d and pMAZCAT3-d, were constructed by digesting the insert DNA of pMAZCAT2 or pMAZCAT3 with DpnI/PvuII orPvuII/BssHII, respectively, and subcloning into the HindIII site of the pSV00CAT vector. A cosmid library (20Kawai J. Ando A. Sato T. Nakatsuji T. Tsuji K. Inoko H. J.

The library was screened by colony hybridization with 1.8- and 0.7-kb EcoRI fragments ofMAZ cDNA from pCMVMAZ (13Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Filters were prehybridized at 68 °C for 30 min in a solution that contained 6 × SSC (1 × SSC: 150 mm sodium chloride, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution (0.1% Ficoll (type 400; Pharmacia LKB, Uppsala, Sweden), 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% bovine serum albumin (fraction V; Sigma)), 0.1% SDS, and 0.1 mg/ml denatured calf-thymus DNA and then hybridized in the same buffer supplemented with 1 × 106 cpm/ml of radioactive probe at 68 °C for 20 h. The hybridization probe for MAZ was prepared by the random primed labeling method (22Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 6-13Crossref Scopus (16653) Google Scholar) using a Random Primed DNA Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Filters were washed three times at room temperature for 20 min in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and once at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and then exposed to XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) with an intensifying screen. A 40-kb DNA insert of a cosmid clone was digested with EcoRI and then subcloned into the pBluescriptII SK+ vector (Stratagene) for further studies. The human MAZ-yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) recombinant clones, y645D4 and y976H4 were isolated from a library of CGM1 DNA (CHEF, Paris, France) by PCR-mediated methods according to the protocol provided by CHEF.

Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed with the GCG program (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol.

The blots were hybridized and washed before autoradiography as described elsewhere (21Sambrook D. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A 1.8-kbEcoRI fragment of cDNA for MAZ and a 0.6-kbEcoRI/BamHI fragment of the human DNA (−1.0 kb to −0.4 kb relative to the major site of initiation of transcription) were radiolabeled for use as DNA probes for further hybridization. Total RNA from HeLa cells or human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) was prepared by the guanidine thiocyanate method, as described elsewhere (21Sambrook D. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). S1 nuclease protection was conducted essentially as described previously (26Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Smith J.A. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley, New York1987Google Scholar) using a 208-nt probe (nt −98 to 106) generated by the digestion of the promoter region of MAZ DNA with SmaI. The sizes of protected fragments were determined from comparisons with nucleotide sequencing ladders prepared from the protected DNA fragments with a Sequence 7-deaza-d-GTP kit (version 2.0) from Amersham. Fluorescent in situhybridization was performed as described by Ozawa et al. (27Ozawa K. Murakami Y. Eki Y. Soeda E. Yokoyama K. Genomics. 1992; 12: 214-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Metaphase preparations were obtained from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human male lymphocytes after synchronization with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (Sigma). The cosmid DNA was labeled with biotin-14-dATP (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) by nick-translation as described elsewhere (28Lichter P. Chang-Tang C.J. Call K. Hennanson G. Evans G.A. Housman D. Ward D.C. Science. 1990; 247: 64-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). After hybridization, slides were washed, blocked, and incubated with rabbit antibodies against biotin (Enzo Diagnostic, Inc., New York) Slides were then incubated with second and third antibodies (goat antibodies against rabbit IgG and rabbit antibodies against goat IgG) conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. After washing and drying, slides were counterstained with propidium iodide in anti-bleach mounting medium. Slides were examined under an Optiphot microscope (UFX-IIA; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and photographs were taken on Ektachrome 400 film (Kodak). Then, chromosomes were subjected to Q-band staining. The localization of fluorescent signals on chromosomes was determined under a fluoresence microscope and photographed under the bright field of a light microscope with Minicopy HR II film (Fuji-Film Co., Kanagawa, Japan). HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and 60 μg/ml kanamycin (Sigma). Transfections for assays of short-term expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) were performed as described elsewhere (29Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell.

After sonication, each crude extract was incubated for 10 min at 60 °C to denature proteinases (30Kitabayashi I. Kawakami Z. Chin R. Ozawa K. Matsuoka T. Toyoshima S. Umesono K. Evans R.M.

The extent of conversion of chloramphenicol to its acetylated form was determined with a Bio-Image analyzer (model BAS 2000; Fuji). β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Katoh et al. (31Katoh S. Ozawa K. Kondoh S. Soeda E. Israel A. Shiroki K. Fujinaga K. Itakura K. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The ratio of CAT activity to that of β-galactosidase was used for normalization of results (31Katoh S. Ozawa K. Kondoh S. Soeda E. Israel A. Shiroki K. Fujinaga K. Itakura K. Gachelin G. Yokoyama K.

Each polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carrried out in a total volume of 20 μl that contained 10 ng of each primer, 10 ng of DNA, 200 μm each dNTP, ΔTth polymerase buffer (Toyobo, Kyoto, Japan), and 2.5 units of ΔTth polymerase (Toyobo). Samples were heated at 96 °C for 2 min to denature the template DNA and then subjected to 30 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s in a DNA thermal cycler (9600 model; Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). The products of PCR were separated by electrophoresis on a 8% acrylamide gel. The reaction mixture for RT-PCR containing cDNA (equivalent to 20 or 25 ng of total RNA), specific primer sets (5 pmol each), 50 μm dNTPs, 1 × buffer for KOD Dash and 0.5 units of KOD Dash (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was subjected to a DNA thermal cycler. Samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min to denature the tenmplate DNA and then subjected to 25 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 40 s and 72 °C for 40 s. Sequences of primers forMAZ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were as follows: sense primer, 5′-TTCCTTGCACGCTGCTG-3′; antisense primer, 5′-CCTGGAATGGGACTCTGG-3′ and sense primer, 5′-TCCACCACCCTGCTGCTGTA-3′; antisense primer, 5′-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3′, respectively. The products were resolved on a polyacrylamide gel (8%) and stained with VistraGreen (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Human normal diploid cells (WI-38) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 60 μg/ml kanamycin. To induce the arrest of WI-38 cells in the G0 phase, cells were allowed to grow exponentially in monolayer and maintained for 30 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS. Arrested cells were switched to incubation in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and then harvested at 6-h intervals as indicated. G0-arrested cells were also maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS in the presence of 1 mmhydroxyurea (Sigma) for 24 h for resynchronization in early S phase. The cells were then incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 7.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) for another 12 h for accumulation of cells in the G2 phase. Cells were lysed and boiled for 3 min at 90 °C and then lysates were sonicated for 10 s. The sonicates were fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamidg gel electophoresis (8% polyacrylamide) and then proteins were electroblotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride-nylon membrane (Daiichi Pure Chemicals Co., Tokyo, Japan). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk in PBS-T (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) for 1 h at 25 °C and then washed three times with PBS-T. The membrane was incubated with 1000-fold diluted polyclonal antibodies against MAZ (13Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Komatsu M. Li H. Tsutsui H. Itakura K. Matsumura M. Yokoyama K.K.

Antibodies that had bound to the membrane were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies against mouse immunoglobin G (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) and ECL detection reagents (Amersham Japan). Screening of a cosmid library of the genomic DNA from human B-lymphoblastoid AKIBA cells with the 1.8- and 0.7-kbEcoRI fragment of the coding region and the untranslated region of pMAZi cDNA, respectively (13Tsutsui H. Sakatsume O. Itakura K. Yokoyama K.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), as probe yielded seven clones. DNA from the seven cosmid clones was digested withEcoRI and then allowed to hybridize with the same 1.8-kb DNA probe. A single 9.0-kb EcoRI fragment was detected in all seven cosmid clones and subcloned into BluescriptII SK+. The complete restriction maps of the seven subclones were identical. From one of the seven subclones, pJSMAZ9.0E, we further subcloned the 1.3-kb PstI-PstI fragment and the 3.5-kbPstI-EcoRI fragment into pBluescriptII SK+ to generate pJSMAZ1.3P/P and pJSMAZ3.5P/E, respectively. A 1.1-kb EcoRI fragment adjacent to the inserted DNA of pJSMAZ9.0E was also isolated and further subcloned into pBluescriptII SK+ to generate pJSMAZ1.1E. These plasmids, pJSMAZ1.3P/P, pJSMAZ3.5P/E, and pJSMAZ1.1E were fully sequenced and characterized (Fig. 1).Figure 1Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the human gene for MAZ.

The locations of five exons and four introns within the 6.0 kb of human genomic DNA cloned in this study are shown in Fig. 1. Both the 5′- and the 3′-splice junctions and the sizes of exons and introns are shown in Table I. The exons were small, with the exception of exon 5, which extended over 1028 nucleotides. Similarly, the introns were relatively small, ranging from 84 to 277 bp, with the exception of intron 4, which extended over 1.3 kb of DNA. The region that encoded the zinc finger motif of the MAZ protein extended from exon 2 to exon 4 and was interrupted by two introns. The 3′-untranslated region of the MAZ gene that we isolated was about 1.1 kb in length (Figs. 1 and2 and Table I). We also isolated two human MAZ-YAC recombinant clones, y645D4 and y976H4, from a YAC library of EB virus-transformed human peripheral lymphocytes (CGM1). The two cloned YACs spanned 560 kb of DNA that included theMAZ gene (Fig. 2). The NotI DNA fragment covered the entire genomic region of the MAZ gene and was subcloned into the pWE15 vector for generation of a physical map of the inserted DNA. The nucleotide sequence of the MAZ gene in the YAC clones was identical to that of the cloned cosmid DNA (data not shown).Table ISequences of intron/exon junctions in the human gene for MAZExonExon size5′ Splice donorIntron size3′ Splice acceptorAmino acid interruptedbpbp1363CCATTCCAG gtgagtga…84…ctccgcag GCCGCGCCGGln-442851CTTCTCCCG gtgtgcac…403…gtccccag GCCGGATCAArg-348364AAATGTGAG gtaggaag…277…ctcctcag AAATGTGAGGlu-3694172GCAACAAAG gtacatgc…1335…ctgtgcag GTACTGGTGGly-42751028AAAATCCTG tttctggct…ConsensusAG gt(a/g)cag GCNote: exon sequences are given in uppercase letters and intron sequences are given in lowercase letters.

We compared the genomic MAZ sequence with corresponding sequences of cDNAs for members of the MAZ family that had been reported previously (9Bossone S.A. Asselin C. Patel A.J. Marcu K.B. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7452-7456Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10Pyrc J.J. Moberg K.H. Hall D.J.

A. 1992; 89: 11498-11502Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We found relatively limited homology in the 5′-flanking region even though the sequences of the coding regions of these genomic and cDNA clones were identical (Fig.3). To examine whether the human genome contains several MAZgenes, we designed 5′-end primers on the basis of the 5′-end upstream sequences of human genomic MAZ DNA and two representative cDNAs (see Fig. 3 b; 13, 15). The 3′-end primers corresponded to the conserved sequences in the genomic MAZgene. Then human total genomic DNA and mixtures of cDNA were used as templates for PCR. The primer combinations corresponding to the genomic MAZ sequences resulted in successful amplification, while with MAZi and clone 33813 cDNAs, we failed to amplify any DNA fragments (Fig. 3 c). Thus, the differences in the 5′-flanking regions of both MAZi and clone 33819 cDNAs might have been due to artifacts in cloning due to the high G + C content of this region. Alternatively, differential splicing is also a possible explanation in the case of MAZi. Detailed characterization of the physical map and the nucleotide sequences of YAC-MAZ clones supported this conclusion (data not shown). A particular striking feature of the MAZ gene was its high G + C content. The average G + C content of the 6.0-kb genomicMAZ DNA was 68.9%; that of the upstream 2.5-kb part of the 6.0-kb genomic MAZ DNA was 76.2% and that of the downstream 2.5-kb part of the 6.0-kb genomic MAZ DNA was 61.2%. The 500-bp region upstream of the ATG initiation codon had a G + C content of 88.4%. It is noteworthy that two regions of 71 and 77 bp (nt −103 to −33 and nt −306 to −230 relative to the ATG codon, respectively), had extremely high G + C contents of 98.6 and 97.4%, respectively (Fig. 4). The GC-rich region contained restriction sites for some rare “CG cutters,” such as NarI, BssHI"

With this sequence an open reading frame was identified encoding a predicted polypeptide with juxtaposed eIF2α kinase and histidyl-tRNA synthetase-related domains. The 1646 amino acid sequence of this gene, called cpc-3, showed 35% positional identity over almost the entire sequence with GCN2 of yeast, which stimulates translation of the transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes encoded by GCN4. Strains disrupted for cpc-3 were unable to induce increased transcription and derepression of amino acid biosynthetic enzymes in amino acid-deprived cells. The cpc-3 mutation did not affect the ability to up-regulate mRNA levels of cpc-1, encoding theGCN4 homologue and transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in N. crassa, but the mutation abolished the dramatic increase of CPC1 protein level in response to amino acid deprivation. These findings suggest that cpc-3 is the functional homologue of GCN2, being required for increased translation of cpc-1 mRNA in amino acid-starved cells.

In lower eukaryotes, like Neurospora crassa andSaccharomyces cerevisiae, starvation for any one of a number of amino acids leads to simultaneously induced transcription followed by derepression of the enzymes in many amino acid biosynthetic pathways. The global regulatory mechanism is referred to as general amino acid control (discovered as “cross-pathway control” inN. crassa, see Refs. 1Carsiotis M. Jones R.F. J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) on Ser-51. GTP-bound eIF2 is necessary for delivering charged initiator tRNAMet(Met-tRNAiMet) to the 40 S ribosomal subunits, and after initiation of translation it is released as eIF2·GDP. The phosphorylated form of eIF2 sequesters its own recycling factor eIF2B necessary for exchange of GDP by GTP (11Pavitt G.D. Ramaiah K.V. Kimball S.R. Hinnebusch A.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 514-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). As only the GTP-bound form of eIF2 is able to initiate translation, sequestering of eIF2B leads to a general reduction of protein synthesis. However, activation of GCN2 in yeast leads to increased translation of one mRNA species, GCN4 mRNA. This gene-specific regulation is mediated by four short upstream open reading frames (uORF) in the 5′ leader of GCN4 mRNA (4Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Extensive genetic analysis of the GCN4 mRNA leader has provided a detailed model for GCN4 translational regulation (4Hinnebusch A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21661-21664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Irrespective of amino acid availability, the first uORF is translated, and about 50% of the ribosomes resume scanning on the mRNA. Under non-starvation conditions translation of the following three uORFs leads to dissociation of almost all the ribosomes from the mRNA due to specific sequences surrounding the translational stop codons, and therefore translation of GCN4 is prevented. Under amino acid starvation conditions GCN2 becomes activated and phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to low levels of GTP-bound eIF2 and, therefore, reduced concentration of eIF2·GTP·Met-tRNAiMet ternary complexes. Consequently, after translation of uORF1, ribosomes resume scanning, but the rate at which they rebind ternary complexes is lowered. Thus, ribosomes are less able to re-initiate at any of the translation initiation sites of the following three uORFs, and many re-initiate at GCN4 instead. So far three eIF2α kinases are known that share extensive homology in the kinase catalytic domain. Apart from the 12 conserved subdomains found in most protein kinases, they have additional characteristic features, including an insert between subdomains IV and VI and subdomains IX and X, respectively, which distinguishes them from other serine/threonine kinases (10Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2271) Google Scholar). However, each of these kinases are activated by distinct stimuli as follows: the heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) in rabbit and rat by heme deficiency (13Chen J.-J. Throop M.S. Gehrke L. Kuo I.

Chem. 1997; 272: 12544-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition to the kinase catalytic domain, each eIF2α kinase contains unique sequences that may be responsible for its own characteristic regulation. For example PKR contains two double-stranded RNA-binding motifs required for RNA binding (19Proud C.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 241-246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 20Robertson H.D. Mathews M.B. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Within the kinase catalytic domain of HRI, two heme regulatory motifs are known (21Chen J.-J. London I.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 105-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 22de Haro C. Mendez R. Santoyo J. FASEB J. 1997; 10: 1378-1387Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Adjacent to the eIF2α kinase catalytic domain, GCN2 contains a domain that resembles the histidyl-tRNA synthetases (HisRS), which was postulated to monitor amino acid availability (8Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebush A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4579-4583Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Early work by various N. crassa and yeast researchers (23Sachs M.S. Brambl R. Marzluf G.A. The Mycota: Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 4. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1996: 315-345Google Scholar) indicated that uncharged aminoacyl-tRNAs that accumulate in amino acid-deprived cells are the relevant signal in the mechanism of general control. Mutations in the HisRS-like domain of GCN2 were found to impair phosphorylation of Ser-51 of eIF2α and the derepression ofGCN4 mRNA translation in amino acid-starved cells. Weket al. (9Wek S.A.

Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and the C-terminal region beyond the HisRS-like domain are also required for GCN2 function (25Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For the latter, Ramirez et al. (25Ramirez M. Wek R. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3027-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) demonstrated a function in ribosome association of the protein and a role in dimerization was recently elucidated as well (89Qiu H. Garcia-Barrio M.T. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2697-2711Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, where GCN2 and several other elements were identified genetically by abundant mutations that impair general amino acid control, all but one of the regulation-deficient mutations of N. crassa mapped in the cpc-1 gene (26Davis R.H. Genetics. 1979; 93: 557-575PubMed Google Scholar, 27Barthelmess I.B. Genet. Res. 1982; 39: 169-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Catcheside D.E.A. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1991; 38: 71Google Scholar). The one exception was a mutation that identified the cpc-2gene (30Krüger D. Koch J. Barthelmess I.B. Curr. Genet. 1990; 18: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 31Müller F. Krüger D. Sattlegger E. Hoffmann B. Ballario P. Kanaan M. Barthelmess I.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 248: 162-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, cpc-2 of N. crassa showed no relationship with any of the known yeast genes involved in general amino acid control. We were interested, therefore, to find out whether substantial differences exist in the details of the mechanism of amino acid regulation between these ascomycetes and searched for a N. crassa gene with homology to yeast GCN2. Here the molecular identification of the N. crassa cpc-3gene and its characterization as a structural homologue of yeastGCN2 is reported. The molecular engineering of acpc-3 disruption allele and the phenotypic consequences of the loss of function are described. Our results show that thecpc-3 product is a positive regulator of the general control response of N. crassa and most likely functions as a translational activator of cpc-1, analogous to the function of yeast GCN2. The N. crassawild-type strain (St. Lawrence 74A) and the strains cyh-2,A, arg-12 s ,a arg-12 − ,awere obtained from the Fungal Genetics Stock Center (FGSC, University of Kansas Medical Center); the cpc-1(j-5) andcpc-2(U142) mutant strains were from the Barthelmess lab. N. crassa cultivation on Vogel's standard medium and crossing techniques followed Davis and de Serres (32Davis R.H. deSerres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 57: 79-143Google Scholar). Briefly, for enzyme assays and DNA, RNA, and protein isolation, exponentially grown mycelium was obtained by inoculation of 100 ml of liquid medium with 0.5–1 × 106 conidia and incubation overnight at 29 °C and 170 rpm. For growth tests 1 ml of stagnant liquid medium was inoculated with mycelial slants and incubated at 29 °C. If required, Vogel's medium was supplemented with final concentrations of 0.5 μg/ml benomyl, 1 μg/ml cycloheximide, 250 or 333 μg/ml (liquid or solid medium) hygromycin B, 4 or 6 mm (stagnant liquid or exponential culture) 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3AT), and 40 mm acetate (omitting glucose), respectively. All supplements were prepared as stock solutions, sterile-filtered, and added to the autoclaved medium. The ordered N. crassagenomic cosmid library of Vollmer and Yanofsky (33Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4867-4873Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) was used to screen for cpc-3 sequences. Plasmids used in this study were pCPC1-2 for cpc-1 (3Paluh J.L.

Newsl. 1989; 36: 79-81Google Scholar). DNA fragments were cloned, and the cpc-3 disruption allele was constructed in pBluescript SK. PCR amplification products were cloned in pUC19. E. coli strains used were DH1 for the cosmid library and XL-1 blue for all other purposes. Transformation ofE. coli was carried out according to Mandel and Higa (88Mandel M. Higa A. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 53: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1520) Google Scholar) or, in case of plasmids larger than 10 kb, via electroporation (37Jacobs M. Wnendt S. Stahl U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1653Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,38Zabarovsky E.R. Winberg G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Spheroblasts obtained from germinating conidia were used for transformation (33Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4867-4873Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Transformants were made homokaryotic via the isolation of microconidia-derived colonies (39Ebbole D.J. Sachs M.S. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1990; 37: 17-18Google Scholar). Isolation of high quality and pure genomic DNA from N. crassa followed the method of Leeet al. (40Lee S.B. Milgroom M.G. Taylor J.W. Neurospora Newsl. 1988; 35: 23-24Google Scholar). For PCR analysis of large numbers of genomic DNA samples the methods of Irelan et al. (41Irelan J. Miao V. Selker E.U. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1993; 40: 24Google Scholar) and Chow and Kaefer (42Chow T.Y.-K. Kaefer E. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1993; 40: 25-27Google Scholar) were combined as follows: N. crassa was incubated for 2 days in 1 ml of stagnant liquid culture. Mycelia were squeezed between Whatman paper and transferred to 0.2 ml of isolation buffer (0.2 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.01m EDTA, 1% SDS, pH 7.5). After addition of glass beads (0.3–0.4 mm diameter) and 0.2 ml of 1:1 phenol:chloroform the samples were vortexed for 5 min followed by addition of 0.3 ml of isolation buffer and 0.3 ml of phenol:chloroform and centrifugation (30 s, 5000 × g). The liquid phase was again extracted with 0.3 ml of phenol:chloroform. The DNA was precipitated with 1 ml of ethanol, dissolved in 100 μl of TE buffer (containing 100 μg/ml RNase) at 37 °C for about 1 h, ethanol-precipitated, and finally dissolved in 50 μl of TE buffer. Southern analysis followed standard protocols (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: E34-E35Google Scholar) using nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probes were labeled with DIG-11-dUTP (DIG-DNA random primed labeling kit, Boehringer Mannheim). Labeling of DNA shorter than 700 bp was performed by PCR reaction (see below, except that 13 of dTTP was replaced by DIG-dUTP), and the labeling reaction was used directly for hybridization. Hybridization and detection of probes and stripping of probes from membranes followed the manufacturer's protocol (DIG luminescent detection kit, Boehringer Mannheim). PCR reaction mixtures consisted of 1× PCR buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.3, Boehringer Mannheim), 200 μm of each dNTP, 500 nm each primer, 0.02 units/μl Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer or Boehringer Mannheim), and 5 ng/μl genomic DNA or 5 pg/μl plasmid/cosmid DNA. PCR of 10–100-μl volumes were performed in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler TC1; the cycles were 30 s at 95 °C (5 min in the first cycle), 1 min at the annealing temperature (5 °C lower than Tm, for degenerate primers see Table I). Extension time was 1 min per 1 kb at 72 °C.Table IOligonucleotide sequences used for PCR reactionsNamePositionSequence (from 5′ to 3′)Restriction enzymecpc-3, degenerated and sequence specific oligonucleotides 2.1 s2414atcgtcgaCTITTYATHCAGATGGAGTAITGYGA 42 °CSalI 2.3 a2653acaggatccGCIAGICCGAARTCICCHATYTT 42 °CBamHI 4.1 s1888cgtgcatgCTIGGRCAGGGIGGITTYGGICARGT 42 °CSphI 4.2 a2523GAATAAGCGCCAGATCTCABglII 5.1 s2586gccgtcgaCCACATTCACAGCCTCAACATCSalI 5.2 a3407gcccttaagCYCGITAICCYATICAITCYAGYAT 50 °CEcoRI 6.1 s3301cgaggtaCCATCTTCCGGCGACACKpnI 6.2 a4155atactgcAGRGTGTCGTAICGRCCRCCIGC 65 °CPstI 11.1 s511GAGATGATAGACCAGATTGTCGAAG 14.1 s−220attagatCTTCGTTTCCACCCAABglII 14.2 a612tctgaaTTCGCTCTGCGCTAACCTTEcoRIBml cassette BmlU stcaagatCTTCCACCCTTCCAAAAGTTTGACBglII BmlL atgcagATCTAAACAGACATTATCATCATCATGCABglIIhph cassette 11.2 aTTCAATATCATCTTCTGTCGACCTCLowercase letters indicate nucleotides added at the 5′ end for the construction of restriction sites (underlined).

For RT-PCR analysis cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript RT RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of the reverse transcription reaction mixture (10% (v/v) of final PCR reaction) were directly subjected to PCR reactions. Clones of each microtiter plate of the N. crassa ordered genomic cosmid library (33Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4867-4873Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar) were pooled, and pure DNA was isolated (plasmid midikit, Qiagen). By using 1 μg DNA of each pool, a dot blot membrane was generated and screened using cpc-3-specific sequences as probes (hybridization technique as described for Southern analysis). To identify the individual positive clones, colonies of each microtiter plate of interest were transferred to solid medium with a microtiter replica plater and subjected to colony hybridization (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: E34-E35Google Scholar). Isolation of total cellular RNA and preparation of Northern blots were done according to Sokolowsky et al. (44Sokolowsky V. Kaldenhoff R. Ricci M. Russo V.E.A. Fungal Genet. Newsl. 1990; 37: 41-43Google Scholar) using 10 μg of RNA of each sample and nylon membranes (N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Probing was done according to Sambrook et al. (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: E34-E35Google Scholar). DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP (random-primed labeling kit, Life Technologies, Inc.) and purified on Sephadex columns (43Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: E34-E35Google Scholar). Probes were stripped from membranes by washing with 5% (w/v) SDS at 65 °C for at least 10 min. By using PCR, DNA sequences were determined by the Sanger dideoxy sequencing method (fmol sequencing kit, Promega). A 1.6-kb SmaI-EcoRI fragment of cpc-3 was commercially sequenced (LARK). DNA sequences were analyzed with programs DNASIS and PROSIS (Hitachi). Predicted amino acid sequences were compared with available protein sequences using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST, see Ref.45Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69694) Google Scholar). Multi-alignments were performed using the GCG program (46Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11534) Google Scholar). All assays were performed with crude extracts from freeze-dried mycelia. The specific activities ofl-ornithine carbamoyltransferase (EC 2.1.3.3) and citrate-synthase (EC 4.1.3.7) were assayed according to Davis (47Davis R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1962; 97: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) or Flavell and Fincham (48Flavell R.B. Fincham J.R.S. J. Bacteriol. 1968; 95: 1063-1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Crude cell extracts ofN. crassa were isolated by grinding fresh mycelium in liquid nitrogen, addition of equal volumes of breaking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton, 1 tablet of protein inhibitor mixture (complete, Boehringer Mannheim) per 50 ml of buffer, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol) and of glass beads (0.3–0.4 mm diameter), and subsequent vortexing 6 times for 30 s at 4 °C. After removal of cell debris (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C), Western blots were conducted by using precast gels and nitrocellulose membranes (NOVEX) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Detection of antigen-antibody complexes was performed by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Based on the amino acid sequences in the catalytic domains of eIF2α kinases (8Wek R.C. Jackson B.M. Hinnebush A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The oligonucleotides bracketed subdomain VI that contains amino acids characteristic of serine/threonine protein kinases and is surrounded by amino acids typical of eIF2α protein kinases. Knowledge of the sequence of PCR fragments amplified with these primers should be sufficient to determine whether or not they derived from a gene encoding an eIF2α kinase. By using genomic N. crassa DNA as template, a single 302-bp PCR product, called 2.1–2.3, was obtained using 2.1 and 2.3 as primers (Fig. 1 B) that encodes an amino acid sequence with 60% sequence identity to the corresponding yeast GCN2 segment. The 2.1–2.3 PCR product was used as a probe to isolate two cosmid clones (17:5D and 20:1F) from an ordered genomic library (33Vollmer S.J. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4867-4873Crossref Scopus (352) Google Scholar). By using cosmid 17:5D as template, and in each case a specific primer constructed from already sequenced areas, and a degenerate primer (see below), adjacent overlapping stretches of DNA were synthesized by PCR. Degenerate primer 4.1 was constructed according to characteristic amino acids of protein kinase subdomain I. Construction of degenerate primers 5.2 and 6.2, respectively, was guided by conserved sequences of HisRS proteins. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified fragments 4.1–4.2, 5.1–5.2, and 6.1–6.2 (Fig. 1 B) indicated that N. crassacontains a GCN2-like gene (i.e. encodes a protein characterized by juxtaposed kinase and HisRS-like domains). From PCR fragments and subcloned restriction fragments of cosmid 17:5D (Fig. 1 C), a restriction map was derived (Fig.1 A). Sequencing of PCR fragments and subcloned restriction fragments or direct sequencing of cosmid 17:5D DNA led to the determination of a DNA sequence with coding capacity for a GCN2-like polypeptide (Ref. 50Sattlegger E.

The serine/arginine proteins, a family of factors characterized by the presence of an RNA recognition motif and an arginine/serine domain, are essential for constitutive splicing and required for some alternative splicing decisions. ASF/SF2, SC35, and other members of the serine/arginine family, interact with the 70k protein of the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. The binding of this protein with ASF/SF2 is thought to enhance recognition of the 5′ splice site of pre-mRNAs by the U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. It has been clearly documented that the arginine/serine domain of ASF/SF2 is responsible for binding to the U1 70k protein. In this manuscript we characterize the segment in the human U1 70k protein that is both necessary and sufficient for ASF/SF2 binding. A domain within this segment, which begins with Arg240 and ends with Asp270, was shown to bind specifically to the arginine/serine domain of ASF/SF2 using a yeast two-hybrid system and a far Western assay. Mutational analysis of this segment suggested that several arginines are critical for the interaction with ASF/SF2 and for phosphorylation by SRPK1. Inspection of the sequence of the Arg248 to Asp270 region suggested this as an arginine/serine-like domain in U1 70k protein, and the data presented in this manuscript strongly support this view. Inspection of the human U1 70k protein sequence, comparison with homologues in other animal species, and mutational analysis indicated the importance of the sequence Arg-Arg-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ser-Arg-Asp, which is found repeated twice in the region from Arg248 to Asp270 in the human protein.

The superfamily of RS domain-containing splicing factors is composed of two subfamilies of proteins (reviewed in Ref. 16Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar).

Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5803-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Most SR proteins share two structural motifs: an RNA recognition motif (10Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 89-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and an RS domain (17Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The RS domain is essential for the in vivo function of the Drosophila melanogaster splicing regulator Suppressor of white apricot protein (SWAP) (27Li H. Bingham P.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and for the in vitroconstitutive splicing activity of ASF/SF2 (28Zuo P. Manley J.L.

The second subfamily is composed of SR protein-related factors and includes, among others, the splicing regulators Tra (30Boggs R.T. Gregor P. Idriss S. Belote J.M. McKeown M. Cell. 1987; 50: 739-747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and Tra-2 (31Amrein H. Gorman M. Nothiger R.

Cell. 1989; 56: 1011-1018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). U1 70k protein has also been included as a member of this second subfamily (16Fu X.D. RNA. 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar). Individual SR proteins function with varying efficiency in the splicing of different pre-mRNAs (26Cavaloc Y. Popielarz M. Fuchs J.P. Gattoni R. Stevenin J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2639-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 33Fu X.D. Nature. 1993; 365: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 34Zahler A.M. Neugebauer K.M. Lane W.S. Roth M.B. Science. 1993; 260: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Moreover, ASF/SF2 has been shown to be essential for viability in a chicken B cell line, indicating a unique role in vivo for this SR protein (35Wang J. Takagaki Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2588-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in other assays SR proteins can substitute for each other, suggesting that SR proteins have partially redundant functions in splicing in vitro (17Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A.

Cell. 1994; 76: 735-746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). ASF/SF2 and SC35 interact with U1 70k (9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 38Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar), and the ASF/SF2 RS domain is required for this interaction (9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The binding of ASF/SF2 and U1–70k is thought to stabilize the association of the 5′ splice site with the U1 snRNP. Similar interactions may explain the SR protein-mediated enhancement of U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNAs and U4·6,5 tri-snRNP to assembling spliceosomes (40Tarn W.Y. Steitz J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2504-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,41Roscigno R.F. Garcia-Blanco M.A. RNA. 1995; 1: 692-706PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the 70k equivalent in U2 snRNP has not been identified, the U5 snRNP-associated p27 contains a putative RS domain and is likely involved in binding SR proteins (42Petzer S. Lauber J. Will C.L. Luhrmann R. RNA. 1997; 3: 344-355PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between U1 70k and SR proteins may be a model for a broader set of interactions between snRNP proteins and SR proteins. We had previously shown that the C-terminal half of U1 70k was required for binding ASF/SF2 in a far Western assay (9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). The determinants of this binding were investigated, and here we show that the RS1 region in 70k is necessary and sufficient for binding ASF/SF2. By extension, we point out that the RS2 region is likely to have other roles in the function of U1 70k. We dissected the RS1 region and show that the segment encoded by amino acids 248–270, which we call RS1nc, was sufficient to replace the RS1 region. Moreover, we present data that indicate the importance of arginine residues within a sequence repeated in the segment Arg248–Asp270 in RS1. Several of these arginines are also critical for the phophorylation of the segment by SRPK1. Thus, the Arg248–Asp270segment in the U1 70k protein is equivalent to an RS domain. Segments of a ASF/SF2 cDNA were subcloned into the plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH) encoding the GAL4 DNA-binding domain using the EcoRI andBamHI sites. Segments of a U1 70K cDNA were subcloned into the plasmid pGAD424 (CLONTECH), which encodes the GAL4 transcription activation domain (GAL4AD), between theEcoRI and BglII sites. The constructs ASF, ASF-RS, ASF-RSn, and ASF-RSc encode for the full length, the RS domain, the N-terminal half of the RS domain of ASF/SF2, and the C-terminal half of the RS domain of ASF/SF2, respectively. ASFΔRS lacks an RS domain. Constructs U1 70K, 70K-RS1, and 70K-RS2 encode the full-length, the RS1 domain, and the RS2 domain of U1 70K protein, respectively. Δ271–437, Δ249–437, and Δ231–437 represent U1 70K constructs with deletions of amino acids 271–437, 249–437, and 231–437, respectively. RS1n and RS1c constructs encode the N-terminal segment or C-terminal segment of the RS1 region, and RS1nn and RSnc contain the N-terminal segment or the C-terminal segment of SR1n. RS1nc-mut is a derivative of RS1nc, in which Arg260 was mutated to lysine (this mutant will be designated m6). 70K-ΔRS1nc was constructed by deleting the region encoding amino acids 240–300 of U1 70K usingSmaI and ApaI restriction endonucleases (New England Inc.). Subsequently, the region encoding amino acids 271–300 was cloned back as a polymerase chain reaction product. The variants of Δ271–437 (m1 to m5) were made by cloning annealed oligonucleotides so as to extend the open reading frame in construct Δ249–437. DNA fragments encoding either 70k-SR1nc or mutant SR1nc segments m1, m3, and m7 (see Fig. 4 A) were subcloned into the pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the BamHI andEcoRI sites. These plasmids were used to overexpress GST fusion proteins as described by Sune and Garcia-Blanco (43Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides encoding a (SR)5 peptide, SRSRSRSRSR, were subcloned into pBGT9 vector in the EcoRI site. Recombinant ASF/SF2 were made as described previously (20Ge H. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Baculovirus-derived SRPK1 was a kind gift from X.-D. Fu (University of California at San Diego). The vector GST-SRPK1 was a gift from J. Fleckner (Aarhus, Denmark). GST-SRPK1 fusion protein was prepared from Escherichia coli as described in Ref. 43Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The two-hybrid interaction experiments were performed according to Fields and Song (44Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). The strain SFY526 (Mata, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, canr, gal4-542, gal80-538, URA3::GAL1-lacZ) was used as the host yeast strain for all the experiments. To assay the pairwise interactions, segments of cDNAs encoding the U1 70k protein were introduced into vector pGAD424 and that of cDNA encoding ASF/SF2 protein and (SR)5 peptide into the vector pGBT9 and in some cases also in pGAD424. The liquid β-galactosidase assay was carried out by using the yeast extracts according to Fridell et al. (45Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and was normalized using the A600 of yeast cultures. The recombinant GST-SR1nc fusion protein and the mutant GST-M1, GST-M3, and GST-M7 fusion proteins, which were encoded by plasmids with RS1nc encoding fragments designated m1, m3, and m7, respectively (see sequence in Fig. 4 A), were purified on glutathione-agarose beads as described (43Sune C. Garcia-Blanco M.A. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation reactions were carried out in 50 μl and contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and either 5 ng/μl recombinant SRPK1 or 10 μl of HeLa S100 extract, added to 20 μl of packed glutathione-agarose beads for 90 min at 30 °C. The beads were washed with 100–150 packed bead volumes, resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels. The phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Yeast lysates (equal amount for each lane) were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore Inc.) membrane for Western or nitrocellulose (GeneScreen Inc.) for far Western blot analyses using a 25 mm Tris and 192 mm glycine/20% methanol transfer buffer. Monoclonal antibody of U1 70K (46Billings P.B. Allen R.W. Jensen F.C. Hoch S.O. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1176-1180PubMed Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody mAb104 (47Roth M.B. Murphy C. Gall J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2217-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) were used for Western blot analyses. A secondary anti-mouse Ig antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase was used in ECL Western assay (American Life Science) to detect the monoclonal antibodies and was used as described by the manufacturer. In far Western assays recombinant ASF/SF2 protein was labeled with using [γ-32P]ATP and SRPK1. Labeling used 200 ng/μl ASF/SF2, 15 ng/μl SRPK1, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm ATP. The labeled ASF/SF2 protein was subsequently purified through nickel columns (Qiagen) as described in Ref. 20Ge H. Zuo P. Manley J.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 373-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar. Immediately before use, filters for far Western blots were incubated in modified buffer D containing 6 m guanidine HCl for 30 min at room temperature (48Ge H. Noble J. Colgan J. Manley J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3338-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Proteins were renatured by dilution (1:1) in buffer D for six cycles (10 min each). Filters were then rinsed twice in buffer D and blocked in buffer D containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h. Subsequently, the filters were incubated with labeled ASF/SF2 in the binding buffer containing 13 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 28 mm(NH4)2SO4, 33 mm KCl, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.13 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 12 h at 40 °C. Blots were washed three times for 20 min in binding buffer without dry milk, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. The interaction between ASF/SF2 and U1 70k protein has been shown to depend on the RS domain of ASF/SF2 (9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 38Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Moreover, the C-terminal half of 70k protein, which contains the RS1 and RS2 regions (Fig.1 A), was also shown to be required (9Kohtz J.D. Jamison S.F. Will C.L. Zuo P. Luhrmann R. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Manley J.L. Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). To characterize the sequences in U1 70k that are necessary and sufficient to bind ASF/SF2, we tested for this bindingin vivo using the two-hybrid system of Fields and Song (44Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Chimeric proteins, with segments of U1 70k protein fused to the transcriptional activation domain of GAL4 (GAL4AD), were co-expressed with chimeric proteins containing the open reading frame of ASF/SF2 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4. The relative strength of protein-protein interactions were determined by quantifying β-galactosidase activity in yeast extracts. The requirement for the RS1 and RS2 regions of the U1 70k in ASF/SF2 binding was investigated by sequentially deleting C-terminal segments of U1 70k (Fig. 1 B). Deletion of the RS2 region and the C-terminal region of the RS1 region (Δ271–437) resulted in a protein that retained significant binding to ASF/SF2 (Fig. 1 C). This deletion removes the RS2 region, which is rich in arginines and in acidic residues (Fig. 1 A) (10Query C.C. Bentley R.C. Keene J.D. Cell. 1989; 57: 89-101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). It also removes a section of the RS1 region that contains four RS dipeptides (see amino acids 276–296 in Fig. 1 A) but is devoid of runs of these RS dipeptides. Further deletion to amino acid 248 (Δ249–437), which eliminates two runs of RS dipeptides, completely abolished binding and, as expected, so did deletion to amino acid 230 (Δ231–437) (Fig.1 C). This experiment indicated that amino acids 248–270 were important for ASF/SF2 binding and suggested a modest contribution by elements within the region from amino acid 271 to the C terminus. To further characterize the sequence requirements for ASF/SF2 binding, we constructed GAL4AD fusion proteins with short segments of U1 70k (Fig. 2 A). The RS1 and the RS2 regions were tested, and only the former was capable of binding ASF/SF2 (Fig. 2 B). Although the binding of the isolated RS1 was always lower (∼70%) than the binding of the full-length U1 70k, this difference was not highly significant (TableI). The RS1 region was divided into two subregions, RS1n and RS1c (Fig. 2 A), each of which contained at least one Arg-Ser dipeptide. RS1n, which spans amino acids 230–270, bound ASF/SF2 almost as well as RS1, whereas the RS1c subregion, which encompasses residues 271–309, did not (Fig. 2 B). RS1n was divided into two segments: RS1nn, which did not contain Arg-Ser repeats, and RS1nc, which contained two RSRSR pentapeptides. Not surprisingly, the RS1nn segment did not bind ASF/SF2, whereas the RS1nc did (Fig. 2 B). This 23-amino acid-long segment, which spans residues 248–270, bound ASF/SF2 almost as well as did the RS1 region, and about half as well as full-length U1 70k protein (Fig.2 B). Thus, the segment between amino acids 248 and 270 of the U1 70k protein was sufficient for ASF/SF2 binding.Table IInteractions between regions of U1 70k protein and ASF/SF2ASF/SF2ASF-RSASF-RSnASF-RScASFΔRSU1 70k16.3 ± 6.115.4 ± 6.314.8 ± 4.611.2 ± 5.11.01 ± 0.2RS112.3 ± 4.79.3 ± 3.8NDNDNDRS20.7 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.21.1 ± 0.00.9 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.1RS1n9.9 ± 2.59.0 ± 3.19.3 ± 1.77.8 ± 2.50.9 ± 0.4RS1c1.5 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.1RS1nn0.9 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.2RS1nc8.4 ± 2.48.3 ± 1.77.2 ± 2.56.4 ± 1.81.5 ± 0.5A quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed on at least three independent experiments for each combination (45Fridell R.A.

Open table in a new tab A quantitative liquid β-galactosidase assay was performed on at least three independent experiments for each combination (45Fridell R.A. Harding L.S. Bogerd H.P. Cullen B.R. Virology. 1995; 209: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The yeast extract was normalized by A600 of the yeast cultures. The numbers shown represent the fold activation over the negative control obtained when plasmids pGBT9 and pGAD424, the parental plasmids, were tested for interactions and are expressed as the means ± S.D. All ASF/SF2 segments were cloned into pGBT9, whereas U1 70k segments were cloned in pGAD424. To determine whether or not the RS1 region was absolutely necessary for binding ASF/SF2 we constructed a plasmid encoding a GAL4AD fusion protein that contained the full length of U1 70k with a precise deletion of amino acids 240–270 (ΔRS1nc in Fig.3 A). It should be noted that the borders of this deletion are not equivalent to those of the RS1nc fragment; the deletion extends to eight residues N-terminal of the RS1nc fragment (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 3 A). Full-length U1 70k and ΔRS1nc were tested, and the deletion of amino acids 240–270 diminished binding ASF/SF2 by more than 4-fold (Fig.3 B). It is important to note that in these experiments the negative control is arbitrarily assigned a value of 1.0 (not shown), which implied that the ΔRS1nc was still able to weakly bind ASF/SF2. These data strongly suggested that the segment from 240–270 was necessary for efficient ASF/SF2 binding. The segment of U1 70k spanning amino acids 248–270, which we refer to as RS1nc (Fig. 2) and which was sufficient for ASF/SF2 binding, contains two RSRSR pentapeptides. We investigated the role of four arginines, Arg258, Arg260, Arg267, and Arg269, that occupy the positions underlined in the RSRSR pentapeptides (Figs. 1 and4 A). Arg260 was changed to Lys260 in the context of an isolated RS1nc segment in construct RS1nc-mut (Fig. 3 A). This change significantly diminished ASF/SF2 binding in the two-hybrid system compared with the RS1nc (Fig. 3 B). In this experiment the RS1nc-mut had the same low level of binding as the full-length protein with a deletion of amino acids 240–270 (ΔRS1nc). We constructed a library of variants of the clone Δ271–437 (Fig.1 B) where the aforementioned four amino acid positions could be randomly occupied by arginine or lysine. Screening for independent clones did not yield all possible mutants; nevertheless, the wild type (Δ271–437) and five mutants were obtained and analyzed. Three mutants (m2, m3, and m5) had double Arg → Lys substitutions that changed both RSRSR pentapeptides. All of these reduced ASF binding to ∼25% of the Δ271–437 (Fig. 4 B). This level of binding was clearly above that obtained with Δ249–437, a mutant missing the segment with the two pentapeptides (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that the Arg → Lys mutations crippled but did not destroy the binding domain. Mutations in the C-terminal RSRSR pentapeptide (m1 and m4) had very similar effect (Fig. 4 B). One of these, m1, was the replacement of a single arginine, Arg269, for Lys269 (Fig. 4 B), indicating that Arg269 was critical for binding. Given these results and those obtained with RS1nc-mut, it is likely that both pentapeptides play equivalent and cooperative roles and that mutation of either RSRSR pentapeptide would be detrimental. To confirm that these mutant GAL4AD proteins are expressed to equivalent levels, we measured their levels using a monocl"
https://openalex.org/W2000097800,"G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) initiate pathways leading to the desensitization of agonist-occupied G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we report that the cytoskeletal protein actin binds and inhibits GRK5. Actin inhibits the kinase activity directly, reducing GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of both membrane-bound GPCRs and soluble substrates. GRK5 binds actin monomers with a Kd of 0.6 μm and actin filaments with a Kd of 0.2 μm. Mutation of 6 amino acids near the amino terminus of GRK5 eliminates actin-mediated inhibition of GRK5. Calmodulin has previously been shown to bind to the amino terminus of GRK5 (Pronin, A. N., and Benovic, J. L. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 3806–3812) and here we show calmodulin displaces GRK5 from actin. Calmodulin inhibits GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of GPCRs, but not soluble substrates such as casein. Thus in the presence of actin, calmodulin determines the substrate specificity of GRK5 by preferentially allowing phosphorylation of soluble substrates over membrane-bound substrates. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) initiate pathways leading to the desensitization of agonist-occupied G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here we report that the cytoskeletal protein actin binds and inhibits GRK5. Actin inhibits the kinase activity directly, reducing GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of both membrane-bound GPCRs and soluble substrates.

Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319, 352-353, 351Google Scholar). The GRKs contain a highly conserved catalytic domain flanked by more divergent amino (NH2)- and carboxyl (COOH)-terminal regulatory regions. Based on sequence homology outside the catalytic domain, the GRKs are divided into three subfamilies consisting of GRK1 (Rhodopsin kinase); GRK2 (β-adrenergic receptor kinase 1) and GRK3 (β-adrenergic receptor kinase 2); and GRK4, -5, and -6. GRK1 and -4 are expressed exclusively in the retina (2Lorenz W. Inglese J. Palczewski K. Onorato J.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since GPCR desensitization ultimately results in the termination of many important signaling cascades, it is not surprising that phosphorylation of GPCRs by GRKs is highly regulated.

Initially regulation of GPCR phosphorylation focused on the agonist-induced conformational changes receptors undergo to become GRK substrates. However, recent evidence demonstrates GRK activity is regulated differentially by protein kinase C phosphorylation, calcium-binding proteins, and lipid targeting to membranes. Various lipid modifications or binding domains determine accessibility to substrates, as reviewed by Freedman et al. (1Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319, 352-353, 351Google Scholar). GRK2 and GRK5 are protein kinase C substrates. Protein kinase C phosphorylation activates GRK2 activity, while it inhibits GRK5 activity (5Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3806-3812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Additionally, calcium-calmodulin regulates the activity of GRK2 and -3 and GRK4, -5, and -6, but the affinity is 10–20-fold higher for GRK5 than GRK2 (5Pronin A.N. Benovic J.L. J. Biol.

Notably, calmodulin binding inhibits GRK-mediated GPCR phosphorylation without affecting the ability of these kinases to phosphorylate soluble (“model”) substrates. In a search for other protein regulators of GRKs, we have identified a novel interaction between GRKs and actin. Herein we characterize this interaction and compare and contrast the regulatory characteristics of actin and calmodulin on GRK5 activity. Bovine milk β-casein was purchased from Sigma. Highly purified bovine brain calmodulin was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). GRK2 and GRK5 were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 insect cells (9Kim C.M. Dion S.B. Onorato J.J. Benovic J.L. Receptor. 1993; 3: 39-55PubMed Google Scholar, 10Premont R.T. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal polybasic (NTPB and CTPB) mutants were created by polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis of lysine and arginine residues between amino acids 22–29 and 547–557, respectively, to alanines (11Pitcher J.A.

Preparations enriched for these mutant enzymes were made from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells homogenized in 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Rod outer segment membranes containing rhodopsin were prepared (12Papermaster D.S. Dreyer W.J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 2438-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) and β2-adrenergic receptor was purified from Sf9 cells and reconstituted in crude lipids (13Pitcher J.A. Touhara K.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4510-4518Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Actin was purified from rabbit skeletal back and leg muscle (15Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and gel filtered over Sephacryl S-300 (16MacLean-Fletcher S. Pollard T.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) equilibrated in Buffer A (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm NaN3, 2 mm Tris, pH 8.0) at 4 °C. The actin concentration was determined by absorbance at 290 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 2.66 × 104m−1 cm−1 (17Houk Jr., T.W. Ue K. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 62: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Actin was labeled on C374 with pyrene/iodoacetamide (18Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 1970-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), gel filtered, and used at 5% of the total actin concentration. Mg2+-actin was made from Ca2+-actin in Buffer A by adding 50–80 μmMgCl2 and 200 μm EGTA. Mg2+-actin was polymerized with 0.1 volume of 10 × KMEI (500 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) to generate a stock solution of filaments in 1 × polymerizing buffer. GRK5-binding proteins were identified using a modification of a procedure initially of Leiser et al. (19Leiser M. Rubin C.S. Erlichman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1904-1908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in samples to be probed were separated by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207516) Google Scholar) and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The nitrocellulose filters were blocked in 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 5%(w/v) non-fat dry milk, and 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h at 4 °C and subsequently washed three times with binding buffer (100 mmTris, pH 7.4, and 50 mm NaCl). GRK5-binding proteins were detected by incubating the nitrocellulose filters with purified autophosphorylated GRK5. GRK5 (3 μm) was autophosphorylated by incubation in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.0 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT containing 60 μm[γ-32P]ATP (∼6000 cpm/pmol) at 30 °C for 30 min. Prior to incubation with the nitrocellulose filters the GRK5 was desalted over G-25 columns (1 ml) to remove excess [γ-32P]ATP. The 32P-labeled GRK5 (0.2 μm) was incubated with the nitrocellulose filters in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Blots were washed five times with 500 ml of binding buffer to reduce nonspecific binding and subsequently exposed to x-ray film. Binding to actin monomers was determined from a change in the fluorescence intensity of pyrenyl-actin (λex = 365 nm, λem = 407 nm). GRK5 induces the polymerization of actin when [GRK5] ≫ [Actin] (Fig. 3) so fluorescence intensities were measured 5 s after mixing kinase and actin. Data was collected over a range of kinase concentrations and was fitted to Equation 1, FI=FIo+(FImax−FIo)×Equation 1 Kd+[A]+[GRK]−(Kd+[A]+[GRK])2−(4[A][GRK])2[A]where FIo is the fluorescence in the absence of GRK, [A] is the actin monomer concentration (0.4 μm), [GRK] is the GRK5 concentration, andKd is the dissociation equilibrium constant of the complex. Parameters determined from the fits were the amplitudes (FImax − FIo) and the Kd. Assembly of actin filaments was monitored by fluorescence of pyrene-actin (λex = 365 nm, λem = 407 nm). Depolymerization of Mg2+-actin filaments was initiated by a 30-fold dilution of a 0.5 μm stock solution of filaments (5% pyrene-labeled) in 1 × KMEI buffer containing 2 mm CaCl2 in the presence and absence of GRK. GRK induced assembly of actin monomers was measured by pyrene fluorescence after mixing actin monomers with GRK in Buffer A. GRK5 and the indicated concentration of actin were incubated with either rod outer segments containing rhodopsin, β2-adrenergic receptor (120 nm), or casein (23 μm) at 30 °C for 5, 10, or 15 min, respectively, in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 60 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼0.25 μCi/μl). For reactions examining the effect of calmodulin, the reaction also contained 2 mm CaCl2, which alone had no effect on GRK5 activity. An equal volume of sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 4% SDS, 200 mmDTT, 0.25% pyronin Y, 20% glycerol) was added to terminate the 25-μl reaction and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and the amount of phosphorylation was quantitated using Image Quant (Molecular Dynamics). GRK5 was clarified in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor (70,000 rpm; 200,000 × g) for 20 min. The supernatant was mixed with a range of actin filament concentrations and equilibrated at 22 °C for 45 min. The final conditions were 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 200 μm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm CaCl2, 600 nm GRK, and actin filament concentrations from 0 to 20 μm in the presence or absence of 1.2 μmcalmodulin. The mixture was spun at 200,000 × g for 30 min to pellet actin filaments and bound GRK5. Free GRK5 in the supernatants was precipitated with 100% methanol. An aliquot of myoglobin was included in each sample to correct for any differences in recovery from the precipitation. Extracted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by two-dimensional scanning densitometry of wet, Coomassie-stained gels. Data from scanned gels were analyzed with NIH Image. Binding constants were determined from a least squares fit to a modified form of Equation 1. To identify proteins that interact with GRK5, cellular extracts were probed with radiolabeled GRK5 using a gel-overlay technique. An abundant protein of approximately 42 kDa in the particulate (P) fraction of heart tissue interacts with GRK5 (Fig. 1). Its abundance and electrophoretic mobility suggested that it might be actin, so we confirmed that purified actin from rabbit skeletal muscle interacts with GRK5 under these denaturing conditions (Fig. 1). Both GRK5 and GRK2 bind actin monomers in solution. GRKs enhance the fluorescence of the pyrene-labeled actin monomers suggesting that they bind near the COOH terminus of actin near the site of fluorophore attachment (C374). GRK5 binds with a Kd of 0.62 (± 0.07) μm (Fig.2 A), while the affinity of GRK2 is approximately 10-fold lower, Kd = 5.6 μm (data not shown). Both GRK2 and GRK5 cosediment with actin filaments. The equilibrium binding affinity of GRK5 for actin filaments in physiological salt is 0.2 ± 0.1 μm (Fig. 2 B). As with actin monomers, GRK2 binds with a 10-fold lower affinity (Kd = 2.9 μm). GRK5 binding to pyrene-labeled actin filaments quenches the fluorescence by >50% (data not shown). The affinity determined from pyrene fluorescence was similar to the sedimentation assay (Kd = 0.18 ± 0.13 μm). These results indicate that GRK5 binds actin filaments as well as actin monomers, with an affinity that is similar to other actin-binding proteins (21Pollard T.D. Cooper J.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 987-1035Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the affinity of GRK2 is lower. For the remainder of these studies we focused on the higher affinity interaction between actin and GRK5. At substoichiometric concentrations, GRK5 does not affect the critical concentration of actin filament assembly (data not shown), demonstrating that GRKs do not sequester monomers and prevent their incorporation into filaments. Saturating concentrations of GRK5 inhibit the depolymerization of actin filaments upon dilution (Fig.3 A), demonstrating that GRK5 binding does not sever filaments, but stabilizes their structure. In addition, GRK5 induces the assembly of monomers under non-polymerizing conditions, presumably by stabilizing the formation of oligomers; in contrast, GRK2 has no effect on actin assembly (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results suggest that GRK5 binds at least two actin monomers, thereby stabilizing the intersubunit contacts and inhibiting depolymerization from filament ends. Similar effects result from tropomyosin and myosin-binding actin (22Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9182-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Cooper J.A. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). GRK5 phosphorylates agonist-occupied GPCRs, the only physiological substrates identified for these kinases. Although no physiological soluble substrates are known for GRK5, casein is an in vitromodel substrate for GRKs. Actin binding to GRK5 inhibits GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of membrane bound (rhodopsin and β2-adrenergic receptor) and soluble (casein) substrates with similar IC50 values, between 1.5 and 3 μm (Fig.4). These IC50 values are consistent, within experimental error, with the binding affinities reported above (Fig. 2). The inhibition by actin differs from the action of calmodulin, another known inhibitor. Calmodulin physically inhibits GRK5 phosphorylation of membrane-bound substrates by preventing association with phospholipids and receptor substrates (24Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) but does not inhibit casein phosphorylation. To determine if either of the polybasic regions at the extreme NH2 terminus and COOH terminus of GRK5 interact with actin, we examined mutants with mutations of basic amino acids at the NTPB or CTPB of GRK5 (shown in Fig.5 A). In five independent experiments performed in duplicate, 2.2 μm actin inhibited CTPB-mediated casein phosphorylation by 40% but NTPB-mediated casein phosphorylation by only 6% (Fig. 5 B). Actin-mediated inhibition of CTPB is similar to that observed using purified wild-type GRK5 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that the amino terminus of GRK5, and specifically basic residues located in this region (Fig. 5 A), bind actin. The polybasic region of NTPB that is required for inhibition by actin overlaps the calmodulin-binding site of GRK5 previously localized between residues 20 and 39 (24Pronin A.N. Satpaev D.K. Slepak V.Z. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18273-18280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). To determine if calmodulin alters actin inhibition of GRK5-mediated phosphorylation, we assayed casein and rhodopsin phosphorylation in the presence of inhibiting concentrations of actin and increasing concentrations of calcium-calmodulin. CaCl2 itself has no effect on GRK5-mediated phosphorylation (data not shown). Calmodulin specifically inhibits GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of membrane substrates (6Chuang T.T. Paolucci L. De Blasi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28691-28696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), whereas actin inhibits GRK5-mediated phosphorylation of both rhodopsin and casein, membrane and soluble substrates (Fig. 4). Interestingly, calcium-calmodulin reverses the inhibitory effect of actin on casein phosphorylation (Fig. 6, filled bars), consistent with these two regulators binding to similar sites on GRK5. Calmodulin did not rescue receptor phosphorylation activity in the presence of actin (Fig. 6, open bars), suggesting that calmodulin dissociates GRK5 from actin to form a GRK5·calmodulin complex competent to phosphorylate soluble substrates, but incapable of phosphorylating receptor substrates. Both the ability of calmodulin to reverse the actin-mediated inhibition of GRK5 and the apparently coincident binding sites of actin and calmodulin suggests that calmodulin disrupts the physical interaction between GRK5 and actin filaments. Indeed, in two experiments similar to Fig. 2 B, 2 μm actin filaments bound 570 (±9.5) nm of 600 nm GRK5 in the absence of calmodulin and only 309 (±62) nm GRK5 with 1.2 μm calmodulin. In addition, calmodulin eliminates the effects of GRK5 on actin polymerization and depolymerization shown in Fig. 3, resulting in traces superimposable with the actin alone trace (data not shown). We identify actin as a 42-kDa protein that interacts with GRK5. This high affinity interaction between GRK5 and actin manifests itself in the ability of actin to inhibit GRK5-mediated kinase activity. Actin inhibits the phosphorylation of soluble substrates as well as membrane-bound substrates. Interestingly, point mutations within the calmodulin-binding domain of GRK5 prevent inhibition by actin. These apparently overlapping binding sites allow calmodulin to displace GRK5 from actin filaments and to increase GRK5 activity toward soluble substrates in the presence of actin. Actin is a very abundant cellular protein and is a major component of the microfilament network that is essential for many cellular processes including cell division, tension, movement, and signal transduction. Most known proteins associated with microfilaments assist in the organization and reorganization of the cytoskeleton. In vitro, GRK5 stabilizes filaments, but given the low cellular concentration of GRK5 we would not predict any effects on actin polymerization overall, although GRK5 could stabilize filaments near membranes where it is localized. Few actin-associated proteins are reported to have enzymatic activities that are directly inhibited by actin. One enzyme known to associate with the cytoskeleton that is inhibited by actin is casein kinase II (25Karino A. Tanoue S. Fukuda M. Nakamura T. Ohtsuki K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 317-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Casein kinase II has some similarities to GRK5 including the ability to phosphorylate casein and the ability to be inhibited by heparin (26Kunapuli P. Benovic J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5588-5592Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The glycolytic enzyme aldolase is also regulated by actin binding. In this case, the substrate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, inhibits aldolase binding to actin (27Arnold H. Pette D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 15: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 28Walsh T.P. Clarke F.M. Masters C.J. Biochem. J. 1977; 165: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that the actin bound enzyme is in its resting state. These two examples support the suggestion that actin provides more than a means of statically localizing proteins, but plays a more dynamic role by specifically regulating enzymatic activity. Intracellular localization is an important means of regulating GRK activity. GRK1, -2, and -3 are present in the cytosol in resting cells, and only when cells are exposed to agonist, translocate to membranes to phosphorylate their receptor substrates. GRK4, -5, and -6, on the other hand, are located in the particulate fraction which contains both GPCRs and actin. Actin inhibition of GRK5-mediated phosphorylation suggests a mechanism by which GRK5 is simultaneously localized to the cytoskeleton and prevented from desensitizing its receptor substrate. Given the overlapping binding sites of actin and calmodulin, we propose that these proteins act in concert to regulate GRK5 catalytic activity. Interestingly, MARCKS also binds calmodulin and actin. Hartwig et al. (29Hartwig J.H. Thelen M. Rosen A. Janmey P.A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Nature. 1992; 356: 618-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar) demonstrate that calmodulin prevents the actin filament bundling ability of a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 155–173 of MARCKS. In addition, the association of caldesmon (30Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5652-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and dystrophin (31Jarrett H.W. Foster J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5578-5586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) with actin is reduced by calcium-calmodulin. Thus, GRK5 is similar to a number of other proteins that are displaced from actin by calmodulin. The data reported here in an in vitro model system support the following model for GRK5 activation. A rise in the intracellular levels of calcium following agonist occupancy would activate calmodulin and displace the kinase-inhibited GRK5 from actin. This calmodulin bound GRK5 is capable of phosphorylating soluble substrates in vitro, suggesting the possibility that GRK5 could then phosphorylate non-receptor soluble substrates in vivo. Although there are, as yet, no known such endogenous soluble substrates for GRK5, Pitcher et al. (32Pitcher J.A. Hall R.A. Daaka Y. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Hester S. Miller S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Barak L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12316-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) have recently identified tubulin as a soluble substrate for GRK2. Previous evidence demonstrating that agonist-occupied receptors increase GRK phosphorylation of peptide substrates (33Palczewski K. Buczylko J. Kaplan M.W. Polans A.S. Crabb J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12949-12955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Brown N.G. Fowles C. Sharma R. Akhtar M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 840PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chen C.Y. Dion S.B. Kim C.M. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7825-7831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also support the possibility that endogenous substrates could be phosphorylated following agonist stimulation of GPCR activation of GRKs. Previous work has focused on the inhibition of GRK5 by calmodulin, however, this inhibition extends only to membrane-bound receptor substrates. In contrast, actin is a direct inhibitor of GRK5, inhibiting both membrane-bound and soluble substrates. Since actin and calmodulin both interact with the NH2 terminus of GRK5, we propose that the dynamic regulation of GRK5 by these two proteins could serve as a calcium-mediated mechanism to modulate the kinase specificity of GRK5 for either membrane or soluble substrates.

After vessel wall injury, smooth muscle cells are transformed from a contractile, quiescent phenotype to a proliferative, migratory phenotype that secretes abundant extracellular matrix (1Raines E.W. Ross R. Br. Heart J. 1993; 69: S30-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle cells are subject to complex regulation by soluble extracellular signals provided by growth factors, cytokines, and vasoactive agents as well as cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (1Raines E.W. Ross R. Br. Heart J. 1993; 69: S30-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Therefore, factors controlling smooth muscle cell behavior, including migration, proliferation, and lipid metabolism, are critical to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Cell surface signal transduction and adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (2O'Brien K.D. Allen M.D. McDonald T.O. Chait A. Harlan J.M. Fishbein D. McCarthy J. Ferguson M. Hudkins K. Benjamin C.D. Lobb R. Alpers C.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) and the β1 and β3 integrins (3Clyman R.I. Mauray F. Kramer R.H. Exp.

Pathol. 1994; 145: 1070-1081PubMed Google Scholar) have been implicated in the modulation of smooth muscle cell function. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that the proteoglycan CD44 may also mediate vascular smooth muscle cell activation during vascular remodeling (5Jain M. He Q. Lee W.-S. Kashiki S.

The CD44 transmembrane glycoprotein exists in a variety of isoforms generated by alternative splicing of one (or more) of 10 variable exons in the extracellular domain (6Screaton G.R. Bell M.V.

The importance of CD44 in vivo has also been demonstrated in a mouse model in which an antisense CD44 transgene is expressed selectively under the control of a keratinocyte-specific promoter (21Kaya G. Rodriguez I. Jorcano J.L. Vassalli P. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 996-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Suppression of CD44 expression inhibits keratinocyte proliferation and results in abnormal hyaluronate metabolism in the skin. Moreover, CD44 is induced on smooth muscle cells after vascular injury, and it may mediate the proliferative effects of hyaluronate (5Jain M. He Q. Lee W.-S. Kashiki S. Foster L.C. Tsai J.-C. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has developed a mouse model of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis in which a carotid artery loop is transplanted between inbred strains in syngeneic and allogeneic combinations (22Shi C. Russell M.E. Bianchi C. Newell J. Haber E. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Lesion development depends on an acquired immune response and begins with infiltration of inflammatory cells, after which follows accumulation of smooth muscle cells in the neointima (23Shi C.

In the present study we evaluated CD44 cell surface protein expression in vivoduring the pathogenesis of transplant arteriosclerosis in order to understand the role of CD44 in modulating vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating CD44 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells after injury, we studied the effect of interleukin (IL) 1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinRASMCrat aortic smooth muscle cellsPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenPBSphosphate-buffered salineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase(s).1The abbreviations used are: ILinterleukinRASMCrat aortic smooth muscle cellsPCNAproliferating cell nuclear antigenPBSphosphate-buffered salineCATchloramphenicol acetyltransferasekbkilobase(s). 1β on CD44 gene expression in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). interleukin rat aortic smooth muscle cells proliferating cell nuclear antigen phosphate-buffered saline chloramphenicol acetyltransferase kilobase(s). interleukin rat aortic smooth muscle cells proliferating cell nuclear antigen phosphate-buffered saline chloramphenicol acetyltransferase kilobase(s). Carotid artery transplantation was performed as described (22Shi C. Russell M.E. Bianchi C. Newell J. Haber E. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In brief, a carotid artery loop was transplanted between two strains of inbred mice incompatible in the H-2 region. B.10A(2R) (H-2h2) mice were used as donors in the allograft group, and C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice were used as donors in the isograft group. C57BL/6J (H-2b) mice were used as recipients in both groups. Transplant samples were prepared and immunostained as described by Shi et al. (22Shi C. Russell M.E. Bianchi C. Newell J. Haber E. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Grafts were harvested and processed in methyl Carnoy's fixative, embedded in paraffin, and cut in a microtome in 4-μm cross-sections. After removal of the paraffin, tissue sections were incubated with 10% normal serum for 20 min at room temperature. Immunohistochemical analysis for CD44 was carried out with a rat anti-mouse CD44 monoclonal antibody (IM7, rat IgG2b, 1 μg/ml; PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Proliferating cells were detected with a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (clone PC10, 3 μg/ml; Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA), and vascular smooth muscle cells with an anti-smooth muscle actin monoclonal antibody (anti-NH2-terminal decapeptide, clone 1A4, 1:400; Sigma). Tissue samples were incubated with the antibodies at room temperature for 1 h and then at 4 °C overnight. Biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (1:100, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used as a secondary antibody to detect CD44 staining, and biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibody (RPN 1181, 1:100, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as a secondary antibody to detect PCNA and α-actin staining. Sections stained for CD44 and PCNA were labeled with avidin-biotin enzyme complex peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) and developed in 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Sections stained for α-actin were labeled with avidin-biotin enzyme complex alkaline phosphatase and developed with VectorRed (Vector Laboratories). Sections treated for CD44 and PCNA were counterstained with 1% methyl green, and sections treated for α-actin were counterstained with Verhoeff's stain for elastic tissue. RASMC were harvested from the thoracic aorta of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g) by enzymatic dissociation according to the method of Gunther et al. (24Gunther S. Alexander R.W. Atkinson W.J. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS) and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). RASMC were passaged every 4–7 days, and experiments were performed on cells four to seven passages from primary culture. Recombinant IL-1β and platelet-derived growth factor-BB were obtained from Collaborative Biomedical (Bedford, MA). Tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Cultured RASMC were treated with vehicle or IL-1β (10 ng/ml), harvested with 0.05% trypsin/0.2 mm EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), washed, and resuspended in 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells (106) were incubated with antibody OX49 (anti-rat CD44, IgG2a; PharMingen) or mouse IgG2a negative control antibody (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeled cells were washed twice with 0.2% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (goat F(ab)′ anti-mouse IgG; Biosource International). Flow cytometry analysis was performed on an Ortho 2150 cytofluorograph (Cyonics/Uniphase, Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a Cyclops data acquisition and analysis system (Cyclops Software, Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Total RNA was obtained from cultured cells by guanidinium isothiocyanate extraction and centrifuged through cesium chloride (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated on a 1.3% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were hybridized with a random primed, 32P-labeled rat CD44 cDNA probe as described (5Jain M. He Q. Lee W.-S. Kashiki S. Foster L.C. Tsai J.-C. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The hybridized filters were autoradiographed with Kodak XAR film at −80 °C or stored on Phosphor screens. To correct for differences in RNA loading, the RNA filters were rehybridized with an 18-s oligonucleotide probe. The filters were scanned, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Confluent RASMC were either treated with PBS (control) or stimulated with IL-1β for 8 h. The cells were then lysed, and nuclei were isolated as described (26Perrella M.A. Yoshizumi M. Fen Z. Tsai J.-C. Hsieh C.-M. Kourembanas S. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14595-14600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The nuclear suspension (200 μl) was incubated with a 0.5 mmconcentration each of CTP, ATP, and GTP and with 125 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products). The samples were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated, and resuspended at equal counts/min/ml in hybridization buffer (1.4 × 106 cpm/ml). Denatured probes (1 μg) dot-blotted on nitrocellulose filters were hybridized at 40 °C for 4 days in the presence of formamide. cDNAs for the CD44 and β-actin genes were used as probes. The filters were scanned, and radioactivity was measured on a PhosphorImager running the ImageQuant software. The amount of sample hybridizing the CD44 probe was divided by that hybridizing the β-actin probe, and the corrected density was recorded as a percentage increase from the control density. A fragment of the 5′-flanking region of the mouse gene encoding CD44 was amplified by using the PromoterFinder Kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Primers were designed according to the published mouse CD44 sequence (27Nottenberg C. Rees G. St. John T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8521-8525Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 28Zhou D.F. Ding J.F. Picker L.J. Bzrgatze R.F. Butcher E.C. Goeddel D.V. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3390-3395PubMed Google Scholar). A CD44-specific primer (5′-GCAAGAGGCAAAGTCCCCAAGCTGT-3′) and a nested primer (5′-CCAAGCTGTGTGCCACCAAAACTTG-3′) were used in the primary and secondary polymerase chain reactions, respectively, to amplify a 1,400-base pair fragment from mouse genomic DNA. The polymerase chain reaction fragment was subcloned and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with Sequenase 2.0 DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A fragment of the mouse CD44 5′-flanking sequence was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP and used to screen a phage library of mouse genomic DNA in the λFixII vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described (29Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Hybridizing clones were isolated and purified, and phage DNA was prepared according to standard procedures (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction fragments derived from the mouse CD44 genomic phage clones were subcloned into pSP72 (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced with Thermo Sequenase DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sequence analysis was performed with the GCG software package (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). Primer extension analysis to map the transcription start site of the mouse CD44 gene was performed as described (29Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A synthetic oligonucleotide primer (5′-AAGGGCAACGAGGGTGAATGG-3′) complementary to the 5′-flanking sequence of the mouse CD44 cDNA was end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and hybridized to 50 μg of total RNA, which was then subjected to reverse transcription using avian myeloblastosis virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega). Extension products were analyzed by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. C2C12 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). S49 cells were the gift of Dr. Jayne Lesley (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid pGL2-Basic contained the firefly luciferase gene with no promoter (Promega), and phagemid pOPRSVI-CAT (Stratagene) contained the prokaryotic chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene driven by the RSV-LTR (Rous sarcoma virus-long terminal repeat) promoter. Reporter constructs containing fragments of the mouse CD44 5′-flanking sequence were named according to the location of the fragment from the transcription start site in the 5′ and 3′ directions. A gene fragment amplified from mouse genomic DNA containing 1,262 base pairs of the CD44 5′-flanking sequence upstream and 109 base pairs downstream of the transcription initiation site was cloned into pGL2-Basic and named CD44 (−1.3/+0.1 kb). A larger fragment containing approximately 3,900 base pairs upstream and 109 base pairs downstream of the CD44 transcription initiation site was cloned into pGL2-Basic and named CD44 (−3.9/+0.1 kb). All of the above constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction withPfu polymerase (Stratagene) and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method to confirm the identity and orientation of the insert. RASMC were transfected by a DEAE-dextran method (30Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were plated onto 100-mm tissue culture dishes and allowed to grow for 48–72 h (until 80–90% confluent). Luciferase plasmid DNA and pOPRSVI-CAT (to correct for differences in transfection efficiency) were added (5 μg each) to RASMC in a solution containing 500 μg/ml of DEAE-dextran. RASMC were then shocked with a 5% dimethyl sulfoxide solution for 1 min and allowed to recover in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. 12 h after transfection, RASMC were placed in 2% fetal calf serum and stimulated with vehicle (PBS) or IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Cell extracts were prepared by a detergent lysis method (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured in duplicate for all samples by using the Promega luciferase assay system and an EG&G AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Gaithersburg, MD). The CAT assay was performed by a modified two-phase fluor diffusion method as described (30Perrella M.A. Patterson C. Tan L. Yet S.-F. Hsieh C.-M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13776-13780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ratio of luciferase activity to CAT activity in each sample served as a measure of normalized luciferase activity. Each construct was transfected at least five times, and data for each construct are presented as the mean ± S.E. Relative luciferase activity in groups treated with vehicle was compared with that in groups treated with IL-1β by analysis of variance. Statistical significance was accepted at p < 0.05. To understand how CD44 may modulate vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype during vascular remodeling, we studied CD44 expression in a mouse model of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed on histological sections from allografted (Fig.1, left) and isografted (Fig.1, right) carotid arteries harvested at day 15 after transplantation, a time at which neointimal thickening is substantial (22Shi C. Russell M.E. Bianchi C. Newell J. Haber E. Circ. Res. 1994; 75: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Allograft sections displayed robust CD44 protein expression in the neointima (Fig. 1 A, brown), whereas isografted sections showed minimal CD44 expression and little neointima formation (Fig. 1 B). The level of proliferation among neointimal cells, as evidenced by staining for PCNA (Fig.1 C, brown), was significant in allograft sections. PCNA staining was absent in the isograft control (Fig.1 D). Note that CD44 and PCNA exhibited a similar pattern of induction in the neointima in day 15 allografted arteries. Vascular smooth muscle cells predominated in the neointima, as evidenced by staining for smooth muscle α-actin (Fig. 1 E,pink). Taken together, these data suggest that proliferating vascular smooth muscle cells account for the majority of CD44 expression in the neointima during the development of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis. To investigate signals regulating CD44 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, we tested the effect of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β on CD44 protein and mRNA levels. RASMC were cultured in 0.4% fetal calf serum and treated with IL-1β (10 ng/ml) for 48 h. Cell surface CD44 expression was then assessed by antibody staining and flow cytometry. CD44 surface antigen was present on RASMC under basal conditions (Fig. 2, Control) and increased by 5.3-fold after IL-1β stimulation. We then performed Northern blot analysis with total RNA from RASMC treated with vehicle (PBS) or IL-1β and hybridized with a rat CD44 cDNA probe. The CD44 mRNA hybridization pattern (Fig.3, A and B) showed four distinct bands at 1.6 kilobases (kb), 2.0 kb, 3.3 kb, and 4.5 kb, sizes similar to those reported previously for CD44 (5Jain M. He Q. Lee W.-S. Kashiki S. Foster L.C. Tsai J.-C. Lee M.-E. Haber E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These isoforms are thought to arise from alternative splicing of variant exons or from the use of multiple polyadenylation signals. In the representative Northern blot of the time course of CD44 mRNA induction (Fig.3 A), an IL-1β dose of 10 ng/ml increased CD44 mRNA as early as 6 h after stimulation. CD44 mRNA induction reached 6.6-fold after 48 h. In addition, a dose-dependent induction of CD44 mRNA was observed in RASMC stimulated for 24 h with various doses of IL-1β (Fig. 3 B). An increase in CD44 mRNA levels was evident at an IL-1β dose of as little as 1 ng/ml, and maximal up-regulation occurred at a dose of 10 ng/ml. (On the basis of these experiments, an IL-1β dose of 10 ng/ml was used in all subsequent experiments.) The ability of IL-1β to increase the level of CD44 mRNA was retained in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitors cyclohexamide and anisomycin, indicating that up-regulation was independent of de novo protein synthesis (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the cytokine IL-1β acts as a potent stimulus to induce CD44 protein and mRNA expression in RASMC. To assess the specificity of the effect of IL-1β on CD44 gene regulation, we tested the ability of other cytokines and growth factors implicated in the development of arteriosclerotic lesions to modulate CD44 mRNA expression. Serum-starved RASMC were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, and platelet-derived growth factor-BB for various lengths of time, and the CD44 message was measured by Northern analysis (Fig.4). Tumor necrosis factor-α, an inflammatory cytokine whose effects are often similar to those of IL-1β, promoted a gradual increase in CD44 mRNA which reached 3.7-fold at 48 h. Interferon-γ, which inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth (31Hansson G.K. Holm J. Circulation. 1991; 84: 1266-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 32Warner S.J. Friedman G.B. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1174-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) yet stimulates macrophage (33Pace J.L. Russell S.W. Torres B.A. Johnson H.M. Gray P.W. J. Immunol. 1983; 130: 2011-2013PubMed Google Scholar) and lymphocyte (34Sidman C.L. Marshall J.D. Shultz L.D. Gray P.W. Johnson H.M. Nature. 1984; 309: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 35Leibson H.J. Gefter M. Zlotnik A. Marrack P. Kappler J.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 799-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) activation, had only a minimal effect on CD44 message levels. Platelet-derived growth factor-BB, a potent mitogenic and chemotactic agent for smooth muscle cells, produced a 3.5-fold induction of CD44 mRNA at 4 h which returned to base line by 12 h. In light of this experiment, we concentrated our efforts on IL-1β, which produced a dramatic and sustained induction of CD44 in vascular smooth muscle cells. To elucidate the mechanism by which IL-1β elevates CD44 message levels, we performed nuclear run-on experiments to assess the effect of IL-1β on the rate of CD44 gene transcription. CD44 mRNA transcription in RASMC increased by 3.7-fold within 8 h of IL-1β stimulation compared with control (Fig. 5). Exposure of RASMC to IL-1β did not significantly prolong the half-life of CD44 mRNA in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D, which was approximately 48 h (data not shown). To investigate further the transcriptional mechanisms regulating the expression of CD44 in vascular smooth muscle cells, we cloned the 5′-regulatory sequences of the mouse CD44 gene. We used sequence information derived from a fragment of the mouse CD44 gene isolated with the PromoterFinder Kit (CLONTECH) to amplify a 1.4-kb fragment of CD44 5′-flanking sequence from mouse genomic DNA. Fig. 6 A shows the nucleotide sequence of the mouse CD44 promoter. We then identified the transcription start site of the mouse CD44 gene by primer extension analysis. A complementary oligonucleotide probe corresponding to CD44 positions +36 to +56 (Fig. 6 A,underlined with arrow) was used to prime gene transcription on total RNA from C2C12 skeletal myoblasts and the CD44-negative cell line S49. Transcription was initiated only in C2C12 cells, from a single predominant transcription start site (Fig.6 A, bent arrow) corresponding to a C nucleotide located 112 base pairs upstream of the site of translation initiation (Fig. 6 A, double underline). Identical primer extension results were obtained with total RNA from mouse aortic smooth muscle cells (data not shown) and were confirmed with an alternate CD44-specific primer (positions +115 to +139). This transcription initiation site identified by primer extension studies was consistent with results obtained by ribonuclease protection analysis (data not shown). Although the CD44 upstream sequences lack a TATA box, a binding site for transcription factor IID (Fig. 6 A, position −51) sufficient for activation of transcription through an initiator element is present (36Smale S.T. Schmidt M.C. Berk A.J. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4509-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). A comparison of the mouse CD44 5′-regulatory sequences with sequences in the Transcription Factor Data base revealed a variety of cis-acting elements, including multiple SP1 and PEA3 sites as well as a CACCC motif, a GATA site, and a cyclic AMP response element (Fig. 6 A). Sequence analysis also identified an AP1 site at position −110 which is spatially conserved in the human CD44 promoter (13Hofmann M. Rudy W. Gunthert U. Zimmer S.G. Zawadzki V. Zoller M. Lichtner R.B. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1516-1521PubMed Google Scholar). We constructed luciferase reporter plasmids driven by 1.4-kb and 4.0-kb fragments of the CD44 5′-flanking sequence to analyze CD44 promoter function in RASMC. Promoter constructs in pGL2-Basic were cotransfected into RASMC with pOPRSVI-CAT, and corrected luciferase activity was expressed as a percentage of activity in unstimulated controls. The promoter activity of plasmid CD44 (−1.3/+0.1 kb) increased by 3.5-fold upon stimulation with IL-1β (Fig. 7). Similarly, IL-1β treatment produced a 2.8-fold increase in the activity of plasmid CD44 (−3.9/+0.1 kb), which contains additional upstream regulatory sequences. These data suggest that the most important IL-1β regulatory elements are contained in the −1.3 to +0.1 kb fragment of the CD44 5′-flanking sequence. The −1.3 to +0.1 kb fragment cloned into pGL2-Basic in the antisense orientation had only minimal luciferase activity that was not altered by treatment with IL-1β (data not shown). In conjunction with the nuclear run-on experiments, these experiments demonstrate that the induction of CD44 mRNA by IL-1β is due to a transcriptional regulatory mechanism. In a variety of cell systems, functions have been proposed for CD44 in cellular activation and movement, processes that are central to the smooth muscle cell response to arterial wall injury. In our mouse model of transplant-associated arteriosclerosis, CD44 is expressed minimally in the medial layer of the normal vascular wall in vivo and is induced markedly on smooth muscle cells in the neointima of allografted carotid arteries. In addition, extracellular matrix ligands for CD44, including hyaluronate and osteopontin, are elaborated in developing atherosclerotic lesions and may be important in modulating vascular smooth muscle cell function (5Jain M.

The coincident expression of the CD44 adhesion receptor and its ligands may facilitate biological processes such as smooth muscle cell replication and migration during vascular remodeling. Although CD44 expression has been documented in a variety of cell types, little is known about the molecular regulation of the CD44 gene. CD44 transcription is up-regulated in ras-transformed rat embryonic fibroblasts in an AP-1-dependent fashion, and expression correlates with cellular metastatic potential (13Hofmann M. Rudy W. Gunthert U. Zimmer S.G. Zawadzki V. Zoller M. Lichtner R.B. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 1516-1521PubMed Google Scholar). Epidermal growth factor acts through a novel cis-acting element to induce CD44 expression in mouse fibroblasts, which is accompanied by enhanced cell attachment to hyaluronic acid (39Zhang M. Wang M.H. Singh R.K. Wells A. Siegal G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14139-14146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In the context of lymphocyte activation during humoral immune responses, the CD44 promoter is activated by the EGR1 transcription factor after B cell antigen receptor stimulation (40Maltzman J.S. Carman J.A. Monroe J.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2283-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Our present studies give new insight into the mechanisms by which cytokines regulate CD44 gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. Cytokines and growth factors regulate cellular functions that are central to atherogenesis, including proliferation, chemotaxis, lipid metabolism, and synthesis of extracellular matrix components (1Raines E.W. Ross R. Br. Heart J. 1993; 69: S30-S37Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 41Nilsson J. Cardiovasc. Res. 1993; 27: 1184-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The proinflammatory cytokine IL-1β is present in arteriosclerotic lesions and mediates changes in cellular gene expression which correlate with the development of pathological smooth muscle cell behavior (42Moyer C.F. Sajuthi D. Tulli H. Williams J.K. Am. J. Pathol. 1991; 138: 951-960PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1β is mitogenic for vascular smooth muscle cellsin vitro (43Porreca E. Di Febbo C. Barbacane R.C.

We demonstrate here that stimulation of primary cultured RASMC with IL-1β induced CD44 protein and mRNA, which was attributable to an increase in the rate of CD44 gene transcription. Transient transfection experiments in RASMC showed that induction by IL-1β was mediated by regulatory sequences that reside within a 1.4-kb fragment of the mouse CD44 promoter. We propose that IL-1β induction of CD44 gene expression contributes to a coordinated response of smooth muscle cells to arterial wall injury. Thus, further insight into the transcriptional control of the CD44 promoter may elucidate regulatory mechanisms that modulate smooth muscle cell phenotype in the pathogenesis of vascular disease.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of PIR1, a novel member in the dual-specificity phosphatase subfamily of the protein tyrosine phosphatases. PIR1 also contains two stretches of arginine-rich sequences. We have shown that the recombinant PIR1 protein possessed an intrinsic phosphatase activity on phosphotyrosine-containing substrate. A unique feature of this phosphatase is that it binds directly to RNAin vitro with high affinity. In addition, we have found that PIR1 interacted with splicing factors 9G8 and SRp30C, possibly through an RNA intermediate during a yeast two-hybrid screen. PIR1 exhibited a nuclear-staining pattern that was sensitive to RNase A, but not to DNase I, suggesting that PIR1 in the cells are associated with RNA and/or ribonucleoprotein particles. Furthermore, a fraction of PIR1 showed a speckle-staining pattern that superimposed with that of the splicing factor, SC35. Taken together, our data suggest that PIR1 is a novel phosphatase that may participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism.

Protein tyrosine phosphatases, in conjunction with protein tyrosine kinases, regulate the levels of protein tyrosine phosphorylation important for cell growth, differentiation, or transformation (1Sun H. Tonks N.K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 480-485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 2Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell.

Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell. Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Both classic PTPs and dual-specificity phosphatases contain a conserved signature motif (HCXXGXXRXG), which constitutes the active site in the phosphatase catalytic domain (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The conserved cysteinyl residue in this motif is required for the formation of a thiophosphate intermediate during the phosphate transfer reaction (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) ribonucleoprotein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. protein tyrosine phosphatase(s) ribonucleoprotein polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild type glutathione S-transferase 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. Dual-specificity phosphatases, a subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases, play important roles in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, and tumor suppression. Although dual-specificity phosphatases contain little primary sequence homology to classic PTPs, they share a similar structural folding, especially at the catalytic site, with classic PTPs (3Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Some members of this subfamily of enzymes have been shown to be able to dephosphorylate both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine. One well known member of the dual-specificity phosphatases is MKP-1/CL100, a highly selective phosphatase that dephosphorylates and inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases (4Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 5Alessi D.R. Smythe C. Keyse S.M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2015-2020PubMed Google Scholar). Another example is Cdc25 (6Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A. Cell. 1991; 67: 189-196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), which dephosphorylates the inhibitory phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine residues in Cdc2, a cyclin-dependent kinase required for G2 to M phase transition during cell cycle progression.

Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel phosphatase that structurally belongs to the dual-specificity phosphatase subfamily. Interestingly, this novel enzyme can bind to RNA in vitro, and associate with RNA and/or ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes in vivo. We have therefore named this novel enzyme PIR1, as phosphatase that interacts withRNA/RNP complex 1. The ML1 λZAPII cDNA library (9Li D.-M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar) was screened using the EST clone H60626 as a probe. Twenty positive clones were identified and excised with ExAssist helper phage (Stratagene). By restriction mapping, clone 14 was shown to contain the longest insert. This clone was subjected to DNA sequencing on both strands. The region containing the putative open reading frame was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a BamHI site added at the ends of both primers. The 1-kilobase BamHI fragment was subcloned into pCGT (11Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), pGBT9 (CLONTECH), and pAcG1 (PharMingen) and sequenced again. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to change cysteine 152 to serine (C → S) using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The presence of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. T epitope-tagged PIR1 or PIR1(CS) was amplified from pCGT-PIR1 or pCGT-PIR1(CS) template by PCR withBglII linker added at the ends of the primers and subcloned into pVL1393 (PharMingen). Cells culture and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (9Li D.-M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, cell lysates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-T epitope antibody (Novagen) and 9E10 (Oncogene) were applied in TTBS (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat milk. Blots were then washed extensively with TTBS and then incubated with appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The immunoreactive proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; NEN Life Science Products). Recombinant baculoviruses were obtained by cotransfecting plasmid pVL1393-T-PIR1 (WT or CS), pAcG1-PIR1 (WT or CS) or pAcG1-MKP1-myc with linear baculovirus DNA (PharMingen) into Sf9 cells according to the standard protocol of PharMingen. Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses. 72 h post-infection, cells were harvested, resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine) and lysed by Dounce homogenization. Lysates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min to remove the insoluble cell debris. The supernatant was then supplemented with either 100 mm KCl (for single-stranded DNA binding assay) or 140 mm KCl (for phosphatase activity assay) and 0.1% Tween 20. The clarified Sf9 cell lysates containing glutathioneS-transferase(GST)-PIR1 or GST-PIR1(CS) fusion protein (1 ml) were incubated with 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 2 h incubation at 4 °C, beads were collected and washed extensively with buffer A plus 140 mm KCl, and then assayed for phosphatase activity using phosphotyrosyl-containing poly(Glu4Tyr1) as substrate. Poly(Glu4Tyr1) (Sigma) was phosphorylated with the kinase domain of the insulin receptor (BIRK), and the protein tyrosine phosphatase activity assays were carried out as described previously (9Li D.-M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar). Cell extracts (400 μl) were incubated with 150 μl single-stranded DNA agarose (Life Technologies, Inc.) in buffer B (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Tween 20, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmbenzamidine) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of buffer B, and the proteins were then eluted sequentially with 400 μl each of 0.25 m, 0.5 m, 1m NaCl in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4). The proteins retained on the beads after 1 m NaCl elution were released by boiling in 800 μl of Laemmli sample buffer. Equal volumes of input, flow-through, eluates at different salts, and bound proteins at 1 m salt were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Baculovirus-expressed GST-PIR1 (WT or CS) or GST-MKP-1 were affinity purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads as described above. The bound proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto nitrocellulose filter. The filters were washed with TTBS then phosphate-buffered saline. Proteins on the filter were denatured with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in TBB solution (20 mm Tris pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 75 mm KCl) and renatured by sequential incubation (10 min each) in 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, 0.187, and 0 m guanidine hydrochloride in TBB solution. Filters were blocked with nucleic acid binding buffer (Tris pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaCl, and 1× Denhardt's solution) for 30 min. The filters were incubated with the radiolabeled DNA or RNA probes for 1 h at room temperature, then washed with the nucleic acid binding buffer (three times, 5 min each) before autoradiography. A single-stranded DNA probe was prepared with [α-32P]dATP using the random primer-labeling kit (Stratagene) with sheared single-stranded salmon sperm DNA as the template. To compare the binding preference of PIR1 for single-stranded DNA or RNA by Southwestern and Northwestern blot analyses, cDNAs encoding PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1, cyclin A, p45SKP2, p27KIP1, and p21WAF1 were each PCR amplified with T3 and T7 primers from the corresponding pBluescript-based plasmid. The PCR products were gel-purified, pooled, and used as templates. The 32P-labeled DNA probe was prepared by asymmetric PCR using Taq DNA polymerase, T3 primer, and [α-32P]dATP for 40 cycles. The32P-labeled RNA probe was generated with T3 RNA polymerase using [α-32P]ATP and the Riboprobe kit (Promega) for 1 h at 30 °C. Both [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]ATP were used at 4 × 105cpm/pmol in the labeling reactions. The DNA and RNA probes were each purified with G25 sizing column (Boehringer Mannheim) and adjusted to 106 cpm/ml for filter binding assays. YRG2 (Stratagene) cells were transformed with 400 μg of HeLa pGADGH library DNA (12Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and 400 μg of pGBT9-PIR1 DNA. Transformants were selected for histidine, leucine, and tryptophan prototrophs according to Stratagene's protocol. Histidine prototroph colonies (His+) were then tested by the β-galactosidase assay. About 100 His+β-galactosidase+ colonies were obtained, and 20 of them were further analyzed. Plasmids were recovered from the yeast cells and the pGADGH constructs were selected in theEscherichia coli MH4 strain (12Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1731-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) based on their ability to confer leucine prototroph. pGADGH plasmids were then re-transformed into YRG2 strain together with either pGBT9-PIR1 or pGBT9-CDK6 plasmid. Plasmids encoding proteins that showed specific interaction with PIR1 but not with CDK6 were sequenced. The positive cDNAs that were fused in-frame with the upstream Gal4 activation domain include genes encoding splicing factor 9G8 or SRp30C. HeLa cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCGT-PIR1 and 19 μg of pUC18 carrier DNA by the calcium phosphate method. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline 36 h post-transfection and permeabilized with CSK buffer (10 mmPipes, pH 6.8, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) (13Huang S. Deerinck T.J. Ellisman M.H. Spector D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 877-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). For the nuclease sensitivity experiments, cells were incubated at 27 °C for 1 h with CSK buffer supplemented with either (i) 400 units/ml DNase I, 20 mm vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex and 50 mm NaCl; (ii) 0.1 mg/ml RNase A; or (iii) 20 mm vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex and 50 mmNaCl (control). The cells were then extracted with 250 mm(NH4)2SO4 in CSK buffer at room temperature for 10 min and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in CSK buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were stained with anti-T epitope antibody (Novagen), followed by rhodamine-conjugated donkey antibody to mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). For immunocolocalization of PIR1 and SC35, cells were permeabilized in CSK buffer in the absence of RNase A inhibitor (vanadyl-ribonucleoside complex) at 27 °C for 1 h, extracted with 250 mm (NH4)2SO4 in CSK buffer at room temperature for 10 min and then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in CSK buffer. Cells were stained with monoclonal antibody SC35 (ATCC), followed by rhodamine-conjugated donkey antibody to mouse IgG. The coverslips were then incubated with biotinylated anti-T epitope antibody (Novagen) followed by fluorescein-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Cells were examined with a Bio-Rad confocal microscope MRC-600 and the imaging data was processed with computer program Adobe Photoshop 4.0. To identify novel dual-specificity phosphatases, we have used primers corresponding to the conserved sequences HCTHGIN and FEQARGH in the catalytic domain of several dual-specificity phosphatases to amplify gene sequences from human cDNA libraries by polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we have used these sequences to directly search the GenBankTM EST data base. These combined approaches have led us to identify a partial cDNA (EST clone H60626) that potentially encoded a novel phosphatase. To obtain its full-length cDNA, we used the EST clone H60626 as a probe to screen a cDNA library constructed from ML1 cells (a human myeloid cell line). The full-length cDNA sequence consists of 1593 nucleotides that potentially encode a protein of 329 amino acids (Fig.1 A). We have named this novel phosphatase PIR1 (phosphatase that interacts with RNA/RNP complex 1). Sequence analysis of PIR1 shows that it is closely related to several dual-specificity phosphatases at the amino acid level (Fig.1 B), such as BVP, encoded by the baculovirus Autograph Californica (35% identity) (14Sheng Z. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4728-4733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); two open reading frames identified by the Caenorhabditis elegans genome project T23G7.5 (31% identity) and F54C8.4 (23% identity); and CEL-1 (25% identity). CEL-1 is recently shown to be a phosphatase in C. elegans that can remove 5′-phosphate from newly transcribed RNA molecules and is potentially involved in the mRNA capping reaction (15Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition to harboring the protein tyrosine phosphatase signature motif, PIR1 has several interesting features. It contains two stretches of arginine-rich sequences that are found in some of the RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 1 A). PIR1 is also rich in lysine and histidine residues, and the protein is predicted to contain 17 basic charges at the neutral pH. PIR1 also carries a proline-rich region, a motif known to interact with the Src-homology 3 domain. We have examined the expression pattern of PIR1 in various human cell lines by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2). PIR1 was widely expressed with the most abundant messages in HaCaT (human keratinocyte cell line), A431 (human epidermoid cells), and ML1 (human myeloblastic). Interestingly, in several transformed cell lines that lack functional p53 and/or pRb, such as 293 (human embryonic kidney cells), HeLa (human cervical epitheloid carcinoma), and Saos2 cells (human osteosarcoma), the PIR1 level was quite low. Whether the PIR1 mRNA level may be regulated by p53 or pRb tumor suppressor protein needs to be further studied. No expression of the PIR1 message was observed in PC12 (rat pheochromocytoma) cells, although we cannot rule out the possibility that human PIR1 cDNA probe had failed to recognize its rat homolog. Although PIR1 carries the signature motif of protein tyrosine phosphatase, whether it bears protein phosphatase activity needs to be directly demonstrated. To do so, we have expressed PIR1 in insect Sf9 cells using the recombinant baculoviruses because the PIR1 protein is not stable in E. coli. We have expressed a fusion protein in which PIR1 was fused at the C terminus of GST (GST-PIR1). GST-PIR1 were affinity-purified by binding to glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-PIR1 displayed protein tyrosine phosphatase activity toward tyrosyl-phosphorylated poly(GluTyr) (Fig.3). Poly(GluTyr) is a random polymer of glutamate and tyrosine, and the tyrosyl-phosphorylated poly(GluTyr) has been shown to be an excellent in vitro substrate for dual-specificity phosphatases such as PTEN/MMAC1/TEP1 (10Myers M.P. Stolarov J.P. Eng C. Li J. Wang S.I. Wigler M.H. Parsons R. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9052-9057Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). As control, we have assayed in parallel the PIR1 derivative carrying the cysteine 152 to serine mutation (C152S) in the tyrosine phosphatase signature motif. The tyrosine phosphatase activity of GST-PIR1 was abolished by the C152S mutation (Fig. 3). These studies suggest that PIR1 possesses an intrinsic protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. Under similar conditions, we could not detect phosphatase activity using phosphoseryl/threonyl casein as substrate (data not shown). This could be because of the substrate selectivity of PIR1. It remains possible that in vivo PIR1 may dephosphorylate phosphoseryl/threonyl residues in addition to phosphotyrosyl residues with its physiological substrates. PIR1 contains two stretches of arginine-rich regions (Fig.1 A). Because the arginine-rich regions in the viral protein Rev and Tat are known to be involved in binding to RNA (16Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), we tested whether PIR1 can interact with RNA. Because many RNA-binding proteins can bind to both RNA and single-stranded DNA in vitro, we first tested whether PIR1 can bind to single-stranded DNA. Wild type PIR1 or PIR1(CS) mutant were expressed as T epitope-tagged forms by recombinant baculoviruses in Sf9 cells. When the cell lysates from such baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells were incubated with single-stranded DNA immobilized on agarose beads, most of the PIR1 or PIR1(CS) proteins were retained on the beads (Fig.4 A). The binding of PIR1 or PIR1(CS) to single-stranded DNA beads was resistant to a 0.25m salt wash, and even after a 1 m salt wash, a substantial fraction of the proteins were still retained on the beads (Fig. 4 A). The relative resistance of PIR1-DNA interactions to medium salt washes suggests that PIR1 or its CS mutant protein can bind to single-stranded DNA with high affinity. Because the binding of PIR1 to single-stranded DNA in crude cell lysates can be mediated either by PIR1 directly or through its association with nucleic acid-binding proteins, we therefore performed Southwestern blot analysis to examine whether PIR1 can interact with single-stranded DNA directly. In this assay, GST-PIR1 or its CS derivative was affinity-purified, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and blotted to nitrocellulose. The proteins on the filters were subjected to denaturation and renaturation and then incubated with32P-labeled single-stranded DNA probe derived from the salmon sperm DNA template. After washing, the bound radiolabeled probe was detected by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 4 B, both GST-PIR1 or GST-PIR1(CS) bound to single-stranded DNA with comparable affinity in this assay. To examine the specificity of the binding, we used the GST-MKP-1 protein as a control. No single-stranded DNA binding was observed for GST-MKP-1, although Coomassie Blue staining confirmed that all GST-fusion proteins were present in about equal amounts (Fig.4 B). Our subsequent studies showed that similar single-stranded DNA binding could be achieved even when the denaturation and renaturation step was omitted (data not shown), suggesting that the native conformation of these proteins may not be required for the nucleic acid binding. In addition, this assay showed that both the wild type PIR1 and the catalytically inactive CS mutant protein bound to RNA with comparable affinity, suggesting that the PTP activity of the enzyme is not required for the binding. To examine whether PIR1 shows binding preference for RNA or single-stranded DNA, we performed the filter binding assay using either32P-labeled RNA or 32P-labeled single-stranded DNA as probes, referred to as Northwestern blot and Southwestern blot analysis, respectively. The RNA and DNA probes used were of defined sequences and were both generated with the same set of DNA templates. To increase the sequence complexity of the defined probes, we have used a mixture of several cDNAs clones as templates. These cDNAs include TEP1/PTEN/MMAC1 (9Li D.-M. Sun H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2124-2129PubMed Google Scholar), cyclin A (17Minshull J. Golsteyn R. Hill C.S. Hunt T.

Cell. 1995; 82: 915-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar), p27KIP1 (19Polyak K. Lee M.-H. Erdjument-Breomage H. Koff A. Roberts J.M. Tempst P. Massague J.

Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3162) Google Scholar). Both 32P-labeled RNA and DNA probes were of same specific activity and were used at 2 × 106 cpm/ml for the filter binding assay. As shown in Fig.4 C, PIR1 exhibited higher affinity for RNA since more probe binding and less PIR1 protein required for the binding was observed for the labeled RNA than the DNA probe. To gain an insight into the cellular processes that are regulated by PIR1, we have employed the yeast two-hybrid screen method to identify proteins that may interact with PIR1. By screening the HeLa cDNA yeast two-hybrid library with PIR1 as a bait, we have identified ∼100 positive clones in both histidine prototroph and β-galactosidase assay, and 20 of them were chosen for further analysis. These plasmids were recovered from yeast colonies. To test the specificity of the interaction with the bait protein, each plasmid was then retransformed into the yeast strain together with a bait plasmid encoding either PIR1 or CDK6. The plasmids that conferred interactions only with PIR1, but not with CDK6 control, were then sequenced. Two of the cDNA clones were found to encode splicing factors 9G8 or SRp30C, both as an in-frame fusion with the upstream Gal4 transcription activation domain (Fig. 5). Both 9G8 and SRp30C belong to the SR family splicing factors, which share a domain containing serine and arginine repeats and are components of the mRNA-splicing complexes (21Misteli T. Spector D.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 135-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). So far, we have not been able to detect physical association between PIR1 and splicing factors in mammalian cells. It is possible that the interaction of PIR1 with splicing factors 9G8 or SRp30C is mediated through an RNA intermediate, as PIR1 itself can bind to RNA directly, and our coimmunoprecipitation method may not be sensitive enough to detect such interaction. To examine the cellular localization of PIR1, we expressed the T epitope-tagged PIR1 in HeLa cells by the transient transfection method, followed by immunofluorescence staining with anti-T epitope antibody. PIR1 was localized to the nuclei with the exclusion of the nucleolus, and no staining was observed when cells were transfected with the vector alone (Fig. 6, A andB). To determine whether PIR1 in cells is associated with certain nucleic acids or protein complexes involved in nucleic acids metabolism, we subjected the permeabilized cells to DNase I or RNase A treatment before fixation. Although PIR1 staining was not affected by pretreatment with DNase I, it was greatly diminished by pretreatment with RNase A (Fig. 6, C and D). The sensitivity of PIR1 staining to RNase A suggests that PIR1 in mammalian cells is associated with RNA and/or RNP complexes involved in nuclear mRNA metabolism. Because PIR1 interacts with splicing factors in the yeast two-hybrid system, we examined whether PIR1 is colocalized with proteins involved in mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. Several splicing factors, including SC35, are known to exhibit a speckled immunofluorescence pattern (22Spector D.L. Fu X.D. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3467-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Speckles are believed to be storage sites for certain splicing factors, and mRNA transcription, splicing, and maturation have been reported to take place in close proximity to speckles (21Misteli T. Spector D.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 135-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Because the staining of PIR1 exhibits a nonuniform staining pattern (Fig. 6 B), we wondered if removal of the diffused PIR1 staining would allow us to detect certain PIR1-associated subnuclear structures. We modified the immunostaining procedure so that the cells were permeabilized in the absence of RNase inhibitor to allow limited RNase digestion to take place. Under this condition, the ectopically expressed PIR1 was observed in speckles, which was reminiscent of the pattern known for the distribution of SC35 (22Spector D.L. Fu X.D. Maniatis T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3467-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). We therefore performed a double immunostaining experiment in the PIR1-transfected HeLa cells and examined whether a fraction of PIR1 colocalizes with SC35 by confocal fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig.7, both the exogenous PIR1 and endogenous SC35 exhibited the speckled pattern, which was superimposable, suggesting that PIR1 partially colocalizes with SC35 in these cells. These studies provide further support that PIR1 is associated with RNA and/or RNP in the mRNA processing or maturation process. Our studies demonstrate that PIR1 is a novel member of the dual-specificity subfamily of protein tyrosine phosphatases that exhibits high affinity to RNA. PIR1 bound directly to the in vitro transcribed RNAs derived from cDNA templates. Using PIR1 as a bait, we have isolated cDNA clones encoding accessory splicing factors 9G8 and SRp30C that showed specific interactions with PIR1 in the yeast two-hybrid system. When ectopically expressed in HeLa cells, PIR1 manifested a nuclear staining pattern, and the staining was removed by pretreatment of cells with RNase A but not DNase I. Furthermore, a fraction of PIR1 was colocalized with the splicing factor SC35 in speckles. PIR1 is the first member in the protein tyrosine phosphatase family that shows high affinity for RNA bothin vitro and in vivo. Our studies suggest that PIR1 may participate in nuclear mRNA metabolism. Increasing evidence suggests the participation of protein kinases and phosphatases in mRNA processing (21Misteli T. Spector D.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 135-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 23Dreyfuss G. Hentze M. Lamond A.I. Cell. 1996; 85: 963-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For example, a dual-specificity kinase Clk/Sty is found to be a partner with SR splicing factors in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and a catalytic inactive form of this kinase is colocalized with SR splicing factors in speckles in transfected cells (24Colwill K. Pawson T. Andrews B. Prasad J. Manley J.L. Bell J.C. Duncan P.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Serine/threonine phosphatase 1, or a serine/threonine phosphatase-1-like activity, has been shown to affect the subnuclear localization of the splicing factors (25Misteli T. Spector D.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1559-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). More recently, CEL-1, a phosphatase in C. elegans was shown to be a 5′ triphosphatase for RNA molecules and was suggested to be involved in the mRNA capping reaction (15Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Whether PIR1 is involved in regulating pre-mRNA splicing or other aspects of mRNA metabolism such as capping, polyadenylation, stability, or transport awaits further studies. One interesting question arising from our studies is which region or domain in PIR1 mediates its interaction with RNA. Our observations that both the wild type PIR1 and its catalytically inactive C152S mutant bind to RNA with comparable affinity, and our data that binding can take place with denatured phosphatases raises the interesting possibility that interaction of PIR1 with RNA may not require the catalytic center nor the native conformation of the enzyme. One possibility is that PIR1 binds to RNA through its arginine-rich sequences. Several specific RNA binding proteins, such as Rev and Tat, are known to contain an arginine-rich motif (16Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar). Rev, a protein encoded by HIV, can bind and facilitate nuclear export of intron-containing viral RNA. Tat, also encoded by HIV, is involved in the regulation of transcription by binding to viral mRNA. Very little identity is found between the arginine-rich motif sequences except for the richness of arginine residues. Further studies are required to determine whether the arginine-rich regions in PIR1 mediate its binding to RNA. We would like to thank Drs. Susan Baserga and Hui Zhang for helpful discussions and critical reading of the manuscript, Peer Bork and Anne Marie Quinn for assistance with the computer sequence analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2033713659,"Studies of hsp90 in yeast have supported the notion that this chaperone plays a critical role in signaling by steroid receptors. One limitation to these studies is that yeast expressing hsp90 mutants may also be deficient in fundamental cellular functions of the chaperone required for steroid-dependent induction of transcription. In this work, we have prepared mutants of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that permit analysis of hsp90 binding and transcriptional activity in cells with normal chaperone function. Our previous data supported a model in which hsp90 binds to the receptor steroid binding domain according to a two-site model. By amino acid mutagenesis of these two sites, we have now generated three receptor mutants and analyzed their function. Upon their translation<i>in vitro</i>, all three mutants interacted with hsp90 similarly to the wild-type receptor. However, one mutant, P643A (GRo), was of particular interest because, although it showed normal steroid binding and transformation to a glucocorticoid response element-specific DNA binding form, it was remarkably deficient in nuclear translocation and transcriptional function at 37 °C. Furthermore, GRo·hsp90 heterocomplexes formed <i>in vivo</i> or assembled under cell-free conditions were much less stable than wild-type GR·hsp90 heterocomplexes. Our results demonstrate that Pro-643 plays a critical role in both stabilizing the receptor·hsp90 complex and in permitting an efficient nuclear translocation and, thus, support the concept that the chaperone is an integral component of the steroid-receptor signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1993232604,"Abstract The protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 plays a central role in T-cell activation. Following receptor engagement, ZAP-70 is recruited to the phosphorylated subunits of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). This event results in ZAP-70 activation and in association of ZAP-70 with a number of signaling proteins. Among these is the Shc adaptor, which couples the activated TCR to Ras. Shc interaction with ZAP-70 is mediated by the Shc PTB domain. The inhibitory effect of a Shc mutant containing the isolated PTB domain suggests that Shc interaction with ZAP-70 might be required for TCR signaling. Here, we show that a point mutation (Phe474) of the putative Shc binding site on ZAP-70, spanning tyrosine 474, prevented ZAP-70 interaction with Shc and the subsequent binding of Shc to phospho-ζ. Neither ZAP-70 catalytic activity nor the pattern of protein phosphorylation induced by TCR triggering was affected by this mutation. However expression of the Phe474 ZAP-70 mutant resulted in impaired TCR-dependent gene activation. ZAP-70 could effectively phosphorylate Shc in vitro. Only the CH domain, which contains the two Grb2 binding sites on Shc, was phosphorylated by ZAP-70. Both Grb2 binding sites were excellent substrates for ZAP-70. The data show that Tyr474 on ZAP-70 is required for TCR signaling and suggest that Shc association with ZAP-70 and the resulting phosphorylation of Shc might be an obligatory step in linking the activated TCR to the Ras pathway."

Here we report the cloning and analysis of the nucleotide sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of W and T dsRNAs. Both (+) strands have conserved 5′ end GGGGC and 3′ end GCCCC-OH sequences. Primer extension analysis and RNase protection experiments confirmed that the single-stranded forms (20 S RNA and 23 S RNA) are identical to the (+) strands of the corresponding double-stranded forms (W and T) and that all these RNAs are linear molecules. S1 and V1 secondary structure mapping of the 3′ ends confirm that not only 20 S RNA and 23 S RNA share similar sequences at their ends but 3′ end secondary structures as well. These sequences and secondary structures are similar to those found at the 3′ ends of the genomic RNAs in (+) strand single-stranded RNA coliphages. Based on the available data we believe that 20 S and 23 S RNAs are similar to positive-stranded RNA viruses. Yeast strain used was strain 37-4C (a leu, kar1–1, 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA, W, T, L-A-0, L-BC-0) (2Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). W and T dsRNAs from strain 37-4C were purified by CF-11 cellulose chromatography as described previously (22Toh-e A. Guerry P. Wickner R.B. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 136: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Then, W and T dsRNAs were separated on an agarose gel, electroeluted from the gel, and further passed through Elutip columns (Schleicher & Schuell). 20 S RNA and 23 S RNA were purified from strain 37-4C grown under induction conditions as described (3Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban L.M. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12772-12778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown for 48 h to stationary phase, washed, and incubated in the presence of 1% potassium acetate for 14–16 h to achieve induction of 20 S RNA and 23 S RNA (23Wejksnora P. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total nucleic acids were separated on 1.5% agarose gels, and 23 S RNA or 20 S RNA were electroeluted from the gel, extracted once with phenol:chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. To isolate the + and − strands of W dsRNA, the dsRNA was first denatured in the presence of 7 m urea at 90 °C for 1 min and then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide strand separation gel (24Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Both strands were located by ethidium bromide staining, excised from the gel, and purified. To clone the 3′ ends of (+) and (−) strands of W and T dsRNAs, we used 3′ RACE (25Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 28-38Google Scholar). The 3′ ends of W and T dsRNAs were first A-tailed using poly(A) polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a buffer that contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 125 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm ATP, 0.25 μg/μl bovine serum albumin. The poly(A)-tailed RNAs were then denatured with CH3HgOH (hydroxymethyl mercuric hydroxide) as described (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar), and cDNA was synthesized using oligonucleotide Bam-dT16 (5′-CCGGATCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3′) and Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). PCR amplification of the cDNAs was carried out using oligo Bam-dT16 and one of four oligonucleotides that are complementary to the internal regions of W or T dsRNAs located at around 200 nt from the end of the known sequences. The four internal primers used are PG6 (2191–5′-CGAATCGTCGCCAGTAG-3′-2207) and NR2 (175–5′-GACGGCTCCAACCGTAG-3′-159) for the (+) and (−) strands of W dsRNA and NR23 (2716–5′-TTCATGGGCCTTCGCCCC-3′-2733) and NR22 (208- 5′-GAGTCCACGTCGTAACGC-3′-225) for the (+) and (−) strands of T dsRNA, respectively. Amplification was carried out using TaqDNA polymerase (Promega) for 30 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 50 °C for 1 min, and extension at 70 °C for 1 min 30 s). The products were digested with BamHI and another restriction enzyme that cut in the known sequence of the amplified fragment and then ligated into pBluescript SK+ or KS+ (Stratagene) predigested with appropriate enzymes. pALI17 contained the complete cDNA sequence of 20 S RNA fused to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and theSmaI site of pBluescript-KS+ vector. Run-off transcription of SmaI-digested pALI17 by T7 RNA polymerase, therefore, gave transcripts that have the entire sequence of 20 S RNA with the correct 5′ and 3′ ends. Plasmid pALI22 contained 20 S RNA cDNA sequences from nt 2288 to 2514 cloned between the HindIII and SmaI sites of pBluescript-SK+ vector. T7 Run-off transcription of SmaI-digested pALI22 gave the 273-nt RNA transcript WHindIII, which contains 227 nt from the 20 S RNA 3′ end with an upstream 46-nt vector sequence. Plasmid pNR27 contained the entire 23 S RNA cDNA nucleotide sequence (2891 base pairs) cloned into the unique SmaI site of pBluescript-SK+ vector. Plasmid pRE443 contained sequences of 23 S RNA cDNA from nt 2750 to 2891 cloned into the SmaI site of pBluescript SK+ vector. T7 run-off transcription of SmaI-digested pRE443 gave the 215-nt RNA transcript TSpeI, which contained 142 nt from 23 S RNA 3′ end and 73-nt upstream sequence derived from the vector. Plasmids pW3-2 and pT3-8 are reverse transcription-PCR-generated cDNA clones containing the last 227 nt of W or the last 143 nt of T (+) strand 3′ ends followed by a poly(A) tract. To confirm the ends of the clones, we performed primer extension analysis (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We used oligonucleotides NR2 and NR22 as primers to analyze the 5′ ends of W (+) strands (and 20 S RNA) and T (+) strands (and 23 S RNA), respectively. For W (−) strands and T (−) strands, we used oligonucleotides NR1 (2433–5′-GGGCCGGATGGGCGACT-3′-2449) and LM5 (2812–5′-GGCCGCCCGCCACCTTCA-3′-2829), respectively. Primers were labeled at their 5′ ends with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Manheim) as described (26Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Phosphorylated primers were mixed with purified template RNAs and ethanol-precipitated. The pellets were dissolved in 30 μl of hybridization buffer containing 40 mm Pipes, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 80% formamide and incubated for 10 min at 85 °C. After annealing at 40 °C overnight, nucleic acids were precipitated with ethanol. cDNA synthesis was carried out at 42 °C for 1 h with Superscript reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). The extended products were separated on a 7 m urea 6% acrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. For RNase protection experiments, we used the RPAIITM ribonuclease protection assay kit from Ambion. 32P-Labeled RNA probes with sequences complementary to the 3′ ends of W and T (+) strands were generated by run-off transcription with T3 RNA polymerase fromPvuII-digested pW3-2 and EagI-digested pT3-8, respectively. The 32P-labeled probes were separated in a denaturing acrylamide gel and purified from the gel as mentioned above. The probe was then annealed with 20 S RNA or W (+) strands or with 23 S RNA or T (+) strands, depending on the probe used. The RNA hybrids were digested with a mixture of RNase A and RNase T1 under high salt, and the protected RNA fragments were separated on a 7 m urea 6% polyacryalamide gel and detected by autoradiography. W dsRNA or small RNA transcripts corresponding to the 3′ ends of W (+) strand (20 S RNA) or T (+) strand (23 S RNA) were 3′ end-labeled with [32P]pCp (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham) and T4 RNA ligase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 30-μl reaction mixture. The conditions were as suggested by the enzyme supplier. The labeled RNA was denatured and separated in 5% polyacrylamide strand separation gels (24Rodrı́guez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2761-2766Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 3′-end-labeled transcripts or W (+) strands were excised from the gel and extracted with 0.5 ml of 0.5 m ammonium acetate, 1 mmEDTA overnight at room temperature. The samples were then filtered through glass wool to remove polyacrylamide and precipitated with ethanol. The labeled RNA (5000–20000 cpm) was first preincubated in the reaction buffer for 10 min at 37 °C and then digested with Nuclease S1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) or RNase V1 (Amersham). Nuclease S1 digestion was performed in a reaction mixture (6 μl) containing 30 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 1 mm zinc acetate, 5% glycerol, 80 mm NaCl, 0.5 μg of tRNA, and 0.2, 2, or 10 units of S1 nuclease (28Hannig E.M. Leibowitz M.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4379-4400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RNase V1 digestion was done in a buffer (6 μl) that contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5 μg of tRNA, and 0.009 or 0.018 units of RNase V1. Nuclease treatments were done at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 μl of 100 mm EDTA and the same volume of loading buffer (10 m urea, 1.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). To generate a sequence ladder, alkaline hydrolysis was carried out at 90 °C for 7 min in a 6-μl reaction volume that contained 50 mm sodium bicarbonate/carbonate, pH 9.2, 3 μg of tRNA, and twice the amount of labeled RNA used for the enzymatic digestions. The cleaved products were analyzed on 7 m urea 20% or 10% polyacrylamide gels. Plasmid DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52865) Google Scholar) using T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham). In vitro run-off RNA transcription by T7 or T3 RNA polymerases (Promega) was carried out using plasmids linearized with appropriate restriction enzymes. Then the DNA template was digested with 1 μg of DNase I (Promega) for 15 min at 37 °C. RNA secondary structure prediction was done using the RNAFOLD program (30Zuker M. Stiegler P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 133-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2643) Google Scholar). RNA coliphages nucleotide sequences were retrieved from the EMBL data bank. Previously we cloned and sequenced random primer-generated cDNAs from W and T dsRNAs. In these works we obtained 2505- and 2871-base pair nucleotide sequences for W and T dsRNAs, respectively. As judged from the mobilities in denaturing acrylamide gels of in vitro made transcripts with these sequences, we estimated that our cDNA sequences lacked only a few nucleotides at the ends of these RNAs. To understand the replication mechanism of these RNAs, however, it is essential to know the exact nucleotide sequences of these molecules, especially at both ends. To clone the ends of both RNAs, we used the method called 3′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNAends) (25Frohman M.A. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 28-38Google Scholar). W or T dsRNAs were first poly(A)-tailed at the 3′ ends using poly(A) polymerase. The poly(A)-tailed RNA was denatured and annealed with the deoxyoligonucleotide primer Bam-dT16, which could hybridize to the poly(A) tail with its 3′ end oligo dT sequence. The cDNA was then synthesized with reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was amplified by PCR using Bam-dT16 and a second primer. We used four sets of second primers. Each of them had a nucleotide sequence identical to an internal region close to the 3′ end of either strand of W or T dsRNA, thus providing the specificity in cDNA amplification. Finally the amplified cDNAs were cloned into Bluescript vectors. We sequenced 5–10 clones derived from each amplification. TableI summarizes the results of sequencing, which are shown as the (+) strand sequences. The majority of sequences derived from each amplified end had a cluster of four C residues accentuated by a downstream poly(A) tract. If we assume that the fourth C adjacent to the poly(A) tract represents the end of each dsRNA, the total numbers of the nucleotide sequences of W and T dsRNAs are 2514 and 2891 base pairs, respectively.Table I5′ and 3′ end sequences of W and T (+) strands5′ ends3′ endsW (+) strands/20 S RNAGGGGCUGAUCCCAUG...(7)...UGAGGCCACGGCCCC(5)T (+) strands/23 S RNAGGGGCCA UG...(6)...CCGGGCCUGAGCCCC(5) GGGCCA UG...(2)...CCGGGCCUGAGCC(1)GGCCA UG...(1)...CCGGGCCU(1)Newly acquired nucleotide sequences in the reverse transcription-PCR-generated clones are underlined.

The number of independent clones in each case are indicated in parenthesis. Initiation and termination codons for p91 (20 S RNA) or p104 (23 S RNA) are in boldface. We added poly(A) tails at the 3′ ends of W and T dsRNAs during cloning. If W or T dsRNA had extra A residues downstream of the successive 4 C residues at the 3′ ends, these A residues could not be distinguished from the poly(A) tail attached by the poly(A) polymerase. This is the intrinsic problem associated with the 3′ RACE method. Therefore we needed to evaluate whether these successive 4 C residues were the true ends of these RNAs. For this purpose, two approaches were undertaken: primer extension analysis and RNase protection experiments. In the primer extension experiments, purified (+) or (−) strands of W dsRNA or denatured T dsRNA were mixed with a 5′ end-labeled oligo primer that was complementary to the 5′ end region of the RNA. Then the labeled primer was extended toward the 5′ end of the template by reverse transcription. As shown in Fig.2 A, lane 1, the primer complementary to the 5′ end region of W (+) strand was fully extended and terminated as a single band at the position corresponding to the last 3′ end C of the W (−) strand. This result clearly indicates that the 5′ end sequence of W (+) strand shown in Table I is correct and has no preceding extra Ts. When the T (+) strands were examined similarly by primer extension, we obtained again a single band of the extended primer terminating at the position corresponding to the last C of the clustered 4 C residues nested at the 3′ end of T (−) strands (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). This result again indicates that the 5′ end sequence of T (+) strands shown in Table I is correct and has no extra nucleotide sequences at the 5′ end. We also examined the (−) strands of W and T dsRNAs and obtained the same results; that is, the first nucleotides of the 5′ ends of W and T (−) strands are G and there are no extra Ts attached to them (not shown). It should be pointed out that although the cloning of each end of W and T dsRNA by 3′ RACE was manipulated at their 3′ ends, the primer extension experiments shown in Fig. 2 directly analyzed the 5′ end of each RNA strand. The fact that these two independent but complementary experiments gave consistent results strongly suggests that our cloned sequences are correct and represent the real W and T end sequences. Logically, however, the possibility still remains that there exists a nonbase-pairing poly(A) tail at the 3′ end of W or T (+) strands. To rule out this possibility, we undertook a second experimental approach; RNase protection experiments. We made uniformly labeled RNA in vitro that had the nucleotide sequence from base 2514 to 2288 (numbering refers to the (+) strand sequence) of the W (−) strand attached to the 5′ upstream poly(T) sequence (Fig.3 A). This probe therefore can hybridize to the 3′ end region of W (+) strand. If W (+) strands have poly(A) tails at their 3′ ends, a part of the poly(T) sequence of the probe complementary to the poly(A) tail should be protected from RNase digestion. As shown in Fig. 3 A, a part of the probe corresponding to W (−) strand from base 2514 to 2288 was fully protected, but the 5′ end poly(T) sequence was completely digested with the RNases (lanes 4 and 5). When the 3′ end of the T (+) strand was examined using a similar probe, a portion of the probe corresponding to the T (−) strand sequence from base 2891 to 2812 was fully protected, but again, the adjacent upstream poly(T) sequence was completely digested (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5). These results, therefore, (i) confirm the correctness of our 3′ end nucleotide sequences of W and T (+) strands and (ii) clearly rule out the possibility that the W and T (+) strands have non-base paring poly(A) tails at their 3′ ends. Altogether, the results from primer extension analysis and RNase protection experiments indicate that the 3′ end sequences of W and T dsRNAs obtained by 3′ RACE are genuine, and that there are no non-base paring poly(A) tails at their 3′ ends. Thus we have now established the complete nucleotide sequences of W and T dsRNAs.Figure 5Nuclease S1 and V1 mapping of W (+) strand 3′ end. A, S1 mapping. 3′ end-labeled W (+) strands (lanes 8 to 10) or WHindIII transcript (lanes 3 to 5) were digested with various amounts of nuclease S1 (0.2, 2, or 10 units (U)) or mocked-treated (lane C) and separated on a 7 m urea 20% acrylamide gel. Cleaved products were detected by autoradiography. Arrows indicate the positions of the two most sensitive regions to S1 digestion, designated as loop I and loop II. The size of the cleaved products was estimated from an RNA ladder obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of the samples (lane -OH). The larger RNA fragments from the W (+) strands were resolved in a 10% acrylamide gel and shown on the upper right panel. Diagrams of the W (+) strand and the WHindIII transcripts are shown at the bottom of the autoradiograms. WHindIII transcripts contain the 3′ end fragment of W (+) strand from nt 2288 to 2514 and the upstream vector-derived sequence (open square). B, V1 mapping. The same samples as in A were digested with 0.009 or 0.018 units of RNase V1 (lanes 3 and 4 for the WHindIII transcript or lanes 9 and 10 for W (+) strands) or mocked-treated (lane C). The cleaved products were separated on a 7 m urea 20% acrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. For comparison, we analyzed the same samples digested with 2 units of nuclease S1 in the same gel (lanes 6 and12). Arrows indicate positions highly sensitive to V1 digestion (numbered from the 3′ end). The positions of loop I and loop II from the S1 digestion are also indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previously we proposed that 20 S and 23 S RNAs are identical to the (+) strands of W and T dsRNA, respectively, based on the following evidence. (i) All the strains carrying W and T dsRNA also harbor 20 S and 23 S RNA, respectively, and vice versa. (ii) Specific probes for the (+) strands of W (or T) dsRNA hybridize with 20 S (or 23S) RNA. (iii) 20 S (or 23 S) RNA was indistinguishable from the (+) strands of W (or T) dsRNA in denaturing and strand separation acrylamide gels. (iv) The known nucleotide sequence of 20 S RNA (2479 base pairs) (12Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12779-12783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is identical to the W (+) strand sequence from base 13 to base 2491. Since we have obtained the complete sequences of W and T dsRNAs, we asked whether 20 S and 23 S RNA have the same corresponding sequences at their ends. The 5′ end of 20 S RNA was examined by primer extension with the same oligonucleotide used for W (+) strands. As shown in Fig.2 A, lane 2, the primer was extended and terminated as a single band at the same position where the 5′ end of the W (+) strand terminates. This result indicates that 20 S RNA has the same primer binding site at the same distance from the 5′ end as the W (+) strand. When the 5′ end of 23 S RNA was analyzed similarly with the primer used for the T (+) strands, we obtained the same result; that is, the primer was terminated as a single band at the same position corresponding to the 5′ end terminus of the T (+) strand (Fig.2 B, lane 2). Therefore, the primer extension analysis indicates that the 5′ ends of 20 S RNA and 23 S RNA are indistinguishable from those of W and T (+) strands, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2163199165,"Upon ligand activation, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, thereby recruiting intracellular signaling proteins such as Shc. EGFR binding of Shc proteins results in their tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the Ras and Erk pathways. Shc interaction with activated receptor tyrosine kinases is mediated by two distinct phosphotyrosine interaction domains, an NH2-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and a COOH-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain. The relative importance of these two domains for EGFR binding was examined by determining if expression of the isolated SH2 or PTB domain of ShcC would inhibit EGFR signaling. The SH2 domain potently inhibited numerous aspects of EGFR signaling including activation of Erk2 and the Elk-1 transcription factor as well as EGFR-dependent transformation. Furthermore, the SH2 domain inhibited focus formation by the Neu oncoprotein, another EGFR family member. Surprisingly, inhibition of the EGFR by the SH2 domain did not involve stable association with the receptor. In contrast, the PTB domain associated quite well with the receptor yet had little effect on EGFR signaling. Although the EGFR cytoplasmic tail contains consensus binding sites for the PTB and SH2 domains of ShcC, and both domains of ShcC interact with the receptor in vitro, the SH2 domain is more potent for inhibiting receptor function in vivo. However, inhibition is not due to stable association with the receptor, suggesting that the SH2 domain is binding to a heretofore unknown protein(s) necessary for proper EGFR function.

RTKs regulate a multitude of intracellular signaling pathways. One such pathway involves the Shc adaptor proteins. Shc proteins are part of a diverse family of proteins encoded by at least three separate genes, shcA, shcB, andshcC (1Nakamura T. Sanokawa R. Sasaki Y. Ayusawa D. Oishi M. Mori N. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar, 2O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All Shc proteins share a similar structural arrangement that includes an NH2-terminal phosphotyrosine binding domain (PTB), a central Gly- and Pro-rich region (CH1), and a COOH-terminal Src homology 2 domain (SH2). In addition, each gene encodes multiple splice forms that may possess distinct activities (5Migliaccio E. Mele S. Salcini A. Pelicci G. Lai K.-M.V. Superti-Furga G. Pawson T. Di Fiore P.P.

In particular, Shc proteins are thought to link RTKs with regulation of the Ras pathway (7Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 259-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Shc proteins bind the adaptor protein Grb2, which, like Shc proteins, also possesses an SH2 domain in addition to two flanking SH3 domains. Grb2 physically associates with the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor, Sos, through its SH3 domains. Upon activation of the EGFR, Shc binds the phosphorylated receptor and itself becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, leading to the recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane in close proximity to Ras, thus leading to Ras activation. Although the above model provides a molecular basis for our understanding of how RTKs lead to Ras activation, a number of important questions remain unanswered. First, the importance of Shc in EGFR activation of Ras is not clear, since the EGFR can bind Grb2 directly in lieu of a Shc intermediary. Second, the presence of two distinct phosphotyrosine binding domains in Shc (PTB versus SH2) suggests that Shc may link to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in different manners. Furthermore, the EGFR contains two binding sites for Shc, an SH2 binding site (Tyr1173) and a PTB binding site (Tyr1148), whereas other receptors, such as the nerve growth factor receptor, contain only a PTB binding site, suggesting that Shc proteins may function differently with different RTKs. However, the importance of direct binding of Shc to the EGFR is unclear given that mutant versions of the EGFR that lack the tyrosine autophosphorylation sites, and hence the Shc binding sites, are still mitogenic and capable of activating Shc, suggesting that abrogation of Shc interaction with the EGFR may not affect Ras activation by the receptor (8Gotoh N.

Finally, recent data have indicated that Shc may also function in Ras-independent pathways, suggesting that Shc may perform other functions besides regulation of the Ras/Erk pathway (11Damen J.E.

To define the importance of Shc in EGFR function, we assessed the ability of the isolated PTB and SH2 domains of ShcC to act as dominant negative inhibitors of EGFR signaling and transformation. We found that the SH2 domain inhibited EGFR activation of Erk-2 and Elk-1 and the growth of EGFR-transformed cells in soft agar in the absence of stable association with the receptor. In contrast, we found that the PTB domain formed a stable complex with the activated receptor yet did not significantly inhibit the activation of Erk-2 or Elk-1 by the receptor. These observations suggest that the ShcC SH2, rather than the PTB, mediates EGFR activation of Erk/Elk-1 and growth transformation. Furthermore, we suggest that the ShcC SH2 domain may promote this function via interaction with an as yet to be defined cellular component other than the EGFR. 293-T cells, hereafter referred to as 293 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Brian Howell, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), are a human embryonic kidney cell line expressing simian virus 40 T antigen. 293 cells and NIH/3T3 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Edison Liu, University of North Carolina) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin.

This fragment was subcloned into the pCRII vector (Stratagene), sequenced to check for mutations, and then subcloned into the BamHI site of pCGN-hyg as a BamHI–BglII fragment.

The 5′-PCR oligonucleotide for the SH2 domain contained a BamHI site, which, in conjuction with the BamHI site in pCRII, was used to subclone the SH2 domain into the BamHI site of pCGN-hyg. The pCGN Grb2 SH2 (kindly provided by Dr. Lawrence Quilliam, University of Indiana) encodes amino acids 56–155 of human Grb2, a sequence that corresponds to the isolated SH2 domain. The pCGN p120GAPSH2-SH3-SH2 construct (kindly provided by Dr. Geoff Clark, University of North Carolina) encodes amino acids 181–443 of human p120GAP. The construct contains a stop codon between the sequence encoding the HA epitope tag and the initiating Met of the GAP sequence; therefore, the resulting protein product is not recognized by the HA monoclonal antibody. The SrcY527F construct encodes a constitutively activated avian Src mutated at amino acid 527 and was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Howell. The NPM-ALK construct encodes the NPM-ALK translocation (23Bischoff D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Steve Morris (St. Jude Children's Research Hospital). Elk-1 activation was measured using a transient transcriptional activation assay essentially as described previously (24Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were transfected with constructs encoding a Gal-Elk fusion protein along with a Gal-luciferase reporter construct. In addition to these constructs, cells were cotransfected with the various dominant negative constructs. 293 cells (1.25 × 105 per well) were plated in six-well tissue culture plates. On the following day, a mixture of the following DNAs was transfected into each well of a six-well tissue culture plate by the calcium phosphate precipitation method: 2.5 μg of 5× Gal-luciferase, 0.5 μg of Gal-Elk, 1 μg of dominant negative and 1 μg of calf thymus DNA (Boehringer Mannheim). DNAs were mixed in H20 (112.5 μl/well). To the mixture was added dropwise with gentle mixing 12.5 μl of 2.5 mCaCl2. The DNA/CaCl2 mixture was then added dropwise with gentle agitation to an equal volume of 2× HEPES-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4·12H2O, pH 7.05). This mixture was allowed to incubate for 20–30 min and then added dropwise to the cells. After incubation of the cells with DNA for 4–5 h, the media were removed and replaced with fresh media. Cells were not glycerol-shocked. On the following day, the cells were serum-starved overnight in 0.1% fetal bovine serum. On the second day following transfection, cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 h at 37 °C or left untreated. Cells were then gently washed with phosphate-buffered saline, which had been warmed to 37 °C to prevent dislodging of the cells from the dish. Cells were then processed as described previously (24Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Lysates (5 μl) were read on a MONOLIGHT 2010 luminometer using enhanced chemiluminescent reagents (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). All assays were performed in duplicate, and the results presented are the average of at least three independent transfections. For analysis of Erk activity, 106 293 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture plate were transfected with an expression construct encoding an HA epitope-tagged Erk-2 along with the various dominant negative constructs. On the following day, cells were starved overnight in 0.1% fetal bovine serum. On the second day following transfection, cells were either stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml for 5 min) or left untreated. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline warmed to 37 °C and lysed in 1 ml of cold PLC-LB (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 100 mm sodium flouride) supplemented with 1 mmvanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Insoluble debris was pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 3–5 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of protein from each sample were then immunoprecipitated with a hemagglutinin antibody (Babco; 1:200 dilution). These immunoprecipitates were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P filters. The resulting filters were stained with Ponceau S to visualize the proteins and then cut just below the immunoglobulin heavy chain. This step decreases the background obtained from reactivity of the heavy chain protein with the secondary antibody. The filters were then probed with an antibody that recognizes the dually phosphorylated (phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine), activated form of MAPK (Anti-ACTIVE MAPK polyclonal antibody; Promega). The blots were stripped according to the manufacturer's protocol for the ECL kits and reprobed with an anti-HA monoclonal antibody to determine the amount of expressed HA-tagged Erk-2. The ratio of activated Erk-2 to total Erk-2 was determined by densitometric analysis. Results were standardized against the vector-transfected cells without EGF treatment. EGFR-transformed NIH/3T3 cells were generated by transfection of a murine leukemic virus-EGFR construct into cells and selection in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418. The resulting G418-resistant colonies were then passaged once as a population and allowed to grow to confluence. Transformed foci emerged within 10–14 days after passaging. The resulting transformed population of cells were further transfected with expression constructs either corresponding to vector alone or encoding ShcC SH2 or PTB, Grb2 SH2, or p120 Ras GAP SH2-SH3-SH2. Cells were selected in growth medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml hygromycin and 400 μg/ml G418, and the resulting drug-resistant colonies were pooled together and analyzed as described. To test for anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, 103 cells from each of the EGFR-transformed lines transfected with pCGN-hyg, pCGN-ShcC PTB, or pCGN ShcC SH2 were plated in triplicate in media containing 0.3% soft agar essentially as described (25Clark G. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Colonies were examined after 3–4 weeks. For the focus formation assays, NIH/3T3 cells (2.5 × 105) cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and on the following day were transfected with 0.5 μg of pSV2 NeuT plasmid along with 2 μg of the various dominant negatives. Each condition was tested in triplicate, and the results were averaged. EGFR-transformed cell lines expressing the various dominant negative proteins were lysed in PLC-LB as described above. Equal amounts of protein were fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were then cut into different portions and probed with antibodies directed against the EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), ShcA (Upstate Biotechnology), or the HA epitope (Babco). Reactive bands were visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For analysis of 293 cels, 1.25 × 106 cells/100-cm dish were transfected with constructs encoding the various dominant negative proteins (5 μg/dish). Cells were then starved overnight in 0.1% fetal bovine serum. On the following day, cells were stimulated with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min and then lysed in PLC-LB. Equal amounts of protein (1 mg) from each sample were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific to the human EGFR (Ab3, NeoMarkers, Inc.). Immunoprecipitates were then fractionated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transfected to Immobilon-P membranes, and probed with an antibody to ShcA (Upstate Biotechnology). Bands were visualized using the Enhanced Chemiluminescent kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Activation of the EGFR by EGF results in the recruitment of the Shc-Grb2-Sos complex to the activated receptor, thereby leading to Ras activation (7Bonfini L. Migliaccio E. Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 259-261Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activated Ras, in turn, activates the Raf-Erk cascade. Given the ability of ShcC to bind to the activated EGFR receptor through both its SH2 and PTB domains in vitro (2O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), we tested whether expression of either of these domains individually could inhibit the function of the EGFR (Fig.1). As shown in Fig. 1 A, each of the dominant negatives is expressed at similar levels in 293 cells. Since the GAP SH2-SH3-SH2 construct lacked an HA epitope, we performed Western blot analysis with a GAP-specific antiserum, which indicated that this protein was also expressed in these cells (data not shown). Next we tested if expression of either the ShcC PTB or SH2 domain could inhibit EGF induction of Erk activity. Since the p42/p44 Erks activate the transcription factor Elk-1 through phosphorylation of the transcriptional activation domain, we utilized a transient reporter assay in which we measure activation of a chimeric Gal4-Elk-1 transcription factor consisting of the Gal4 DNA binding domain linked to the Elk-1 transcriptional activation domain (24Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression of the ShcC SH2 domain blocked greater than 70% of the EGF-dependent activation of Elk-1, whereas expression of the PTB domain did not appear to significantly impact on Elk-1 activation by EGF (Fig. 1 B). The inhibition by the SH2 domain was dependent on phosphotyrosine binding as mutation of an Arg to Lys in the conserved FLVRES sequence abolished inhibition (data not shown). Expression of the SH2 domain of Grb2 also inhibited EGF activation of Elk-1 as previously shown (26Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), since Grb2 can interact with the activated EGFR, either directly or through Shc, via its SH2 domain (27Hashimoto Y. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Muroya K. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 869-875PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rozakis-Adcock M. McGlade J. Mbamalu G. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). In contrast, no inhibition of Elk-1 was seen when the isolated SH2-SH3-SH2 region of p120 Ras GAP was expressed (Fig.1 B) (29Medema R.H. DeLaat W.L. Martin G.A. McCormick F. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3425-3430Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), indicating that the inhibition seen with the ShcC SH2 was not a nonspecific property of all SH2 domains. Furthermore, neither the SH2 nor the PTB domains inhibited Elk-1 activation by activated Ha-Ras(61L), suggesting that inhibition occurs at a point upstream of Ras (Fig. 1 C). Also, this result demonstrates that the inhibition of EGFR signaling by the ShcC SH2 domain was not due to nonspecific toxicity. In addition, expression of neither the SH2 nor the PTB domain inhibited activation of Elk-1 by the NPM-ALK oncoprotein, a member of the insulin family of RTKs (23Bischoff D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 30Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T.

A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Together these results suggest that ShcC mediates EGFR activation of MAPKs primarily through its SH2 domain. Given that Elk-1 can be activated by a number of MAPK family members, including Erk, p38, and Jnk (32Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P.S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar, 33Whitmarsh A.J. Yang S.-H. Su M.S.-S. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2360-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar), we tested whether expression of the ShcC mutants could inhibit EGF-induced activation of Erk in 293 cells. Cells were transfected with an expression construct encoding an HA epitope-tagged MAPK/Erk2 protein (34Reuter C.W.M. Catling A.D. Weber M.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) along with expression constructs encoding the various dominant negative proteins. Following stimulation with EGF, HA epitope-tagged Erk-2 was immunoprecipitated and analyzed for activation using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes the dually phosphorylated, activated form of Erk-2. As shown in Fig. 2, stimulation of Erk-2 phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by expression of the SH2, but not PTB, domain of ShcC. As with the transient transcriptional assays, expression of the Grb2 SH2 domain also inhibited Erk-2 activation. In contrast to the transient assays, expression of the SH2-SH3-SH2 region of p120 Ras GAP inhibited EGF activation of Erk-2, suggesting that the activation of Elk-1 shown in Fig. 1 occurs through an Erk-independent pathway possibly through the activation of Jnk or p38. 2J. P. O'Bryan, G. Clark, and C. J. Der, manuscript in preparation. These results support the notion that the ShcC SH2 domain is a potent inhibitor of the EGF activation of Erks. We next determined if expression of the SH2 or PTB domains of ShcC inhibited aspects of EGFR-mediated transformation. To address this possibility, we isolated mass transfected populations of EGFR-transformed NIH/3T3 cells stably expressing the isolated ShcC SH2 or PTB domains (see Fig. 5). The growth rates on plastic of the resulting populations of cells were comparable with the control, vector-transfected population of EGFR-transformed cells. Thus, neither domain caused a significant inhibition of cell proliferation, suggesting that inhibition of Erk activation is separable from inhibition of growth. Similar results were seen in 293 cells in that expression of the ShcC dominant negative proteins did not appear to affect the proliferation of these cells (data not shown). Although expression of the SH2 or PTB domain did not cause a significant reversion in the transformed morphology of cells, we did observe an impairment in their ability to form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 3). Whereas control vector-transfected cells formed large colonies in soft agar, the SH2 domain-expressing cells showed a striking impairment in their ability to form colonies. Although PTB domain-expressing cells did form colonies, the efficiency was reduced (approximately 50%), and the colonies were smaller than those formed by the vector-transfected EGFR-transformed cells (Fig. 3 B). Taken together, these results suggest that the ShcC SH2 domain, and to a lesser degree the PTB domain, mediates EGFR signaling pathways that promote anchorage-independent growth but not morphologic transformation by the EGFR. Indeed, overexpression of Shc proteins was found to promote growth in soft agar with little effect on the morphology of NIH/3T3 cells (3Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar).Figure 3ShcC SH2 and PTB domains inhibit soft agar growth of EGFR-transformed NIH/3T3 cell lines. EGFR-transformed NIH/3T3 cells were stably transfected with empty vector or with PTB or SH2 expression constructs. Stable cell lines were then tested for their ability to form colonies in soft agar as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, colonies were stained and then counted. The result shown represents the average of three wells for each cell line. S.E. are indicated with bars. B, colonies formed by EGFR-transformed cells expressing the ShcC PTB domain are smaller than those formed by vector control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The relative importance of the SH2 and PTB domains in mediating growth transformation signaling pathways was also observed for another EGFR family member, the ErbB2/Neu RTK. Co-transfection of an expression construct encoding a constitutively activated and transforming mutant of Neu (21Youming X. Li K. Hung M.-C. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2409-2413PubMed Google Scholar) along with the SH2 encoding plasmid resulted in a 75% reduction in Neu focus-forming activity (Fig.4). In contrast, expression of the PTB domain resulted in only a 25% reduction in Neu focus-forming activity. This inhibition was specific, since co-expression of the ShcC SH2 or PTB domains did not significantly impair the focus-forming activity of an activated Src nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (SrcY527F) or the NPM-ALK transforming protein (data not shown), both of which have been shown to activate Shc proteins (23Bischoff D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 35McGlade J. Cheng A. Pelicci G. Pelicci P.G. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8869-8873Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The EGFR contains two binding sites for Shc proteins, Tyr1148 for the PTB domain and Tyr1173 for the SH2 domain (36Batzer A.G. R"

In previous studies, it was also reported that mAb 7E3 unexpectedly cross-reacted with the active conformation of αMβ2, induced on monocytes by inflammatory stimuli (14Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J.

These observations were recently independently confirmed with direct binding studies of mAb 7E3 to αMβ2 transfectants (16Simon D.I. Xu H. Ortlepp S. Rogers C. Rao N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), whereas a ∼200-amino acid-inserted “I” domain in αM (17Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar) was provisionally implicated in this cross-reactivity (18Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to reinvestigate the molecular basis of mAb 7E3 cross-reactivity with αMβ2 and its potential relevance to leukocyte adhesion, in vivo. We found that mAb 7E3 recognizes a discrete region in αM I domain (17Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar), which is critically involved in monocyte adherence to fibrinogenin vitro and in balloon-injured arteries, ex vivo. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were isolated from acid citrate dextrose-anticoagulated blood drawn from normal informed volunteers by Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) centrifugation and dextran sedimentation, as described (19Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PMN were suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) at a concentration of 1 × 106/ml. The monocytic cell line THP-1 (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) was maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium (BioWhittaker) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 2 mml-glutamine (Gemini), and 10−52-mercapthoethanol (Eastman Kodak Co.). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were isolated by collagenase treatment, maintained in medium 199 (BioWhittaker) plus 20% fetal bovine serum and endothelial cell growth factor, and plated onto gelatinized tissue culture plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA). Cells were used between passages 2 and 4. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the cDNA of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) were established and characterized previously (20Duperray A. Languino L.R. Plescia J.

Anti-β2 mAb IB4 was from ATCC. Nonbinding mAb 14E11 was used as a control. The map of the various αM I domain fragments used in these studies is shown in Fig. 1. For these experiments, the full-length αM cDNA was amplified by PCR in the presence of a forward oligonucleotide 5′-TGTCCTCAAGAGGATAGTGAC-3′ and four distinct reverse oligonucleotides 5′-AGAGAACAAGGTTTTGGAC-3′ (R1), 5′-CGTGGCCGTGTGTGTC-3′ (R2), 5′-CTCATATCCCAAGGGATCG-3′ (R3), and 5′-CGGCTTGGATGCGATG-3′ (R4). The fragment R1(−), lacking the amino-terminal R1 sequence Cys128–Ser172 (Fig. 1), was generated by PCR using forward and reverse oligonucleotides 5′-TTGATGCAGTACTCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-CGGCTTGGATGCGATG-3′, respectively. The αM I domain fragments B5 and B4 (Fig. 1) were generated with forward and reverse primers 5′-TTGATGCAGTACTCTGAAG-3′ and 5′-ATTCTTTCGGGCTCCGTTG-3′ (B5) and 5′-GCCTTTAAGATCCTAGTTGTC-3′ and 5′-CGGCTTGGATGCGATG-3′ (B4), respectively. Each forward primer contained a BamHI restriction site, whereas a XhoI site was added at the end of each reverse oligonucleotide. Amplification was carried out in a total volume of 100 μl with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gels, gel-purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, digested overnight with BamHI and XhoI, and directionally cloned in the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with transformation in the BL-21 Escherichia coli strain. Expression of recombinant proteins was carried out as described (18Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli cultures containing the various constructs were grown to A600 ∼0.5, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Calbiochem) and grown for 3 h at 37 °C with constant shaking at 225 rpm. Bacteria were centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and suspended in a lysis buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Calbiochem), and 1% Triton X-100. Samples were subjected to three cycles of sonication of 20 s each before centrifugation and dialysis in TBS, pH 7.4. Expression of the various I domain fragments of the expected molecular weight was confirmed in IPTG-induced bacterial lysates, but not in noninduced samples, by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Fibrinogen was purified from fresh frozen human plasma by glycine precipitation (19Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of fibrinogen with αMβ2 on stimulated monocytes and PMN has been described previously (7Altieri D.C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates of the various IPTG-induced αM I domain constructs, or a controlE. coli lysate, were diluted 1:50 in TBS, pH 8.0, and immobilized (100 μl/well) on plastic microtiter plates (Immulon-2, Dynatech Laboratories, Chantilly, VA) for 18 h at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 3% gelatin for 1 h at 37 °C, rinsed, and incubated with 20 μg/ml mAb 7E3, anti-β2 (CD18) mAb IB4, or control mAb 14E11 for 1 h at 37 °C. After washes in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20, binding of the primary antibodies was revealed by addition of biotin-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 1 h at 37 °C followed by streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase and determination of absorbance atA405 using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma). Peptides duplicating adjacent sequences in the αM R1 region (Fig. 1) R1.1 (G127CPQEDSDIAFLIDGSGSIIPHDF150), R1.2 (F150RRMKEFVSTVMEQLKKSKTLFS172), a control R1.1-scrambled peptide R1.1S (GILGFDEGPCIDHASPDISDFQIS), and a peptide reproducing the R1.1-homologous region (V107EDYPVDIYYLMDLSYSMKDDL128) in β3 integrin were synthesized and characterized by amino acid composition and mass spectrometry. The various peptides were dissolved at 5 μg/ml in carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, and immobilized onto plastic microtiter plates (100 μl/well) before determination of antibody binding, as described above. An additional unrelated factor X-derived peptide KDGLGEYG was used as a control. PMN or THP-1 cells were metabolically labeled with 300 μCi of 51CrNaO4 (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 h at 37 °C, washed, and suspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 at 1 × 106/ml. Two-hundred-μl aliquots of cell suspension were stimulated with 1 μm fMLP (Sigma), treated with the various mAbs at 20 μg/ml for 15 min at 22 °C, and further incubated with or without fibrinogen (200 μg/ml) in 2.5 mm CaCl2 for 20 min at 22 °C. Cells were added to monolayers of HUVEC or ICAM-1 transfectants for 45 min at 22 °C, and after washes attached cells were solubilized in 20% SDS with determination of radioactivity in a scintillation β-counter. The number of attached cells was calculated by dividing the counts/min observed by the counts/min/cell (21Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Alternatively, HUVEC monolayers were preincubated with mAbs IB4, 7E3, or control mAb 14E11 for 30 min at 22 °C, washed, and mixed with 51Cr-labeled, fMLP-stimulated THP-1 cells before determination of fibrinogen-dependent intercellular bridging, as described above. In other experiments, microtiter wells were coated with human or rabbit (Sigma) fibrinogen at 10 μg/ml for 18 h at 4 °C and blocked with 3% gelatin for 30 min at 37 °C. Wells were incubated with fMLP-stimulated 51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells (1 × 106/ml) preincubated with 20 μg/ml mAbs 7E3, IB4, or control mAb 14E11 for 10 min at 22 °C with determination of cell adhesion after a 45-min incubation at 22 °C. Adult New Zealand White rabbits (3–5 kg weight) were given free access to water and rabbit chow and were housed in a facility with alternating light and dark cycles. Animal care complied with the “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (National Society for Medical Research) and the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (NIH Publication No. 80–23, revised 1985). The Harvard Medical Area Standing Committee on Animals approved the experimental protocol. For surgical procedures, animals were anesthetized with ketamine (25 mg/kg, KetalarTM, Parke-Davis) and xylazine (5 mg/kg, Rompun™, Mobay, Shawnee, KS) administered by intramuscular injection, supplemented with intravenous doses of the mixture as needed. The iliofemoral arterial segment was exposed bilaterally via extended groin incisions, and all side branches proximal to the femoral bifurcation were ligated to create an isolated segment (22Conte M.S. Birinyi T. Fallon J. Gold H.K. Whittemore A.D. Mulligan R.C. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2161-2169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The superficial femoral artery was then cannulated, and a 2-French Fogarty balloon embolectomy catheter (American Edwards, Anasco, Puerto Rico) was inserted. The catheter tip was passed into the terminal aorta and the balloon inflated and withdrawn three times to denude the vessel. After removal of the catheter, the superior femoral artery was ligated and antegrade flow re-established via the deep femoral branch. Wounds were closed surgically and the animals allowed to recover. At sacrifice (5–6 days after balloon injury) animals were re-anesthetized as described and systemically heparinized with a 1000-unit intravenous bolus. The groin wounds were reopened and patency of the femoral arteries assessed by direct inspection. The animals were then euthanized with an intravenous overdose of sodium pentobarbital. The abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava were cannulated and the distal arterial tree perfused at 80–120 mm Hg with 500 ml of heparinized (10 units/ml) lactated Ringer's solution (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, IL) with continuous venous drainage. The femoral arteries were re-cannulated with 20-gauge stainless steel catheters and the entire aortofemoral arterial segment excised and placed into sterile PBS. The freshly excised arterial segments were flushed gently with PBS prewarmed to 37 °C, and a microvascular clamp was placed at the origin of each external iliac artery. 51Cr-Labeled THP-1 cells (107/ml) were stimulated with 1 μm fMLP in the presence of 2.5 mm CaCl2, equilibrated with control mAb 14E11 or mAb 7E3 (10–25 μg/ml) for 30 min at 22 °C, and infused to fill each vessel segment. Paired arteries in each case were treated with mAb 7E3 versus control mAb 14E11. The external surface of the filled arteries was rinsed copiously with PBS and the vessels placed in PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. At the end of the incubation, a 5-mm segment of proximal aorta (not exposed to THP-1 cells intraluminally) was excised for measurement of background counts. The clamps were then removed, and each vessel was flushed gently with 3 ml of PBS at 1 ml/min by timed hand injection. The external surface was again rinsed and 5-mm segments cut (two from each iliofemoral segment) for scintillation counting. Segments of the remaining tissue were embedded in optimal cutting temperature compound (Bayer, West Haven, CT) and snap-frozen in 2-methylbutane cooled in liquid nitrogen for immunohistochemical analysis. Tissue was prepared for scintillation counting by carefully mincing each specimen and solubilizing in 1% Triton X-100, 10% SDS overnight at 22 °C. The following day an equal volume of scintillant was added, and radioactivity was determined in a scintillation counter. Snap-frozen tissue was cut into 6-μm-thick cross-sections and adhered to glass slides coated with 0.25% gelatin and 0.025% chromium potassium sulfate (CrK(SO4)2, Sigma). Tissue was fixed in acetone at −20 °C for 10 min, quenched in 3% H2O2, and blocked with 10% normal horse serum. Following each step, slides were washed with TBS containing 135 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 2.6 mm KCl, pH 7.4, plus 1% fetal bovine serum. A mouse anti-fibrinogen antibody characterized in previous studies (19Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was applied for 1 h at 22 °C, followed by a secondary biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories Inc. Burlingame, CA) for 2 h at 22 °C. Negative controls were prepared in the absence of primary antibody or with nonbinding isotype control (IgG1). Sections were incubated with an avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC kit, Vector) followed by 3-amino-9-carbazole. Slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma) followed by 30% NH3OH. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, mAb 7E3 bound all recombinant I domain fragments containing the αM sequence Cys128–Pro291 (Fig.2 A). The minimal αM fragment reacting with mAb 7E3 contained the R1 sequence Cys128–Ser172 (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with these findings, mAb 7E3 failed to react with three carboxyl terminus αM I domain fragments lacking the R1 region and designated R1(−) (Leu173–Pro291), B5 (Leu173–Asn232), and B4 (Ala233–Pro291), or with control, non-IPTG-induced, bacterial lysate (Fig. 2 A). In peptide mapping experiments, mAb 7E3 bound the R1.1 sequence G127CPQEDSDIAFLIDGSGSIIPHDF150 corresponding to the amino-terminal half of the R1 region in αM I domain, whereas a peptide with the R1.1 sequence in scrambled order (R1.1S) was not recognized by mAb 7E3 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, synthetic peptides duplicating the adjacent I domain region F150RRMKEFVSTVMEQLKKSKTLFS172 (R1.2), the R1.1-homologous sequence V107EDYPVDIYYLMDLSYSMKDDL128 in β3 integrin (Beta3), or an unrelated factor X sequence KDGLGEYG (control) did not associate with mAb 7E3 (Fig.2 B). In control experiments, mAb 14E11 or anti-β2 (CD18) mAb IB4 did not recognize any αM I domain fragments and did not associate with β2-, β3-, or factor X-derived peptides in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Fig. 2, A andB). The effect of mAb 7E3 on αMβ2 recognition of ICAM-1 (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar) was first investigated. Preincubation of fMLP-stimulated PMN or monocytic THP-1 with mAb 7E3 or control mAb 14E11 did not reduce the attachment of these cells to monolayers of resting HUVEC or ICAM-1 transfectants (Fig. 3). In contrast, anti-β2 mAb IB4 nearly completely abrogated PMN adhesion to HUVEC or ICAM-1 transfectants, and significantly inhibited THP-1 cell attachment to either cell type, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 3). A potential effect of mAb 7E3 on αMβ2recognition of fibrinogen (7Altieri D.C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was next investigated. In adhesion assays, mAb 7E3 completely inhibited the attachment of fMLP-stimulated THP-1 cells to immobilized human or rabbit fibrinogen (Fig.4 A). Similar results were obtained with anti-β2 mAb IB4, whereas control mAb 14E11 was ineffective (Fig. 4 A). The effect of mAb 7E3 on fibrinogen-dependent leukocyte-endothelium bridging (21Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) was also investigated. Consistent with previous observations (21Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), fibrinogen enhanced the adhesion of fMLP-stimulated PMN or THP-1 cells to HUVEC or ICAM-1 transfectants by 2–4.4-fold (Fig. 4 B, legend), as compared with control incubation reactions in the absence of fibrinogen (Fig. 3). Under these experimental conditions, mAb 7E3 inhibited the fibrinogen-dependent enhancement of PMN or THP-1 cell adhesion to HUVEC or ICAM-1 transfectants (Fig.4 B). In contrast, fibrinogen-independent attachment of PMN or THP-1 cells to either cell type was unaffected by mAb 7E3 (Fig.4 B, legend). In control experiments, anti-β2mAb IB4 inhibited fibrinogen-dependent and –independent intercellular adhesion, whereas control mAb 14E11 was ineffective (Fig.4 B). Finally, preincubation of HUVEC monolayers with mAb 7E3 followed by washes and addition of 51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells failed to reduce fibrinogen-dependent intercellular bridging, thus ruling out a potential role of HUVEC αvβ3 recognition of fibrinogen in this interaction, and in agreement with previous observations (21Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Balloon-mediated injury of external iliac arteries in rabbits resulted in prominent attachment of fMLP-stimulated,51Cr-labeled THP-1 cells to the de-endothelialized injured vessel, as compared with noninjured arteries (Fig.5 and data not shown). Under these experimental conditions, equilibration of THP-1 cells with mAb 7E3ex vivo nearly completely inhibited the attachment of these cells to balloon-injured vessels, whereas control mAb 14E11 was ineffective (Fig. 5). In four of four animals, mAb 7E3 inhibited monocyte THP-1 cell adhesion to balloon-injured vessels by 53.6 ± 10.6% at 10 μg/ml and by 85.9 ± 3.9% at 25 μg/ml (n = 2). In immunohistochemical analysis, an anti-fibrinogen antibody strongly reacted with the luminal and medial aspects of the balloon-injured rabbit iliac arteries (Fig.6), whereas no specific fibrinogen staining was observed in noninjured arteries (not shown). In control experiments, no specific staining of injured vessels was observed in the absence of a primary antibody, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 6).Figure 6Immunohistochemical deposition of fibrinogen on balloon-injured vessels. The experimental conditions are essentially the same as described in the legend to Fig. 5, except that balloon-injured iliac arteries were processed for immunohistochemistry with an anti-fibrinogen antibody. a, control negative staining in the absence of primary antibody. b andc, immunoreactivity of the anti-fibrinogen antibody with luminal (arrows) and medial aspects of the denuded vessels.

J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 1467-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), binds a discrete region of αM I domain and inhibits fibrinogen-mediated leukocyte adhesion in vitro, and in balloon-injured arteries of rabbits, ex vivo. Although of paramount importance for normal hemostasis (23Coller B.S. Seligsohn U. Peretz H. Newman P.J. Semin. Hematol. 1994; 31: 301-311PubMed Google Scholar), platelet aggregation mechanisms maintained by αIIbβ3may precipitate thrombus formation and acute ischemic cardiovascular emergencies (5Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2893) Google Scholar, 6Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Eng. J. Med. 1992; 326: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Among integrin antagonists capable of targeting platelet adherence mechanisms, anti-αIIbβ3mAb 7E3 significantly reduced mortality and emergency procedures in patients undergoing acute coronary intervention (12The EPIC Investigators N. Engl. J. Med. 1994; 330: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (2672) Google Scholar, 13The EPIC Investigators N. Eng. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1689-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1968) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, it was also shown that mAb 7E3 possessed an unusual pattern of antigen recognition, which included, in addition to αIIbβ3, the related integrin αvβ3 (9Coller B.S. Anderson K. Weisman H.F. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and the active form of the leukocyte integrin αMβ2 (14Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 2656-2660PubMed Google Scholar, 16Simon D.I. Xu H. Ortlepp S. Rogers C. Rao N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This was potentially relevant to the beneficial effect of mAb 7E3 in vivo, because inhibition of αvβ3reduced neointimal hyperplasia in models of vascular injury (24Matsuno H. Stassen J.M. Vermylen J. Deckmyn H. Circulation. 1994; 90: 2203-2206Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and αMβ2-dependent leukocyte adherence contributed to monocyte recruitment and reperfusion injury (8Vedder N.B. Winn R.K. Rice C.L. Chi E.Y. Arfors K.E. Harlan J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2643-2646Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here, mAb 7E3 bound a cross-reacting epitope in the amino-terminal R1 region Cys128–Ser172 of αMI-domain, which was further narrowed to the R1.1 peptide sequence G127CPQEDSDIAFLIDGSGSIIPHDF150. The most salient feature of this motif is the presence of the amino acids Asp140–Ser142–Ser144, which comprise the first group of oxygenated residues of the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) on αM I domain (17Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Experimental evidence obtained with homology models, mutagenesis, and divalent ion binding studies suggests that a MIDAS-like motif containing the DXSXS motif, in which X is a nonconserved amino acid, is structurally and functionally present in all integrin β subunits (25Tozer E.C.

Intriguingly, mAbs raised against this region in β3-inhibited fibrinogen binding to the receptor (29Andrieux A. Rabiet M.-J. Chapel A. Concord E. Marguerie G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14202-14207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a synthetic peptide duplicating the MIDAS-like motif bound ligand and divalent ions (30D'Souza S.E. Haas T.A. Piotrowicz R.S. Byers-Ward V. McGrath D.E. Soule H.R. Cierniewski C. Plow E.F. Smith J.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, a β3-derived peptide containing the MIDAS homology motif failed to associate with mAb 7E3. This is consistent with the inability of mAb 7E3 to recognize the isolated β3 subunit (31Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) and suggests that conformational and/or divalent ion-dependent changes in αIIbβ3 are required to form a high affinity antibody binding interface (17Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Whether or not mAb 7E3 recognizes MIDAS-like structures in other integrin β subunits is currently not known. However the data presented here suggest that the antigenic accessibility of this shared motif may be modulated by receptor-specific conformational changes and/or the requirement of additional contact site(s) in the α/β heterodimer. This complex pattern of multiple integrin recognition may not be unique of mAb 7E3, because other function blocking anti-αIIbβ3mAbs, i.e. 25E11, have been shown to cross-react with αMβ2 (32De Nichilo M.O. Shafren D.R. Carter W.M. Berndt M.C. Burns G.F. Boyd A.W. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 284-288PubMed Google Scholar). The next question addressed by this study was the potential physiologic relevance of mAb 7E3 cross-reactivity with αMβ2. Consistent with the critical role of αM I domain in ligand binding (17Lee J.-O. Rieu P. Arnaout M.A. Liddington R. Cell. 1995; 80: 631-638Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 18Zhou L. Lee D.H.S. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25866-25871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), engagement of the mAb 7E3 cross-reacting epitope suppressed the receptor recognition of fibrinogen, in agreement with recent observations (16Simon D.I. Xu H. Ortlepp S. Rogers C. Rao N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This resulted in inhibition of leukocyte adherence to immobilized fibrinogen and of fibrinogen-dependent leukocyte-endothelium bridging (21Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C. Cell. 1993; 73: 1423-1434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), indistinguishably from bona fide anti-β2 integrin mAb IB4. In contrast, at variance with a recent study (16Simon D.I. Xu H. Ortlepp S. Rogers C. Rao N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 528-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), mAb 7E3 failed to reduce the αMβ2 recognition of ICAM-1 (1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8938) Google Scholar, 3Arnaout M.A. Blood. 1990; 75: 1037-1050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although differences in protocol may account for this discrepancy, experimental evidence with epitope-mapped mAbs (33Diamond M.S. Garcia-Aguilar J. Bickford J.K. Corbi A.L. Springer T.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), and peptide inhibition studies (35Mesri M. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 744-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggests that the ICAM-1- and fibrinogen-binding sites on αM I domain are physically distinct and nonoverlapping. An in vivo model of vascular damage further underscored the relevance of mAb 7E3 targeting of monocyte-fibrinogen interaction. In these studies, balloon-mediated injury of the iliofemoral arteries in rabbits resulted in prominent deposition of fibrinogen as detected by immunohistochemistry and in agreement with previous studies (36Hatton M.W. Southward S.M. Ross-Ouellet B. DeReske M. Blajchman M.A. Richardson M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition to promoting increased procoagulant activity (37Frebelius S. Isaksson S. Swedenborg J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Previously, we demonstrated that both the cytoplasmic tail (CT) and transmembrane (TM) domains of Ii were sufficient for this targeting and that the CT contains two di-leucine signals, 3DQRDLI8 and12EQLPML17 (Odorizzi, C. G., Trowbridge, I. S., Xue, L., Hopkins, C. R., Davis, C. D., and Collawn, J. F. (1994) J. Cell Biol. 126, 317–330). In the present study, we examined the relationship between signals required for endocytosis and those required for lysosomal targeting by analyzing Ii-transferrin receptor chimeras in quantitative transport assays. Analysis of the Ii CT signals indicates that although3DQRDLI8 is necessary and sufficient for endocytosis, either di-leucine signal is sufficient for lysosomal targeting. Deletions between the two signals reduced endocytosis without affecting lysosomal targeting. Transplantation of the DQRDLI sequence in place of the EQLPML signal produced a chimera that trafficked normally, suggesting that this di-leucine sequence coded for an independent structural motif. Structure-function analysis of the Ii TM region showed that when Ii TM residues 11–19 and 20–29 were individually substituted for the corresponding regions in the wild-type transferrin receptor, lysosomal targeting was dramatically enhanced, whereas endocytosis remained unchanged. Our results therefore demonstrate that the structural requirements for Ii endocytosis and lysosomal targeting are different."

In order to investigate a role for phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), we used targeted disruption of the Plcg1 gene in the mouse to develop Plcg1 +/+ andPlcg1 −/− cell lines. Plcg1 +/+ MEFs treated with PDGF showed a time- and dose-dependent increase in the production of total inositol phosphates that was substantially reduced inPlcg1 −/− cells. Plcg1 +/+ cells also showed a PDGF-induced increase in PLD activity that had a similar dose dependence to the PLC response but was down-regulated after 15 min. Phospholipase D activity, however, was markedly reduced in Plcg1 −/−cells. The PDGF-induced inositol phosphate formation and the PLD activity that remained in the Plcg1 −/− cells could be attributed to the presence of phospholipase C-γ2 (PLC-γ2) in the Plcg1 −/− cells. The PLC-γ2 expressed in the Plcg1 −/− cells was phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to PDGF treatment, and a small but significant fraction of the Plcg1 −/− cells showed Ca2+ mobilization in response to PDGF, suggesting that the PLC-γ2 expressed in the Plcg1 −/− cells was activated in response to PDGF. The inhibition of PDGF-induced phospholipid hydrolysis in Plcg1 −/− cells was not due to differences in the level of PDGF receptor or in the ability of PDGF to cause autophosphorylation of the receptor. Upon treatment of the Plcg1 −/− cells with oleoylacetylglycerol and the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin to mimic the effect of PLC-γ1, PLD activity was restored. The targeted disruption ofPlcg1 did not result in universal changes in the cell signaling pathways of Plcg1 −/− cells, because the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase was similar inPlcg1 +/+ and Plcg1 −/−cells. Because increased plasma membrane ruffles occurred in bothPlcg1 +/+ and Plcg1 −/−cells following PDGF treatment, it is possible neither PLC nor PLD are necessary for this growth factor response. In summary, these data indicate that PLC-γ is required for growth factor-induced activation of PLD in MEFs.

Diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C (PKC), whereas IP3 liberates Ca2+ from stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Carpenter G.

In addition, through the actions of PA phosphohydrolase and a specific phospholipase A2, PA can be converted to DAG and the signaling molecule lysophosphatidic acid, respectively (11Wakelam M.J.O.

Furthermore, some studies have indicated that PLD can be activated by certain agonists in the absence of detectable PIP2 hydrolysis. For example, in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, studies with neomycin indicate that activation of PLD by purinergic agonists is independent of PLC-γ activity (20Balboa M.A. Firestein B.L. Godson C. Bell K.S. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In certain fibroblasts, PLD activation by epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been reported to occur in the absence of measurable PIP2 breakdown (21Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts and TRMP cells, activation of PLC-γ1 is necessary for stimulation of PLD activity by PDGF (22Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we used homologous recombination to selectively disrupt the Plcg1gene encoding PLC-γ1 in mice (23Ji Q.-S. Winnier G.E. Niswender K.D. Horstman D. Wisdom R. Magnuson M.A. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2999-3003Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although this mutation was lethal, immortal mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were produced fromPlcg1 +/+ and Plcg1 −/−embryos. We have now used these cells to study PDGF-induced PLD activity. The results indicate that PLC-γ1 activity is required for PDGF-induced PLD activation.DISCUSSIONGrowth factors stimulate the PLD-induced hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) to PA and choline in a variety of cell types (30Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The exact pathway by which this occurs is not clear. A number of mechanisms of activation have been proposed involving protein tyrosine kinases, PKC, Ca2+, and GTP-binding proteins (36Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15579-15582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In an elegant study seeking to define a role for PLC-γ1 in PDGF-induced PLD activation, Yeo et al. (22Yeo E.-J. Kazlauskas A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27823-27826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) measured PLD activity in TRMP cells (a kidney epithelial cell line) expressing wild type PDGF receptors or various tyrosine mutated PDGF receptors. They reported that PDGF had no effect on PLD activity in PDGFR kinase-deficient TRMP cells, but the PDGF-induced PLD activity was restored in cells containing a mutant PDGFR that was able to bind PLC-γ1 but not other signaling proteins. Furthermore, they showed that a mutant PDGFR that could not activate PLC-γ1 was unable to activate PLD. These data suggest that PLC-γ1 is necessary and sufficient for PDGF-induced PLD activity. However, the experiments were conducted with a cell line that normally lacked the PDGFR (37Kazlauskas A. Durden D.L. Cooper J.A. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Further evidence for a role of PLC-γ in the activation of PLD came from a study in which PLC-γ1 was overexpressed in NIH3T3 cells. Lee et al. (38Lee Y.H. Kim H.S. Pai J.-K. Ryu S.H. Suh P.-G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26842-26847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that PDGF-induced PLD activity was directly related to the level of PLC-γ1 expressed in the cells, and that down-regulation of PKC by PMA pretreatment completely blocked PLD activation. These data again suggest PLD lies downstream of PLC-γ1 and PKC.On the other hand, there are data that show agonist-induced PC hydrolysis or PLD activation in the absence of detectable PIP2 breakdown (16Ahmed A. Plevin R. Shoaibi M.A. Fountain S.A. Ferriani R.A. Smith S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C206-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10511-10516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cook and Wakelam (21Cook S.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed EGF stimulation of PLD activity in Swiss 3T3 cells in the absence of measurable PIP2 hydrolysis and in the presence of a PKC inhibitor, although it was later found that EGF induced a small increase in InsPx in these cells and that a PKC inhibitor did decrease the PLD response (12Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). When these reports are coupled with the frequent finding that PKC inhibitors produce only partial inhibition of the actions of growth factors and other agonists on PLD (10Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1212: 26-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 30Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), questions remain about the extent of the contribution of PIP2 hydrolysis and PKC to the regulation of PLD.The data presented strongly suggest that PLC-γ1 is required for PLD activation by PDGF. The PLD response of TVI-targetedPlcg1 +/+ cells to EGF and PDGF is small, and the response is inhibited in TVI-targeted Plcg1 −/−cells (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the PDGF-induced PLD response of TVII-targeted Plcg1 +/+ cells is robust and is greatly inhibited in TVII-targeted Plcg1 −/−cells (Fig. 1). A small but reproducible, increase in PLD activity with EGF and a contrasting robust PLD response to PDGF have been seen in a variety of cell types, including Rat1 and Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (12Yeo E.-J. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3980-3988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,39Hess J.A. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The present study thus adds to earlier data reporting differences in the signal transduction pathways for the two growth factors (40Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Schaffhausen B. Pallas D.C. White M.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3283-3289Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In Plcg1 +/+cells, PDGF elicits an increase in the production of total inositol phosphates in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 2). In Plcg1 −/− cells, PDGF caused a small increase in inositol phosphate production (Fig. 2). Our data suggest that the small increase in inositol phosphate production inPlcg1 −/− cells is due to the expression of PLC-γ2 in the Plcg1 −/− cells (Fig.4 A). Treatment of Plcg1 −/− cells with PDGF resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 (Fig.4 B). PDGF treatment of rat-2 cells overexpressing PLC-γ2 increases the tyrosine phosphorylation and the in vivoactivity of PLC-γ2 (29Sultzman L. Ellis C. Lin L.-L. Pawson T. Knopf J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2018-2025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, treatment ofPlcg1 −/− cells with PDGF resulted in the mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in a small population of the cells. Over-expression of PLC-γ2 in NIH3T3 cells also enhances PDGF-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ (43Totzke F. Hug H. Fitzke E. Marme D. Dieter P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Thus, our data suggest that the disruption of Plcg1 resulted in a compensatory up-regulation of PLC-γ2 and that this isoform, which is closely related to PLC-γ1, is responsible for the increase in InsPx formation (Fig. 2), PLD activity (Fig. 3), and intracellular Ca2+ mobilization seen inPlcg1 −/− cells upon treatment with PDGF.If PLC-γ1 acts upstream of PLD in the PDGF-induced PLD-activation pathway, then PLD activity should be inhibited inPlcg1 −/− cells. Furthermore, there should be a correlation between PLC and PLD activities. Treatment ofPlcg1 +/+ cells with PDGF results in a dose-dependent increase in PtdBut formation that mirrors the dose-response curve for PDGF-induced InsPx production in Plcg1 +/+ (Fig. 3 A; cf.Fig. 2 A). The PLD response to PDGF treatment inPlcg1 −/− cells is inhibited in parallel with the decrease in the PLC response (Fig. 3 A; cf.Fig. 2 A). However, the PDGF-induced PLD response reached a maximum at 15 min in the Plcg1 +/+ or thePlcg1 −/− cells, at which time the production of PtdBut ceased (Fig. 3 B). This is in contrast to the PDGF-induced InsPx production, which was still increasing at 60 min. This same pattern of phosphatidylalcohol and inositol phosphate production was reported in NIH3T3γ-1 cells, which overexpress PLC-γ1 and in which phosphatidylethanol production reached a maximum at 10 min in response to PDGF, whereas InsPx production was still increasing at 30 min (44Kim B.Y. Ahn S.C. Kang D.O. Ko H.R. Oh W.K. Lee H.S. Mheen T.I. Rho H.M. Ahn J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1311: 33-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Exploration of the reasons for the cessation of PtdBut formation is outside the scope of the present study, but it is possible that activation of PLC and the consequent activation of PKC and mobilization of Ca2+ could have an initial stimulatory effect on PLD followed by an inhibitory action, due perhaps to phosphorylation of PLD or an inhibitory protein. Phosphorylation of PLD by PKC has recently been reported to inhibit its activity (45Min D.S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (87) Google Scholar).The inhibition of PDGF-induced PLD activity inPlcg1 −/− cannot be attributed to a decreased level of PDGF receptors in the Plcg1 −/− cells (data not shown) or to a defect in PDGF-induced autophosphorylation (Fig. 5). In fact, the autophosphorylation of the receptor occurred more rapidly in the Plcg1 −/− cells as compared with the Plcg1 +/+ cells, reaching a maximum level at 5 min and decreasing toward basal level by 60 min, but this difference in autophosphorylation cannot account for the decreased PDGF-induced PLD activity seen in the Plcg1 −/−cells. Another possible explanation is that PKC is deficient in thePlcg1 −/− cells. However, this does not seem to be the case because treatment of Plcg1 +/+ andPlcg1 −/− cells with phorbol ester, an activator of PKC, results in a similar dose-dependent activation of PLD (data not shown).In cells treated with growth factors, activated PLC-γ1 hydrolyzes PIP2 to form IP3 and DAG, resulting in an increase in intracellular Ca2+ and the activation of PKC. Treatment of Plcg1 −/− cells with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin and the cell-permeable DAG analogue OAG resulted in a PLD response that was similar to that inPlcg1 +/+ cells and slightly greater than the PLD response induced by PDGF (Fig. 6). Thus, the addition of PLC-γ1 activation products to the Plcg1 −/− cells reconstituted the PDGF-induced PLD response in thePlcg1 −/− cells to the level seen in the wild type cells. These data suggest that the PLC-γ1 activation products are sufficient to completely restore the PDGF-induced PLD response lost in the Plcg1 −/− upon disruption of PLC-γ1 in these cells. Furthermore, these results and those with phorbol ester prove that PLD is not deficient in thePlcg1 −/− cells.Growth factor treatment of cells results in a mitogenic response that is mediated by the MAP kinase. The growth factor-induced activation of MAP kinase involves the sequential activation of Ras, MEK kinase, and MEK (31Malarkey K. Belham C.M. Graham P.A. Mclees A. Scott P.H. Plevin R. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 361-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In a 3T3 cell line derivative, NR6 cells, EGF-stimulated MAP kinase activity was not affected by the inhibition of PLC with U73122 (32Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and data from Ji et al. (26Ji Q.-S. Ermini S. Baulida J. Sun F.-L. Carpenter G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 749-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that EGF-induced activation of MAP kinase in the TVI-targetedPlcg1 +/+ and Plcg1 −/−cells was similar. Thus, these findings indicate that PLC-γ1 is not involved in the phosphorylation and activation of MAP kinase by growth factors. We also observed PDGF-induced phosphorylation of MAP kinase inPlcg1 +/+ and Plcg1 −/−cells (Fig. 7), indicating that the targeted gene disruption of PLC-γ1 did not result in global changes to PDGF-signaling pathways.Data from two recent reports suggest a role for PA in the polymerization of actin stress fibers (33Cross M.J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Actin stress fibers are a major component of the cytoskeleton in fibroblasts, where actin filaments can exist in three types of structures, including actin stress fibers, the cortical actin network, and cell surface protrusions, such as membrane ruffles and filopodia (35Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Ha and Exton (34Ha K.-S. Exton J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1789-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) reported that treatment of IIC9 fibroblasts with thrombin, PLD from Streptomyces chromofuscus, or exogenous PA resulted in actin stress fiber formation. In porcine aortic endothelial cells, lysophosphatidic acid treatment activated PLD, resulting in the formation of PA, in the apparent absence of the formation of other lipid second messengers (33Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysophosphatidic acid, like exogenously added PA, also stimulated the formation of actin stress fibers (33Cross M.J. Roberts S. Ridley A.J. Hodgkin M.N. Stewart A. Claesson-Welsh L. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 588-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these observations generally support a role for PLD in stress fiber formation, it is possible that signals evoked by the exogenous PLD and PA are different from those elicited by activation of endogenous PLD (46van Dijk M.C.M.

For example, they could generate lysophosphatidic acid, which could induce actin polymerization by a different mechanism.In Swiss 3T3 cells, PDGF has been shown to induce the formation of membrane ruffles (35Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar), and we therefore utilized thePlcg1 −/− cells to examine the role of PLD in this effect. In Plcg1 −/− cells, 5 ng/ml PDGF induced membrane ruffles similar to those induced inPlcg1 +/+ cells (Fig. 8), even though activation of PLD was significantly inhibited (Fig. 2 B). Thus, it appears that PLD and PLC activity may not be necessary for the PDGF-induced formation of membrane ruffles. It seems unlikely that the small level of PLC-γ2, inositol phosphate formation, and Ca2+ mobilization would be sufficient to provoke maximal ruffling response.In summary, the present data suggest that in mouse embryo fibroblasts, PLC-γ1 activation is necessary for the PDGF-induced activation of PLD. However, caution should be exercised in extrapolating the findings to other agonists or cell types. We are currently investigating a role for PLC-γ1 in the activation of PLD by various other agonists, including those that activate heterotrimeric G-proteins.

Its expression significantly enhances low density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake via the LDL receptor pathway. A specific interaction between LPL, a homologous molecule to HL, and apoB has been described (Choi, S. Y., Sivaram, P., Walker, D. E., Curtiss, L. K., Gretch, D. G., Sturley, S. L., Attie, A. D., Deckelbaum, R. J., and Goldberg, I. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 8081–8086). The present studies tested the hypothesis that HL enhances the uptake of lipoproteins by a specific interaction of HL with apoB. On a ligand blot, HL bound to apoB26, 48, and 100 but not to apoE or apoAI. HL binding to LDL in a plate assay with LDL-coated plates was significantly greater than to bovine serum albumin-coated plates. Neither heat denatured HL nor bacterial fusion protein of HL bound to LDL in the plate assays. 125I-LDL bound to HL-saturated heparin-agarose gel with a Kdof 52 nm, and somewhat surprisingly, this binding was not inhibited by excess LPL. In cell culture experiments HL enhanced the uptake of 125I-LDL at both 4 and 37 °C. The enhanced binding and uptake of LDL was significantly inhibited by monoclonal anti-apoB antibodies. In contrast to LPL, both amino- and carboxyl-terminal antibodies blocked the apoB interaction with HL to the same extent. Thus, we conclude that there is a unique interaction between HL and apoB that facilitates the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins by cells where HL is present.

Hepatic lipase is synthesized in hepatic parenchymal cells and functions primarily as an endothelial bound enzyme within the liver sinusoids (1Jensen G.L. Baly D.L. Brannon P.M. Bensadoun A. J. Biol.

Biochem J. 1981; 196: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The enzyme hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids of the circulating lipoproteins; thus, it is involved in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseapoapolipoproteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyHLhepatic lipase.1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseapoapolipoproteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyHLhepatic lipase. converting the HDL2 fraction to HDL3 and in the conversion of intermediate density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein (LDL).Several lines of evidence now suggest that hepatic lipase may play another role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In vivo inhibition of hepatic lipase, with an antibody to the protein, delays the clearance of chylomicron remnants (5de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and patients with hepatic lipase deficiency often have an accumulation of remnant-like lipoproteins in the plasma. Overexpression of hepatic lipase in transgenic rabbits results in reduced levels of plasma HDL and intermediate density lipoprotein (6Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Gel filtration studies of hepatic lipase in post-heparin plasma revealed that hepatic lipase is associated with lipoproteins that overlap the elution of small LDL (7Goldberg I.J. Kandel J.J. Blum C.B. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated by this laboratory (8Choi S.Y. Komaromy M.C. Chen J. Fong L.G. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 848-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that hepatic lipase significantly enhanced LDL uptake via the LDL receptor pathway in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with rat hepatic lipase cDNA. The amount of the LDL receptor was virtually identical in the transfected cells as compared with the control cells; thus, the presence of hepatic lipase enhanced the affinity of the lipoprotein particle for the LDL receptor. Recently, Krapp et al. (9Krapp A. Ahlem S. Kersting S. Hua Y. Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that hepatic lipase mediates the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins via LDL receptor-related protein.The mechanisms whereby hepatic lipase facilitates the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins have not been elucidated. One study (10Aviram M. Bierman E.L. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15416-15422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that hydrolysis of the lipid core by the enzyme facilitates the uptake of lipoproteins. However, a number of recent reports (9Krapp A. Ahlem S. Kersting S. Hua Y. Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that nonenzymatic functions of hepatic lipase facilitate the uptake of plasma lipoproteins through an interaction between cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the apoB of lipoprotein particles. An association of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) with apoB-containing lipoproteins by a specific protein-protein interaction between LPL and apoB was recently reported by Choi et al. (11Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of amino acid sequences of hepatic lipase and LPL has shown that there is an extensive amino acid homology between these lipases (12Hide W.A. Chan L. Li W-H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, both LPL and hepatic lipase bind to proteoglycans (13Hayden M.R. Ma Y. Brunzell J. Henderson H.E. Curr. Opin. Lipodol. 1991; 2: 104-109Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that a nonenzymatic function of hepatic lipase may facilitate the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins.DISCUSSIONThe present experiments provide strong support for the hypothesis that an interaction between hepatic lipase and apoB facilitates the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins. There had been considerable evidence suggesting that hepatic lipase plays a role in the removal of apoB-containing lipoproteins (5de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Breckenridge W.C. Atherosclerosis. 1982; 45: 161-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Murase T.

This could be due to the lipolytic activity of the enzyme causing remodeling of the particles allowing enhanced uptake, as has been suggested by Aviram et al. (10Aviram M. Bierman E.L. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15416-15422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); alternatively, however, the recent evidence that lipoprotein lipase facilitates LDL uptake by binding LDL led us to explore this as a possible mechanism of hepatic lipase action.Evidence for a direct interaction of apoB with hepatic lipase was provided by ligand blots, solid phase and solution assays, and cell culture experiments. On a ligand blot, hepatic lipase bound to several forms of apoBs including B48 and B100 and the kallikrein cleavage products of apoB100, B26, and B74 (29Cardin A.D. Witt K.R. Chao J. Margolius H.S. Donaldson V.H. Jackson R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8522-8528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) present on lipoproteins but not to other apolipoproteins including apoE and apoAI. The interaction between apoB and hepatic lipase was further studied by solid phase and solution assays. In a solution assay, where hepatic lipase was in excess, LDL binding to hepatic lipase clearly shows saturation kinetics with a Kd of 52.86 nm. In a solid phase assay with apoB in excess, the requirement for the hepatic lipase secondary and/or tertiary structure was demonstrated. The functional significance of the interaction was demonstrated in cell culture where monoclonal antibodies against apoB on both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions inhibited the hepatic lipase-mediated LDL uptake. Lastly, LDL binding to hepatic lipase-saturated agarose gel was not inhibited by the presence of excess LPL, suggesting that these proteins bind to distinct regions of apoB.ApoB100 is a large glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 550 kDa and is virtually the only protein component of LDL particles. The carboxyl-terminal region of apoB is involved in binding to LDL receptors, and this region also contains five of seven apoB heparin binding sites (30Weisgraber K.H. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11097-11103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under physiologic ionic conditions, however, LDL binds weakly to heparin (31Iverius P.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2607-2613Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal region of apoB is hydrophilic and thought to be a globular structure that extends away from the lipid core of lipoproteins (32Chan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25621-25624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Possible functions of the amino-terminal region of apoB have recently been elucidated (33Ingram M.F. Shelness G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10279-10286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 34Kreuzer J. Whiter A.L. Knott T.J. Jien M-L. Mehrabian M. Scott J. Young S.G. Haberland M.E. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8682-8691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Using monoclonal antibodies against amino and carboxyl regions of apoB we recently demonstrated that the amino-terminal, but not the carboxyl-terminal, region of apoB interacts with LPL (36Sivaram P. Choi S.Y. Curtiss L.K. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9409-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to LPL, the present experiments suggest that both the amino and carboxyl regions of apoB have binding domains for hepatic lipase. Evidence supporting this was provided primarily by solid phase assays in which the binding of LDL to hepatic lipase-expressing CHO cells or purified hepatic lipase, respectively, was inhibited by both carboxyl- and amino-terminal anti-apoB antibodies (i.e. mAb47 and mAb3, respectively). Ligand blots using thrombin-digested apoB also showed that hepatic lipase bound to both amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of apoB (data not shown).The cell culture studies provide strong support for the concept that the interaction between apoB and hepatic lipase is of physiologic significance. In cell culture both antibodies also decreased LDL binding to cells that secreted hepatic lipase. Interpretation of the result with mAb3 is straight forward; its ability to eliminate the increment of binding due to the secretion of hepatic lipase supports the hypothesis that the hepatic lipase effect is due to an interaction with apoB. mAb47, however, binds to an epitope near the LDL receptor binding domain of apoB. Accordingly, its effect could be due to direct interference with the receptor-ligand interaction. Consistent with this was its ability to decrease cell association and degradation in control cells as well as in hepatic lipase-transfected cells. Interestingly, in the binding studies the antibody did not completely inhibit binding in either cell line but reduced binding in HL secretors to that of nonsecretors. Thus, if its main effect on LDL processing is on internalization, the effect on binding to the secretor could be due to elimination of the apoB-HL interaction. This requires further exploration. Taking the cell culture and solid phase assay data together, however, it appears that there are hepatic lipase binding sites on both the amino-terminal region of apoB and in the region near the LDL receptor binding domain.Earlier studies have clearly demonstrated the role of hepatic lipase in remodeling larger lipoproteins such as intermediate density lipoprotein and HDL2 into the smaller particles, LDL and HDL3, respectively. The lipolytic activity, however, may not be required for the facilitation of lipoprotein uptake by tissues. First, a previous in vivo study showed that, in mice, injection of anti-rat hepatic lipase antibody resulted in a small but significant reduction in the rate of chylomicron remnant removal from plasma (5de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the antibodies did not inhibit lipolysis by mouse hepatic lipase, suggesting that lipolysis was not the mechanism by which hepatic lipase enhanced remnant uptake. Second, in the present study the binding experiments were performed at 4 °C (Fig.4 B) to minimize lipid hydrolysis by hepatic lipase, and again, LDL binding was significantly enhanced in hepatic lipase-expressing cell lines, suggesting that a nonenzymatic function of hepatic lipase played a role in lipoprotein uptake. Further, the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (100 μm), an inhibitor of lipolytic activity, did not reduce the binding of hepatic lipase to LDL in solid phase assays. This is consistent with an expanding body of evidence that LPL, a closely related enzyme, does not require its catalytic activity for its interaction with LDL. Future experiments with active-site mutant proteins should help to elucidate this definitively.Possible nonenzymatic mechanisms of action of hepatic lipase include bridging of lipoproteins and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Previously, it was demonstrated that hepatic lipase enhanced the uptake of LDL in CHO cells transfected with rat hepatic lipase cDNA and that anti-LDL receptor antibodies virtually eliminated the hepatic lipase-mediated LDL uptake (8Choi S.Y. Komaromy M.C. Chen J. Fong L.G. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 848-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of LDL receptor and of LDL receptor-related protein in the transfected cells was identical to that in wild-type cells on both Western and Northern blots. Furthermore, kinetic studies indicated that the increased LDL binding in the hepatic lipase-secreting CHO cells was the result of a higher affinity of the particle for the LDL receptor. Together, these data suggest that hepatic lipase enhanced the uptake of LDL via the LDL receptor-mediated pathway by increasing its affinity for the receptor.A number of previous studies have suggested that lipoprotein lipase can anchor lipoproteins to cell surface and matrix proteoglycans (37Saxena U. Klein M.G. Vanni T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 38Eisenberg S. Sehayek E. Olivecrona T. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2013-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and this molecular bridge has been postulated to increase lipoprotein retention by subendothelial cell matrix and increase cellular lipoprotein uptake. Similarly it has been suggested (39Ji Z.S. Lauer S.J. Fazio S. Bensadoun A. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13429-13436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that hepatic lipase binding to lipoproteins requires heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and it was recently reported (9Krapp A. Ahlem S. Kersting S. Hua Y. Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that hepatic lipase mediates the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins via the LDL receptor-related protein and that this effect was absent in proteoglycan deficient cells.Based on the present study we propose that hepatic lipase enhances the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins by binding both to the cell surface, presumably to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and to apoB. Thus, hepatic lipase functions as a bridge. This could both facilitate hydrolysis of lipoproteins and increase their uptake via the LDL receptor by providing high affinity multifooted binding. Kinetic analysis suggests this is a plausible explanation.In our previous experiments (8Choi S.Y. Komaromy M.C. Chen J. Fong L.G. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 848-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the affinity Kd of LDL for the cell surface in wild-type CHO cells was 6.6 nmand about 10-fold higher, 0.6 nm (6 × 10−10m), to cells secreting hepatic lipase. The present studies provide support for the hypothesis that the increase in affinity is due to the polyvalent or multifooted binding created by the ability of apoB to bind to both the LDL receptor and hepatic lipase on the cell surface. Comparisons of polyvalent with monovalent binding have been carried out in studies of immunoglobulin (40Bach J-F. Bach J.-H. Antigen-Antibody Reactions In Immunology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc, New York1978: 248-286Google Scholar). It was found that IgG anti-dinitrophenyl antibodies bound to aggregated dinitrophenyl with 103 to 105greater affinity than to monomeric dinitrophenyl. This is because when multiple sites are present, the actual affinity may be much higher than the intrinsic affinity, due to the cooperation between sites. Thus even though the affinity of apoB for hepatic lipase, 52 nm, was about one-thirtieth that of LDL for the LDL receptor, which was determined to be 1.6 nm in a plate assay (41van Driel I.R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9533-9538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is highly plausible to suggest that the affinity of apoB for the multiple binding sites generated by both HL and LDL receptor was 10-fold enhanced compared with that for its binding to the LDL receptors alone. In fact the increase of 1 order of magnitude may be less than might have been expected from the immunoglobulin studies. This could be due to failure of each particle to undergo multifooted binding. It is, however, of comparable magnitude to the increase in the affinity for the LDL receptor of liposomes containing four molecules of apoE compared with those containing one molecule of apoE. We recently reported that theKd of LDL for LPL was 3.76 nm in solution assays using LPL-saturated heparin-agarose beads (42Choi S.Y. Pang L. Kern P.A. Kayden H.J. Curtiss L.K. Vanni-Reyes T.M. Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 77-85Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hepatic lipase, which has a Kd of 52 nm for LDL, does not have as high an affinity as LPL. Nonetheless, these considerations illustrate how the presence of a low affinity site in the proximity of a higher affinity site, by allowing multifooted binding, may account for a considerable enhancement of LDL uptake in the organ that expresses hepatic lipase bound to its surfaces.The previous report (11Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) suggested that the amino-terminal region of apoB is involved in its protein-protein interaction with LPL. In contrast, hepatic lipase binds to both the amino- and carboxyl-terminal region of apoB on ligand blot. Thus, hepatic lipase binding to apoB is not identical to LPL binding to apoB, although both enzymes appear to interact with apoB by a specific protein-protein interaction. This was further supported by the somewhat surprising lack of competition between hepatic lipase and lipoprotein lipase for apoB binding. This suggests that apoB, which has numerous potential sites for protein-protein interaction in regions where it is not interacting with the lipid surface can undergo interaction with a number of molecules, and these interactions may help to define its fate. Hepatic lipase is synthesized in hepatic parenchymal cells and functions primarily as an endothelial bound enzyme within the liver sinusoids (1Jensen G.L. Baly D.L. Brannon P.M. Bensadoun A. J. Biol.

Biochem J. 1981; 196: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The enzyme hydrolyzes triglycerides and phospholipids of the circulating lipoproteins; thus, it is involved in the metabolism of high density lipoproteins (HDL) 1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseapoapolipoproteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyHLhepatic lipase.1The abbreviations used are: HDLhigh density lipoproteinLDLlow density lipoproteinLPLlipoprotein lipaseapoapolipoproteinCHOChinese hamster ovaryPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisBSAbovine serum albuminTBSTris-buffered salinemAbmonoclonal antibodyHLhepatic lipase. converting the HDL2 fraction to HDL3 and in the conversion of intermediate density lipoprotein to low density lipoprotein (LDL). high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein lipoprotein lipase apolipoprotein Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline monoclonal antibody hepatic lipase. high density lipoprotein low density lipoprotein lipoprotein lipase apolipoprotein Chinese hamster ovary polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bovine serum albumin Tris-buffered saline monoclonal antibody hepatic lipase. Several lines of evidence now suggest that hepatic lipase may play another role in the metabolism of apoB-containing lipoproteins. In vivo inhibition of hepatic lipase, with an antibody to the protein, delays the clearance of chylomicron remnants (5de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and patients with hepatic lipase deficiency often have an accumulation of remnant-like lipoproteins in the plasma. Overexpression of hepatic lipase in transgenic rabbits results in reduced levels of plasma HDL and intermediate density lipoprotein (6Fan J. Wang J. Bensadoun A. Lauer S.J. Dang Q. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8724-8728Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Gel filtration studies of hepatic lipase in post-heparin plasma revealed that hepatic lipase is associated with lipoproteins that overlap the elution of small LDL (7Goldberg I.J. Kandel J.J. Blum C.B. Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1523-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it was demonstrated by this laboratory (8Choi S.Y. Komaromy M.C. Chen J. Fong L.G. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 848-859Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that hepatic lipase significantly enhanced LDL uptake via the LDL receptor pathway in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with rat hepatic lipase cDNA. The amount of the LDL receptor was virtually identical in the transfected cells as compared with the control cells; thus, the presence of hepatic lipase enhanced the affinity of the lipoprotein particle for the LDL receptor. Recently, Krapp et al. (9Krapp A. Ahlem S. Kersting S. Hua Y. Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that hepatic lipase mediates the uptake of apoE-containing lipoproteins via LDL receptor-related protein. The mechanisms whereby hepatic lipase facilitates the metabolism of plasma lipoproteins have not been elucidated. One study (10Aviram M. Bierman E.L. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15416-15422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that hydrolysis of the lipid core by the enzyme facilitates the uptake of lipoproteins. However, a number of recent reports (9Krapp A. Ahlem S. Kersting S. Hua Y. Kneser K. Nielsen M. Gliemann J. Beisiegel U. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 926-936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that nonenzymatic functions of hepatic lipase facilitate the uptake of plasma lipoproteins through an interaction between cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the apoB of lipoprotein particles. An association of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) with apoB-containing lipoproteins by a specific protein-protein interaction between LPL and apoB was recently reported by Choi et al. (11Choi S.Y. Sivaram P. Walker D.E. Curtiss L.K. Gretch D.G. Sturley S.L. Attie A.D. Deckelbaum R.J. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8081-8086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis of amino acid sequences of hepatic lipase and LPL has shown that there is an extensive amino acid homology between these lipases (12Hide W.A. Chan L. Li W-H. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, both LPL and hepatic lipase bind to proteoglycans (13Hayden M.R. Ma Y. Brunzell J. Henderson H.E. Curr. Opin. Lipodol. 1991; 2: 104-109Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the present studies were designed to test the hypothesis that a nonenzymatic function of hepatic lipase may facilitate the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins. DISCUSSIONThe present experiments provide strong support for the hypothesis that an interaction between hepatic lipase and apoB facilitates the uptake of apoB-containing lipoproteins. There had been considerable evidence suggesting that hepatic lipase plays a role in the removal of apoB-containing lipoproteins (5de Faria E. Fong L.G. Komaromy M. Cooper A.D. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 197-209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Breckenridge W.C. Atherosclerosis. 1982; 45: 161-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 26Murase T.

This could be due to the lipolytic activity of the enzyme causing remodeling of the particles allowing enhanced uptake, as has been suggested by Aviram et al. (10Aviram M. Bierman E.L. Chait A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15416-15422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); alternatively, however, the recent evidence that lipoprotein lipase facilitates LDL uptake by binding LDL led us to explore this as a possible mechanism of hepatic lipase action.Evidence for a direct interaction of apoB with hepatic lipase was provided by ligand blots, solid phase and solution assays, and cel"
https://openalex.org/W2095208985,"When simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen binds to the virus origin of replication, it forms a double hexamer that functions as a helicase to unwind the DNA bidirectionally. We demonstrate in this report that T antigen can unwind and release an origin DNA single strand of less than full length in the presence of purified human topoisomerase I. The sites nicked by topoisomerase I in the strands released by T antigen during DNA unwinding were localized primarily to the ""late"" side of the origin, and the template for lagging strand synthesis was preferred significantly over the one for leading strand synthesis. Importantly, these sites were, for the most part, different from the sites nicked by topoisomerase I in the absence of T antigen. These data indicate that T antigen activates topoisomerase I nicking at discrete sites and releases these nicked strands during unwinding. We hypothesize that a single molecule of topoisomerase I can form a functional complex with a double hexamer of T antigen to simultaneously relax and unwind double-stranded origin-containing DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2090483643,"Nodulation genes (nod) of rhizobia are essential for establishment of its symbiosis with specific legume hosts and are usually located on the Sym(biosis) megaplasmid. In this work we identified a new Sym plasmid independent protein inRhizobium leguminosarum, Px, by its ability to bind tonod promoters and induce DNA bending. Depending upon its concentrations relative to DNA templates, Px could either stimulate or inhibit in vitro transcription of the major regulatory nodulation gene nodD. This may result from its property to bind to specific sites within nod promoters at lower concentration or in the presence of competitor calf thymus DNA but nonspecifically associate with DNA at higher levels or in the absence of competitors. Its binding sites within nodD andnodF promoters were determined by DNase I footprinting but showed no sequence consensus. N-terminal sequencing and Western blot revealed that Px belongs to the HU class of prokaryotic histone-like proteins. Its binding feature and functioning mechanism were discussed in the light of this discovery."
https://openalex.org/W1964773769,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heat shock transcription factor (HSF) binds heat shock element (HSE) DNA shortly after DNA replication, independently of its activation by heat shock. To determine if HSF binding occurs before newly replicated DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, we inserted an HSE into a DNA segment that normally forms a positioned nucleosome in vivo. Transcription from constructs designed to create steric competition between binding of HSF and histone H2A-H2B dimers was generally poor, suggesting that nucleosome assembly precedes and inhibits HSF binding. However, one such construct was as transcriptionally active as a nucleosome-free control. Structural analyses suggested that ∼40 base pairs of DNA, including the HSE, had unwrapped from the 3′ edge of the histone octamer, allowing HSF to bind; ∼100 base pairs remained in association with the histone octamer, with the same translational and rotational orientation as was seen for the poorly transcribed constructs. Modeling studies suggest that the active and inactive constructs differ from one another in the ease with which the HSE and flanking sequences can adopt the curvature needed to form a stable nucleosome. These differences may influence the probability of DNA unwrapping from already assembled nucleosomes and the subsequent binding of HSF."
