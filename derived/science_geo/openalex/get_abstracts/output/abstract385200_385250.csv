https://openalex.org/W1971947883,"B-RAF is the most frequently mutated protein kinase in human cancers. The finding that oncogenic mutations in BRAF are common in melanoma, followed by the demonstration that these tumours are dependent on the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, offered hope that inhibition of B-RAF kinase activity could benefit melanoma patients. Herein, we describe the structure-guided discovery of PLX4032 (RG7204), a potent inhibitor of oncogenic B-RAF kinase activity. Preclinical experiments demonstrated that PLX4032 selectively blocked the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in BRAF mutant cells and caused regression of BRAF mutant xenografts. Toxicology studies confirmed a wide safety margin consistent with the high degree of selectivity, enabling Phase 1 clinical trials using a crystalline formulation of PLX4032 (ref. 5). In a subset of melanoma patients, pathway inhibition was monitored in paired biopsy specimens collected before treatment initiation and following two weeks of treatment. This analysis revealed substantial inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, yet clinical evaluation did not show tumour regressions. At higher drug exposures afforded by a new amorphous drug formulation, greater than 80% inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in the tumours of patients correlated with clinical response. Indeed, the Phase 1 clinical data revealed a remarkably high 81% response rate in metastatic melanoma patients treated at an oral dose of 960 mg twice daily. These data demonstrate that BRAF-mutant melanomas are highly dependent on B-RAF kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1991551376,"Introduction Flow diversion is a new approach to the endovascular treatment of intracranial aneurysms which uses a high density mesh stent to induce sac thrombosis. These devices have been designed for the treatment of complex shaped and large size aneurysms. So far published safety and efficacy data on this approach is sparse. Material and Methods Over 8 months, standardized clinical and angiographic data were collected on 70 patients treated with a flow diverter device (SILK flow diverter (SFD)) in 18 centres worldwide. Treatment and early follow up details were audited centrally. SFDs were deployed alone in 57 (81%) or with endosaccular coils in 10 (14%) aneurysms, which included: 44 (63%) saccular, 26 (37%) fusiform shapes and 18 (26%) small, 37 (53%) large, 15 (21%) giant sizes. Treatment outcome data up to 30 days were reported for all patients, with clinical (50 patients) and imaging (49 patients) follow up (median 119 days) data available. Results Difficulties in SFD deployment were reported in 15 (21%) and parent artery thrombosis in 8 (11%) procedures. Procedural complications caused stroke in 1 and serious extracranial bleeding in 3 patients; 2 of whom developed fatal pneumonias. Delayed worsening of symptoms occurred in 5 patients (3 transient, 1 permanent neurological deficit, and 1 death) and fatal aneurysm bleeding in 1 patient. Overall permanent morbidity rates were 2 (4%) and mortality 4 (8%). Statistical analysis revealed no significant association between complications and variables related to treated aneurysm morphology or rupture status. Conclusion This series is the largest reporting outcome of the new treatment approach and provides data for future study design. Procedural difficulties in SFD deployment were frequent and anti-thrombosis prophylaxis appears to reduce the resulting clinical sequelae, but at the cost of morbidity due to extracranial bleeding. Delayed morbidity appears to be a consequence of the new approach and warrants care in selecting patients for treatment and future larger studies."
https://openalex.org/W1988535230,"Micro RNAs are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate fundamental cellular and developmental processes at the transcriptional and translational level. In breast cancer, miR-145 expression is downregulated compared with healthy control tissue. As several predicted targets of miR-145 potentially regulate cell motility, we aimed at investigating a potential role for miR-145 in breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness. Assisted by Affymetrix array technology, we demonstrate that overexpression of miR-145 in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells and in Ishikawa endometrial carcinoma cells leads to a downregulation of the cell-cell adhesion protein JAM-A and of the actin bundling protein fascin. Moreover, podocalyxin and Serpin E1 mRNA levels were downregulated, and gamma-actin, transgelin and MYL9 were upregulated upon miR-145 overexpression. These miR-145-dependent expression changes drastically decreased cancer cell motility, as revealed by time-lapse video microscopy, scratch wound closure assays and matrigel invasion assays. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton and a change in cell morphology by miR-145 overexpression, resulting in a more cortical actin distribution, and reduced actin stress fiber and filopodia formation. Nuclear rotation was observed in 10% of the pre-miR-145 transfected MDA-MB-231 cells, accompanied by a reduction of perinuclear actin. Luciferase activation assays confirmed direct miR-145-dependent regulation of the 3'UTR of JAM-A, whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown of JAM-A expression resulted in decreased motility and invasiveness of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Our data identify JAM-A and fascin as novel targets of miR-145, firmly establishing a role for miR-145 in modulating breast cancer cell motility. Our data provide a rationale for future miR-145-targeted approaches of antimetastatic cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2010371279,"Background: Network communities help the functional organization and evolution of complex networks. However, the development of a method, which is both fast and accurate, provides modular overlaps and partitions of a heterogeneous network, has proven to be rather difficult. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we introduce the novel concept of ModuLand, an integrative method family determining overlapping network modules as hills of an influence function-based, centrality-type community landscape, and including several widely used modularization methods as special cases. As various adaptations of the method family, we developed several algorithms, which provide an efficient analysis of weighted and directed networks, and (1) determine pervasively overlapping modules with high resolution; (2) uncover a detailed hierarchical network structure allowing an efficient, zoom-in analysis of large networks; (3) allow the determination of key network nodes and (4) help to predict network dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The concept opens a wide range of possibilities to develop new approaches and applications including network routing, classification, comparison and prediction."

Using a biomembrane force probe capable of measuring single bond interactions, we showed ICAM-1 binding to LFA-1 at different conformations, including the bent conformation with the lowest affinity. We quantify how force and conformations of LFA-1 regulate its kinetics with ICAM-1. At zero-force, on-rates were substantially changed by conditions that differentially favor a bent or extended LFA-1 with a closed or open headpiece; but off-rates were identical. With increasing force, LFA-1/ICAM-1 bond lifetimes (reciprocal off-rates) first increased (catch bonds) and then decreased (slip bonds). Three states with distinct off-rates were identified from lifetime distributions. Force shifted the associated fractions from the short- to intermediate- and long-lived states, producing catch bonds at low forces, but increased their off-rates exponentially, converting catch to slip bonds at high forces. An internal ligand antagonist that blocks pulling of the α7-helix suppressed the intermediate-/long-lived states and eliminated catch bonds, revealing an internal catch bond between the αA and βA domains. These results elucidate an allosteric mechanism for the mechanochemistry of LFA-1/ICAM-1 binding.

A bell rope model has been suggested to relate different ligand binding affinities to distinct conformations of the αA domain, such that pulling down the α7-helix at the bottom opens the αA domain by rearranging the metal ion-dependent adhesion site (MIDAS) 2The abbreviations used are: MIDASmetal ion-dependent adhesion siteFNfibronectinBFPbiomembrane force probeRBCred blood cell. on the top to change from the low to intermediate and high affinity states (5Shimaoka M.

The downward movement of the αA domain α7-helix may result from binding of an intrinsic ligand on the α7-helix to the βA domain MIDAS, thereby connecting the conformational changes of the αA domain to those of the βA and other downstream domains of the integrin. Recently published crystal structures of αxβ2 integrin ectodomains reveal unexpected flexible αA domain (16Xie C. Zhu J. Chen X. Mi L. Nishida N. Springer T.A. EMBO J. 2009; : 666-679PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear how this flexibility affects binding of external ligand on the MIDAS and the intrinsic ligand on the α7-helix of the αA domain.FIGURE 5Model for LFA-1 activation. A, inactive, bent LFA-1 with a closed headpiece. The hybrid domain is closed. The αA domain is in the inactive conformation with the α7-helix in the up position and the MIDAS in the closed conformation. B and C, priming by inside-out signaling or metal ions extends LFA-1 with legs that may or may not separate, a hybrid domain that may or may not swing out, and the ligation between the αA and βA domain may or may not be stable. The αA domain flexibility is depicted by the dotted light yellow ellipsoids moving about the solid yellow αA domain in B, which disappears in C when the ligation between the αA and βA domains is enhanced by the hybrid domain swing-out. The on-rate for ICAM-1 is increased by different amounts depending on this ligation. Without force, however, the αA domain remains in a conformation that yields the same off-rate for ICAM-1 dissociation. D, force applied by ICAM-1 is transmitted from the αA domain MIDAS to the α7-helix (indicated by a curved arrow inside the αA domain) to elicit catch bonds between the intrinsic ligand and the βA domain, which pulls the α7-helix down (indicated) to induce the intermediate- and long-lived states, resulting in LFA-1/ICAM-1 catch bonds. E, regardless of priming, binding of XVA143 blocks the αA/βA ligation, makes the αA domain flexible, and pushes the βA domain α7-helix further downward, inducing conformational changes that propagate further downstream, including hybrid domain swing-out and integrin extension. On-rate for ICAM-1 is reduced but zero-force off-rate is the same. F, blocking the internal ligation shifts a portion of the force originally transmitted via the αA/βA ligation to other contacts between the αA and β-propeller domains, which reduces the force borne by the α7-helix (indicated by a smaller arrow). A much larger external force applied by ICAM-1 is needed to generate a similar internal force to pull down the αA domain α7-helix to induce the intermediate- and long-lived states; but the mechanism of forcing acceleration of dissociation dominates at such high forces, converting the LFA-1/ICAM-1 catch-slip bonds to that of slip-only.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) metal ion-dependent adhesion site fibronectin biomembrane force probe red blood cell. Integrin/ligand bonds are often subjected to forces externally applied to the cell, e.g. during leukocyte adhesion to vascular surfaces, or internally generated by the cell, e.g. during migration. Mechanical forces have been suggested to regulate integrin binding affinity by inducing conformational changes. For example, applying a shear flow to cells has been shown to enhance integrin/ligand binding (12Woolf E. Grigorova I. Sagiv A. Grabovsky V. Feigelson S.W. Shulman Z. Hartmann T. Sixt M. Cyster J.G.

Atomic force microscopy single-bond experiments have demonstrated that α5β1, an αA domain-lacking integrin, forms catch bonds with fibronectin (FN) in which force prolongs bond lifetimes in the 10–30 pN range (19Kong F. García A.J. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. Zhu C. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1275-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). Steered molecular dynamics simulations have suggested how force might activate integrin αA domains (20Jin M. Andricioaei I. Springer T.A. Structure. 2004; 12: 2137-2147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and the headpiece of integrin αVβ3 (21Puklin-Faucher E. Vogel V. J. Biol.

Using force clamp (25Lou J. Yago T. Klopochi A.G. Metha P. Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Bovin N.V. Zhu C. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and thermal fluctuation (26Chen W. Evans E.A. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) experiments to measure single bond interactions by a biomembrane force probe (BFP), here we show that lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), an αA domain-containing integrin αLβ2, forms catch-slip bonds with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in three cation conditions and in the presence of a chemokine that triggers inside-out signaling, which favor different LFA-1 conformations. Such a force dependence can be explained by two competing mechanisms: 1) at low forces, the dominating mechanism is forcing switch of LFA-1 from short-lived to intermediate- and long-lived states, which generates catch bonds; 2) at high forces, the dominating mechanism is forcing acceleration of dissociation, which results in slip bonds. An internal ligand antagonist molecule XVA143 (27Welzenbach K. Hommel U. Weitz-Schmidt G. J. Biol.

These results extend our recent demonstration of α5β1/FN catch bond by elucidating an allosteric regulatory mechanism of LFA-1/ICAM-1 dissociation by force that generates catch bonds. Jurkat cells purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum plus l-glutamine (4 mm) and penicillin/streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml). Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) were isolated from blood using a described protocol (29Yago T. Wu J. Wey C.D. Klopocki A.G. Zhu C. McEver R.P. J.

RBCs were biotinylated as described previously (26Chen W. Evans E.A. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh human RBCs were isolated from a blood drop via finger prick using a protocol approved by the Georgia Institute of Technology Institutional Review Board. RBCs were resuspended in carbonate/bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.4), and incubated with biotin-PEG3500-SGA (JenKem USA, Allen, TX) for 30 min at room temperature (25Lou J. Yago T. Klopochi A.G. Metha P.

Borosilicate glass beads (Duke Scientific, Palo Alto, CA) were cleaned with a mixture of ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide and water at boiling temperature. Beads were covalently coupled with mercapto-propyl-trimethoxy silane (United Chemical Technologies, Bristol, PA), and then covalently linked with a mixture of streptavidin-maleimide and maleimide-PEG3500-SGA (JenKem USA) that had been previously covalently coupled with ICAM-1-Fc chimeras or anti-LFA-1 mAbs through its SGA group. Our BFP apparatus has been described (25Lou J. Yago T. Klopochi A.G. Metha P. Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Bovin N.V. Zhu C. McEver R.P. J.

Briefly, an ultra-sensitive force probe was assembled by attaching a streptavidinylated bead bearing biotinylated ICAM-1 or anti-LFA-1 mAb to the apex of a biotinylated RBC that was aspirated by a micropipette (Fig. 1, A and B, left). The aspiration pressure was set by a manometer with micrometer precision. A Jurkat cell aspirated by another micropipette was driven by a piezoelectric translator with sub-nanometer precision via a capacitive sensor feedback control (Fig. 1A, right). The bead and the cell were aligned and observed under an inverted microscope through two cameras. One had a standard video rate of 30 frames per second to provide real-time images (Fig. 1A and supplemental videos S1 and S2). The other had a high speed (1,600 frames per second) when the images were limited to a 24-line strip across the bead, which allowed a custom image analysis software to track bead position with a spatial precision of 5 nm (30Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Sarangapani K.K. Huang J. Zhu C. Cell. Mol. Bioeng. 2008; 1: 276-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The BFP spring constant was determined from the suction pressure and the radii of the pipette, the spherical portion of the RBC, and the contact area between the probe and the RBC (30Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Sarangapani K.K. Huang J. Zhu C. Cell. Mol. Bioeng. 2008; 1: 276-288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Evans E. Heinrich V. Leung A. Kinoshita K. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 2288-2298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The spring constant was set at 0.3 pN/nm except for the thermal fluctuation experiments, which was <0.1 pN/nm. Jurkat cells were washed once using Hanks balanced salt solution without Ca2+ and Mg2+ (HBSS-, 150 mOsm, pH 7.4) with 5 mm EDTA to remove any divalent cations bound to LFA-1 during cell culture and washed again using HBSS- to remove EDTA. Depending on the experiments, cells were incubated in one of the four binding buffers (HBSS- containing 0.5% human serum albumin and 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ (Ca2+/Mg2+), 1 mm Ca2+ and 1 mm Mg2+ plus 10 nm chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 12 (Ca2+/Mg2+/CXCL12), 2 mm Mg2+ plus 2 mm EGTA (Mg2+/EGTA), or 1 mm Mn2+ (Mn2+)) with or without 1 μm XVA143 or 100 μg/ml soluble ICAM-1 at room temperature for 10 min before adding to the sample chamber that contained the same solution. In the force-clamp assay (25Lou J. Yago T. Klopochi A.G. Metha P. Chen W. Zarnitsyna V.I. Bovin N.V. Zhu C. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the Jurkat cell was driven repeatedly to approach and contact the bead with a 20-pN compressive force for 0.1 s to allow bond formation, retracted at a 3-μm/s speed for adhesion detection, held at a desired force to wait for bond dissociation, and returned to the original position to wait for the next cycle (Fig. 1C and supplemental video S1). Adhesion was detected by a tensile force signal caused by cell retraction. Lifetime was measured from the instant when the force reached the desired level to the instant of bond dissociation. To avoid force drift over long time, a 10-s cutoff was set to rupture bonds with lifetimes >10 s to start the next cycle. Adhesion frequency (Pa) was determined by dividing the number of resulting adhesions by the total number of contacts repeatedly made at a given duration. Two contact times were used: 1) 0.1 s for specificity controls (Fig. 1D) as this time was used for measuring lifetimes and 2) 2 s for measuring two-dimensional binding affinities (Ka) as this time is sufficiently long for binding kinetics to achieve equilibrium. Ka is lumped with the contact area Ac (a few percents of 3 μm2) and calculated using a published model (32Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) in Equation 1,AcKa=(mrml)−1ln⁡(1−Pa)−1(Eq. 1) where mr and ml are the respective densities of LFA-1 and ICAM-1 measured by flow cytometry. The effective on-rate is calculated from Ackon = AcKa × koff where the off-rate is from the negative slope of the corresponding zero-force lifetime distribution (Fig. 2E). Zero-force lifetimes were measured using the thermal fluctuation assay (26Chen W. Evans E.A. McEver R.P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 2008; 94: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After touching the bead, the Jurkat cell was retracted to the null position to allow contact with the bead via thermal motions without compression or tension. Bond association and dissociation under zero-force was manifested as sudden changes in the thermal fluctuations of the bead (Fig. 1E and supplemental video S2). Thermal fluctuations were quantified by 70-point sliding standard deviation σ (Fig. 1F) of the position (Fig. 1E) over time, which had a mean of 8 or 5 nm in the presence or absence of a bond. Lifetime was measured from the instant when σ dropped below 7.0 nm to the instant when σ rose above 7.5 nm. Lifetimes were measured from the instant of bond formation to that of bond dissociation. At each force bin, the survival frequency as a function of time was calculated as the fraction of events with a lifetime >t, which included both short (<10 s) and long (>10 s) lifetime events. To characterize the conformations of Jurkat cell LFA-1 in different conditions, cells were washed once using HBSS- with 5 mm EDTA, washed again using HBSS- without EDTA, incubated in one of the four binding buffers with or without 1 μm XVA143 at 37 °C for 10 min, and incubated in the same buffer plus 10 μg/ml PE-conjugated HI 111, PE-conjugated MEM-148, KIM127, or TS1/22 mAb at 37 °C for 30 min. For the last two cases where unconjugated mAbs were used, cells were further incubated with 10 μg/ml PE-conjugated Fab fragment of a goat-anti-mouse antibody at room temperature for an additional 30 min. Cells were then washed and resuspended in the same buffer at 4 °C for immediate analysis by a BD LSR flow cytometer (BD Sciences). To determine the Mac-1 expression, Jurkat cells or PMNs washed as described in the preceding paragraph were incubated with 10 μg/ml PE-conjugated anti-αM mAb at 37 °C for 30 min in binding butter containing Ca2+/Mg2+ or Ca2+/Mg2+/CXCL12, washed and re-suspended in the same buffer at 4 °C for immediate flow cytometric analysis. To determine the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) expression, Jurkat cells washed as previously described in the preceding paragraph were incubated in binding butter containing Ca2+/Mg2+ or Ca2+/Mg2+/CXCL12 at room temperature for 1 or 2 h, then incubated with 10 μg/ml PE-conjugated anti-CXCR4 mAb at room temperature for 30 min, washed and re-suspended in the same buffer for immediate flow cytometric analysis. To measure the LFA-1 site density on Jurkat cells and ICAM-1 site densities on the beads, Jurkat cells stained with PE-conjugated anti-LFA-1 mAb and ICAM-1 beads stained with PE-conjugated anti-ICAM-1 mAb were, respectively, analyzed by flow cytometry. Standard beads (BD Sciences) were used to generate a calibration curve to relate the florescence intensity with the number of fluorescent molecules. The site densities were determined by dividing the number of fluorescent molecules by the respective apparent areas of a Jurkat cell and a bead (32Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The survival frequency and the rupture probability data for each force bin were simultaneously fitted by a model that assumes superposition of exponential decays in Equation 2,{ln⁡( Survival Frequency )=ln⁡[∑i=1nωiexp⁡(−kit)] Rupture Probability =1−∑i=1nωiexp⁡(−kit)(Eq. 2) where t is time, ki and ωi are, respectively, the off-rate and fraction of the ith state. The sum of fractions equals to 1. Both two- (n = 2) and three-state (n = 3) models were tested. The Bell equation (33Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar) below was fit to the force-dependent off-rate of each state that was returned from the curve-fitting of lifetime distributions with the three-state model in Equation 3,ki=ki0exp⁡(aif/kBT)i=1−3(Eq. 3) where f is force and ki0 and ai are, respectively, zero-force off-rate and reactive compliance of the ith state, kB is Boltzmann constant, and T is absolute temperature. The average lifetimes that include both the short (<10 s) and long (>10 s) fractions (Fig. 4J) were calculated from the three-state model parameters as <t> = ω1/k1 + ω2/k2 + ω3/k3. Experimental results at different conditions were analyzed by the Welch's t test (34Welch B.L. Biometrika. 1947; 34: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar). The zero-force off-rates at various conditions were compared with the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison methods (35Wu C.F. Hamada M.S. Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Optimization. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2009: 53-57Google Scholar). The goodness-of-fit of the three-state and two-state models were assessed by the reduced chi squares (χν2) and compared with the F-test (36Lomax R.G. Hahs-Vaughn D.L. Statistical Concepts: A Second Course. Routledge Academic, New York2007: 10Google Scholar). p < 0.01 is defined as significant difference. The details of the Welch's t test, Tukey-Kramer method, and F-test follow. Welch's t test (34Welch B.L. Biometrika. 1947; 34: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (3134) Google Scholar) can be viewed as a modified Student's t test to compare two samples with unequal variances. If mi, si, and ni are the respective mean, variance, and sample size of the ith sample, then the t statistic can be calculated in Equation 4,t=(m1−m2)/(s1/n1+s2/n2)1/2(Eq. 4) and the degrees of freedom ν can be approximated in Equation 5,v=(s1/n1+s2/n2)2/(s12/(n12(n1−1))+s22/(n22(n2−1)))(Eq. 5) t and ν can be used with the t-distribution to test the null hypothesis that two populations have equal means, which will generate a p value for the level of significance of the difference between the two means. The Welch's t test was used to compare adhesion frequencies measured at different conditions. It was also used to compare the maximum value and the zero-force value in the catch-slip bond average lifetime versus force curves. The Tukey-Kramer method (35Wu C.F. Hamada M.S. Experiments: Planning, Analysis, and Optimization. 2nd Ed. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2009: 53-57Google Scholar) is a one-way layout multiple comparison statistical test generally used with an ANOVA to determine if the means are significantly different with each other among several data sets. Based on a Studentized range distribution, the Tukey-Kramer method calculates a minimum significant difference between each data pair. The difference of the two data sets is not significant if this minimum significant difference is larger than the actual difference of the “means” of the two pairs. The Tukey-Kramer multiple-comparison method was used to compare the differences of zero-force off-rates at various conditions. The zero-force off-rates were obtained from the negative slopes of the linear fits to the ln(survival frequency) versus lifetime data measured by the thermal fluctuation assay (see Fig. 2E). The slope was treated as the “mean” for a data set. The differences between the means and the experimental values of the survival frequency at each lifetime are treated as the “variances” of the data set. F-test (36Lomax R.G. Hahs-Vaughn D.L. Statistical Concepts: A Second Course. Routledge Academic, New York2007: 10Google Scholar) is generally used to determine which model can better fit the data when the population has an F-distribution under null hypothesis. We used a two-state model with three parameters (p2 = 3) and a three-state model with five parameters (p3 = 5) to fit the lifetime distributions. At first glance, the three-state model should be able to fit the data better than the two-state model because the latter model can be viewed as a special case of the former mode. However, this was not always the case in our problem because we constrained the three-state model fitting by requiring the off-rate of each state to obey the Bell equation but did not constrain the two-state model fitting.

https://openalex.org/W2048399342,"Inadequate extracellular conditions can adversely affect the environment of the ER and impinge on the maturation of nascent proteins. The resultant accumulation of unfolded proteins activates a signal transduction pathway, known as the unfolded protein response, which serves primarily to protect the cell during stress and helps restore homeostasis to the ER.Microarray analysis of the unfolded protein response in a human medulloblastoma cell line treated with thapsigargin revealed that, in addition to known targets, a large number of proangiogenic factors were up-regulated. Real-Time PCR analyses confirmed that four of these factors, VEGFA, FGF2, angiogenin and IL8, were transcriptionally up-regulated in multiple cell lines by various ER stress inducers. Our studies on VEGFA regulation revealed that XBP-1(S), a UPR-inducible transcription factor, bound to two regions on the VEGFA promoter, and analysis of XBP-1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts revealed that it contributes to VEGFA expression in response to ER stress. ATF4, another UPR-inducible transcription factor, also binds to the VEGFA gene, although its contribution to VEGFA transcription appeared to be fairly modest. We also found that VEGFA mRNA stability is increased in response to UPR activation, via activation of AMP kinase, demonstrating that increased mRNA levels occur at two regulatory points. In keeping with the mRNA levels, we found that VEGFA protein is secreted at levels as high as or higher than that achieved in response to hypoxia.Our results indicate that the UPR plays a significant role in inducing positive regulators of angiogenesis. It also regulates VEGFA expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels and is likely to have widespread implications for promoting angiogenesis in response to normal physiological cues as well as in pathological conditions like cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2148066526,"CD133 (prominin-1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of normal and cancer stem cells (tumor-initiating cells), progenitor cells, rod photoreceptor cells and a variety of epithelial cells. Although CD133 is widely used as a marker of various somatic and putative cancer stem cells, its contribution to the fundamental properties of cancer cells, such as tumorigenesis and differentiation, remains to be elucidated. In the present report, we found that CD133 was expressed in several neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines/tumor samples. Intriguingly, CD133 repressed NB cell differentiation, for example neurite extension and the expression of differentiation marker proteins, and was decreased by several differentiation stimuli, but accelerated cell proliferation, anchorage-independent colony formation and in vivo tumor formation of NB cells. NB cell line and primary tumor-sphere experiments indicated that the molecular mechanism of CD133-related differentiation suppression in NB was in part dependent on neurotrophic receptor RET tyrosine kinase regulation. RET transcription was suppressed by CD133 in NB cells and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor treatment failed to induce RET in CD133-expressing cells; RET overexpression rescued CD133-related inhibition of neurite elongation. Of note, CD133-related NB cell differentiation and RET repression were mainly dependent on p38MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Furthermore, CD133 has a function in growth and RET expression in NB cell line- and primary tumor cell-derived tumor spheres. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the function of CD133 in cancer cells and our findings may be applied to improve differentiation induction therapy for NB patients."
https://openalex.org/W2067942082,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and comprises two major histological subtypes: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS). Seventy-five percent of ARMS harbor reciprocal chromosomal translocations leading to fusion genes of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1 and PAX3 or PAX7. The hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been implied in tumor formation and progression of various cancers including RMS. However, whether Hh pathway activation presents a general feature of RMS or whether it is restricted to specific subgroups has not yet been addressed. Here, we report that marker genes of active Hh signaling, that is, Patched1 (Ptch1), Gli1, Gli3 and Myf5, are expressed at significantly higher levels in ERMS and fusion gene-negative ARMS compared with fusion gene-positive ARMS in two distinct cohorts of RMS patients. Consistently, Gli1 expression correlates with Ptch1 expression in ERMS and fusion gene-negative ARMS, but not in fusion gene-positive ARMS. In addition, expression levels of MyoD1 are significantly lower in ERMS and fusion gene-negative ARMS, pointing to an inverse association of Hh activation and early muscle differentiation. Moreover, Myf5 is identified as a novel excellent class predictor for RMS by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Importantly, high expression of Ptch1 or low MyoD1 expression significantly correlate with reduced cumulative survival in fusion gene-negative RMS underscoring the clinical relevance of these findings. By showing that Hh signaling is preferentially activated in specific subgroups of RMS, our study has important implications for molecular targeted therapies, such as small molecule Hh inhibitors, in RMS."
https://openalex.org/W2129245282,"Activating mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS occur in ∼60 and ∼15% of melanomas, respectively. The most common mutation in B-RAF is V600E, which activates B-RAF and the downstream MEK–ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, B-RAFV600E is a viable therapeutic target. PLX4720 is a selective inhibitor of mutant B-RAF and its analog, PLX4032, is currently undergoing clinical trials in melanoma. However, the effects of PLX4720 across the genotypic spectrum in melanoma remain unclear. Here, we describe that PLX4720 treatment rapidly induces hyperactivation of the MEK–ERK1/2 pathway in mutant N-RAS melanoma cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C-RAF is the major RAF isoform involved in this process. Importantly, PLX4720-induced hyperactivation of the MEK–ERK1/2 pathway promotes resistance to apoptosis in both non-invasive and invasive mutant N-RAS melanoma cells but does not enhance cell cycle properties. These findings underscore the need to genotypically stratify melanoma patients before enrollment on a mutant B-RAF inhibitor trial."

https://openalex.org/W2029596323,"Although deregulation of the Wnt signalling pathway has been implicated in urothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), the functional significance is unknown. To test its importance, we have targeted expression of an activated form of β-catenin to the urothelium of transgenic mice using Cre-Lox technology (UroIICRE(+) β-catenin(exon3/+)). Expression of this activated form of β-catenin led to the formation of localized hyperproliferative lesions by 3 months, which did not progress to malignancy. These lesions were characterized by a marked increase of the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) tumour suppressor protein. This appears to be a direct consequence of activating Wnt signalling in the bladder as conditional deletion of the adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene within the adult bladder led rapidly to coincident β-catenin and PTEN expression. This PTEN expression blocked proliferation. Next, we combined PTEN deficiency with β-catenin activation and found that this caused papillary UCC. These tumours had increased pAKT signalling and were dependent on mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Importantly, in human UCC, there was a significant correlation between high levels of β-catenin and pAKT (and low levels of PTEN). Taken together these data show that deregulated Wnt signalling has a critical role in promoting UCC, and suggests that human UCC that have high levels of Wnt and PI3 kinase signalling may be responsive to mTOR inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2045918793,"Circadian rhythms govern many aspects of physiology and behavior including cognitive processes. Components of neural circuits involved in learning and memory, e.g., the amygdala and the hippocampus, exhibit circadian rhythms in gene expression and signaling pathways. The functional significance of these rhythms is still not understood. In the present study, we sought to determine the impact of transiently disrupting the circadian system by shifting the light/dark (LD) cycle. Such ""jet lag"" treatments alter daily rhythms of gene expression that underlie circadian oscillations as well as disrupt the synchrony between the multiple oscillators found within the body.We subjected adult male C57Bl/6 mice to a contextual fear conditioning protocol either before or after acute phase shifts of the LD cycle. As part of this study, we examined the impact of phase advances and phase delays, and the effects of different magnitudes of phase shifts. Under all conditions tested, we found that recall of fear conditioned behavior was specifically affected by the jet lag. We found that phase shifts potentiated the stress-evoked corticosterone response without altering baseline levels of this hormone. The jet lag treatment did not result in overall sleep deprivation, but altered the temporal distribution of sleep. Finally, we found that prior experience of jet lag helps to compensate for the reduced recall due to acute phase shifts.Acute changes to the LD cycle affect the recall of fear-conditioned behavior. This suggests that a synchronized circadian system may be broadly important for normal cognition and that the consolidation of memories may be particularly sensitive to disruptions of circadian timing."
https://openalex.org/W2032204719,"Elevated expression of the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CTSB) has been correlated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients. In order to model high CTSB expression in mammary cancer, transgenic mice expressing human CTSB were crossed with transgenic polyoma virus middle T oncogene breast cancer mice (mouse mammary tumor virus-PymT), resulting in a 20-fold increase in cathepsin B activity in the tumors of double-transgenic animals. CTSB expression did not affect tumor onset, but CTSB transgenic mice showed accelerated tumor growth with significant increase in weight for end-stage tumors, as well as an overall worsening in their histopathological grades. Notably, the lung metastases in the CTSB transgenic animals were found to be both significantly larger and to occur at a significantly higher frequency. Ex vivo analysis of primary PymT tumor cells revealed no significant effects from elevated CTSB levels on tumor cell characteristics, that is, the formation of tumor cell colonies and the sprouting of invasive strands from PymT cell spheroids. However, tumors from CTSB-overexpressing mice showed increased numbers of tumor-associated B cells and mast cells. In addition, more CD31+ endothelial cells were detected in these tumors, correlating with higher levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) being present in the tumor and serum. We conclude that elevated proteolytic CTSB activity facilitates progression and metastasis of PymT-induced mammary carcinomas, and is associated with increased immune cell infiltration, enhanced VEGF levels and the promotion of tumor angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2007771379,"Background Angiogenesis is a key hallmark of tumourigenesis and its inhibition is a proven strategy for the development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. An important aspect of early angiogenesis is the co-ordinated migration and invasion of endothelial cells through the hypoxic tumour tissue. Cathepsin S has been shown to play an important role in angiogenesis as has vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We sought to assess the anti-angiogenic effect of Fsn0503, a novel cathepsin S inhibitory antibody, when combined with anti-VEGF on vascular development. Methodology/Principal Findings Cathepsin S expression and secretion from endothelial cells was characterised using RT-PCR and western blotting. We further show that cathepsin S promotes pericellular hydrolysis of extracellular matrix components in the tumour microenvironment and facilitates endothelial invasion. The cathepsin S inhibitory antibody, Fsn0503, blocks extracellular proteolysis, inhibiting endothelial invasion and tube formation in cell-based assays. The anti-angiogenic effects of Fsn0503 were also shown in vivo where it significantly retarded the development of vasculature in human xenograft models. Furthermore, when Fsn0503 was combined with an anti-VEGF antibody, a synergistic inhibition of microvascular development was observed. Conclusions/Significance Taken together, this data demonstrates that the antibody-mediated targeting of cathepsin S represents a novel method of inhibiting angiogenesis. Furthermore, when used in combination with anti-VEGF therapies, Fsn0503 has the potential to significantly enhance current treatments of tumour neovascularisation and may also be of use in the treatment of other conditions associated with inappropriate angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2038509886,"Cryptococcus neoformans is a human opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for ∼1/3 of HIV/AIDS deaths worldwide. This budding yeast expresses a polysaccharide capsule necessary for virulence. Capsule production inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages. Here we describe results that link copper homeostasis to capsule production and the inhibition of phagocytosis. Specifically, using Agrobacterium-mediated insertional mutagenesis, we identified an insertion in the promoter region of the putative copper transporter-encoding gene CTR2 that results in reduced expression of CTR2 and increased phagocytosis by murine RAW264.7 macrophages. The mutant also displayed sensitivity to copper starvation and defects in polysaccharide capsule production and melanization. These defects were all reversed by genetic correction of the promoter insertion by homologous targeting. Several melanization-defective mutants identified previously, those in the RIM20, RIM101, and VPS25 genes, also display sensitivity to copper starvation, reduced capsule production and increased phagocytosis. Together these results indicate a previously undescribed link between copper homeostasis to polysaccharide capsule production and phagocytosis inhibition in Cryptococcus neoformans."
https://openalex.org/W2055815963,"Natural killer (NK) cells are lymphocyte effectors that are activated to control certain microbial infections and tumors. Many NK-activating and regulating receptors are involved in regulating NK cell function. In addition, activation of naïve NK cells is fundamentally triggered by cytokines or myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) in various modes. In this study, we synthesized 16 S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyl)propyl]cysteine (Pam2Cys) lipopeptides with sequences designed from lipoproteins of Staphylococcus aureus, and assessed their functional properties using mouse (C57BL/6) bone marrow-derived DC (BMDC) and NK cells. NK cell activation was evaluated by three criteria: IFN-γ production, up-regulation of NK activation markers and cytokines, and NK target (B16D8 cell) cytotoxicity. The diacylated lipopeptides acted as TLR2 ligands, inducing up-regulation of CD25/CD69/CD86, IL-6, and IL-12p40, which represent maturation of BMDC. Strikingly, the Pam2Cys lipopeptides induced mouse NK cell activation based on these criteria. Cell-cell contact by Pam2Cys peptide-stimulated BMDC and NK cells rather than soluble mediators released by stimulated BMDC induced activation of NK cells. For most lipopeptides, the BMDC TLR2/MyD88 pathway was responsible for driving NK activation, while some slightly induced direct activation of NK cells via the TLR2/MyD88 pathway in NK cells. The potential for NK activation was critically regulated by the peptide primary sequence. Hydrophobic or proline-containing sequences proximal to the N-terminal lipid moiety interfered with the ability of lipopeptides to induce BMDC-mediated NK activation. This mode of NK activation is distinctly different from that induced by polyI:C, which is closely associated with type I IFN-inducing pathways of BMDC. These results imply that the MyD88 pathway of BMDC governs an alternative NK-activating pathway in which the peptide sequence of TLR2-agonistic lipopeptides critically affects the potential for NK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2113572376,"Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate and CO2 and uses NAD as a cofactor. Higher expression of this enzyme correlates with the degree of cell de-differentiation. We found that ME2 is expressed in K562 erythroleukemia cells, in which a number of agents have been found to induce differentiation either along the erythroid or the myeloid lineage. We found that knockdown of ME2 led to diminished proliferation of tumor cells and increased apoptosis in vitro. These findings were accompanied by differentiation of K562 cells along the erythroid lineage, as confirmed by staining for glycophorin A and hemoglobin production. ME2 knockdown also totally abolished growth of K562 cells in nude mice. Increased ROS levels, likely reflecting increased mitochondrial production, and a decreased NADPH/NADP+ ratio were noted but use of a free radical scavenger to decrease inhibition of ROS levels did not reverse the differentiation or apoptotic phenotype, suggesting that ROS production is not causally involved in the resultant phenotype. As might be expected, depletion of ME2 induced an increase in the NAD+/NADH ratio and ATP levels fell significantly. Inhibition of the malate-aspartate shuttle was insufficient to induce K562 differentiation. We also examined several intracellular signaling pathways and expression of transcription factors and intermediate filament proteins whose expression is known to be modulated during erythroid differentiation in K562 cells. We found that silencing of ME2 leads to phospho-ERK1/2 inhibition, phospho-AKT activation, increased GATA-1 expression and diminished vimentin expression. Metabolomic analysis, conducted to gain insight into intermediary metabolic pathways that ME2 knockdown might affect, showed that ME2 depletion resulted in high orotate levels, suggesting potential impairment of pyrimidine metabolism. Collectively our data point to ME2 as a potentially novel metabolic target for leukemia therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2024930645,"Zinc has a crucial role in the biology of p53 in that p53 binds to DNA through a structurally complex domain stabilized by zinc atom. The p53 negative regulator MDM2 protein also carries a C-terminal RING domain that coordinates two zinc atoms, which are responsible for p53 nuclear export and proteasomal degradation. In this clinically translatable study, we explored the critical role of zinc on p53 reactivation by MDM2 inhibitor, MI-219, in colon and breast cancer cells. ZnCl2 enhanced MI-219 activity (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), apoptosis and colony formation), and chelation of zinc not only blocked the activity of MI-219, but also suppressed reactivation of the p53 and its downstream effector molecules p21WAF1 and Bax. N,N,N′N′-tetrakis(−)[2-pyridylmethyl]-ethylenediamine (TPEN), a specific zinc chelator, but not 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (Bapta-AM), a calcium chelator, blocked MI-219-induced apoptosis. Nuclear localization is a prerequisite for proper functioning of p53 and our results confirm that TPEN, and not Bapta-AM, could abrogate p53 nuclear localization and it interfered with p53 transcriptional activation. Addition of zinc suppressed the known p53 feedback MDM2 activation, which could be restored by TPEN. Co-immunoprecipitation studies verified that MI-219-mediated MDM2-p53 disruption could be suppressed by TPEN and restored by zinc. As such, single-agent therapies that target MDM2 inhibition, without supplemental zinc, may not be optimal in certain patients owing to the less recognized mild zinc deficiency among the ‘at-risk population’ as in the elderly who are more prone to cancers. Therefore, use of supplemental zinc with MI-219 will benefit the overall efficacy of MIs and this potent combination warrants further investigation."

Here we report a line of BAC transgenic mice (GAD67-GFP mice) that selectively and transitorily express GFP in newborn dentate granule cells of the adult hippocampus. These GFP+ cells show a high degree of colocalization with BrdU-labeled nuclei one week after BrdU injection and express the newborn neuron marker doublecortin and PSA-NCAM. Compared to mature dentate granule cells, these newborn neurons show immature morphological features: dendritic beading, fewer dendritic branches and spines. These GFP+ newborn neurons also show immature electrophysiological properties: higher input resistance, more depolarized resting membrane potentials, small and non-typical action potentials. The bright labeling of newborn neurons with GFP makes it possible to visualize the details of dendrites, which reach the outer edge of the molecular layer, and their axon (mossy fiber) terminals, which project to the CA3 region where they form synaptic boutons. GFP expression covers the whole developmental stage of newborn neurons, beginning within the first week of cell division and disappearing as newborn neurons mature, about 4 weeks postmitotic. Thus, the GAD67-GFP transgenic mice provide a useful genetic tool for studying the development and regulation of newborn dentate granule cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017064535,"Topoisomerase II (Top2) is a nuclear enzyme involved in several metabolic processes of DNA. Chemotherapy agents that poison Top2 are known to induce persistent protein-mediated DNA double strand breaks (DSB). In this report, by using knock down experiments, we demonstrated that Top2alpha was largely responsible for the induction of gammaH2AX and cytotoxicity by the Top2 poisons idarubicin and etoposide in normal human cells. As DSB resulting from Top2 poisons-mediated damage may be repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR), we aimed to analyze both DNA repair pathways. We found that DNA-PKcs was rapidly activated in human cells, as evidenced by autophosphorylation at serine 2056, following Top2-mediated DNA damage. The chemical inhibition of DNA-PKcs by wortmannin and vanillin resulted in an increased accumulation of DNA DSB, as evaluated by the comet assay. This was supported by a hypersensitive phenotype to Top2 poisons of Ku80- and DNA-PKcs- defective Chinese hamster cell lines. We also showed that Rad51 protein levels, Rad51 foci formation and sister chromatid exchanges were increased in human cells following Top2-mediated DNA damage. In support, BRCA2- and Rad51C- defective Chinese hamster cells displayed hypersensitivity to Top2 poisons. The analysis by immunofluorescence of the DNA DSB repair response in synchronized human cell cultures revealed activation of DNA-PKcs throughout the cell cycle and Rad51 foci formation in S and late S/G2 cells. Additionally, we found an increase of DNA-PKcs-mediated residual repair events, but not Rad51 residual foci, into micronucleated and apoptotic cells. Therefore, we conclude that in human cells both NHEJ and HR are required, with cell cycle stage specificity, for the repair of Top2-mediated reversible DNA damage. Moreover, NHEJ-mediated residual repair events are more frequently associated to irreversibly damaged cells."
https://openalex.org/W2077240464,"Autism is a common heritable neurodevelopmental disorder with complex etiology. Several genome-wide linkage and association scans have been carried out to identify regions harboring genes related to autism or autism spectrum disorders, with mixed results. Given the overlap in autism features with genetic abnormalities known to be associated with imprinting, one possible reason for lack of consistency would be the influence of parent-of-origin effects that may mask the ability to detect linkage and association.We have performed a genome-wide linkage scan that accounts for potential parent-of-origin effects using 16,311 SNPs among families from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) and the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) autism repository. We report parametric (GH, Genehunter) and allele-sharing linkage (Aspex) results using a broad spectrum disorder case definition. Paternal-origin genome-wide statistically significant linkage was observed on chromosomes 4 (LOD(GH) = 3.79, empirical p<0.005 and LOD(Aspex) = 2.96, p = 0.008), 15 (LOD(GH) = 3.09, empirical p<0.005 and LOD(Aspex) = 3.62, empirical p = 0.003) and 20 (LOD(GH) = 3.36, empirical p<0.005 and LOD(Aspex) = 3.38, empirical p = 0.006).These regions may harbor imprinted sites associated with the development of autism and offer fruitful domains for molecular investigation into the role of epigenetic mechanisms in autism."

https://openalex.org/W2089932571,"C-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1) is a transcriptional co-repressor and metabolic sensory protein, which often represses tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we sought to determine if CtBP1 affects expression of the tumor suppressor Brca1 in head and neck tissue, as downregulation of Brca1 begins at the early stages of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). We found that CtBP1 represses Brca1 transcription by binding to the E2F4 site of the Brca1 promoter. Additionally, the recruitment of CtBP1 to the Brca1 promoter is redox-dependent, that is, increased at high NADH levels in hypoxic conditions. Further, immunostaining using a human HNSCC tissue array revealed that nuclear CtBP1 staining began to accumulate in hyperplasic lesions and HNSCCs, this staining correlated with Brca1 downregulation in these lesions. Pharmacological disruption of CtBP1 binding to Brca1 promoter by the antioxidant Tempol, which reduces NADH levels, relieved CtBP1-mediated repression of Brca1, leading to increased DNA repair in HNSCC cells. As tumor cells are generally hypoxic with increased NADH levels, the dynamic control of Brca1 by a 'metabolic switch' found in this study not only provides an important link between tumor metabolism and tumor suppressor expression but also suggests a potential chemo preventative or therapeutic strategy for HNSCC by blocking NADH-dependent CtBP1 activity at early stages of HNSCC carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2085427985,"Background Pluripotency and self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) is mediated by a complex interplay between extra- and intracellular signaling pathways, which regulate the expression of pluripotency-specific transcription factors. The homeodomain transcription factor NANOG plays a central role in maintaining hESC pluripotency, but the precise role and regulation of NANOG are not well defined. Methodology/Principal Findings To facilitate the study of NANOG expression and regulation in viable hESC cultures, we generated fluorescent NANOG reporter cell lines by gene targeting in hESCs. In these reporter lines, the fluorescent reporter gene was co-expressed with endogenous NANOG and responded to experimental induction or repression of the NANOG promoter with appropriate changes in expression levels. Furthermore, NANOG reporter lines facilitated the separation of hESC populations based on NANOG expression levels and their subsequent characterization. Gene expression arrays on isolated hESC subpopulations revealed genes with differential expression in NANOGhigh and NANOGlow hESCs, providing candidates for NANOG downstream targets hESCs. Conclusion/Significance The newly derived NANOG reporter hESC lines present novel tools to visualize NANOG expression in viable hESCs. In future applications, these reporter lines can be used to elucidate the function and regulation of NANOG in pluripotent hESCs."
https://openalex.org/W2086825161,"Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptor, IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R), have important roles in growth, development, stress response, aging and cancer. There are many agents that inhibit IGF1R in oncology clinical development, and in some cases, they have been associated with rapid tumor regression. However, it is not clear by which process these targeted agents induce cancer cell death and how to predict such tumor responses. Here, we showed that IGF1R antibody led to rapid cell death and tumor regression in some rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells. Mechanistic analysis revealed a rapid onset of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, including mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome C release and the activation of specific caspases. The antibody sensitive cells had greater dependence on AKT for maintaining downstream signaling and the expression of a constitutively active AKT, which restored AKT-signaling in these cells, inhibited anti-IGF1R induced cell death. Further analysis showed IGF1R antibody-induced hypophosphorylation of BAD and activation of downstream BAX. Interestingly, the examination of RMS cell lines and tumors revealed an inverse correlation between elevated IGF1R and Bcl-2 level (P=0.033), with the sensitive cells lacking Bcl-2 expression. The overexpression of BAD specific target, Bcl-x(L), conferred resistance, whereas Bcl-x(L) knockdown sensitized cells lacking Bcl-2 to anti-IGF1R-induced cell death. We propose that RMS pathogenesis involves increased IGF1R expression that enhances AKT and Bcl-x(L)-mediated cell survival, and the blockage of IGF1R results in inhibition of survival signal from Bcl-x(L) and cell death in the sensitive Bcl-2 negative cells."

https://openalex.org/W2090671871,"Activator protein one (AP1) (jun/fos) factors comprise a family of transcriptional regulators (c-jun, junB, junD, c-fos, FosB, Fra-1 and Fra-2) that are key controllers of epidermal keratinocyte survival and differentiation, and are important drivers of cancer development. Understanding the role of these factors in epidermis is complicated by the fact that each member is expressed in defined cell layers during epidermal differentiation, and because AP1 factors regulate competing processes (that is, proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation). We have proposed that AP1 factors function differently in basal versus suprabasal epidermis. To test this, we inactivated suprabasal AP1 factor function in mouse epidermis by targeted expression of dominant-negative c-jun (TAM67), which inactivates function of all AP1 factors. This produces increased basal keratinocyte proliferation, delayed differentiation and extensive hyperkeratosis. These findings contrast with previous studies showing that basal layer AP1 factor inactivation does not perturb resting epidermis. It is interesting that in spite of extensive keratinocyte hyperproliferation, susceptibility to carcinogen-dependent tumor induction is markedly attenuated. These novel observations strongly suggest that AP1 factors have distinct roles in the basal versus suprabasal epidermis, confirm that AP1 factor function is required for normal terminal differentiation, and suggest that AP1 factors have a different role in normal epidermis versus cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2115761121,"Synaptotagmins are known to mediate diverse forms of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis through their C2 domains, but the principles underlying functional differentiation among them are unclear. Synaptotagmin-1 functions as a Ca2+ sensor in neurotransmitter release at central nervous system synapses, but synaptotagmin-7 does not, and yet both isoforms act as Ca2+ sensors in chromaffin cells. To shed light into this apparent paradox, we have performed rescue experiments in neurons from synaptotagmin-1 knockout mice using a chimera that contains the synaptotagmin-1 sequence with its C2B domain replaced by the synaptotagmin-7 C2B domain (Syt1/7). Rescue was not achieved either with the WT Syt1/7 chimera or with nine mutants where residues that are distinct in synaptotagmin-7 were restored to those present in synaptotagmin-1. To investigate whether these results arise because of unique conformational features of the synaptotagmin-7 C2B domain, we determined its crystal structure at 1.44 A resolution. The synaptotagmin-7 C2B domain structure is very similar to that of the synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain and contains three Ca2+-binding sites. Two of the Ca2+-binding sites of the synaptotagmin-7 C2B domain are also present in the synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain and have analogous ligands to those determined for the latter by NMR spectroscopy, suggesting that a discrepancy observed in a crystal structure of the synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain arose from crystal contacts. Overall, our results suggest that functional differentiation in synaptotagmins arises in part from subtle sequence changes that yield dramatic functional differences."
https://openalex.org/W2120168892,"Because many species-specific phenotypic differences are assumed to be caused by differential regulation of gene expression, many recent investigations have focused on measuring transcript abundance. Despite the availability of high-throughput platforms, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-QPCR) is often the method of choice because of its low cost and wider dynamic range. However, the accuracy of this technique heavily relies on the use of multiple valid control genes for normalization. We created a pipeline for choosing genes potentially useful as RT-QPCR control genes for measuring expression between human and chimpanzee samples across multiple tissues, using published microarrays and a measure of tissue-specificity. We identified 13 genes from the pipeline and from commonly used control genes: ACTB, USP49, ARGHGEF2, GSK3A, TBP, SDHA, EIF2B2, GPDH, YWHAZ, HPTR1, RPL13A, HMBS, and EEF2. We then tested these candidate genes and validated their expression stability across species. We established the rank order of the most preferable set of genes for single and combined tissues. Our results suggest that for at least three tissues (cerebral cortex, liver, and skeletal muscle), EIF2B2, EEF2, HMBS, and SDHA are useful genes for normalizing human and chimpanzee expression using RT-QPCR. Interestingly, other commonly used control genes, including TBP, GAPDH, and, especially ACTB do not perform as well. This pipeline could be easily adapted to other species for which expression data exist, providing taxonomically appropriate control genes for comparisons of gene expression among species."

However, the temporal sequence of the distributed cortical activity contributing to iCNV generation remains unclear. During iCNV generation, selectively enhanced low-beta activity has been reported. Here we studied the temporal order of activation foci in cortical regions assumed to underlie iCNV generation using source reconstruction of low-beta (13–18 Hz) activity. During the iCNV, elicited by a cued simple reaction-time task, low-beta power peaked first (750 ms after cue onset) in anterior frontal and limbic regions and last (140 ms later) in posterior areas. This activity occurred 3300 ms before target onset and provides evidence for the temporally ordered involvement of both cognitive-control and motor-preparation processes already at early stages during the preparation for speeded action."

To address this, we expressed RP3 in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking key classical and noncanonical NF-κB signaling components. In wild-type MEFs, RP3 upregulated CCL2, CXCL1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and tumor necrosis factor expression and activated classical but not noncanonical NF-κB. RP3-activated NF-κB in IκB kinase (IKK)β−/− MEFs but not IKKα- or NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-deficient cells and activation was inhibited by a peptide that blocks NEMO binding to the IKKs. RP3 increased the levels of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and did not activate NF-κB in NIK-deficient MEFs. Notably, NIK stabilization was not accompanied by TRAF3 degradation demonstrating that RP3 disrupts normal basal NIK regulation. Dominant-negative NIK blocked RP3-induced NF-κB activation and an RP3 signaling mutant (RP3Y588F) did not stabilize NIK. Finally, examination of PTC specimens revealed strong positive staining for NIK. We therefore conclude that RP3 activates classical NF-κB via NIK, NEMO and IKKα. Importantly, our findings reveal a novel mechanism for oncogene-induced NF-κB activation via stabilization of NIK."

Aberrations of BCL11B locus leading to abnormal gene transcription were identified in human hematological disorders and corresponding animal models. Recently, the elevated levels of Bcl11b protein have been described in a subset of squameous cell carcinoma cases. Despite the rapidly accumulating knowledge concerning Bcl11b biology, the contribution of this protein to normal or transformed cell homeostasis remains open.Here, by employing an overexpression strategy we revealed formerly unidentified features of Bcl11b. Two different T-cell lines were forced to express BCL11B at levels similar to those observed in primary T-cell leukemias. This resulted in markedly increased resistance to radiomimetic drugs while no influence on death-receptor apoptotic pathway was observed. Apoptosis resistance triggered by BCL11B overexpression was accompanied by a cell cycle delay caused by accumulation of cells at G1. This cell cycle restriction was associated with upregulation of CDKN1C (p57) and CDKN2C (p18) cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors. Moreover, p27 and p130 proteins accumulated and the SKP2 gene encoding a protein of the ubiquitin-binding complex responsible for their degradation was repressed. Furthermore, the expression of the MYCN oncogene was silenced which resulted in significant depletion of the protein in cells expressing high BCL11B levels. Both cell cycle restriction and resistance to DNA-damage-induced apoptosis coincided and required the histone deacetylase binding N-terminal domain of Bcl11b. The sensitivity to genotoxic stress could be restored by the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatine A.The data presented here suggest a potential role of BCL11B in tumor survival and encourage developing Bcl11b-inhibitory approaches as a potential tool to specifically target chemoresistant tumor cells."
https://openalex.org/W1975046168,"Overexpression of Ras(V12) in MCF10A cells, an immortalized mammary epithelial cell line, leads to transformation of these cells. We demonstrate that this is accompanied by degradation of C/EBPbeta1. C/EBPbeta is a transcription factor in which three protein isoforms exist because of alternative translation at three in-frame methionines. When C/EBPbeta1 is expressed in MCF10A-Ras(V12) cells, immunoblot analysis reveals that C/EBPbeta1 is degraded in these cells. Treatment of MCF10A-Ras(V12)-C/EBPbeta1 cells with the cdk inhibitor roscovitine leads to stabilization of C/EBPbeta1. It has been previously shown that cdk2 phosphorylates C/EBPbeta on Thr235. We demonstrate that mutation of Thr235 to alanine in C/EBPbeta1 is sufficient to restore the stability of C/EBPbeta1 expression in MCF10A-Ras(V12) cells. Overexpression of Ras(V12) in primary cells induces senescence rather than transformation, thus suppressing tumorigenesis. C/EBPbeta is required for Ras(V12)-induced senescence in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Upregulation of interleukin-6 (IL6) by C/EBPbeta has been shown to be necessary for oncogene-induced senescence, but the specific isoform of C/EBPbeta has not been investigated. We show that the C/EBPbeta1 isoform upregulates IL6 when introduced into normal fibroblasts. In addition, we show that C/EBPbeta1 induces senescence. Taken together, degradation of C/EBPbeta1 by Ras activation may represent a mechanism to bypass OIS."
https://openalex.org/W2089567938,"HU a small, basic, histone like protein is a major component of the bacterial nucleoid. E. coli has two subunits of HU coded by hupA and hupB genes whereas Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has only one subunit of HU coded by ORF Rv2986c (hupB gene). One noticeable feature regarding Mtb HupB, based on sequence alignment of HU orthologs from different bacteria, was that HupB(Mtb) bears at its C-terminal end, a highly basic extension and this prompted an examination of its role in Mtb HupB function.With this objective two clones of Mtb HupB were generated; one expressing full length HupB protein (HupB(Mtb)) and another which expresses only the N terminal region (first 95 amino acid) of hupB (HupB(MtbN)). Gel retardation assays revealed that HupB(MtbN) is almost like E. coli HU (heat stable nucleoid protein) in terms of its DNA binding, with a binding constant (K(d)) for linear dsDNA greater than 1000 nM, a value comparable to that obtained for the HUalphaalpha and HUalphabeta forms. However CTR (C-terminal Region) of HupB(Mtb) imparts greater specificity in DNA binding. HupB(Mtb) protein binds more strongly to supercoiled plasmid DNA than to linear DNA, also this binding is very stable as it provides DNase I protection even up to 5 minutes. Similar results were obtained when the abilities of both proteins to mediate protection against DNA strand cleavage by hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton's reaction, were compared. It was also observed that both the proteins have DNA binding preference for A:T rich DNA which may occur at the regulatory regions of ORFs and the oriC region of Mtb.These data thus point that HupB(Mtb) may participate in chromosome organization in-vivo, it may also play a passive, possibly an architectural role."
https://openalex.org/W2005946855,"Years of developing cancer therapies targeted to specific molecular drivers have yielded some crucial advances, yet only 5% of such therapies tested in the clinic prove efficacious, indicating a need for marked improvement in predictive preclinical research1. Given that cancers are complex diseases with diverse molecular etiologies, the most predictive preclinical models require accurate engineering for the induction of cancer in situ.

Recently, several studies in such genetically engineered mice (GEM) have shown promise for obtaining insight into clinical challenges to diagnosis and treatment and for guiding clinical research. One such breakthrough occurred in evaluating therapeutics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma2, a deadly cancer with no effective treatment, where mice with inducible genetic aberrations common to the human disease specifically in the pancreatic ductal epithelium developed pancreatic cancers that are histopathologically similar to those in humans3.

In particular, the study by Olive et al.2 used a GEM pancreatic cancer model to uncover a potential major impediment to the treatment of these cancers—their relative impermeability to drug perfusion. These mice were engineered to incorporate targeted point mutations in the genetic loci of the endogenous oncoprotein Kras and the tumor suppressor p53, which are found in 95% and 75% of human ductal pancreatic tumors, respectively. When mice with in situ cancers in the pancreas were treated with gemcitabine (Gemzar, Eli Lilly), the standard of care for ductal pancreatic cancer, responses were minimal, just as observed in the clinic. When tumors were examined over time for vascular delivery of the drug, tissue perfusion within the tumor was minimal. In fact, the vasculature in these cancers was both sparse and poorly functional, probably explaining the poor perfusion of gemcitabine in the tumor and the lack of therapeutic effect.

To test whether altering the stroma to increase perfusion would also increase the drug efficacy, tumor-bearing mice (identified by ultrasound or imaging) were treated with a Smoothened inhibitor (IPI-926, Infinity Pharmaceuticals) ten days before treatment with gemcitabine. Smoothened is a mediator of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, which forms a paracrine signaling axis in pancreatic cancers4-6. The Sonic Hedgehog ligand is overexpressed and released from neoplastic epithelial cells and activates downstream signaling in nearby stromal cells, promoting desmoplasia, a dense, fibrous tumor stroma7.

Remarkably, the inhibition of Smoothened depleted the stroma from established tumors and facilitated the delivery of multiple drug agents, resulting in a more than twofold increase in survival of mice when it was administered in combination with gemcitabine, compared with mice that did not receive the Smoothened inhibitor2 (Fig. 1).

The results of the study by Olive et al.2 are striking for several reasons. First, if the model is, in fact, representative of the human disease, the observation that pancreatic cancers are resistant to drug uptake may explain why virtually every therapy tested for this disease has failed8 and represents, therefore, a breakthrough in advancing therapeutic effectiveness. Second, the use of the GEM model facilitated testing for therapeutic agents that promote effective drug delivery, resulting in the development of a protocol for combined therapy that targets both the microenvironment, with the Smoothened inhibitor, and the tumor cells, with gemcitabine. Finally, this study2 showed the importance of using relevant models for preclinical assessment.

It was crucial in the study2 to use a mouse model in which cancer developed de novo, evolving within the natural microenvironment and mimicking the pancreatic tumor development in humans. Tumors derived from human pancreatic cancer cells implanted under the skin of immunocompromised mice—the standard in preclinical evaluation—were well perfused and responsive to gemcitabine2. It is unlikely that de novo cancer models will be required for effective preclinical therapeutic assessment of all cancers. Nevertheless, given that we understand so little about stromal interactions during tumor progression, therapeutic studies in de novo cancer models may be required for all cancers to assess the full range of treatment possibilities.

Despite the intriguing and promising possibilities for human disease management suggested by the GEM pancreatic cancer studies, a question arises about whether outcomes in the cancer mouse model predict a real human disease mechanism. Answering this crucial question requires research in humans. The mouse studies, however, have provided a hypothesis to test in the clinic.

More important, these basic findings in mouse models are en route to be tested in drug efficacy studies in humans by several investigators, underscoring that relevant preclinical findings can be translated into clinical research design. For instance, trials influenced or guided by the preclinical mouse studies currently include a phase 1b-2 trial of gemcitabine with IPI-926 versus vehicle in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and four trials of GDC-0449 (an inhibitor of Smoothened; Vismodegib, Genentech-Roche) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma: a phase 1 toxicity study, carried out at the Mayo Clinic, in combination with gemcitabine and erlotinib (Tarceva, Genentech-Roche), a pilot study by the National Cancer Institute on the effects of GDC-0449 plus gemcitabine on circulating tumors cells, a phase 2 study of gemcitabine plus GDC0449 versus vehicle at the University of Chicago and a phase 2 trial of gemcitabine in combination with GDC0449 and Abraxane (Abraxis Pharmaceuticals) at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital (http://clinicaltrials.gov/).

In addition, a phase 1 study of GDC0449 in presurgical patients at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute will acquire before-after-treatment biopsies from locally confined tumors to directly evaluate the changes in stroma and vasculature that were predicted by the mouse studies by Olive et al.2. Furthermore, recent promising phase 2 results with the combination of abraxane and gemcitabine in individuals with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (D.D. Von Hoff (Translational Genomics Research Institute), personal communication) raise the question as to whether abraxane might also act similarly by targeting the stroma. Considering that the study by Olive et al.2 is over a year old, this is a remarkably rapid turnaround for the translation of a preclinical finding into clinical trials.

The mouse studies have shown that drug-induced stromal modification can be used to improve overall drug delivery. It is a major advance to incorporate such basic preclinical findings so quickly into the design and interpretation of human studies. Results from the above clinical trials and their successors, however, will be required to know how well studies in a biologically and genetically relevant mouse cancer model can predict clinical outcomes.

In addition to predicting efficacy, the mouse studies proposed a mechanism that can now be evaluated directly in the earliest clinical trials. This upends the traditional clinical trial pathway in which molecular mechanisms are usually sought, that is, only after large-scale efficacy trials have been successful.

In the best scenario, these early clinical trials will find both signs of efficacy and data in support of a molecular mechanism. At worst, the samples generated in human trials will allow a better understanding of why the drugs failed."
https://openalex.org/W2095023091,"A number of amyloid diseases involve deposition of extracellular protein aggregates, which are implicated in mechanisms of cell damage and death. However, the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood.Here we use the yeast prion protein Ure2 as a generic model to investigate how amyloid-like protein aggregates can enter mammalian cells and convey cytotoxicity. The effect of three different states of Ure2 protein (native dimer, protofibrils and mature fibrils) was tested on four mammalian cell lines (SH-SY5Y, MES23.5, HEK-293 and HeLa) when added extracellularly to the medium. Immunofluorescence using a polyclonal antibody against Ure2 showed that all three protein states could enter the four cell lines. In each case, protofibrils significantly inhibited the growth of the cells in a dose-dependent manner, fibrils showed less toxicity than protofibrils, while the native state had no effect on cell growth. This suggests that the structural differences between the three protein states lead to their different effects upon cells. Protofibrils of Ure2 increased membrane conductivity, altered calcium homeostasis, and ultimately induced apoptosis. The use of standard inhibitors suggested uptake into mammalian cells might occur via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In order to investigate this further, we used the chicken DT40 B cell line DKOR, which allows conditional expression of clathrin. Uptake into the DKOR cell-line was reduced when clathrin expression was repressed suggesting similarities between the mechanism of PrP uptake and the mechanism observed here for Ure2.The results provide insight into the mechanisms by which amyloid aggregates may cause pathological effects in prion and amyloid diseases."

The human protein kinase X (PrKX) is an exemption as it is inhibited only by pseudosubstrate inhibitors, i.e. RIα or RIβ but not by substrate inhibitors RIIα or RIIβ. Detailed examination of the capacity of five PrKX-like kinases ranging from human to protozoa (Trypanosoma brucei) to form holoenzymes with human R subunits in living cells shows that this preference for pseudosubstrate inhibitors is evolutionarily conserved. To elucidate the molecular basis of this inhibitory pattern, we applied bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and surface plasmon resonance in combination with site-directed mutagenesis. We observed that the conserved αH-αI loop residue Arg-283 in PrKX is crucial for its RI over RII preference, as a R283L mutant was able to form a holoenzyme complex with wild type RII subunits. Changing the corresponding αH-αI loop residue in PKA Cα (L277R), significantly destabilized holoenzyme complexes in vitro, as cAMP-mediated holoenzyme activation was facilitated by a factor of 2-4, and lead to a decreased affinity of the mutant C subunit for R subunits, significantly affecting RII containing holoenzymes."

Methodology/Principal Findings Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity (PARylation) by either PJ-34 or 5-AIQ resulted in developmental arrest of fertilized embryos at the PNEB. PARylation inhibition affects spindle bundle formation and phosphorylation of Erk molecules of metaphase II (MII) unfertilized oocytes. We found a frequent appearance of multiple pronuclei (PN) in the PARylation-inhibited embryos, suggesting defective polymerization of tubulins. Attenuated phosphorylation of lamin A/C by PARylation was detected in the PARylation-inhibited embryos at PNEB. This was associated with sustained localization of heterodomain protein 1 (HP1) at the PN of the one-cell embryos arrested by PARylation inhibition. Conclusions/Significance Our findings indicate that PARylation is required for pronuclear fusion during postfertilization processes. These data further suggest that PARylation regulates protein dynamics essential for the beginning of mouse zygotic development.

The structure of PepD was found to exist as a homodimer, in which each monomer comprises a catalytic domain containing two zinc ions at the active site center for its hydrolytic function and a lid domain utilizing hydrogen bonds between helices to form the dimer interface. Although the PepD is structurally similar to PepV, which exists as a monomer, putative substrate-binding residues reside in different topological regions of the polypeptide chain. In addition, the lid domain of the PepD contains an “extra” domain not observed in related M20 family metallopeptidases with a dimeric structure. Mutational assays confirmed both the putative di-zinc allocations and the architecture of substrate recognition. In addition, the catalytic domain-alone truncated PepDCAT exhibited substrate specificity to l-homocarnosine compared with that of the wild-type PepD, indicating a potential value in applications of PepDCAT for GABAergic therapies or neuroprotection. Aminoacylhistidine dipeptidases (PepD, EC 3.4.13.3) belong to the family of M20 metallopeptidases from the metallopeptidase H clan that catalyze a broad range of dipeptide and tripeptide substrates, including l-carnosine and l-homocarnosine.

Metallopeptidases of the M20 family from the metallopeptidase H clan play diverse functions throughout all kingdoms of life, ranging from a general role in the hydrolysis of late products of protein degradation to specific biochemical functions in protein maturation, tissue repair, and cell-cycle control (1Chen S.L.

The substrates of PepD and carnosinases, l-carnosine and related Xaa-His dipeptides, are naturally occurring dipeptides involved in many biological pathways. Although the physiological role of l-carnosine is still uncertain, studies have indicated that l-carnosine exhibits a range of cytoprotective properties (26Boldyrev A.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 65: 751-756PubMed Google Scholar) that support its role as a cytosolic buffer (27Vaughan F.L. Hughes E.A. Jones R.S. Woods R.T. Tipper S.P. J. Int. Neuropsychol.

We have previously cloned and sequenced a biofilm-related and carnosine-hydrolyzing pepD gene from Vibrio alginolyticus (36Wang T.Y. Chen Y.C. Kao L.W. Chang C.Y. Wang Y.K. Liu Y.H. Feng J.M. Wu T.K.

The V. alginolyticus PepD has a broader specificity for Xaa-His dipeptides and is sensitive to inhibition by bestatine and l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (36Wang T.Y. Chen Y.C. Kao L.W. Chang C.Y.

Nevertheless, sequence analysis revealed that putative active site residues for catalysis are conserved in PepD and related di-zinc enzymes in the M20 family (6Jozic D. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H.

His80, Asp119, Glu150, Asp173, and His461 were predicted to be involved in metal binding, whereas Asp82 and Glu149 were predicted to be necessary for catalysis. Each of these residues were completely conserved, with the exception of Asp173. Asp173 was present in homologs with aminopeptidase/dipeptidase specificity, although members of aminoacylase/carboxypeptidase contained a glutamic acid in the same position (36Wang T.Y. Chen Y.C.

These enzymes have all exhibited an overall two-domain organization, a di-zinc binding catalytic domain, and a typical smaller domain. Nevertheless, CPG2 and mouse CN2 are able to form homodimers, whereas PepV appears to exist only as a monomer (6Jozic D. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Scholze H. Dive V. Henrich B. Huber R. Bode W.

Although the biochemical activity of V. alginolyticus PepD has been well characterized, the structure-reaction mechanisms have not been studied in detail. Furthermore, little is known concerning the substrate specificity between l-carnosine and l-homocarnosine in PepD-catalyzed reactions. We present herein the three-dimensional structure and putative substrate-binding residues of the V. alginolyticus PepD. We performed site-directed mutagenesis to determine which residues are involved in di-zinc metal ion binding and contribute to the architecture necessary for substrate C terminus binding and recognition. Furthermore, we found that the catalytic domain alone was sufficient for altering substrate specificity toward l-homocarnosine. Characterization of the PepD enzyme active-site architecture will aid in future studies to identify residues that may be modified to yield alternative substrate recognition properties and improve the potential therapeutic value of this protein and its closely related family members. Site-directed mutagenesis of the V. alginolyticus pepD gene was carried out using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Mutagenic primers were designed for use with the pET-28a(+)-pepD plasmid (wild-type) template (as described below). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing using the dideoxy chain termination method and the ABI PRISM 3100 autosequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The recombinant mutant plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cells for expression of the mutated PepD proteins. The truncated V. alginolyticus PepD catalytic domain gene (pepDCAT) was composed of the pepD gene sequence of nucleotides 1–558 and 1203–1470. An 826-bp fragment, which included 558 bp of the 5′-end and 268 bp of the 3′-end of the pepD gene, was amplified by PCR using the following primer pairs: CYC-PepD-BamHI-1 (sense primer, 5′-CGGGATCCGTGTCTGAGTTCCATTCTG-3′) and CYC-PepDcat-4 (antisense primer, 5′-TCCAGCCTGGTCCTGCACAACCCATGTACAC-3′), and by CYC-PepDcat-3 (sense primer, 5′-TGGGTTGTGCAGGACCAGGCTGGAAACCAGATG-3′) and CYC-PepD-XhoI-2 (antisense primer, 5′-CGCTCGAGTTACGCCTTTTCAGGAATG-3′). The PCR product was subcloned into pET-28a(+) to generate a recombinant plasmid, pET-28a(+)-pepDCAT, which was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS competent cells for the production of the PepD catalytic domain protein (PepDCAT). Both the PepD and PepDCAT proteins were produced and purified in the same manner. Colonies grown on an LB plate were inoculated into LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml of kanamycin and grown at 37 °C until A600 of 0.5–0.6 was reached. At this point, protein production was induced by the addition of isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm, and the culture was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 4 h before harvest. The cells were collected by centrifugation and then resuspended in 15 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl. The mixture was sonicated, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing recombinant proteins was loaded onto a Ni-SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow column (GH Healthcare) previously prepared by washing with 10 column volumes of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, pH 7.0) containing 20 mm imidazole. The protein-loaded column was first washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A + 20 mm imidazole, then with 5 column volumes of buffer A containing 70, 200, or 500 mm imidazole. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected, and the protein concentration in each fraction was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with BSA as the standard. Fractions containing PepD enzymatic activity were pooled and dialyzed twice against 2 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The purified recombinant proteins were stored at −80 °C for up to 6 months without loss of activity. The enzymatic activity was assayed according to the method described by Teufel et al. (13Teufel M. Saudek V. Ledig J.P. Bernhardt A. Boularand S. Carreau A. Cairns N.J. Carter C. Cowley D.J. Duverger D. Ganzhorn A.J. Guenet C. Heintzelmann B. Laucher V. Sauvage C. Smirnova T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6521-6531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), which is based on the measurement of a histidine product by O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) modification. Substrate hydrolysis was carried out in a final volume of 200 μl containing 80 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 100 μl of 2 mm l-carnosine (dissolved in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0), and 20 μl of purified enzyme (20 μm). The reaction was initiated by the addition of substrate and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1% trichloroacetic acid after a 30-min incubation at room temperature. Next, 50 μl of 5 mg/ml of OPA dissolved in 2 m NaOH was added to derivatize the liberated histidine, and the reaction was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in darkness. The fluorescence of the OPA-derivatized l-histidine was measured using Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) (λExc, 355 nm and λEm, 460 nm). Reactions with only l-histidine or only l-carnosine were treated in parallel to serve as positive and negative controls, respectively. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. For determination of Vmax, Km, and kcat of V. alginolyticus PepD wild-type and mutant proteins, the method described by Csámpai et al. (41Csámpai A. Kutlán D. Tóth F. Molnár-Perl I. J. Chromatogr. A. 2004; 1031: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) was slightly modified for use with HPLC and fluorescence detection. Different concentrations of substrate (0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5, and 10 mm) were added to a nanomolar concentration of enzyme solution in 200 μl at pH 7.4 for 20 min at 37 °C. The liberated histidine was derivatized with 100 μl of OPA reagent for 5 min at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was detected as described previously. The substrate conversion did not exceed 20%. A total of nine substrate concentration points were used for each determination. The data collected were applied to the Lineweaver-Burk equation. The kcat/Km values reflect values assuming 100% activity of the enzyme preparation. All reactions were carried out in triplicate. Various Xaa-His dipeptides (100 μl, 2 mm) including β-Ala-l-His (l-carnosine), α-Ala-His, Gly-His, Val-His, Leu-His, Ile-His, Tyr-His, Ser-His, β-Asp-His, and γ-aminobutyryl-His (GABA-His, l-homocarnosine), two His-Xaa dipeptides (His-Asp and His-Arg), and two histidine-containing tripeptides (Gly-Gly-His and Gly-His-Gly) were used to investigate the substrate specificity of PepDCAT. The reaction solutions were incubated for 25 min at 37 °C and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of OPA solution. Catalytic activity was analyzed spectrofluorimetrically, as described above. The activity measured for l-carnosine was defined as 100%. Crystallization of PepD was performed at 291 K by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method against a reservoir solution containing PEG 400 (28%, v/v), 0.2 m CaCl2 and 0.1 m Na-HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), as described previously (37Chang C.Y. Hsieh Y.C. Wang T.Y. Chen C.J. Wu T.K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2009; 65: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Crystals of a diamond shape appeared within six months and grew to maximum dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.1 mm3. The protein crystals were transferred to the cryoprotectant solution containing glycerol (15%, v/v) prior to the x-ray diffraction experiment. Diffraction data were collected to 3.0-Å resolution on SPXF beamline BL13B1 at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center (NSRRC) in Taiwan and beamline BL12B2 at SPring-8 in Japan. The data were processed using the HKL2000 suite (42Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38446) Google Scholar). The redundancy independent merging R factor (Rr.i.m.) and the precision indicating merging R factor (Rp.i.m.) were calculated using the program RMERGE (43Weiss M.S. J. Appl. Cryst. 2001; 34: 130-135Crossref Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 44Evans P. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3723) Google Scholar). The crystals belong to space group P65 with unit cell parameters a = 80.42 Å and c = 303.11 Å. The asymmetric unit contained two protein molecules, corresponding to a solvent content of 53.4%. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with MOLREP (CCP4) using the structure of Xaa-His dipeptidase from Haemophilus somnus 129PT (PDB code 2QYV) as the search model. The 2QYV was solved and deposited with the PDB by the Joint Center of Structure Genomics (JCSG), but was never published. The orientation of the lid domain was first located and fixed, subsequently leading to the determination of the relative position of the single catalytic domain. For structural refinement, the model was built using WinCOOT and refined using REFMAC5 (CCP4) to give the final Rwork = 0.231 and Rfree = 0.274, respectively (45Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23012) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab The crystal structure of V. alginolyticus PepD was solved by the molecular replacement method and refined to a resolution of 3.0 Å with an R factor of 23.1% and an Rfree factor of 27.4% (Table 1). The overall structure of the PepD monomer is comprised of a total of 486 residues in two domains: an N-terminal catalytic domain harboring two zinc ions for catalysis and a C-terminal lid domain for substrate binding and protein dimerization (Fig. 1A). The x-ray absorption measurement and electron density map confirmed the presence and locations of Zn2+ ions (supplemental Fig. S1). The high B-factors could be due to the flexible opened conformation between the catalytic and lid domains. PepD was also found to share similar structural folds with the PepV and related di-zinc-dependent M20/M28 family of enzymes, despite low sequence similarities among each. PepD and PepV showed root mean square deviations of 4.0 and 4.3 Å for Cα atoms of the catalytic and lid domains, respectively. Two PepD molecules were found to be packed as a dimer in the asymmetric unit with dimensions of ∼90 × 90 × 95 Å (Fig. 1B). The dimeric and monomeric characteristics of native and denatured PepD were also supported by evidence from analytical"
https://openalex.org/W2065041177,"Over time, organisms developed various strategies to adapt to their environment. Circadian clocks are thought to have evolved to adjust to the predictable rhythms of the light-dark cycle caused by the rotation of the Earth around its own axis. The rhythms these clocks generate persist even in the absence of environmental cues with a period of about 24 hours. To tick in time, they continuously synchronize themselves to the prevailing photoperiod by appropriate phase shifts. In this study, we disrupted two molecular components of the mammalian circadian oscillator, Rev-Erbalpha and Period1 (Per1). We found that mice lacking these genes displayed robust circadian rhythms with significantly shorter periods under constant darkness conditions. Strikingly, they showed high amplitude resetting in response to a brief light pulse at the end of their subjective night phase, which is rare in mammals. Surprisingly, Cry1, a clock component not inducible by light in mammals, became slightly inducible in these mice. Taken together, Rev-Erbalpha and Per1 may be part of a mechanism preventing drastic phase shifts in mammals."
https://openalex.org/W2157278787,"Background Eyewitness recalls and accident records frequently do not mention the conditions and behaviors of interest to researchers and lead to missing values and to uncertainty about the prevalence of these conditions and behaviors surrounding accidents. Missing values may occur because eyewitnesses report the presence but not the absence of obvious clues/accident features. We examined this possibility. Methodology/Principal Findings Participants watched car accident videos and were asked to recall as much information as they could remember about each accident. The results showed that eyewitnesses were far more likely to report the presence of present obvious clues than the absence of absent obvious clues even though they were aware of their absence. Conclusions One of the principal mechanisms causing missing values may be eyewitnesses' tendency to not report the absence of obvious features. We discuss the implications of our findings for both retrospective and prospective analyses of accident records, and illustrate the consequences of adopting inappropriate assumptions about the meaning of missing values using the Avaluator Avalanche Accident Prevention Card."
https://openalex.org/W2020117883,"Large-scale gene expression studies have not yielded the expected insight into genetic networks that control complex processes. These anticipated discoveries have been limited not by technology, but by a lack of effective strategies to investigate the data in a manageable and meaningful way. Previous work suggests that using a pre-determined seed-network of gene relationships to query large-scale expression datasets is an effective way to generate candidate genes for further study and network expansion or enrichment. Based on the evolutionary conservation of gene relationships, we test the hypothesis that a seed network derived from studies of retinal cell determination in the fly, Drosophila melanogaster, will be an effective way to identify novel candidate genes for their role in mouse retinal development.Our results demonstrate that a number of gene relationships regulating retinal cell differentiation in the fly are identifiable as pairwise correlations between genes from developing mouse retina. In addition, we demonstrate that our extracted seed-network of correlated mouse genes is an effective tool for querying datasets and provides a context to generate hypotheses. Our query identified 46 genes correlated with our extracted seed-network members. Approximately 54% of these candidates had been previously linked to the developing brain and 33% had been previously linked to the developing retina. Five of six candidate genes investigated further were validated by experiments examining spatial and temporal protein expression in the developing retina.We present an effective strategy for pursuing a systems biology approach that utilizes an evolutionary comparative framework between two model organisms, fly and mouse. Future implementation of this strategy will be useful to determine the extent of network conservation, not just gene conservation, between species and will facilitate the use of prior biological knowledge to develop rational systems-based hypotheses."
https://openalex.org/W2082970268,"The development of an HIV/AIDS vaccine has proven to be elusive. Because human vaccine trials have not yet demonstrated efficacy, new vaccine strategies are needed for the HIV vaccine pipeline. We have been developing a new HIV vaccine platform using a live enterovirus, coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) vector. Enteroviruses are ideal candidates for development as a vaccine vector for oral delivery, because these viruses normally enter the body via the oral route and survive the acidic environment of the stomach.We constructed a live coxsackievirus B4 recombinant, CVB4/p24(73(3)), that expresses seventy-three amino acids of the gag p24 sequence (HXB2) and assessed T cell responses after immunization of mice. The CVB4 recombinant was physically stable, replication-competent, and genetically stable. Oral or intraperitoneal immunization with the recombinant resulted in strong systemic gag p24-specific T cell responses as determined by the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay and by multiparameter flow cytometry. Oral immunization with CVB4/p24(73(3)) resulted in a short-lived, localized infection of the gut without systemic spread. Because coxsackieviruses are ubiquitous in the human population, we also evaluated whether the recombinant was able to induce gag p24-specific T cell responses in mice pre-immunized with the CVB4 vector. We showed that oral immunization with CVB4/p24(73(3)) induced gag p24-specific immune responses in vector-immune mice.The CVB4/p24(73(3)) recombinant retained the physical and biological characteristics of the parental CVB4 vector. Oral immunization with the CVB4 recombinant was safe and resulted in the induction of systemic HIV-specific T cell responses. Furthermore, pre-existing vector immunity did not preclude the development of gag p24-specific T cell responses. As the search continues for new vaccine strategies, the present study suggests that live CVB4/HIV recombinants are potential new vaccine candidates for HIV."
