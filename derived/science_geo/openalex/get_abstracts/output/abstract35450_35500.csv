https://openalex.org/W1482432683,"The conversion of cholesterol into bile acids in the liver represents the major catabolic pathway for the removal of cholesterol from the body. In this complex biosynthetic pathway, at least 10 enzymes modify both the ring structure and side chain of cholesterol, resulting in the formation of the primary bile acids, cholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. To gain insight into the details and regulation of this pathway, we have used protein sequencing and molecular cloning techniques to isolate and characterize a cDNA encoding the rabbit mitochondrial sterol 26-hydroxylase. This enzyme catalyzes the first step in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates in the biosynthesis of bile acids. The structure of the sterol 26-hydroxylase, as deduced by both DNA sequence analysis of the cDNA and protein sequence analysis, reveals it to be a mitochondrial cytochrome P-450. A signal sequence of 36 residues precedes a coding region of 499 amino acids, predicting a molecular weight of 56,657 for the mature protein. The identity of the 26-hydroxylase cDNA was further confirmed by expression in monkey COS cells employing a versatile eukaryotic expression vector. Blotting experiments revealed that the mRNA for this enzyme is expressed in many tissues and that it is encoded by a low copy number gene in the rabbit genome."
https://openalex.org/W2092974248,"The genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV contains an efficient ribosomal frameshifting signal at the junction of two overlapping open reading frames. We have defined by deletion analysis an 86 nucleotide sequence encompassing the overlap region which is sufficient to allow frameshifting in a heterologous context. The upstream boundary of the signal consists of the sequence UUUAAAC, which is the likely site of ribosomal slippage. We show by creation of complementary nucleotide changes that the RNA downstream of this “slippery” sequence folds into a tertiary structure termed a pseudoknot, the formation of which is essential for efficient frameshifting."
https://openalex.org/W1979801990,"Stimulation of transcription of reporter genes by the progesterone receptor (PR) was inhibited in transfected HeLa cells by co-expressing the estrogen receptor (ER) in an ER-dose- and estrogen-dependent manner. Both the N-terminal region and the hormone binding domain of ER were involved in this inhibition, which was antagonized by antiestrogens and did not appear to involve direct interaction between ER and either reporter gene or PR. ER expression also inhibited activation by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and both PR and GR expression inhibited activation by ER, albeit to a lower extent. Similar transcriptional interference was observed between the endogenous PR and ER present in T47D and MCF-7 breast cancer cells transfected with an ER reporter gene. Moreover, transcription of the resident estrogen-induced pS2 gene was partially inhibited by exposing MCF-7 cells to progestins or glucocorticoids. We propose that these observations reflect competition for a functionally limiting transcription factor(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2152832510,"Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) and progressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO) are related neuromuscular disorders characterized by ocular myopathy and ophthalmoplegia. Almost all patients with KSS and about half with PEO harbor large deletions in their mitochondrial genomes. The deletions differ in both size and location, except for one, 5 kilobases long, that is found in more than one-third of all patients examined. This common deletion was found to be flanked by a perfect 13-base pair direct repeat in the normal mitochondrial genome. This result suggests that homologous recombination deleting large regions of intervening mitochondrial DNA, which previously had been observed only in lower eukaryotes and plants, operates in mammalian mitochondrial genomes as well, and is at least one cause of the deletions found in these two related mitochondrial myopathies."
https://openalex.org/W1989293984,"Mature mouse sperm cells incubated in an isotonic buffer with cloned DNA capture DNA molecules over a 15 min period. Spermatozoa incubated with pSV2CAT plasmid in either circular or linear form were used to fertilize mouse eggs in vitro. Sequences complementary to pSV2CAT were identified in ∼30% of 250 progeny by Southern blotting. A genomic library was constructed from the DNA of a positive mouse. Three positive clones were identified and two adjacent Hincll restriction fragments of 240 and 370 bp showed identical sequences to the corresponding fragments of the pSV2CAT plasmid. F1 progeny showed paternal and maternal transmission of the transgenes from founders. CAT gene expression was detected on tissues of adult F1 individuals, preferentially on tails and muscle. We conclude that transgenic mice can be obtained using sperm cells as foreign DNA vectors."

https://openalex.org/W2007040484,"Iron-responsive elements (IREs) are RNA motifs that have been identified within the 5' untranslated region of ferritin messenger RNA and the 3' untranslated region of transferrin receptor mRNA. A single IRE mediates iron-dependent control of ferritin translation, whereas multiple IREs are found in the region of the transferrin receptor mRNA responsible for iron-dependent control of mRNA stability. A cytosolic protein binds in vitro to the IREs of both mRNAs. The IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP) is shown to require free sulfhydryl groups for its specific interaction with the IRE. Treatment of lysates with reducing agents increases the binding activity, whereas agents that block sulfhydryls inhibit binding. Iron starvation, leading to decreased ferritin translation, results in increased binding activity, which is explained by an increase in the fraction of the IRE-BP that is in a fully reduced state."
https://openalex.org/W2020805433,"The structure of ribosomal chromatin in exponentially growing Friend cells, in stationary cells, and in metaphase chromosomes was studied by psoralen photocrosslinking. It is shown that in intact cells, two distinct types of ribosomal chromatin coexist in Friend cells, one that contains nucleosomes and represents the inactive copies and one that lacks a repeating structure and corresponds to the transcribed genes. A single gene copy is either in one or the other chromatin state. The relative amounts of the two types of structures are similar in interphase and metaphase, however, their run-on activities differ significantly. This suggests that the two states of chromatin are maintained independently of the transcriptional process and that they are stably propagated through the cell cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1501664771,"The reagent potassium permanganate is used to probe lac transcription complexes by primer extension-probing analysis. A series of strongly hyperreactive bands, corresponding to the known melted region, is observed when open complexes are formed in vitro. A nearly identical pattern occurs in vivo, the signal intensity of which increases when open complexes are trapped with rifampicin. Quantitative comparison of the signal intensity obtained under steady-state conditions with that obtained in the presence of rifampicin indicates that transcription from each of three lac promoter variants is limited in vivo principally by the slow rate of open complex formation. The slow-start lac L8:UV5 promoter is also limited somewhat by slow RNA chain initiation. Slightly different patterns of KMnO4 reactivity at each promoter variant in the absence of RNA polymerase in vitro suggest that DNA sequence dictates the ultimate pattern of melting, with the polymerase acting principally to stabilize the melted state specified by the DNA sequence."
https://openalex.org/W2054852170,"We have identified the regulatory sequences required for the periodic expression of the Drosophila pair rule gene even skipped (eve). We find that the gradually changing pattern of periodic eve expression during early embryogenesis is directed by two distinct regulatory programs. Initially, eve expression in individual stripes is established by different regulatory elements, each of which responds to nonperiodic spatial cues provided, at least in part, by the gap genes. Later, coordinate expression of eve in all seven stripes is directed by a single regulatory region that responds to periodic cues provided by primary pair rule genes, including eve itself. As a consequence of this two-step regulatory program, eve functions both in the establishment of the periodic pattern of gene expression and in the subsequent specification of parasegmental boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2019835723,"The AnTat 1.3A antigen gene expression site of T. brucei was cloned from genomic libraries of the 200 kb expressor chromosome. In addition to the antigen gene, it contains seven putative coding regions (ESAGs, for expression site-associated genes), as well as a RIME retroposon. The polypeptide encoded by ESAG 4 shows homology to yeast adenylate cyclase, and possesses structural features of a transmembrane protein. The expression site is transcribed by a pol I-like polymerase in the parasite bloodstream form only, but sequences similar to ESAGs 5, 4, and 2 are also transcribed constitutively elsewhere, by a polymerase sensitive to α-amanitin. Ultraviolet irradiation, which seems to block RNA processing, allows the tentative mapping of a transcription promoter about 45 kb upstream of the antigen gene."
https://openalex.org/W2054523950,"Polyclonal antibody F547 reacts with a bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and a human recombinant bFGF, but not with bovine acidic fibroblast growth factor. This antibody localized bFGF in the extracellular matrix of mouse skeletal muscle, primarily in the fiber endomysium, which includes the heparin-containing basal lamina. In mdx mouse muscle, which displays persistent regeneration, FGF levels in the extracellular matrix are higher than those in controls. Overabundance of matrix FGF in mdx muscles may be related to an increase in both satellite cell and regenerative activity in the dystrophic muscle and may help explain the benign phenotype of mdx animals compared with the genetically identical human Duchenne muscular dystrophy."

It is proposed that the cutting specificity is due to a combination of the complementarity of the diyne-ene portion of the aglycone with DNA secondary structures and stabilization by association of the thiobenzoate-carbohydrate tail with the minor groove."

https://openalex.org/W1545789263,"C57BL/6 mice bearing either a transplantable methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma or Lewis lung adenocarcinoma were passively immunized every other day with a rabbit immunoglobulin fraction raised against murine cachectin/tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Mice bearing methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma developed tumor-associated hypophagia that was attenuated by anticachectin immunoglobulin treatment. In the same tumor-bearing animals, anticachectin treatment also significantly reduced the extent of carcass protein and fat loss, and reduced tumor weight. Mice bearing Lewis lung adenocarcinoma did not develop significant anorexia or carcass lean tissue depletion as tumor growth progressed, but they lost carcass lipid. Treatment of Lewis lung adenocarcinoma bearing mice with anticachectin antibodies diminished the degree of carcass lipid depletion and prevented plasma hypertriglyceridemia. However, in both tumor models, anticachectin treatment did not affect either the development of anemia, hypoalbuminemia or the increase in serum amyloid P concentrations seen with increasing tumor burden. We conclude that an endogenous cachectin response, inhibitable by exogenously administered antibody, contributes to anorexia and to changes in body fat and protein metabolism in these tumor-bearing animals. Neutralizing endogenous cachectin production with antibodies offers the potential to reduce tissue wasting that is frequently associated with neoplastic disease, but it does not appear to affect all of the hematologic and acute phase responses in these murine tumor models."

https://openalex.org/W2002753607,"THE false-truffles (Hymenogastrales) are a group of basidomycetous fungi that produce underground truffle-like basidiocarps. They are generally believed to be independently derived from several mushroom lineages, but extensive morphological divergence often obscures recognition of these phylogenetic connections. Comparisons of mitochondrial DNA now demonstrate a surprisingly close relationship between species of false-truffles in the genus Rhizopogon (Hymenogastraceae) and the mushroom genus Suillus (Boletaceae). The striking morphological differences separating all Suillus species from Rhizopogon imply an acceleration in the rate of morphological change relative to molecular change during the evolution of these false-truffles from their mushroom ancestors. This acceleration can best be explained by rapid morphological divergence resulting from selective pressures which may have acted on a small number of developmental genes."
https://openalex.org/W2048186445,"The muring PL10 cDNA corresponds to a transcript expressed only in the male germ line. Its expression is developmentally regulated, with high levels of transcripts being present during the meiotic and haploid stages of spermatogenesis. The deduced protein is shown to be highly homologous to the murine translation initiation factor eIF-4A and to other proteins that are also homologous to eIF-4A, including the Drosophila protein vasa. By consensus sequence conservation and comparison of secondary structure predictions, putative mononucleotide binding and binding domains are proposed to be shared by all these proteins. Taken together, these results suggest a helicase function for PL10 protein similar to that of eIF-4A and suggest its possible role in a key step of the spermatogenic process. The possible significance of the similarity between the PL10 protein and the protein product of the maternal effect gene vasa is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1984764741,"We have isolated and characterized two new protein kinase C (PKC) genes from D. melanogaster. One, dPKC98F, maps to chromosome region 98F and displays over 60% amino acid sequence identity with members of a recently described ""PKC-related"" subfamily in mammals. The other, dPKC53E(ey), maps to region 53E4-7 on the second chromosome and lies within 50 kb of PKC gene previously characterized (dPKC). While dPKC98F transcripts are expressed throughout development, expression of the two genes mapping at cytogenetic location 53E is primarily in adults. dPKC98F and the previously reported 53E gene are transcribed predominantly in brain tissue. In contrast, dPKC53E(ey) is transcribed only in photoreceptor cells. We will discuss the significance of this tissue-specific localization with regard to phototransduction."

https://openalex.org/W1536043153,"Monocytes and macrophages produce bioactive lipids, such as platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PAF), that mediate inflammation. These cells synthesize PAF following their activation, but not constitutively. Previous studies have demonstrated that PAF accumulation is regulated by the activity of the synthetic enzymes. We observed that the accumulation of PAF in stimulated human monocytes decreased by 90% as they differentiated into macrophages. There was no decrease in the activities of the synthetic enzymes; however, the activity of the degradative enzyme, PAF acetylhydrolase, increased 260-fold. The increase in PAF acetylhydrolase activity appeared to result from a net increase in the synthesis of a new enzyme. These studies demonstrate a novel mechanism in which an increase of the degradative enzyme regulates the accumulation of PAF. This may be an important mechanism by which macrophages modulate inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1992476232,"When one views a two-dimensional parallel projection of dots on the surface of a rotating globe, the direction of rotation is ambiguous, and the perceived direction of rotation of the two-dimensional figure is unstable over time. Stability can be temporarily induced by adaptation to a three-dimensional globe with a direction of rotation unambiguously specified by stereo disparity; adaptation causes the two-dimensional figure to appear to rotate in the direction opposite that experienced during stereoscopic adaptation. This adaptation effect is selective for axis of rotation but is not shape-specific. It does depend on simultaneous stimulation by multiple depth planes defined by elements moving in different directions. Evidently information about stereopsis and information about structure from motion are integrated within a common neural site in the brain."

https://openalex.org/W1523366628,"An autosomal recessive mutation, termed fatty liver dystrophy (fld), can be identified in neonatal mice by their enlarged and fatty liver (Sweet, H. O., Birkenmeier, E. H., and Davisson, M. T. (1988) Mouse News Letter 81, 69). We have examined the underlying metabolic abnormalities in fld/fld mice from postnatal days 3-40. Serum and hepatic triglyceride levels were elevated 5-fold in suckling fld/fld mice compared to their +/? littermates but abruptly resolved at the suckling/weaning transition. Blot hybridization analysis of liver and intestinal RNAs revealed a liver-specific increase in apolipoprotein (apo) A-IV and C-II mRNA concentrations (100- and 6-fold, respectively) that was limited to the suckling and early weaning stages in fld/fld mice. Resolution of these differences during the weaning period could not be delayed by prolonging suckling to the 20th postnatal day nor could the mutant phenotype be elicited in young adult animals with a high fat diet. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was reduced 16-fold in the white adipose tissue of fld/fld mice until the onset of weaning. Heart activity was decreased less than 2-fold, but there were no deficits in brown adipose tissue or liver. Hepatic lipase (HL) mRNA levels and activity were significantly reduced in fld/fld livers and sera, respectively, during the suckling period. Mapping studies show the fld locus to be distinct from loci encoding LPL, HL, and apoA-IV, and those responsible for the combined lipase deficiencies in cld/cld and W/Wv mice. These data suggest that the fld mutation is associated with developmentally programmed tissue-specific defects in the neonatal expression of LPL and HL activities and provide evidence for a new regulatory locus which affects these lipase activities. This mutation could serve as a useful model for (i) analyzing the homeostatic mechanisms controlling lipid metabolism in newborn mice and (ii) understanding and treating certain inborn errors in human triglyceride metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2013252641,"The functional architecture of synaptic circuits is determined to a crucial degree by the patterns of electrical activity that occur during development. Studies with an in vitro preparation of mammalian sensory neurons projecting to ventral spinal cord neurons show that electrical activity induces competitive processes that regulate synaptic efficacy so as to favor activated pathways over inactive convergent pathways. At the same time, electrical activity initiates noncompetitive processes that increase the number of axonal connections between these sensory and spinal cord neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2032870194,"Although electrical coupling between rods and cones in the retina has been assumed to be static, it has now been shown that rod-cone coupling can be strengthened by light. Increment threshold measurements reveal that cone input to rods increases progressively as background light becomes brighter. Current injection into cones produces larger responses in adjacent rods in the presence of background light than in darkness. Weak coupling under dark-adapted conditions facilitates synaptic transmission of small rod signals, and strong coupling under light-adapted conditions enhances transmission of large cone signals."
https://openalex.org/W2040302336,"Termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II has been shown in several cases to require a functional poly(A) addition site, although the actual termination event occurs further downstream. To define in more detail the sequences required for termination, we mapped the site at which transcription terminates on a chimeric plasmid template that contains the adenovirus MLP directing transcription of the SV40 early region. Termination in cells transfected with this plasmid occurs within a discrete promoter-proximal region that contains an inverted CCAAT-box sequence. This region of the MLP was also capable of directing termination, in an orientation-dependent manner, when inserted downstream of the poly(A) site in the plasmid template. In addition, in adenovirus-infected cells, transcription initiated from upstream promoters on the adenovirus chromosome terminates within the same MLP promoter-proximal region, both establishing the physiological relevance of the observed CCAAT-box dependent termination, and also suggesting a possible function for transcription termination in adenovirus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2000174554,"The DNA-dependent RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 utilizes a specific RNA as a template and replicates it efficiently and accurately. The RNA product (X RNA), approximately 70 nucleotides long, is initiated with either pppC or pppG and contains an AU-tich sequence. Replication of X RNA involves synthesis of complementary strands. Both strands are also significantly self-complementary, producing RNA with an extensive hairpin secondary structure. Replication of X RNA by T7 RNA polymerase is both template and enzyme specific. No other RNA serves as template for replication; neither do other polymerases, including the closely related T3 RNA polymerase, replicate X RNA. The T7 RNA polymerase-X RNA system provides an interesting model for studying replication of RNA by DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Such a mechanism has been proposed to propagate viroids and hepatitis delta, pathogenic RNAs whose replication seems to depend on cellular RNA polymerases."
https://openalex.org/W2435566390,"Cooperative binding of myosin S-1.ADP to regulated F-actin was previously reported and has been interpreted by a two-state model in which an important source of cooperativity is nearest neighbor interactions between the 7-actin.tropomyosin (TM).troponin units (functional units) (Hill, T.L., Eisenberg, E., and Greene, L. (1980) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 77, 3186-3190). It has been postulated that the head-to-tail overlap between adjacent TM molecules is the structural basis of the nearest neighbor interactions. We tested the hypothesis by examining S-1.ADP binding to reconstituted regulated F-actin containing either intact TM or nonpolymerizable TM from which the COOH-terminal 11 residues were removed. In the absence of Ca2+, substitution of nonpolymerizable TM for TM reduced significantly the slope of the steeply rising phase of the sigmoidal S-1.ADP binding curve. Nevertheless, considerable residual cooperativity remained. Analysis of the data using the two-state model of Hill et al. suggests that removal of TM overlap abolishes nearest neighbor interactions, while the concerted change of the state of 7 actins in a functional unit can account for the residual cooperativity."
https://openalex.org/W2068088197,"A system for the analysis of independent T-DNA transfer events from Agrobacterium to plants is described. The complete T-DNA except for the 25 bp border sequences was replaced by one genome of a plant virus so that upon transfer to the plant, a viable replicon is produced by circularization. Rescue of virus from such infected plants allowed analysis of DNA sequences at or close to the ends of T-DNA molecules. A rather conserved right border remnant of three nucleotides was found, whereas the sequences remaining at the left end were more variable. A point deletion in the left 25 bp sequence results in even less precise processing at the left end. In addition, many rescued T-DNA molecules carry small direct repeats between the joined T-DNA ends; linear T-DNA molecules are therefore transported to the plant."

The drug conjugate was nearly 100 times as effective as free methotrexate in eliminating the intracellular parasites. Furthermore, in a model of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis in hamsters, the drug conjugate brought about more than 90% reduction in the size of footpad lesions within 11 days. In contrast, the free drug at a similar concentration did not significantly affect lesion size.

https://openalex.org/W2103745185,"In the present studies we examined the distribution, release, and biological actions of peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) in the rat. The concentration and distribution of PYY was highest in the ileum and colon as determined by both radioimmunoassay of rat tissue extracts and immunocytochemistry. An ultrastructural comparison of rat and dog colonic PYY cells revealed a bipolar distribution of peptide-containing secretory granules in both species. Serum PYY and pancreatic exocrine secretory responses were monitored after presentation of a meal to meal-trained rats (n = 12). A significant increase in PYY concentrations was not observed until 120 min after meal presentation, a delayed response similar to that previously observed in the dog. PYY responses were also observed in rats after perfusion of the intestine at the level of the duodenum and ileum with an 80 mOsm micellar solution of sodium oleate. Duodenal instillations of the fatty acids resulted in a maximum PYY response after 120 min, whereas rats subject to ileal perfusion of fat exhibited maximum PYY release within the first hour. In other experiments, infusion of exogenous PYY at 100 pmol · kg−1 · h−1, which reproduced plasma PYY levels observed after a meal and perfusion of the gut with fat, significantly inhibited CCK-stimulated bile pancreatic volume (P < 0.02), protein (P < 0.01), and amylase (P < 0.01) output. These studies demonstrate a bipolar distribution of PYY-containing secretory granules in cells of the jejunal, ileal, and colonic mucosa, and show that PYY is released in response to a meal in amounts sufficient to inhibit cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic secretion. Evidence is presented that PYY may mediate the delayed inhibition of pancreatic secretion that is observed in the rat after ingestion of a meal.—Aponte, G.

https://openalex.org/W1556885373,"Abstract We have identified and characterized multiple forms of biliverdin reductase (BVR) in control rat liver cytosol. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of the purified BVR resolved a minimum of 10 discrete protein zones. All 10 proteins were BVR as judged by immunological cross-reactivity toward rabbit anti-rat BVR. Based on the isoelectric focusing pattern of separation, the BVR variants could be organized into five net-charge groups designated as BVR-IEF1 to BVR-IEF5 and three molecular mass groups designated as BVR-MW1-BVR-MW3, respectively. The pI values of the net-charge groups were: BVR-IEF1, 6.23; IEF2, 5.91; IEF3, 5.76; IEF4, 5.61; IEF5, 5.48. The Mr values of the molecular mass groups were: BVR-MW1, 30,400; MW2, 30,700; MW3, 31,400. Single dimension slab gel isoelectric focusing offered greater resolution of the net charge variants, and BVR-IEF3 was further resolved into two variants, IEF3a and IEF3b, with pIs of 5.77 and 5.75, respectively. The six net-charge variants also resolved on a preparative chromatofocusing column and were designated as BVR-CF1-BVR-CF6. The pH values of the peak fractions were: BVR-CF1, 6.91; CF2, 6.33; CF3, 6.03; CF4, 5.82; CF5, 5.45; CF6, 5.27. Correspondence between the isoelectric focusing net-charge variants and the chromatofocusing net-charge variants was established. The Mr and net-charge variants did not represent partially degraded forms of biliverdin reductase produced during purification since the pattern of resolution of variants on slab gel isoelectric focusing or two-dimensional electrophoresis did not change by purifying the proteins in the presence of protease inhibitors and 5 mM EDTA. BVR-CF2 and BVR-CF4 were purified and examined for pH-dependent cofactor requirements for activity. Both net-charge variants and two pH optima that were cofactor-dependent; maximum activity with NADPH, however, was at pH 8.5 and with NADH at pH 6.7. With both variants, however, a higher catalytic rate was observed with NADH than with NADPH at their respective pH optima. Furthermore, BVR-CF2 exhibited a higher catalytic rate than did BVR-CF4 with either cofactor throughout the pH range of 5-9."
https://openalex.org/W1558643823,"Three distinct states of the formyl peptide receptor have been described. These are: 1) the ternary complex of ligand, receptor, and G protein (LRG); 2) the rapidly dissociating occupied receptor (ligand-receptor complex (LR]; and 3) a desensitized slowly dissociating guanine nucleotide-insensitive receptor (desensitized ligand-receptor complex (LRX]. During cell activation there is a rapid interconversion among receptor states from a rapidly dissociating form (t 1/2 approximately 10 s) to a slowly dissociating form (t 1/2 greater than or equal to 2 min). Neither the dynamics of the states nor their interconversion is influenced by ribosylation of G protein in the presence of pertussis toxin. In contrast to ribosylation, treatment of cells with either 2-deoxyglucose or fluoride ion, both of which lead to a loss of adenine and guanine nucleotides, causes a time-dependent change in ligand dissociability. After short periods of treatment (5-15 min) rapid dissociation is observed; after longer times (30-60 min), slow dissociation is once again detected. When intact cells are first ribosylated and then energy-depleted, only a rapidly dissociating receptor is detected. These results are discussed in terms of a model with the following elements: 1) intact cell dynamics during cell activation are dominated by an energy-dependent interconversion from LR to LRX; 2) under activation conditions, LRG appears and disappears too rapidly to be detected; 3) in cells depleted of energy and guanine nucleotide, LRG is stabilized; 4) in cells both ribosylated and depleted of energy, LR is stabilized."

https://openalex.org/W1547081765,"The third component of human complement (C3), a central molecule in both the classical and alternative pathways of complement, is comprised of two polypeptides, termed the alpha and beta chains. Activation of C3 cleaves the alpha chain into two fragments, C3a, an inflammatory peptide, and the alpha' chain which remains covalently linked to the beta chain. Proteolytic fragments derived from the alpha' chain during activation and regulation of complement play a significant role in host defense and regulation of the immune response. Two cosmid clones covering the alpha' chain region were used to characterize the structure of this portion of the C3 gene. The alpha' chain is encoded by 24 exons, which range in size from 52 to 213 base pairs (bp) with an average size of 115 bp. The splice donor sequence at the beginning of intron 12 has a rare sequence variant of GC instead of the usual GT sequence. Ten introns have been completely sequenced and were surprisingly short, ranging in size from 85 to 242 bp with an average of 140 bp. Other introns range in size from 250 bp to over 4 kilobases in length. The gene size for this portion of C3 is estimated to be 23-24 kilobases. Comparison of exon structure with protein domains and with peptide mapping studies demonstrates that several binding sites on C3 are encoded by single exons. These data support the hypothesis that individual exons can code for functional protein domains."
https://openalex.org/W1561304603,"Abstract The successive methylations of phosphatidylethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine were measured using exogenously added intermediates and membrane preparations from human red blood cells. The addition of phosphatidylethanolamine resulted in no increase in methylation rate over that with endogenous substrate; however, the addition of monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine (PME) and dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (PDE) markedly increased the reaction rate and allowed studies into the kinetic mechanism for the second and third methylation reactions. The data are consistent with catalysis of the last two methylations being by a single enzyme with a random Bi-Bi sequential mechanism. Analysis of PDE:phosphatidylcholine product ratios indicates that the enzyme can conduct multiple methylations of enzyme-bound phospholipid. The nature of the acyl chain (16:0 versus 18:1) of the phospholipid had only a small effect on the value of the kinetic constants. The maximal velocities obtained with the 18:1 substrate were less than 5% lower than those obtained with the 16:0 substrate. The Km values for the two phospholipids were 20-45 and 10-14 microM for the methylation of PME and PDE, respectively. The Km for S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) was 5-9 microM with PME and 4 microM with PDE as substrates. Depending on the acyl chain and the phospholipid, the Ki(AdoMet) varied from 8 to 19 microM, the Ki(PME) from 41 to 82 microM, and the Ki(PDE) from 35 to 61 microM. The Ki for S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) was between 1.0 and 1.4 microM depending upon the variable substrate. The endogenous concentrations of PME and PDE in red blood cell membranes were estimated to be 0.49 and 0.24 mumol/liter packed cells, respectively. The product from the utilization of AdoMet, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of its precursor, AdoMet, and a noncompetitive inhibitor of the two phospholipid substrates."

Mitochondrial translation products were pulse-labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine using isolated rat heart mitochondria in the presence of an energy-generating system. The relative rate of protein degradation was estimated from the specific activity (counts/min/mg of protein) of the labeled translation products following the addition of unlabeled methionine (chase). To modulate membrane potential, inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation were used singly or in combination; their effect was monitored by following uptake of the nonmetabolizable lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium. When the potential was dissipated, the rate of polypeptide decay increased and vice versa. These results suggest that the stability of mitochondrial translation products is linked to a process(es) that is dependent upon delta psi; likely candidates include synthesis and/or assembly of mitochondrial gene products."
