https://openalex.org/W1798947166,"Despite major advances in our understanding of the structure of mycobacterial cell walls, little is known of their biogenesis, and yet they are the site of action of many anti-tuberculosis drugs and implicated in much of the pathology of tuberculosis and leprosy. A family of monoglycosyl polyprenylphosphates was isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis, containing arabinose, ribose, and mannose. The isoprenoid nature of the lipid components was established by 1H NMR, and fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-MS) demonstrated the presence of C50 decaprenyl-P derivatives and smaller amounts of the C35 octahydroheptaprenyl-P products. The configuration of the mycobacterial decaprenol was established as mono-trans, octa-cis, pointing to carriers of unusual structure. Combined gas chromatography (GC)/MS, FAB-MS/MS, and 1H NMR allowed characterization of one of the primary components as beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-1-monophosphodecaprenol. Pulse-chase metabolic labeling of cells with D-[14C]glucose indicated that the decaprenyl-P-arabinose is an active intermediate in the biosynthesis of the arabinan of cell wall arabinogalactan and arabinomannan. The identification of polyprenyl-P-ribose suggests the existence of ribose-containing polysaccharides in the cell walls of M. smegmatis or/and of a novel epimerase in the D-arabinose biosynthetic pathway. Ethambutol, a powerful anti-tuberculosis drug known to inhibit arabinogalactan and arabinomannan biosynthesis, results in the rapid accumulation of decaprenyl-P-arabinose, indicating that the drug interferes with either the transfer of arabinose from the donor or, alternatively, the synthesis of the arabinose acceptor itself."
https://openalex.org/W1540403899,"The activation of prothrombin, factor V, factor VIII, factor IX, and factor X by the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, in vitro, in a system in which each precursor protein was present at plasma concentration, was evaluated using a combination of activity assays, immunoblots, active-site blots, and autoradiography. The thrombin generation curves observed were distinctly nonlinear and typically displayed a time lag in which little or no thrombin was observed. This was followed by an almost linear propagation phase of thrombin formation. The lag was a function of tissue factor/factor VIIa concentration and represented primarily the interval of factor V and factor VIII activation. The postlag propagation phase of thrombin generation was nearly independent of the initial activator (factor VIIa or tissue factor) concentration over a 10(3)-fold range in factor VIIa-tissue factor concentration. Maximum thrombin generation rates were observed when less than 1% of the factor IX and X present was activated but when nearly 100% activation of the cofactors, factor V and factor VIII, was achieved. Analyses of the activation pattern of factor V indicated that the cofactor is activated by both factor Xa and thrombin which are formed at low levels during the lag phase of the reaction. When the initial reaction mixture contained factor Va instead of factor V, the lag was substantially reduced. When factor V was deleted from the reaction mixture, no thrombin formation was observed. When either factor VII or factor IX was deleted from the reaction system, the propagation phase of thrombin formation (at 5 pM tissue factor-factor VIIa complex) was only one-third that observed for reactions which contained factor VIII and factor IX. The addition of factor XI to the experimental system increased the rate of thrombin formation by 15% during the propagation phase but had no effect upon the lag phase of the reaction. Our data suggest that normal hemostasis may be initiated by the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex and support the concept of multiple feedback reactions which amplify and propagate the hemostatic response."
https://openalex.org/W1479791469,"The high affinity human interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor complex consists of IL-6 and two membrane-associated receptor components, the IL-6 receptor (alpha-subunit) and the high affinity converter and signal transducing molecule, gp-130 (beta-subunit). Recombinant IL-6 and the extracellular (soluble) components of the IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and gp-130 (sgp-130) have been prepared in order to investigate the stoichiometry and binding of these components in the low affinity (IL-6.sIL-6R) and high affinity (IL-6.sIL-6R.sgp-130) IL-6 receptor complexes. Using a combination of size-exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation analysis, in the low affinity receptor complex, IL-6 was shown to bind sIL-6R in a stoichiometric ratio of 1:1, whereas the high affinity ternary complex is hexameric consisting of two molecules each of IL-6, sIL-6R, and sgp-130. This is the first direct demonstration of a higher order arrangement for receptor cytokine interactions that exhibit both high and low affinity complexes."
https://openalex.org/W1527704744,"A 39-kDa receptor associated protein (RAP) binds and inhibits ligand binding by two members of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family, gp330 and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. To determine if additional members of the LDL receptor family may interact with RAP, Chinese hamster ovary cells were transfected with plasmids directing expression of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor cDNA or the LDL receptor cDNA. Detergent-soluble extracts from these and normal Chinese hamster ovary cells were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after which the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and incubated with RAP. When detergent extracts from normal cells were incubated with RAP, several polypeptides, including a 130-kDa protein, were observed to bind RAP. In cells transfected with the VLDL receptor cDNA, a substantial increase in RAP binding to the 130-kDa polypeptide was noted. This protein was identified as the VLDL receptor by immunoblotting. The VLDL receptor present in detergent extracts from transfected cells bound to RAP-Sepharose, and a KD of 0.7 nM for the interaction between RAP and the purified VLDL receptor was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The purified VLDL receptor bound 125I-labeled VLDL, but not 125I-labeled LDL, and the binding of 125I-labeled VLDL was completely inhibited by RAP. Further, RAP inhibited the uptake and degradation of 125I-VLDL by cells overexpressing the VLDL receptor. Thus the VLDL receptor represents the third member of the LDL receptor family whose ligand binding properties are antagonized by RAP. This suggests a common functional role for RAP in modulating ligand binding by members of the LDL receptor family."

https://openalex.org/W1511802802,"A mathematical simulation of the tissue factor pathway to the generation of thrombin has been developed using a combination of empirical, estimated, and deduced rate constants for reactions involving the activation of factor IX, X, V, and VIII, in the formation of thrombin, as well as rate constants for the assembly of the coagulation enzyme complexes which involve factor VIIIa-factor IXa (intrinsic tenase) and factor Va-Xa (prothrombinase) assembled on phospholipid membrane. Differential equations describing the fate of each species in the reaction were developed and solved using an interactive procedure based upon the Runge-Kutta technique. In addition to the theoretical considerations involving the reactions of the tissue factor pathway, a physical constraint associated with the stability of the factor VIIIa-factor IXa complex has been incorporated into the model based upon the empirical observations associated with the stability of this complex. The model system provides a realistic accounting of the fates of each of the proteins in the coagulation reaction through a range of initiator (factor VIIa-tissue factor) concentrations ranging from 5 pM to 5 nM. The model is responsive to alterations in the concentrations of factor VIII, factor V, and their respective activated species, factor VIIIa and factor Va, and overall provides a reasonable approximation of empirical data. The computer model permits the assessment of the reaction over a broad range of conditions and provides a useful tool for the development and management of reaction studies."
https://openalex.org/W1509650469,"The Ca(2+)-sensitive cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) displays both a phospholipase A2 and a lysophospholipase activity. Numerous hydrolases, including lipases, catalyze the hydrolysis of ester bonds by means of an active site triad of amino acids that includes a serine or a cysteine residue. We have examined whether human cPLA2 belongs to this class of enzymes by using site-directed mutagenesis. Although chemical inactivation of cPLA2 by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide made it appear that cysteine(s) may be essential for catalysis, all 9 cysteine residues of cPLA2 proved dispensable, allowing near-normal enzyme activity when substituted by alanine. We noted that cPLA2 contains a 110-amino-acid region with sequence homology to phospholipase B (PLB) from Penicillium notatum. Interestingly, one of the conserved serines of cPLA2, Ser-228, within this domain aligns with the lipase consensus sequence Gly-X(Leu)-Ser(137)-X(Gly)-Gly of PLB. Replacement of Ser-228 by alanine (or threonine or cysteine) yielded catalytically inactive cPLA2, even though the native conformation was maintained as determined by CD spectroscopy. Likewise, the lysophospholipase activity was completely abolished by the Ser-228 mutations. In contrast, substitution by alanine of three different serines of cPLA2 (Ser-195, Ser-215, or Ser-577) that also aligned with the PLB sequence allowed for substantial enzymatic activity of cPLA2. Our findings provide evidence that 1) Ser-228 participates in the catalytic mechanism of cPLA2 and that 2) both the phospholipase A2 and the lysophospholipase activities of cPLA2 are catalyzed by the same active site residue(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1586074842,"We have cloned a second class of inward rectifier potassium channels, designated MB-IRK2, from a mouse brain cDNA library. The amino acid sequence of this clone shares 70% identity with the mouse IRK1. Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA derived from MB-IRK2 expressed a K+ current, which showed inward rectifying channel characteristics similar to the MB-IRK1 current. In contrast to the MB-IRK1 current, however, the MB-IRK2 current exhibited significant inactivation during hyperpolarizing pulses. In patch clamp experiments with 140 mM K+ in the pipette, the single channel conductance of MB-IRK2 was 34.2 +/- 2.1 picosiemens (n = 5), a value significantly larger than that of MB-IRK1 (22.2 +/- 3.0 picosiemens, n = 5). Consistent with the whole cell current, the steady-state open probability (Po) of the MB-IRK2 channel decreased with hyperpolarization, whereas that of the MB-IRK1 remained constant. Northern blot analysis revealed the mRNA for MB-IRK2 to be expressed in forebrain, cerebellum, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle. In the brain, the abundance of mRNA for MB-IRK2 was much higher in cerebellum than in forebrain and vice versa in the case of MB-IRK1. These results demonstrate that the IRK family is composed of multiple genes, which may play heterogenous functional roles in various organs, including the central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1534636938,"Macrocyclic natural products derived from bromotyrosine isolated from the sponge Ianthella basta are shown to selectively modulate the skeletal isoform of the ryanodine-sensitive sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium channel by a novel mechanism involving the FKBP12/RyR-1 complex. Bastadins 5, 7, and the newly identified isomer of bastadin 5, bastadin 19, show marked differences in potency and efficacy toward activation of the binding of [3H]ryanodine. In physiological salt, bastadin 5 (5 microM) increases the [3H]ryanodine binding capacity of SR membranes 5-fold, by stabilizing the high affinity conformation of RyR-1 for ryanodine without shifting the affinity of the activator site for Ca2+ or altering the response to caffeine or adenine nucleotides. Bastadin 5 decreases the inhibitory potency of Mg2+ 8-fold and high (> 100 microM) Ca2+ 5-fold. Bastadin 5 inhibits Ca2+ uptake into SR vesicles and enhances Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release 8-fold. Bastadin 5 increases single-channel open dwell time, tau 1 and tau 2, 65- and 92-fold, respectively, without changing unitary conductance for Cs+ (450 picosiemans) or open probability. Most significant is the finding that the unique actions of bastadin 5 on [3H]ryanodine binding and Ca2+ transport are antagonized by the immunosuppressant FK506. FK506 alone weakly enhances the binding of [3H]ryanodine, compared to bastadin 5. However, FK506 diminishes bastadin 5-induced changes in [3H]ryanodine binding and Ca2+ transport without altering the efficacy of adenine nucleotides. Unlike FK506, bastadin 5 does not directly promote the dissociation of FKBP12 from the RyR-1 membrane complex; however, it markedly enhances the release of FKBP12 induced by FK506. These results suggest that the bastadin 5 effector site is a novel modulatory domain on FKBP12. Bastadins represent a new class of compounds to gain insight into the functional interactions between FKBP12 and RyR-1."
https://openalex.org/W1572585912,"We have compared the periodic fluctuation of mRNAs encoded by CDC6, a cell cycle gene controlling initiation of DNA replication, and CLN1, a G1 cyclin gene expressed at late G1. The maxima of CDC6 mRNA precede those of CLN1 mRNA by about 15 min in cells synchronized by release from pheromone arrest or from a cdc15 thermal arrest. CDC6 mRNA accumulates in cdc15-arrested telophase cells, decays around cell separation, and reappears during telophase and nuclear division of the next cycle. CDC6 transcription at late mitosis is not affected by the pheromone signaling pathway. The CDC6 mRNA fluctuation pattern is imposed to a CLN1-derived reporter gene if fused to the CDC6 promoter. The CDC6 gene was expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein and purified by affinity chromatography. The Cdc6 protein binds rATP and rGTP upon UV cross-linking and catalyzes the DNA-independent hydrolysis of purine nucleoside triphosphates, but does not appear to interact directly with DNA. The Cdc6 protein may control the ATP-dependent initiation of replication by conferring ATPase activity to an origin-recognizing complex."
https://openalex.org/W1567820531,"Osteopontin (OPN), a secreted phosphoprotein, has been implicated in various biological phenomena (e.g. bone development, sepsis, tumor progression, and metastasis). Its role in any context is poorly understood. OPN contains a conserved Gly-Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (GRGDS) sequence, and binds to cells via integrin-mediated mechanisms. Using recombinant human osteopontin-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and our improved hybridoma fusion partner (Sp2/mIL6), we raised murine monoclonal antibodies against osteopontin. We characterized two antibodies that recognize not only recombinant but also native human osteopontin. These antibodies do not cross-react with mouse osteopontin (recombinant protein or that secreted by ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells), or bovine bone osteopontin, suggesting that they recognize epitopes unique to human OPN. One antibody specifically inhibited adhesion of MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells and ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells to human osteopontin. This antibody failed to recognize osteopontin cleaved by thrombin, which cleaves adjacent to the cell binding domain. We previously showed that thrombin cleavage reduces osteopontin cell binding activity. Thus we postulate that this monoclonal antibody recognizes and interferes with the function of the RGD/thrombin cleavage region of human OPN."

https://openalex.org/W1576943396,"The vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) of plant cells is subject to substrate (Mg2PPi)-protectable, free PPi-potentiated irreversible inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagent N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). Inhibition by NEM approximates pseudo-first order kinetics and double-log plots of the first order rate constant for inactivation versus NEM concentration yield a straight line relationship with a slope of approximately unity. Since NEM and the membrane-impermeant cysteine reagent 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (MPB) inhibit the V-PPase with similar kinetics and compete for a common binding site on the M(r) = 66,000 substrate-binding subunit, a single residue located in a cytosolically disposed extramembranous domain is inferred to undergo covalent modification in both cases. Selective labeling of the V-PPase of vacuolar membrane vesicles with [14C]NEM, purification of the M(r) = 66,000 subunit, and its digestion with V8 protease generates multiple peptide fragments. Of the bands identified after electrophoresis of the digests on Tris-Tricine gels, only one, migrating at M(r) = 14,000 (V814K), contains 14C label. Gas-phase sequence analysis of this band after electrotransfer to Immobilon PSQ yields two overlapping sequences (V814K2 and V814K2) which unambiguously align with the carboxyl-terminal segment of the M(r) = 66,000 subunit. Both V814K1 and V814K2 encompass only 1 cysteine residue at position 634 which is conserved between the V-PPases from Arabidopsis thaliana, Beta vulgaris (isoforms 1 and 2), and Hordeum vulgare. On the basis of these findings, the strict conservation of the sequence of the V-PPase from multiple plant sources, and the identical kinetics of interaction of the enzymes from Vigna and Beta with NEM and MPB, Cys634 of putative hydrophilic loop X is concluded to be the cytosolically oriented residue whose alkylation by maleimides is responsible for inactivation of the V-PPase. The significance of these results with respect to earlier speculations concerning the identity of the catalytic site and topology of the V-PPase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1600233405,"We report the characterization of a mutation affecting tau 138, the largest subunit of yeast transcription factor IIIC (TFIIIC). A previously described thermosensitive mutation (tsv115), tightly linked to the centromere of chromosome I (Harris, S.D., and Pringle, J.R. (1991) Genetics 127, 279-285) is shown to lie in the TFC3 gene which encodes tau 138. The tau 138 subunit carrying this mutation bears a single substitution of Glu for Gly at position 349 (G349E). In extracts from mutant cells, both the level of TFIIIC and its affinity for tDNA were found to be reduced. The tDNA binding activity of mutant TFIIIC protein was very sensitive to mild heat treatments, and TFIIIC-DNA interaction was inhibited at moderate salt concentrations, as evidenced by gel shift assays. In addition, the tsv115 mutation affected 5 S RNA synthesis in vitro, suggesting that the tau 138 subunit also plays a role in recognition of the TFIIIA-5 S DNA complex. Multicopy suppressors of the TFIIIC defect were sought to reveal components participating in TFIIIC function. One class of suppressors encodes known components of the transcription machinery: two TFIIIC subunits, tau 95 and tau 131, the 70-kDa subunit of TFIIIB, TBP, and a shared subunit of RNA polymerase (pol) I, II, and III, ABC10 alpha; it also includes genes potentially related to pol III function, such as SRP40 which also suppresses a mutation in a subunit shared by RNA polymerases I and III. A second class of suppressors is not involved in transcription but alleviates the main physiological defects of mutant cells. It includes RPR1 and NOP1, required for the maturation of pre-tRNA and pre-rRNA, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W1490014896,"A specific inhibitor of fertilization of the sea urchin Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus was isolated from the extract of the marine sponge, Jaspis species. Chemical and spectral data of the purified substance, which was designated jaspisin, showed that it is a novel substance with the structure of sodium (E)-5,6-dihydroxystyryl sulfate. Jaspisin at 15 micrograms/ml inhibited exoplasmic fusion of the plasma membrane of acrosome-reacted sperm with the plasma membrane of the egg; it did not affect either the acrosome reaction in sperm or the egg cortical reaction, both of which involve endoplasmic membrane fusion events. When a fertilized egg was cultured in jaspisin, the embryo developed through the mesenchymal blastula stage. However, it was unable to hatch from the fertilization envelope, and spiculogenesis, in which cell-cell fusion of primary mesenchyme cells is involved, was prevented. Jaspisin at 8.6 micrograms/ml inhibited half the activity of hatching enzyme, a kind of Zn(2+)-dependent metalloendoproteinases. Because Zn(2+)-activated metalloendoproteinases are suggested to be involved in both sperm-egg fusion and fusion of primary mesenchyme cells (Lennarz, W.J., and Strittmatter, W.J. (1991) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1071, 149-158), one of the possible explanations of the jaspisin effects is that the sulfate inhibits these cellular events through blockage of Zn(2+)-activated metalloendoproteinases that are involved in membrane fusion processes."
https://openalex.org/W92144819,"The two active-site tryptophans of diphtheria toxin, Trp-50 and Trp-153, were individually or jointly replaced with phenylalanine or alanine by directed mutagenesis of a synthetic gene for the toxin's catalytic A fragment. Substitution of Trp-50 with alanine (W50A) decreased the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity by nearly 10(5)-fold and reduced NAD-glycohydrolase activity beyond the limits of our detection. Effects of the W153A mutation on these activities were less dramatic, < 40-fold decrease in ADP-ribosylation and < 10-fold decrease in NAD glycohydrolysis. The W50F and W153F substitutions caused only minimal reductions (< 2-fold) in enzyme activities and NAD affinity. Decreases in affinity for NAD in the initial, ground state complex, as measured by intrinsic protein fluorescence, correlated well with the reductions in enzyme activity. None of the mutations caused greater than a 10-fold decrease in NAD affinity for the ternary Michaelis complex in the ADP-ribosylation reaction; and none caused significant increase in susceptibility to proteolytic digestion by trypsin. The results indicate that Trp-50 is a major determinant of NAD affinity. Also, they identify this residue as a candidate for modification in the development of inactive forms of the toxin for use in vaccine development."

TCF activities were partially purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts by DNA-cellulose and anion-exchange chromatography followed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Four different protein spots (p60TCF, p62TCF, p62.5TCF, and p64TCF) show renaturable TCF activity. One, p62TCF, was indistinguishable from the Ets protein Elk-1 in gel shift analyses, while none of the HeLa TCFs resembled the other cloned TCFs, SAP-1a and SAP-1b. In two-dimensional gel analysis, Elk-1, SAP-1a, and SAP-1b displayed different pI and M(r) values and in vitro synthesized Elk-1 comigrated with the p62TCF spot. Both reacted with Elk-1 specific antisera, as did the major proportion of TCF activity present in HeLa crude extracts. We conclude that p62TCF is composed of Elk-1, whereas the identities of the other identified TCFs (p60TCF, p62.5TCF, and p64TCF) are still unknown."
