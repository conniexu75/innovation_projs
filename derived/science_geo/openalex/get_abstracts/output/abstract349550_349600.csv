https://openalex.org/W2023045244,"THE effect on spermatozoa of vitrification at temperatures of –79° C. and below has been studied by several authors. Human spermatozoa appear to be the most resistant ; a substantial proportion may show good motility on thawing after even prolonged vitrification. Revival is far better when semen is frozen in bulk than when minimal amounts in capillary tubes are used1. No explanation of this result is yet forthcoming, but it would appear that rapidity of freezing is less important than the avoidance of surface effects."

https://openalex.org/W1985195823,"WITH increasing use of chromatographic columns, the need has arisen for automatic fraction-cutting apparatus. Stein and Stanford Moore1 have devised such an apparatus in which the fraction is measured photo-electrically and the battery of receivers then moved on by an electric motor. Randall and Martin2 have recently described an ingenious mechanical fraction-cutter in which an intermittent siphon cuts the fractions. The weight of the fraction operates an escapement, bringing the siphon opposite the next receiver, the rack of receivers being stationary. In the apparatus described here, the receiver, which is depressed by the weight of the fraction, acts as the escapement. Randall and Martin used the torque of a twisted string to move the siphon delivery tube, and this idea has been copied here to move the whole rack of tubes."

https://openalex.org/W2088165562,"DURING the years 1938 and 1939 fixed-frequency pulse observations were being used to record continuously the virtual height and echo intensity of reflexions from the F-region at two frequencies close to the vertical penetration frequency for the region. It was noticed that, in the daytime, the penetration frequency often showed quasi-periodic fluctuations with periods of the order of half an hour. The magnitude of the fluctuation was variable but frequently of the order of 1 Mc./s. from maximum to minimum."

https://openalex.org/W2071753047,"THE following method of recording continuously a sensory threshold or other psycho-physical variable may, it is thought, be capable of a wide variety of applications to psycho-physiological problems. The intensity of a stimulus is made to increase automatically at a constant rate from a point below the threshold value. When the subject perceives the stimulus, he presses a button, and keeps it depressed for so long as the stimulus is perceptible. The depression of the button is made to reverse the stimulus-control mechanism so that the intensity now decreases automatically at the same constant rate as it before increased. When the subject no longer perceives the stimulus he releases the button, the stimulus control is again reversed, and the cycle of events repeats itself. The system is thus a cyclic one with intermittent control exercised by the human operator, and the stimulus control hunts about the threshold value."

This is inhibited by the addition of small doses of desoxycorticosterone1. If the muscle works in response to rhythmic stimulation for two hours, glycogen is newly formed and is broken down again. This is also inhibited by desoxycorticosterone2. The action of other steroid hormones was also studied. They had either equal effect (progesterone, testosterone) or none (corticosterone, etc.)3."

https://openalex.org/W2040622060,"ACCORDING to a note in Physical Abstracts1, R. L. Mullokandov2 finds that thermal conductivity of powders is practically due only to the convection in the surrounding gas, and that hence ""a layer of smooth spherical particles in vacuum may be used as a good thermal insulator"". This was discovered by M. Smoluchowski some forty years ago3. He investigated both theoretically and experimentally the thermal conductivity of powders, and concluded that filling the space between the walls of a Dewar vessel with a suitable powder would provide improved insulation by reducing the convective currents as well as the radiation and, moreover, would improve the vacuum by absorption. His application for a patent resulted in a long argument with the German Patent Office, whose examiners were reluctant to admit that any material agent could provide a better insulation than 'absolute' vacuum. At that time a large metallic Dewar vessel with its interstice filled with powdered active carbon was built at the Physical Institute of the University in Lwów, and showed the expected high insulating properties. As that work of Smoluchowski remained little known, I think that this information may be of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2022806113,"THE possibility of using cobalt-60 interstitially as a source of radiation for therapeutic purposes prompted preliminary investigation of its behaviour when implanted subcutaneously. It is known that cobalt when administered to animals in sufficient quantities produces evidences of systemic toxicity1–3. There are also reports of the development of sterile abscesses at the site of injection of inactive cobaltous chloride4. It was anticipated, therefore, that metallic cobalt might produce a tissue reaction which would make its use as a bare needle or seed inadmissible. Another possibility was that particles of the metal might be absorbed by the animal and deposited or excreted in measurable amounts."

https://openalex.org/W2090330846,"DURING an investigation on the quantity of vitamin C in the broad bean, it was observed that the dry bean contained a high quantity of the vitamin. The figures obtained were between 9 mgm. and 11 mgm. of vitamin C per 100 gm. of fresh weight, and there was a rapid increase when the beans were soaked in water. The various parts of the bean were assayed for the vitamin and it was found that the cotyledons contained 3–4 mgm./100 gm. of fresh weight, and the amount rose to a maximum of 40–50 mgm. before falling off on the ninth day. At the same time the amount of the vitamin in the radicle rose from an average of 10·68 mgm./100 gm. of fresh weight on the first day to an average of 202·16 mgm. on the eighth day, and fell to an average of 11·87 mgm. on the twenty-fifth day, at which time the seedling was well established with plumule leaves and secondary roots. Care was taken to see that the separate radicles were of equal length when each batch was analysed ; the whole of the main root was used without the secondary roots when they appeared. When the radicles had emerged, the seedlings were placed in complete culture solutions contained in Winchester bottles, and the solutions were well aerated."

https://openalex.org/W2031898741,"IN spite of many attempts, it has not been possible so far to develop a theory of nuclear forces which accounts in a satisfactory way for all the properties of even the simplest system, a neutron and a proton. An alternative procedure might, therefore, be attempted, namely, to obtain the interaction potential empirically from the various observed properties like the binding energy, quadrupole moment, magnetic moment of the deuteron and the scattering cross-section. The latter seems particularly useful for this purpose, as there exist general reciprocal quantum mechanical relations between the differential scattering cross-section dσ and the interaction potential; dσ is expressed in terms of certain phase shifts ŋl, (l = 0, 1, 2, . . .), suffered by the partial waves of different orbital angular momentum l due to the interaction between the two particles. For spinless particles, a knowledge of d (as a function of the angle of scattering θ) determines all the phase shifts ŋl and vice versa, and a knowledge of the phase shift ŋl (as a function of energy) for a given l-state determines the interaction potential for that l-state and vice versa. However, the fact that the neutron–proton system splits into the singlet and triplet states (with different interactions) makes the determination of the phase-shifts from a knowledge of dσ (θ) alone impossible."

Of these a proportion have in the past turned to entomology, and it is to be hoped that they will continue to do so in the future. The proceedings of a recent conference held in London, the Second International Congress of Plant Protection, and a remark in the presidential address to the Society of Chemical Industry1 tend to support the view—much fostered by interested parties at the present time—that entomology in its applied aspects is no longer the province of the biologist, but is rapidly becoming, if it has not already become, that of the chemist and physicist. Sir David Rivett, in the address referred to, said, “When for example one approaches a problem of pest insect control, may it not well be that a physicist, aided by a mathematician and guided by a chemist, will prove of more value than any other worker?"

https://openalex.org/W4234302924,"ALTHOUGH, as Allsopp1 has recently indicated, radiation chemistry is in reality an old subject, it has received its major impetus during the Second World War. Problems of the production of atomic energy and atomic power require information on the effects of high-energy radiation on structural mater- Tals, coolants, moderators and chemicals and containers used in separation processes, as well as on the chemistry of nuclear recoils produced in the processes of radioactive decay or in processes for the separation of radioactive nuclides. Technological aspects of these problems have been handled primarily in the National Laboratories in the United States (Argonne, Oak Ridge and Brookhaven)and at the Chalk River Atomic Energy Establishment, Canada, and also at Harwell, England."

https://openalex.org/W4252760893,"DURING the Tourth annual conference of the Rationalist press Association, heald at Magdalen College, Oxford during August 5-9, the main theme for discussion was ""Science and Society"". In his presidential address, which opened the proceedings Prof. A. E. Health (University College, Swansea) dealt with scientific method, as applied to the social field. Referring to the opinion held in some quarters that as soon as we enter the domain of social and political affairs something other than normal scientific procedure is called for, he asserted that science is only common-sense reflexion more critically and more consistently applied, and that any field of human experience can become a science. What makes a study scientific is not the nature of the things it deals with but the way it deals with them. The first step in scientific method is the critical observation of any given body of facts, and the second is the setting out of these facts in some sort of scientific order ; then that order is tested and we are led to new facts which in turn have to be ordered, and so on in an endless series. In saying that reflexion upon facts becomes scientific by becoming more critical and systematic, we must not suppose that the change was an easy one ; it involved centuries of human struggle. Resistance to scientific treatment was particularly strong in human and social studies because we lack the courage to be critical in matters which come too closely home to our frail human nature. This perpetual struggle to put statements about our experience in testable form is not, however, the end of the story. In the less mature sciences there may still be alternative modes of ordering the facts. Social studies are still at the stage when there are many divergent possible modes of dealing with the same body of facts concerning human behaviour. To pass from J. B. Watson to Freud, or from Jung to Adler, is like moving into different worlds ; yet all these psychologists dealt with the same human facts, however different the terms they employed to interpret them and throw them into fruitful combinations. Our trouble in applying scientific method to the social sciences would be overcome if we could realize that novelty is a directly observable fact in the development of men and society. The theory of evolution is a critical step in our methods of thinking because it involves a recognition of novelty in science : if we are to master and direct our world, we must learn how to cope not only with the orderly but also with the novel aspects of the universe, even when that novelty is of our own making. Scientific method can be applied by taking into account the pliancy of life, thus achieving some measure of control out of the very heart of the unexpected and incalculable."
