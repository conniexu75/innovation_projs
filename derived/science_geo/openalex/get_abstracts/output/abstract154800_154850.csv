https://openalex.org/W1984150991,"The transmembrane protein CD36 has been identified in isolated cell studies as a putative transporter of long chain fatty acids. In humans, an association between CD36 deficiency and defective myocardial uptake of the fatty acid analog 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) has been reported. To determine whether this association represents a causal link and to assess the physiological role of CD36, we compared tissue uptake and metabolism of two iodinated fatty acid analogs BMIPP and 15-(p-iodophenyl) pentadecanoic acid (IPPA) in CD36 null and wild type mice. We also investigated the uptake and lipid incorporation of palmitate by adipocytes isolated from both groups. Compared with wild type, uptake of BMIPP and IPPA was reduced in heart (50–80%), skeletal muscle (40–75%), and adipose tissues (60–70%) of null mice. The reduction was associated with a 50–68% decrease in label incorporation into triglycerides and in 2–3-fold accumulation of label in diglycerides. Identical results were obtained from studies of [3H]palmitate uptake in isolated adipocytes. The block in diglyceride to triglyceride conversion could not be explained by changes in specific activities of the key enzymes long chain acyl-CoA synthetase and diacylglycerol acyltransferase, which were similar in tissues from wild type and null mice. It is concluded that CD36 facilitates a large fraction of fatty acid uptake by heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues and that CD36 deficiency in humans is the cause of the reported defect in myocardial BMIPP uptake. In CD36-expressing tissues, uptake regulates fatty acid esterification at the level of diacylglycerol acyltransferase by determining fatty acyl-CoA supply. The membrane transport step may represent an important control site for fatty acid metabolism in vivo.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 745-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the proteins proposed to enhance FA uptake is the transmembrane protein CD36. Expression of this protein in fibroblasts, which do not endogenously express CD36, was associated with an increase in FA uptake and incorporation into phospholipids (6Ibrahimi A. Sfeir Z. Magharaie H. Amri E.Z. Grimaldi P. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This increase reflected the appearance of a saturable, phloretin-sensitive component exhibiting a transportK m within the physiologic range of unbound FA concentrations (7–10 nm) (7Richieri G.V. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 229-240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The distribution of CD36 favors tissues with a high metabolic capacity for FA such as adipose, heart, and skeletal muscle (8Abumrad N.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In muscle tissues, CD36 expression is most abundant in red oxidative fibers and is up-regulated with muscle stimulation concomitant with an increase in the V max of FA transport (9Bonen A. Dyck D.J. Ibrahimi A. Abumrad N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E642-E649PubMed Google Scholar). Expression is also high in tissues experiencing large fluxes of FA such as capillary endothelia, mammary epithelia (10Greenwalt D.E. Mather I.H. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), or epithelia of the small intestine (11Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Mice null for CD36 were recently developed and found to exhibit increased serum FA, triglyceride, and cholesterol (12Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Their adipocytes lack the high affinity component of FA transport observed in cells isolated from wild type mice. In contrast, transgenic mice with muscle-targeted CD36 overexpression exhibit a decrease in serum FA, triglyceride, and cholesterol (13Ibrahimi A. Bonen A. Blinn W.D. Hajri T. Li X. Zhong K. Cameron R. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26761-26766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Soleus muscle from these mice displays an enhanced ability to oxidize FA in response to stimulation/contraction. In humans, CD36 deficiency has a prevalence of 0.3–11% with the higher incidences in Asian and African populations (14Lee K. Godeau B. Fromont P. Plonquet A. Debili N. Bachir D. Reviron D. Gourin J. Fernandez E. Galacteros F. Bierling P. Transfusion. 1999; 39: 873-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Deficient individuals are apparently healthy. However, a strong association between CD36 deficiency and defective myocardial uptake of the slowly oxidized FA analog 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methyl pentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) has been reported (15Tanaka T. Sohmiya K. Kawamura K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To determine whether these two defects are indeed causally related and to directly explore the contribution of CD36 to FA uptake by various tissues, we examined uptake and metabolism of [3H]palmitate and of iodinated fatty acid analogs, BMIPP and 15-(p-iodophenyl)pentadecanoic acid (IPPA), in CD36 null mice. CD36 null mice were generated by targeted homologous recombination and back-crossed 4 times to C57Bl/6. Wild type control littermates were bred from the same cross as the nulls and were therefore of identical genetic background (i.e. 93.75% C57Bl/6 and 6.25% 129SvJ) (12Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). Mice used in the experiments were 16–20 weeks in age and weighed 20–30 g. They were housed in a facility equipped with a 12-h light cycle, were given unlimited access to water, and were fed a standard pelleted diet ad libitum. Mice were either in the postprandial state or fasted for 8 h. Tail vein blood was collected into heparinized (for albumin determination) or EDTA-containing tubes (for FA determination). Serum was promptly separated from cells and stored at 4 °C. Nonesterified FA was measured by an enzymatic colorimetric assay (NEFA C, Wako Chemicals, New York) and albumin by specific binding to bromcresol green (16Doumas B.T. Watson W.A. Biggs H.G. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1971; 31: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2804) Google Scholar). BMIPP and IPPA were radioiodinated by the thallation-iodide exchange method as described previously (17Knapp Jr., F.F. Goodman M.M. Callahan A.P. Kirsch G. J. Nucl. Med. 1986; 27: 521-531PubMed Google Scholar). Purification was done over a Sep-Pak RP-18 Light cartridge (Waters Corp.). The specific activity of [125I]BMIPP was typically in the range of 2–4 Ci/mmol. The specific activity of [131I]IPPA was typically about 0.5 Ci/mmol. The radiochemical purity of each preparation as determined by TLC was greater than 99%. The purified compounds were dissolved in a minimal amount of warm absolute ethanol and added dropwise to a stirred solution of 6% FA-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 40 °C. The solution was sterile-filtered (0.22 μm, Millipore) before injection. In each experiment, animals were sex-matched, but similar results were obtained with either sex. Each mouse was injected in a lateral tail vein with 200 μl of the isotope solution (14–75 μCi). The animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 2 h, unless noted otherwise. The tissues were removed, rinsed with saline, and blotted dry. Tissues were weighed and counted in a NaI auto-gamma counter. A sample of the injected solution was also counted to determine the total injected dose. The thyroid was included as an indicator of the level of free iodine in the injected solution. Blood samples to be used for lipid extraction were added directly to vials containing 0.5 ml of a 4 mg/ml EDTA solution. Lipids were extracted from frozen tissue by the method of Folch et al.(18Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots were chromatographed next to known standards on aluminum-backed silica gel plates (Merck, from Analtech, Inc.). A petroleum ether:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) solvent system was used to resolve polar lipids, diglycerides, fatty acids, and triglycerides. The distribution of BMIPP in each lipid class was determined as a percentage of total counts on the plate. For BMIPP-labeled acyl-CoA determination, tissues were excised, rinsed with saline, and promptly frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen, and the powdered tissue (20–90 mg) was quickly weighed and homogenized in 100 mmKH2PO4, pH 4.9 (2 ml). Total long chain acyl-CoA was isolated by solid phase extraction on an oligonucleotide purification cartridge (Applied Biosystems) according to Deutschet al. (19Deutsch J. Grange E. Rapoport S.I. Purdon A.D. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). BMIPP-labeled acyl-CoA was determined by counting total long chain acyl-CoA in a NaI auto-gamma counter. Adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads of age-matched mice by collagenase (type 1, Worthington) digestion (1 mg/ml) in Krebs-Ringer medium lacking phosphate, buffered to pH 7.4 with 10 mm HEPES (KRH), and containing 2% BSA (fraction V, fatty acid-free), 2 mmglucose, and 200 nm adenosine to inhibit lipolysis. Isolated cells were washed three times with KRH with 2% BSA and then twice with KRH with 0.1% BSA and were suspended (30% v/v) in the 0.1% BSA KRH buffer. Cell density, or lipocrit, was estimated from centrifugation of 8-μl of mixed cell suspension in a hematocrit tube. Uptake of [3H]palmitate was evaluated at 25 °C as described previously (2Abumrad N.A. Park J.H. Park C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8945-8953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μl of the mixed cell suspension was added to 30 μl of transport solution containing palmitate (4000 cpm/μl) complexed to BSA at an FA to BSA molar ratio of 0.25. Uptake was stopped after 10–60 s by addition of 3 ml of cold buffer, and cells were separated from the medium by low pressure vacuum (about 50 mm Hg) filtration (Gelman A/E filters). Cell-associated radioactivity was obtained by counting the washed filters in 4 ml of aqueous scintillation fluid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a Beckman LS330 scintillation counter. Zero time radioactivity was determined from samples where cold buffer was added before cells. To determine palmitate incorporation into lipids, cells were incubated with [3H]palmitate/BSA as described above, except that incubations were for 15–30 min. Cells on the filters were Folch-extracted and the lipids analyzed by TLC on glass-backed silica gel 60 plates (Whatman). Lipid classes were resolved using a petroleum ether:diethyl ether:glacial acetic acid (70:30:1, v/v/v) solvent system. The plates were marked in 55 equal fractions, which were scraped and counted in 4 ml of aqueous scintillation fluid. Peaks were identified by standards run on each plate stained separately with iodine. This procedure gave clear separation between the major lipid fractions of interest as shown in Fig. 4. The distribution of [3H]palmitate in each lipid class was determined as a percentage of total counts on the plate.Figure 4TLC analysis of FA incorporation into complex lipids in isolated adipocytes. Isolated adipocytes were incubated for 30 min with a [3H]palmitate solution complexed with BSA in an FA to BSA molar ratio of 0.25. The cells were filtered and washed, and lipids were Folch-extracted. An aliquot of extracted lipid (20,000 cpm) was analyzed by TLC for [3H]palmitate incorporation. Lanes were divided into 3-mm fractions, scraped, and counted for activity. Peak fractions were identified by standards run on each plate. A representative lane stained with iodine is shown aligned with the activity profiles. The data are representative of three separate determinations using fat pads pooled from three mice per group. They are typical of three other experiments.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until use. Protein was determined by the Peterson-modified Lowry assay (21Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar) following lipid removal and protein precipitation according to Wessel et al. (22Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar). BSA was used as a standard. Microsomal diacylglycerol acyltransferase activity was determined as described by Coleman (20Coleman R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Control reactions containing no microsomal protein were performed in parallel to provide a background for each point. Under the assay conditions given the reaction followed zero-order kinetics with respect to substrate concentrations. Tissue-specific activities are expressed as nanomoles of triglyceride produced per min per mg of protein. Microsomal long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activity was determined according to the procedure of Tanaka et al. (23Tanaka T. Hosaka K. Numa S. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 71: 334-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) except that [3H]palmitate was solubilized with FA-free BSA in a 3:1 FA to BSA molar ratio rather than with Triton X-100 as described. Control reactions containing no microsomal protein were performed in parallel to provide a background for each point. Under the assay conditions given the reaction followed zero-order kinetics with respect to substrate concentrations. Tissue-specific activities are expressed as nanomoles of acyl-CoA produced per min per mg of protein. Results are presented as means ± S.E. The significance of differences between means was analyzed by the unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed). All reagents and standards were of the highest purity available. Iodine-125, iodine-131, [14C]palmitoyl-CoA, and [3H]palmitate were from NEN Life Science Products. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. To evaluate directly the contribution of CD36 to FA utilization by various tissues in vivo, we compared the biodistribution of the slowly oxidized FA analog [125I]BMIPP (shown in Fig.1) between wild type and CD36 null mice. The usefulness of BMIPP as a metabolic tracer for FA utilization has been demonstrated extensively in studies on both humans and laboratory animals (24Knapp Jr., F.F. Kropp J. Franken P.R. Visser F.C. Sloof G.W. Eisenhut M. Yamamichi Y. Shirakami Y. Kusuoka H. Nishimura T. Q. J. Nucl. Med. 1996; 40: 252-269PubMed Google Scholar). Like native FA, tissue extraction of BMIPP from the blood equilibrates within 2–3 min (25Torizuka K. Yonekura Y. Nishimura T. Tamaki N. Uehara T. Ikekubo K. Hino M. Kaku Igaku. 1991; 28: 681-690PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ambrose K.R. Owen B.A. Goodman M.M. Knapp Jr., F.F. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1987; 12: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of the 3-methyl group on β-oxidation results in prolonged tissue retention of the FA without affecting its incorporation into phospholipids, diglycerides, or triglycerides (27Kropp J. Ambrose K.R. Knapp Jr., F.F. Nissen H.P. Biersack H.J. Int. J. Radiat. Appl. Instrum. Part B. 1992; 19: 283-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The stable iodination of BMIPP coupled with its prolonged tissue retention make it an ideal tracer for sensitive comparisons of tissue capacities for FA uptake in vivo. Mice were injected with BMIPP in the postprandial state since under these conditions serum FA concentrations were not significantly different between null and wild type animals (TableI). The biodistribution data for BMIPP are shown in Fig. 2. Of the nine tissues examined, significant impairment of BMIPP uptake was observed only in the heart, skeletal muscle, and fat of CD36 null mice. In these tissues, uptake was reduced by 50–80% in comparison to wild type controls. In muscle tissues, the magnitude of the defect increased with increasing oxidative capacity of the muscle (Fig.3), consistent with the pattern of CD36 expression (28Bonen A. Luiken J.J. Liu S. Dyck D.J. Kiens B. Kristiansen S. Turcotte L.P. Van Der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E471-E478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, diaphragm muscle, which in the mouse is almost exclusively (95.8%) oxidative (29Green H.J. Reichmann H. Pette D. Histochemistry. 1984; 81: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), exhibited a defect in BMIPP uptake nearly 3 times that of hip muscle, which is predominantly glycolytic (30Burkholder T.J.

Previous results with mice overexpressing CD36 in muscle tissues suggested that uptake may play a rate-limiting role in determining FA oxidation in muscle (13Ibrahimi A. Bonen A. Blinn W.D. Hajri T. Li X. Zhong K. Cameron R. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26761-26766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). To determine whether FA esterification in muscle and adipose tissues is similarly limited by FA uptake, we examined whether these tissues from CD36 null mice exhibit significant reductions in FA incorporation into complex lipids. Uptake and metabolism of the native FA palmitic acid were compared in adipocytes isolated from wild type and CD36 null mice. In agreement with the BMIPP data, adipocytes from CD36 null mice exhibited a 60% decrease in the uptake of [3H]palmitate (data not shown). Evaluation of lipid extracts by TLC (Fig.4) showed that the percentage of [3H]palmitate present as free, unesterified FA was 75% lower in adipocytes isolated from CD36-deficient mice as compared with the wild type controls. The incorporation of [3H]palmitate into triglycerides was decreased by 24% in CD36 null adipocytes, whereas incorporation into diglycerides was increased by more than 3-fold. To determine whether the altered lipid incorporation observed in isolated adipocytes was representative of lipid incorporation in intact tissues in vivo, we analyzed the lipid pool distribution of BMIPP from several tissues. No differences were observed between wild type and CD36 null mice in blood, liver (TableII), or lung (not shown). In contrast, CD36-deficient heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissues (Table II) exhibited dramatic decreases in labeled triglycerides (63, 31, and 50%, respectively) with equally dramatic increases in labeled diglycerides (3.1-, 1.5-, and 1.8-fold, respectively). In CD36-deficient heart muscle the diglyceride/triglyceride ratio was increased 8-fold in comparison to wild type. No statistically significant differences were observed in BMIPP recovered as free FA, although the general trend in all experiments was toward lower levels in adipose and muscle tissues of CD36 null mice. BMIPP incorporation into polar lipids, which do not migrate in the solvent system used and would include phospholipids, monoglyceride 3-phosphate, and phosphatidic acid, was not significantly altered except in skeletal muscle where a decrease was observed.Table IIThe lipid pool distribution of BMIPPFatty acidDiglycerideTriglyceridePolar lipidsWild type (n = 3) Blood11 ± 447 ± 320 ± 215.5 ± 0.5 Liver1.8 ± 0.234 ± 227 ± 335 ± 4 Adipose2.6 ± 0.234 ± 660 ± 73.3 ± 0.6 Skeletal muscle2.65 ± 0.0750 ± 527 ± 518.6 ± 0.5 Heart3.1 ± 0.517 ± 565 ± 914 ± 3CD36 Null (n = 5) Blood8 ± 247 ± 324 ± 215.8 ± 0.5 Liver1.5 ± 0.538 ± 126 ± 233 ± 1 Adipose1.8 ± 0.460 ± 3 2-ap < 0.005.31 ± 3 2-ap < 0.005.5.5 ± 0.7 Skeletal muscle2.6 ± 0.176 ± 1 2-ap < 0.005.8.5 ± 0.6 2-ap < 0.005.9.4 ± 0.9 2-ap < 0.005.

Means, shown ± S.E., are from one experiment typical of two others. To confirm these results, mice were co-injected with [125I]BMIPP and the straight chain analog [131I]IPPA (Fig. 1). IPPA has been used extensively for evaluation of cardiac metabolism. In contrast to BMIPP, it is rapidly oxidized in tissues. Its fractional distribution in cardiac lipids has been shown to closely agree with values reported for [3H]oleic acid and [14C]palmitic acid (31Reske S.N. Sauer W. Machulla H.J. Knust J. Winkler C. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1985; 10: 228-234PubMed Google Scholar). The biodistribution of IPPA (Fig. 2, inset) and its lipid incorporation (not shown) were identical to results obtained with BMIPP. The biosynthetic pathway for triglyceride, shown in Fig. 5, highlights the steps that are altered in tissues of CD36-null mice. The observation that diglyceride accumulation was coupled to a decrease in triglycerides indicated that triglyceride synthesis was inhibited at the level of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). To determine if this reflected a tissue-specific down-regulation of the enzyme in CD36 null mice, we assayed this enzyme in microsomal fractions derived from several tissues. As seen in Fig.6 A, no significant difference in specific activity was observed between null and wild type mice in any of the tissues tested.Figure 6Activities of the microsomal enzymes (A) DGAT and (B) long chain acyl-CoA synthetase.

Because diglycerides accumulated in these tissues, inhibition was a likely result of decreased acyl-CoA. As expected, CD36 null tissues exhibiting a defect in BMIPP uptake showed a decrease of the same magnitude in BMIPP-labeled acyl-CoA (data not shown). To determine if the reduction in labeled acyl-CoA could be directly attributed to the defect in FA uptake, we assayed the activity of microsomal long chain acyl-CoA synthetase from several tissues. As with DGAT, no significant differences were observed between null and wild type tissues (Fig. 6 B). The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of CD36 in FA uptake and metabolism in vivo and to examine directly the association between CD36 deficiency and depressed myocardial FA uptake in humans (15Tanaka T. Sohmiya K. Kawamura K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). CD36-mediated uptake was determined in vivoby comparing the biodistribution of BMIPP and IPPA in tissues from CD36 null and wild type mice and in vitro by examining [3H]palmitate utilization by adipocytes isolated from both groups. Defects in uptake were confined to tissues where CD36 expression is normally high (fat, heart, and skeletal muscle), whereas no defect was observed in tissues where CD36 expression is low or undetectable (liver, kidney, lung, and large intestine). Of notable exception was the small intestine, which in the wild type mouse exhibits a high expression of CD36 (8Abumrad N.A. El-Maghrabi M.R. Amri E.Z. Lopez E. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17665-17668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2, the small intestine from null nice showed no reduction in BMIPP uptake. Although this may indicate a limited contribution of CD36 to FA uptake in this tissue, a more likely explanation is that it reflects the distribution of CD36 in the intestine, where it is localized to the lumenal membrane of brush border cells (11Poirier H. Degrace P. Niot I. Bernard A. Besnard P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Contribution of CD36 to FA uptake in the small intestine is therefore most likely confined to the absorption of dietary FA and would not have been apparent with intravenously administered BMIPP. Although a physical chemistry analysis of the process of FA diffusion through the bilayer suggests that proteins are not in principle essential for the transport of FA across membranes (32Zakim D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1996; 212: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 33Hamilton J.A. J.

Besides two melatonin G-coupled receptors, mt1 and MT2, the existence of a novel putative melatonin receptor,MT3 , was hypothesized from the observation of a binding site in both central and peripheral hamster tissues with an original binding profile and a very rapid kinetics of ligand exchange compared with mt1 and MT2. In this report, we present the purification of MT3 from Syrian hamster kidney and its identification as the hamster homologue of the human quinone reductase 2 (QR2, EC 1.6.99.2). Our purification strategy included the use of an affinity chromatography step which was crucial in purifying MT3 to homogeneity. The protein was sequenced by tandem mass spectrometry and shown to align with 95% identity with human QR2. After transfection of CHO-K1 cells with the human QR2 gene, not only did the QR2 enzymatic activity appear, but also the melatonin-binding sites with MT3 characteristics, both being below the limit of detection in the native cells. We further confronted inhibition data fromMT3 binding and QR2 enzymatic activity obtained from samples of Syrian hamster kidney or QR2-overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary cells, and observed an overall good correlation of the data.

Several high affinity melatonin receptors have been identified to date, among which the mt1(1Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Ebisawa T. Neuron. 1994; 13: 1177-1185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar) and MT2 (2Reppert S.M. Godson C. Mahle C.D. Weaver D.R. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8734-8738Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar) receptors have been cloned from human tissues. The pharmacology of these two receptors is well documented, and several compounds, including melatonin, are ligands with picomolar binding affinity (for review, see Ref. 3Dubocovich M.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 50-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Another putative melatonin receptor was identified on pharmacological grounds, with lower melatonin affinity (nanomolar range), very rapid ligand association/dissociation kinetics, and an original pharmacological profile (4Duncan M.J. Takahashi J.S. Dubocovich M.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 5Molinari E.J. North P.C. Dubocovich M.L. Eur. J.

Ther. 1999; 290: 334-340PubMed Google Scholar). In line with mt1 and MT2receptors, this putative receptor was named MT3 , according to the nomenclature recommendations of the IUPHAR (7Dubocovich M.L.

So far, the known inhibitors of MT3 hardly reach the nanomolar range and encompass an unusually large structural diversity of highly hydrophobic cyclic or polycyclic compounds (Refs. 5Molinari E.J.

Boutin, submitted for publication. All pharmacological investigations on mt1, MT2, andMT3 were performed using the radioligand [125I]melatonin, a ligand with high affinity for mt1 and MT2 (K d = 10–200 pm) and with lower affinity for MT3 (K d = 3–9 nm). The hamster kidney, liver, and brain have been used as model tissues forMT3 pharmacological studies, and our recent data confirmed that among a wide range of mammals, this rodent was indeed the best source of MT3 .1 Hence, the binding specificity for [125I]melatonin competition studies on MT3 is achieved by preparing material from hamster tissues, and the fast dissociation kinetics is overcome by operating at 4 °C. In addition, iodination of the known very specific MT3 inhibitor, 5-methoxycarbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine (MCA-NAT),2 paved the way to more accurate and reliable investigations on MT3 (5Molinari E.J. North P.C. Dubocovich M.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This ligand, combined with recently improved operating conditions, made possible for us to perform specific MT3 pharmacological studies at room temperature.1 Confident in the interest of discovering novel melatoninergic pharmacological targets, we recently set up a biochemical approach to identify and characterize MT3 . The present report describes a specific purification procedure of MT3 from hamster kidney, which led to a homogeneous single protein of 26 kDa, identified by tandem mass spectrometry as a homologue of the human quinone reductase 2 (QR2, EC 1.6.99.2). This identification was confirmed by confronting MT3 pharmacological and QR2 enzymatic data obtained under different cellular and biochemical conditions corresponding to MT3 or QR2 typical conditions. The quinone reductase family comprises two isoforms, QR1 and QR2, which have been sequenced (8Jaiswal A.K. McBride O.W. Adesnik M. Nebert D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13572-13578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and crystallized (10Li R. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Amzel L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8846-8850Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 11Foster C.E. Bianchet M.A. Talalay P. Zhao Q. Amzel L.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). QR2 lacks a 47-amino acid C-terminal sequence present in QR1, resulting in a different substrate specificity. It is noteworthy that the literature on QR2 enzymology is rather scarce (12Liao S. Dulaney J.T. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2981-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14502-14508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Interestingly, QR2 was originally discovered in 1962 as a flavoenzyme (12Liao S. Dulaney J.T. Williams-Ashman H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 2981-2987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), later re-discovered as the QR1-related enzyme (14Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), and was recently found again in porcine kidney as a puromycin aminonucleoside-binding protein (15Kodama T. Wakui H. Komatsuda A. Imai H. Miura A.B. Tashima Y. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 1997; 12: 1453-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). We now unveiled a new facet of QR2 as the melatonin-binding siteMT3, opening new perspectives in melatonin investigations as well as in quinone reduction studies. [125I]MCA-NAT (2200 Ci/mmol) was custom synthesized by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Orsay, France). 2-Iodomelatonin and MCA-NAT were purchased from Tocris (Bioblock, Illkirch, France), dihydrobenzylnicotinamide was obtained from Maybridge (Interchim, Montluçon, France), and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). Frozen hamster kidneys were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories (Saint Aubin les Elbeuf, France). The tissues were thawed, chopped, and added to 5 ml/g of homogenization buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mm CaCl2, and CompleteTM mixture of protease inhibitors). The cells were gently disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer and unbroken material and nuclei were pelleted at 280 × g. The pellet (P1) was treated identically a second time and the two 280 × g supernatants were pooled (S1) and supplemented with 5 mm final β-octyl glucopyranoside (OG) prior to a 30-min incubation under agitation. Cytoplasm and loose membrane-associated material was recovered in the supernatant of a 100,000 × gcentrifugation (SOG) and the pellet (POG) was conserved for analysis. The SOG fraction was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmCaCl2 and applied to a 6 × 5-cm DEAE Bio-Gel A column (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The elution of proteins was triggered by a stepwise gradient of 0–1 mNaCl in the application buffer and was monitored by absorbence at 280 nm. The fractions of interest were pooled and dialyzed against the application buffer, concentrated by laying the dialysis tubing onto 20,000 Da polyethylene glycol, and further dialyzed against the application buffer. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Most often, the OG solubilization sample SOG was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until application on the ion-exchange phase. For binding studies, this partially purified MT3 sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2 in order to remove the sucrose which inhibited MCA-NAT binding. The final DEAE sample was frozen identically before further purification or analysis. The ligandN-[2-(7-amino-1-naphthyl)ethyl]-acetamide (S27145, Fig. 1) was prepared in three steps from agomelatine (S20098 (16Depreux P. Lesieur D. Mansour H.A. Morgan P. Howell H.E. Renard P. Caignard D.H. Pfeiffer B. Delagrange P. Guardiola B. J. Med. Chem. 1994; 37: 3231-3239Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar)) and attached to the polymer resin over a spacer, in two further steps, as follows. A solution of N-[2-(7-methoxy-1-naphthyl)ethyl]acetamide (10 g, 41 mmol) in DCM (50 ml) was treated with BBr3 (25 ml) at −15 °C under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was kept at −15 °C for 1 h, then poured on, hydrolyzed with 1 nNaHCO3 and extracted with methylethylketone. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The residue was taken up with DCM (100 ml) and the precipitate collected and dried to afford 8.77 g (93%) ofN-[2-(7-hydroxy-1-naphthyl)ethyl]acetamide (compound1). A solution 1 (8.7 g, 38 mmol) in DCM (400 ml) was treated with triethylamine (6.9 ml, 50 mmol) andN-phenyl-bistrifluoromethane sulfonimide (20 g, 53 mmol). The reaction mixture was refluxed for 12 h, then cooled, concentrated, taken up with diethyl ether, washed with 1 nNaHCO3, water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The crude product was purified on silica gel with DCM/ethyl acetate (95:5) to afford 11.5 g (84%) ofN-[2-(7-trifluoromethylsulfoxy-1-naphthyl)ethyl]acetamide (compound 2). A mixture of 2 (4.0 g, 11 mmol) with benzophenonimine (7 g, 38 mmol), bis(diphenylphosphino-1–1′-binaphthalene (310 mg, 0.5 mmol), palladium acetate (70 mg, 0.3 mmol), and cesium carbonate (5 g, 15 mmol) in dimethoxyethane (160 ml) was refluxed under nitrogen for 12 h. The resulting reaction mixture was hydrolyzed with water and extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was washed with 10% citric acid and water, then dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated. The resulting crude product was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (150 ml), treated with 1n HCl (200 ml), and heated at 60 °C for 1 h. The reaction was cooled, extracted with diethyl ether, and the aqueous phase was brought to pH 11 with NaOH, then extracted with DCM. The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated, and purified on silica gel in DCM/methanol (97:3) to afford 1.44 g ofN-[2-(7-amino-1-naphthyl)ethyl]acetamide. The corresponding hydrochloride salt (1.61 g, 55%, compound 3) was obtained by treatment of the base in ethyl acetate with HCl in diethyl ether. Compound 3 (876 mg, 3.31 mmol) and 6-tert-butoxycarbonylamino hexanoic acid (1.15 g, 4.97 mmol) were dissolved in DCM (20 ml) and neat HATU (1.89 g, 4.97 mmol) was added in one single portion, followed by a slow addition of diisopropylethylamine (2.57 g, 14.90 mmol). After a 15-min reaction at room temperature, high performance liquid chromatography showed no remaining amine and one major new product. Ethyl acetate (100 ml) was then added and the solution washed 3 times with brine (3 × 25 ml), 1 m HCl (3 × 25 ml), 5% NaHCO3(3 × 25 ml), and brine (3 × 25 ml), dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under vacuum. The yield of {5-[7-(2-acetylamino-ethyl)-naphthalen-2-ylcarbamoyl]-pentyl}-carbamic acid tert-butyrate, compound 4 (1.4 g), was 95% and its high performance liquid chromatography purity was 99%. The Boc group was deprotected by treatment of 4 (1.40 g, 3.17 mmol) with trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml) in DCM (20 ml). After 15 min at room temperature, the solution was evaporated under vacuum and lyophilized in water/acetonitrile (9:1). The trifluoroacetic acid salt was then attached to the Novasyn TG carboxy resin (Novabiochem, 0.25 mmol/g) (12 g) on a semiautomatic synthesizer with axial shaking, using HATU (1.21 g, 3.17 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (2.05 ml, 11.88 mmol) in a mixture of 200 ml of DCM/DMF (1:1) as solvent. The reaction mixture was shaken for 64 h at room temperature. After filtration, the usual washings were performed: 3 × with DMF and isopropyl alcohol, alternatively and 3 times with DCM. The resin was then capped by treatment with a large excess of glycine methyl ester hydrochloride (3.98 g, 31.7 mmol) using HATU (12.05 g, 31.7 mmol) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (7.65 ml, 44.4 mmol) in 200 ml of a mixture of DCM/DMF (1:1). The same washings were performed after filtration. Estimation of the substitution level of the resin was carried out by microanalysis of the nitrogen percentage content: 0.11 mmol ligand/g of resin. The partially purified MT3 sample was subjected to affinity chromatography at 4 °C. The phase was synthesized as described above and used in a batch procedure. It was washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2 and mixed with the sample at a ratio of 50 μg of protein/mg of phase. The incubation was performed for 15 min under gentle agitation after which the sedimentation of the resin was left to occur. The unbound material was removed by pipetting over the supernatant and the phase was washed twice with the equilibration buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by incubating the phase for 15 min in the equilibration buffer supplemented with 50 μmMCA-NAT. The eluate was recovered by pipetting, dialyzed against water, and concentrated on polyethylene glycol as described above. The precipitate obtained in dry ice-cold acetone was dried under a flow of nitrogen and analyzed by Laemmli polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The proteins were detected in the gel by Coomassie Blue. The protein spot in the Laemmli electrophoresis performed after affinity chromatography was excised from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and washed with 50% acetonitrile. Gel pieces were dried in a vacuum centrifuge and reswollen in 20 μl of 25 mmNH4 HCO3 containing 0.5 μg of trypsin (Promega, sequencing grade). After 4 h incubation at 37 °C, the gel pieces were extracted with 5% formic acid and acetonitrile. The extracts were evaporated to dryness. The residues were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid and desalted using a Zip Tip (Millipore). Elution of the peptides was performed with 5–10 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid solution. The peptide solution was introduced onto a glass capillary (Protana) for nanoelectrospray ionization. Tandem mass spectrometry experiments were carried out on a Q-TOF hybrid mass spectrometer (Micromass, Altrincham, United Kingdom) in order to obtain sequence information. MS/MS sequence information was used for data base searching using the programs MS-Edman located at the University of California San Francisco and BLAST located at the NCBI. The QR2 coding sequence was isolated by reverse transcriptase-polymease chain reaction from human liver mRNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) using the 5′ sense primer (5′-GAATTCTCCACCATGGCAGGTAAGAAAGTACTCATGTC-3′, nucleotides 176–202) and the 3′ antisense primer (5′-GCGGCCGCTCATTATTGCCCGAAGTGCCAGTGGGCTGTGC-3′, nucleotides 843–871) generated from the published sequence (Ref.9Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar; access number JO2888). Liver mRNA (200 ng) was reverse-transcribed with oligo(dT)12–18 in accordance with the first-strand cDNA synthesis protocol from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in 100 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 2 μl of the single-stranded cDNA preparation, 0.3 μm of each primer, and 2 units of pfu native polymerase (Stratagene) with a 35 cycles program of 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min and a final extension at 72 °C for 8 min. The amplified cDNA was then subcloned in-frame into EcoRI andNotI site of the pcDNA3.1(+) vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). CHO-K1 cells maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 500 IU/ml penicillin, and 500 μg/ml streptomycin were transiently transfected by the pcDNA3.1(+)-QR2 plasmid using LipofectAMINE as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies). Fourty-eight hours after the beginning of transfection, the adherent cells were washed by phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 10 ml of homogenization buffer (see “Purification ofMT3 ,” above) and transferred from flask to flask. The cell supension obtained was adjusted to 0.2 msucrose and spun at 280 × g. The resulting nuclei-free supernatant was assayed for protein andMT3 /QR2 content. All assays were performed in triplicate and data presented herein are representative of two to six individual experiments. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (18Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. TheMT3 binding was performed according to our original procedure.1 Briefly, 100 μg (samples from animals) or 20 μg (samples from CHO) of proteins were incubated at 20–22 °C for 10–20 min with 200 pm [125I]MCA-NAT in the presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of 10 μm MCA-NAT and, for competition studies, with varying concentrations of test compounds. The final volume was 150 μl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2. Incubation was stopped by filtration through a 96-well filtration support disposed directly onto a Multiscreen filtering apparatus (Milllipore) connected to a vacuum pump, allowing rapid filtration after the samples were loaded using a 96-well pipetting device (Transtar, Costar). The filter-associated radioactivity was measured in a β-scintillation counter (TopCount NXT, Packard). Samples from CHO culture and from the purification of MT3 up to the ion exchange chromatography step were analyzed on glass fiber filters (GF/B Unifilter, Packard), while elution from the ion-exchange resin was followed using polyvinylidene difluoride filters (ImmobilonTM Multiscreen, Millipore) pre-soaked in methanol and rinsed three times by 200 μl of binding buffer. Alternatively, samples from the final purification steps, affinity chromatography, and ion exchange chromatography as an internal reference, were assayed forMT3 binding using 96-well format size-exclusion chromatography. Eighty μl of dry Sephadex G-25 fine (APB) were distributed into 96-well format polyvinylidene difluoride filters (DuraporeTM Multiscreen, Millipore) using a Multiscreen powder dispensing apparatus. The exclusion phase was hydrated with 250 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and spun at 550 × g for 1 min in a 96-well plate basket. The phase was further rinsed three times using 120 μl of the same buffer, left to equilibrate at 4 °C for 30 min, and spun before sample application. The samples were preincubated at 4 °C during 30 min with 200 pm [125I]MCA-NAT as described above, and 120 μl of the mixture were loaded onto the exclusion phase. The plates were immediately spun at 550 × g for 1 min. The free radioligand was excluded from the eluate by diffusion in the chromatographic medium, and 90 μl of the eluate were used for scintillation counting. For competition studies, the data presented are affinity constants (K i) calculated from specific binding values of logarithmic compound concentrations, according to the method of Cheng and Prusoff (19Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar). The measurements of QR1and QR2 quinone reductase activities were adapted from Jaiswal et al. (9Jaiswal A.K. Burnett P. Adesnik M. McBride O.W. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and Zhao et al. (14Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). QR1 activity was measured using 100 μmmenadione as substrate and 100 μm NADH as co-substrate, while QR2 activity was measured using 100 μmmenadione as substrate, 100 μm dihydrobenzylnicotinamide (BNAH) as co-substrate, and 100 μm dicoumarol as QR1 inhibitor. In both cases, the activities were measured at 25 °C in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm OG and the reactions were followed at 440 nm using the intrinsic fluorescence of the two co-substrates with excitation at 340 nm (PolarStar 96-well plate reader, BMG, Offenburg, Germany). Samples were diluted before use in the measurement buffer supplemented with 10% glycerol, in order to apply the desired amount of protein in 20 μl. The instrument was calibrated using a range of co-substrate concentrations. The IC50 values were calculated from inhibition curves using semi-logarithmic plots of the compound concentrations (8 points). This work primarily focused on the melatonin-binding site MT 3, which was studied and purified using [125I]MCA-NAT binding (5Molinari E.J. North P.C. Dubocovich M.L. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) as a specific assay, designated herein as the “MT 3assay.” Purification of MT 3 from hamster kidney provided “partially purified MT 3” and “MT 3 purified to homogeneity.” The cloning and expression of the human QR2 gene in CHO provided an identified source of this enzyme, which was assayed using the well described oxidoreduction mechanism involving a quinone (electron acceptor) and a nicotinic derivative (electron donor). For assaying the QR2 enzymatic activity, menadione was the substrate and a commercially available fluorescent NADH analogue, dihydrobenzylnicotinamide (BNAH, Powell et al. (20Powell M.F. Wong W.H.

Dicoumarol, a potent QR1 inhibitor and poor QR2 inhibitor (14Zhao Q. Yang X.L. Holtzclaw W.D. Talalay P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1669-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) was added to the assay to ensure QR2 specificity. Control assays of QR1 activity were performed when necessary, using menadione as the substrate and NADH as the co-substrate, which provided good QR1 specificity since NADH is a very poor co-substrate for QR2 (14Zhao Q.

Boutin, unpublished observations. , Although, in the light of our results presented thereafter, MT 3 and QR2 seem to designate a unique protein, for convenience in the present report, we alternatively refer to hamsterMT 3 orMT 3/QR2 and human QR2, depending on the methodological approach involved. The purification of the melatonin-binding siteMT 3 was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and the intermediate fractions were assayed for [125I]MCA-NAT binding and QR2enzymatic activity. QR1 activity was also assayed in all samples as a control. We started the purification of theMT 3 melatonin-binding site by preparing a nuclei-free subcellular fraction, from which MT 3was recovered with high yield in the supernatant of a 100,000 ×g centrifugation after mild detergent treatment (5 mm octylglucoside). Dialysis removed most of the detergent molecules thanks to the high critical micellar concentration of OG (CMCOG = 25 mm (21Helenius A. McCaslin D.R. Fries E. Tanford C. Method. Enzymol. 1979; 56: 734-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar)). The dialysate was applied to a DEAE anion exchanger, from which MT 3 was eluted by a discontinuous gradient of NaCl. TheMT3 containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed in order to remove the NaCl. Finally, we purifiedMT 3 to homogeneity using an original affinity phase developed on the basis of the most specificMT 3 ligand known to date, MCA-NAT. The synthetic ligand (S27145, Fig. 1) bears an amine function in position 7 of naphthylethylacetamide, which was substituted by a 6-aminohexanoyl moiety in order to mimic the carbonylamide function of MCA-NAT. The free amino group of the aminohexanoic spacer was used for the attachment to the affinity matrix, a polyethylene glycol-derivatized polystyrene resin. The use of a naphthyl ring eliminated the photosensitivity associated with the indole ring. The affinity chromatographic step was performed at 4 °C in a batch procedure, and the proteins specifically adsorbed on the phase were eluted by 50 μm MCA-NAT. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, where it appeared as a single band of 26 kDa (Fig. 2). The band was recovered from the electrophoresis acrylamide gel as a trypsin digest and was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The resulting five peptidic sequences were compared with protein data bases for alignment and showed 95% similarity with the human quinone reductase 2, QR2 (Fig. 3). TableI displays the yields of the successive purification steps as calculated from MT 3binding and QR2 enzymatic assay data. The [125I]MCA-NAT binding data are in good agreement with the QR2 enzymatic data, with a 2.5–3.5-fold enrichment ofMT 3/QR2 in the OG supernatant, and a 12.5–13.5-fold enrichment after DEAE chromatography, while QR1 was barely detectable in the ion exchange chromatography eluate. After the affinity chromatographic step, the purification of MT3 , as evaluated by [125I]MCA-NAT binding and QR2 enzymatic assay, reached a 10,000-fold factor of enrichment, confirming the identity of MT3 with QR2. Absorption and desorption of the protein preparation from the affinity medium gave a relatively low yield of recovery of MT3 and QR2 signals (about 20%), probably due to the rapid kinetics of ligand exchange of MT3 . Indeed, the dissociation constant at room temperature is about 0.3 s−1,1 and performing the affinity chromatographic step at 4 °C could not completely counterbalance the rapid dissociation kinetics.Figure 3Seq"
https://openalex.org/W2022309233,"Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) is a key component in many biological processes including insulin and Wnt signaling. Since the activation of each signaling pathway results in a decrease in GSK3β activity, we examined the specificity of their downstream effects in the same cell type. Insulin induces an increased activity of glycogen synthase but has no influence on the protein level of β-catenin. In contrast, Wnt increases the cytosolic pool of β-catenin but not glycogen synthase activity. We found that, unlike insulin, neither the phosphorylation status of the serine9 residue of GSK3β nor the activity of protein kinase B is regulated by Wnt. Although the decrease in GSK3β activity is required, GSK3β may not be the limiting component for Wnt signaling in the cells that we examined. Our results suggest that the axin-conductin complexed GSK3β may be dedicated to Wnt rather than insulin signaling. Insulin and Wnt pathways regulate GSK3β through different mechanisms, and therefore lead to distinct downstream events.

Wang A. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6061-6065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many proteins other than GS also contain GSK3 recognition sequences, some of which can be phosphorylated by GSK3in vitro. These include ATP-citrate lyase, protein phosphatase 1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, eIF2B, inhibitor-2, c-Jun, Myc, Myb, CREB, Tau, β-catenin, and IκB (4Welsh G.I. Wilson C. Proud C.G.

GSK3 is conserved from yeast to mammals and has been implicated in strikingly versatile biological functions. However, how different signals regulate GSK3 is still unknown. GSK3 plays an important role in the cellular response to insulin (7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The regulation of GSK3 by insulin has been shown to be mediated by protein kinase B (PKB). Upon insulin stimulation, threonine 308 (Thr-308) and serine 473 (Ser-473) residues of PKB are phosphorylated and PKB is activated (8Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2476) Google Scholar). Subsequently, both GSK3 isotypes (GSK3α and GSK3β) in mammalian cells are phosphorylated on a serine residue at the N terminus (serine 21 of GSK3α and serine 9 of GSK3β) (9Sutherland C. Leighton I.A. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar), which leads to a decrease in GSK3 activity. Although this has usually been detected as a 50–70% drop, it is apparently sufficient to relieve the inhibition of GS and allow cells to complete glycogen synthesis. Another in vitro substrate of GSK3β is β-catenin, a protein involved in cell adhesion, oncogenesis and development (11Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar, 12Bullions L.C. Levine A.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 13Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Together with axin-conductin and APC, GSK3β is one of the components of a protein complex that regulates the stability of β-catenin (14Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 15Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the GSK3β sites in the N terminus of β-catenin is believed to be a signal for degradation. When either APC or the GSK3β sites of β-catenin are mutated, as in 90% of colon cancer, levels of β-catenin are elevated (13Polakis P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Excess β-catenin accumulates in the cytosol and nucleus, outside of cell adhesion complexes on cytoplasmic membrane where it normally resides. Nuclear β-catenin is capable of interacting with the LEF/TCF family DNA-binding proteins and activating transcription of genes containing LEF/TCF binding sites (18Behrens J. von Kries J.P. Kuhl M.

Korinek V. Roose J. Destree O. Clevers H. Cell. 1996; 86: 391-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Increased β-catenin levels can also be achieved through the activation of Wnt/wingless signaling pathway (20Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). GSK3β has been placed between Dishevelled (Dvl in mammalian cells, Dsh in other organisms) and β-catenin in the Wnt pathway based on a combination of genetic and biochemical evidence (21Hooper J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 22Siegfried E. Wilder E.L. Perrimon N. Nature. 1994; 367: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 23Smalley M.J.

It is not clear how the extracellular Wnt signal is transduced from the membrane receptor Frizzled to Dsh/Dvl, and then to GSK3β resulting in increased β-catenin levels. Decreases in the activity of GSK3β have been observed in mouse fibroblasts andDrosophila cells responding to wingless and Dsh (24Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21790-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inhibition of GSK3β activity by lithium salt or GSK3β-binding protein (GBP/FRAT) mimics Wnt signaling (26Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yost C. Farr III, G.H. Pierce S.B. Ferkey D.M. Chen M.M. Kimelman D. Cell. 1998; 93: 1031-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Recently, it is reported that Dvl and GBP/FRAT are able to associate with the axin-conductin-APC-β-catenin complex (23Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Moreover, this entire complex is believed to dissociate in response to Wnt signaling (20Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated how different signals such as insulin and Wnt regulate GSK3β. Using mammalian cells that respond to both signals, we found that the downstream effect is specific to each pathway, despite the indistinguishable decrease in GSK3β activity. We also generated the first inducible system to conditionally activate Dishevelled in mammalian cells as an independent method to turn on the Wnt signaling pathway. Serine 9 of GSK3β is not regulated in cells that are activated by Wnt or Dishevelled. Furthermore, we have evidence that the axin-conductin complexed GSK3β is not significantly phosphorylated at serine 9 upon insulin stimulation and, therefore, may be protected from insulin signaling. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from ATCC. C57MG, Rat2-MV7, and Rat2-Wnt1 cell lines were generous gifts from Dr. Anthony Brown. These cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.). CHOIR cells were kindly given by Drs. Richard Roth (29Dickens M. Chin J.E. Roth R.A. Ellis L. Denton R.M. Tavare J.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and Ira Goldfine, maintained in Ham's F12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). All cell culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). For conditioned media, Rat2-MV7 and Rat2-Wnt1 were grown to 95% confluence. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and maintained in serum-free DMEM overnight. The conditioned media were filtered through 0.22-μm filter units, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. For insulin or Wnt stimulation, cells were grown to 70–80% confluence and serum-starved overnight, after which 5 μg/ml insulin or 0.2 ml/cm2 conditioned medium was added. Transfections of plasmids were performed by using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) or FuGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to instructions from the manufacturer. To generate 293-D-ER cells, 293 cells were transfected with the Dvl-ER plasmid. Selection with 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.) started 24 h after transfection. Resistant cells were pooled together after two rounds of complete killing of the parental 293 cells. Once these cells were verified to have stable expression and inducible Dvl-ER, they were transfected with the His6-tagged conductin plasmid. 25 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen) was used to select for 293-D-ER-His6-conductin cells. Mammalian expression plasmid encoding human Dishevelled 2 was a generous gift from Dr. Misha Semenov (30Semenov M.V. Snyder M. Genomics. 1997; 42: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The coding region of Dishevelled 2 was also epitope-tagged with Glu-Glu (EE) tag and fused to the hormone binding domain of a modified version of the murine estrogen receptor (Dvl-ER). Conductin expression plasmid was from Dr. Walter Birchmeier (16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar), and was then epitope-tagged with the EE tag in pCDNA3 or His6 tag in pCDNA6. TOPTK reporter plasmid for TCF/LEF-dependent transcription was from Dr. Hans Clevers (31Korinek V. Barker N. Morin P.J. van Wichen D. de Weger R. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Clevers H. Science. 1997; 275: 1784-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2896) Google Scholar). Dominant negative form of TCF4 (DNTCF4) expression plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Osamu Tetsu (32Tetsu O. McCormick F. Nature. 1999; 398: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (3225) Google Scholar). cDNA encoding human GSK3β in pBlueScriptSK+ was from Dr. James Woodgett (33Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). GSK3β was amplified from this template by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into a pCDNA3-based plasmid with an N-terminal HA tag. Mutants of GSK3 were created by using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Three versions of kinase-dead GSK3β were made with amino acid substitutions at the ATP binding site: lysine 85 to alanine, lysine 85 and 86 to arginines, and lysine 85 to methionine plus lysine 86 to alanine. Anti-GSK3β and anti-β-catenin antibodies were from Transduction Laboratory. Phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 and anti-PKB antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology. Phosphospecific antibody against Ser-9 of GSK3β was from Quality Controlled Biochemicals. Phosphospecific antibodies against PKB were generously provided by Dr. David Stokoe. Anti-EE antibody was from Harlan Bioproducts. Anti-HA antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. To prepare cytosolic fractions, cells were washed and collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell pellets were resuspended in ice-cold hypotonic buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were lysed after incubating on ice for 10 min (verified by microscope). The lysates were subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed in IP buffer (125 mmNaCl, 25 mm NaF, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm NaVO3, 200 nmokadaic acid, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Anti-GSK3β, anti-HA, or anti-EE antibody was added to clarified lysates for 1 h at 4 °C, and then Protein G beads (Sigma) were added for another 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with IP buffer. To coimmunopricipitate GSK3β with His6-conductin, Ni-IP buffer was used. Ni-IP buffer was IP buffer without EDTA, EGTA, or dithiothreitol and supplemented with EDTA-free Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nickel beads (ProBond resin, Invitrogen) were first blocked with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in Ni-IP buffer for 2 h. After incubating with cleared lysates, nickel beads were washed three times with Ni-IP buffer supplemented with 200 mm immidazole and then once with Ni-IP buffer. Western blotting was carried out following standard procedures. 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gels were used. For GSK3β kinase assays, GSK3β immunoprecipitates were washed once with kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2) first. Kinase reactions were performed in kinase buffer with 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 100 μm2BSP peptide as the substrate (synthesized by the Biomedical Resource Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA). 2BSP is based on the GSK3 target site in eIF2B (34Welsh G.I. Patel J.C. Proud C.G. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 244: 16-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After 20 min at 30 °C, the reactions were spotted on phosphocellulose P81 paper (Whatman), washed four times with 100 mm phosphoric acid, and counted in scintillation counter. Luciferase assays were performed by using dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Microplate Luminometer (EG&G Berthold). Transfection efficiency was normalized to the expression ofRenilla luciferase from the cotransfected pRL-TK plasmid. GS assays were performed as described previously (35Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10228-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Parallel assays were performed using low (0.1 mm) and high (10 mm) concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate to give active and total activities of GS. GS activity was calculated as the fraction of active from total activity. Cells in 10-cm dishes were grown to 70–80% confluence, serum-starved for 8 h in regular DMEM, then metabolically labeled with 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in serum-free and phosphate-free DMEM for overnight. After 10 min of insulin or conditioned media stimulation, GSK3β was immunoprecipitated as described above and processed for phosphopeptide mapping as described previously (33Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). To compare the regulation of GSK3β by insulin and Wnt, we needed to choose cell lines that respond to both signals. In this study, we used conditioned media from a stable Rat2 cell line expressing mouse Wnt-1 as a source of Wnt protein (36Bradley R.S. Brown A.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4616-4622Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We first tested the effect of the Wnt conditioned media on human embryonic 293 cells as this epithelial cell line does respond to insulin (37Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We observed a maximal decrease in GSK3β activity at 10 min after the addition of Wnt media to cells (Fig. 1 A). Wnt media also caused an accumulation of the cytosolic fraction of β-catenin, which peaked at about 3 h after stimulation (Fig.1 B). These results again place mammalian GSK3 upstream of β-catenin and downstream of Wnt. Similar results were also seen with C57MG (C57) cells, an immortalized mouse mammary gland epithelial cell line (data not shown). We then examined the relationship between Dsh/Dvl and GSK3β in 293 cells. Overexpression of Dsh/Dvl is known to activate the Wnt pathway and give rise to elevated levels of cytosolic β-catenin (23Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 38Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). We utilized a luciferase reporter driven by TCF/LEF binding sites (TOPTK) to measure the activity of transient overexpression of human Dishevelled 2 (hDvl2) (Fig. 1 C). Wild type GSK3β and a dominant negative form of the TCF4 transcription factor (DNTCF4) blocked hDvl2 activity (Fig.1 C). GSK3β mutants that retain kinase activity, including serine 9 mutated to alanine or glutamic acid, and tyrosine 216 mutated to phenylalanine or glutamic acid, also retained the ability to block hDvl2 activity (see below and data not shown). In contrast, coexpression of kinase-dead mutants of GSK3β did not have any effect on the activity of hDvl2, nor did coexpression of active MEKK, an irrelevant protein kinase (Fig. 1 C). Similar results were also obtained from same experiments using CHOIR, a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing human insulin receptor (data not shown). Due to the low transfection efficiency of C57 cells, CHOIR and 293 cells were used for experiments involving transient transfections. These observations confirmed that a decrease in GSK3β activity is necessary to convey signals from Dvl to β-catenin and GSK3β is downstream of Dvl in mammalian cells. Since GSK3β is a major player in both insulin and Wnt signaling, we compared changes in GSK3β activity upon insulin and Wnt stimulation. A similar decrease in GSK3β activity was observed in 3 cell lines, 293, CHOIR and C57 (Fig. 2 A). We then examined the downstream events of activated insulin and Wnt pathways. The level of cytosolic β-catenin was increased in cells stimulated by Wnt but unchanged in insulin-treated cells (Fig. 2 B). GS activity was analyzed in CHOIR and C57 cells. Insulin-stimulated cells yielded higher GS activity, while Wnt conditioned media had no effect (Fig.2 C). 293 cells had high basal GS activity, and no significant activity increase was detected with insulin treatment (data not shown). These data represent an example of specificity in signaling, yet raised the question how different downstream effects were achieved through a seemingly indistinguishable change in the activity of GSK3β, a common component of the two signaling pathways. Serine 9 (Ser-9) is a key regulation site of GSK3β responding to insulin signaling (7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Using a phosphospecific antibody against phospho-Ser-9 in GSK3β, we were able to detect a clear increase of phosphorylation on this residue upon insulin stimulation in CHOIR and C57 cells (Fig.3 A). However, we did not observe any obvious difference of phospho-Ser-9 reactivity in samples treated with Wnt media or control media. The phosphotyrosine content remained constant before and after either insulin or Wnt stimulation. Similar results were observed from 293 cells (data not shown). Since PKB is known to be the upstream regulator of GSK3 in insulin signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of two key residues in PKB, Thr-308 and Ser-473, using phosphospecific antibodies. There was a strong increase in phosphorylation of both residues responding to insulin but not to Wnt (Fig. 3 B). We also metabolically labeled cells in vivo with [32P]orthophosphate before treatment with insulin or Wnt. We did not detect any significant changes in the total level of phosphorylation or phosphoamino acid analysis of GSK3β, although it confirmed that the majority of phosphorylation was on serine residues (data not shown). Phosphopeptide mapping was also performed (Fig.3 C). The phosphopeptide pattern for GSK3β from C57 cells treated with control or Wnt media appeared to be essentially the same. Nevertheless, GSK3β from insulin-treated cells elicited a distinctive increase in phosphorylation at the positions corresponding to peptides containing Ser-9 (33Stambolic V. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Similar patterns were obtained from 293 and CHOIR cells (data not shown). We then examined the response of a Ser-9 to alanine mutant of GSK3β (S9A-GSK3β) to insulin and Wnt signals. 293 or CHOIR cells transiently expressing an HA-epitope-tagged wild type or S9A mutant of GSK3β were stimulated with insulin or Wnt conditioned media. The kinase activity of S9A-GSK3β no longer decreased in response to insulin (Fig. 4 A), similar to what was reported previously (37Shaw M. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Upon Wnt stimulation, the S9A mutant exhibited an activity drop similar to that for the wild type kinase (Fig. 4 A). We also tested the ability of S9A to block Wnt signal by hDvl2 (Fig. 4 B). At higher expression level, both S9A mutant or wild type GSK3β efficiently blocked hDvl2-activated TCF/LEF-driven luciferase activity. Interestingly, at lower expression level, S9A was able to block hDvl2 activity roughly 2-fold better than the wild type GSK3β. This is probably due to the higher intrinsic kinase activity of S9A mutant that we and others have observed (35Eldar-Finkelman H. Argast G.M. Foord O. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10228-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similar effects were observed using CHOIR cells (data not shown). GSK3β has been found in the axin-conductin-APC-β-catenin complex (16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar, 17Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Because of the multitude of biological processes that GSK3β is involved in, it is reasonable to hypothesize that only a fraction of the total cellular GSK3β is in the axin-conductin complex. We investigated the response of GSK3β in the axin-conductin complex to insulin or Wnt. From CHOIR cells with insulin or Wnt treatment, endogenous GSK3β was coimmunoprecipitated with ectopically expressed EE-tagged conductin (EE-conductin). Only a small fraction of GSK3β was coimmunoprecipitated with EE-conductin and Ser-9 phosphorylation status of these GSK3β was not altered in response to Wnt media (Fig.5 A). After insulin treatment, we observed a much less significant increase in phosphorylation on Ser-9 of the GSK3β that was coimmunoprecipitated with EE-conductin. Phosphorylation on tyrosine residues were constant (data not shown).In vitro kinase assays were also performed on the pool of GSK3β that coimmunoprecipitated with EE-conductin (Fig.5 B). We observed decreased kinase activity of GSK3β responding to Wnt. Furthermore, in response to insulin, the decrease in kinase activity of this subpool of GSK3β seemed to be less prominent than the total pool of GSK3β. As the most upstream intracellular component of the Wnt pathway, Dvl is capable of activating downstream molecules independent of the extracellular ligand Wnt (23Smalley M.J. Sara E. Paterson H. Naylor S. Cook D. Jayatilake H. Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 25Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21790-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 38Yanagawa S. van Leeuwen F. Wodarz A. Klingensmith J. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). To further substantiate our findings described in the earlier sections, we also investigated the response of GSK3β to activated Dvl. We chose to generate a fusion protein between Dvl and a modified version of the hormone binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor (Dvl-ER) and use this as our inducible system to achieve rapid activation of the Wnt pathway (39Littlewood T.D. Hancock D.C. Danielian P.S. Parker M.G. Evan G.I. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1686-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Expression of Dvl-ER activates TOPTK reporter activity in a hormone (4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-HT))-dependent manner (data not shown). A 293 cell line was then made to stably express Dvl-ER (293-D-ER). As shown in Fig.6 A, cytosolic β-catenin accumulated upon 4-HT treatment in 293-D-ER cells. We then examined the phosphorylation status of the Ser-9 residue of GSK3β. In this cell line, there remains a strong increase of phosphorylation of Ser-9 of GSK3β in response to insulin (Fig. 6 B). 4-HT treatment did not cause any significant change in Ser-9 phosphorylation (Fig.6 B). Furthermore, a His6-tagged conductin was integrated into 293-D-ER cells (293-D-ER-His6-conductin) so that the conductin-bound pool of GSK3β can be coimmunoprecipitated using nickel beads. Upon either insulin or 4-HT stimulation, the phosphorylation of Ser-9 on this pool of GSK3β was not significantly altered (Fig. 6 C). GSK3β has been implicated in mediating many diverse signals in various cell types. It is believed that many signals can down-regulate the kinase activity of GSK3β. How different signaling pathways achieve specificity through GSK3β remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the differential regulation of GSK3β by two extracellular signals, insulin and Wnt. Although both signals decrease GSK3β activity to a similar extent, we found that insulin and Wnt lead to very distinct downstream events. Furthermore, unlike in insulin signaling, Ser-9 of GSK3β is not phosphorylated by the Wnt signaling pathway. In any given organism, many cells will receive and respond to multiple extracellular signals. The cell lines that we chose for this study, for example, are able to respond to both insulin and Wnt. Insulin stimulation leads to increased glycogen synthesis, whereas Wnt causes accumulation of β-catenin. As expected, we observed a decrease in GSK3β activity in response to both insulin and Wnt. Decrease in GSK3β activity is sometimes sufficient to lead to downstream events. For example, lithium as a cell-permeable, noncompetitive inhibitor of GSK3β is able to mimic insulin in adipocytes (40Cheng K. Creacy S. Larner J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1983; 56: 183-189PubMed Google Scholar) and Wnt signaling in Drosophila cells (26Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HGF was shown to down-regulate GSK3β activity and up-regulate β-catenin level (41Papkoff J. Aikawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 851-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). However, we found that insulin did not cause β-catenin accumulation and Wnt did not increase glycogen synthase activity. Therefore, the effect of each signaling pathway is highly specific. A similar finding was reported by Staal et al. (42Staal F.J. Burgering B.M. van de Wetering M. Clevers H.C. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) that T cell activation causes decrease in GSK3β activity but no change in β-catenin accumulation. A large body of evidence suggests that the regulation of GSK3β by insulin is a phosphorylation event at Ser-9 via activated PKB (7Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 10Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4292) Google Scholar). One way to achieve specificity via a common intermediate in different pathways could be through different posttranslational modifications. GSK3β activity can be down-regulated independent of Ser-9 phosphorylation or PKB in exercised muscle (43Markuns J.F. Wojtaszewski J.F. Goodyear L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24896-24900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We demonstrated that Wnt signaling did not cause Thr-308 or Ser-473 phosphorylation on PKB, nor was Ser-9 of GSK3β modified. Supporting our data, Yuan et al. (44Yuan H. Mao J. Li L. Wu D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30419-30423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reported that activation of PKB alone is not sufficient to mimic Wnt signaling. However, in their report, exogenous PKB had a synergistic effect on β-catenin with exogenously expressed Wnt1 or Frat1. We did not find any synergistic effect if we stimulated cells with insulin and Wnt simultaneously (data not shown). It is possible that, although activating Wnt signaling does not rely on the activity of PKB, addition of active PKB in higher amounts than ordinary insulin stimulation can still act on one of its substrates, GSK3β. This further decreased GSK3β activity may then contribute to the synergistic β-catenin accumulation effect. Our results are also in agreement with the report by Cook et al. (24Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), in which they showed that the decreased GSK3β activity in 10T1/2 cells responding to Drosophila wingless was insensitive to wortmannin. It was proposed that a phorbol ester-sensitive PKC may be the signaling molecule to GSK3β in the Wnt pathway (24Cook D. Fry M.J. Hughes K. Sumathipala R. Woodgett J.R. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4526-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Certain isoforms of PKC are able to phosphorylate GSK3β in vitro (45Goode N. Hughes K. Woodgett J.R. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16878-16882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, PKC may not be the sole signaling molecule since inhibitors of PKC do not completely block Wnt effects (46Chen R.H. Ding W.V. McCormick F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17894-17899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Integrin-linked kinase is another kinase that was able to induce nuclear β-catenin accumulation (47Novak A. Hsu S.C. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Radeva G. Papkoff J. Montesano R. Roskelley C. Grosschedl R. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4374-4379Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), activate PKB in vivoand phosphorylate GSK3β in vitro (48Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). It is unclear whether GSK3β is regulated by phosphorylation during Wnt signaling. We were not able to detect any change in phosphorylation by in vivo labeling, phosphoamino acid analysis, and phosphopeptide mapping. Phosphorylation as a mode of regulating GSK3β in Wnt pathway cannot be ruled out although Ser-9 is not involved. Ruelet al. (25Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21790-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) observed an increased phosphorylation on serine residues of Drosophila GSK3 (shaggy) in inducible Wnt or Dsh cells. The hormone-inducible Dvl-ER cells we generated will be useful for revisiting this issue and also probing for other biological activities of Dsh/Dvl. In addition, there are two forms of GSK3 in mammalian cells, GSK3α and GSK3β. The role of GSK3α in Wnt signaling is worthy of future investigation. Specificity in signaling could be achieved by specific complex formation and subcellular translocation. Ras is an example of such regulation (49Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). At the focal point of a multitude of signals and mitogens, it has many downstream effectors. Ras interacts with different effectors via different groups of residues. Upon activation, Ras binds Raf and relocalizes Raf to the plasma membrane for further activation. GSK3β has been shown to form complexes with APC and axin-conductin (15Rubinfeld B. Albert I. Porfiri E. Fiol C. Munemitsu S. Polakis P. Science. 1996; 272: 1023-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W.

Fryer L.G. Hutchinson L. Fry M.J. Dale T.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2823-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Peptides derived from Frat1 specifically inhibit kinase activity of GSK3 on axin and β-catenin but not GS (51Thomas G.M. Frame S. Goedert M. Nathke I. Polakis P. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 1999; 458: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several groups suggested that Wnt signaling dissociated this complex (20Willert K. Shibamoto S. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1768-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4233-4240Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpressed casein kinase I was found to interact with Dsh and to mimic Wnt signaling (52Peters J.M. McKay R.M. McKay J.P. Graff J.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Are there different pools of GSK3β complexes in different signaling pathways? Several findings by us and others imply that GSK3β may not be limiting in cells. First, kinase-dead GSK3β mutants failed to elicit any effect on Wnt signaling in 293 or CHOIR cell lines based on the unaltered β-catenin-dependent luciferase activity (data not shown and 23). Although in Xenopus overexpression of kinase-dead GSK3β did cause axis duplication, mimicking activated Wnt signaling pathway (53He X. Saint-Jeannet J.P. Woodgett J.R. Varmus H.E. Dawid I.B. Nature. 1995; 374: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), this effect has not been observed consistently in mammalian cell systems. Second, in cells that contain high amounts of β-catenin, such as SW480 cell line or 293 cells overexpressing β-catenin, exogenous GSK3β was not able to decrease the level of β-catenin-dependent transcription, whereas axin-conductin or APC did so efficiently (data not shown and Ref. 16Behrens J. Jerchow B.A. Wurtele M. Grimm J. Asbrand C. Wirtz R. Kuhl M. Wedlich D. Birchmeier W. Science. 1998; 280: 596-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). It is not certain whether the levels of overexpression of GSK3β and axin-conductin are comparable. Nevertheless, one explanation is that GSK3 is not the limiting factor, thus supporting the idea that a subpopulation of GSK3β is dedicated to form complexes with axin-conductin and only this pool of GSK3β participates in Wnt signaling. Furthermore, we observed that the GSK3β complexed to transiently or stably expressed conductin was significantly protected from Ser-9 phosphorylation by insulin. Further analysis through the investigation of this complex will shed light on our understanding of how GSK3 is regulated in the Wnt signaling pathway. We thank Drs. W. Birchmeier, A. Brown, H.

Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 418-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In fact, AEA has been isolated and characterized as an endogenous ligand for cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system (CB1 subtype) and peripheral immune cells (CB2 subtype). AEA is released from depolarized neurons, endothelial cells and macrophages (2Di Marzo V. Bisogno T. De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Orlando P. Wagner J.A. Kunos G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 264: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and mimics the pharmacological effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, the active principle of hashish and marijuana (3Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Recently, attention has been focused on the possible role of AEA and other endocannabinoids in regulating cell growth and differentiation, which might account for some pathophysiological effects of these lipids. An anti-proliferative action of AEA has been reported in human breast carcinoma cells, due to a CB1-like receptor-mediated inhibition of the action of endogenous prolactin at its receptor (4De Petrocellis L. Melck D. Palmisano A. Bisogno T. Laezza C. Bifulco M. Di Marzo V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8375-8380Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). An activation of cell proliferation by AEA has been reported instead in hematopoietic cell lines (5Derocq J.-M. Bouaboula M. Marchand J. Rinaldi-Carmona M. Ségui M. Casellas P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, preliminary evidence that the immunosuppressive effects of AEA might be associated with inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and induction of programmed cell death (PCD or apoptosis) has been reported (6Schwarz H. Blanco F.J. Lotz M. J. Neuroimmunol. 1994; 55: 107-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and growing evidence is being collected that suggests that AEA might have pro-apoptotic activity, both in vitro (7Sarker K.P.

This would extend to endocannabinoids previous observations on Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol, shown to induce PCD in glioma tumors (8Galve-Roperh I. Sànchez C. Cortes M.L. del Pulgar T.G. Izquierdo M.

Recently, we showed that human neuroblastoma CHP100 cells and human lymphoma U937 cells do have these tools to eliminate AEA (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A.

Therefore, these cell lines were chosen to investigate how AEA and related endocannabinoids induce apoptosis and how the removal and degradation of AEA are related to this process. The existence of a neuroimmune axis appears to be confirmed by the finding that endocannabinoids elicit common responses in these two cell types. Chemicals were of the purest analytical grade. Anandamide (arachidonoylethanolamide, AEA), actinomycin D, cycloheximide, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), indomethacin, cytochrome c, cyclosporin A, andNω-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) were purchased from Sigma. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), arachidonoyltrifluoromethyl ketone (ATFMK) andN-(4-hydroxyphenyl)arachidonoylamide (AM404) were from Research Biochemicals International. EGTA-AM, capsaicin ([N-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)methyl]-8-methyl-6-nonenamide), capsazepine (N-[2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-2H-2-benzazepine-2-carbothioamide, Caps), caspase-3 inhibitor II (Z-Asp(OCH3)-Glu(OCH3)-Val-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone, Z-DEVD-FMK), and caspase-9 inhibitor I (Z-Leu-Glu(OCH3)-His-Asp(OCH3)-fluoromethyl ketone, Z-LEHD-FMK) were from Calbiochem. [3H]AEA (223 Ci/mmol) and [3H]CP55,940 (126 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products.N-Piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-pyrazolecarboxamide (SR141716) andN-[1(S)-endo-1,3,3-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-yl]-5-(4-chloro-3-methylphenyl)-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR144528) were a kind gift from Sanofi Recherche (Montpellier, France). Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), oleoylethanolamide (OEA), and linoleoylethanolamide (LEA) were synthesized and characterized (purity >96% by gas-liquid chromatography) as reported (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M.

Cannabidiol (CBD) was a kind gift from Dr. M. Van der Stelt (Utrecht University, The Netherlands). 5,5′,6,6′-Tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine iodide (JC-1) and 1-[2-amino-5-(2,7-dichloro-6-hydroxy-3-oxy-9-xanthenyl)-phenoxy]-2-[2-amino-5-methyl-phenoxy]ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-3 AM) were from Molecular Probes. Anti-cytochromec monoclonal antibodies (clone 7H8.2C12 and clone 6H2.B4) were purchased from PharMingen, and goat anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase conjugates (GAM-AP) were from Bio-Rad. Non-immune mouse serum was from Nordic Immunology (Tilburg, The Netherlands). Human neuroblastoma CHP100 cells were cultured as reported (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), in a 1:1 mixture of Eagle's minimal essential medium plus Earle's salts and Ham's F-12 media (Flow Laboratories Ltd., Ayrshire, Scotland, UK), supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, sodium bicarbonate (1.2 g/l), 15 mm Hepes buffer, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1% non-essential amino acids. Human lymphoma U937 and leukemia DAUDI cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M.

Rat C6 glioma cells, a kind gift from Dr. Dale G. Deutsch (Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, State University of New York, Stony Brook), were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum as described (9Sànchez C. Galve-Roperh I. Canova C. Brachet P. Guzmàn M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and were fed every 3–4 days. Before each treatment, cells were washed twice with sterile, Ca2+ and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then they were resuspended in sterile PBS at a concentration of 106cells/ml. Cell suspensions were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations (up to 10 μm) of endocannabinoids dissolved in methanol, and they were then resuspended in their culture media for the indicated periods. Control cells were incubated with the same volumes of vehicle alone (up to 10 μl/ml PBS). The interference of various compounds with the effects of AEA was assessed by incubating together CHP100 or U937 cells with each substance and AEA. Electrotransfer of anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies (clone 6H2.B4, which recognizes the native form of cytochromec; 200 μg/test) into U937 cells (106cells/test) was performed with a Gene Pulser II Plus apparatus (Bio-Rad). Exponentially decaying pulses were generated and delivered to cells suspended in PBS (0.7 ml/test) in sterile disposable electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) of 0.4-cm path length (16Maccarrone M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). U937 cells were electroporated at a capacitance of 125 microfarads and a field strength of 800 V/cm, with a time constant (τ) of 1.5 ± 0.2 ms. Control cells were electroporated under the same experimental conditions, in the presence of non-immune mouse serum (200 μg/test). After electroporation, cells were kept for 5 min at 4 °C, and they were then washed twice in PBS and treated with AEA as described for the non-electroporated cells. Under these experimental conditions, approximately 1.0 pg/cell (2.5 μg/mg protein) of monoclonal antibodies was incorporated (16Maccarrone M. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). After incubation for the indicated periods in culture medium, floating and enzymatically detached cells were collected together by centrifugation at 200 × gfor 5 min. Viability was estimated by trypan blue dye exclusion in a Neubauer hemocytometer. Apoptosis was estimated in all experiments by cytofluorimetric analysis in a FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson), which quantified apoptotic body formation in dead cells by staining with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml, pretreated also with RNase to reduce noise), as reported (17Maccarrone M. Catani M.V. Finazzi-Agrò A. Melino G. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed using a methanol:acetone (4:1 v/v) solution, 1:1 in PBS, at −20 °C, and were stored at 4 °C. Cells were excited at 488 nm using a 15-milliwatt argon laser, and the fluorescence was monitored at 570 nm. Events were triggered by the FSC signal and gated for FL2-A/FL2-W to skip aggregates. Ten thousand events were evaluated using the Cell Quest Program. Controls of different cell lines contained less than 4.0 ± 1.0 apoptotic bodies every 100 cells analyzed. PCD was evaluated also by the cell-death detection ELISA kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), based on the evaluation of DNA fragmentation by an immunoassay for histone-associated DNA fragments in the cell cytoplasm (18Maccarrone M. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Dullens H.F.J. Catani M.V. Melino G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The uptake of [3H]AEA by intact C6 or DAUDI cells was studied as described (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in the respective serum-free culture media, at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml. Cell suspensions (1 ml/test) were incubated for different time intervals, at 37 °C, with 200 nm [3H]AEA; then they were washed three times in 2 ml of culture medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and were finally resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Membrane lipids were then extracted (18Maccarrone M. Nieuwenhuizen W.F. Dullens H.F.J. Catani M.V. Melino G. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), resuspended in 0.5 ml of methanol, and mixed with 3.5 ml of Sigma-Fluor liquid scintillation mixture for non-aqueous samples (Sigma), and radioactivity was measured in a LKB1214 Rackbeta scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). To discriminate noncarrier-mediated from carrier-mediated transport of AEA into cell membranes, control experiments were made at 4 °C (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Incubations (15 min) were also carried out with different concentrations of [3H]AEA, in the range 0–1000 nm, in order to determine apparent K m andV max of the uptake by Lineweaver-Burk analysis (in this case, the uptake at 4 °C was subtracted from that at 37 °C). AEA uptake was expressed as picomoles of AEA taken up per min per mg of protein. Fatty acid amide hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.4; FAAH) activity was assayed in C6 or DAUDI cell extracts by measuring the release of [3H]arachidonic acid from [3H]AEA, using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography as reported (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). FAAH activity was expressed as picomoles of arachidonate released per min per mg of protein. Kinetic studies were performed using different concentrations of [3H]AEA (in the range 0–25 μm), and the kinetic constants (K m,V max) were calculated by fitting the experimental points in a Lineweaver-Burk plot with a linear regression program (Kaleidagraph 3.0.4). Straight lines with r values >0.95 were obtained. CHP100, U973, C6, or DAUDI cells (2 × 108) were pelleted and resuspended in 8 ml of buffer A (2 mm Tris-EDTA, 320 mmsucrose, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) and then were homogenized in a Potter homogenizer and centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 10 min (19Maccarrone M. Fiorucci L. Erba F. Bari M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Ascoli F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The supernatant was recovered and combined with the supernatants obtained from two subsequent centrifugations at 1000 × g of the pellet. Combined supernatant fractions were centrifuged at 40000 × gfor 30 min, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in assay buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mm Tris-EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4), to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml (19Maccarrone M. Fiorucci L. Erba F. Bari M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Ascoli F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The membrane preparation was divided in aliquots, quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for no longer than 1 week. These membrane fractions, as well as those prepared from the brain of Wistar rats (male, weighting 250–280 g), were used in rapid filtration assays with the synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP55,940, as described previously (19Maccarrone M. Fiorucci L. Erba F. Bari M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Ascoli F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Data of displacement of 400 pm [3H]CP 55,940 by various concentrations of AEA (in the range 10−12 to 10−6m) were elaborated by the GraphPad program (GraphPad Software for Science), calculating the inhibition constant (K i) as reported (20Deutsch D.G. Goligorsky M.S. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Arreaza G. Thorup C. Stefano G. Moore L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Unspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm AEA (19Maccarrone M. Fiorucci L. Erba F. Bari M. Finazzi-Agrò A. Ascoli F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Deutsch D.G. Goligorsky M.S. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Arreaza G. Thorup C. Stefano G. Moore L.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1538-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Binding of [3H]AEA to cells was assessed using the same membrane preparations and the same filtration assays as those described above for the cannabinoid receptors binding. Mitochondrial uncoupling and intracellular calcium concentration were evaluated by flow cytometric analysis in a FACScalibur Flow Cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Mitochondrial uncoupling was measured using the fluorescent probe JC-1, as described (21Smiley S.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3671-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). JC-1 (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was used at 20 μm final concentration. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone (1% of the final volume). After the treatment, CHP100 or U937 cells were washed in PBS and incubated 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were then analyzed in a FL1/FL2 dot plot (530 nm/570 nm), gating on morphologically normal cells. Cytoplasmic free calcium was measured using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fluo-3 AM, as reported (22Vandenberghe P.A. Ceuppens J.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 127: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). CHP100 or U937 cells were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free PBS. Then, Fluo-3 AM (10 μm dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) was added, and cells were incubated 40 min at 37 °C in the dark and frequently shaken manually. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone (1% of the final volume). Cells were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in culture medium without fetal bovine serum. Fluo-3 AM fluorescence was recorded on a linear scale at 530 nm (bandwidth 30 nm), at a flow rate of approximately 1000 cells/s. Mean fluorescence values for 3000 events were registered every 10 s. Changes in mean fluorescence were plotted versus time. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%) under reducing conditions and electroblotting onto 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad) were performed on cell extracts (25 μg/lane), prepared as reported (23Ushmorov A. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Dröge W. Schirrmacher V. Umansky V. Blood. 1999; 93: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prestained molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) were carbonic anhydrase (37 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (27 kDa), and lysozyme (19 kDa). Immunodetection of cytochrome c on nitrocellulose filters was performed with specific anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies (clone 7H8.2C12, which recognizes the denatured form of cytochrome c), diluted 1:250. Goat anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (GAM-AP) were used as secondary antibody at 1:2000 dilution. The amount of cytochromec released into the cytosol of CHP100 or U937 cells 8 h after treatment (23Ushmorov A. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Dröge W. Schirrmacher V. Umansky V. Blood. 1999; 93: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Cell extracts (25 μg/well) were prepared as reported (23Ushmorov A. Ratter F. Lehmann V. Dröge W. Schirrmacher V. Umansky V. Blood. 1999; 93: 2342-2352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and were reacted with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibodies (clone 7H8.2C12), diluted 1:250. GAM-AP were used as secondary antibody at 1:2000 dilution. Color development of the alkaline phosphatase reaction was recorded at 405 nm, usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (15Maccarrone M. van der Stelt M. Rossi A. Veldink G.A. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32332-32339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The absorbance values of the unknown samples were within the linearity range of the ELISA test, assessed by calibration curves with known amounts of cytochrome c (in the range 0–500 ng/well). Data reported in this paper are the mean (±S.D.) of at least three independent determinations, each in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed by the Student'st test, elaborating experimental data by means of the InStat program (GraphPad Software for Science). Treatment of human neuroblastoma CHP100 cells and human lymphoma U937 cells with AEA led to apoptotic body formation in a dose- (Fig.1 A) and time- (Fig.1 B) dependent manner. Detection by ELISA of DNA fragments in the cell cytosols under the same experimental conditions confirmed the cytofluorimetric data (Fig. 1 C). Apoptosis at 48 h was significant in both cell lines already at 0.25 μm AEA (approximately 2.5-fold over the control) and reached a level of 6.0-fold over the control at 1 μm AEA (Fig.1 A). These concentrations are in the physiological range (24Di Marzo V. Sepe N. De Petrocellis L. Berger A. Crozier G. Fride E. Mechoulam R. Nature. 1998; 396: 636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Time course experiments showed that 1 μm AEA induced a significant increase in apoptotic bodies 24 h after treatment (2.5-fold over the control) and a maximum of 6-fold the control after 48 h (Fig. 1 B). Unlike AEA, 2-AG and other endocannabinoids failed to induce significant cell death in CHP100 or U937 cells (Table I).Table IEffect of AEA analogues on apoptotic body formation, mitochondrial uncoupling and intracellular calcium concentration in CHP100 cellsCompound (1 μm)Apoptotic bodiesMitochondrial uncouplingIntracellular calcium-fold over control-fold over control-fold over controlNone1.01.01.02-AG1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.LEA1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.3 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.OEA1.3 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.3 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.2 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.PEA1.4 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.2 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.1.3 ± 0.2 1-ap > 0.05 compared with control.Values refer to measurements performed 48 h (apoptotic bodies), 6 h (mitochondrial uncoupling), or 6 min (intracellular calcium) after the addition of each compound.

Open table in a new tab Values refer to measurements performed 48 h (apoptotic bodies), 6 h (mitochondrial uncoupling), or 6 min (intracellular calcium) after the addition of each compound. In all analyses, U937 cells showed results superimposable to those obtained with CHP100 cells, omitted for the sake of clarity. In order to investigate the possible role of cannabinoid receptors on PCD induced in CHP100 or U937 cells by AEA, two specific CBR antagonists were used as follows: SR141716 and SR144528, which bind CB1R and CB2R, respectively (3Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). Neither SR141716 nor SR144528, even if used at an excess concentration of 5 μm, could significantly prevent the AEA-induced toxicity, suggesting that the effect was not mediated by “classical” CB1 or CB2 receptors (TableII). In line with these data, the synthetic cannabinoid [3H]CP55.940, a high affinity ligand for both CB1 and CB2 receptors (3Pertwee R.G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 74: 129-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), did not bind to human neuroblastoma or lymphoma cells, suggesting that they had no functional cannabinoid receptors on their surface (Fig.2). Instead rat brain, used as a positive control, did bind [3H]CP55.940, which was displaced by AEA (Fig. 2, inset) with an inhibition constant (K i = 30 ± 4 nm) close to that previously reported (20Deutsch D.G. Goligorsky M.S. Schmid P.C. Krebsbach R.J. Schmid H.H.O. Das S.K. Dey S.K. Arreaza G. Thorup C. Stefano G. Moore L.C. J. Clin.

On the other hand, actinomycin D and cycloheximide (both at 10 μg/ml) reduced AEA-induced PCD in CHP100 cells down to approximately 20 or 30% of the control, respectively (Table II). Superimposable results were observed with the human lymphoma U937 cell line (Table II).Table"
https://openalex.org/W1980927246,"Nucleotides are important extracellular signaling molecules. At least five mammalian P2Y receptors exist that are specifically activated by ATP, UTP, ADP, or UDP. Although the existence of ectoenzymes that metabolize extracellular nucleotides is well established, the relative flux of ATP and UTP through their extracellular metabolic products remains undefined. Therefore, we have studied the kinetics of accumulation and metabolism of endogenous ATP in the extracellular medium of four different cell lines. ATP concentrations reached a maximum immediately after change of medium and decreased thereafter with a single exponential decay (t½;1 ∼;230–40 min). ATP levels did not fall to zero but attained a base-line concentration that was independent of the medium volume and of the initial ATP concentration. Although the base-line concentration of ATP remained stable for up to 12 h, [γ-32P]ATP added to resting cells as a radiotracer was completely degraded within 120 min, indicating that steady state reflected a basal rate of ATP release balanced by ATP hydrolysis (20–200 fmol × min−1 × cell−6). High performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that the γ-phosphate of ATP was rapidly, although transiently, transferred during steady state to species subsequently identified as UTP and GTP, indicating the existence of both ecto-nucleoside diphosphokinase activity and the accumulation of endogenous UDP and GDP. Conversely, addition of [γ-32P]UTP to resting cells resulted in transient formation of [γ-32P]ATP, indicating phosphorylation of endogenous ADP by nucleoside diphosphokinase. The final32P-products of [γ-32P]ATP metabolism were [32P]orthophosphoric acid and a 32P-labeled species that was further purified and identified as [32P]inorganic pyrophosphate. In C6 cells, the formation of [32P]pyrophosphate from [γ-32P]ATP at steady state exceeded by 3-fold that of [32P]orthophosphate. These results illustrate for the first time a constitutive release of ATP and other nucleotides and reveal the existence of a complex extracellular metabolic pathway for released nucleotides. In addition to the existence of an ecto-ATPase activity, our results suggest a major scavenger role of ecto-ATP pyrophosphatase and a transphosphorylating activity of nucleoside diphosphokinase.

In addition to the existence of an ecto-ATPase activity, our results suggest a major scavenger role of ecto-ATP pyrophosphatase and a transphosphorylating activity of nucleoside diphosphokinase. minimal essential medium inorganic pyrophosphate adenylyl imidodiphosphate β,γ-methylene ATP β-metATP, α,β-methylene ATP nucleoside diphosphokinase P1–P4-di(adenosine-5′) tetraphosphate P1–P5-di(adenosine-5′) tetraphosphate high performance liquid chromatography tetrabutylethyl ammonium sulfate ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase Extracellular nucleotides regulate a broad range of cellular responses such as platelet aggregation, vascular tone, cell proliferation, mucociliary clearance, cardiac and skeletal muscle contraction, and neurotransmission (1Burnstock G.

Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 39: 337-352Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, the relative functional importance of these different enzymatic activities has not been defined for a given cell type, and little understanding is available of how these enzymes work in concert to produce the final pattern of metabolism of nucleotides. This is an important question given the aforementioned different selectivities of activation of P2Y receptors by both di- and triphosphate adenine and uridine nucleotides. As such, we have studied the kinetics of accumulation and metabolism of endogenous ATP in the extracellular medium of several different cell types. Our results illustrate for the first time a “constitutive” release of nucleotide that balances nucleotide hydrolysis and accounts for resting levels of extracellular nucleotides. We establish that the exchange of the γ-phosphate between adenine and uridine nucleotides at steady state markedly exceeds the ecto-ATPase activity. Moreover, our results highlight the importance of a nucleotide pyrophosphatase activity and reveal that this activity approaches or exceeds that of the ecto-ATPase. C6 rat glioma, 1321N1 human astrocytoma, and 16HBE14o− human bronchial epithelial cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-H containing 5% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics as described previously (23Lazarowski E.R.

All cultures were grown to confluence on 24-well plastic plates (Costar). Prior to assays, the cultures were washed three times and incubated in 0.5 ml of serum- and phenol red-free minimum essential medium (MEM).2 Samples of extracellular medium were collected and boiled for 1 min, and the luciferin-luciferase assay was performed using a LB953 AutoLumat luminometer (Berthold GmbH), as described previously (21Watt W.C.

Standard curves were performed routinely using molecular biology grade ATP, which was diluted in the same buffer and processed (e.g. boiled) in parallel to cell samples. No loss of ATP was observed during sample boiling. The threshold value for ATP detection was 100 pm (5 fmol/sample), and luminescence was linear with ATP concentration to 1000 nm. 32P-Labeled inorganic pyrophosphate (32PPi) was obtained by incubating 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (100 μm) with 2 units/ml commercial nucleotide pyrophosphatase at 30 °C for 5 min. The quantitative conversion of [γ-32P]ATP to32PPi plus AMP was monitored by HPLC.

Extracellular levels of ATP did not fall to zero but attained a base line in the low nanomolar range within 3 h and remained unchanged for up to 12 h (Fig. 1 and TableI).Table IATP decay to steady statet 12k[ATP]blνhydrolysisper 106 cellsper cm−2minmin −1nmfmol/min16HBE14o−290.0231.9 ± 0.414517.3ECV-304290.0232.4 ± 0.620420.1C6320.0221.1 ± 0.2249.41321N1410.0174.9 ± 0.916632.6The t 12 values and first order rate constants (k) of ATP decay were obtained from the experiments described in Fig. 1 using a non-linear regression fit for single exponential decay (SigmaPlot, Jandel Corp.).

Open table in a new tab The t 12 values and first order rate constants (k) of ATP decay were obtained from the experiments described in Fig. 1 using a non-linear regression fit for single exponential decay (SigmaPlot, Jandel Corp.). Baseline ATP concentration ([ATP]bl) is expressed as the mean ± S.D. from 4-h incubation samples obtained from three experiments performed in quadruplicate. The hypothetical rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady state (νhydrolysis) was calculated as ν = k[ATP]bl. The dependence of the ATP concentration at base line on both the volume of the extracellular medium and the magnitude of the initial concentration of ATP was determined. The concentration of ATP 1 min subsequent to a wash was 132 ± 19 nm(n = 6) for ECV-304 cells incubated in 0.5 ml of bathing solution. Addition of 1 ml of mineral oil to the post-wash aqueous medium of these cells resulted in a slight increase of the ATP concentration within 1 min (152 ± 25 nm,n = 6), possibly reflecting additional ATP release due to the higher hydrostatic pressure and/or medium stirring. Addition of 1 ml of aqueous medium instead of mineral oil (i.e. the final volume of aqueous medium was 1.5 ml) resulted in a decrease in ATP concentration to 46 ± 7 nm (measured at 1 min,n = 6), consistent with the 1:3 dilution of the initial solution. ATP concentrations further decayed to base-line levels that were similar in non-diluted (0.5 ml of medium: 3.2 ± 1 nm, n = 6) and 1:3 diluted samples (1.5 ml of medium: 2.6 ± 0.4 nm, n = 6). In the four cell lines, addition of exogenous ATP (30 and 300 nm) to resting cells incubated in 0.5 ml of MEM resulted with time in base-line ATP concentrations that were indistinguishable from base-line values of control cells (shown in Table I). Thet 12 values for hydrolysis of exogenous ATP (data not shown) at both 30 and 300 nm were identical to thet 12 values for endogenous ATP shown in Table I. These results indicate that extracellular ATP concentrations attain a constant value that is independent of the volume of the bathing medium and of the magnitude of the initial ATP concentration. We further examined the capacity of 16HBE14o−, ECV-304, C6, and 1321N1 cells to metabolize exogenous [γ-32P]ATP added after ATP concentrations stabilized. Cells were maintained undisturbed for at least 3 h, [γ-32P]ATP then was added at high specific radioactivity, and both the ATP concentration and [γ-32P]ATP were quantified by the luciferin-luciferase assay and HPLC analysis, respectively. Although levels of ATP mass remained unchanged, [γ-32P]ATP was near completely metabolized within 120 min (Fig. 2). Thus, the development of a base-line ATP concentration reflects a steady state where hydrolysis is balanced by basal (“constitutive”) release of ATP. Consequently, resting cells release ATP at a rate that can be quantitatively deduced from the rate of ATP hydrolysis at steady state. The simplest approach to determine the rate of ATP release at steady state would be to measure directly the initial rate of [γ-32P]ATP decay or, alternatively, the rate of accumulation of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (32Pi). However, disappearance of [γ-32P]ATP does not necessarily represent hydrolysis since occurrence of enzyme-catalyzed exchange of the γ-phosphate between ATP and co-released nucleotides (without involving32Pi release) may substantially affect the first segment of the [γ-32P]ATP decay curve. Moreover,32Pi was not the sole end-product of [γ-32P]ATP metabolism (see below). The rates of ATP hydrolysis at steady state were deduced by kinetic analysis calculating the first order rate constant k of ATP decay (k = 0.693/t 12, Table I) and using the ATP concentrations measured at steady state (νhydrolysis = k [ATP]). The νhydrolysis values obtained ranged from ∼20 to 200 fmol/min × 10−6 cells within the four cell lines studied (Table I). HPLC analysis of the products of [γ-32P]ATP metabolism (Fig.3) revealed that, in addition to32Pi, two other 32P-species appeared in the extracellular medium, with retention times of 8 and 18 min (hereafter referred to as 32P-8 and 32P-18, respectively). The 32P-18 species arose soon after addition of [γ-32P]ATP and subsequently decreased in parallel with the decrease of [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.4). The 32P-8 species accumulated more slowly but steadily in the medium of 16HBE14o− cells, ECV-304 cells, and 1321N1 cells. Accumulation of 32P-8 was greater than accumulation of32Pi in the medium of C6 rat glioma cells (Figs. 3 and 4).Figure 4Time course of extracellular [γ-32P]ATP metabolism.[γ-32P]ATP was added to resting cells for the indicated times and the resulting 32P-species analyzed by HPLC.

The formation of 32P-8 and 32Pi was dependent on the presence of cells. In contrast, the 32P-18 species was generated by adding [γ-32P]ATP to the cell-free conditioned medium (Fig. 5). Similar results were observed with ECV-304 and 16HBE14o− cells (data not shown). The 32P-18 species, which co-eluted with authentic standards of GTP and UTP (Fig.6 A), was sensitive (as was [γ-32P]ATP) to acid phosphatase, but the32P-8 species was not (Fig. 6 B). The32P-8 species, which co-eluted with authentic32PPi, was hydrolyzed by inorganic pyrophosphatase, but 32P-18 and [γ-32P]ATP were not (Fig. 6 C). Incubation of the32P-species containing-samples with C. adamateusnucleotide-pyrophosphatase (EC 3.6.1.9) resulted in conversion of both32P-18 and [γ-32P]ATP into a32P-species that co-eluted with 32P-8 (Fig.6 D). Therefore, 32P-18 was tentatively identified as [32P]UTP/[32P]GTP, and32P-8 as 32PPi. These results suggest the presence of extracellular nucleoside diphosphokinase (NDPK) and ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase (E-NPP) activities. We previously reported the existence of an ecto-NDPK activity in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells (29Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20402-20407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Unambiguous proof for NDPK-mediated formation of the32P-18 species by 16HBE14o−, ECV-304, and C6 cells was obtained by three approaches. First, addition of a molar excess of UDP (100 μm) to cells that were pre-incubated with [γ-32P]ATP for 30 min resulted in further conversion of [32P]ATP to [32P]UTP within 5 min (with no visible changes in the earlier 32P-species; Fig. 7 B). Similarly, addition of 100 μm CDP resulted in a shift of the radioactivity from both [γ-32P]ATP and 32P-18 to [γ-32P]CTP (Fig. 7 C), and addition of 100 μm ADP resulted in reversion of 32P-18 back to [γ-32P]ATP (data not shown). Second, cell-free conditioned medium was deproteinized with trichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid was removed by ethyl ether extraction, and the solutions neutralized (pH 7.4) and incubated for 10 min with [γ-32P]ATP (3 nm) in the absence or presence of 0.05 units/ml bovine liver NDPK. No changes in [γ-32P] ATP were observed in the absence of NDPK, confirming that no endogenous activity was present after the trichloroacetic acid extraction. Inclusion of NDPK during incubation resulted in partial conversion of [γ-32P]ATP to32P-18 (Fig. 7 D). Thus, the endogenous transphosphorylating activity that promotes formation of the32P-18 species in the cell-bathing medium could be substituted by exogenous NDPK added to the deproteinized solutions. Third, the32P-18 species that co-elute as UTP and GTP on the C18 column (Fig. 7 E) were resolved as [32P]UTP (∼45%) and [32P]GTP (55%), respectively, by an ion chromatography column (Fig. 7 F). These findings indicate that endogenous GDP and UDP accumulate in the extracellular medium and serve as acceptor substrates of NDPK. This notion also applies for ADP, as is shown below. The 32P-8 species was purified from C6 cell medium by HPLC (Fig.8, A and B) and positively identified as 32PPi by incubating the purified fraction with 2 units/ml UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and a molar excess of UDP-glucose. Consistent with the reaction: PPi + UDP-glucose → UTP + glucose-1P (23Lazarowski E.R. Ha"

Because microtubule inhibitors activate JNK, we sought to determine whether JNK was responsible for Bcl-2/Bcl-XL phosphorylation in KB-3 cells treated with vinblastine. Two major endogenous forms of JNK, p46JNK1 and p54JNK2, were present in KB-3 cells, and both isoforms were activated by vinblastine as determined by Mono Q chromatography. We used antisense oligonucleotides (AS) to specifically inhibit their expression. A combination of AS-JNK1 with AS-JNK2 inhibited by 80% vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of two known JNK substrates, c-Jun and ATF-2. In addition, AS-JNK1/2 inhibited vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 by 85% and that of Bcl-XL by 65%. Stable expression of the JNK scaffold protein JIP-1 blocked vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, but did not affect Bcl-2/Bcl-XL phosphorylation, confirming a bifurcation in JNK signaling involving both nuclear and non-nuclear substrates. Vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Raf-1 was unaffected by AS-JNK1/2 and was associated with loss of activity for MEK substrate in vitro and inactivation of ERK in vivo. These results provide evidence for a direct role of the JNK pathway in apoptotic regulation through Bcl-2/Bcl-XLphosphorylation.

Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 78-165Google Scholar). The cellular effects of vinblastine are mediated primarily by binding to tubulin subunits, inhibiting tubulin polymerization and leading to disruption of microtubule dynamics. Like other microtubule inhibitors such as paclitaxel, the effects of vinblastine are concentration-dependent. Very low concentrations in the subnanomolar range can cause growth inhibition without mitotic arrest, whereas very high concentrations in the 1–100 μm range cause nonspecific immediate effects in non-proliferating as well as proliferating cells. At clinically relevant concentrations (5–500 nm range), the cytotoxicity of vinblastine appears to be associated with G2/M phase arrest, followed by apoptotic cell death (1Rowinsky E.K. Donehower R.C. Perry M.C. The Chemotherapy Source Book. Williams & Wilkins Co., Baltimore1998: 387-423Google Scholar, 2Haskell C.M. Haskell C.M. Cancer Treatment. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia1995: 78-165Google Scholar). The signaling pathways responsible for promoting cell death in response to microtubule inhibitors are under intense investigation. As first shown for paclitaxel (3Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar), a common feature of microtubule inhibitors is to stimulate phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (4Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation occurs in an unstructured loop and involves several sites, the principal ones being Ser70 and Ser87 (reviewed in Ref. 5Fojo T. Blagosklonny M.V. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 83: 151-156PubMed Google Scholar). Uncertainty still exists whether phosphorylation increases or decreases the anti-apoptotic function of Bcl-2. Most data support the original hypothesis (3Haldar S. Jena N. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar) and suggest that phosphorylation inactivates Bcl-2, thus promoting apoptosis, possibly by freeing Bax from Bcl-2/Bax dimers (6Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has also been presented that Bcl-2 phosphorylation is associated with normal mitotic progression (7Ling Y.H. Tornos C. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18984-18991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Scatena C.D. Stewart Z.A. Mays D. Tang L.J. Keefer C.J. Leach S.D.

The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 relative, Bcl-XL, also undergoes phosphorylation in response to microtubule inhibition (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of this modification remain to be established. Because of the universal nature of Bcl-2 phosphorylation and its potential role in apoptotic and mitotic regulation, interest has focused on the specific signal transduction pathways and protein kinases involved. Bcl-2 phosphorylation in response to microtubule inhibitors occurs concurrently with hyperphosphorylation and apparent activation of Raf-1 (4Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 10Blagosklonny M.V. Schulte T.W. Nguyen P. Mimnaugh E.G. Trepel J. Neckers L. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4623-4626PubMed Google Scholar). However, Raf-1 does not appear to directly phosphorylate Bcl-2 (11Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Other kinases implicated in Bcl-2 phosphorylation include Cdc2/cyclin B1, cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs).1 Bcl-2 is not an in vitro substrate of Cdc2 and does not co-immunoprecipitate with Cdc2-cyclin B1 complexes (8Scatena C.D.

One report described stimulation of Bcl-2 phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (12Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nesterova M., C.C. Yoon S. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), but other studies have failed to demonstrate Bcl-2 phosphorylation following cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation (13Blagosklonny M.V. Chuman Y. Bergan R.C. Fojo T. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Among MAPKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) has been shown to phosphorylate Bcl-2 in COS-7 cells in the presence of constitutively active Rac1 (14Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25238-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). However, other reports have suggested that JNK is not involved in Bcl-2 phosphorylation induced by microtubule inhibitors. For example, JNK activation following microtubule inhibition can occur much earlier than Bcl-2 phosphorylation (15Attalla H. Westberg J.A. Andersson L.C. Adlercreutz H. Makela T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 616-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 16Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S. Fojo T. Wimalasena J. J. Biol.

Chuman Y. Bergan R.C. Fojo T. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); and inhibition of JNK by dominant-negative proteins did not affect paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation (17Wang T.H. Popp D.M. Wang H.S. Saitoh M. Mural J.G. Henley D.C. Ichijo H. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8208-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). No evidence currently exists on the sites of phosphorylation or kinases involved in Bcl-XLphosphorylation in response to microtubule inhibition, although JNK has been implicated in Bcl-XL phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation (18Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We originally demonstrated JNK activation by vinblastine (19Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and extended this observation to show that microtubule inhibitors activate components of the JNK pathway while inactivating ERK and p38 in KB-3 cells (20Stone A.A. Chambers T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine whether JNK is responsible for vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. To achieve this goal, we inhibited the expression of JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms by using highly specific phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides. The antisense oligonucleotides specifically and effectively depleted JNK isoform expression and in combination inhibited JNK-mediated phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun and ATF-2 in intact cells treated with vinblastine. In addition, the antisense oligonucleotides very effectively inhibited vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and also inhibited Bcl-XLphosphorylation. Moreover, we have found that the characteristic hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1 that occurs in response to vinblastine corresponds not to activation, but rather to inactivation of Raf-1 enzymatic activity for MEK1. These results suggest that a JNK-dependent pathway regulates vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, which occurs in parallel with inactivation of Raf-1/MEK/ERK. Antibodies to JNK1, JNK2, ERK1/2, Raf-1, and Bcl-2 and the GST-c-Jun-(1–79) fusion protein substrate were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and antibody to Bcl-XL was from Transduction Laboratories. Phospho-specific polyclonal antibodies to ERK, c-Jun, and AFT-2 were obtained from New England Biolabs, Inc., and antibody to T7 tag was from Novagen. GST-MEK1(K97A)-agarose beads were from Stressgen Biotech Corp. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone Laboratories, and other cell culture reagents were from Life Technologies, Inc. Unless otherwise stated, other reagents were from Sigma. The KB-3 human carcinoma cell line was maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Whole cell and nuclear extracts were prepared, and immunoblotting was performed as described previously (20Stone A.A. Chambers T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts used for JNK and Raf-1 activities and for immunoblotting were prepared by suspending cells in 0.25 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.1 μm okadaic acid, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). After 20 min on ice, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation for 20 min at 100,000 ×g. Quantitation of protein expression from immunoblots was performed with a MultiImager densitometry system (Bio-Rad) with background values subtracted in all cases. Treatment of cell extracts with acid phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was carried out as described previously (20Stone A.A. Chambers T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). JNK activity was measured by immunocomplex assay with anti-JNK1 antibody (sc-474) and GST-c-Jun-(1–79) as substrate as described (19Osborn M.T. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30950-30955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Raf-1 kinase was also measured by immunocomplex assay in a similar fashion, except that 10 μl of anti-Raf-1 antibody was used for immunoprecipitation, and 2 μg of kinase-inactive GST-MEK1(K97A) was used as substrate. For assay of JNK activity in FPLC column fractions, 13 μl of sample was incubated in a final volume of 25 μl containing 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP (15,000 cpm/pmol), and 5 μg of GST-c-Jun-(1–79). After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, reactions were terminated by addition of SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Quantitation was performed by phosphorimage analysis using a Model 445SI PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Whole cell extracts (2 mg) were subjected to FPLC on a Mono Q HR10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 mm Na3VO4, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.8 m, 16 ml) in the same buffer, and fractions of 0.4 ml were collected. Fractions were assayed for JNK activity as described above. The JNK phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides used in this study, each with 2′-O-methoxyethylphosphodiester residues as an additional modification, were synthesized and kindly provided by ISIS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Carlsbad, CA), and have been described previously (21Potapova O. Gorospe M. Dougherty R.H. Dean N.M. Gaarde W.A. Holbrook N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1713-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The specific antisense oligonucleotides used in this study were as follows: antisense JNK1 (AS-JNK1; ISIS 20572), 5′-CTC TCT GTA GGC CCG CTT GG-3′; and antisense JNK2 (AS-JNK2; ISIS 20571), 5′-GTC CGG GCC AGG CCA AAG TC-3′. Control oligonucleotides consisted of the scrambled (Scr) version of each antisense sequence as follows: Scr-JNK1 (ISIS 20567), 5′-CTT TCC GTT GGA CCC CTG GG-3′; and Scr-JNK2 (ISIS 20569), 5′-GTG CGC GCG AGC CCG AAA TC-3′. The oligonucleotides were added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in the presence of Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) using 2 μl of Lipofectin/ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/100 nmoligonucleotide. After vigorous shaking, the preparation was added to 70% confluent cells in 25-cm2 flasks. After 4.5 h, the transfection medium was replaced with complete growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and cells were harvested 60 h later or as indicated. For vinblastine-treated cultures, the drug was added 16 h prior to cell harvest for a period of 1 h, followed by 15 h in drug-free medium. Transfection of 106 KB-3 cells with 10 μg of pcDNA-T7-JIP-1 (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J.

Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin for 2 weeks, and drug-resistant colonies were chosen and maintained in growth medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin. The expression of JIP-1 in the transfectant clones was detected by immunoblotting with anti-T7 tag antibody. Vinblastine and other microtubule inhibitors, which induce G2/M arrest and apoptosis in many cell types, have been shown to activate JNK (16Wang T.H. Wang H.S. Ichijo H. Giannakakou P. Foster J.S.

A. 1995; 92: 4507-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 4Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar) and Bcl-XL (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we used an antisense oligonucleotide approach to determine whether JNK is responsible for vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of these Bcl-2 family proteins. Using a standard immunocomplex assay (20Stone A.A. Chambers T.C. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), control KB-3 cells exhibited barely detectable JNK activity, whereas cells treated with vinblastine had readily detectable JNK activity (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether vinblastine differentially activated JNK isoforms in KB-3 cells, we subjected cell extracts from treated cells to fractionation on a Mono Q column as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Two peaks of JNK activity were resolved upon elution with a salt gradient (Fig. 1 B). Aliquots of fractions encompassing both peaks were subjected to immunoblotting with anti-JNK1 polyclonal antibody (sc-474) and anti-JNK2 monoclonal antibody (sc-7345) (Fig.1 C). The anti-JNK1 antibody recognized proteins of 46 kDa (major) and 54 kDa (minor) in the first peak, whereas the anti-JNK2 antibody failed to recognize any protein in peak 1. Conversely, JNK2 immunoreactivity (at 54 kDa) was observed across peak 2. A chromatographically distinct form of p46JNK1contributes to the leading edge of peak 2. These results indicate that both major forms of JNK in KB-3 cells, namely p46JNK1 and p54JNK2, are activated by vinblastine. To determine whether we could specifically inhibit JNK isoform expression, we used antisense oligonucleotides directed toward JNK1 and JNK2. Cells were transfected for 4.5 h with JNK1 or JNK2 antisense oligonucleotides or the corresponding scrambled oligonucleotides in the presence of Lipofectin as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Treatment with AS-JNK1 or AS-JNK2 led to reduced expression of the corresponding JNK isoforms in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A), which was maximal 60–68 h after removal of the oligonucleotides (data not shown). In addition, AS-JNK1 specifically inhibited the expression of JNK1, but did not affect the expression of JNK2, p38, or ERK; and likewise, AS-JNK2 showed strict specificity (Fig. 2 B). Scrambled oligonucleotides were without effect. Because JNK1 and JNK2 often play redundant roles, and both were activated by vinblastine, we investigated whether we could simultaneously inhibit their expression. As shown in Fig. 2 C, a combination of 150 nmAS-JNK1 plus 150 nm AS-JNK2 inhibited the expression of both JNK1 and JNK2. Although the effectiveness of AS-JNK1 was reduced slightly in the presence of AS-JNK2, the overall reduction in total JNK expression with this combination was ∼85% as determined by densitometric scanning. Higher oligonucleotide concentrations (>400 nm total), whether antisense or scrambled, generated nonspecific toxicity, which may also have been due to the higher concentration of Lipofectin required for efficient uptake; but 300 nm total oligonucleotide was well tolerated with no signs of cytotoxicity up to 96 h. Therefore, we chose as an optimum condition for the remaining experiments a combination of 150 nm AS-JNK1 and 150 nm AS-JNK2, with 150 nm Scr-JNK1 and 150 nm Scr-JNK2 as the control, with cells harvested 60 h post-transfection. Cells were transfected with AS-JNK1/2 or Scr-JNK1/2 for 4.5 h and maintained for 44 h to allow JNK protein levels to diminish. Cells were then either untreated or treated with 30 nm vinblastine for 1 h, followed by incubation in drug-free medium for 15 h, and harvested (60 h post-transfection). JNK-mediated NH2-terminal phosphorylation of endogenous c-Jun and ATF-2 was evaluated using appropriate phospho-specific antibodies, and Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Raf-1 phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3 A, the vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2, observed under control conditions in the presence of scrambled oligonucleotides, was inhibited by AS-JNK1/2. Vinblastine-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation, characterized by the presence of several immunoreactive bands of slower mobility, was also inhibited by AS-JNK1/2 treatment. The extent of inhibition of c-Jun, ATF-2, and Bcl-2 phosphorylation by the JNK antisense oligonucleotides was 75–85% as determined by densitometry (Fig.3 C). Immunoblotting with anti-Bcl-XL antibody showed two bands of 30 and 28 kDa in extracts from control cells; and after vinblastine treatment, the 30-kDa but not the 28-kDa species underwent a mobility shift (Fig. 3 A). A doublet for Bcl-XL at 28–30 kDa, with vinblastine-mediated phosphorylation of the higher molecular mass species, has been described previously in studies of several other cell lines (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar). The identity of the 28-kDa species is currently uncertain. The vinblastine-induced mobility shift of 30-kDa Bcl-XL was partially reversed by AS-JNK1/2 such that both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated species were present, corresponding to 65% inhibition of Bcl-XL phosphorylation (Fig. 3 C). Importantly, the phosphorylation-induced mobility shift of Raf-1 by vinblastine was completely unaffected by AS-JNK1/2, showing that the oligonucleotides exhibit selective effects on phosphorylation and indicating that Raf-1 phosphorylation is not dependent on JNK signaling. The expression of JNK1 and JNK2 in these samples is also shown in Fig. 3 A to confirm reduced expression by AS-JNK1/2 under the experimental conditions. The gel mobility shifts in Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Raf-1, as well as immunoreactivity with the anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody, were lost after treatment of extracts with acid phosphatase, confirming they are due to phosphorylation (Fig.3 B; data not shown). Essentially identical results to those shown in Fig. 3 A were obtained in two additional experiments, and quantitation of the results from these studies is presented in Fig. 3 C. The results presented above suggest that in response to vinblastine, activated JNK phosphorylates both nuclear (c-Jun, ATF-2) and non-nuclear (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) substrates. JIP-1 was originally identified as an inhibitor of JNK signaling (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and is now known to act as a scaffold coordinating components in the mixed lineage kinase/MKK7/JNK module (23Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Tournier C. Yasuda J. Davis R.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1671-1674Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, JIP-1 causes cytoplasmic retention of JNK and prevents its access to nuclear targets (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). We prepared cells stably expressing JIP-1 to determine whether such an approach would selectively block nuclear versusnon-nuclear JNK substrate phosphorylation. Two independent transfectants were chosen, JIP-1-1 and JIP-1-37, which expressed comparable levels of JIP-1 as determined by T7 tag immunoreactivity (Fig. 4). When cells were treated with vinblastine, JIP-1 underwent a mobility shift consistent with its phosphorylation. JIP-1 has previously been shown to be phosphorylated by JNK when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (22Dickens M. Rogers J.S. Cavanagh J. Raitano A. Xia Z. Halpern J.R. Greenberg M.E. Sawyers C.L. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 277: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 was inhibited in both JIP-1 transfectants, whereas Raf-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XLphosphorylation was unaffected (Fig. 4). These results are consistent with the known mechanism of action of overexpressed JIP-1 and indicate that JNK access to nuclear substrates is specifically restricted in the presence of overexpressed JIP-1. Despite the fact that microtubule inhibitors induce phosphorylation of both Raf-1 and Bcl-2, the link between these parameters has remained unclear. To determine whether the mobility shift in Raf-1 parallels changes in Raf-1 activity, we subjected extracts from control and vinblastine-treated cells to Raf-1 immunocomplex assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Raf-1, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL was observed as before (Fig. 3); and in addition, we observed inactivation of ERK as shown by loss of expression of phosphorylated/activated ERK1/2 versus unchanged total ERK1/2 expression (Fig. 5 A). Thus, Raf-1 phosphorylation coincides with inactivation of ERK after vinblastine treatment. Direct immunocomplex assay of Raf-1 was performed with GST-MEK as substrate. As shown in Fig. 5 B, in complete reaction mixtures performed in duplicate, Raf-1 enzymatic activity for MEK substrate was observed only in extracts from untreated cells, not in extracts from vinblastine-treated cells. Appropriate controls were performed and showed only background phosphorylation when anti-Raf-1 antibody was omitted during immunoprecipitation or when substrate was omitted from the reaction mixture (Fig. 5 B). These results demonstrate that vinblastine-induced Raf-1 phosphorylation coincides with inactivation of both Raf-1 and ERK. The signals that direct cells toward an apoptotic pathway following G2/M phase arrest induced by microtubule inhibitors are not known. However, the findings that these agents induce phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and that phosphorylation may disable Bcl-2 function suggest a potential mechanism. The identification of the protein kinase(s) responsible for this type of Bcl-2 phosphorylation is therefore of critical importance for our understanding of mitotic and apoptotic regulation. In this study, we showed that vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of endogenous Bcl-2 is almost completely inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides targeting JNK1 and JNK2. The antisense oligonucleotides utilized were highly specific for inhibition of JNK isoform expression and effectively inhibited vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of two known JNK substrates, c-Jun and ATF-2. These results provide compelling evidence that the JNK pathway is responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation in response to vinblastine. The results are consistent with other reports that have used independent approaches to implicate JNK in Bcl-2 phosphorylation. In an earlier study, Maundrell et al. (14Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U. Vial-Knecht E. Martinou J.C. Arkinstall S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25238-25242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) showed that JNK phosphorylated Bcl-2 both in vitro and in Bcl-2-overexpressing COS-7 cells that coexpress JNK and active Rac1. Based on mutagenesis and phosphopeptide sequence analysis, four sites (Thr56, Ser70, Thr74, and Ser87) were identified that are present in a putative unstructured flexible loop. Each of these sites occurs NH2-terminal to a proline residue, a well established recognition determinant for MAPKs (24Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). Srivastava et al.(25Srivastava R.K. Mi Q.S. Hardwick J.M. Longo D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3775-3780Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) demonstrated paclitaxel-mediated phosphorylation of Bcl-2 at Ser70 in breast cancer cells that was inhibited by dominant-negative JNK. A very recent study also concluded that JNK is responsible for paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in Jurkat cells overexpressing Bcl-2 (26Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Major sites were identified as Thr69, Ser70, and Ser87. Ser70 was also found as a major site of Bcl-2 phosphorylation in G2/M phase enriched cell populations (26Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), and other studies have also suggested that Bcl-2 phosphorylation occurs during normal mitotic progression (7Ling Y.H. Tornos C. Perez-Soler R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18984-18991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 8Scatena C.D. Stewart Z.A. Mays D. Tang L.J. Keefer C.J. Leach S.D. Pietenpol J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30777-30784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These results collectively suggest the intriguing possibility that JNK activation by microtubule inhibitors represents a persistent form of normal mitotic enzyme activation, with Bcl-2 as a key target. Our data contrast with several reports indicating that kinases other than JNK catalyze Bcl-2 phosphorylation in response to microtubule inhibition. In one study, evidence against a role for JNK was based on different kinetics of JNK activation and Bcl-2 phosphorylation (15Attalla H. Westberg J.A. Andersson L.C. Adlercreutz H. Makela T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 616-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In another report, it was concluded that JNK was not responsible for Bcl-2 phosphorylation because transient expression of putative upstream components, Ha-Ras or MEKK1, failed to induce Bcl-2 phosphorylation in UP293 cells (13Blagosklonny M.V. Chuman Y. Bergan R.C. Fojo T. Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the expression of these plasmids may not imitate the appropriate signaling pathway for Bcl-2 phosphorylation by JNK. In addition, many stimuli that activate JNK such as DNA-damaging agents fail to induce phosphorylation of Bcl-2 (e.g. Ref.4Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar), 2M. Fan, M. Goodwin, C. Brantley-Finley, and T. C. Chambers, unpublished observations. suggesting that substrate accessibility may be a key factor enabling JNK to phosphorylate Bcl-2 under appropriate cellular conditions. Further evidence against a role for JNK was suggested by transient expression of a combination of dominant-negatives to components in the JNK pathway, namely dnASK1, dnSEK1, and dnJNK1, which failed to inhibit paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation in ovarian carcinoma cells (17Wang T.H. Popp D.M. Wang H.S. Saitoh M. Mural J.G. Henley D.C. Ichijo H. Wimalasena J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8208-8216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Importantly, however, Yamamoto et al. (26Yamamoto K. Ichijo H. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) reported a similar result, but found that a different combination, namely dnASK1, dnMKK7, and dnJNK1, was very effective in inhibiting paclitaxel-induced Bcl-2 phosphorylation. These results suggest that very specific three-kinase modules may be involved in Bcl-2 phosphorylation and that only specific dominant-negative combinations are inhibitory. Based on the sequences around the identified phosphorylation sites in the loop region of Bcl-2 (14Maundrell K. Antonsson B. Magnenat E. Camps M. Muda M. Chabert C. Gillieron C. Boschert U.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8469-8478Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar), direct phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (12Srivastava R.K. Srivastava A.R. Korsmeyer S.J. Nesterova M., C.C. Yoon S. Longo D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) or protein kinase C (27Ruvolo P.P. Xingming D. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25436-25442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) is also unlikely because proximal basic residues required by these kinases (24Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) are lacking. Bcl-XL was also phosphorylated in KB-3 cells after vinblastine treatment (Fig. 2). Poruchynsky et al. (9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3331-3338PubMed Google Scholar) previously reported Bcl-XL phosphorylation in several malignant cells lines in response to paclitaxel and vinblastine. Our finding that Bcl-XL phosphorylation is partially inhibited by antisense oligonucleotides to JNK (Fig. 3) suggests that JNK may at least in part be responsible. Further work will be required to substantiate this conclusion. Although the sites phosphorylated in response to microtubule inhibitors are presently unknown, Kharbanda et al. (18Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) recently reported JNK-mediated phosphorylation of Thr47 and Thr15 in Bcl-XL after exposure of U937 cells to ionizing radiation. A non-phosphorylatable form of Bcl-XL was more effective than the wild type in blocking apoptosis (18Kharbanda S. Saxena S. Yoshida K. Pandey P. Kaneki M. Wang Q. Cheng K. Chen Y.N. Campbell A. Sudha T. Yuan Z.M. Narula J. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 322-327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), suggesting, perhaps like Bcl-2, that phosphorylation inhibits its anti-apoptotic activity. In addition to phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, microtubule inhibitors characteristically cause a hyperphosphorylation of Raf-1. A major question is whether Raf-1 hyperphosphorylation is activating and, if so, whether Bcl-2 phosphorylation requires Raf-1 activation. Although many reports have demonstrated a phosphorylation-induced mobility shift in Raf-1 after microtubule disruption (4Blagosklonny M.V. Giannakakou P. El-Deiry W.S. Kingston D.G.I. Higgs P.I. Neckers L. Fojo T. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 130-135PubMed Google Scholar, 9Poruchynsky M.S. Wang E.E. Rudin C.M. Blagosklonny M.V. Fojo T.

Leukemia. 1999; 13: 1028-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), Raf-1 enzymatic activity was not evaluated. This is a critical point because Raf-1 activity can be modulated both positively and negatively by different phosphorylation events (28Wartmann M. Hofer P. Turowski P. Saltiel A.R. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3915-3923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). One study showed an apparent increase in Raf-1 activity in paclitaxel-treated A549 cells using an indirect protein kinase C-coupled assay (29Torres K. Horwitz S.B. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3620-3626PubMed Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that although Raf-1 from control cells was active, hyperphosphorylated Raf-1 from vinblastine-treated cells was inactive toward MEK; and in parallel, ERK became inactivated (Fig. 5). These results demonstrate an inactivation of the Raf-1/MEK/ERK pathway in response to vinblastine. Whether the hyperphosphorylated form of Raf-1 present after vinblastine treatment is completely inactive or simply inactive toward MEK, but active toward other targets, will require further investigation. With an increasing body of evidence implicating JNK in Bcl-2 phosphorylation, it is increasingly difficult to place Raf-1 in the pathway because, to our knowledge, there is no precedent for Raf acting upstream of JNK. One possibility is that Raf-1 may play a non-catalytic role in Bcl-2 phosphorylation, perhaps via physical interaction as suggested by an earlier study that showed that Bcl-2 can target Raf-1 to mitochondria (11Wang H.G. Rapp U.R. Reed J.C. Cell. 1996; 87: 629-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). An important aspect of our findings is that JNK phosphorylates both nuclear (c-Jun, AFT-2) and non-nuclear (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL) substrates following activation by vinblastine. Although compartmentalization of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins may be more relaxed following nuclear envelope breakdown at G2/M, the ability of overexpressed JIP-1 to block c-Jun/ATF-2 phosphorylation but not Bcl-2/Bcl-XL phosphorylation (Fig. 4) is also consistent with a bifurcation in signaling downstream of JNK. The present findings suggest the potential for transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms of JNK function, even in the context of a single stimulus in a specific cell type. It remains to be determined whether the functional consequences of vinblastine-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, c-Jun, and ATF-2 are complementary or oppositional. Thus, a major challenge will be to determine how these diverse downstream signals are coordinated to allow cells to respond appropriately to microtubule inhibition.

The insulin response elements (IREs) of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) genes bind members of the FKHR and HNF3 subclasses of Fox proteins. Previous mutational analyses of the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs revealed mutations which do not affect the binding of HNF3 proteins to these elements but do eliminate the ability of the IREs to mediate an insulin response. This dissociation of binding and function provided compelling evidence that HNF3 proteins,per se, are not insulin response proteins. The same approach was used here to determine if FKHRL1, a member of the FKHR subclass of Fox proteins, binds to the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs in a manner that correlates with the ability of these elements to mediate an insulin response. Overexpression of FKHRL1 stimulates transcription from transfected reporter constructs that contain a multimerized PEPCK IRE or an IGFBP-1 IRE and this stimulation is repressed by insulin. There is a direct correlation between the ability of mutant versions of the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs to bind FKHRL1 and their ability to mediate FKHRL1-induced transcription when FKHRL1 is overexpressed. However, under conditions where FKHRL1 is not overexpressed, there is a lack of correlation between FKHRL1 binding to mutant versions of the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs and the ability of these elements to mediate an insulin response. Therefore, the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs mediate FKHRL1-induced transcription and its inhibition by insulin when this protein is overexpressed, but at the normal cellular concentration of FKHRL1 the insulin response mediated by these elements must involve another protein.

Many of these genes are regulated by insulin at the transcriptional level, but the molecular details by which this regulation is achieved are poorly understood. Progress in this area has been hampered by the fact that there is no consensus insulin response element (IRE)1 that can account for the regulation of all insulin-responsive genes. However, an IRE with a T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T) core sequence has been associated with insulin-induced transcriptional repression of a number of metabolic genes, including those that encode phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), tyrosine aminotransferase, glucose-6-phosphatase, apolipoprotein C III, and aspartate aminotransferase (3O'Brien R.M.

Trans-acting factors that interact with the IREs of these genes have been identified, but none have been directly shown to mediate an insulin response. The PEPCK IRE co-localizes with an element in the PEPCK promoter termed the glucocorticoid accessory factor 2 (gAF2) element (3O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K.

The gAF2 element is a component of the PEPCK glucocorticoid response unit and is required for a full glucocorticoid response by the PEPCK gene (10Granner D. O'Brien R. Imai E. Forest C. Mitchell J.

Winged helix/forkhead (Fox) proteins of the HNF3 subclass are responsible for the accessory activity of gAF2 (12O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R.

The co-localization of the IRE with gAF2 led to the hypothesis that HNF3 proteins might also be involved in mediating the insulin response (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol.

However, point mutation analysis of the gAF2 element showed that there is no correlation between the binding of HNF3 proteins and the ability of the element to confer insulin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter (13Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). The IGFBP-1 IRE, like the PEPCK IRE, is involved in the regulation of IGFBP-1 gene expression by glucocorticoids, and HNF3 proteins mediate this function (12O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A.

The subsequent identification of DAF-16 as a Fox family member led to the speculation that FKHR proteins might be downstream targets of insulin-activated PKB in mammalian cells and might be responsible for mediating the regulation of gene expression by insulin. Indeed, the FKHR proteins are phosphorylated by PKB in vitro and in vivo, and FKHR proteins can bind the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs (17Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol.

In the case of FKHRL1, the protein used in this study, activated PKB phosphorylates Thr32 and Ser253 in vivo but a third site, Ser315, appears to be phosphorylated by a different kinase. Phosphorylation of Thr32 and Ser253 in FKHRL1 leads to the sequestration of the protein in the cytoplasm, thus removing it from its site of action in the nucleus (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

Several studies have shown that the overexpression of FKHR proteins in cells leads to a stimulation of transiently transfected reporter constructs containing the IGFBP-1 IRE, and that this transactivation is blocked by treatment of the transfected cells with insulin (17Tang E.D.

However, high level expression of FKHR proteins in cells could mask the existence of another protein that mediates the insulin response under physiological conditions. Therefore, in the present study, wild-type and mutant versions of the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs were analyzed for their ability to confer insulin responsiveness to a heterologous promoter in the presence or absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. There is a direct correlation between the binding of FKHRL1 to the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs and the ability of these elements to mediate transactivation when FKHRL1 is overexpressed. Insulin represses the transcriptional activation caused by overexpressed FKHRL1. However, the insulin response mediated by the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1 does not correlate with FKHRL1 binding. We suggest that another factor must be required for the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IRE-mediated insulin response when FLKHRL1 is at physiological levels in the cell. H4IIE rat hepatoma cells were maintained in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) serum (2% newborn, 3% calf, 5% fetal bovine). Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure as described previously (9Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), except that the cells were returned to α-minimum essential medium (10% serum) after exposure to the DNA precipitate. The cells were transfected with 10 μg of reporter plasmid and, where indicated, with 2.5 μg of FKHRL1 expression vector or empty vector (pECE). The transfected cells were incubated 18 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and in the absence or presence of 10 nm insulin. CAT assays were performed according to the method of Nordeen (31Nordeen S.K. Green III, P.P. Fowlkes D.M. DNA. 1987; 6: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (32Hall R.K. Scott D.K. Noisin E.L. Lucas P.C. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5527-5535Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Luciferase assays were performed using the Firefly luciferase assay system (Promega). The plasmid TKCVI contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter ligated upstream of the CAT gene (33Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides, containing either the wt PEPCK IRE sequence or a mutant version of the sequence, were cloned into the BamHI site of TKCVI to produce the PC42 series of plasmids (3O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). A PvuII-BglII fragment from PC42wt, PC42m5, or PC42m7 was cloned into SmaI-BglII cut pGL3-Basic (Promega) to construct the PL42 series of plasmids, which contain a luciferase (luc) reporter gene. The construction of the IG-IRE/TK series of plasmids began with the construction of TK/luc. This plasmid was derived from PL42wt by two site-directed mutagenesis steps, which created a single BamHI site at position −40 of the TK promoter in the context of pGL3. A BamHI site in the pGL3 vector was first eliminated by a single base change, and then a BamHI site was created upstream of the PEPCK IRE insert in PL42wt. The resulting construct was cut with BamHI to remove the IRE insert, and this was then religated to create TK/luc. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a wt or mutant version of the IGFBP1 IRE were cloned into the BamHI site of TK/luc to generate the IG-IRE/TK plasmid series. The 3×PEP-IRE/SV, 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m5), and 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7) plasmids were made by cloning a double-stranded 56-mer containing three copies of the PEPCK IRE separated by XhoI restriction sites into XhoI-BglII cut pGL3-promoter vector (Promega). The plasmids pECE, pFKHRL1wt, and pFKHRL1tm (which contains alanines substituted for Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315) have been described elsewhere (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P.

Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar) and were provided by Anne Brunet and Michael Greenberg. Whole cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Novex) at 200 V for 1 h. The protein was transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Novex) for 75 min at 30 V. After thorough washing, the membrane was treated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then kept at 4 °C overnight. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated, anti-rabbit secondary antibody treatment was added for 30 min, and a chemiluminescence assay was performed using the Western Breeze kit (Novex). Polyclonal anti-FKHRL1, anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Thr32), and anti-phospho-FKHRL1(Ser253) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology. Human FKHRL1 cDNA cloned into pGex 4t3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was a gift from Anne Brunet and Michael Greenberg. GST/FKHRL1 was purified from Escherichia coli (BL21) using a glutathione-Sepharose 4b affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Conditions for EMSA were identical to those used for GST/FKHR (20Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ng of GST/FKHRL1 was incubated in a reaction mix containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 ng of poly(dG-dC), and ∼5 fmol of radiolabeled probe. Unlabeled, competitor oligonucleotides were added before the addition of protein. The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 15 min. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE running buffer. The presence of FKHRL1 in hepatoma cells was determined by Western blot analysis using an FKHRL1 antibody. FKHRL1 migrates as a 100-kDa protein on an SDS gel and H4IIE and HepG2 cell extracts contain a 100-kDa protein that interacts with FKHRL1 antibody (Fig.1 A). The difference in the intensity of the bands is presumably not due to a change in the amount of the protein, since a 15-min insulin treatment period was employed. The changes noted are more likely owing to an insulin-induced change in the epitope-antibody interaction (see below). Residues Ser253 and Thr32 of FKHRL1 are known targets of PKB-stimulated phosphorylation (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). The treatment of H4IIE cells with insulin results in a concentration-dependent phosphorylation of both sites as detected by phospho-Ser253and phospho-Thr32 antibodies (Fig. 1, B and C). This phosphorylation is dependent on PI 3-kinase as the treatment of H4IIE cells in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 blocked the insulin-induced phosphorylation (Fig.1 D). These data show that H4IIE cells contain FKHRL1 and that this protein is phosphorylated in a manner consistent with that demonstrated in other cell types. Mutations of the PEPCK IRE that affect binding of FKHRL1 should also affect the ability of FKHRL1 to transactivate and mediate an insulin response through this element. Transversion mutations were produced throughout the 10-base pair region that constitutes the PEPCK IRE to address this hypothesis. The wt and mutant versions of the PEPCK IRE were inserted 12 base pairs upstream of the TATA box in the TKCVI reporter vector to produce the PC42 family of plasmids (see Ref. 3O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar and “Experimental Procedures”). H4IIE cells were transfected with this series of plasmids, and the ability of insulin to repress transcription from the TK promoter was determined by the measurement of CAT activity (Fig.2). A single copy of the wt PEPCK IRE confers insulin responsiveness to the TK promoter such that insulin treatment of PC42wt-transfected cells causes about a 50% reduction of CAT activity as compared with untreated cells. A triple transversion mutation of base pairs 1–3 of the IRE insert has no effect on the ability of the IRE to mediate an insulin response, nor did mutations at positions 4 or 8–10. Mutations of the central core at base pairs 5–7 had a significant effect on the ability of the IRE to mediate an insulin response in the context of TKCVI, and mutation of base pairs 5 or 7 completely abolished insulin responsiveness (Fig. 2). The binding of partially purified GST/FKHRL1 was investigated by EMSA (see “Experimental Procedures”). A radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains the PEPCK IRE was used as a probe and the competitor oligonucleotides contained either the wild-type IRE (wt), an IRE mutated at position 5 (m5), or an IRE mutated at position 7 (m7). The wt and m7 oligonucleotides competed equally well with the wt probe for binding of GST/FKHRL1 whereas the m5 oligonucleotide competed poorly (Fig. 3). Identical results were obtained when the binding of HNF3 proteins to the PEPCK IRE was examined (12O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,13Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that members of the Fox family of transcription factors may recognize this sequence in a similar manner. The ability of GST/FKHRL1 to bind to the m7-IRE as efficiently as it does to the wt-IRE indicates a dissociation of binding and function since the m7 mutation abolishes the ability of the IRE to mediate an insulin response (see Fig. 2). The dissociation of binding from function noted above (compare Figs. 2 and3) suggests that endogenous FKHRL1 per se is not involved in the physiologic regulation of the PEPCK gene IRE. Numerous studies, however, suggest that FKHR proteins, when overexpressed, are transactivators whose activity is repressed by insulin. Therefore, the ability of overexpressed FKHRL1 to transactivate and mediate an insulin response through various PEPCK IRE constructs was examined. Cotransfection of a FKHRL1 expression vector (pFKHRL1wt) with PL42wt has no effect on luciferase gene expression from PL42wt (Fig.4 B). Insulin represses the activity of PL42wt whether FKHRL1 is overexpressed or not. By contrast, the PL42m5 and PL42m7 constructs are unresponsive to insulin in either circumstance (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, overexpression of FKHRL1 cannot restore insulin responsiveness to PL42m5 or PL42m7 even though FKHRL1 binds to the m7-IRE as well as it binds to the wt-IRE (see Fig. 3). A triple mutant form of FKHRL1, FKHRL1tm, which has an alanine in the place of the PKB phosphorylation sites at Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315, was also tested for an effect on the PL42 reporter plasmids. This protein has no effect on the activity of PL42wt, PL42m5, and PL42m7 in the absence or presence of insulin (Fig. 4, B–D). It is possible that the single PEPCK IRE in the PL42wt luciferase gene expression vector is not sufficient to mediate FKHRL1 activity in this context. Therefore, another set of luciferase reporter constructs (designated 3×PEP-IRE/SV, 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m5), and 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7)) were generated. These all contain three tandem copies of the wild-type or mutant versions of the PEPCK IRE positioned upstream of the SV40 minimal promoter. Insulin represses basal reporter gene expression directed by the 3×PEP-IRE/SV construct. Overexpression of FKHRL1 causes a stimulation of 3×PEP-IRE/SV activity (Fig.5 B), and this stimulation is blocked by treatment of the cells with insulin. The overexpression of FKHRL1tm also stimulates 3×PEP-IRE/SV activity, but this stimulation is not prevented by insulin, thus indicating the importance of the PKB phosphorylation sites. The m5-IRE in the 3×PEP-IRE/SV context is unable to mediate an insulin response and does not mediate FKHRL1-induced transactivation (Fig.5 C). This is consistent with the inability of PC42m5 (Fig.2) and PL42m5 (Fig. 4 C) to respond to insulin or be transactivated by FKHRL1, and with the observation that FKHRL1 binds poorly to the m5-IRE (see Fig. 3). The m7-IRE retains the ability to mediate FKHRL-induced transactivation and FKHRL1 binds the m7-IRE as well as it does the wt-IRE (Fig. 3), thus explaining the equivalent level of FKHRL1-mediated transactivation of 3×PEP-IRE/SV and 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7). However, the fact that insulin only represses 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7) in the presence of overexpressed FKHRL1 illustrates a dissociation between the binding of FKHRL1 and the ability of insulin to repress gene transcription through the wild-type PEPCK IRE. The same approach was used to determine if the IGFBP-1 IRE is capable of mediating an insulin response in a FKHRL1-independent fashion. Binding studies were performed using a radiolabeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide that contains the wild-type IGFBP-1 IRE sequence as a probe. Oligonucleotides containing either wild-type or mutant versions of the IGFBP-1 IRE were used as competitors. The positions of the mutations introduced into the IGFBP-1 IRE relative to the PEPCK IRE are shown in Fig. 6. Mutations were produced at positions 5, 7, and 10 of the A and B halves of the IGFBP-1 IRE. Both halves were mutated because each half-site can bind a molecule of FKHRL1 (Fig. 7 A).Figure 7Analysis of GST/FKHRL1 binding to the IGFBP-1 IRE. A, GST/FKHRL1 was incubated in the presence of radiolabeled IGFBP-1 IRE (lane 1) or PEPCK IRE (lane 2) and the mixture was analyzed by EMSA. B, GST/FKHRL1 was incubated with radiolabeled IGFBP-1 IRE in the presence of increasing amounts of unlabeled wt or mutant IGFBP-1 IRE oligonucleotides. The mixtures were analyzed by EMSA, and band intensities were quantitated as described in Fig. 3. The data points represent the average of three independent experiments. The asterisks indicate a statistical difference (p < 0.05) between the percentage of bound probe using the IGFBP-1 IREm7 oligonucleotide as competitor and that using the IGFBP-1 IRE wt oligonucleotide as competitor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) An oligonucleotide containing the dm10 mutation competed as well as an oligonucleotide containing the wt IGFBP-1 IRE for binding of GST/FKHRL1 to the probe (Fig. 7 B). The dm5 oligonucleotide did not appreciably compete for GST/FKHRL1 binding, whereas the dm7 oligonucleotide competed better than the dm5 oligonucleotide, but not as well as the wt or dm10 oligonucleotides. A set of TK/luc reporter vectors were constructed in which the various IGFBP-1 IRE oligonucleotides were inserted into the same position of the TK promoter used for the PEPCK IRE as described in previous experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”). The wild-type IGFBP-1 IRE conferred insulin responsiveness through the TK/luc vector (Fig.8 B). Cotransfection of this plasmid with pFKHRL1wt resulted in a 3–4-fold increase of IG-IRE/TK reporter gene activity, and this effect was significantly blunted by insulin. The fact that overexpression of FKHRL1 stimulates reporter gene expression from constructs containing the IGFBP-1 gene IRE, but not from constructs containing a single copy of the PEPCK gene IRE, probably reflects the multimeric nature of the IGFBP-1 IRE. The degree of repression by insulin was significantly reduced when FKHRL1tm was overexpressed; thus, the ability of insulin to block FKHRL1 stimulation is at least partially dependent upon the PKB phosphorylation sites in FKHRL1. Mutation of the base pairs at position 5 of the A and B sites in the IGFBP-1 IRE resulted in a complete loss of responsiveness to both insulin and FKHRL1 (Fig. 8 C). Thus, these bases are critical for both insulin action and FKHRL1 binding. The IG-IRE/TK(dm7) reporter exhibited a loss of insulin responsiveness in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. However, this construct is activated when FKHRL1wt is overexpressed (Fig. 8 D). Therefore, the dm7 mutation, like the analogous m7 mutation in the PEPCK IRE, highlights a dissociation between binding of FKHRL1 and the ability of the IGFBP-1 IRE to mediate an insulin response. The most pronounced dissociation of FKHRL1 binding and insulin repression is demonstrated by IG-IRE/TK(dm10) (Fig. 8 E). In this case, FKHRL1 binds the IGFBP-1 IRE mutated at position 10 as well as it does to the wild-type IGFBP-1 IRE; however, there is no repression by insulin of IG-IRE/TK(dm10) in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. Therefore, the dm7 and dm10 mutant versions of the IGFBP-1 IRE support FKHRL1 binding and FKHRL1-induced transactivation when it is overexpressed, but they have lost the ability to mediate an insulin response in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. These studies show that insulin can repress gene transcription through the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs in an FKHRL1-dependent and -independent manner. FKHRL1, when overexpressed, binds to the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs and activates transcription. This induced transactivation is blocked by insulin, but the insulin response mediated by the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 appears to be independent of wild-type levels of FKHRL1. This conclusion is based on the binding and functional data presented here, which show that certain mutations in the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs that do not affect FKHRL1 binding but abolish the ability of the IREs to mediate an insulin response. Therefore, it is unlikely that FKHRL1 is the physiologically relevant insulin response protein for the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 genes. The same mutation (m7) that, in past studies, eliminated HNF3 from consideration as an insulin response protein proved to be pivotal in the binding/function analysis of FKHRL1 on the PEPCK IRE (see Ref. 13Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar). The PC42m7 and PL42m7 reporter constructs do not respond to insulin in transiently transfected H4IIE cells. However, binding studies show that FKHRL1 binds the m7 version of the PEPCK IRE as strongly as it binds the wt-IRE. The ability of this mutation to block the insulin response through the PEPCK IRE is not limited to a particular promoter context, since it also abolishes the insulin response of 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7). The results of these studies with constructs that contain the PEPCK IRE, performed in cells with their normal level of FKHRL1, indicate a dissociation of FKHRL1 binding from insulin-induced transcriptional repression. A different scenario emerges when FKHRL1 is overexpressed in transfected cells. In this case, 3×PEP-IRE/SV and 3×PEP-IRE/SV(m7) reporter gene expression is equally enhanced by overexpressed FKHRL1 and insulin represses this transactivation. This result is not surprising since, as mentioned above, FKHRL1 binds the PEPCK m7-IRE as well as it binds the PEPCK wt-IRE. Thus, a correlation exists between the ability of FKHRL1 to bind to wt and mutant versions of the PEPCK IRE and insulin-induced transcriptional repression when the protein is expressed in excess of the wild-type level. The IGFBP-1 IRE mediates transactivation by FKHR, AFX, and FKHRL1(19–21, 34). Mutations in the IGFBP-1 IRE were produced to extend and bolster the results obtained with the PEPCK IRE. The mutations at positions 5 and 7 in each half of the IGFBP-1 IRE were studied because they correspond to the m5 and m7 mutations in the PEPCK IRE. The mutation at position 10 was studied because it is important for IGFBP-1 IRE function but not PEPCK IRE function (13Wang J.C. Stromstedt P.E. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 794-800PubMed Google Scholar, 19Guo S. Rena G. Cichy S. He X. Cohen P. Unterman T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17184-17192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). There is a correlation between the level of luciferase gene expression from the IG-IRE/TK(dm7) and IG-IRE/TK(dm10) constructs and the binding of FKHRL1 to the dm7 and dm10 IREs when this transcription factor is overexpressed. As with the PEPCK IRE, insulin represses this transactivation. However, even though FKHRL1 binds to the dm7 and dm10 mutant IREs, reporter genes containing these elements exhibited no response to insulin when transfected into cells expressing normal levels of FKHRL1. Only the IG-IRE/TK(wt) reporter gene was repressed by insulin in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. Therefore, two mutant versions of the IGFBP-1 IRE that bind FKHRL1 cannot mediate an insulin response in the absence of overexpressed FKHRL1. This dissociation of FKHRL1 binding from insulin action through the IGFBP-1 IRE provides strong evidence that FKHRL1, and probably other FKHR proteins, are not the sole physiologic mediators of insulin-induced transcriptional repression. PKB activation (e.g. by IGF-1 or insulin), or the expression of constitutively active forms of PKB, repress transactivation mediated by FKHR proteins (17Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J.

The involvement of PKB in the regulation of FKHRL1 activity by insulin is supported by our observation that a triple mutant of FKHRL1 (FKHRL1tm) in which the consensus PKB phosphorylation sites (Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315) are mutated does not respond to insulin. At least one of these PKB phosphorylation sites must be intact for insulin to repress FKHRL1 transactivation (21Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar). Notably, FKHRL1tm transactivates promoter/reporter constructs containing either multiple copies of the PEPCK IRE or a single copy of the IGFBP-1 IRE, thus indicating DNA binding and transactivation functions are not disrupted by the triple mutation. The results of this and other studies show that FKHRL1 binds the PEPCK and IGFBP-1 IREs, activates transcription through these elements, and that this activation is blocked by insulin. However, these effects appear to depend on FKHRL1 in excess of the normal cellular concentration. When FKHRL1 is at wild-type levels, insulin repression of transcription occurs in an FKHRL1-independent manner.

We demonstrate that decorin causes a sustained down-regulation of the EGFR. Upon stable expression of decorin, the EGFR number is reduced by ∼40%, without changes in EGFR expression. However, EGFR phosphorylation is nearly completely abolished. Concurrently, decorin attenuates the EGFR-mediated mobilization of intracellular calcium and blocks the growth of tumor xenografts by down-regulating the EGFR kinase in vivo. Thus, decorin acts as an autocrine and paracrine regulator of tumor growth and could be utilized as an effective anti-cancer agent.

Proteoglycans not only constitute a physical barrier to the invading tumor cells but also influence their behavior by binding and storing growth factors or by activating cell surface receptors (1Conrad H.E.

Decorin, a prototype member of an expanding family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans, plays key roles in regulating matrix assembly and cell proliferation (3Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar, 4Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Most of decorin's biological interactions occur via the central leucine-rich repeat region, an arch-shaped structure whose concave surface is well suited to bind both globular and nonglobular proteins (5Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that the increased expression of decorin around invasive carcinomas represents a mechanism designed to counteract the invading neoplastic cells (6Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 141-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on several observations. For instance, decorin levels are markedly elevated during growth arrest and quiescence, its expression is abrogated by viral transformation, and its transcription is suppressed in most tumorigenic cell lines (4Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Upon transgenic expression of decorin, tumor cells with diverse histogenetic backgrounds revert to their normal phenotype; they loose anchorage-independent growth, fail to generate tumors in immunocompromised animals, and become arrested in G1 (7Santra M.

Lack of decorin expression is permissive for tumor development insofar as bitransgenic mice lacking both decorin and the tumor suppressor p53 develop an accelerated lymphoma tumorigenesis (9Iozzo R.V.

We discovered that decorin causes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR),1 and that it binds both the soluble EGFR ectodomain and the immunopurified EGFR (10Moscatello D.K.

Despite the above findings, the mechanism by which decorin exerts its cytostatic effects is not understood. It is also unclear how activation of the EGFR by decorin would result in protracted growth suppression. In this investigation, we discovered that decorin leads to a profound and sustained down-regulation of the EGFR. Concurrently, decorin attenuates the EGFR-mediated mobilization of intracellular calcium and blocks the growth of tumor xenografts by acting as an in vivo paracrine growth inhibitor. These results provide an explanation for the long term effects of decorin on tumor suppression and suggest novel therapeutic approaches against cancer. Media and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Mediatech (Herndon, VA). Hybond ECL membranes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem. Antibodies include polyclonal rabbit antibodies against the N-terminal region of decorin (15Fisher L.W. Stubbs III, J.T. Young M.F. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 66: 61-65Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibodies against human p21 (6B6; Pharmingen), against the human EGFR (Ab-12; NeoMarkers, Inc.), and against phosphotyrosine (PY20, Transduction Laboratories). Recombinant human decorin proteoglycan and decorin protein core were purified as before (16Ramamurthy P. Hocking A.M. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19578-19584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). 125I-EGF was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and EGF was from R & D Systems. A431 squamous carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC. Generation of A431 clones stably expressing decorin in pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) and screening procedures by Northern blotting were described before (8Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Cells, rendered quiescent by serum deprivation for 24–36 h, were incubated with various ligands for 5–10 min, washed extensively, and processed for Western immunoblotting as described before (7Santra M. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Lattime E.C. Iozzo R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7016-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 8Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The growth of various clones was monitored by CellTiter 96TM, a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis was performed as described before (8Santra M. Mann D.M. Mercer E.W. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Iozzo R.V. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). A431, AD13, AD14, and AD15 cells (5 × 104 cells/2 cm2) were plated in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum) into 24-well plates (Costar; Corning, NY). EGF binding was conducted with confluent cell cultures essentially as described previously (17Nugent M.A. Lane E.A. Keski-Oja J. Moses H.L. Newman M.J. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3884-3890PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold binding buffer (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2), and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. 125I-EGF was added directly to the binding buffer along with the appropriate amount of unlabeled EGF (0.01–50 ng/ml). A large excess (2 μg/ml) of unlabeled EGF was added to replicate wells in the presence of each concentration of125I-EGF to empirically determine nonspecific binding levels. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C and washed three times with cold binding buffer, and bound 125I-EGF was extracted with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS for 15 min at room temperature. 125I-EGF was quantified in a γ-counter (Packard Auto γ 5650). Nonspecific binding, generally <2% of the input radioactivity, was subtracted from each experimental value. Specific binding was determined by the method of Scatchard using a single site model to determine theK d and number of EGF receptors per cell. While our data showed a somewhat curvilinear profile indicative of two classes of binding sites, the higher affinity class represented a very small percentage (<3%) of the total and could not be accurately resolved by our analysis. Thus, we applied a single-site linear regression analysis to the data, which yielded better fits with less statistical error. A431 cells were cultured in 12-well culture plates (∼105cells/well), while the decorin-expressing clones were cultured in microporous inserts (3 μm) and placed on the top of the A431 cells. After several days in co-culture, the target cells were tested for growth and EGFR phosphorylation as described above. For fluorescence imaging, the A431 cells and two of their decorin-expressing subclones, AD13 and AD14, were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverglasses and grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and serum-starved for 24–36 h. The cells were loaded with the Ca2+-insensitive hydrophobic acetoxymethylester form of fura2 for 25–30 min at room temperature in an extracellular medium containing 121 mmNaCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.003% pluronic acid and sulfinpyrazone (200 μm). After loading with fura2/AM, cells were washed into an extracellular medium with 0.25% bovine serum albumin supplemented with sulfinpyrazone. Subsequently, the coverslips were mounted on the thermostated stage (35 °C) of an Olympus IX70 inverted epifluorescence microscope coupled to a high quantum efficiency cooled CCD camera driven by a customized computer program that also controlled a scanning monochromator (DeltaRAM, PTI) to select multiple excitation wavelengths (18Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Fura2 fluorescence was measured at 340- and 380-nm excitation using a 400-nm long pass dichroic and a 510/80-nm band pass emission filter. At the end of each measurement, cells were permeabilized with an intracellular medium composed of 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mmKH2PO4, 20 mm Tris-Hepes, 2 mm MgATP, and 1 μg/ml each of antipain, leupeptin, and pepstatin, pH 7.2, supplemented with 40 μg/ml digitonin, and the fluorescence remaining in the cells was accounted as background fluorescence. Images of the background fluorescence were subtracted from the images collected from intact cells prior to calculation of the fluorescence ratios. To calculate [Ca2+]c in nm, [Ca2+]fura2 was calibrated in intracellular medium. To test the ability of decorin to function as a tumor repressor in vivo, decorin-producing cells were co-injected with wild-type A431 human squamous carcinoma cells into 4–6-week-old male nu/nu mice (Taconic) and treated in accordance with institutional guidelines. AD13 cells (A431 cells stably transfected with the human decorin transgene) were mixed with A431 cells in 1:2, 1:4, or 1:8 ratios and injected either alone or in the various combinations described in the text (see Fig. 7legend). Mice were carefully examined every two or three days for up to 35 days postinjection, and any tumor growth was measured with a microcaliper using the formula V =a(b 2/2), wherea is the width at the widest point and b is the width perpendicular to a. Tumors were frozen in liquid nitrogen, pulverized in a mortar, and boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffer containing 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol before processing for SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting. Parallel samples were analyzed by conventional light microscopy (9Iozzo R.V. Chakrani F. Perrotti D. McQuillan D.J. Skorski T. Calabretta B. Eichstetter I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 20Riese D.J., II Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). For example, EGF stimulates the formation of homo- and heterodimers with other members of the family of receptor tyrosine kinase, a process that generally leads to growth stimulation (21van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). However, the proliferation of tumor cells bearing high levels of EGFR, such as A431 squamous (22Fan Z. Lu Y. Wu X. DeBlasio A. Koff A. Mendelsohn J. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) or MDA468 mammary (23Filmus J. Trent J.M. Pollak M.N. Buick R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) carcinoma cells, is stimulated by picomolar but paradoxically suppressed by nanomolar concentrations of EGF, presumably via down-regulation of the EGFR (24Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). To investigate whether decorin might induce growth suppression by activating a similar pathway, we established a number of A431 clones expressing the full-length human decorin driven by the potent cytomegalovirus promoter. All of the decorin-expressing clones (Fig. 1,A and B) exhibited increased levels of endogenous p21 (Fig. 1 C) and became growth-retarded (Fig.1 D), with a proportional increase in cells arrested in G1 (Fig. 1 E). The addition of either recombinant decorin or decorin protein core (1 μm) caused growth inhibition in wild-type A431 cells, an effect mediated by the EGFR insofar as AG1478 (1 μm), a tyrphostin that specifically inhibits the EGFR kinase (25Levitzki A. Gazit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar), abrogated the cytostatic effects induced by either decorin or EGF (not shown). Three decorin-expressing clones (AD13, AD14, and AD15) were studied in depth. While the steady state levels of EGFR declined by ∼40% (42 ± 8%, n = 5), the degree of EGFR activation, as measured by its phosphorylation status, declined by ∼95% (Fig.2, A and B). When the blots were exposed for a short time (2 s), there was no detectable EGFR phosphorylation in the decorin-expressing clones. Only when the blots were saturated (after a 6-s exposure) could tyrosyl phosphorylation of the EGFR be detected (Fig. 2 A). The involvement of a nonspecific phosphatase was ruled out by experiments in which even relatively high concentrations of Na3VO4 (100 μm) caused no significant change in the state of EGFR phosphorylation (not shown). Moreover, the steady state levels of EGFR mRNA were not significantly altered in the decorin-expressing clones (Fig.2 C), although there was clonal variability in EGFR expression. When 125I-EGF binding was conducted, the number of binding sites/cell was reduced in all of the decorin-expressing clones to levels comparable with those obtained with immunoblotting (Fig.2 D). Specifically, the binding sites/cell were 2.4 × 106 in A431 cells, in contrast to the AD13, AD14, and AD15, which expressed 1.5, 1.1, and 1.2 × 106 binding sites/cell, respectively. Interestingly, the affinity constants determined by Scatchard analysis were not significantly different among the various cell lines (K d = 15–21 nm). These experiments were repeated five times with comparable results. To further prove that the affinity of the EGFR for EGF was not significantly affected by decorin, quiescent cells were exposed for 10 min to various concentrations of EGF. In agreement with the data presented above, the decorin-expressing cells showed reduced levels of EGFR protein (Fig. 2 E, upper panel) and, in the absence of exogenous EGF, displayed no detectable EGFR phosphorylation (Fig. 2 E, lower panel). However, the activation of the remaining EGFRs was not markedly altered. When the blots were quantified by scanning densitometry, the degree of EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF challenge followed a pattern similar to the controls (Fig. 2 F) although somewhat attenuated at submaximal (10 ng/ml) concentrations of EGF. Similar results were obtained with a 5-min exposure to EGF (not shown). Thus, decorin induces a substantial reduction in the number of EGFRs without affecting EGFR mRNA steady-state levels. However, decorin causes an even greater suppression of EGFR phosphorylation. A potential mechanism for the down-regulation of EGFR includes an increased rate of intracellular dephosphorylation after ligand activation (19Schlesinger J. Ullrich A. Neuron. 1992; 9: 383-391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar, 24Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 26Weiss F.U. Daub H. Ullrich A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we exposed quiescent (incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h) A431 or AD13 cells to EGF (40 ng/ml) for 5 min and then chased the cells for 1–40 min in the same medium supplemented with or without AG1478 (2 μm) to block EGFR kinase. While the control samples, treated with Me2SO vector alone, showed no appreciable EGFR dephosphorylation within the 40-min chase, the AG1478-treated samples showed a very rapid disappearance of EGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig.3 A). Although quantitatively different, the half-life of EGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation was essentially the same in both A431 and AD13 cells,t 12 ∼ 40 ± 10 s (Fig. 3 B). Notably, the EGF-induced tyrosyl phosphorylation of c-Cbl and the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, both known to be substrates for EGFR kinase, decayed even faster than EGFR (Fig.3 A). Because in these experiments the medium was not changed before adding EGF or AG1478, we conclude that the accumulated decorin synthesized in 24–25 h does not significantly affect the rate of EGFR dephosphorylation following ligand-induced phosphorylation of the EGFR. A potential problem in interpreting data from stably transfected cells is the plausible integration of the transgene into a locus that may inadvertently activate or suppress a gene involved in the EGFR signaling pathway. To address this issue, we established co-culture experiments in which either A431 or the decorin-secreting clones (AD13, AD14, or AD15) were cultured in the top chamber of a microporous (3-μm diameter) well, while the bottom wells contained A431 cells. Thus, any soluble molecules, but not cells, would be able to diffuse through the membrane and affect the behavior of the target A431 cells. After 5 days in culture in complete medium containing 10% serum, there was a significant inhibition of A431 cell growth only when the cells were co-cultured in the presence of the decorin-expressing clones at various ratios (Fig. 4,A and B). Concurrent with these changes, there was a marked suppression of EGFR tyrosyl phosphorylation (Fig. 4,C and D). In a time course experiment, decorin-mediated EGFR phosphorylation peaked at ∼ 2 h and declined to very low levels at 6–8 h (not shown). Collectively, these results indicate that secreted decorin can induce the same biochemical changes as the endogenous transgene and demonstrate a role for decorin as a paracrine regulator of tumor cell growth and EGFR kinase activity. One of the downstream effectors of the EGFR is phospholipase Cγ that binds through its SH2 domains to the activated EGFR and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated. Phospholipase Cγ catalyzes the formation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate that in turn mobilizes Ca2+ from internal stores, leading to elevations of [Ca2+]c, a signal that plays fundamental roles in the control of cellular growth and differentiation (27Berridge M. Lipp P. Bootman M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R157-R159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 28Clapham D.E. Cell. 1995; 80: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2272) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that down-regulation of EGFR results in attenuated EGF-activated [Ca2+]c signals (12Patel S. Santra M. McQuillan D.J. Iozzo R.V. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3121-3124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar,29Carpenter G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 881-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). To test if the EGFR-linked [Ca2+]c signaling could be involved in the changes in expression and phosphorylation of the EGFR described above, we monitored [Ca2+]c in intact, individual cells loaded with the ratiometric fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura2 (18Csordás G. Thomas A.P. Hajnóczky G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 96-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). The resting [Ca2+]c did not vary between the wild-type and decorin-expressing cells (48 ± 11 nm in A431, 44 ± 5 nm in AD13, and 49 ± 5 nm in AD14 cells, respectively). The addition of a maximal dose of EGF (100 ng/ml) to A431 cells evoked a large [Ca2+]c increase essentially in every cell (green-red shift,images i–iii in Fig.5 A), and the [Ca2+]c signal displayed a rapid upstroke followed by a slow decay (Fig. 5 A, panel iv). In contrast, the decorin-expressing clones showed either no elevation or a slow and small elevation of [Ca2+]c (images i–iii in Fig. 5, B and C). Time course traces of the mean [Ca2+]c changes in AD13 and AD14 cells also showed the attenuated [Ca2+]c signal in response to maximal EGF (Fig. 5, A–C, panels iv). To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the impaired [Ca2+]c signaling in the decorin-expressing cells, we monitored the [Ca2+]c responses evoked by submaximal and maximal doses of EGF and by ATP that elicits Ca2+ mobilization without activation of EGFR or phospholipase Cγ. A suboptimal dose of EGF (10 ng/ml) elicited [Ca2+]c elevations that were 70 ± 11 and 58 ± 16% smaller in AD13 and AD14 cells, respectively, than A431 cells (n = 6, p < 0.05 for both, Fig.6). The extent of suppression of the elevations evoked by maximal EGF (100 ng/ml) was 50 ± 14 and 66 ± 10% in AD13 and AD14 cells, respectively (n= 4, p < 0.02 and <0.01, respectively). In contrast, ATP (200 μm) evoked [Ca2+]cincreases that were not significantly different in the wild-type and decorin-expressing clones (AD13, 87 ± 18%; AD14, 129 ± 19% of A431; n = 10). These data show impairment of the EGF-activated calcium signaling pathway in the decorin-expressing cells. Because no attenuation of the ATP-induced calcium signals was found in the decorin-expressing cells, changes in the EGFR or a factor proximal to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation should account for the abnormal EGF-activated calcium signaling. To test whether decorin could act as an autocrine and paracrine inhibitor of in vivo tumor growth, A431 or AD13 cells were injected into nude mice either alone or in various combinations. Notably, the decorin-expressing AD13 cells did not form any tumors (Fig.7 A) even after 3 months of observation following the end point of the experiment. In contrast, the A431 cells and the 1:2 ratio generated tumors essentially with similar kinetics. However, the 1:4 and 1:8 tumors were significantly smaller than controls after 4 weeks of xenograft growth. In a second set of experiments (Fig. 7 B), we utilized ratios in which the number of co-injected tumor cells was kept proportional to the wild-type cells. The A431-injected mice (0.25 and 1.0 × 106 cells) exhibited identical rates of tumor growth and are shown as a single line (Fig. 7 B). At no time did the 1:4 (0.25; 1.0 × 106 A431/AD13 cells), the 1:8 (0.25; 2.0 × 106 A431/AD13 cells) mixtures or the AD13-injected mice show any tumor growth. These animals were allowed to live for an additional 3 months with no signs of tumor. All of the A431-generated tumor xenografts revealed extensive invasion of the deep fascia and subcutaneous skeletal muscles (Fig.7 C, i), together with copious neovascularization (Fig. 7 C, ii). In contrast, the 1:4 ratio showed very sharp margins and no infiltration of the deeper soft tissues (Fig.7 C, iii). In addition, the 1:8 ratio revealed evidence of cytodifferentiation characterized by the formation of tumor nests surrounded by a dense collagenous matrix (Fig. 7 C,iv), polarized epithelial cells (Fig. 7 C,v), and extensive keratin formation (Fig. 7 C,vi). Western immunoblotting of pooled tumor cell lysates from three xenografts revealed that at similar protein concentration (Fig. 7 D) there was a significant down-regulation of EGFR phosphorylation in the 1:4 and 1:8 xenografts (Fig. 7 E). However, no human decorin was detected in the tumor xenografts using sensitive immunoblotting assays and purified decorin as positive controls (not shown). We estimated that the decorin levels in the 1:4 and 1:8 tumor xenografts were ≤10 ng/50 μg of total cell protein. This is probably due to the poor survival of the decorin-expressing cells, since the AD13 alone never generated tumors in several independent experiments using different tumor cell inocula. Thus, the initial exposure to decorin might have been sufficient to down-regulate the EGFR for a protracted time in the A431 cells. These data substantiate the co-culture experiments described above and further demonstrate that tumor cells genetically engineered ex vivo to express decorin can suppress the growth of EGFR-overexpressing tumor cells in both a paracrine and autocrine fashion.

The NBS1gene product, p95 (NBS1 or nibrin) forms a complex with Rad50 and Mre11. Cells deficient in the formation of this complex are defective in DNA double-strand break repair, cell cycle checkpoint control, and telomere length maintenance. How the NBS1 complex is involved in telomere length maintenance remains unclear. Here we show that the C-terminal region of NBS1 interacts directly with a telomere repeat binding factor, TRF1, by both yeast two-hybrid and in vivoDNA-coimmunoprecipitation assays. NBS1 and Mre11 colocalize with TRF1 at promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in immortalized telomerase-negative cell lines, but rarely in telomerase-positive cell lines. The translocation of NBS1 to PML bodies occurs specifically during late S to G2 phases of the cell cycle and coincides with active DNA synthesis in these NBS1-containing PML bodies.

Science. 1998; 281: 1818-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Telomere length is maintained by the de novo addition of telomere repeats by telomerase (2Prescott J.C. Blackburn E.H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 368-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In mammals, telomerase expression is ubiquitous in embryonic tissues and down-regulated in somatic adult tissues. There are, however, exceptions such as in regenerative tissues or tumor cells (3Colgin L.M. Reddel R.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Recombination can lengthen telomeres in the absence of telomerase. For example, when the yeast telomerase RNA component, TLC1, is deleted, telomeres become shortened and most cells die (4Prescott J. Blackburn E.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, gene conversion mediated by the RAD52 pathway subserves telomere lengthening in rare surviving cells (5Le S. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Greider C.W. Genetics. 1999; 152: 143-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies in yeast have also implicated the Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex in telomere length maintenance, aside from its additional roles in homologous and nonhomologous recombinational repair, DNA damage assessment, and/or cell cycle checkpoint regulation (6Haber J.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 583-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The Rad50-Mre11-Xrs2 complex has been proposed to function in the preparation of DNA ends for telomerase-mediated replication and is therefore implicated in telomerase-dependent telomere length maintenance, rather than in protection of telomeric ends. In mammalian cells, Mre11 and Rad50, together with NBS1 (p95) form a complex (7Dolganov G.M. Maser R.S. Novikov A. Tosto L. Chong S. Bressan D.A. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell.

Despite their similar size (95 kDa), NBS1 and Xrs2p are quite dissimilar in sequence, although it remains possible that they will be functional analogues or early related homologues (16Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R622-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of NBS1 is unknown although there is speculation that it might recognize signals from a DNA damage-sensing complex that could be in the form of phosphorylation of serine or threonine residues that are, in turn, recognized by the forkhead-associated domain in NBS1 (16Featherstone C. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R622-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mre11 colocalizes to subnuclear regions containing DNA breaks within 30 min after irradiation of normal human diploid fibroblasts (17Maser R.S. Monsen K.J. Nelms B.E. Petrini J.H. Mol. Cell.

In NBS1cells, a deficiency of NBS1 is correlated with an inability to form Mre11-Rad50 nuclear foci in response to ionizing radiation (8Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Together, these observations point to a major role for the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex in repair of DNA double-strand breaks. The NBS1 protein is essential for Mre11 phosphorylation upon DNA damage (18Dong Z. Zhong Q. Chen P.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19513-19516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In addition, NBS1 function has been linked to ATM by the observation that phosphorylation of NBS1 in response to radiation exposure is ATM-dependent (19Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J.

Whether the mammalian Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 complex also plays a role in the maintenance of telomere length has not yet been demonstrated. To address this issue, we have undertaken to identify cellular interacting partners of NBS1 by yeast two-hybrid screening. Here we report the identification of a telomere repeat binding factor, TRF1, as an interaction partner of NBS1. We show that NBS1 and Mre11 colocalize with TRF1 in PML nuclear bodies in telomerase-negative immortalized cells during G2phase of the cell cycle. Significantly, the NBS1/TRF1 foci undergo active BrdUrd incorporation during late S/G2transition, thus suggesting a novel role for NBS1 in telomere lengthening in telomerase-negative immortalized cell lines. Full-length NBS1 cDNAs (minus the first 12 amino acids) were fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in the pAS2–1 vector and used as the bait in two-hybrid screens using human lymphocyte cDNA library. Detailed screening procedures were described previously (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Similarly, a cDNA fragment containing Rad50 (amino acid 753 to 1312), Mre11 (amino acid 1–680), or BRCA1 (amino acid 1–1315) was fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 in the pAS2–1 vector. To map the binding regions, various truncated forms of TRF1 and NBS1 were generated and fused to the GAL4 activation domain of pGAD10 and DNA-binding domain of pAS2–1, respectively, and cotransformed into Mav203 with full-length NBS1 and TRF1, respectively. β-Galactosidase activity was quantified with chlorophenol red-β-d-galactopyranoside (CPRG) as the substrate (22Durfee T.

SV40-immortalized human fibroblast cell lines, VA13, GM847, and LM217, were kindly provided by J. Shay and J. P. Murnane. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% CO2). Cell synchronization by double thymidine block in G1/S boundary was performed as described with modification (23Detke S. Lichtler A. Phillips I. Stein J. Stein G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4995-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cells blocked at G1/S transition were released and fixed at different time points (0∼13 h). For an additional arrest at early G2 by Hoechst 33342, cells were released from double thymidine block for 2 h, incubated with Hoechst 33342 at the final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml for 11 more h, washed with PBS, fixed, and processed for staining (24Tobey R.A. Oishi N. Crissman H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5104-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For BrdUrd pulse labeling, cells were released from double thymidine block for 13 h, labeled with BrdUrd for 30 min with a cell proliferation kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN20), fixed, and stained as described. The procedure was performed essentially as described (25Yew P.R. Liu X. Berk A.J. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 190-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (26Zhong Z. Shiue L. Kaplan S. de Lange T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4834-4843Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). A telomeric DNA-containing TTAGGG11 repeat sequence was labeled with 32P-dCTP by Klenow filling and purified in 5% polyacrylamide gel. For each reaction, 50 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with the telomere probe (30, 000 cpm) in a binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 5% glycerol, 4% Ficoll, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature for 30 min. The protein-DNA complex was then immunoprecipitated by specific antibody and protein A beads and washed 3 times with binding buffer. The complex was digested by proteinase K and extracted with phenol/chloroform. The telomere probe was then precipitated by ethanol and electrophoresed in 5% native polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. This immunostaining procedure was adapted from the previous published work of Durfee et al. (27Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips in tissue culture dishes and collected at various time points as indicated (random populated or synchronized). The cells were washed with PBS and fixed for 30 min in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. Cells were then permeated with 0.05% Saponin at room temperature for 30 min, followed by washing five times with PBS. After being blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS/0.5% Nonidet P-40 at room temperature for 30 min, cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C for overnight. After five PBS washes, cells were incubated with FITC or Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) for 30 min. Cells were then washed extensively in PBS/0.5% Nonidet P-40, further stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml in H2O, Fisher), and mounted in Permafluor (Lipshaw-Immunonon, Inc). Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 immunofluorescence microscope. Images captured were processed with Adobe Photoshop. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for NBS1 and Mre11 were obtained from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). PML mAB PG-M3 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). 12D7 mAB specific for Mre11 has been described before (28Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Mouse α-TRF1 polyclonal antibodies were obtained by using bacterially expressed and purified GST-TRF1 fusion protein as antigen. To establish cell clones that express a GFP-TRF1 fusion protein, we have used the inducible expression system controlled by a tet-responsive promoter. A cDNA fragment containing GFP-TRF1 fusion protein was subcloned into an expression plasmid (pUHD10–3) driven by a core cytomegalovirus promoter linked to a tet operator heptad (pUHD10–3-GFP-TRF1) (29Chen P.-L. Riley D.J. Chen Y. Lee W.-H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2794-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). This plasmid was cotransfected into GM847 cells with pCHTV, bearing a hygromycin-resistance gene and a cytomegalovirus-controlled tetracycline repressor-VP16 fusion transcription unit, and hygro-resistant clones were subsequently isolated. Several cell clones that express the GFP-TRF1 fusion protein upon removal of tetracycline were obtained. To explore the potential biological function(s) of NBS1, we used near full-length NBS1 as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to recover interacting proteins encoded by a human lymphocyte cDNA library. One of the clones thus isolated corresponded to a near full-length cDNA for the telomeric DNA-binding protein TRF1. TRF1 consists of an acidic N terminus followed by a dimerization domain and a Myb-like DNA-binding domain at its C terminus (30Chong L. van Steensel B. Broccoli D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Hanish J. Tempst P. de Lange T. Science. 1995; 270: 1663-1667Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). To determine the specific domain(s) of TRF1 required for binding to NBS1, various regions of TRF1 fused to the GAL4-transactivation domain were individually tested for their respective abilities to interact with NBS1 fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain by yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1 A, none of the isolated TRF1 fragments exhibited significant binding activity, suggesting that full-length TRF1 is required for efficient binding to NBS1. Reciprocally, a series of NBS1 deletion mutants fused to the GAL4-DNA-binding domain were tested for their abilities to interact with full-length TRF1. Interestingly, the C-terminal region of NBS1 (amino acids 534 to 754) is required for TRF1 binding, and its binding activity appears much stronger than that of the near full-length clone (Fig. 1 B). It is possible that one or more inhibitory motifs reside N-terminally of amino acid 534 within NBS1 and that the NBS1-TRF1 interaction is enhanced by release of this inhibitory function by post-translational modification such as phosphorylation. In this regard, we note that there are multiple potential phosphorylation sites in this region, some of which are subject to regulation by the ATM kinase during the DNA damage response (19Lim D.S. Kim S.T. Xu B. Maser R.S. Lin J. Petrini J.H. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2000; 404: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 20Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F. Ciccone D.N.

Because NBS1 forms a complex with Mre11, Rad50, and BRCA1 (28Zhong Q. Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Wang C.C. Xiao J. Chen P.-L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.-H. Science. 1999; 285: 747-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we next tested whether TRF1 binds to any of these proteins in a yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig. 1 C, TRF1 exhibits very little binding activity toward any one of these three proteins. These results suggest that TRF1 may bind to the Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 triplex through NBS1. To determine whether the complex of TRF1 and NBS1 exists in human cells, telomeric DNA repeats were radioactively labeled and incubated with nuclear extracts. The labeled telomeric DNA repeats were specifically coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies against either TRF1 or NBS1 but not control antibodies against GST (Fig. 1 D). These results further suggest that NBS1 binds to TRF1 in human cells and, furthermore, that the complex has the ability to bind the telomeric DNA repeats. It has been well documented that the Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 triplex is involved in DNA double-strand break repair and, moreover, that specific nuclear foci positive for Rad50-Mre11-NBS1 are formed after ionizing radiation (8Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M. Yates III, J.R. Hays L. Morgan W.F. Petrini J.H. Cell. 1998; 93: 477-486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that, in the absence of DNA damage, no evident NBS1/Mre11 foci can be detected. Interestingly, we found that NBS1/Mre11 foci could be detected in about 5% of an asynchronously growing culture of human GM847 cells even in the absence of DNA damage treatment. These DNA damage-independent NBS1/Mre11 foci colocalize with TRF1 by immunostaining (Fig.2), further supporting an in vivo association of NBS1 and TRF1 in human cells. Yeager et al. (31Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4109-4175Google Scholar) reported that TRF1 is associated with PML bodies in several telomerase-negative immortalized cell lines. Telomere length maintenance in this type of cells requires a telomerase-independent mechanism, previously designated asalternative lengthening oftelomeres (ALT) (32Reddel R.R. Bryan T.M. Murnane J.P. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1997; 62: 1254-1262PubMed Google Scholar). Coincidentally, the cell lines in which we observed DNA damage-independent NBS1/Mre11 foci are deficient in telomerase activity and immortalized through the ALT pathway. We therefore reasoned it likely that NBS1 might associate with PML bodies in these ALT cells. To determine whether this is the case, we examined a panel of telomerase-negative and -positive cell lines for the colocalization of NBS1 with PML bodies. As shown in Fig.3, NBS1 colocalized with PML bodies in telomerase-negative immortalized cell lines including human GM847, Saos2, LM217, and VA13. However, in either telomerase-positive immortalized cell lines, such as T24 and MCF7, or human primary fibroblasts (IMR90), whereas PML bodies were detected, neither NBS1 foci nor NBS1 colocalization with PML bodies could be detected (Fig.3). Because only a small fraction of cells within a randomly growing telomerase-negative cell culture contain NBS1/Mre11 foci, it is likely that NBS1 foci formation is cell cycle stage-specific, perhaps during G2 phase. To test this possibility, cells synchronized at the G1/S boundary by a double thymidine block were released into the cell cycle and then fixed at specific time points post-release for immunostaining with NBS1-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig.4, NBS1 foci formation in telomerase-negative immortalized cells occurs during late S/G2 phase. This cell cycle-specific formation of NBS1 foci was not observed in telomerase-positive cell lines. To more accurately establish the point at which NBS1 foci formation occurs during S/G2 phase, cells released from a double thymidine block were subsequently treated with Hoechst 33342, which specifically arrests cells at G2 phase. A significantly higher percentage of NBS1 foci-containing cells were observed in ALT cell lines but not in T24, MCF7, or HeLa cells (Fig. 4). These results suggest that NBS1 specifically translocates to PML bodies in ALT cells at G2 phase. Telomere repeat sequences have been found in TRF1-containing PML bodies (31Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4109-4175Google Scholar) and, as demonstrated above, NBS1 is localized to such PML bodies. It is therefore very likely that these PML bodies represent sites for maintaining telomere length in ALT cells. To test this possibility, a GFP-TRF1-expressing GM847 cell line was enriched for late S/G2 phase cells, pulse-labeled with BrdUrd for 30 min, and immunostained with an anti-BrdUrd antibody. GM847 cells were also subjected to an identical procedure and immunostained with anti-BrdUrd and anti-NBS1 antibodies. As shown in Fig.5, the PML bodies in a fraction of GM847 cells, as indicated by NBS1 immunostaining or GFP-TRF1 immunofluorescence, underwent active BrdUrd incorporation at late S/G2 phase. By contrast, no BrdUrd incorporation could be observed in MCF7 cells following a similar labeling procedure. These results imply that the telomere lengthening process in ALT cells that requires DNA synthesis occurs in PML bodies at G2phase of the cell cycle. NBS1 is an apparent multi-functional protein, with demonstrated roles in DNA double-strand break repair and S-phase checkpoint control (8Carney J.P. Maser R.S. Olivares H. Davis E.M. Le Beau M.

The interaction between TRF1 and the NBS1 complex suggests that NBS1 may be involved in telomere length maintenance in ALT cells. A homologous recombination-mediated mechanism has been proposed for telomere length maintenance in telomerase-negative cells in organisms ranging from human to yeast (32Reddel R.R. Bryan T.M. Murnane J.P. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1997; 62: 1254-1262PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rad51, Rad52, RPA, and NBS1/Mre11 are localized to PML bodies (see Ref. 31Yeager T.R. Neumann A.A. Englezou A. Huschtscha L.I. Noble J.R. Reddel R.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4109-4175Google Scholar and this report). Given that multiple key players in homologous recombination are localized to PML bodies in telomerase-negative immortalized cells, it is reasonable to speculate that active DNA synthesis in these nuclear domains in late S/G2 may reflect a telomere-maintenance process potentially involving a homologous recombination. However, the mechanistic details of how these factors work in concert remains to be investigated. It has been reported that yeast Rad50-Mre11-XRS2 is important for telomere maintenance in a telomerase-dependent manner, perhaps by making DNA ends available for telomerase to replicate (33Nugent C.I. Bosco G. Ross L.O. Evans S.K. Salinge A.P. Moore J.K. Haber J.E. Lundblad V. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 657-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The equivalent mammalian complex, Rad50-Mre11-NBS1, may share a similar activity, although it remains to be demonstrated. Electron microscopic analysis has revealed that mammalian telomeres end in a large duplex loop (34Griffith J.D. Comeau L. Rosenfield S. Stansel R.M. Bianchi A. Moss H. de Lange T. Cell. 1999; 97: 503-514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Binding of TRF1 and single-strand-binding protein suggested that t loops be formed by invasion of the 3′ telomeric overhang into the duplex telomeric repeat array. It is possible that the association between TRF1 and NBS1 provides a bridge between the telomere repeat sequences and the nuclease complex of Mre11 that could make telomere ends available for replication. However, it remains to be shown that the NBS1-Mre11-Rad50 triplex is located at the telomere ends for this purpose. NBS is a disorder characterized in part by an aging phenotype, and NBS1-deficient cells show accelerated telomere shortening in vitro. The link between NBS1 and TRF1 in telomere length maintenance provides a plausible explanation for these phenotypes. We thank Drs.

Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Cdc2 activation requires binding to cyclin B and phosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue (Thr161) present in the so-called T-loop of Cdc2. Phosphorylation of Thr161 is mediated by the cdk-activating kinase CAK (reviewed in Ref. 2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar), consisting of CDK7, cyclin H, and MAT1 (3Fisher R.P. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1994; 78: 713-715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 4Makela T.P. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Frutiger S. Hughes G.J. Weinberg R.A.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, the cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes can be inhibited by phosphorylation of Cdc2 at two negative regulatory sites, namely Thr14 and Tyr15 (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of these sites is regulated by the inhibitory Wee1 protein kinase and the activating Cdc25 protein phosphatases (1Dunphy W.G. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 202-207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6King R.W. Jackson P.K. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1994; 79: 563-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Moreover, cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are subject to active nuclear import and export, and during G2, export by the nuclear export protein Crm1 occurs at a very high rate, so that cyclin B is mostly cytoplasmic (7Hagting A. Karlsson P. Clute P. Jackman M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4127-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). It is not until the G2/M transition that the cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are translocated to the nucleus, where they can phosphorylate their targets and initiate mitosis. Cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are maintained in an inactive state until the end of G2 by phosphorylation of the Thr14/Tyr15 residues. Around the time of nuclear translocation of the complex, these residues are dephosphorylated, resulting in the formation of an active cyclin B-Cdc2 complex (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). As mentioned, this dephosphorylation occurs by a Cdc25 protein phosphatase. Three Cdc25 family members have been identified to date, A, B and C, the last one being the active one at the onset of mitosis. The activity of Cdc25C itself can be enhanced through phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdc2 (9Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 has been proposed to result in an autocatalytic feedback loop to ensure rapid activation of these complexes at the G2/M transition (9Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes is delayed if the G2DNA damage checkpoint is activated. This is in part the result of phosphorylation of Cdc2 at Thr14 and Tyr15 (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). DNA damage prevents the dephosphorylation of Thr14/Tyr15 sites of Cdc2 through activation of Chk1, a component of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway (11Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Chk1 was shown to bind and phosphorylate Cdc25C on Ser216, and this results in binding of Cdc25C to the 14-3-3 family of proteins (13Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J.S.O. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar,14Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H.S.O. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Binding to 14-3-3 prevents nuclear translocation of Cdc25C, thus inhibiting access of Cdc25C to Cdc2 (15Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating Thr14/Tyr15dephosphorylation, the DNA damage checkpoint also appears to affect nuclear translocation of cyclin B (16Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that sequestration of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes in the cytoplasm in response to DNA damage requires 14-3-3ς (18Chan T.A. Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1999; 401: 616-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), which itself is a p53-responsive gene that can arrest cells in G2 when overexpressed (19Hermeking H. Lengauer C. Polyak K. He T.-C. Zhang L. Thiagalingam S. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. 1997; 1: 3-11Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). This indicates that expression of 14-3-3ς is up-regulated upon irradiation in a p53-dependent manner and contributes to the G2 block induced by DNA damage. Next to induction of 14-3-3ς, p53 also drives accumulation of the cdk inhibitor p21 (20El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7869) Google Scholar). Although initially thought to be involved solely in the DNA damage checkpoint in G1, p21 was later shown to play a crucial role in the G2 DNA damage checkpoint as well (21Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). Here we have addressed the mechanism by which p21 can contribute to this arrest in G2. We show that p21 targets an event in cyclin B-Cdc2 activation different from that targeted by the pathways described previously. Thus, multiple phosphorylation events on Cdc2 are affected by DNA damage via independent pathways. UTA21.15 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1 μg/ml tetracycline, and p21 induction was performed as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For synchronization at the G1/S transition cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block. To this end, cells were treated with thymidine (2.5 mm, Sigma) for 16 h, after which the thymidine was washed away, and 12 h after the release thymidine was added back to the cultures for another 16 h. This protocol reproducibly results in synchronization of >80% of cells in the G1compartment, and >80% of the cells re-enter the cell cycle upon release in control as well as p21-induced cultures. Cells were arrested at the metaphase/ anaphase transition of the M phase by treating the cells with nocodazole (250 ng/ml; Sigma) for 16 h. Protein A/G plus agarose, the mouse monoclonal antibodies against cyclin B1 (GNS1) and Cdc2 (clone 17), and polyclonal anti-cdk2 (M2), anti-p21 (C-19), and anti-Cdc25C (C-20) were all purchased from Santa Cruz. Polyclonal phosphospecific Cdc2-Tyr15 antibody was obtained from New England BioLabs, and Plk1 was immunoprecipitated with rabbit polyclonal anti-Plk (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody was obtained from Becton Dickinson. Histone H1 and sequence grade trypsin were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Unphosphorylated α-casein and propidium iodide was purchased from Sigma. DNA profiles were obtained by staining cells with propidium iodide and flow cytometric analysis as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). For BrdUrd pulse-chase analysis, cells were pulsed with 1 μm BrdUrd for 10 min at 37 °C, chased with fresh medium without BrdUrd, and prepared for bivariate flow cytometry as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). To determine mitotic indices, cells were grown on coverslips and synchronized by double thymidine block and released. Nocodazole was added after the release to analyze accumulation of mitotic cells. Cells were stained with 20 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the mitotic index was determined by immunofluorescence microscopic analysis of nuclear morphology. At least 300 nuclei were scored per time point. [35S]Methionine labeling was performed as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and in vitro kinase assays of cyclin A and cdk2 were performed as described (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In vitro kinase assays of cyclin B and analysis of the phosphorylation state of Cdc2 complexed to cyclin B were performed as described (23Smits V.A.J. Essers M.A.G. Loomans D.S.E. Klompmaker R. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plk1 in vitro kinase assays were performed as described, using casein as substrate (24Golsteyn R.M. Mundt K.E. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1617-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Cells were plated on coverslips and synchronized by thymidine treatment and induced to express p21 as described above. Cells were released from the block in the presence of nocodazole to analyze accumulation of mitotic cells. At the indicated time points after the release coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence using anti-cyclin B1 (GNS1, Santa Cruz) and counterstained with DAPI to analyze the nuclear morphology. Immunofluorescence was recorded using confocal laser fluorescence microscopy. Recombinant CAK was prepared by infection of SF9 insect cells with baculoviruses encoding cyclin H, hemagglutinin-tagged cdk7 2T. Vallenius and T. P. Mäkelä, unpublished results. and MAT1 (25Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O. Cell. 1995; 83: 47-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). 48 h post-infection cells were lysed in 5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, supplemented with 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysate containing recombinant CAK was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C with immunoprecipitates of cyclin B prepared from UTA21.15 cells. Mock-infected insect cells were used as control and contained no detectable CAK activity. Cyclin B immunocomplexes were then washed with 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 5 mm NaF, and kinase assays were then performed as described (23Smits V.A.J. Essers M.A.G. Loomans D.S.E. Klompmaker R. Rijksen G. Medema R.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 457: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For in vivo phosphate labeling, UTA21.15 cells were synchronized with thymidine and p21 expression was induced by removal of tetracycline or treatment with camptothecin as described above. Cells were released from the block, and 18 h after release cells were labeled with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h, cells were lysed, and32P-labeled cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes were immunoprecipitated. Immunocomplexes were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon). Labeled Cdc2 was cut out from the membrane and treated as described previously for peptide mapping (26Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). We have investigated the effect of p21 at the G2/M transition by making use of a U2OS osteosarcoma cell line expressing p21 from a tetracycline-regulatable expression vector (UTA21.15 cells (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar)). Induction of p21 from the tetracycline-repressible promoter in UTA21.15 cells results in levels of p21 expression that are very similar to the level of expression of p21 reached when these cells are treated with ionizing radiation or DNA damaging agents (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Therefore, this system lends itself well to study the effects of p21 that would occur after DNA damage. As a first approach to study the effects of p21 during G2/M in more detail, cells in S phase were labeled with a short BrdUrd pulse, and cell cycle progression of BrdUrd-positive cells was monitored for several hours. Expression of p21 results in a block somewhere in G2 or M, because less than 20% of the cells have entered G1 after 16 h (Fig.1 a), whereas most cells in the control cultures have. Similar results were obtained when cells were released from a double thymidine block after induction of p21. Again, almost all cells that re-enter the cell cycle are eventually arrested with a 4 n DNA content, whereas the control cultures continue into the next G1 phase (Fig. 1 b). To distinguish whether these cells were in G2 or M phase, we analyzed the appearance of mitotic cells in these same samples. Again, cells were synchronized using thymidine and released from this block after induction of p21. After release, nocodazole was added to examine accumulation of mitotic cells. Control cultures start to enter mitosis about 12 h after release from the thymidine block, and at 21 h ∼50% of these cells have entered mitosis (Fig.1 c). In contrast, we could detect very little mitotic cells in the cultures induced to express p21 (Fig. 1 c), although FACS analysis confirmed that a similar percentage of cells had reached a DNA content of 4 n (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that p21 can block cells in G2. To confirm that p21 is induced similarly by the tetracycline-regulatable system as it is induced by DNA damage in thymidine-blocked cells, we analyzed p21 expression by Western blotting (Fig. 1 d). Treatment of thymidine-blocked cells with the DNA damaging agent camptothecin resulted in an efficient induction of p21 and p21 levels remained elevated throughout the release. Similar effects on p21 expression were observed upon removal of tetracycline from the medium (Fig. 1 d). In control cultures only a very low induction of p21 protein was seen (Fig. 1 d), which is consistent with the described bimodal peak of p21 mRNA in G1 and G2/M (27Li Y. Jenkins C.W. Nichols M.A. Xiong Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2261-2268PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we had shown that induction of p21 in asynchronous cultures of UTA21.15 cells results in inhibition of cyclin B-associated kinase activity (22Medema R. Klompmaker R. Smits V. Rijksen G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 431-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). However, under these conditions cells will arrest both in the G1 phase and G2phase of the cell cycle, making it hard to draw any conclusions on G2 phase-specific effects of p21. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of p21 when induced in cells synchronized at the G1/S transition using a thymidine synchronization protocol as described above. Induction of p21 after synchronization with thymidine results in a very effective inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity of cyclin E/cdk2 (not shown) and cyclin A-cdk2 complexes (Fig. 1 e). However, progression through S phase was not affected in these cells (Fig.1 b and data not shown), demonstrating that cells do not require high cyclin/cdk activity to complete S phase. This finding is in line with the fact that neutralizing antibodies against cyclin A can block S phase when injected during G1 but are no longer effective when injected in cells synchronized at G1/S with hydroxyurea (28Pagano M. Pepperkok R. Verde F. Ansorge W. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar). As is shown in Fig.2 a, we can detect a wave of cyclin B-associated kinase activity around 15–18 h after release from the thymidine block in control cultures, consistent with the timing of mitosis under these conditions (Fig. 1, b and c). However, this increase of cyclin B-associated kinase activity is not seen in cells induced to express p21 (Fig. 2 a). To analyze this effect of p21 on cyclin B-associated kinase activity in more detail, we added nocodazole to the cultures after release from the thymidine block. This way mitotic exit is blocked, and the breakdown of cyclin B is prevented. Under these conditions, cyclin B-associated kinase activity continues to rise in the control cultures up to 21 h, but very little cyclin B-associated kinase activity is detected in p21-expressing cells (Fig. 2 b). This absence of cyclin B-associated kinase activity is not a mere consequence of inhibition of cyclin B synthesis, because induction of cyclin B protein expression was not affected by p21 (Fig. 2 c). One obvious possibility by which p21 could prevent activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes is through stoichiometric binding to these complexes. To investigate what fraction of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes associated with p21 under these circumstances, we metabolically labeled UTA21.15 cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitated p21 or cyclin B. Indeed, a considerable amount of cyclin B coimmunoprecipitated with p21 in p21-induced cultures (Fig.3 a), but only a fraction of the total cyclin B pool could be immunoprecipitated. Also, we only found a minor decrease (>25%) in the amount of cyclin B present in a cell lysate depleted of p21 by sequential immunoprecipitation (data not shown). Thus, p21 is able to bind cyclin B, but this binding does not appear to be stoichiometric. This is consistent with previous reports that p21 has a low affinity for cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (29Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 30Dulic V. Stein G.H. Farahi Far D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 546-557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Winters Z.E. Ongkeko W.M. Harris A.L. Norbury C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 673-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, despite the relatively low amounts of p21 present in the cyclin B immunocomplexes, the kinase activity of these complexes is inhibited to an extent that cannot be explained by mere binding of p21 to these complexes. Therefore, we decided to investigate other determinants of cyclin B-Cdc2 activity, to understand which other factors could contribute to the observed inhibition. It has been described that p21 and family members can interfere with CAK-mediated phosphorylation of cdk2 on the Thr160 residue (32Aprelikova O. Xiong Y. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18195-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Hitomi M. Shu J. Agarwal M. Agarwal A. Stacey D.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), a phosphorylation event required for activation of cdk2 (reviewed in Ref. 2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2915) Google Scholar). To investigate whether p21 could prevent cyclin B-Cdc2 activation also by interference with CAK-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc2 on the Thr161 residue, we tested the ability of recombinant trimeric CAK to in vitro activate cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes isolated at different time points after release from a thymidine block. The inactive cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes from p21-expressing cells were efficiently reactivated by CAK (Fig.3 b) to levels comparable with cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes from control cultures. In vitro activity of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes from control cultures was only poorly elevated by pretreatment with CAK. This indicates that cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are poorly phosphorylated by CAK in cells induced to express p21, as compared with control cultures. Thus, our data suggest that p21 blocks activation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes by preventing Thr161 phosphorylation of the Cdc2 subunit by CAK. To confirm this, we performed phosphopeptide analysis of in vivo phosphorylated Cdc2. UTA21.15 cells were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate at 18 h after release from a thymidine block. Western blot analysis of cyclin B immunoprecipitates prepared at this time point indicated that a significant fraction of Cdc2 was dephosphorylated on the Thr14/Tyr15residues in control cultures and in UTA21.15 cells induced to express p21 (Fig. 3 c, right panel). In contrast, Thr14/Tyr15 dephosphorylation was completely blocked by the DNA damaging agent camptothecin in these cells (Fig.3 c, right panel). Although the upper band, representing Thr14/Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2 was efficiently phospholabeled in vivo, the lower band contained relatively little [32P] (Fig. 3 c, left panel). This suggests that the Thr161 site is inefficiently labeled under these circumstances, consistent with previous reports (34Desai D. Gu Y. Morgan D.O. Mol. Biol.

Nevertheless, we did observe a clear inhibition in the phosphorylation of the Thr161 site in the cultures induced to express p21 (Fig. 3, c and d). A similar inhibition in Thr161 phosphorylation was seen in cells treated with the DNA damaging agent camptothecin (Fig.3 d), demonstrating that inhibition of Thr161phosphorylation is not limited to our inducible p21 system but also occurs as a general response to DNA damage. DNA damage is thought to prevent the G2/M transition by two mechanisms. One is the Chk1-mediated inhibition of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes (11Walworth N. Davey S. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 363: 368-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 12Walworth N.C. Bernards R. Science. 1996; 271: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), and the other is by affecting the nuclear translocation of cyclin B (16Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Toyoshima F. Moriguchi T. Wada A. Fukuda M. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2728-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Our results show that by inducing p21, the DNA damage pathway triggers another mechanism of cyclin B-Cdc2 inactivation. We next questioned whether p21 could also affect other control mechanisms of cyclin B-Cdc2 activation. To analyze the status of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes in more detail, we performed immunoblots of cyclin B immunoprecipitates isolated at different time points after release from a thymidine block. Complex formation with Cdc2 occurred normal as judged from immunoblots of cyclin B1 immunoprecipitates probed with anti-Cdc2 (Figs. 3 cand 4 a). Activation of the cyclin B-Cdc2 complex requires dephosphorylation of Cdc2 on its Thr14/Tyr15 residues by Cdc25C. This dephosphorylation has been shown to result in a Cdc2 conformation with higher electrophoretic mobility (35Kornbluth S. Sebastian B. Hunter T. Newport J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 5: 273-282Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). We can detect this faster migrating form of Cdc2 at 15–18 h in control cultures released from a thymidine block, after which this form of Cdc2 disappears again (Fig.4 a). This timing of Thr14/Tyr15dephosphorylation coincides with the time points at which we could detect cyclin B-associated kinase activity (Fig. 2 a). Thr14/Tyr15 dephosphorylation of Cdc2 occurs at similar time points in the cultures induced to express p21 (Fig.4 a), but this form of Cdc2 does not disappear, consistent with our finding that these cells do not pass through mitosis. Again, we chose to confirm these findings in a similar experimental setup, but with the addition of nocodazole during the release. Thr14/Tyr15 dephosphorylation of Cdc2 is clearly not inhibited by p21 as judged by the shift in electrophoretic mobility of Cdc2 (Fig. 4 b). Using a phospho-specific antibody raised against Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2, we were able to confirm that the upper band represents Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2 (data not shown). Moreover, using this same antibody we could show that Tyr15-phosphorylated Cdc2 disappeared from control and p21-expressing cultures with similar kinetics (Fig. 4 c). Therefore, cells expressing high levels of p21 seem to arrest in G2 without preventing complex formation and Thr14/Tyr15 dephosphorylation of cyclin B-Cdc2. From the experiment shown in Fig. 4, it is clear that Thr14/Tyr15 dephosphorylation occurs normal in cultures induced to express p21, although the kinase activity of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes is inhibited. This would argue against the requirement of an autocatalytic feedback loop between Cdc25C and cyclin B-Cdc2 as has been described by others (9Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed the phosphorylation state of Cdc25C in the presence of high levels of p21. Interestingly, p21 can prevent phosphorylation of Cdc25C, because the mobility shift of Cdc25C associated with phosphorylation by cyclin B-Cdc2 (9Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) is blocked in cells expressing high levels of p21, as compared with control cultures (Fig.5 a). Thus, although a very tight correlation between the mobility shift and activity of Cdc25C has been reported (36Izumi T. Walker D.H. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 37Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 139-151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), our data would suggest that Cdc25C activation occurs in the absence of such a mobility shift. Other kinases have been reported to activate Cdc25C, most prominently, the polo family of protein kinases (38Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1996; 273: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 39Qian Y.-W. Erikson E. Li C. Maller J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4262-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated the effect of p21 on the activation of the polo-like kinase Plk1 in these cells. Indeed, p21 did not prevent activation of Plk1 (Fig. 5 b), indicating that Plk-mediated activation of Cdc25C can occur normally under these circumstances. As described above, DNA damage was shown to affect translocation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which normally takes place at the G2/M transition (7Hagting A. Karlsson P. Clute P. Jackman M. Pines J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4127-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 8Yang J. Bardes E.S.G. Moore J.D. Brennan J. Powers M. Kornbluth S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2131-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether p21 could prevent nuclear translocation of cyclin B. To this end we analyzed the subcellular distribution of cyclin B in cells at different time points after release from a thymidine block in the presence of nocodazole as described above. In control cultures we found that translocation of cyclin B to the nucleus was tightly linked with the onset of mitosis, as determined by chromosomal condensation (judged by DAPI staining; not shown) (Fig.6). Translocation of cyclin B to the nucleus was not inhibited in cells induced to express p21 but appeared to be accelerated compared with control cultures (Fig. 6). However, nuclear translocation of cyclin B and entry into mitosis were clearly uncoupled, because almost all of the nuclei positive for cyclin B remained in interphase in cultures induced to express p21, as judged by DAPI staining (not shown). We have shown that induction of p21 expression after initiation of DNA replication results in a G2 arrest. This p21-induced block in G2 is maintained for up to 24 h, indicating that p21 can sustain a G2 arrest for a significant amount of time. By utilizing p21-inducible cells, we have been able to untangle several events that normally occur very rapidly prior to mitosis. We show that in the absence of cyclin/cdk activity, cells can progress to a point in the cell cycle where cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes are translocated to the nucleus, and Cdc2 is dephosphorylated on Thr14/Tyr15. Our data indicate these events do not depend on prior activation of cyclin A-cdk2 or cyclin A-Cdc2 complexes. Also, these events do not require activation of the cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes themselves. Similarly, Plk1 is normally activated, and the fact that Cdc2 is dephosphorylated on Thr14/Tyr15 would suggest that Cdc25C is also normally activated. This latter observation argues against a requirement for a positive feedback loop between cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes and the activating Cdc25C phosphatase (9Hoffmann I. Clarke P.R. Marcote M.J. Karsenti E. Draetta G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 10Izumi T. Maller J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1337-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Formally, we cannot exclude the possibility that a phosphatase other than Cdc25C can dephosphorylate Cdc2 under these conditions. Assuming Cdc25C is the phosphatase responsible for Thr14/Tyr15dephosphorylation of Cdc2, our data would suggest that Plk-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc25C is sufficient for full activation of Cdc25C phosphatase activity. In addition, our data show that cells can progress through S phase into G2, with severely reduced cyclin-dependent kinase activity, because cyclin E-, cyclin A- and cyclin B-associated kinase activities are efficiently inhibited by p21. Cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes have a relatively low affinity for p21 when compared with the other cyclin-cdk complexes (29Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Keyomarsi K. Dynlacht B. Tsai L.H. Zhang P. Dobrowolski S. Bai C. Connell-Crowley L. Swindell E. Fox M.P. Wei N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 387-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Indeed, we could only detect low amounts of p21 in cyclin B immunoprecipitates, whereas the cyclin B-associated kinase activity was fully inhibited after inducing p21. This indicates that stoichiometric binding of p21 to these complexes could not be solely responsible for the observed inhibition of the kinase activity. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that p21 efficiently binds and directly inhibits active cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes in vivo. Nevertheless, incubation with recombinant CAK provides a very efficient means to reactivate the cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes, indicating that the major restriction on the kinase activity is the lack of Thr161 phosphorylation. The presence of low levels of p21 in cyclin B immunocomplexes could prevent CAK from complete reactivation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes. Inhibition of CAK-mediated phosphorylation of a cdk subunit by p21 has been shown to occur previously for cdk2 (32Aprelikova O. Xiong Y. Liu E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18195-18197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 33Hitomi M. Shu J. Agarwal M. Agarwal A. Stacey D.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 959-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This block in T160 phosphorylation of cdk2 is not due to inhibition of CAK activity in the cell, but p21 binding to cyclin/cdk complexes is thought to block the access of CAK to the activating phosphorylation site. The data presented here indicate that a similar mechanism applies to inhibition of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes by p21. Our results demonstrate that induction of p21 after DNA damage contributes to inactivation of cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes via a mechanism that is distinct from what has been described so far for DNA damage-induced inhibition of cyclin B-Cdc2. Based on our data we would like to propose that a cell has the capacity to block Cdc2 activation by at least two independent pathways upon activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint (Fig.7). The first pathway, comprising Chk-1 and Cdc25C, blocks activation of Cdc2 through retention of Thr14/Tyr15 phosphorylation. The second pathway, comprising p53 and p21, inhibits Cdc2 by blocking the activating Thr161 phosphorylation. Because activation of Chk1 is a much more rapid response than induction of p21 expression, one could hypothesize that the Chk1/Cdc25C pathway is responsible for immediate inhibition of existing cyclin B-Cdc2 complexes, whereas the p21/CAK pathway would ensure a more sustained arrest. Such a model would be consistent with the findings of Bunz et al. (21Bunz F. Dutriaux A. Lengauer C. Waldman T. Zhou S. Brown J.P. Sedivy J.M. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar), who showed that expression of p53 and p21 is not required for the initial arrest, but both proteins are essential to sustain the G2 arrest in response to DNA damage. As such, the p53/p21 pathway results in an important, independent contribution to inactivation of Cdc2, and lack of this response in certain tumor cells is expected to increase their sensitivity to DNA damaging agents.

An important issue in considering transcription factor function in eukaryotes is the capacity of the regulator to gain access to specific sites in chromatin and recruit transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors that modify the chromatin environment (14Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). These issues have been investigated for the archetypal Cys2-His2 zinc finger protein and transcriptional regulator TFIIIA1 (15–26). There is general agreement that the nucleosome can impede recognition of specific promoter elements by TFIIIA (15Gottesfeld J. Bloomer L.S.

These studies demonstrate the role of chromatin infrastructure access by transcription regulators containing zinc finger DNA binding domains of the Cys2-His2 type. In this work, we first designed 10 novel zinc finger DNA binding domains to recognize specific 9-bp sequences in the 5′ flank of the erythropoietin gene and characterized their unique DNA recognition selectivities and variable affinities for DNA. These zinc finger domains were then linked to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (27Triezenberg S.J. Kingsbury R.C. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 718-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar) and tested for their capacity to activate transcription in both transient transfections and from endogenous chromosomal loci. Our results indicate that all of our synthetic regulators that bind DNAin vitro with dissociation constants <10 nm can activate transiently transfected templates. This activation of a particular site is dependent on DNA binding affinity. In contrast, only a subset of the synthetic regulators can activate the endogenous chromosomal locus. We find that the regulators that work in the endogenous chromosome can bind within the chromatin infrastructure, but that the differential binding of distinct regulators at a particular site is largely independent of primary DNA binding affinity. These studies indicate that chromosome and chromatin organization is a determinant of zinc finger transcription factor function within endogenous chromosomal loci. The foundation for our design strategy was to scan 1000 bp of the 5′-flanking sequences of the human erythropoietin (EPO) gene to choose the best candidate recognition elements for which to design zinc finger DNA binding domains. The human transcription factor Sp1 (amino acids 532–624) was used as the backbone to assemble 10 distinct zinc finger DNA binding domains. The design determinants of these proteins will be described elsewhere 2A. C. Jamieson, Q. Liu, E. J. Rebar, manuscript in preparation.; however, the amino acid sequences chosen to recognize particular sequences are illustrated in Table I. Our strategy to synthesize the zinc finger DNA binding domains is outlined in Fig. 1. To create the synthetic genes encoding EPO-directed zinc finger proteins (EPOZFPs), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assembly procedure was applied using six overlapping oligonucleotides. Three oligonucleotides for the zinc finger coding sequences encode portions of the DNA binding domain containing the β sheet and linker regions between the α-helical DNA recognition sequences of the Sp1 zinc finger DNA binding domain scaffold (Fig. 1 A, oligos 1, 3, and 5). The other three oligonucleotides encode the recognition helices (oligos 2, 4, and 6). The overlap between adjacent oligonucleotides is 15 base pairs. The PCR synthesis was carried out in two steps (Fig. 1 B). First, the double-stranded DNA template was created by combining the six oligos and filling the gaps with a four-cycle PCR reaction (usingTaq and Pfu thermostable DNA polymerases). The annealing temperature was 25 °C, a temperature at which the six oligos would anneal to form a DNA scaffold. In the second phase of construction, the template was amplified using a pair or external primers containing KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. The PCR products were directly cloned into the Tac promoter vector, pMal-c2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), usingKpnI and BamHI restriction sites. The zinc finger proteins were purified as fusions with the maltose-binding protein (Fig. 1 C) according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The purified ZFPs (see Fig.2 A) were tested for their affinities for the DNA recognition sites within the 5′ flank of the EPO gene. DNA oligonucleotides 30 base pairs in length that contain the various sites were synthesized, annealed, and end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Binding of the ZFPs to target oligonucleotides was performed by titrating protein against a fixed amount of duplex substrate. Twenty-μl binding reactions contained 50 pm 5′-32P-labeled double-stranded target DNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 100 μm ZnCl2. Binding was allowed to proceed for 45 min at room temperature. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature using precast 10% or 10–20% Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad) and Tris-glycine running buffer (25 mmTris-HCl, 192 mm glycine (pH 8.3)). The radioactive signals were quantitated with a PhosphorImager and autoradiographed. Once the DNA binding properties of the zinc finger DNA binding domains had been tested, these domains were subcloned into eukaryotic expression vectors. The vector used was generated based upon a ZFP-less expression vector pcDNA-NVF, which was modified from pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). pcDNA-NVF contains a CMV promoter driving expression of the coding sequence encoding a nuclear localization signal (Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val) from SV40 large T antigen, a herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain (amino acids 413–490), and a Flag peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). All of the ZFP expression vectors were constructed by subcloning of the ZFP fragments into theKpnI and BamHI sites in pcDNA-NVF (see Fig.5 A). pEPOZFP−862c-NF plasmid is similar to EPOZFP−862c, except that the VP16 transactivation domain was removed. The pBS579 construct, which was used as a negative control, encodes a nonspecific ZFP gene.Table IThe designs of the EPO-binding ZFPsNameTarget sequence 5′ → 3′Subsites 5′ → 3′Designs −1 → +6F1GCTcQSSDLQREPOZFP−862aGCGGTGGCTcF2GTGgRSDALSRF3GCGgRSDERKRF1GCTcQSSDLQREPOZFP−862bGCGGTGGCTcF2GTGgRSDALSRF3GCGgRSDTLKKF1GCTcQSSDLTREPOZFP−862cGCGGTGGCTcF2GTGgRSDALSRF3GCGgRSDERKRF1GAGtRSDNLAREPOZFP−545aGGTGAGGAGtF2GAGgRSDNLARF3GGTgDSSKLSRF1GAGtRSDNLAREPOZFP−545bGGTGAGGAGtF2GAGgRSDNLARF3GGTgMSDHLSRF1GGGaRSDHLAREPOZFP−535GAGGTGGGGaF2GTGgRSDALSRF3GAGgRSDNLSRF1GCGgRADTLRREPOZFP−233TGGGTCGCGgF2GTCgDRSALARF3TGGgRSDHLTTF1GAGaRSDNLAREPOZFP−82GTGGGGGAGaF2GGGgRSDHLSRF3GTGgRSDALARF1GGGgRSDHLAREPOZFP−72GCGGGTGGGgF2GGTgQSSHLARF3GCGgRSDDLTRF1GGGtKTSHLRASp1GGGGCGGGGtF2GCGgRSDELQRF3GGGgRSDHLSKF1GCGtRSDELTRZif268GCGTGGGCGtF2TGGgRSDHLTTF3GCGtRSDERKR Open table in a new tab Figure 2The properties of EPOZFPs.

A, schematic representation of the experiment. The organization of the EPOZFP−862 protein is shown. In this experiment the stably integrated EPOZFP−862c gene was induced by Dox in 293 cells. The expressed EPOZFP−862 protein binds to the transiently transfected luciferase reporter gene whose activity is dependent on three tandem copies of the EPOZFP−862 target sequence. The perfect EPOZFP−862 target sequence and mutant versions of this sequence to which EPOZFP−862 binds with varying affinity were inserted into the luciferase reporter construct and the capacity of EPOZFP−862 protein to activate these reporters quantitated relative to CMV-driven β-gal as a control. B, luciferase assays versusEPOZFP−862c. The individual reporter constructs as indicated were transfected into the T-Rex EPOZFP−862c stably transformed 293 cells. After 24 h of induction with Dox (0.05 μg/ml), the activities of the luciferase and internal control β-gal were measured. The normalized luciferase activities were graphed against the correspondingKd values, which are represented on a log scale. Standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To generate stable Tet-inducible EPOZFP cell lines, the coding region from the pEPOZFP−862 cDNA was subcloned into pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen) using AflIII and HindIII restriction sites. The resulting pTO-EPOZFP−862 construct was transfected into the T-Rex-293TM (Invitrogen) cell line using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 2 weeks of selection in medium containing ZeocinTM (Invitrogen), stable clones were isolated and analyzed for doxycycline (Dox)-dependent activation of ZFP expression. The luciferase reporter constructs were generated by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides in an annealing buffer containing 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. The oligo mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool down slowly to room temperature. The annealed oligonucleotides containing three tandem repeats of the ZFP target sequences were inserted into the pGL3 promoter vector (Promega) between the MluI andBglII sites upstream of the SV40 promoter. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE. Luciferase reporter assays were performed by co-transfection of ZFP effector DNA (50 ng), luciferase reporter DNA (900 ng), and pCMV-β-gal (100 ng, used as an internal control) into HEK293 cells seeded in six-well plates. Cell lysates were harvested 40 h after transfection, and the luciferase activities were measured by the Dual-Light luciferase and β-galactosidase reporter assay system (Tropix). To assay the activation of the endogenous chromosomal EPO gene, we made use of established procedures to carry out Northern analysis of EPO mRNA. Briefly, poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from either mock-transfected or pcV-EPOZFP−862-transfected HEK293 cells using the Oligotex kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). 7 μg were resolved on a 2.4% agarose gel containing 2.4 m formaldehyde and blotted onto Nytran SuPerCharge membrane using 20× SSC. The membrane was hybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in Rapid-Hyb Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) containing 32P-labeled EPO cDNA probe. The same membrane was re-hybridized with a 32P-labeled GAPDH DNA probe after stripping the EPO probe. The EPO cDNA construct, pcEPO was generated by inserting a human EPO cDNA fragment obtained by PCR amplification into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) at theXbaI and EcoRI sites. The clone was confirmed by sequencing. The pTBAHVP16 plasmid, which was used to generate riboprobes for detection of both human β-actin and ZFP genes, was generated by inserting the VP16 fragment from the pcDNANVF vector into the pTRI-β-actin-125-human vector (Ambion, Austin, TX). The pcDNA-NVF DNA was digested with XhoI, repaired with Klenow enzyme, and digested again with BamHI. The TRI-β-actin vector was digested with SmaI andBamHI. For Taqman analysis of mRNA abundance, total cellular RNA from transfected HEK293 cells was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Real time PCR analysis (Taqman) was performed in a 96-well format on an ABI 7700 SDS machine (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed with SDS version 1.6.3 software. RNA samples (25 ng) were mixed with 0.3 μm each primer, 0.1 μm probe, 5.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.3 mm each dNTP, 0.625 unit of AmpliTaq Gold RNA polymerase, 6.25 units of Multiscribe reverse transcriptase, and 5 units of RNase inhibitor in Taqman buffer A from Perkin Elmer. The reverse transcription was performed at 48 °C for 30 min. After denaturing at 95 °C for 10 min, PCR amplification reactions were conducted for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. The EPO primer and probe set (GACTGTGTGCTCTGTGCACT, CTCTCAAAGTGCTGGGATTGCA, FAM-TGAGCCACCGCACCCAGCCCCCA-TAMRA) and the VP16 primer and probe set (CATGACGATTTCGATCTGGA, CTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTG, FAM-ATCGGTAAACATCTGCTCAAACTCGA-TAMRA) were used to measure the human EPO and ZFP expression levels, respectively. The GAPDH primer and probe set (CCTTTTGCAGACCACAGTCCA, GCAGGGATGATGTTCTGGAGA, FAM-CACTGCCACCCAGAAGACTGTGG-TAMRA) were used to monitor the internal control GAPDH mRNA. The abundance of expressed ZFPs was controlled for at both the RNA level as described above, but also by Western blotting. This analysis was performed by resolving 10 μg of whole cell lysates on a 10–20% Tris-HCl polyacrylamide gel containing SDS. Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using 1× SDS, 20% Methanol, and then the filter was blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. Blotting was done with anti-Flag M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:1000 in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% PBS-Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, an anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used at a 1:3000 dilution in 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk, 0.1% PBS-Tween for 1 h at room temperature. All washes were done in 0.1% PBS-Tween. The protein bands were detected by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Endogenous EPO expression was assayed either in response to transient transfection with ZFP effectors or in response to the induction of pEPOZFP−862a following stable transformation. Assays were performed at the indicated time after transfection. Either RNA was extracted as indicated above, or the culture medium was harvested for measurement of secreted EPO protein using the human EPO ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed using a ChIP assay kit according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Approximately 2 million cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS, and lysed in lysis buffer. The cell lysate was sonicated on ice, resulting in a DNA fragment length of approximately 500 bp. After removing cell debris by centrifugation, immunoprecipitation was performed in ChIP dilution buffer overnight with 3 μg of VP16 1–21 antibody (Santa Cruz) or 10 μg of anti acetylated H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). The antibodies were collected with Protein A-agarose and washed. The cross-linking was reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of 200 mm NaCl. The DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and the abundance of particular sequences quantitated using real time PCR with the ABI 7700 sequence detector from Perkin Elmer/Applied Biosystems as described above. The standard Taqman reagents and the universal thermal cycling parameters were used (10 min at 95 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C). The primers had the following sequences: −1838F, TGGTACATCTGGTGCATTGTTG; 1838R, AAATAATAGACACACACAAGATAGTGAAAGC; −927F, ACACCACAGGTCAAATAAACAGATG; −927R, ACTTTTAGTGCACAGAGCACACAGT; −363F, GGCTTCCAGACCCAGCTACATT; −363R, GGTCTTGGGCGGAGACTCA; +538F, GTGCCAGTGGAGAGGAAGCT; +538R, CAAACTTCAATCCTGGTGTGACA; +6839F, TGGGAGTACAGGCGTGAGC; +6839R, GGGAAAATGATGAAAGAGAAATCAA; hGAPDH-F, GACATCAAGAAGGTGGTGAAG; hGAPDH-R, AGCTTGACAAAGTGGTCGTTG. The Taqman probes were labeled with FAM at the 5′ end and with TAMRA at the 3′end. They had the following sequences: −1834P, AAGGCGGTGACCCCCCTGGAC; −927P, CATTGTGCAGGACACACATGCACCTTG; −363P, CGGAACTCAGCAACCCAGGCATCT; +538P, TGGGCGCTGGAGCCACCACTTA; +6839P ACCGCGCCAGCCCGTGTC; hGAPDH-P, CACTGAGCACCAGGTGGTCTCCT. For nuclease digestion, nuclei were isolated from HEK293 cells essentially as described (25Chipev C.C. Wolffe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 45-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The nuclei were resuspended at 10,000/μl in digestion buffer. This suspension was aliquoted (100 μl) into tubes and digested with nuclease for 5 min at 22 °C. DNase I or micrococcal nuclease (Worthington) was added at 0, 5, 10, 20, or 40 units/ml for nuclei or 100-fold lower concentrations for naked DNA. The reaction was stopped by adding Qiagen buffer AL, followed by proteinase K treatment and purification (DNAeasy kit, Qiagen). The recovered DNA was digested to completion overnight at 37 °C with the indicated restriction endonuclease and then concentrated by ethanol precipitation. The entire sample is loaded onto an agarose gel of 1–2%, before electrophoresis and transfer to a Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Indirect end labeling was used to detect the sites of nuclease cleavage. Hybridization was carried out in Rapid Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using PCR-amplified genomic DNA fragments as indicated. The DNA probes were radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 106 cpm/ng DNA. Hybridization and subsequent washings were performed at 65 °C. Membranes were visualized in the PhosphorImager. We made use of existing information concerning the recognition of specific sequences by zinc finger domains to design 10 proteins that we predicted would recognize sequences in the 5′ flank of the human EPO gene. The strategy for assembly is illustrated in Fig. 1, and the details of design are summarized in TableI. The details of design and selection of zinc fingers capable of recognizing particular DNA sequences will be described in detail elsewhere.2 The positions of the sequences within the human EPO gene that are targeted by our ZFP designs are illustrated in Fig.2 A. The ZFPs were designed to bind at four sites; site 1 and site 2 flank an Alu element. Alu elements are known to position nucleosomes (28Englander E.W. Wolffe A.P. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19565-19573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Englander E.W. Howard B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10091-10096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); we chose these flanking sites because we wished to avoid sites within the presumed position of stable histone-DNA interactions. Sites 3 and 4 were located −72 to −300 bp from the transcription start site (+1). We wished to introduce ZFPs here because they would be adjacent to a known region (−61 to −45 bp) important in the regulation of the human EPO gene (30Gupta M. Goldwasser E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 24: 4768-4774Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We expressed these diverse zinc finger proteins in recombinant form and purified them (Fig. 2 B). In the nomenclature that we use to describe these proteins, each of which interacts with 9 bp of DNA, the number after the prefix EPOZFP delineates the position of the first nucleotide of the recognition sequence relative to the transcription start site (+1). Thus, EPOZFP−862 describes a zinc finger protein that binds to a 9-bp sequence that is positioned −862 bp to the 5′ of the transcription start site. Where there are multiple designs to particular sequence, this is indicated by, e.g., −862a, −862b, and −862c (see Table I). The"
https://openalex.org/W2140868727,"Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), originally known from human pregnancy serum, has recently been demonstrated to be a metzincin superfamily metalloproteinase involved in normal and pathological insulin-like growth factor (IGF) physiology. PAPP-A specifically cleaves IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-4, one of six antagonists of IGF action, which results in release of IGF bound to IGFBP-4. IGFBP-4 is the only known PAPP-A substrate. Its cleavage by PAPP-A uniquely depends on the presence of IGF. We here report mammalian expression and purification of recombinant 1547-residue PAPP-A (rPAPP-A). The recombinant protein is secreted as a homodimer of about 400 kDa composed of two 200-kDa disulfide-bound subunits. Antigenically and functionally, rPAPP-A behaves like the native protein. In human pregnancy, PAPP-A is known to circulate as a 500-kDa disulfide-bound 2:2 complex with the proform of eosinophil major basic protein (proMBP), PAPP-A/proMBP. A comparison between rPAPP-A and pregnancy serum PAPP-A/proMBP complex surprisingly reveals a difference greater than 100-fold in proteolytic activity, showing that proMBP functions as a proteinase inhibitor in vivo. We find that polyclonal antibodies against PAPP-A abrogate all detectable IGFBP-4 proteolytic activity in pregnancy serum, pointing at PAPP-A as the dominating, if not the only, IGFBP-4 proteinase present in the circulation. We further show that pregnancy serum and plasma contain traces (<1%) of uncomplexed PAPP-A with a much higher specific activity than the PAPP-A/proMBP complex. The measurable activity of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex probably results from the presence of a minor subpopulation of partly inhibited PAPP-A that exists in a 2:1 complex with proMBP. Inhibition of PAPP-A by proMBP represents a novel inhibitory mechanism with the enzyme irreversibly bound to its inhibitor by disulfide bonds.

Sand O. Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of proMBP in the circulation, as well as the existence of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex was revealed, in part, by the isolation of a PAPP-A and a proMBP peptide, linked together by a disulfide bond, from a digest of purified PAPP-A/proMBP (6Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The subunits of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex can be irreversibly separated by reduction of disulfide bonds and denaturation (6Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In reducing SDS-PAGE, the PAPP-A subunit has an apparent molecular mass of 200 kDa (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and its 1547-residue sequence is known from cloned cDNA (8Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). PAPP-A shows no global homology to any protein, but it contains sequence motifs, including an elongated zinc binding motif (HE XX H XX G XX H) at position 482–492 (8Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This motif and a structurally important methionine residue, also thought to reside in PAPP-A at position 556, are strictly conserved within the metzincins, a superfamily of zinc peptidases: astacins, adamalysins (or reprolysins), serralysins, and matrixins (matrix metalloproteinases) (8Kristensen T.

PAPP-A does not conform to other defining features of the individual established metzincin superfamily members, and interestingly, in PAPP-A the linear distance between the zinc binding motif and the conserved Met residue is 63 amino acids (8Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas in other metzincins this distance is between 7 and 44 residues (11Stocker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Ruth F.X. McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The proMBP subunit has a calculated peptide mass of 23 kDa (12Barker R.L. Gleich G.J.

Kristensen T. Gleich G.J. Sottrup-Jensen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12243-12246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably due to its strong and unusual glycosylation (7Oxvig C. Sand O.

Biol. Int. 1994; 33: 329-336PubMed Google Scholar). The mature form of the protein, MBP, is known from the eosinophil leukocyte as a cytotoxic protein, where the 206-residue proMBP is processed to generate mature, nonglycosylated MBP of 117 residues that is stored in granules (15Popken-Harris P. Checkel J. Loegering D. Madden B. Springett M. Kephart G. Gleich G.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 623-631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The propiece is highly acidic and is believed to mask the cytotoxicity of MBP during processing in the eosinophil (16Barker R.L. Gundel R.H. Gleich G.J. Checkel J.L. Loegering D.A. Pease L.R. Hamann K.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 798-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cleavage of proMBP is believed not to occur in pregnancy serum, where the function of proMBP has remained unknown. Pregnancy serum contains a molar excess of proMBP compared with PAPP-A, which is disulfide-bound to angiotensinogen and complement C3dg (3Oxvig C. Haaning J. Kristensen L. Wagner J.M. Rubin I.

PAPP-A and proMBP are both produced in the placenta during pregnancy but mainly in different cell types as shown by in situhybridization. In this tissue, the vast majority of PAPP-A is synthesized in the syncytiotrophoblast, and all proMBP is synthesized in extravillous cytotrophoblasts (17Bonno M. Oxvig C. Kephart G.M. Wagner J.M. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 560-566PubMed Google Scholar). Clinically, depressed serum levels of PAPP-A are increasingly being used as a predictor of Down's syndrome pregnancies. Recent data show that measurements of proMBP also have a diagnostic value (18Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Wagner J.M. Qin Q.P. Nguyen T.H. Overgaard M.T. Larsen S.O. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J.

Analyses by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed that both PAPP-A and proMBP mRNA are present in several reproductive and nonreproductive tissues, although the levels are much lower than in the placenta (19Overgaard M.T.

Only recently, the putative metalloproteinase activity of PAPP-A has been experimentally confirmed (20Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3149-3153Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). PAPP-A was partially purified from human fibroblast-conditioned medium and shown to be responsible for the known proteolytic activity of human fibroblast-conditioned medium against insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-4. IGFBPs, of which six have been described, are important modulators of IGF-I and -II activity (21Fowlkes J.L. Trends. Endocrinol.

Rev. 1997; 18: 801-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). IGF bound to IGFBP cannot interact with its receptor, but bioactive IGF is released once the binding protein is cleaved. Interestingly, cleavage of IGFBP-4 by PAPP-A strictly requires the presence of IGF (20Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc.

Invest. 1993; 91: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). PAPP-A secretion has also been demonstrated from osteoblasts and marrow stromal cells (20Lawrence J.B. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gleich G.J. Hays L.G. Yates III, J.R. Conover C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

T., Christiansen, M., Oxvig, C., Holmes, D. R., Jr., and Conover, C. A. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., in press. all of which have known IGF-dependent IGFBP-4 proteinase activity. Here we report expression in mammalian cells of recombinant PAPP-A (rPAPP-A). This represents an important attainment for the further study of the role of PAPP-A in the IGF/IGFBP system and for the study of PAPP-A as a unique metalloproteinase. A comparison between rPAPP-A and PAPP-A/proMBP complex from pregnancy serum reveals a pronounced difference in proteolytic activity. We conclude that proMBP functions as a proteinase inhibitor in vivo. This finding establishes a biological role of proMBP outside the eosinophil leukocyte. It also represents a novel mode of proteinase inhibition with the enzyme covalently bound by disulfide bonds to its inhibitor. A PAPP-A expression plasmid was constructed from three overlapping partial PAPP-A cDNA clones, 29-2, pPA3, and pPA1 (8Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 9Haaning J. Oxvig C. Overgaard M.T. Ebbesen P. Kristensen T. Sottrup-Jensen L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 159-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The BbeI–EcoRI fragment of 29-2, encoding PAPP-A residues 6–228, 3In this paper, PAPP-A is numbered with the N-terminal Glu as residue 1, and the cDNA sequence is numbered with the codon encoding Glu-1 (GAG) as nucleotides 1–3 as in Ref. 8Kristensen T.

In the deposited sequence record (GenBankTM accession numberX68280), this Glu is residue 5, and the corresponding nucleotides are 13–15. was excised by partial and full digestion, respectively, and ligated to a nucleotide fragment encoding an artificial signal peptide (MKDSCITVMAMALLSGFFFFAPASSYAA) plus residues 1–5 of PAPP-A. In brief, this latter fragment was generated in a polymerase chain reaction using a mixture of overlapping oligonucleotides (5′-CCTGCATCACTGTGATGGCCATGGCGCTGC-3′, 5′-TGTCTGGGTTCTTTTTCTTCGCGCCGGCCTC-3′, 5′-GAGCTATGCCGCGGAAGCTAGGGGCGCCAT-3′, and 5′-GCGGCATAGCTCGAGGCCGGCGCGAAGAAA-3′, 5′-AAGAACCCAGACAGCAGCGCCATGGCCATC-3′, 5′-ACAGTGATGCAGGAATCCTTCATAAGCTTAG-3′) as a template and primers containing a HindIII (5′-CTAAGCTTATGAAGGATT-3′) and a BbeI (5′-ATGGCGCCCCTAGCTTCC-3′) recognition site. The ligation product was cloned into theHindIII/EcoRI sites of pBluescript II (Stratagene) to generate pBN-228. The EcoRI–ClaI fragment of pPA3, encoding PAPP-A residues 229–784, was excised and ligated to the HindIII–EcoRI fragment of pBN-228 and cloned into the HindIII/ClaI sites of pBluescript II to generate pBN-784. Further, theClaI–EcoRI fragment of pPA1, encoding PAPP-A residues 785–1547 and containing part of the 3′-untranslated region, was excised and ligated to the HindIII–ClaI fragment of pBN-784 and cloned into theHindIII/EcoRI sites of pBluescript II to generate pBN-1547. Because the ClaI site in the PAPP-A cDNA is sensitive to methylation, plasmids were propagated in anEscherichia coli dam− strain when required. Finally, the HindIII–XbaI fragment of pBN-1547, encoding the artificial signal peptide plus PAPP-A residues 1–1547, was cloned into the HindIII/XbaI sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen) to generate pcDNA3.1-PAPP-A. This construct was verified by sequence analysis. A deviation from the published PAPP-A cDNA sequence (8Kristensen T. Oxvig C. Sand O. Moller N.P. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1592-1598Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) was found at one site; nucleotides 78–803 (AGT) were not present, resulting in the absence of Val-27. In the original cDNA clones (29-2 and pPA3), the same deviation was observed upon resequencing. To allow for selection with hygromycin B (Invitrogen), the HindIII–XbaI fragment of pcDNA3.1-PAPP-A was excised and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen) to obtain pcDNA3.1/Hygro-PAPP-A for generation of stably transfected cells. Plasmid DNA for transfection was prepared with QIAprep Spin Kit (Qiagen). Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (293tsA1609neo) (25DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar) were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and gentamicin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were plated onto 6-cm tissue culture dishes and were transfected 18 h later by calcium phosphate coprecipitation (26Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2275) Google Scholar) using 10 μg of DNA (pcDNA3.1-PAPP-A). After a further 48 h, the supernatants were harvested and cleared by centrifugation. For generating 293T cell lines that stably express PAPP-A, cells were transfected withFspI-linearized pcDNA3.1/Hygro-PAPP-A by the same method, selected for resistance to 400 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen). Single colonies were picked and expanded, and stable cell lines were maintained in medium with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B. COS-7 cells (27Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) were maintained in the same medium but transfected with SuperFect (Qiagen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The levels of recombinant PAPP-A in the supernatants were measured by a standard sandwich ELISA. PAPP-A polyclonal antibodies, anti-(PAPP-A/proMBP), 4Polyclonal anti-(PAPP-A/proMBP) was raised in rabbits using highly purified PAPP-A/proMBP (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) (M. T. Overgaard, M. Christiansen, and C. Oxvig, unpublished). were used for capture, and a PAPP-A monoclonal antibody (mAb) (234-2, 234-5, 234-4, 234-6, 234-3, or 234-7) (28Qin Q.P. Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Pettersson K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Koch C. Norgaard-Pedersen B. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-(mouse IgG) (P260, DAKO) was used for detection. PAPP-A/proMBP purified from pregnancy serum (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) or purified rPAPP-A was used to establish standard curves. The amount of protein in the standards was determined by amino acid analysis (29Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 30: 789-794PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of rPAPP-A from cell culture supernatants was accomplished by a procedure of precipitation, heparin chromatography (30Westergaard J.G. Hau J. Teisner B. Grudzinskas J.G. Placenta. 1983; 4: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Davey M.W. Teisner B. Sinosich M. Grudzinskas J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and gel filtration. Recombinant PAPP-A was precipitated from cell culture supernatants (50 ml) by 10% (w/v) PEG 6000. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, containing standard protease inhibitors and loaded onto a HiTrap heparin-Sepharose (5 ml) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by a linear increase in the salt concentration to 1000 mmover 30 min at 1 ml/min. Recombinant PAPP-A eluted mainly as a single peak around 600 mm NaCl. Finally, pooled fractions were concentrated by ultrafiltration and chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min on a Superose 6 HR 10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline. PAPP-A/proMBP was purified from term pregnancy serum as described previously (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For analytical purposes, pooled pregnancy serum, pregnancy plasma, or culture supernatant was run on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Prior to column loading, samples were diluted by the addition of 2 volumes of water. Elution was performed with a linear salt gradient from 50 to 1000 mm over 40 min at 1 ml/min, and fractions of 1 ml were collected. For all runs, the salt concentration was 50 mm in fraction 10 and 1000 mm in fraction 50. In Fig. 5 A, the absorbance at 280 nm shown was recorded in a second run of one-tenth of the same sample and multiplied by a factor of 10. The two chromatograms obtained were superimposable, and the shape and position of the larger PAPP-A peak (around fraction 43) was the same. The smaller PAPP-A peak (around fraction 24) also had the same position in the two runs, but with the ELISA used, the levels of PAPP-A antigen could not be determined accurately in those fractions from the second run. Thus, ELISA values of the first run are shown. SDS-PAGE was performed in Tris-glycine gels (10–20% or 15%) (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) or in precast 3–8% Tris acetate gels (Novex). Separated proteins were visualized by Coomassie staining of gels or first blotted onto a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane for sequence analysis on an Applied Biosystems 477A sequencer equipped with an on-line HPLC (33Sottrup-Jensen L. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 225: 187-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For immunovisualization, blots were blocked with 2% Tween 20 and equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 9.0 (TST). Primary antibody (mAb 234-2 for PAPP-A, and mAb 234-10 for proMBP) (28Qin Q.P. Christiansen M. Oxvig C. Pettersson K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Koch C. Norgaard-Pedersen B. Clin. Chem. 1997; 43: 2323-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was diluted in TST containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum, and blots were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For detection of reduced PAPP-A, polyclonal antibodies4 were used. Incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (P260 or P217; DAKO) diluted in TST was done for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hydrolysis and quantification of amino acids and amino sugars was carried out as described previously (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). IGFBP-4 proteolysis was assayed as described previously (23Conover C.A. Kiefer M.C. Zapf J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 1129-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 34Lawrence J.B. Bale L.K. Haddad T.C. Clarkson J.T. Conover C.A. Growth Horm. IGF Res. 1999; 9: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 ng of rPAPP-A contained in 293T culture medium was incubated for 16 h at 37 °C in 2 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 10,000 cpm of purified125I-labeled IGFBP-4 (35Qin X. Strong D.D. Baylink D.J. Mohan S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23509-23516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) in the absence and presence of 5 nm IGF-II (Bachem), standard protease inhibitors, and 5 μg/ml polyclonal anti-(PAPP-A/proMBP).4 The total reaction volume was 25 μl. Intact IGFBP-4 and its proteolytic fragments were separated by reducing 15% SDS-PAGE and were visualized by autoradiography. Likewise, the activity of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex was compared with the activity of rPAPP-A in two parallel time course experiments scaled up to larger reaction volumes. Equal amounts of sample A (pool of term pregnancy serum diluted, approximately 6×, to 7 μg/ml of PAPP-A/proMBP as determined by ELISA calibrated with purified PAPP-A/proMBP) and sample B (as sample A, but rPAPP-A supernatant added to 7 μg/ml as determined by ELISA calibrated with purified rPAPP-A) were incubated with 125I-labeled IGFBP-4 in the presence of 5 nm IGF-II. Aliquots of the reactions were stopped at selected time points by freezing. The experiment with sample A was also carried out in the presence of 5 μg/ml purified rabbit polyclonal IgG, either anti-(PAPP-A/proMBP)4 or irrelevant polyclonal antibodies (anti-α2-macroglobulin, A033; DAKO). A similar time course experiment was performed for comparison of PAPP-A activity in selected column fractions. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3.1-PAPP-A encoding a signal peptide followed by the entire PAPP-A polypeptide (residues 1–1547).3 Two days post-transfection, the supernatant contained about 5 μg/ml of recombinant PAPP-A (rPAPP-A) as measured by a PAPP-A-specific ELISA. PAPP-A was not detectable in supernatants from mock-transfected cells. The rPAPP-A antigen was recognized in ELISA by all monoclonal antibodies available, and the integrity of the protein was verified by Western blotting (not shown). Similar results were obtained with transfected COS-7 cells. To establish a stable cell line for production of rPAPP-A, 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro-PAPP-A and selected for resistance to hygromycin B. A population of stably transfected cells was maintained, and further, individual cells were cloned. Recombinant PAPP-A contained in culture medium was precipitated essentially quantitatively with 10% polyethylene glycol 6000, redissolved, and further purified by heparin chromatography (30Westergaard J.G. Hau J. Teisner B. Grudzinskas J.G. Placenta. 1983; 4: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Davey M.W. Teisner B. Sinosich M. Grudzinskas J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and gel filtration as detailed under “Materials and Methods.” Our previously published procedure for purification of the PAPP-A/proMBP complex from pregnancy serum (7Oxvig C. Sand O. Kristensen T. Kristensen L. Sottrup-Jensen L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) proved useless, because unlike PAPP-A/proMBP, which is fully soluble in 16% polyethylene glycol 6000, rPAPP-A precipitated in the range of 4–12% polyethylene glycol. Purified rPAPP-A migrated faster in SDS-PAGE than the disulfide-bound 2:2 PAPP-A/proMBP complex purified from pregnancy serum (Fig. 1,lanes 3 and 4). Reduced rPAPP-A and PAPP-A from reduced PAPP-A/proMBP both migrated as a band around 200 kDa (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, rPAPP-A is secreted as a dimer of about 400 kDa. A limited degree of degradation that could not be prevented is apparent for both species after reduction of disulfide bonds (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and 2).Figure 5Anion exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 10/10 column.

Receptor tyrosine kinases regulate diverse biological processes ranging from cell proliferation and survival to cell motility, metabolism, and differentiation. The initiation of receptor signaling involves ligand-induced activation of the catalytic domain of the enzyme and the phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues on the receptor. These provide binding sites for proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2)1 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains that act to transduce signals to the interior of the cell (reviewed in Ref. 1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2229) Google Scholar). The biological responses elicited by each receptor are thus controlled by the repertoire of signaling proteins recruited to the receptor. Recently, docking proteins have been identified that act to diversify the signal downstream from receptor tyrosine kinases. These include insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), IRS-2, IRS-3, Daughter of Sevenless (DOS), Downstream of Kinases (DOK), fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2), and the recently identified proteins Gab1 and Gab2 (2Yenush L.

These proteins lack enzymatic activities, but following activation of tyrosine kinase or cytokine receptors, they are recruited to the receptor complex and become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, providing binding sites for multiple proteins involved in signal transduction. In this manner they act to diversify and localize signals downstream from receptors by virtue of their ability to assemble multiprotein complexes. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), also known as scatter factor, is a multifunctional factor that stimulates a wide variety of cellular responses including mitogenesis, motility, and invasiveness of carcinoma cells but induces the inherent morphogenic program of kidney, breast, and lung epithelium grown in matrix culture and promotes organ regeneration in vivo (10Matsumoto K.

From a search for Met-specific substrates that are implicated in modulating epithelial morphogenesis, we have recently identified theGrb2-associated binder (Gab1), as a protein that becomes highly phosphorylated following HGF stimulation of epithelial cells that undergo a morphogenic program (22Nguyen L.

From structure-function analyses using Met receptor mutants, the phosphorylation and recruitment of Gab1 to the Met receptor require the presence of two tyrosine residues within the carboxyl terminus of Met (Tyr-1349 and Tyr-1356) (22Nguyen L.

Met receptor mutants lacking a Grb2-binding site fail to form branching tubules in response to Met activation (28Fournier T.M. Kamikura D. Teng K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22211-22217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the overexpression of Gab1 in these cells rescues the tubulogenesis defect, thereby implicating Gab1 in modulating the Met-dependent morphogenic program (23Maroun C.

Docking proteins in general contain two distinct domains involved in membrane targeting and interaction with receptor tyrosine kinases. Many docking proteins, including the Gab1 family of proteins, contain an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain with the capacity to bind membrane phospholipids. The Gab1 PH domain preferentially associates with phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (30Maroun C.R. Moscatello D.K. Naujokas M.A. Holgado-Madruga M. Wong A.J. Park M. J. Biol.

In addition, the IRS family, FRS2, and Downstream of Kinases proteins contain a phosphotyrosine-binding domain that acts to target these proteins to specific tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on receptor tyrosine kinases. However, Gab1 lacks an apparent phosphotyrosine-binding domain. Instead, the interaction of Gab1 with Met is thought to occur both indirectly via the Grb2 adapter protein (22Nguyen L.

Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Gab1 is not a substrate unique to the Met receptor but is also phosphorylated downstream from multiple receptor tyrosine kinases including EGF, insulin, and TrkA receptors, cytokine receptors, T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors, and erythropoietin receptor (8Holgado-Madruga M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 37307-37314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanism of recruitment of Gab1 to these receptors is unknown. Interestingly, the association of Gab1 with the EGF receptor requires two tyrosines in the receptor that act as Grb2-binding sites (31Rodrigues G.A. Falasca M. Zhang Z. Ong S.H. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), suggesting that the indirect recruitment of Gab1 via the Grb2 adapter protein may be a common mechanism for Gab1 recruitment to receptor tyrosine kinases. To address this, we have mapped the domain in Gab1 which interacts with the Grb2 SH3 domain. We show that two proline-rich PXXPXR motifs, previously suggested as potential sites of interaction with the Grb2 adapter protein (8Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), are not involved in Grb2 binding. Instead, we have identified two Grb2 SH3 domain binding sites that are conserved in Gab1 and the related protein Gab2. One contains an atypical motif, PXXXR, in which the proline and arginine residues are essential for Grb2 C-terminal SH3 domain binding. This identifies a new interaction motif for the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2-like adapter proteins. We show that a Gab1 mutant that lacks Grb2-binding sites still associates with the Met receptor and rescues the morphogenesis defect of Met receptor mutants, whereas this mutant fails to associate with the EGF receptor. Deletion of proline-rich sites in Gab1 was achieved using the Chameleon Double-stranded Mutagenesis Kit. All mutants were generated in an HA-tagged Gab1-pCDNA1.1 construct. New restriction sites were engineered (or deleted) for identification of mutant clones. Primers used to generate the deletion mutants were (all 5′ to 3′) as follows: ΔPro1/2 (452PNSPPR457 and501PKTPPR506), GAACTACGTTCCCATGAACCAACATTCCGGAAGCTTTACCGAGCC and GCTCATATGGGCTTCAGATCTAGCAGGCCAGTTCTTGTTGC; ΔPro3 (158LPPPY162), GGGAGTCAGATGGAAGCCTCGAGTGTCGCGCAGGTCATCAGCCTTGG; ΔPro4 (337IPDIPPPRPP346), GAGAGCACACTGGGACAGTCATCAAAGCTGGACACCAAGCCACATCCAACTCATGACCGGTCTCCTGTGGAAACG; ΔPro5 (517PPPVDR522), GAGGCCAGTTCCTGTTGCTGACTGTGAAAACCTCAAGCCCGATCGAAAAGTCAAGCCGGCACC; ΔPro6 (566PMSPRP571), GGGACTCCTCTAGGTTTGATTCTGTTCATAGTACGACATCGG. The ΔPro4/5 deletion mutant was generated by subcloning anNdeI-digested fragment of the ΔPro4 mutant containing the desired mutation, into the NdeI site of the ΔPro5 mutant. The generation of the Gab1ΔPH domain mutant was described elsewhere (23Maroun C. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The 6 amino acids deleted in ΔPro5 were individually mutated to alanine in the ΔPro4 mutant construct, and a PvuI restriction site that does not alter the amino acid composition was added for identification of mutant clones. The following primers were used with the Chameleon mutagenesis kit (all 5′ to 3′, mutated codon is underlined, and PvuI site is in italics): P517A, CTGTTGCTGACTGTGAAGCACCCCCTGTCGATCGGAACCTCAAGCCAG; P518A, GTTGCTGACTGTGAACCAGCCCCTGTCGATCGGAACCTCAAGCCAG; P519A, GCTGACTGTGAACCACCCGCTGTCGATCGGAACCTCAAGCCAG; V520A, GACTGTGAACCACCCCCGGCC GATCGGAACCTCAAGCCAG; D521A, GAACCACCCCCGGTGGCTAGGAACCTCAAGCCCGATCGAAAAGTCAAGCCGGCAC; and R522A, GAACCACCCCCGGTGGATGCTAACCTCAAGCCCGATCGAAAAGTCAAGCCGGCAC. The MBD constructs were polymerase chain reaction-amplified out of WT or ΔPro5 Gab1 using oligonucleotides: forward, 5′-ATCGGATATCGGATCCACCGTGGATTTGAACAAGTTG-3′, and reverse, 5′-GCATGGGCCCGAATTCTCACGGCTTGACTTTTCTGTCTGG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into theBamHI/EcoRI sites of both pGEX 2TK and PRK5. All mutants generated were sequenced prior to use. For transient transfections, COS-1 cells were seeded at 8 × 105/100-mm Petri dish and transfected 24 h later with 6 μg of plasmid DNA by a standard DEAE-dextran precipitation method as described previously (40Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 293T cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm Petri dish and transfected 24 h later with 2 μg of DNA by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (41Wigler M. Pellicer A. Silverstein S. Axel R. Urlaub G. Chasin L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1373-1376Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). COS-1 and 293T cells were serum-starved in 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and harvested in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EGTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μg aprotinin/ml, 10 μg leupeptin/ml, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 1 mm sodium vanadate). Following a 10-min incubation on ice, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The generation of MDCK cell lines expressing wild-type colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF)-Met receptor and mutants thereof by retroviral infection have been described previously (15Zhu H.

The generation of stable cell lines expressing WT and mutant HA-tagged Gab1 was described previously (23Maroun C. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Approximately 1/25th of lysate from a 100-mm plate was incubated with the appropriate antibodies for at least 1 h at 4 °C with rocking. Protein A- or G-Sepharose (20 μl of a 50% solution) was added and mixing continued for an additional hour at 4 °C. Following three washes in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) at room temperature and then with the appropriate antibody for at least an additional hour. Following 5 washes in TBST, the proteins were revealed with secondary anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) or protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fusion proteins were produced in the DH5Escherichia coli strain, by induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. GST fusion proteins (0.5–1 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with the indicated amount of 293T cell lysate or approximately 1/20–1/100th of the indicated Cos cell lysate in 0.5% Triton X-100 lysis buffer for at least 2 h at 4 °C with rocking. Bound proteins were washed three times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE as above. For some experiments, the following peptides were added at the indicated concentrations: Pro5 (CEPPPVDRNL); Pro4 (TIPDIPPPRPPKPH); SOS (VPPPVPPRRR); Pro1 (MNPNSPPRQH); Pro5* (PPPVDRNLKPDRKVKPAPLD), Slp-76 (APSIDRSTKPPLDRSLAPLD), and P518A/R522A (PAPVDANLKPDRKVKPAPLD). The peptides were synthesized at the Sheldon Biotechnology Center (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Approximately 400 μg of the indicated lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, run on 8% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was blocked in renaturation buffer (5% dry milk, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2) for at least 6 h. Glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST-Grb2 C-SH3 fusion protein was washed three times with PBS and then eluted two times in 1 ml of 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Approximately 300 μg of eluted fusion protein was added to the renaturation buffer overnight at 4 °C. The membrane was washed extensively and probed for 1 h with anti-GST antibody. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with anti-HA antibody. The ability of MDCK cells to form branching tubules was described previously (27Zhu H. Naujokas M.A. Fixman E.D. Torossian K. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29943-29948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 103 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of collagen solution (Vitrogen 100 (Celtrix)) prepared as specified by the manufacturer and layered over 350 μl of the collagen solution in a 24-well plate. The cells were maintained in Liebowitz medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and allowed to form cysts for 5–7 days, after which HGF or recombinant CSF (rhCSF-1) (15 units/ml) was added to the Liebowitz medium. Tubules were apparent by light microscopy 5–10 days after the addition of stimuli. For quantification of the morphogenic response, 60 colonies in each of six independent cultures (wells) were scored for their ability to form branching tubules (structure whose length is five times their diameter). For microinjection, MDCK cells (5 × 103) were seeded on glass coverslips (Bellco Glass Inc.). Small colonies of 10–50 cells were partially microinjected (Eppendorf). For all experiments, 100–200 cells were microinjected over a 15-min period, and data shown are representative of the results obtained in a minimum of four experiments. Expression vectors (200 μg/ml) were diluted in PBS and co-injected with rabbit immunoglobulin G (Pierce) (2 mg/ml) to mark injected cells. The cells were incubated 2 h to allow for protein expression and further incubated in the presence of HGF (5 units/ml) for an additional 3–4 h before fixation. Antibodies against a carboxyl-terminal peptide of the human Met protein were used (40Rodrigues G.A. Naujokas M.A. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2962-2970Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), as well as DL-21 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY; anti-HA (HA-11) from Babco, Richmond, CA; and anti-Grb2 and anti-GST from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). HA-tagged Gab2 was a gift from Dr. Ben Neel. A GST-Gads fusion protein was provided by Dr. Jane McGlade, and GST-Grap was provided by Dr. Gen-Sheng Feng. Gab1 was originally identified as a Grb2-binding protein from a screen of a glial tumor cDNA library (8Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Grb2 is a small adapter protein comprised of an SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. Gab1 was shown to bind specifically to the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain and not to the amino-terminal SH3 domain (22Nguyen L. Holgado-Madruga M. Maroun C. Fixman E. Kamikura D. Fournier T. Charest A.

SH3 domains bind to proline-rich peptides that adopt a type II, left-handed polyproline helix, characterized by the sequence signature PXXP (42Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D.

Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). To examine whether these sites (452PNSPPR457, and 501PKTPPR506) were involved in binding the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2, we generated a mutant (ΔPro1/2), in which both of these sites were deleted (Fig.1 H). The ability of ΔPro1/2 to associate in vitro with a GST-Grb2 fusion protein was assessed by pull-down assays of Gab1 proteins expressed by transient transfection in COS-1 cells. The ΔPro1/2 mutant associates with a GST-Grb2 protein to similar levels as WT Gab1 (Fig. 1, B, E,and F). Moreover, the ΔPro1/2 mutant co-immunoprecipitates with endogenous Grb2 to the same extent as WT Gab1 (Fig. 1, A, E, and F). Therefore, although the Pro1/2 sites are consensus binding sites for the Grb2 amino-terminal SH3 domain, the Grb2 amino-terminal SH3 domain does not associate with Gab1, and these sites are not required for the association of the carboxyl-termin"
https://openalex.org/W2015004750,"Junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) is an integral membrane protein that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily, localizes at tight junctions, and regulates both paracellular permeability and leukocyte transmigration. To investigate molecular determinants of JAM function, the extracellular domain of murine JAM was produced as a recombinant soluble protein (rsJAM) in insect cells. rsJAM consisted in large part of noncovalent homodimers, as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation. JAM dimers were also detected at the surface of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with murine JAM, as evaluated by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, fluid-phase rsJAM bound dose-dependently solid-phase rsJAM, and such homophilic binding was inhibited by anti-JAM Fab BV11, but not by Fab BV12. Interestingly, Fab BV11 exclusively bound rsJAM dimers (but not monomers) in solution, whereas Fab BV12 bound both dimers and monomers. Finally, we mapped the BV11 and BV12 epitopes to a largely overlapping sequence in proximity of the extracellular amino terminus of JAM.

The difficulty of determining the ion selectivity of this minimalistic ion channel is due in part to the fact that the channel activity is so great that it causes local acidification in the expressing cells and a consequent alteration of reversal voltage, Vrev. We have confirmed the high proton selectivity of the channel (1.5–2.0 × 106) in both oocytes and mammalian cells by using four methods as follows: 1) comparison of Vrev with proton equilibrium potential; 2) measurement of pHin and Vrev while Na+out was replaced; 3) measurements with limiting external buffer concentration to limit proton currents specifically; and 4) comparison of measurements of M2-expressing cells with cells exposed to a protonophore. Increased currents at low pHout are due to true activation and not merely increased [H+]out because increased pHout stops the outward current of acidified cells. Although the proton conductance is the biologically relevant conductance in an influenza virus-infected cell, experiments employing methods 1–3 show that the channel is also capable of conducting NH4+, probably by a different mechanism from H+.

In addition, in influenza virus-infected cells, the M2 protein causes the equilibration of pH between the acidic lumen of the trans-Golgi network and the cytoplasm (reviewed in Refs. 1Hay A.J. Semin.

The mature M2 protein consists of a 23-residue N-terminal extracellular domain, a single internal hydrophobic domain of 19 residues that acts as a transmembrane domain and forms the pore of the channel, and a 54-residue cytoplasmic tail (6Lamb R.A. Zebedee S.L. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1985; 40: 627-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Chemical cross-linking studies showed the M2 protein to exist minimally as a homotetramer (7Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A.

Statistical analysis of the ion channel activity of mixed oligomers also indicated that a homotetramer is the minimal active oligomeric form of the protein (10Sakaguchi T. Tu Q. Pinto L.H. Lamb R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5000-5005Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Despite the small size of the active M2 oligomer, several lines of evidence indicate that ion channel activity is intrinsic to the M2 protein. First, ion channel activity has been observed in three different expression systems, Xenopusoocytes (3Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A.

Second, M2 channel activity has also been recorded in artificial lipid bilayers from a reconstituted peptide corresponding to the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein (15Duff K.C. Ashley R.H. Virology. 1992; 190: 485-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and from purified M2 protein (16Tosteson M.T. Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. J. Membr.

Although a great deal of evidence indicates H+ is the biologically relevant ion for the role of M2 protein in the life cycle of the influenza virus (1Hay A.J. Semin.

Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition, the ion selectivity measured for the M2 channel has been found to differ depending on whether the activity was measured inXenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. When M2protein was expressed in oocytes, Vrev was found to differ from the proton equilibrium potential, E H+ as [H+]out was varied (12Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when M2 protein was expressed in MEL cells, Vrev was found to agree with E H+(5Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 494: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In a recent study (23Mould J.A. Li H.-C. Dudlak C.S. Lear J.D. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8592-8599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we found I H+ of the M2 ion channel to be so large that it was capable of decreasing [H+]out in the locale of the extracellular pore of the channel if the expressing cells were bathed in medium of low buffer concentration. One possible explanation for the different results may be that the channel is also capable of acidifying the interior of some expressing cells, thereby altering reversal voltage, Vrev. Shimbo and co-workers (12Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar) found that replacement of Na+ with Li+ decreased currents, and replacement of Na+ with NH4+ increased currents. In principle, these effects could have resulted from one of two mechanisms. Either these ions affected the proton current, IH+, or the replacing ions permeated the M2 ion channel. In this study, we were able to study the effects of these ion replacements on proton currents specifically by taking advantage of the finding that inward H+ currents are limited when the concentration of buffer in the bathing medium is reduced (23Mould J.A. Li H.-C. Dudlak C.S. Lear J.D. Pekosz A. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8592-8599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) to distinguish between these possibilities. The M2 ion channel current is increased in amplitude when the pH of the extracellular domain is lowered (3Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar, 5Chizhmakov I.V. Geraghty F.M. Ogden D.C. Hayhurst A. Antoniou M. Hay A.J. J. Physiol.

This increase in current occurs within the range of pH values expected for titration of histidine (24Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The only amino acid in the transmembrane domain of the M2 protein with a titratable group in this pH range is His37, and when His37 is replaced by Ala, Gly, or Glu, the proton selectivity of the channel is greatly reduced, and the channel is conductive over a wider range of pH (3Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar,24Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 1363-1371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that His37 forms a selectivity filter for protons and that H+ conduction may occur by tautomerization of the imidazole side chain of His37 (25Pinto L.H. Dieckmann G.R. Gandhi C.S. Shaughnessy M.A. Papworth C.G. Braman J. Lear J.D. Lamb R.A. DeGrado W.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11301-11306Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although the H+ current of the M2 ion channel protein is increased by elevated [H+] in the extracellular medium, this increased current may be due to either the increased abundance of the conducting species or activation of the channel at low pH, or both factors operating together. One way to distinguish pH-dependent changes in activity from the effects of increased abundance of H+ at low pH is to compare the efflux of H+ from acidified cells that express the M2 protein to the efflux from acidified cells treated with the electrogenic protonophore FCCP.1 Cell acidification can be achieved by lowering the pH of the medium bathing M2-expressing or FCCP-treated cells. If the M2ion channel is indeed activated by low pHout and conversely deactivated by neutral or alkaline pHout, then the efflux of H+ should be greater for FCCP-treated cells than for M2-expressing cells upon return to a bathing solution of neutral or alkaline pH. In this study we measured ionic currents and pHin in two M2 expression systems to ensure that the results obtained were not specific to the cell type. The results demonstrate that under normal physiological conditions the M2 ion channel specifically conducts H+. We also demonstrate that NH4+ can permeate the channel, by a mechanism that differs from that for H+ permeation. Furthermore, by comparison of the outward currents of acidified, M2-expressing cells and FCCP-treated cells, we confirm that M2 ion channel activity is modulated by the pH of the solution bathing the extracellular N-terminal domain of the channel. The cDNA to the A/Udorn/72 mRNA was cloned into the BamHI site of pGEM3 such that mRNA sense transcripts could be generated by using the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter and T7 RNA polymerase. For in vitrotranscription, plasmid DNAs were linearized downstream of the T7 promoter and the M2 cDNA with XbaI. In vitro synthesis and quantification of7mG(5′)ppp(5′)G-capped mRNA was carried out as described previously (3Pinto L.H. Holsinger L.J. Lamb R.A. Cell. 1992; 69: 517-528Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Oocytes were removed from female Xenopus laevis (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI), defolliculated by treatment with collagenase B (2 mg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and incubated in ND96 (96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 3.6 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm pyruvic acid, 5 mg/ml gentamicin, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, osmolality ∼210 mosmol/kg) at 19 °C. Oocytes at stage V were microinjected with 50 nl of mRNA (1 ng/nl) on the day after defolliculation, incubated for 24 h in ND96, pH 7.5, and finally incubated for 24 h in ND96, pH 8.5, at 19 °C before use. CV-1 cells were cultured and infected with recombinant simian virus 40 expressing the M2 protein from influenza A/Udorn/72 (rSV40-M2), as described previously (13Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, CV-1 cells grown to confluency at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in culture media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum + penicillin + streptomycin) were trypsinized, pelleted, and resuspended in culture medium. Resuspended cells were incubated in the presence of high titer SV40-M2 (100 μl of resuspended CV-1 cells + 1 ml of virus stock) for 4 h. Infected cells were then diluted 1:1 in culture medium and seeded onto 5-mm square glass coverslips arranged in 3.5-cm Petri dishes (2 ml total volume/dish). Infected cells were then incubated for 48 h before recording to ensure adequate M2 protein expression. M2 currents were recorded from CV-1 cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique as described previously (13Wang C. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Virology. 1994; 205: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Briefly, patch pipettes having tip diameters of ∼2–3 μm were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass, fire-polished, and then partially filled with pipette solution which contained, in mm, 145 KCl, 5 EGTA, 1 MgCl2, 5 NaCl, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH, osmolality 300–310 mosmol/Kg. Pipettes filled with this solution typically had resistances of ∼3–4 MΩ. CV-1 cells attached to glass coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber filled with a solution that contained, in mm, 140 NaCl, 5.3 KCl, 0.55 MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 glucose, 15 HEPES, pH 7.4, or 15 mm MES, pH 6.2, osmolality ∼300 mosmol/kg. Seals (in excess of 10 GΩ) were made by gently pressing the patch pipette against a CV-1 cell and then applying ∼12 mm Hg suction without delay. The whole cell configuration was achieved by using a brief pulse of high voltage combined with gentle pipette suction. In the whole cell configuration, cells had access resistances of <10 MΩ. Cells were generally bathed in pH 7.4 solution and held at −20 mV. Whole cell currents were recorded after the bathing solution was changed from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2 using a Fast Step Perfusion System (model SF77B, Warner Instruments Corp., Hamden, CT). By using this system, solution changes could be made in less than 100 ms. M2-specific currents were identified by sensitivity to block by 100 μmamantadine. Whole cell currents were measured using a two-electrode voltage clamp. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and the oocytes were bathed in either Barth's solution, which contained, in mm, 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.3 NaNO3, 0.71 CaCl2, 0.82 MgSO4, 15 HEPES, pH 7.5, osmolality ∼210 mosmol/kg or a modified solution during the recording. Continuous current-voltage (I-V) relationships were measured with ramps of membrane voltage since the M2 channel shows no rapid voltage- or time-dependent gating. These ramps typically spanned a range of 120 mV in 2 s. Oocyte holding potential was −20 mV unless stated otherwise. Microelectrodes were silanized and filled with protonophore as described previously (12Shimbo K. Brassard D.L. Lamb R.A. Pinto L.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1336-1346Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The electrodes were calibrated before each experiment with four pH values spanning the range encountered during the experiment. The response time of these electrodes, determined with a stepping motor device that changed solution pH within 100 ms, was less than 10 ms. We used the fluorometric indicator 2′,7′-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM) tο measure pHin. Control cells or cells infected with rSV40-M2 were incubated (37 °C for 1 h) in a solution containing BCECF-AM in 0.25% Me2SO carrier with a final dye concentration of 0.25 μg/ml. These cells were placed on the stage of an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a × 20, 0.75 NA (Nikon) objective that allowed up to seven CV-1 cells to be imaged in its field at one time, an intensified CCD camera and MagiCal image analysis software (Applied Imaging, Sunderland, UK). The dye was excited with 490 nm illumination to observe pH-induced changes in fluorescence. To measure the intracellular concentration of dye and thus allow calibration of pHin of the CV-1 cells, illumination was applied at 435 nm (the isosbestic wavelength) at the beginning and end of the measurements from one field of cells. Emission was recorded at 520 nm. Calibration of the pHin from fluorescence measurements was done using the FCCP equilibration method (26James-Kracke M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were treated with the protonophore FCCP to allow equilibration of the [H+] across the plasma membrane. The emission at 520 nm as a result of excitation at 490 and 435 nm was measured while the cell was bathed in solutions with pH spanning the range of pH values expected to be encountered during the measurements (pH 4.0, pH 6.7, and pH 9.0), and the resulting ratios (F 490/F 435) were used to construct a calibration curve (see Equation 1 of Ref. 26James-Kracke M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 151: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The M2 protein from influenza A/Udorn/72 virus was used for this study. If the M2 ion channel is highly proton-selective, then the reversal voltage of the current (Vrev) should change according to the equilibrium potential for H+ (E H+) when the difference between pHin and pHout is altered. The reversal voltage of the currents of cells expressing the M2 protein can be measured from continuous current-voltage relationships measured with ramps of membrane voltage because the M2 ion channel is not voltage-activated on the time scale of the ramps of voltage that are practical to use. We measured the Vrev of amantadine-sensitive currents in M2-expressingXenopus oocytes at 20-s intervals using two-microelectrode voltage clamp. Oocytes whose membrane voltage was clamped to −20 mV produced a large amantadine-sensitive inward current (∼1 μA) when the pH of the bathing solution was lowered from pH 8.5 to pH 5.8 (Fig.1 A). During the time when the oocyte was bathed in low pH medium, Vrev, measured using voltage ramps, became more positive within a few seconds and reached a maximum prior to the time when the inward current reached its maximum amplitude (Fig. 1 B). The average peak Vrev, calculated from the current-voltage relationship of the amantadine-sensitive current, was 51.4 ± 1.22 mV S.E. (n = 34), a value more negative than that forE H+ (85.2 mV ± 1.86 mV S.E.,n = 34) which was calculated from the known pHout and the value of pHin measured with a pH microelectrode at the beginning of the experiment. We calculated the permeability of H+ relative to that for Na+assuming 20 mm intracellular Na+ concentration for these 34 cells, using the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) equation, and we found that the relative permeability was about 1.5 × 106. However, in two cells that had small amantadine-sensitive currents, the peak Vrev nearly reached the value calculated for E H+ (+89 and +91 mV). At the time when the peak value of Vrev occurred, the current-voltage relationship was steeper than that obtained at pH 8.5, indicating that the conductance had increased. Shortly after reaching its peak value, the inward current decreased in amplitude over a period of a few minutes (Fig. 1 A). The current decrease was accompanied by a return of Vrev back toward more negative potentials. The membrane currents and Vrev were measured using the whole cell patch clamp technique in CV-1 cells that expressed the M2 protein (Fig.2), whereas pHout was reduced in less than 100 ms from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2 with a stepping-motor device (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pHin of CV-1 cells, measured fluorimetrically in a separate experiment described below, was used to calculate E H+. The peak Vrev measured in a solution of pH 6.2 was 41.8 ± 3.5 mV S.E. (n = 12), and E H+ was 38.9 ± 4.7 mV S.E. (n = 13). In less than 1 min after lowering pH of the bathing solution, Vrev reached a peak near E H+ and then returned to more negative values (Fig. 2). We calculated the permeability of H+relative to that for Na+ assuming 2 mm residual intracellular Na+ concentration for these CV-1 cells, using the GHK equation, and found that the relative permeability was about 1.8 × 106.Figure 2Current-voltage relationships recorded from a CV-1 cell expressing the M2 protein at pH 7.4 at various times (numerals above curves) after the pH of the bathing medium was lowered from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2. Note that the return of Vrev to more negative values and the increase in conductance that occurred with time in low pH bathing medium were faster than those measured in oocytes (Fig. 1 B).E H+ (vertical interrupted line) was calculated from the known pHout and the pHinwas measured fluorometrically in separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since Vrev changed after reaching a peak in the low pH solutions in a rapid and systematic manner in both M2-expressing CV-1 cells and oocytes, we studied the reason for the systematic changes in Vrev, and we employed other means to study the ion selectivity of the channel. There are a number of possible explanations for the decrease of inward current and the return of Vrev to more negative voltages after reaching a peak value that was observed in M2-expressing cells bathed in low pH solutions. 1) The influx of ions through the M2channel could activate an endogenous outward current that opposes the current flowing through the M2 channel. 2) The M2 ion channel might undergo an activity dependent change in ion selectivity. 3) The M2 ion channel might inactivate after long periods in low pH solutions. 4) A constant influx of protons through the M2 channel might cause acidification of the cell cytoplasm and thus decrease the driving force on protons. For explanations 1 and 2, the possibility was tested that the shift in Vrev observed in oocytes and CV-1 cells might be due to activation of an amantadine-insensitive, endogenous current or an activity-dependent change in ion selectivity by measuring currents under ionic conditions chosen to minimize all but H+ currents. The experiments were conducted in CV-1 cells, for which it was possible to control the composition of both the intracellular and extracellular solutions. We found that it was not possible to perform these experiments by changing the internal composition in oocytes using the cut-open technique because small leaks that developed were indistinguishable from M2 currents, except by application of amantadine, the effects of which are not reversible on the time scale of these experiments. The principal endogenous currents of CV-1 cells were found to be similar to those of HEK293 cells, i.e. inward Cl− and outward K+ currents (27Zhu G. Zhang Y. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1998; 81: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Whole cell currents were measured in CV-1 cells when Cl− in the bathing solution was replaced with methane sulfonate and KCl in the pipette solution with tetraethylammonium chloride in order to reduce the endogenous currents of the cells. As before, Vrev was measured at frequent intervals as the external pH was lowered. Upon lowering the extracellular pH from pH 7.4 to pH 6.2, a large inward current developed in M2-expressing CV-1 cells held at −20 mV, similar to the results obtained with control solutions (Fig. 2). This inward current was accompanied by a shift of Vrev to positive values. The peak Vrev (38.8 ± 2.01 mV S.E.,n = 5) was close to the value ofE H+ (calculated as above, 38.9 ± 4.7 mV S.E., n = 13). As observed in the control solution, the inward current began to decrease a few seconds after reaching its maximum amplitude. The decrease of inward current was again accompanied by a return of Vrev to more negative voltages and an increase in the slope conductance of the I-V relationship. The fact that the return of Vrev to negative values still occurred in the absence of other conducting ions suggests that the change of Vrev was not the result of either activating an endogenous current or an activity-dependent change in ion selectivity. We calculated the permeability of H+ relative to that for Na+ using the mean values of 38.8 and 38.9 mV for the Vrev and E H+, respectively, and assuming 2 mm residual intracellular Na+concentration for these CV-1 cells, using the GHK equation, and we found that the relative permeability was about 2 × 107. However, if the actual values differed by as little as 3 mm, the relative permeability would have been about 2 × 106. For explanation 3, it was also unlikely that the decrease of current and negative shift of Vrev observed in low pH was the result of inactivation of the M2 ion channel. This is because the slope conductance of the I-V relationship actuallyincreased in both oocytes and CV-1 cells during the shift (Figs. 1 B and 2). This observation is the opposite of what would have been expected if the channel had been inactivating. The remaining and most likely explanation for the return of Vrev to more negative values for cells bathed in low pH solutions was that intracellular acidification occurred. For explanation 4, we tested whether the return of Vrev to negative potentials and the decrease in amplitude of the inward current observed after their peak values occurred were the result of cell acidification by measuring the shift under conditions designed to minimize acidification. These conditions were achieved as discussed in the following two paragraphs. If the return of Vrev to more negative values is due to acidification, then a larger negative shift should be observed when there is a larger inward driving force on H+. This can be obtained either by lowering the pH of the bathing solution further or by making the holding voltage still more negative thanE H+. Since most cells become unstable in very low pH solutions (<pH 5.5), we decided to modulate the size of the inward current of oocytes by varying the cell holding voltage while the cells were bathed in Barth's solution of pH 5.8 (Fig.3). Holding oocytes at voltages more negative than −20 mV produced larger inward currents, accelerated the onset and rate of current decrease, and resulted in a faster rate of negative shift of Vrev over time (Fig. 3 A). It was also found that Vrev could be directed to more positive values following the shift in Vrev in low external pH by making the holding voltage more positive (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, the return of Vrev to negative values could be prevented by holding membrane voltage at a large positive value that was close to E H+ (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that Vrev can be manipulated by holding voltage, consistent with the current that flows at the holding voltage being capable of altering pHin of the cell. To minimize the acidification of M2-expressing cells in low pH solutions, the intracellular buffer concentration was increased. Again, as the ionic composition of the ooplasm could not be controlled, this experiment was performed in M2-expressing CV-1 cells using the whole cell patch clamp technique. We studied the effect of elevated concentrations of the buffer of the pipette solution. The results obtained from pipettes containing 15 and 120 mmHEPES buffer on Vrev and the amplitude of t"

Here we report the isolation of a novel splice variant of CCK-BR that exhibits constitutive (ligand-independent) activation of pathways regulating intracellular free Ca2+([Ca2+]i) and cell growth. The splice variant (designated CCK-BRi4sv for intron 4-containing splice variant) is expressed in colorectal cancers but not in normal colonic mucosa adjacent to the cancer. Balb3T3 cells expressing CCK-BRi4sv exhibited spontaneous, ligand-independent, oscillatory increases in [Ca2+]i, whereas cells expressing wild-type CCK-BR did not. Primary cultures of cells isolated from resected colorectal cancers also exhibited a similar pattern of spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. For both Balb3T3 and primary tumor cells, application of G-17 (10 and 200 nm, respectively) caused an increase in [Ca2+]i. Selective CCK-BR antagonists blocked the G-17-stimulated Ca2+ responses but not the spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. Cells expressing CCK-BRi4sv exhibited an increased growth rate (∼2.5-fold), in the absence of G-17, compared with cells expressing wild-type CCK-BR.

Most colorectal cancers and derived cell lines produce amidated G-17 and/or G-Gly (26Baldwin G.S. Casey A. Mantamadiotis T. McBride K. Sizeland A.M. Thumwood C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Also, many colorectal cancers exhibit a proliferative response upon application of exogenous peptides. Together these observations have led to the hypothesis that G-17 and its non-amidated precursors act as autocrine and/or paracrine growth factors to stimulate colorectal cancer cell proliferation. In this model, G-17 and/or G-Gly are released from cancer cells into the interstitium where they bind to specific cell-surface receptors on the same or adjacent cells and stimulate proliferation (18Todisco A. Takeuchi Y. Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we have reported the isolation and partial characterization of a novel splice variant of CCK-BR, designated CCK-BRi4sv, that stimulates cell growth in a G-17-independent manner. Our data show that colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps, but not the normal colonic mucosa, express CCK-BRi4sv and that cells expressing this receptor exhibit spontaneous, oscillatory increases in [Ca2+]i in the absence of agonist stimulation.The constitutive, ligand independent activation of pathways regulating [Ca2+]i and cell proliferation exhibited by CCK-BRi4sv may contribute to its potential pathophysiological role in colorectal cancers. Recently, other GPCRs exhibiting constitutive activation of intracellular signaling pathways have been identified as causative factors in several human diseases including some cancers (28Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar,29Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a GPCR, with homology to the human interleukin-8 receptor, which constitutively activates the IP3/[Ca2+]i pathway and, when transfected into rat NRK-49F cells, increases their rate of growth in the absence of agonist stimulation (29Arvanitakis L. Geras-Raaka E. Varma A. Gershengorn M.C. Cesarman E. Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). We have shown that CCK-BRi4sv* can stimulate the rate of cell growth in the absence of agonist stimulation which suggests that, like Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, constitutive action of the IP3dependent/[Ca2+]i pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Several other G protein-coupled receptors that signal through Gαq/IP3/[Ca2+]i pathway have been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis and induce a transformed-like phenotype in fibroblasts. These include the serotonin 1c, muscarinic acetylcholine m1, m3, and m5, and the α1b-adrenergic receptors (30Julius D. Livelli T.J. Jessell T.M. Axel R.

However, unlike CCK-BRi4sv and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, the stimulation of DNA synthesis and transformation, by these other receptors, required the continued presence of agonist.Various types of reconstitution studies and experiments with natural membrane systems have shown that GPCRs can spontaneously activate G proteins in the absence of agonist (34Senogles S.E. Spiegel A.M. Padrell E. Iyengar R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4507-4514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Munshi R. Pang I.H. Sternweis P.C. Linden J. J. Biol.

Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) as an extension of the well known ternary complex model of receptor-effector interactions. In this model, a receptor, in the absence of ligand, can exist in so-called inactive (Ri) and active (Ra) states with respect to its predisposition to associate spontaneously with G protein. The activated receptor (Ra) can spontaneously form a complex with G protein (Ra·G protein). Our data support the hypothesis that the structural alterations associated with the addition of 69 amino acid residues to the third intracellular loop domain of CCK-BRi4sv cause it to favor the Ra conformation and, therefore, increase its predisposition to spontaneous coupling to G protein. The consequences of the increased spontaneous coupling to G protein is reflected by the transient elevations in [Ca2+]i. Another important aspect of this model, which is also supported by our data, is that an agonist has two different binding states of the receptor to choose from, namely Ri and Ra (and Ra·G protein). CCK-BRi4sv* expressed in Balb3T3 cells clearly exhibits two binding states for G-17. Additionally, this model predicts that a ligand that destabilizes Ra·G protein will act as an inverse agonist and inhibit spontaneous signaling by the receptor. Inverse agonists for CCK-BRi4sv could prove to be useful therapeutic agents.The similarities in both the pattern and pharmacology of the [Ca2+]i responses observed in Balb3T3 cells transfected with CCK-BRi4sv* and primary cultures of collagenase-dissociated colorectal cancer cells strongly suggest that CCK-BRi4sv is the mediator of the response in the latter. Although the identification of CCK-BRi4sv does not preclude the existence of other G-17/G-Gly receptors on human colorectal cancers, its selective pattern of expression, constitutive (ligand-independent) activity, and growth-promoting effects provides compelling evidence for a significant role of CCK-BRi4sv in colorectal carcinogenesis. The unique properties of CCK-BRi4sv suggest that it may stimulate colorectal cancer cell proliferation though a gastrin-independent mechanism and make it an attractive target for the development of novel drugs such as inverse agonists, which, in the future, may provide more effective adjuvant therapies for this devastating disease.

The human Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus encodes a GPCR, with homology to the human interleukin-8 receptor, which constitutively activates the IP3/[Ca2+]i pathway and, when transfected into rat NRK-49F cells, increases their rate of growth in the absence of agonist stimulation (29Arvanitakis L.

We have shown that CCK-BRi4sv* can stimulate the rate of cell growth in the absence of agonist stimulation which suggests that, like Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, constitutive action of the IP3dependent/[Ca2+]i pathway may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. Several other G protein-coupled receptors that signal through Gαq/IP3/[Ca2+]i pathway have been shown to stimulate DNA synthesis and induce a transformed-like phenotype in fibroblasts. These include the serotonin 1c, muscarinic acetylcholine m1, m3, and m5, and the α1b-adrenergic receptors (30Julius D. Livelli T.J. Jessell T.M. Axel R.

However, unlike CCK-BRi4sv and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, the stimulation of DNA synthesis and transformation, by these other receptors, required the continued presence of agonist.Various types of reconstitution studies and experiments with natural membrane systems have shown that GPCRs can spontaneously activate G proteins in the absence of agonist (34Senogles S.E.

Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) as an extension of the well known ternary complex model of receptor-effector interactions. In this model, a receptor, in the absence of ligand, can exist in so-called inactive (Ri) and active (Ra) states with respect to its predisposition to associate spontaneously with G protein. The activated receptor (Ra) can spontaneously form a complex with G protein (Ra·G protein). Our data support the hypothesis that the structural alterations associated with the addition of 69 amino acid residues to the third intracellular loop domain of CCK-BRi4sv cause it to favor the Ra conformation and, therefore, increase its predisposition to spontaneous coupling to G protein. The consequences of the increased spontaneous coupling to G protein is reflected by the transient elevations in [Ca2+]i. Another important aspect of this model, which is also supported by our data, is that an agonist has two different binding states of the receptor to choose from, namely Ri and Ra (and Ra·G protein). CCK-BRi4sv* expressed in Balb3T3 cells clearly exhibits two binding states for G-17. Additionally, this model predicts that a ligand that destabilizes Ra·G protein will act as an inverse agonist and inhibit spontaneous signaling by the receptor. Inverse agonists for CCK-BRi4sv could prove to be useful therapeutic agents.The similarities in both the pattern and pharmacology of the [Ca2+]i responses observed in Balb3T3 cells transfected with CCK-BRi4sv* and primary cultures of collagenase-dissociated colorectal cancer cells strongly suggest that CCK-BRi4sv is the mediator of the response in the latter. Although the identification of CCK-BRi4sv does not preclude the existence of other G-17/G-Gly receptors on human colorectal cancers, its selective pattern of expression, constitutive (ligand-independent) activity, and growth-promoting effects provides compelling evidence for a significant role of CCK-BRi4sv in colorectal carcinogenesis. The unique properties of CCK-BRi4sv suggest that it may stimulate colorectal cancer cell proliferation though a gastrin-independent mechanism and make it an attractive target for the development of novel drugs such as inverse agonists, which, in the future, may provide more effective adjuvant therapies for this devastating disease. The possibility that the gastrointestinal peptide hormone, gastrin, and it biosynthetic precursor, G-Gly, play a role in the development of colorectal cancers has aroused considerable interest over the past several years. Most colorectal cancers and derived cell lines produce amidated G-17 and/or G-Gly (26Baldwin G.S. Casey A. Mantamadiotis T. McBride K. Sizeland A.M. Thumwood C.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Rehfeld J.F. Bardram L. Blanke S. Bundgaard J.R. Friis-Hansen L. Hilsted L. Johnsen A.H. Kofod M. Luttichau H.R. Monstein H.J.

Also, many colorectal cancers exhibit a proliferative response upon application of exogenous peptides. Together these observations have led to the hypothesis that G-17 and its non-amidated precursors act as autocrine and/or paracrine growth factors to stimulate colorectal cancer cell proliferation. In this model, G-17 and/or G-Gly are released from cancer cells into the interstitium where they bind to specific cell-surface receptors on the same or adjacent cells and stimulate proliferation (18Todisco A. Takeuchi Y. Seva C. Dickinson C.J. Yamada T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28337-28341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we have reported the isolation and partial characterization of a novel splice variant of CCK-BR, designated CCK-BRi4sv, that stimulates cell growth in a G-17-independent manner. Our data show that colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps, but not the normal colonic mucosa, express CCK-BRi4sv and that cells expressing this receptor exhibit spontaneous, oscillatory increases in [Ca2+]i in the absence of agonist stimulation. The constitutive, ligand independent activation of pathways regulating [Ca2+]i and cell proliferation exhibited by CCK-BRi4sv may contribute to its potential pathophysiological role in colorectal cancers. Recently, other GPCRs exhibiting constitutive activation of intracellular signaling pathways have been identified as causative factors in several human diseases including some cancers (28Dhanasekaran N.

In light of this, we sought to use an established mouse hepatocyte cell line, H2-35, to further define the mechanism by which glucose regulates nuclear SREBP-1 levels. First, we show that these cells transcribe high levels of SREBP-1c that are increased 4-fold upon differentiation from a prehepatocyte to a hepatocyte phenotype, making them an ideal cell culture model for the study of SREBP-1c induction. Second, we demonstrate that the presence of precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1 protein are positively regulated by medium glucose concentrations ranging from 5.5 to 25 mm and are also regulated by insulin, with the amount of insulin in the fetal bovine serum being sufficient for maximal stimulation of SREBP-1 expression. Third, we show that the increase in SREBP-1 protein is due to an increase in SREBP-1 mRNA. Reporter gene analysis of the SREBP-1c promoter demonstrated a glucose-dependent induction of transcription. In contrast, expression of a fixed amount of the precursor form of SREBP-1c protein showed that glucose does not influence its cleavage. Fourth, we demonstrate that the glucose induction of SREBP could not be reproduced by fructose, xylose, or galactose nor by glucose analogs 2-deoxy glucose and 3-O-methyl glucopyranose. These data provide strong evidence for the induction of SREBP-1c mRNA by glucose leading to increased mature protein in the nucleus, thus providing a potential mechanism for the up-regulation of lipogenic genes by glucosein vivo.

Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar). In contrast to other members of this, SREBPs are synthesized as ∼1150-amino acid precursor proteins that remain bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope in the presence of sufficient sterol concentrations. Upon sterol deprivation, the precursor protein undergoes a sequential two-step cleavage process to release the NH2-terminal portion (3Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

This NH2-terminal, mature SREBP then enters the nucleus and activates the transcription of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis by binding to sterol regulatory elements or to palindromic sequences called E-boxes within their promoter regions (4Wang X.

Currently, there are three forms of SREBP that have been characterized. SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from a single gene through the use of alternate promoters that give rise to different first exons (2Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3029) Google Scholar), and SREBP-1a is the more common isoform found in cultured cells and is a stronger activator of transcription than SREBP-1c because of a longer transactivating domain (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Transgenic mouse studies have shown that SREBP-1 plays a more active role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis than those involved in cholesterol synthesis (15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). SREBP-2 is derived from a different gene and is known to be actively involved in the transcription of cholesterogenic enzymes. It has been shown that all cultured cells analyzed to date exclusively express SREBP-2 and the -1a isoform of SREBP-1, whereas most organs, including the liver, express predominantly SREBP-2 and the -1c isoform of SREBP-1 (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). It is known that both glucose and insulin are required for the production of fatty acids via the induction of lipogenic enzymes. The precise roles of glucose and insulin in this action are not known; however, it has been shown that glucose must be metabolized for this effect and that insulin is only permissive to glucose action (16Mourrieras F. Foufelle F. Foretz M. Morin J. Bouche S. Ferre P. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 345-349Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Doiron B. Cuif M.H. Kahn A. Diaz-Guerra M.J. J. Biol.

In support of a role for SREBP-1 in the induction of lipogenic genes by insulin, several different groups have shown through various lines of evidence that SREBP-1c is up-regulated by insulin in vivoand in primary hepatocyte cultures and that the induction of lipogenic enzymes corresponds to the increased concentration of SREBP-1c within a relatively short time period (approximately 6 h) (18Kim J.B.

Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). With respect to the influence of glucose on SREBP-1 expression, it has been shown that glucose does not induce SREBP-1 expression after a 6-h incubation (22Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C. LeLiepvre X. Berthelier-Lubrano C. Spiegelman B. Kim J. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3760-3768Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar); however, a later study showed that two lipogenic enzymes, FAS and S14, can be induced by glucose even in the absence of insulin after a 16-h incubation (19Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Therefore, it remains possible that glucose can increase SREBP-1 expression, leading to the induction of lipogenic genes, and that this occurs after a longer period of time than the induction caused by addition of insulin. Lipogenic enzymes, including FAS and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, are a group of genes involved in energy storage through fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (23Towle H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23235-23238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 24Goodridge A.G. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 157-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Excess amounts of carbohydrates taken up by cells are converted to triglycerides through these enzymes in lipogenic organs such as liver and adipose tissue. The lipogenic enzymes are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level during different metabolic states (23Towle H.C. J. Biol.

Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that SREBP-1 plays a crucial role in the dietary regulation of most hepatic lipogenic genes. These include studies of the effects of the absence or over-expression of SREBP-1 on hepatic lipogenic gene expression (25Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M. Goldstein J.L. J.

The fuel metabolism in these nutritionally challenged mice involves a time-dependent, multi-organ, complex milieu of metabolites and hormones. To dissect the molecular mechanism by which nutritional change regulates those metabolic genes, it is important to establish anin vitro cultured cell system to model these in vivo conditions. The mouse hepatic cell line H2-35 was originally developed to induce liver-specific gene transcription in a temperature-sensitive manner by transformation with a temperature-sensitive strain of SV40 (33Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Upon inducing cell differentiation by increasing the incubation temperature from 33 to 39 °C, mRNA levels for hepatic genes such as albumin, SCD-1, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 3-α were found to be increased by as much as 100-fold (33Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Ntambi J.M. Sessler A.M. Takova T. Biochem.

Biol. 1991; 11: 4405-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SCD levels were also found to be regulated by both insulin and glucose in this cell line (34Ntambi J.M. Sessler A.M. Takova T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the current study, these H2-35 cells were used as an in vitro model of differentiated hepatocytes to analyze the glucose induction of SREBP-1 expression. H2-35 cells were initially characterized to compare expression levels of SREBP-1a and -1c. In contrast to other hepatic cell lines, H2-35 cells expressed significant amounts of SREBP-1c. It was found that both SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are up-regulated in a dose-dependent manner by the presence of excess glucose in the medium, with the -1c isoform being more strongly up-regulated than the -1a isoform. The induction is primarily at the level of transcription and results in an increase of the membrane and nuclear forms of SREBP-1. This glucose-induced up-regulation of SREBP-1 in H2-35 cells cannot be achieved by other monosaccharides or glucose analogs but can be inhibited by both azaserine, a glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate (GFAT) inhibitor, and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, Ly294002. Calpain inhibitor (ALLN) and Ly294002 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). BSA, protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin),l-glucose, fructose, 2-deoxy glucose, 3-O-methyl glucopyranose, mannitol, galactose, xylose, dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP), forskolin, and azaserine were purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), low glucose (5.5 mm, LG), and high glucose (25 mm, HG) media were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Both rabbit and mouse secondary antibodies for immunoblotting were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Delipidated serum (DLS) was prepared from fetal calf serum as described previously (36Hasan M.T. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 183-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were performed as described (37Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were regularly passaged in high glucose Dulbecco's minimally modified medium (DMEM) with dexamethasone at 33 °C. 24 h prior to treatment, the cells were split into new dishes and placed at 39 °C to initiate differentiation. Cells were washed with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline and then placed in treatment medium for 3–24 h (all experiments were performed after a 24-h incubation with the exception of the time course experiments). 2 h prior to collection, ALLN (1.25 μg/ml) was added to the cells. After collection, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing ALLN and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA). Pellets were passed through a 22 gauge needle 10 times and then briefly centrifuged. The pellet, containing the nuclei, was resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) rotated at 4 °C and then prepared for electrophoresis by addition of SDS loading buffer and boiling. The supernatant was centrifuged at 55,000 rpm, and the remaining membrane-containing pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris HCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 80 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100. All buffers used contained a mixture of protease inhibitors containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and aprotinin. A small portion of each sample was removed and analyzed for protein content by a BCA reaction (Pierce). Samples (50 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Hybond ECL membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Prior to immunoblotting, membranes were stained with Ponceau S stain (Sigma) to verify equal loading of proteins. Monoclonal antibody for mouse SREBP-1, 2A4, was prepared from a hybrid cell line purchased from American Type Culture Collection. Polyclonal antibody specific for mouse SREBP-1c and SREBP-2 were prepared as described in Refs. 31Yahagi N. Shimano H. Hasty A. Amemiya-Kudo M. Okazaki H. Tamura Y. Iizuka Y. Shionoiri F. Ohashi K.

All other blots were probed with the monoclonal 2A4 antibody for discrimination between the 1a and 1c isoforms unless otherwise indicated. Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or -rabbit, and detection of immunoreactive bands was performed using the ECL kit by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total RNA was prepared from the cells with TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA was electrophoresed through formalin-denatured gels and transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The cDNA probes for SREBP-1, FAS, SCD, ACL, and 36B4 were prepared as described previously (25Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using Megaprime DNA Labeling System kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were hybridized with the radiolabeled probes in Rapid-hyb Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Membranes were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film for 2–5 h at −80 °C. RNA was isolated from H2-35 and HepG2 cells cultured in either low glucose or high glucose DMEM using the TRIzol reagent by Life Technologies, Inc. RNase protection assays were performed with the same probes and conditions as described previously (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin.

A reporter gene containing mouse SREBP-1c promoter (a 2.6-kilobaseBamHI-AvrII fragment from the mouse SREBP-1 genomic clone) (26Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

These constructs (purified with Qiagen maxi DNA preparation kit) were individually co-transfected with a neomycin resistance-containing vector (pMAMneo, fromCLONTECH) into H2-35 cells using Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Empty pGL2 vector was also co-transfected with pMAMneo to be used as controls for the luciferase assays. TK-HSV-SREBP-1c, an expression vector of human SREBP-1c precursor with an HSV-Tag at the amino terminus under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter, was constructed as described previously (37Hua X. Sakai J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10379-10384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transfected cell clones were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Luciferase assay reagent (Promega) was added to lysed cell samples and luciferase activity was detected using the Microplate Luminometer LB 96V by EG&G Berthold (Germany) and analyzed with Winglow software. All cultured cells analyzed to date express almost exclusively the 1a isoform of SREBP-1, whereas most organs, including liver, predominantly express the 1c isoform (14Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). In the current studies, H2-35 cells, a well differentiated mouse hepatocyte cell line (33Zaret K.S. DiPersio C.M. Jackson D.A. Montigny W.J. Weinstat D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9076-9080Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), were evaluated to determine levels of SREBP-1c expression by RNase protection assays. Interestingly, when H2-35 cells were cultured at the differentiation temperature of 39 °C in high glucose (25 mm) media, they expressed high levels of the 1c isoform as well as the 1a isoform, whereas barely detectable levels of the 1c isoform were found in HepG2 cells (data not shown). In addition, the use of a polyclonal antibody that specifically recognizes SREBP-1c and a monoclonal antibody for both the 1c and 1a isoforms demonstrated that the 1c isoform is highly expressed at the protein level as well (Fig.1). This is then the first report of a liver cell line in which SREBP-1c is expressed at levels comparable with SREBP-1a and is therefore an appropriate cell culture model for the study of SREBP-1c regulation in the liver. To determine the pattern of sterol regulation of SREBP-1 and -2 in H2-35 cells, both H2-35 and 293 cells (nonhepatocytes) were depleted of cholesterol and/or fatty acids and assayed for SREBP levels. When cells were provided with cholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol (OH) (20 and 2 μg/ml, respectively), the mature form of SREBP-2 was nearly abolished in both H2-35 and 293 cells. In comparison, SREBP-1 was only moderately reduced (Fig. 2, compare lanes 1 and 2). Interestingly, SREBP-1 seemed to be regulated by sterols to a lesser extent in the H2-35 liver cell line than it was in the 293 cells. When cells were depleted of cholesterol and fatty acids by treatment with DLS, they exhibited an increase in SREBP-1 and -2 expression (Fig. 2, lane 3). The DLS induced SREBP-2 cleavage to the nucleus was completely abolished by the addition of cholesterol and 25-OH, whereas SREBP-1 cleavage was only moderately reduced (Fig. 2, lane 4). In contrast, when oleate was added to the DLS containing media, mature SREBP-1 levels were decreased, whereas SREBP-2 levels remained relatively unchanged (lane 5). These data suggest that although mature SREBP-2 can be completely controlled by cholesterol at the level of cleavage, SREBP-1 is only partially responsive to sterol regulation and is also controlled by fatty acid levels. Because H2-35 cells are known to differentiate at 39 °C, initial studies on the glucose regulation of SREBP-1 focused on measuring the levels of precursor and mature SREBP proteins from nuclear extracts of H2-35 cells cultured in different concentrations of glucose for 24 h at either 33 or 39 °C. It was noted that when cells were cultured for 24 h in 2.75 mm glucose media, nuclear SREBP levels were almost undetectable, regardless of the differentiation state of the cells (Fig.3 A). Glucose levels in spent media from these cells were too low to detect. However, when media glucose concentrations were higher (5.5–25 mm), there was a notable difference in the pattern of expression of SREBP-1 as the cells converted from an undifferentiated to a differentiated phenotype. Upon differentiation at 39 °C, the levels of the precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1 were increased by glucose in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 A); however, when H2-35 cells were maintained at 33 °C, they expressed only moderate levels of the precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1, and these levels were not significantly influenced by media glucose concentrations. These data demonstrate that glucose responsiveness of SREBP-1 requires H2-35 cells to be in a differentiated state. The addition of mannitol to low glucose DMEM to bring the final molar concentration to 25 mm did not have any effect on SREBP-1 expression levels (data not shown), indicating that the glucose effect is not related to osmolarity. Because the antibody used for these studies is able to distinguish between the 1a and 1c isoforms, it is also of importance to note the difference in up-regulation of these two isoforms by glucose. Densitometric analysis of band intensity revealed that, although SREBP-1a (the upper band) was increased 1.9- and 2.3-fold in media containing 12.5 and 25 mm glucose compared with 5.5 mm, respectively, SREBP-1c was increased by 2.8- and 3.6-fold. These data indicate the possibility that SREBP-1c is more sensitive to glucose regulation than is SREBP-1a. To see the effects of insulin on SREBP-1 expression, H2-35 cells were cultured in serum-free media containing BSA. Importantly, SREBP-1 was induced by HG conditions in media lacking insulin (Fig. 3 B,lanes 1 and 3). The addition of 1 ng/ml of insulin to HG media increased SREBP-1 expression slightly (Fig.3 B, lanes 5 and 6); however, additional increases in insulin concentration did not further induce SREBP-1 expression (data not shown). Cells cultured in media containing FBS (which contains low levels of insulin) showed a substantial induction of SREBP-1 expression compared with those cultured in BSA in both LG and HG conditions (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to the serum-free media results, when insulin was added to HG media containing FBS, even at very high doses (100–500 ng/ml) there was no change in expression levels of SREBP-1 (Fig. 3 C). We conclude then that insulin mildly stimulates SREBP expression in differentiated H2-35 cells when added to serum-free media; however, high glucose media with FBS (and the insulin it contains) provides maximal stimulation for SREBP-1 expression. It is also important to note that a change from LG to HG, both in the complete absence of insulin (serum-free media), as well as in the presence of saturating concentrations of insulin (FBS media), resulted in the induction of SREBP-1 nuclear protein. To evaluate the timing of the effects of glucose on precursor and mature forms of SREBP-1, nuclear extracts from mouse liver H2-35 cells cultured in various concentrations of glucose were analyzed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment (Fig. 4). It was found that glucose had an appreciable dose-dependent effect on both precursor and nuclear forms of SREBP starting at 12 h, with no detectable effects at earlier times. Even after 48 h, the effects of HG on SREBP-1 expression could still be detected (data not shown). The addition of insulin to the FBS-containing media did not result in any detectable changes in mature or precursor SREBP levels at any time point (Fig. 4). Previous studies have focused primarily on insulin-induced transcription of SREBP-1 (18Kim J.B. Spiegelma"

The deduced 70.5-kDa protein, originally named METS-1 (mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition protein with SH3 domains), has since been cloned as a CD2-associated protein (CD2AP). CD2AP is strongly expressed in glomerular podocytes, and the absence of CD2AP in mice results in congenital nephrotic syndrome. We have found that METS-1/CD2AP (hereafter referred to as CD2AP) is expressed at lower levels in renal tubular epithelial cells in the adult kidney, particularly in distal nephron segments. Independent yeast two-hybrid screens using the COOH-terminal region of either CD2AP or polycystin-2 as bait identified the COOH termini of polycystin-2 and CD2AP, respectively, as strong interacting partners. This interaction was confirmed in cultured cells by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous polycystin-2 with endogenous CD2AP and vice versa. CD2AP shows a diffuse reticular cytoplasmic and perinuclear pattern of distribution, similar to polycystin-2, in cultured cells, and the two proteins co-localize by indirect double immunofluorescence microscopy. CD2AP is an adapter molecule that associates with a variety of membrane proteins to organize the cytoskeleton around a polarized site.

Kidney morphogenesis starts on embryonic day 11 when an epithelial structure, the ureteric bud, bulges from the Wolffian duct and invades the metanephric mesenchyme. Through a series of reciprocal interactions the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition leads to the formation of highly specialized, functionally diverse cell types that are characteristically patterned along the nephron to regulate waste removal and salt and water balance. This complex process is initiated by an inductive signal involving the leukemia inhibitory factor or other members of the interleukin-6 cytokine family and a mesenchymal growth factor (fibroblast growth factor 2, transforming growth factor α, or fibroblast growth factor 9), which together trigger aggregation of the cells (1Barasch J.

This developmental system is ideal for discovering the variety of “epithelial” genes that are activated (e.g. cytokeratins and basement membrane collagens) and of “mesenchymal” genes that are inactivated (e.g. vimentin and interstitial collagens) as a consequence of the mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition (cf.

Zerial M. Lehtonen E. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, duplicate filters were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled first strand cDNA probes representing embryonic day 11 uninduced metanephrogenic mesenchyme or 17-day embryonic kidney. The filter hybridized with the 17-day kidney probe was stripped and reprobed with an adult kidney cDNA probe. The clones that showed differential expression were isolated, and the inserts were recovered in pBluescript SK(−) by the Stratagene in vivo excision protocol. Longer CD2AP cDNA clones were obtained by screening of an adult mouse kidney cDNA library (M. Zerial, EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) and the 5′-end was cloned by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE System, Life Technologies, Inc.). Filter hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, containing the labeled probe at 1 × 106 cpm/ml. Filters were washed in 0.5× SSC, 1% SDS at 50 °C and exposed with intensifying screens at −70 °C overnight. The primers used for 5′-RACE were as follows: first round, 5′-CAC TGG GTC CAC ACC ACC TC-3′, 5′-GTG CAT CTA CAA TAC ACA AC-3′, 5′-CTA AGT TCG TCC ACG G-3′; second round, 5′-CTA CTG GAA GTT CTT GTC CG-3′, 5′-CTC CAA ATC CAA TTC CTC GG-3′, 5′-CTT TGG CTG TGC AAC TGA TC-3′. The 1914-bp open reading frame of CD2AP was obtained in three overlapping fragments, one from cDNA-library screenings and two from 5′-RACE, that lacked restriction sites suitable for ligation. Therefore, the full-length open reading frame was cloned by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with gene-specific primers from embryonic day 17 mouse kidney total RNA. The primers used were as follows: 5′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC GGA TCC ATG GTT GAC TAT ATT-3′; 3′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC CTC GAG TCA AGA CAA CAG AAC AGC-3′. The GenBankTM accession number for the sequence, originally named METS-1, is AF149092. Two micrograms of poly(A)-enriched RNA were resolved in 1.6% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto GeneScreen PlusTM membrane (DuPont). The 1.7-kb 3′-end of the CD2AP cDNA was labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming and hybridized as described previously (27Lehtonen S. Olkkonen V.M. Stapleton M. Zerial M. Lehtonen E. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue samples of the developing kidney were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. The sense and antisense cRNA-probes (550-bp long 3′-end fragment of CD2AP cDNA subcloned into pGEM3) were labeled with [35S]UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by the SP6/T7 run-off transcription method (Riboprobe II Core System, Promega). The hybridization was performed essentially as described (27Lehtonen S. Olkkonen V.M. Stapleton M. Zerial M. Lehtonen E. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). We used three different bait constructs of CD2AP for the yeast two-hybrid analysis, one from the NH2 terminus and two from the COOH terminus covering amino acids 1–167, 353–637, and 423–637, constructs N, C1, and C2, respectively. The fragments were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the CD2AP cDNA and subcloned asXhoI-BamHI inserts into pLexA (28Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1654) Google Scholar) to generate LexA fusion proteins. The primers used were construct N 5′-primer, 5′-TTT CTC GAG CGT TGA CTA TAT TGT GGA GTA TGA C-3′; construct N 3′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC GGA TCC TCA GGA CTC TAA TTC TTT CAC-3′; construct C1 5′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC CTC GAG CGA CCT GTC AGC TGC AGA GAA GAA AGC-3′; constructs C1 and C2 3′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC GGA TCC TCA AGA CAA CAG AAC AGC-3′; construct C2 5′-primer, 5′-GCC GCC CTC GAG CGC AGC CAA AAT TAA TGG AGA AGT TCC-3′. The adult mouse kidney MATCHMAKER cDNA library (catalogue number ML4002AB, CLONTECH) in the pGAD10 vector was used as prey. The screening was performed essentially as described (29Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). Briefly, the library and the bait constructs were transformed into yeast strain L40 that was then cultured in synthetic, minimal selection medium (SD medium) lacking Trp, Leu, and His. The positive clones on selective media were further confirmed by monitoring expression of the lacZreporter gene. No autonomous activation of the HIS3 orlacZ reporter genes was observed with any of the bait constructs. The inserts of lacZ-positive clones were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with pGAD10 vector-specific primers and subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega) for sequencing. CD2AP (residues 6–574) was expressed as a His6-tagged fusion protein inEscherichia coli, purified, and used for immunizing rabbits. The specific antibody reactivity in Western blotting (Fig.3 A) and immunofluorescence was blocked by preincubating the working dilution of the antiserum with the purified recombinant protein at 1 and 10 μg/ml, respectively. The preimmune serum was negative. A polycystin-2 rabbit antiserum (YCC2), generated against residues 687–962, has been characterized elsewhere (20Markowitz G.S. Cai Y. Li L. Wu G. Ward L.C. Somlo S. D'Agati V.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F17-F25PubMed Google Scholar, 30Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol.

An independent polycystin-2 rabbit antiserum (R223) was raised against a GST-tagged fusion protein carrying amino acid residues 747–968 of the mouse protein (GenBankTM accession number AF014010). In Western blotting, R223 detects a single band migrating at 110 kDa (not shown), corresponding to the size of polycystin-2 (11Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J.M. Somlo S. Science. 1996; 272: 1339-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). A mouse monoclonal antibody, YCE2, directed against residues 687–754 of PKD2 specifically recognized polycystin-2 on Western blots. 2Y. Cai and S. Somlo, manuscript in preparation. For preparation of frozen sections, kidneys were rapidly frozen in Tissue-Tek® O.C.T. Compound (Sakura). The sections were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The primary antisera and the tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were diluted in PBS containing 0.5% saponin and 5% fetal calf serum. The CD2AP full-length open reading frame (amino acids 1–637) was subcloned into pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The full-length PKD2 construct (TM4-FL) and the LLC-PK1 cell line stably expressing PKD2 in pCDNA3.1 have been previously described (30Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T.

Stable LLC-PK1 cells (LLC-PK1/TM4) expressing full-length PKD2 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. LLC-PK1/TM4 cells in 6-well culture plates were transfected with 2 μg of expression plasmid containing full-length CD2AP using Cytofectene (Bio-Rad). M-1 cells, which express native polycystin-2 and CD2AP, were transiently transfected with TM4-FL. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, and incubated with polyclonal anti-CD2AP and/or with monoclonal YCE2 anti-polycystin-2 antibody. Immunofluorescence was visualized by subsequent incubation with anti-rabbit-IgG-AlexaFluor (488 nm) and/or anti-mouse IgG-AlexaFluor (594 nm) (Molecular Probes). Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope and confocal microscopy with a Zeiss LSM 410 inverted laser scanning microscope. In vitro binding assays were performed essentially as described previously (31Ren R. Mayer B. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). A bacterially expressed Pkd2-GST fusion protein containing amino acids 747–968 of mouse polycystin-2 (GenBankTM accession number AF014010) or GST alone were purified using glutathione-Sepharose. The protein samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (Bio-Rad) membranes. Filters were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 1 mm CaCl2 (TBSC buffer). GST-CD2AP (amino acids 331–637) was biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions and added in TBSC at 1 μg/10 ml. After extensive washes in TBSC the filters were incubated with streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 0.2% gelatin in TBSC, washed, and developed using the Amersham Pharmacia Biotech enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. Co-immunoprecipitations, using lysates of M-1 cells, were performed as described (32Ora A. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26060-26062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except that Nonidet P-40 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used instead of CHAPS. The CD2AP antiserum or preimmune serum were used for immunoprecipitation, and the presence of polycystin-2 in the immunoprecipitates was monitored by Western blotting using the YCC2, R223, and YCE2 polycystin-2 antibodies followed by detection with ECL. Co-immunoprecipitations were also performed with the YCC2 antiserum and monitored by Western blotting with the CD2AP antiserum. To search for genes induced in the developing mouse kidney, we carried out a differential cDNA library screening (26Jansson S. Olkkonen V. Martin-Parras L. Chavrier P. Stapleton M. Zerial M. Lehtonen E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 27Lehtonen S. Olkkonen V.M. Stapleton M. Zerial M. Lehtonen E. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 775-782PubMed Google Scholar). From the original screening of 10,000 plaque-forming units, we obtained 36 clones that were differentially expressed either between embryonic day 11 metanephric mesenchymes and embryonic day 17 kidneys or between embryonic day 17 and adult kidneys. METS-1 (mesenchyme-to-epithelium transition protein with SH3 domains)/CD2AP (clone B102; Ref. 26Jansson S. Olkkonen V. Martin-Parras L. Chavrier P. Stapleton M. Zerial M. Lehtonen E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was identified as a gene showing strong up-regulation between embryonic days 11 and 17 (Fig.1 A). The ∼5.4-kb cDNA contains a 1914-bp open reading frame with a 66-bp 5′-untranslated region and an ∼3.4-kb 3′-untranslated region. CD2AP is predicted to encode a cytosolic protein of 70.5 kDa (Fig. 1, B andC). The NH2 terminus of the protein contains three Src homology domain 3 (SH3 domains) known to mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich motifs (33Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 34Morton C.J. Campbell I.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 615-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). A proline-rich region follows, in turn, the third SH3 domain of CD2AP, providing potential recognition sites for SH3 domains. A region rich in serine and threonine residues, which could be subject to phosphorylation, lies between the second and third SH3 domains. The COOH-terminal half of the protein is predicted to be globular, and the last 50 amino acids display high propensity for coiled-coil structure as predicted by the Coils and Paircoil programs (36Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). The expression pattern of CD2AP was studied by in situ hybridization in the embryonic day 17 mouse metanephric kidney, which contains all stages of nephron and collecting duct differentiation (Fig.2) (37Saxén L. Barlow P.W. Green P.B. Wylie C.C. Organogenesis of the Kidney. Cambridge University Press, UK1987Crossref Google Scholar). At the mRNA level, early epithelializing structures show distinct expression of CD2AP. The medullary, more mature branches of collecting ducts, and the glomeruli contain a high level of the transcript, whereas the expression in the ingrowing tips of the ureteric bud is significantly lower (Fig. 2). We examined the CD2AP protein expression pattern in embryonic day 17 and adult mouse kidney (Fig. 3). The CD2AP antiserum recognizes a single ∼80-kDa protein in the kidney (Fig. 3 A). The immunoblotting (Fig. 3 A) and immunocyto/histochemical (not shown) signal was competed by fusion protein, and the preimmune serum was negative. The distribution of the CD2AP protein in the embryonic day 17 kidney is similar to that of the mRNA. Strong expression of CD2AP is seen in the mature, medullary branches of collecting ducts and in mature glomerular podocytes (Fig.3 B). Although it is already present at low levels in the undifferentiated mesenchyme cells, CD2AP expression becomes more abundant in early epithelializing structures (Fig. 3, B andC). In the adult kidney, CD2AP retains very strong expression in glomerular structures and fairly strong expression in cortical collecting ducts (Fig. 3 D). There is weaker but positive immunoreactivity for CD2AP in distal nephron segments including those staining positive for Tamm-Horsfall protein, whereas proximal tubular staining is very low or absent (Fig. 3, Dand E). The presence of several potential protein-binding motifs in CD2AP prompted us to search for potential interacting partners by a yeast two-hybrid screen using different parts of the protein as baits. Screening of an adult mouse kidney library with the COOH-terminal region of CD2AP (Ala423–Ser637) resulted in the identification of five clones all encoding the cytosolic COOH terminus of the Pkd2 protein, polycystin-2 (11Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J.M. Somlo S.

Genomics. 1997; 45: 220-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The longest cDNA fragment contained Gly747–Val968 of polycystin-2, the shortest Val836–Val968, and the common overlapping region of all positive polycystin-2 clones was amino acids Val836–Val968. Conversely, a yeast two-hybrid screen using the COOH terminus of PKD2 (amino acids Ile680-Val968) as bait and a mouse embryonic day 9–10 library as prey identified a clone encoding amino acids Ser527–Glu615 of CD2AP among a number of positive clones. 3Y. Maeda and S. Somlo, unpublished observations. The sensitivity and specificity of the latter screen is corroborated by the fact that it also identified the COOH termini of Pkd1 and Pkd2, both known to interact with the COOH terminus of Pkd2 (39Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould K. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6965-6970Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 40Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between CD2AP and polycystin-2 was verified byin vitro binding assays. Biotinylated GST-CD2AP specifically bound to a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the polycystin-2 COOH terminus (Fig.4 A). The mouse kidney-derived cortical collecting duct epithelial M-1 cell line expresses both CD2AP and PKD2 endogenously. To test whether direct interaction occurs between the native CD2AP and PKD2 proteins in vivo, M-1 cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using the CD2AP and polycystin-2 antisera, respectively (Fig. 4, B andC). Western blotting of the CD2AP precipitates using the anti-polycystin-2 antisera YCC2 and R223 (not shown) and monoclonal antibody YCE2 (shown) revealed that the CD2AP antiserum co-immunoprecipitated native polycystin-2 (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, the YCC2 anti-polycystin-2 antiserum was found to co-immunoprecipitate native polycystin-2 and CD2AP from the same cell line (Fig. 4 C). This is the first interaction between a polycystin protein and a putative binding partner that is demonstrable by reciprocal immunoprecipitation studies using endogenously expressed, native proteins. Taken together, these findings of physical association between CD2AP and polycystin-2 in renal tubule-derived epithelial cells strongly support the occurrence of direct interaction between these native proteins in vivo. We examined the spatial distribution of CD2AP and polycystin-2 in cells to determine if their expression patterns are permissive for functional interaction. Immunofluorescent cell staining of wild type M-1 cells revealed that native CD2AP is expressed in a diffuse, fine reticular and perinuclear cytoplasmic pattern (Fig. 5 A). This pattern is similar to that described for polycystin-2 transfected into a wide range of cell lines (30Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R.

This native pattern of CD2AP expression was recapitulated in LLC-PK1 cells transiently transfected with the full-length CD2AP cDNA (Fig. 5 B). Indirect double immunofluorescence confoc"

By binding directly to carbohydrates on the surfaces of potential microbial pathogens, MBP and MBP-associated serine proteases (MASPs) can replace antibodies and complement components C1q, C1r, and C1s of the classical complement pathway. In order to investigate the mechanisms of MASP activation by MBP, the cDNAs of rat MASP-1 and -2 have been isolated, and portions encompassing the N-terminal CUB and epidermal growth factor-like domains have been expressed and purified. Biophysical characterization of the purified proteins indicates that each truncated MASP is a Ca2+-independent homodimer in solution, in which the interacting modules include the N-terminal two domains. Binding studies reveal that both MASPs associate independently with rat MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner through interactions involving the N-terminal three domains. The biophysical properties of the truncated MASPs indicate that the interactions with MBP leading to complement activation differ significantly from those between components C1q, C1r, and C1s of the classical pathway. Analysis of MASP binding by rat MBP containing naturally occurring mutations equivalent to those associated with human immunodeficiency indicates that binding to both truncated MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins is defective in such mutants.

Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). This pathway leads to neutralization of pathogenic microorganisms through an antibody-independent mechanism. MBP binds directly to sugars on the surfaces of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic cells and activates complement through two associated serine proteases (MASPs) that are homologues of C1r and C1s of the classical pathway. MBP in serum preparations copurifies with two distinct MASPs, MASP-1 and MASP-2 (3Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U.

Med. 1992; 176: 1497-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of the interactions leading to MASP activation is poorly understood. The MASPs probably bind to MBP near the N terminus in a collagen-like domain (5Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This region of MBP forms a central core that links trimeric subunits to form bouquet-like oligomers ranging from monomers to tetramers of subunits. In human MBP, three separate mutations within the corresponding portion of the collagenous domain are associated with an immunodeficiency disorder characterized by an increased susceptibility to infections (2Turner M.W. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 532-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). When these mutations are recreated in rat MBP, they lead to distinct structural defects that result in a reduced ability to activate the complement cascade (6Wallis R. Cheng J.Y.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4953-4959PubMed Google Scholar). The mutation Arg23 → Cys causes adventitious disulfide bond formation that reduces the proportion of trimers and tetramers of subunits. The reduced activity of this MBP variant is due to inefficient complement activation by the smaller oligomeric forms. The mutations Gly25 → Asp and Gly28 → Glu also lead to a small reduction in the proportion of higher order oligomers. However, even the larger oligomers in these mutants are inefficient at fixing complement, probably due to defective MASP binding. MASP-1 and MASP-2 share a common domain organization comprising two N-terminal CUB domains separated by an EGF-like domain, two complement control protein modules (CCP1 and CCP2), and a C-terminal serine protease domain (Fig.1). The EGF-like module of each protein has the characteristic sequence motif of a Ca2+-binding EGF-like domain (7Handford P.A. Mayhew M. Baron M. Winship P.R. Campbell I.D. Brownlee G.G. Nature. 1991; 351: 164-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). MASP-1 and MASP-2 are synthesized as zymogens (3Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C.

J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 571-578PubMed Google Scholar). Upon activation, each MASP polypeptide is cleaved, generating an active protease that is covalently attached to the N-terminal domains through a disulfide bond. MAP19 is an alternatively spliced form of both human and rat MASP-2 comprising the N-terminal two domains (9Takahashi M. Endo Y. Fujita T. Matsushita M. Int.

MAP19 copurifies with MBP, suggesting that the N-terminal domains of MASPs can interact with MBP.Figure 1Covalent structures of rat MASPs.

The truncated forms of MASP-1 and MASP-2 bind independently to MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner through interactions involving at least two of the three N-terminal modules. Binding of MASPs to variant MBPs associated with immunodeficiency is defective, indicating that aberrant interactions caused by structural defects in the mutant MBPs probably lead directly to inefficient complement fixation.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed by the method of Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) (Fig.2). Amino acid sequencing was carried out on a Beckman LF3000 protein sequencer. Polypeptide samples for sequence analysis were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (13Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation was carried out as described previously in a Beckman XLA-70 centrifuge (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Values reported are mean ± S.E. for at least two separate experiments. MALDI-MS was carried out on a FinniganMAT Lasermat mass spectrometer using sinapinic acid as the sample matrix (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin ([M + H]+ = 66431 Da) was used as the calibration standard. Protein samples from the column binding assays were concentrated by precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid prior to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding mature rat MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins were generated by amplifying overlapping fragments from a rat liver cDNA library using the polymerase chain reaction. Oligonucleotides were derived from the sequence of the corresponding mouse cDNAs (15Endo Y. Takahashi M. Nakao M. Saiga H. Sekine H. Matsushita M. Nonaka M. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4924-4930PubMed Google Scholar, 16Takayama Y. Takada F. Takahashi A. Kawakami M. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2308-2316PubMed Google Scholar). The 5′ oligonucleotides, ggagctcacagagcaggaaaatgaggt and caccatgaggctactcatcttcctg, contain the start codons (underlined) and encode the first 3 and 7 residues of the signal sequences of mouse MASP-1 and MASP-2. The 3′-end of each cDNA was cloned by 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends using a rat liver cDNA Marathon kit. Full-length cDNAs were assembled using convenient restriction sites. Standard molecular biological techniques were performed as described (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Truncated cDNAs were generated by introducing stop codons preceded by six histidine codons into the cDNAs by substitution of double-stranded oligonucleotides for restriction fragments at the 3′-ends. The position of the C-terminal ends of the encoded proteins are shown in Fig. 1. Restriction fragments encompassing the truncated cDNAs were ligated into the polylinker region of plasmid pED (18Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Wasley L.C. Michnick D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4485-4490Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmids were used to transfect adherent Chinese hamster ovary cell line DXB11, and production of the truncated MASPs was amplified by passaging cells into increasing concentrations of methotrexate (19Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 185: 537-566Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For large scale protein preparations, cells were grown to confluence in 225-cm2tissue culture flasks in 50 ml of minimal essential medium α lacking nucleosides and supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 0.5 μm methotrexate. Once confluence was reached, the medium was replaced with Chinese hamster ovary serum-free II medium supplemented with 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.55, 20 μm CaCl2, and 0.5 μmmethotrexate. Medium was harvested and replaced every second day for 8 days. Cell debris was removed prior to purification by centrifugation (3000 × g for 4 min), and medium was stored at −80 °C. Truncated MASPs were purified by loading 200 ml of medium diluted with an equal volume of loading buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl) onto a 1-ml column of nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose that had been preloaded with 5 ml of 50 mm NiSO4 and equilibrated with 10 ml of loading buffer. Following washing with 10 ml of loading buffer and 10 ml of buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, protein was eluted in 0.5-ml fractions in buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. MASP-containing fractions were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rabbit antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 15 amino acid residues of MASP-1 and MASP-2 conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Four injections were given at 2-week intervals, and serum was collected 2 weeks after the last injection. The MASP-1 peptide was synthesized by MWG-BIOTECH. Antibodies against MASP-2 were supplied by Eurogentec. Recombinant wild-type and mutant MBPs were purified by affinity chromatography on mannose-Sepharose columns (5Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled MBP was produced by incubating confluent cells in methionine-free minimal essential medium α, supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum, 0.5 μm methotrexate, and 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine for 16 h. MBP was purified as for unlabeled protein. MASP (5 μg) was preincubated with MBP (400 μg) in 200 μl of high salt buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 1.25 m NaCl, 25 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% gelatin) for 16 h at 4 °C, diluted to 3 ml in ice-cold high salt buffer, and loaded on to a 1-ml mannose-Sepharose column equilibrated in high salt buffer. Following washes with 3 ml of high and low salt buffers (150 mm NaCl), bound protein was eluted in 1-ml fractions of elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 0.01% gelatin). MBP was covalently attached to an agarose gel by incubating purified MBP (0.5 mg/ml) with 13 volume of Affi-Gel 10 matrix in 100 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, containing 25 mmCaCl2 for 4 h at 4 °C. MASP binding assays were carried out as described above except that protein was loaded on to the column in 2 ml of low salt buffer, washed with 2 ml of high and low salt buffers, and eluted in 1-ml fractions of 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 1.25 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA. Truncated MASP-1 and MASP-2 were incubated with 2.5 and 5% (w/w) trypsin in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and increasing concentrations of CaCl2 or EDTA (1 mm) for 1 h at 37 °C. Each reaction was stopped by boiling in loading buffer before separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The amount of each MASP remaining after proteolysis was determined by scanning desitometry. Data averaged from three separate experiments were fitted to multiple ligand-binding curves by nonlinear regression using MicroCal Origin (20Eftink M.R. Shastry M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Polystyrene plates were coated with 100 μl of the 3-domain truncated MASP-1 or MASP-2 (0.1 mg/ml) and incubated at 4 °C for 16 h. Wells were blocked with 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 25 mmCaCl2). Following incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, wells were emptied and washed three times with binding buffer.35S-Labeled MBP (∼50 ng at a specific activity of ∼1 × 105 cpm/μg) and 2-fold serial dilutions of either wild-type or mutant MBP were mixed in binding buffer containing 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin. Aliquots (100 μl) were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Wells were emptied and washed three times in ice-cold binding buffer. Bound protein was removed from the wells in two rinses (75 μl each) of 0.1m NaOH. Samples were neutralized with 50 μl of 0.5m acetic acid containing 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter. Levels of radioactivity were determined using a PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics following exposure for at least 16 h. Data were fitted to multiple ligand-binding curves by nonlinear regression using MicroCal Origin (20Eftink M.R. Shastry M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 258-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Preliminary studies indicated that the concentration of35S-labeled MBP used in the binding assays is below the concentration required for half-maximal binding. The cDNAs encoding rat MASP-1 and MASP-2 were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction. The encoded sequences of the mature polypeptides reveal that rat MASP-1 shares 95 and 86% sequence identity with mouse and human MASP-1, whereas rat MASP-2 shares 90 and 80% identity with its mouse and human counterparts (3Thiel S. Vorup-Jensen T. Schwaeble W. Laursen S.B. Poulsen K. Willis A.C. Eggleton P. Hansen S. Holmskov U. Reid K.B.M. Jensenius J.C.

Kawakami M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the encoded rat MASP-2 protein corresponds to the recently described sequence with the exception of five residues: Pro14 (encoded by cct), Gly15 (ggc), Pro487 (cct), His488(cat), and Ala603 (gcc) that were reported as Leu, Ala, Leu, Ile, and Arg (10Stover C.M. Thiel S. Lynch N.J. Schwaeble W.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6848-6859PubMed Google Scholar). In each case, the sequences of at least two independent PCR products confirm these differences. Further, residues Pro14, Gly15, Pro487, and His488 are conserved in both human and mouse MASP-2, suggesting that the discrepancies reflect errors in the original sequence. In order to produce large amounts of MASP-1 and MASP-2 for detailed biophysical analysis, cDNAs were introduced into an expression vector containing the dihydrofolate reductase gene as a selectable marker, and the resulting plasmids were used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells. Preliminary expression studies using the full-size MASP-1 cDNA revealed that the protein is produced only in trace amounts from the expression system. Compared with the much higher yields of other serum proteins produced using this expression system (5Wallis R. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3580-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 14Wallis R. Drickamer K. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 391-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the amounts of MASP-1 isolated suggest that expression of the MASP-1 gene may be cytotoxic, probably due to activation of the protease during biosynthesis. In order to produce sufficient material to study the interactions between the MASPs and MBP, truncated MASPs were created. Because the N-terminal domains of the MASPs are likely to be involved in interactions with MBP, as evidenced by the properties of MAP19, proteins comprising the N-terminal two and three domains of each MASP were produced. The truncated proteins were synthesized with C-terminal histidine tags enabling purification in a single step using affinity chromatography on an immobilized nickel column. Typical yields range from 0.2 to 1 mg from 200 ml of medium, sufficient to enable a detailed study of the structural organization and interactions with MBP. Since the proteins are produced in serum-free medium, they are free from contamination by other components of the complex and by other serum proteins. Each truncated MASP migrates as broad or multiple bands on reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gels with apparent molecular masses of ∼52 and 33 kDa for the truncated MASP-1 proteins and 43 and 24 kDa for the truncated MASP-2 proteins. N-terminal sequencing revealed a single sequence in each case (Fig. 1), confirming that the signal sequences are processed during biosynthesis. The mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels as well as analysis by MALDI-MS indicates that the polypeptides are glycosylated (TableI). There are two potentialN-glycosylation sites within the first three domains of each MASP (Fig. 1). Digestion of the three-domain truncated proteins with peptide:N-glycosidase F confirms that they are glycosylated. Following digestion, they migrate with reduced apparent molecular masses of 43 and 35 kDa, closer to those expected for the polypeptides alone. Both truncated proteins are resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion under native and denaturing conditions, indicating that theN-linked oligosaccharides consist of complex structures rather than high mannose or hybrid oligosaccharides.Table IBiophysical properties of truncated MASPsTruncated MASPUnmodified monomer molecular massAverage monomer molecular massPartial specific volumeWeight-averaged molecular mass + Ca2+ (2.5 mm)Weight-averaged molecular mass + EDTA (5 mm)kDakDaml/gkDakDaMASP-1 D1–220.023.20.69747 ± 143 ± 4MASP-1 D1–333.537.50.70375 ± 370 ± 2MASP-2 D1–219.521.70.70844 ± 242 ± 2MASP-2 D1–332.534.70.71474 ± 271 ± 3The unmodified molecular mass of each construct was calculated from the amino acid sequence.

Open table in a new tab The unmodified molecular mass of each construct was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Monomer molecular masses were determined by MALDI-MS. Partial specific volumes were calculated from the amino acid and carbohydrate compositions (23Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943: 370-381Google Scholar). Weight-averaged molecular masses were determined by equilibrium ultracentrifugation. Analytical ultracentrifugation indicates that both the two- and three-domain portions of MASP-1 and MASP-2 are stable homodimers (Table I). The shape-independent, weight-averaged molecular masses were determined by fitting the data to single species models. The truncated MASPs show no further self-association at concentrations in excess of those normally present in serum (Fig. 3). Similar molecular masses are observed in the presence and absence of EDTA, indicating that dimer formation is not dependent on Ca2+ binding (Table I). Thus, both two- and three-domain MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins are Ca2+-independent homodimers in which the interacting domains include the N-terminal CUB and EGF-like modules. Analytical ultracentrifugation was also used to determine whether the truncated MASPs interact with each other or whether they function independently to bind to MBP. An equilibrium experiment was set up in which three-domain MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins were mixed in equal molar amounts. The equilibrium distribution of the mixture corresponds precisely to the sum of the equilibrium distributions of the two components run in parallel at identical protein concentrations (Fig.4). Thus, the truncated MASP homodimers behave independently and do not interact with each other to form a complex even at high protein concentrations and in the presence of Ca2+. In order to examine the interactions between MBP and MASP-1 and -2, each of the purified truncated MASPs was incubated with an excess of purified recombinant MBP and passed through a mannose-Sepharose column to which MBP binds. Following several wash steps at both high and physiological salt concentrations, MBP and associated MASP were eluted by chelating the Ca2+ required for binding of MBP to the column. In the absence of MBP, each truncated MASP elutes in the unbound wash fractions, indicating that it does not interact directly with the mannose-Sepharose column (Fig.5). However, in the presence of MBP, the three-domain MASP-1 protein is largely retained on the column even after significant washing, indicating that it does interact with MBP that is bound to the column (Fig. 5). In contrast, no binding to MBP was detected for the two-domain MASP-1 protein, which elutes in the unbound wash fractions. Thus, the N-terminal three domains of MASP-1 are sufficient for stable binding to MBP in the absence of MASP-2, although the first two domains alone do not support tight binding. Similar binding results were obtained when the truncated MASP-1 proteins were passed through an affinity column in which MBP was covalently linked to the gel matrix (Fig. 5). The three-domain protein is largely retained on the column, while the two-domain protein elutes in the unbound fractions. When the high salt wash step was replaced by washing at physiological salt concentration, some of the two-domain protein was retained on the column, although the interaction was clearly weaker than binding by the three-domain protein under similar conditions (Fig. 5). Thus, MBP binding by MASP-1 occurs through interactions mediated by multiple modules including the N-terminal three domains. When the assay was carried out in the presence of EDTA, no binding was detected, indicating that the interaction between MBP and MASP-1 requires Ca2+. Analysis of MASP-2 using similar assays indicates that the truncated proteins bind to MBP independently of MASP-1. The three- and two-domain proteins are retained on the mannose-Sepharose and MBP-agarose columns through interactions with MBP (Fig. 5). No elution in the unbound fractions was observed by either truncated protein under the conditions examined. As with MASP-1, MASP-2 binding to MBP is Ca2+-dependent, because no binding to the affinity column is detected in the presence of EDTA. Thus, truncated MASP-1 and MASP-2 bind independently to MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner. In each case, binding is mediated through interactions including the N-terminal three domains. Because each MASP binds to MBP in a Ca2+-dependent manner, the Ca2+binding properties of the isolated N-terminal portions of the MASPs were investigated. Preliminary experiments revealed that each three-domain MASP protein has an increased susceptibility to proteolysis by trypsin in the absence of Ca2+, confirming that Ca2+ binds to and stabilizes each MASP. The Ca2+-binding properties of the three-domain MASP-1 and MASP-2 proteins were examined using trypsin digestion in the presence of increasing concentrations of Ca2+ (Fig.6). The apparent dissociation constants for Ca2+ are 0.35 ± 0.09 mm for MASP-1 and 0.19 ± 0.06 mm for MASP-2, indicating that each MASP binds to Ca2+ at physiological serum Ca2+concentrations (∼1 mm). The order of each binding curve is close to 1 (1.3 for MASP-1 and 0.9 for MASP-2), suggesting that each subunit of the homodimer binds one Ca2+. Because the EGF-like domains in MASP-1 and MASP-2 contain the consensus sequences for Ca2+ binding sites, it is likely that Ca2+ is bound to these domains. This suggestion is consistent with the digestion pattern of the three-domain MASP-2 protein. On typsin digestion, a relatively stable proteolytic fragment is produced with an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa under both reducing (Fig. 6) or nonreducing conditions. Following digestion by peptide:N-glycosidase F to remove the N-linked oligosaccharides, the apparent molecular mass is reduced to 20 kDa. Two N-terminal sequences are detected by Edman degradation when the proteolytic fragment is isolated under under nonreducing conditions: a sequence corresponding to the intact N terminus of the mature polypeptide and a sequence corresponding to residues Leu189–Arg197 within the second CUB domain. Thus, this proteolytic fragment probably corresponds to the N-terminal CUB and EGF-like domains of MASP-2 together with part of the second CUB domain up to the arginine residue at position 173 (calculated mass 19.5 kDa) covalently linked through a disulfide bond to the small peptide. The presence of a disulfide bond between cysteine residues at positions 165 and 192 of MASP-2 is compatible with the known disulfide bond arrangement in CUB domains (24Valera P.F. Romero A. Sanz L.

https://openalex.org/W2146277490,"Abstract The atsK gene of Pseudomonas putida S-313 was required for growth with alkyl sulfate esters as sulfur source. The AtsK protein was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. Sequence analysis revealed that AtsK was closely related to E. coli taurine dioxygenase (38% amino acid identity). The AtsK protein catalyzed the α-ketoglutarate-dependent cleavage of a range of alkyl sulfate esters, with chain lengths ranging from C4 to C12, required oxygen and Fe2+ for activity and released succinate, sulfate, and the corresponding aldehyde as products. Enzyme activity was optimal at pH 7 and was strongly stimulated by ascorbate. Unlike most other characterized α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases, AtsK accepted a range of α-keto acids as co-substrates, including α-ketoglutarate (K m 140 μm), α-ketoadipate, α-ketovalerate, and α-ketooctanoate. The measuredK m values for hexyl sulfate and SDS were 40 and 34 μm, respectively. The apparent M rof the purified enzyme of 121,000 was consistent with a homotetrameric structure, which is unusual for this enzyme superfamily, members of which are usually monomeric or dimeric. The properties and amino acid sequence of the AtsK enzyme thus define it as an unusual oxygenolytic alkylsulfatase and a novel member of the α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase family."

The structure revealed that the apoprotein forms noncovalent dimers with two molecules that associate in an antiparallel manner to form a tightly packed hydrophobic core at the dimer interface involving six of the eight helices present in the protein and the C-terminal loop (Fig. 2). Upon calcium binding, the conformation of S100B changes dramatically from the compact structure in the apo-form to a more extended form. These changes lead to exposure of several residues in the C-terminal domain and the hinge region of S100B that serve for interaction with target proteins (6Barber K.R. McClintock K.A.

A, the S100 monomer consists of two EF-hand motifs (EF1 and EF2), which are the structural motifs for calcium binding. The hinge region, which connects the two EF hand motif and the terminal hand of helix IV (Cter), is implicated in the interaction of Ca2+-bound S100B with target proteins. B, the primary structure of the C-terminal end of S100B constructs, chimeric S100B/A1Cter, and S100A1/BCter are represented.

To our knowledge, only the Ndr kinase has been co-immunoprecipitated with S100B from whole cell extracts (21Millward T.A. Heizmann C.W. Schafer B.W. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5913-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In several cases, tissue or cellular distribution of reported targets does not correlate with that of the S100B (i.e. CapZα), casting doubts on the purely biochemical approaches. Here, we have screened a cDNA library of human brain using yeast two-hybrid technology to find interacting proteins for S100B in vivo. We have identified S100A6 (previously named calcyclin, CaBP, PRA, 2A9, or 5B10) and S100A11 (previously named S100C or calgizzarin) as specific S100B target proteins.DISCUSSIONIdentification of the physiological S100B target proteins and characterization of their mode of interaction with S100B are essential to determine the exact contribution of the S100B-dependent signaling pathway to cell functions. In this study, we used the two-hybrid system to identify specific S100B target proteins. A large screen of a cDNA library from human brain using human S100B fused with the LexA DNA binding domain as bait allowed us to identify S100A6 and S100A11 as putative specific in vivo targets of S100B. The specificity of those interactions was further demonstrated by the observations that S100A1, which presents 56% identity at the amino acid level, is capable of interaction with S100B but does not interact with S100A6 or S100A11. Furthermore, no cross-interaction has been observed between S100A6 and S100A11. The interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS-7 cells and MG U373 astroglioma cells.The first question raised by the isoform-specific interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 in yeast concerns the molecular mechanisms that govern such interactions. Comparison of β-galactosidase activities for qualitative evaluation of interactions (50Estojak J. Brent R. Golemis E.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5820-5829Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) revealed differences in the strength of homo- and heterointeraction between S100 species, suggesting that the mode of interaction between S100 species is not equivalent. The high avidity of interaction between S100B and S100A1 would correspond to the conventional S100 dimerization model revealed by the solution structure of apo-S100B, with helix I and helix IV flanking the calcium binding sites I and II as the major contributors to the dimer interface (24Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Drohat A.C. Tjandra N. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11577-11588Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As expected, deletion of the extreme C terminus had no significant effect on S100B homodimerization and heterodimerization with S100A1. The apparent equivalent affinity for S100B homodimerization or heterodimerization with S100A1 is consistent with previous in vitro data showing that, after acid-dependent dissociation of the S100B and S100A1 homodimers, the proteins reassociate as homodimer (S100A1, S100B) or heterodimer (S100a) with the same probability (46Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An equivalent affinity for S100B homodimerization or heterodimerization with S100A1 is also supported by co-immunoprecipitation experiments using COS-7 cells transfected with EGF-S100B and Myc-S100 fusion proteins. An equivalent amount of EGF-S100B protein is co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-S100B or Myc-S100A1 fusion proteins.The avidity of interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 is much less pronounced than for the interaction between S100B with itself or with S100A1. Differences were confirmed by deletion or mutation within the C-terminal domain of S100B. Deletion of the C terminus on S100B or mutation of either Phe87 or Phe88 to Ala was found sufficient to abrogate interaction with S100A6 and S100A11. The structural change of S100B in the presence of Ca2+ involves the exposure to solvent of the C terminus encompassing Phe87 and Phe88 (24Drohat A.C. Baldisseri D.M. Rustandi R.R. Weber D.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2729-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Drohat A.C. Tjandra N. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 30Smith S.P. Shaw G.S. Structure. 1998; 6: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The C terminus, and specifically Phe87 and Phe88, is implicated in interaction of S100B with target proteins (1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that S100B interaction with S100A6 and S100A11 has similarity with interaction between S100B and target protein. Using chimeric S100B/A1Cter and S100A1/BCter proteins, we also showed that the C terminus of S100B is not sufficient for specific interaction with S100A6 and S100A11. Multiple residues distributed throughout on helix II, helix III, and the hinge region of S100B, not involved at the dimer interface, are also implicated in interaction with target peptide (32Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Drohat A.C. Weber D.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1743-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These residues most likely also contribute to interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11. Altogether, these data suggest that the specific interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 should not be viewed as typical heterodimerization but rather as a model of interaction between S100B and target proteins. This model is also supported by the lack of interaction between S100A1 and S100A6 or S100A11. The specificity of interaction of S100B versus S100A1 with target protein has recently been reported in vitro (23Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The stabilization of the S100B-S100A6 or S100B-S100A11 heterocomplexes by Ca2+/Zn2+ (Figs. 5 and 6 B; see Ref.51Yang Q. O'Hanlon D. Heizmann C.W. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also supports such a model.At this stage, some questions remain as to why any other proteins than S100 are not detected as S100B targets in the yeast two-hybrid system. It is noteworthy that several attempts to demonstrate interaction between S100B and two putative calcium-dependent target proteins, p53 and CapZα (18Ivanenkov V.V. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Gruenstein E. Dimlich R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14651-14658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,23Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), in the yeast two-hybrid system also proved unsuccessful (data not shown). Other studies also demonstrated the limitation of two-hybrid methodology in identifying S100 target proteins other than S100 isoforms (51Yang Q. O'Hanlon D. Heizmann C.W. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 52Propper C. Huang X. Roth J. Sorg C. Nacken W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 53Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Two hypotheses to explain these observations can be suggested. It is possible that in the yeast two-hybrid, strict Ca2+-dependent interactions cannot be monitored. This could be due to tight calcium homeostasis regulation in yeast. Such a hypothesis is compatible with the fact that using calmodulin as bait, only calcium-independent targets have been detected (39Prichard L. Deloulme J.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7689-7694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 54Brill S. Li S. Lyman C.W. Church D.M. Wasmuth J.J. Weissbach L. Bernards A. Snijders A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4869-4878Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 55Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Calcium-independent interactions between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 have been observed in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and Ca2+ only strengthens the interactions (Figs. 5and 6 B). Interaction between S100A4 and S100A1 could also be detected in the absence of calcium (53Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A second possible explanation is that the native conformation of S100B is affected when fused with LexA DNA binding domain, preventing interaction with calcium-dependent target proteins.In vitro, purified S100B and S100A1 proteins exist as homodimers but do not spontaneously associate as heterodimers, unless the proteins are first denatured or the quaternary structure is destabilized upon calcium-binding (46Baudier J. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8204-8212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when expressed in yeast, S100B and S100A1 associate as heterodimers. The same phenomenon has been reported with S100A8 and S100A9 (52Propper C. Huang X. Roth J. Sorg C. Nacken W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 183-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The dynamic equilibrium that seems to exist between monomeric and dimeric forms in living cells indicates that the biologically active form of S100 proteins is probably not restricted to homodimers. The S100 proteins are also capable of interaction with each other (present study, and see Refs. 51Yang Q. O'Hanlon D. Heizmann C.W. Marks A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 246: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholarand 53Wang G. Rudland P.S. White M.R. Barraclough R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11141-11146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The physical interaction between S100B and S100A6 or S100A11 might also have physiological implications. The co-expression of S100 species in the same cells should not be viewed as strictly coincidental. In normal brain, a co-localization of S100B with S100A6 and S100C has been reported in astrocytes, ependymal cells, and Schwann cells (56Yamashita N. Kosaka K. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. Brain Res. 1997; 778: 388-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 57Yamashita N. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Kosaka T. J. Comp. Neurol. 1999; 404: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have confirmed the co-expression of S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 in primary cultures of rat brain astrocyte by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis (data not shown). It is also significant that misregulation of S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 expression is also often observed in tumors, including astrocytic tumors (58Camby I. Nagy N. Lopes M.B. Schafer B.W. Maurage C.A. Ruchoux M.M. Murmann P. Pochet R. Heizmann C.W. Brotchi J. Salmon I. Kiss R. Decaestecker C. Brain Pathol. 1999; 9: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and melanoma (11Boni R. Heizmann C.W. Doguoglu A. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Dummer R. Burg G. J. Cutan. Pathol. 1997; 24: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We have shown in this study that in the human astrocytoma cell line MG U373, S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 are also co-expressed. In exponentially growing cultures, the three S100 protein species co-localize within membrane ruffling-like structures. Significant S100 immunoreactivity is also present in the cell nuclei (Fig. 7). When MG U373 cells reach confluence, the S100 protein expression is drastically up-regulated in a concerted fashion, and the proteins accumulate within the cell cytoplasm. The co-expression of the S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 in the same cells, together with the ability of the individual proteins to interact with each other, suggests that they might interfere with the function of their related proteins. Although the exact functions of the individual S100 proteins are still unknown, there are suspicions that they might be involved in different cell regulation pathways. As an example, the calcium-dependent interaction of S100B with the p53 protein is specific and has not been observed with S100A6 (23Delphin C. Ronjat M. Deloulme J.C. Garin G. Debussche L. Higashimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Baudier J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10539-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that interaction between S100A6 or S100A11 and S100B could modulate binding of S100B to target proteins. Hence, S100A6 or S100A11 could behave as regulator of the S100B-dependent signaling pathway. S100 proteins are a family of low molecular weight, acidic, calcium-binding proteins that contain two EF-hand calcium binding sites. To date, 19 different proteins have been assigned to the S100 protein family (reviewed in Refs. 1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar and 2Schafer B.W. Heizmann C.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 134-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1035) Google Scholar). They show different degrees of similarity, ranging from 25 to 56% identity at the amino acid level, and share conserved structural features and possibly common mechanisms of action (1Donato R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Some of the S100 proteins, including S100B, S100A6, and S100A11 are not only calcium-binding proteins but also bind Zn2+ with high affinity (3Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 28929-28936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+ binding has a pronounced effect of increasing the Ca2+ affinity in S100B (3Baudier J. Glasser N. Gerard D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8192-8203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of increasing S100B binding to target peptides (6Barber K.R. McClintock K.A. Jamieson Jr., G.A. Dimlich R.V. Shaw G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1502-1508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The S100B has attracted much interest in the past few years because, like other proteins implicated in neurodegeneration (e.g.β-amyloid, superoxide dismutase), its gene is located within a segment of chromosome 21, which is trisomic in Down's syndrome (DS)1 (7Allore R.

The observed overexpression of S100B in the brains of patients with DS, Alzheimer's disease (8Marshak D.R. Pesce S.A. Stanley L.C. Griffin W.S. Neurobiol.

Within the brain, expression of S100B is mainly restricted to glial cells. Moreover, S100B protein is up-regulated in many tumors (11Boni R. Heizmann C.W. Doguoglu A. Ilg E.C. Schafer B.W. Dummer R.

Each monomer within these dimer pairs interacts with a half-site sequence, AGNNCA (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B.

Based on half-site specificity, nuclear receptors can be divided into two subgroups. The estrogen receptor (ER) subgroup, which also includes the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor among others, recognizes the core sequence, AGGTCA. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) subgroup, which includes the androgen receptor and progesterone receptor, has distinct half-site specificity for AGAACA. The two central nucleotides in the half-site sequence therefore largely determine DNA sequence recognition by the two groups of nuclear receptors. Structure-function analyses reveal that nuclear receptors distinguish these two nucleotides via three amino acid residues in the proximal (P)-box of the first zinc finger (21Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M.

These P-box residues are located within a DNA recognition α-helix that interacts with the major groove of the DNA response element (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar).In contrast to these dimeric receptors, a small group of orphan nuclear receptors binds to DNA as monomers. These factors recognize the estrogen response element (ERE)-type half-site, AGGTCA, and include SF-1, FTZ-F1, NGFI-B, RevErbA, and ROR α (24Tsukiyama T. Niwa O.

Several of these receptors share a 30-amino acid basic region carboxyl-terminal to the second zinc finger designated the FTZ-F1 box or A-box (25Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J.

This A-box is proposed to recognize additional nucleotide sequences 5′ to the AGGTCA motif in the minor groove of the response element DNA. For example, SF-1 binds preferentially to the 5′-flanking sequencePyCA AGGTCA (where Py is pyrimidine), whereas NGFI-B recognizes AA AGGTCA.Recently, we reported a SF-1 mutation in a patient with XY sex reversal, primary adrenal insufficiency, dysgenetic testes, and persistent Müllerian structures (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The heterozygous G35E mutation involves the last amino acid in the P-box, an area shown previously to be critical for DNA binding of other nuclear receptors (21Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As expected, this mutant SF-1 protein failed to bind to SF-1 response elements such as those found in the proximal promoter of SCC (Cyp11a), and no transactivation of this gene was seen (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, because SF-1 response elements are variable, we considered the possibility that this P-box mutant might recognize other SF-1 response elements.In this report, we examined mutant SF-1 binding to response elements from a variety of target genes. These studies revealed surprising heterogeneity in the SF-1 binding interactions with various target sequences, thereby allowing detailed analysis of the structural determinants in SF-1 and its recognition sites that mediate receptor binding. We find that interactions between the A-box and the 5′-flanking sequence of the response element stabilize monomeric binding by SF-1, especially in situations where binding affinity is compromised by P-box mutations.DISCUSSIONNuclear receptors regulate gene transcription in diverse biological systems. DNA binding specificity is crucial, therefore, so that different receptors can recognize their specific target genes appropriately. Several studies have shown that the DNA binding specificity of classic ligand-dependent nuclear receptors is determined by the P-box amino acid sequence (for example, GSV for the GR, EGA for the ER, and EGG for the TR (Fig. 4 A) (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 19Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)). The GS sequence of the GR recognizes the GRE-type half-site, AGAACA, whereas the EG residues of the ER and TR recognize the ERE-type half-site, AGGTCA. Comparatively little is known about the DNA binding specificity of SF-1, an orphan nuclear receptor that has no known ligand and one of the few nuclear receptors that binds DNA as a monomer. SF-1 has a hybrid P-box sequence (ESG) and recognizes a consensus response element consisting of an ERE-type half-site and three preceding nucleotides (PyCA AGGTCA) (35Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of a naturally occurring human SF-1 P-box mutation (G35E) (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) led us to investigate the structural determinants of DNA binding specificity of SF-1 further.Initial studies showed that the G35E SF-1 mutant did not bind to either of two SF-1 response elements present in the proximal promoter region of the SCC gene (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This lack of binding might be predicted, as a similar glycine to glutamic acid mutation at the third P-box position resulted in loss of TR binding (33Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16981-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Also, the patient's phenotype of primary adrenal failure is consistent with impaired transcription of steroidogenic enzymes. However, SF-1 regulates the transcription of a wide array of target genes (35Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Many of these have response elements that deviate from the consensus SF-1 sequence such as the murine DAX-1 composite enhancer (Table I; TCG AGGTCA, TCA TGGCCA) (4Yu R.N. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or the inhibin α gene, where SF-1 regulates gene transcription through its interaction with CREB bound to the cAMP-response element (17Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized therefore that the G35E mutant might exhibit different DNA binding specificity with respect to other SF-1 response elements.Among the SF-1 response elements studied, the G35E mutant was found to bind to the MIS and aromatase promoters with an affinity approaching that of wild-type SF-1. These promoters share a common SF-1 response element, CCA AGGTCA. Comparison of this sequence with other native SF-1 response elements (Table I) led us to speculate that the first position of the three nucleotides in the 5′-flanking sequence and the fourth and fifth nucleotides of the nuclear receptor half-site itself may influence the DNA binding specificity of the G35E mutant. These nucleotides were replaced with those found in other native promoters to investigate this further. Substitution of the flanking cytosine (CCA) with thymine (TCA) in the aromatase SF-1 response element actually strengthened binding by the mutant SF-1, highlighting the importance of a pyrimidine in this flanking sequence. However, binding was impaired significantly following substitution of this nucleotide with a purine (ACA, GCA) or alteration of the central part of the half-site, supporting the hypothesis that the first nucleotide of the flanking sequence, as well as the composition of the half-site, influence DNA binding by the P-box motif.The role of each of the three P-box amino acid residues in half-site recognition has been studied previously for a variety of nuclear receptors, which allowed us to predict the outcome of mutating these codons in SF-1 (36Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first P-box residue (position 31 for SF-1) is a glutamic acid in SF-1, ER, and TR and a glycine in GR. This glutamic acid facilitates binding to response elements containing guanine at the third position of the nuclear receptor half-site (ERE, AGGTCA) and inhibits binding to those containing adenine (GRE, AGAACA) (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced binding of the SF-1 E31G mutant is consistent with these observations. At the second P-box position (32 for SF-1) SF-1 and GR have a serine, and ER and TR have a glycine. Replacement of this serine with glycine has been shown to increase binding of GR to an ERE-type half-site (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the S32G SF-1 mutant showed similar DNA binding specificity to wild-type SF-1. Finally, the third P-box residue (position 35 for SF-1) is a glycine in SF-1 and TR, an alanine in ER, and a valine in GR. Like the glutamic acid in the first P-box position, this valine has a dual function of facilitating binding to response elements containing adenine at the fourth position of the nuclear receptor half-site (GRE, AGAACA) and inhibiting binding to those containing thymine (ERE, AGGTCA) (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to our prediction, the G35V mutant bound reasonably well to the wild-type response element (half-site; AGGTCA). However, binding of this mutant to the modified half-sites (M4, AGGCTA; M5, AGGCCA) was reduced dramatically presumably due to the mutation introduced into the fourth nucleotide position of the half-site. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the three amino acid residues in the P-box are critical for recognition of the half-site by SF-1, a nuclear receptor that binds to DNA as a monomer. It is also notable that the P-box sequence of SF-1 (ESG) showed the same DNA binding specificity as that of the TR (EGG) because monomeric TR binding has been demonstrated in certain circumstances (38Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mutations of the first nucleotide in the 5′-flanking sequence affected binding of several P-box mutants in addition to the G35E mutant protein. This observation provides further evidence that SF-1 binding can be influenced by the 5′-flanking sequence as well as the central part of the nuclear receptor half-site itself. However, it is unclear whether this represents a direct interaction between the P-box motif and the 5′-flanking sequence or whether the flanking sequence has an indirect effect by stabilizing the bound protein-DNA complex. Because it has been suggested that the FTZ-F1/SF-1 A-box can interact directly with this 5′-flanking sequence without interacting with the half-site (25Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we introduced two mutations into the SF-1 A-box based on previous studies of FTZ-F1. The A-box mutations, R92Q (R589Q in FTZ-F1) and K94Q (K591Q in FTZ-F1), did not affect DNA binding on their own. However, introduction of the R92Q mutation in the background of the G35E mutant reduced binding quite dramatically. Taken together, these data support the idea that the A-box of SF-1 can stabilize monomeric binding to half-sites through an interaction with the 5′-flanking sequence in the minor groove of DNA. The additional binding energy provided by this contact may facilitate monomeric binding by receptors, thereby compensating for the stability otherwise provided by receptor dimerization. This interaction may be particularly important when P-box binding is compromised either by mutations in SF-1 or by sequence alterations in its binding site.In this particular patient, activation of the aromatase promoter by the G35E SF-1 mutant probably had little clinical significance because of multiple other deficiencies in steroidogenesis. In addition, activation of the MIS promoter may have had little effect if the dysgenetic testes had reduced capacity to produce MIS. Nevertheless, this study does indicate that a single mutation in SF-1 can exert differential effects on various target genes. This concept may also apply to other transcription factors that regulate multiple downstream target genes with variant response elements. Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1)1 (FTZF1) (1Lala D.S. Rice D.A.

These regions include an amino-terminal, two zinc finger DNA-binding domain, a putative ligand-binding/dimerization domain, and a carboxyl-terminal AF2 transactivation domain (see Fig. 1 A) (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M.

In general, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily bind to DNA as dimers. Each monomer within these dimer pairs interacts with a half-site sequence, AGNNCA (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 19Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

Based on half-site specificity, nuclear receptors can be divided into two subgroups. The estrogen receptor (ER) subgroup, which also includes the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and retinoic acid receptor among others, recognizes the core sequence, AGGTCA. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) subgroup, which includes the androgen receptor and progesterone receptor, has distinct half-site specificity for AGAACA. The two central nucleotides in the half-site sequence therefore largely determine DNA sequence recognition by the two groups of nuclear receptors. Structure-function analyses reveal that nuclear receptors distinguish these two nucleotides via three amino acid residues in the proximal (P)-box of the first zinc finger (21Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M.

These P-box residues are located within a DNA recognition α-helix that interacts with the major groove of the DNA response element (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In contrast to these dimeric receptors, a small group of orphan nuclear receptors binds to DNA as monomers. These factors recognize the estrogen response element (ERE)-type half-site, AGGTCA, and include SF-1, FTZ-F1, NGFI-B, RevErbA, and ROR α (24Tsukiyama T. Niwa O.

Several of these receptors share a 30-amino acid basic region carboxyl-terminal to the second zinc finger designated the FTZ-F1 box or A-box (25Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 26Wilson T.E. Paulsen R.E. Padgett K.A. Milbrandt J.

This A-box is proposed to recognize additional nucleotide sequences 5′ to the AGGTCA motif in the minor groove of the response element DNA. For example, SF-1 binds preferentially to the 5′-flanking sequencePyCA AGGTCA (where Py is pyrimidine), whereas NGFI-B recognizes AA AGGTCA. Recently, we reported a SF-1 mutation in a patient with XY sex reversal, primary adrenal insufficiency, dysgenetic testes, and persistent Müllerian structures (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The heterozygous G35E mutation involves the last amino acid in the P-box, an area shown previously to be critical for DNA binding of other nuclear receptors (21Mader S. Kumar V. de Verneuil H. Chambon P. Nature. 1989; 338: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 22Danielsen M. Hinck L. Ringold G.M. Cell. 1989; 57: 1131-1138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). As expected, this mutant SF-1 protein failed to bind to SF-1 response elements such as those found in the proximal promoter of SCC (Cyp11a), and no transactivation of this gene was seen (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). However, because SF-1 response elements are variable, we considered the possibility that this P-box mutant might recognize other SF-1 response elements. In this report, we examined mutant SF-1 binding to response elements from a variety of target genes. These studies revealed surprising heterogeneity in the SF-1 binding interactions with various target sequences, thereby allowing detailed analysis of the structural determinants in SF-1 and its recognition sites that mediate receptor binding. We find that interactions between the A-box and the 5′-flanking sequence of the response element stabilize monomeric binding by SF-1, especially in situations where binding affinity is compromised by P-box mutations. DISCUSSIONNuclear receptors regulate gene transcription in diverse biological systems. DNA binding specificity is crucial, therefore, so that different receptors can recognize their specific target genes appropriately. Several studies have shown that the DNA binding specificity of classic ligand-dependent nuclear receptors is determined by the P-box amino acid sequence (for example, GSV for the GR, EGA for the ER, and EGG for the TR (Fig. 4 A) (18Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar, 19Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D.

The GS sequence of the GR recognizes the GRE-type half-site, AGAACA, whereas the EG residues of the ER and TR recognize the ERE-type half-site, AGGTCA. Comparatively little is known about the DNA binding specificity of SF-1, an orphan nuclear receptor that has no known ligand and one of the few nuclear receptors that binds DNA as a monomer. SF-1 has a hybrid P-box sequence (ESG) and recognizes a consensus response element consisting of an ERE-type half-site and three preceding nucleotides (PyCA AGGTCA) (35Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of a naturally occurring human SF-1 P-box mutation (G35E) (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) led us to investigate the structural determinants of DNA binding specificity of SF-1 further.Initial studies showed that the G35E SF-1 mutant did not bind to either of two SF-1 response elements present in the proximal promoter region of the SCC gene (30Achermann J.C. Ito M. Ito M. Hindmarsh P.C. Jameson J.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 125-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This lack of binding might be predicted, as a similar glycine to glutamic acid mutation at the third P-box position resulted in loss of TR binding (33Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16988-16994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 34Nelson C.C. Hendy S.C. Romaniuk P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16981-16987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Also, the patient's phenotype of primary adrenal failure is consistent with impaired transcription of steroidogenic enzymes. However, SF-1 regulates the transcription of a wide array of target genes (35Parker K.L. Schimmer B.P. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 361-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Many of these have response elements that deviate from the consensus SF-1 sequence such as the murine DAX-1 composite enhancer (Table I; TCG AGGTCA, TCA TGGCCA) (4Yu R.N. Ito M. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1010-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) or the inhibin α gene, where SF-1 regulates gene transcription through its interaction with CREB bound to the cAMP-response element (17Ito M. Park Y. Weck J. Mayo K.E. Jameson J.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 66-81PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized therefore that the G35E mutant might exhibit different DNA binding specificity with respect to other SF-1 response elements.Among the SF-1 response elements studied, the G35E mutant was found to bind to the MIS and aromatase promoters with an affinity approaching that of wild-type SF-1. These promoters share a common SF-1 response element, CCA AGGTCA. Comparison of this sequence with other native SF-1 response elements (Table I) led us to speculate that the first position of the three nucleotides in the 5′-flanking sequence and the fourth and fifth nucleotides of the nuclear receptor half-site itself may influence the DNA binding specificity of the G35E mutant. These nucleotides were replaced with those found in other native promoters to investigate this further. Substitution of the flanking cytosine (CCA) with thymine (TCA) in the aromatase SF-1 response element actually strengthened binding by the mutant SF-1, highlighting the importance of a pyrimidine in this flanking sequence. However, binding was impaired significantly following substitution of this nucleotide with a purine (ACA, GCA) or alteration of the central part of the half-site, supporting the hypothesis that the first nucleotide of the flanking sequence, as well as the composition of the half-site, influence DNA binding by the P-box motif.The role of each of the three P-box amino acid residues in half-site recognition has been studied previously for a variety of nuclear receptors, which allowed us to predict the outcome of mutating these codons in SF-1 (36Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first P-box residue (position 31 for SF-1) is a glutamic acid in SF-1, ER, and TR and a glycine in GR. This glutamic acid facilitates binding to response elements containing guanine at the third position of the nuclear receptor half-site (ERE, AGGTCA) and inhibits binding to those containing adenine (GRE, AGAACA) (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reduced binding of the SF-1 E31G mutant is consistent with these observations. At the second P-box position (32 for SF-1) SF-1 and GR have a serine, and ER and TR have a glycine. Replacement of this serine with glycine has been shown to increase binding of GR to an ERE-type half-site (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings, the S32G SF-1 mutant showed similar DNA binding specificity to wild-type SF-1. Finally, the third P-box residue (position 35 for SF-1) is a glycine in SF-1 and TR, an alanine in ER, and a valine in GR. Like the glutamic acid in the first P-box position, this valine has a dual function of facilitating binding to response elements containing adenine at the fourth position of the nuclear receptor half-site (GRE, AGAACA) and inhibiting binding to those containing thymine (ERE, AGGTCA) (37Zilliacus J. Wright A.P. Norinder U. Gustafsson J.A. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24941-24947Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contrary to our prediction, the G35V mutant bound reasonably well to the wild-type response element (half-site; AGGTCA). However, binding of this mutant to the modified half-sites (M4, AGGCTA; M5, AGGCCA) was reduced dramatically presumably due to the mutation introduced into the fourth nucleotide position of the half-site. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the three amino acid residues in the P-box are critical for recognition of the half-site by SF-1, a nuclear receptor that binds to DNA as a monomer. It is also notable that the P-box sequence of SF-1 (ESG) showed the same DNA binding specificity as that of the TR (EGG) because monomeric TR binding has been demonstrated in certain circumstances (38Katz R.W. Koenig R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19392-19397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Mutations of the first nucleotide in the 5′-flanking sequence affected binding of several P-box mutants in addition to the G35E mutant protein. This observation provides further evidence that SF-1 binding can be influenced by the 5′-flanking sequence as well as the central part of the nuclear receptor half-site itself. However, it is unclear whether this represents a direct interaction between the P-box motif and the 5′-flanking sequence or whether the flanking sequence has an indirect effect by stabilizing the bound protein-DNA complex. Because it has been suggested that the FTZ-F1/SF-1 A-box can interact directly with this 5′-flanking sequence without interacting with the half-site (25Ueda H. Sun G.C. Murata T. Hirose S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5667-5672Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), we introduced two mutations into the SF-1 A-box based on previous studies of FTZ-F1. The A-box mutations, R92Q (R589Q in FTZ-F1) and K94Q (K591Q in FTZ-F1), did not affect DNA binding on their own. However, introduction of the R92Q mutation in the background of the G35E mutant reduced binding quite dramatically. Taken together, these data support the idea that the A-box of SF-1 can stabilize monomeric binding to half-sites through an interaction with the 5′-flanking sequence in the minor groove of DNA. The additional binding energy provided by this contact may facilitate monomeric binding by receptors, thereby compensating for the stability otherwise provided by receptor dimerization. This interaction may be particularly important when P-box binding is compromised either by mutations in SF-1 or by sequence alterations in its binding site.In this particular patient, activation of the aromatase promoter by the G35E SF-1 mutant probably had little clinical significance because of multiple other deficiencies in steroidogenesis. In addition, activation of the MIS promoter may have had little effect if the dysgenetic testes had reduced capacity to produce MIS. Nevertheless, this study does indicate that a single mutation in SF-1 can exert differential effects on various target genes. This concept may also apply to other transcription factors that regulate multiple downstream target genes with variant response elements. Nuclear receptors regulate gene transcription in diverse biological systems. DNA binding specificity is crucial, therefore, so that different receptors can recognize their specific target genes appropriately. Several studies have shown that the DNA binding specificity of classic ligand-dependent nuclear receptors is determined by the P-box amino acid sequence (for example, GSV for the GR, EGA for the ER, and EGG for the TR (Fig. 4 A) (18Luisi B.F.

The acute elevation in pro-insulin levels is thought to be exclusively because of the activation of translation of pre-existing prepro-insulin mRNA. Glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription is believed to be a long term effect and should therefore not contribute to the acute elevation in pro-insulin levels. We have recently shown that glucose activates insulin gene transcription within minutes and that secreted insulin is one of the key factors triggering this process in an autocrine manner. We now provide evidence that 50% of the glucose-stimulated, acute pro-insulin biosynthesis within 30 min results from up-regulated insulin gene transcription. Our data led us to propose that glucose elevates pro-insulin levels by stimulating both transcriptional and post-transcriptional/post-translational events to an equal extent. Whereas the stimulatory effect on transcription is mediated by insulin secreted in response to glucose, glucose directly stimulates the post-transcriptional/post-translational processes.

N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine polymerase chain reaction The maintenance of glucose homeostasis in mammals is of vital importance. To keep blood glucose concentrations within narrow limits, strict regulation, and fast acting mechanisms that guarantee efficient insulin secretion and biosynthesis are necessary. In these processes, glucose itself has been shown to act as the major nutrient regulator by triggering a cascade referred to as the stimulus-response coupling. With regard to insulin biosynthesis, the commonly accepted view is that glucose exerts its immediate effect at the level of translation rather than at the level of insulin gene transcription. As a consequence of this view, glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription should be uncoupled from glucose-stimulated insulin mRNA translation. Therefore, transcription is unlikely to have an impact on the immediately triggered insulin biosynthesis. The concept or dogma of a long term effect of glucose stimulation on insulin gene transcription is challenged by Efrat et al. (1Efrat S. Surana M. Fleischer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11141-11143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by Leibiger et al. (2Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Köhler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad.

By studying the mechanisms that underlie the short term regulation of insulin gene transcription by glucose, we were able to show that insulin secreted in response to glucose stimulation is a key factor in glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription (3Leibiger I.B.

Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar). A similar observation is made in mice carrying a general knockout for insulin receptor substrate-2 (6Withers D.J. Gutierrez J.S. Towery H.

In this study, we showed that secreted insulin positively influences the acute pro-insulin biosynthesis by promoting transcription and translation. Our data provided evidence, for the first time, that short term regulated insulin gene transcription contributes to the immediate up-regulation of pro-insulin biosynthesis. Pancreatic islets were isolated from Wistar rats (200–300 g) by collagenase digestion (9Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Islets were separated by a Ficoll gradient and then hand-picked. Islet cell suspensions were prepared and washed essentially as described in Ref.10Lernmark A. Diabetologia. 1974; 10: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar. Islets and cells of disaggregated islets were incubated overnight 95% air, 5% CO2 and 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. Islets and islet cells were pretreated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 3 mm glucose, and they were supplemented as above for 90 min before the start of stimulation. Stimulation was for 15 min with either 16.7 mm glucose, 5 milliunits/ml insulin, 100 μm tolbutamide, 1 μm glibenclamide, or 50 mm KCl. Pharmacological inhibitors of voltage-gatedl-type Ca2+ channels, such as 10 μm nifedipine (Calbiochem) or DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, i.e. 5 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma), were added to the culture medium 30 min before stimulation and kept throughout stimulation. Anti-insulin antibodies (ICN) were added 30 min before stimulation to the culture medium (10 μg/ml) and kept throughout stimulation. Groups of 10 islets or 5 × 104 cells were used for each experiment. Stimulation for 15 min with either glucose, insulin, KCl, tolbutamide, or glibenclamide was performed in 2 ml of leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 μCi of l-[4,5-3H]leucine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After stimulation, the islets were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (136.9 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm KCl, 3.2 mm KH2PO4, 10.1 mm Na2HPO4·7H2O, pH 7.4) and incubated for an additional 15 min in 2 ml of leucine-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 3 mm glucose and 100 μCi ofl-[4,5-3H]leucine. After labeling, islets and cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, resuspended in 100 μl of ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm Na2B4O7, pH 9.0, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% Tween 20, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm n-[N-(l-3-trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-l-leucine]agmatine, 1 mm EDTA, 20 μm leupeptin, and 0.01% NaN3) and sonicated two times for 20 s. Immunoprecipitation with guinea pig anti-porcine insulin antibody (ICN) was performed according to Hutton et al. (11Hutton J.C. Bailyes E.M. Rhodes C.J. Guest P.C. Hutton J.C. Siddle K. Peptide Hormone Secretion: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1990: 309-336Google Scholar) using protein A-Sepharose. The washed immunoprecipitates were counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting after dispersion in 1m acetic acid containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled pro-insulin was verified by discontinuous Tricine1SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (16.5% separating gel, 10% spacer gel, 4% stacking gel) as described in Ref. 12Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar and by phosphorimaging of the dried gel. Total protein synthesis was measured in aliquots of the samples obtained for pro-insulin biosynthesis. Total protein was precipitated by the addition of 1 volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 0.15 m NaOH and counted for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. Levels of prepro-insulin mRNA were analyzed by comparative reverse transcription-PCR as described previously (2Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Köhler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol.

Levels of β-actin mRNA were analyzed by using primers 5′-AACTGGAACGGTGAAGGCGA-3′ and 5′-AACGGTCTCACGTCAGTGTA-3′. Total RNA obtained from 10 pancreatic islets was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus revertase. Aliquots of the generated cDNA were used for PCR-mediated amplification using the reverse transcription-PCR kit (Stratagene) and α-[32P]dCTP. PCR conditions were chosen that guaranteed the amplification of insulin and actin fragments within the linear range (Fig. 1 C in Ref. 2Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Köhler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). PCR was performed in an AutogeneII-thermocycler (Grant Instruments, Cambridge, U.K.) using a linked program (1 cycle of 5 min at 94 °C, 5 min at 54 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and 23–27 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 2 min at 54 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C). Labeled PCR products were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel and analyzed through phosphorimaging. Quantification was performed with TINA software 2.07d (Raytest) using co-amplified reverse transcription-PCR products for β-actin as the internal standard. Data were analyzed by Student's ttest using the software package Microcal Origin, version 5 (Microcal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). The immediate effect of elevated glucose concentration on prepro-insulin mRNA translation is well accepted (reviewed in Ref.13Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1996: 27-41Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that glucose stimulation for only 15 min resulted in a transient rise in insulin gene transcription and in a transient elevation of steady-state prepro-insulin mRNA levels (2Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Köhler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We were able to demonstrate that insulin, secreted in response to glucose stimulation, is a key factor involved in the up-regulation of insulin gene transcription (3Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Because insulin has been demonstrated as a positive regulator of protein biosynthesis in several tissues (reviewed in Ref. 14Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and in pancreatic β-cells (4Xu G. Marshall C.A. Lin T.-A. Kwon G. Munivenkatappa R.B. Hill J.R. Lawrence Jr., J.C. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4485-4491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 5Xu G.G. Rothenberg P.L. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1243-1252PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether secreted insulin also contributes to the stimulus-dependent elevation in pro-insulin biosynthesis. To address the question of whether secreted insulin contributes to pro-insulin biosynthesis, we first compared the effects of short term glucose stimulation (15 min) with that of a short term insulin stimulation at substimulatory glucose concentrations (15 min) on acute overall protein biosynthesis and acute prepro-insulin biosynthesis in isolated pancreatic islets, i.e. within a 30-min period. Therefore, we performed protein labeling with [3H]leucine in response to the stimulation of pancreatic islets for 15 min with either 16.7 mm glucose or 5 milliunits of insulin/ml at 3 mm glucose. We then harvested the islets after culturing for another 15 min at 3 mm glucose (Fig.1). Both the cultures and stimulations were performed in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. To show that the obtained effect on pro-insulin biosynthesis was a result of stimulation by either glucose or insulin rather than a result of recovery from a lack of glucose, growth factors, and amino acids, we deliberately used culture conditions where the medium was not depleted of serum, glucose, or insulin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, total protein biosynthesis was increased by the glucose stimulus up to 3-fold (average 2.08 ± 0.17, n = 11, p < 0.01) and by the insulin stimulus up to 2-fold (average 1.35 ± 0.13,n = 9, p < 0.05) within 30 min. Absolute pro-insulin biosynthesis was elevated by glucose up to 6-fold (average 3.56 ± 0.48, n = 9, p < 0.01) and by insulin up to 3-fold (average 2.07 ± 0.34,n = 5, p < 0.05), respectively. The effect of glucose and insulin stimulation on specific pro-insulin biosynthesis, i.e. after normalization to total protein biosynthesis, was up to 2-fold (average 1.6 ± 0.08,n = 10, p < 0.01) and up to 1.5-fold (average 1.32 ± 0.05, n = 9, p < 0.01), respectively (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). To evaluate whether the amount of insulin, which is necessary to stimulate pro-insulin biosynthesis, is within the physiological range, we generated a dose-response curve of exogenous insulin on pro-insulin biosynthesis. With regard to insulin gene transcription, we found a stimulatory effect when the endogenous insulin release was higher than 10 microunits/ml per 10 islets per 15 min (3Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The range for endogenous release upon stimulation with 16.7 mm glucose was quite broad and could reach levels of up to 100 microunits/ml per 10 islets per 15 min. Therefore, we analyzed the necessary amounts of exogenous insulin to stimulate pro-insulin biosynthesis when culturing islets in the medium without serum, i.e. medium supplemented with bovine serum albumin. As shown in Fig. 1 B, the addition of 10 microunits of insulin/ml of medium (i.e. 60 pmol) was necessary to significantly increase pro-insulin biosynthesis within a 30-min period. The addition of 30 microunits/ml (i.e. 180 pmol) triggered the maximal response. Next we wanted to know the necessary amount of exogenous insulin to stimulate pro-insulin biosynthesis when culturing islets in fully supplemented medium. As illustrated in Fig. 1 C, here also the addition of 10 microunits of insulin/ml of medium was necessary to significantly increase pro-insulin biosynthesis within a 30-min period. Addition of exogenous insulin above the physiological range did not lead to a further increase in pro-insulin biosynthesis. To test whether endogenous insulin that secreted upon stimulation had a similar effect as exogenous insulin, we next stimulated the isolated pancreatic islets for 15 min with 50 mm KCl at 3 mm glucose. This allowed insulin secretion without the additional effects of glucose metabolism. Indeed, KCl-stimulated insulin secretion resulted in a similar 55% elevation of specific pro-insulin biosynthesis within 30 min (Fig.2 A). To exclude an unspecific effect of KCl and to further demonstrate that insulin secreted by the β-cell promotes pro-insulin biosynthesis, we tested the effects of classical insulin secretagogues, i.e. the sulfonylurea compounds, tolbutamide and glibenclamide, on acute pro-insulin biosynthesis. Indeed, stimulation with either 100 μmtolbutamide or 1 μm glibenclamide at 3 mmglucose led to a similar amount of increase in pro-insulin biosynthesis as obtained by the addition of exogenous insulin (Fig. 2 B) or stimulation with 50 mm KCl (Fig. 2 A). To test the effects of glucose metabolism without the additional effects of secreted insulin, we stimulated islet cells for 15 min with 16.7 mm glucose but blocked the depolarization-mediated influx of Ca2+ via voltage-gatedl-type Ca2+ channels and the subsequent insulin secretion by treatment with 10 μm nifedipine. This protocol has been shown to abolish the Ca2+ influx vial-type Ca2+ channels and to completely block insulin secretion (15Malaisse W.J. Boschero A.C. Horm. Res. (Basel). 1977; 8: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 C, nifedipine treatment decreased glucose-stimulated, pro-insulin biosynthesis by roughly 50%. So far our data suggest that neither secreted insulin nor glucose metabolism per se can account for the total effect on acute glucose-stimulated, pro-insulin biosynthesis, but each of the stimuli had an impact of approximately 50%. If both effects were independent, they should be additive. To test this hypothesis, we stimulated pancreatic islets with 16.7 mm glucose and blocked secretion of endogenous insulin with 10 μm nifedipine but substituted the insulin effect by administering 5 milliunits/ml exogenous insulin together with the sugar. As shown in Fig.2 C (16.7 glc + nif + insulin), exogenous insulin could restore glucose-induced, pro-insulin biosynthesis in the presence of nifedipine, indeed demonstrating that the effects of glucose metabolism and insulin feedback were additive. To finally prove that insulin secreted by the pancreatic β-cell is promoting pro-insulin biosynthesis, we stimulated insulin secretion by 16.7 mm glucose but absorbed the secreted insulin with anti-insulin antibodies. The antibodies were added 30 min before stimulation and were kept throughout stimulation in the culture medium (10 μg/ml). This approach resulted in approximately a 50% reduction in pro-insulin biosynthesis (Fig. 2 D). Next we wanted to test the impact of the short term glucose/insulin-stimulated insulin gene transcription on the immediate glucose/insulin-stimulated pro-insulin biosynthesis. As shown in Fig.3 A, already 15 min after glucose stimulation, prepro-insulin mRNA steady state levels were elevated by 40%, increasing further with time. By performing a nuclear run-off assay on islets, we found a 3.5-fold elevation in insulin gene transcription initiation 45 min after the start of stimulation (data not shown). To evaluate the importance of insulin gene transcription, we combined glucose/insulin stimulation with actinomycin D treatment. This approach allowed stimulus-dependent translation but blocked renewed synthesis of mRNA. Indeed, blocking transcription through actinomycin D treatment led to a decrease in pro-insulin biosynthesis by approximately 50% (Fig. 3 B, compare 16.7 glc versus 16.7 glc + actD). Moreover, actinomycin D in combination with exogenous insulin at substimulatory glucose concentrations almost abolished an increase in pro-insulin biosynthesis (Fig. 3 B, compare 3.0 glc + insulin versus 3.0 glc + insulin + actD). This observation led us to suggest that part of the glucose effect on specific pro-insulin biosynthesis is independent of acute insulin gene transcription and reflects glucose-stimulated translation of pre-existing prepro-insulin mRNA. On the other hand, the insulin effect seems to be directly dependent on acute transcription. That the newly transcribed prepro-insulin mRNA is accessible for translation within a 30-min period is in agreement with the data presented here (Fig. 3 A) as well as with earlier findings, which show that an elevation in cytoplasmic prepro-insulin mRNA steady state levels can be observed as early as 10 min after the start of glucose stimulation (1Efrat S. Surana M. Fleischer N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11141-11143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Leibiger B. Moede T. Schwarz T. Brown G.R. Köhler M. Leibiger I.B. Berggren P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9307-9312Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Glucose stimulation of insulin-producing cells has been shown to result in an increase in the biosynthesis rate of more than 50 proteins including insulin (16Guest P.C. Bailyes E.M. Rutherford N.G. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To what extent this effect is due to a ”glucose“effect, ”insulin“ effect, or effect on transcription or translation (or both) remains to be clarified for each individual protein. Both glucose and insulin have been shown to stimulate transcription and translation in several tissues (reviewed in Refs. 17O'Brian R.M. Granner D.K. Biochem. J. 1991; 278: 609-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholarand 14Proud C.G. Denton R.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 329-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, respectively). In this study we show that insulin, secreted in response to glucose stimulation, positively affects acute pro-insulin biosynthesis in an autocrine manner. Both glucose and insulin have a stimulatory effect on total protein biosynthesis as well as on absolute pro-insulin biosynthesis (the effect of glucose being more pronounced than that of insulin). As illustrated in Fig. 4, our data led us to propose that glucose elevates specific pro-insulin levels by stimulating both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional/post-translational events to an almost equal extent. The glucose dependence of the post-transcriptional/post-translational processes, such as the translocation of prepro-insulin, mRNA-bound ribosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum, the initiation, and the elongation in prepro-insulin mRNA translation, is in agreement with earlier reports (reviewed in Ref. 13Rhodes C.J. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. Lippincott Williams and Wilkins, Philadelphia, PA1996: 27-41Google Scholar). Although we cannot totally exclude a direct effect of glucose/glucose metabolism on insulin gene transcription, the activation of glucose metabolism is mediated via glucose-stimulated exocytosis of insulin and the positive paracrine feedback of insulin as described previously (3Leibiger I.B. Leibiger B. Moede T. Berggren P.O. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 933-938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate for the first time that glucose-stimulated insulin gene transcription directly contributes to the immediately triggered pro-insulin biosynthesis. The involvement of insulin signaling in stimulation-dependent pro-insulin biosynthesis supports the new evolving concept that the pancreatic β-cell itself is a target for insulin and that the positive autocrine feedback loop contributes to β-cell physiology.

One is a chitodextrinase (11Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33414-33424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the other is a β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (12Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The concerted action of these two enzymes yields GlcNAc and (GlcNAc)2 from the higher oligosaccharides, which are then taken up by specific cytoplasmic membrane transporters (9Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33457-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 10Bouma C.L. Roseman S. J. Biol.

But how do the higher oligosaccharides penetrate the outer membrane/cell wall complex so that they can be hydrolyzed in the periplasm? There is an extensive literature on outer membrane proteins or porins that are thought to mediate this process (16Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3905-3908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Benz R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1988; 42: 359-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The nonspecific, constitutive porins of Escherichia coli permit the diffusion of solutes that range up to about 600 Da (19Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), depending on shape, or roughly the size of a trisaccharide. A few sugar-specific porins, or glycoporins, have been reported. These include, most notably, the LamB protein or λ phage receptor protein, whose crystal structure has been resolved (20Schirmer T. Keller T.A. Wang Y.-F. Rosenbusch J.P. Science. 1995; 267: 512-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and which permits the diffusion of malto-oligosaccharides (21Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Wang Y.F. Dutzler R. Rizkallah P.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Schirmer T. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 57-63Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and ScrY, involved in sucrose transport (23Schmid K. Ebner R. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Titgemeyer F. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 941-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The RafY protein is involved in raffinose uptake (24Ulmke C. Lengeler J.W. Schmid K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5783-5788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and may not have a specific binding site for the trisaccharide but functions because it is wider than the constitutive E. coliporins (25Andersen C. Krones D. Ulmke C. Schmid K. Benz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 254: 679-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The present report presents evidence for another glycoporin designated chitoporin. The porin is expressed by V. furnissii in its outer membrane and is induced by chitin oligosaccharides but not by GlcNAc nor by other sugars. The structural gene for the porin,chiP, has been cloned, and its sequence was determined and expressed in E. coli. The physiological behavior of a null mutant of chiP in V. furnissii provided additional evidence that ChiP is a specific chitoporin. Buffers, reagents, and cell culture media were purchased from commercial sources and were of the highest purity available. The following reagents were purchased from designated sources: HEPES (Research Organics Inc., Cleveland, OH), GF/F glass microfiber filters (Whatman), N-lauryl sarcosine (Sigma), [14C]N-acetylglucosamine (CFA.485, 60 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chitin oligosaccharides (GlcNAc)n, n = 2–6,2 were prepared by a previously published method (26Horowitz S.T. Roseman S. Blumenthal H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 5046-5049Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) or obtained from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville, MD). Methyl β-N,N′-[3H]diacetylthiochitobiose ([3H]Me-TCB or Me-TCB) was prepared (13Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and purchased from Genemed (San Francisco, CA). Purified phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose transferase (PTS) general proteins, Enzyme I and HPr were kind gifts from Dr. Norman Meadow. The strains and plasmids used are given in TableI. E. coli strains were grown in LB or on Luria Agar plates supplemented with 50–75 μg/ml ampicillin where appropriate for selection of recombinants. Cell cultures were grown at 37 °C, with aeration and turbidity measured at 600 nm. At this wavelength, 1.0 optical density unit corresponds to 0.5 mg of cell protein/ml. V. furnissii strains were grown either in high salt LB (LMB, Luria broth supplemented with an additional 10 g/liter NaCl) or in minimal media containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.5), 50% artificial sea water (ASW), 0.1% NH4Cl, 0.001% K2HPO4, and 0.5%dl-lactate (lactate-ASW) (8Bassler B.L., Yu, C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal medium was supplemented with other carbon sources as indicated. Cell cultures were grown at 30 °C with aeration and growth measured by absorbance at 540 nm; 1.0 optical density corresponds to 0.5 mg of cell protein/ml. Growth curves were obtained by growing primary inocula overnight in LMB and diluting 1:100 in the indicated media.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsDescriptionSourceStrains V. furnissii1514Wild typeRef. 15Yu C.

Open table in a new tab DNA preparation and analysis, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (28). A cosmid library was constructed using bacterial genomic DNA fromV. furnissii 1514 as described (28). Library construction, including conditions for partial genomic DNA restriction (usingSau3AI) and ligation into the cosmid vector Supercos1, was performed as recommended (Stratagene). The ligation mixture was packaged into λ phage using GigaPack Gold III packaging extract (Stratagene). Transfections into various E. coli strains were performed according to the supplier's recommendations. Double-stranded DNA was prepared from recombinant clones and sequenced by the dideoxy method using U.S. Biochemical Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit or alternately by the Genetics Core Facility (Johns Hopkins Medical School) using an ABI-373 automated sequencer. Unless otherwise indicated, the following procedures were conducted between 0 and 4 °C. Outer membrane fractions were prepared from mid-exponential phase cells (29McCarter L.L. Silverman M. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3441-3449Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Filip C. Fletcher G. Wulff J.L. Earhart C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 717-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Typically, 5–10-ml cultures were harvested (7500 × g, 5 min), washed once with the same volume of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm EDTA, 15% sucrose), and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme. Samples were maintained on ice for 30 min in a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at maximum speed for 15 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold 1% N-lauryl sarcosine to solubilize the inner membrane fraction. The sample was passed through a 22-gauge needle 5–10 times and centrifuged for 15 min, and the supernatant fluid was discarded. The pellet was washed either with 1% lauryl sarcosine or with H2O. SDS-PAGE loading buffer (20–100 μl) was added to the pellet, and samples were boiled for 5 min before being subjected to SDS-PAGE (28). Outer membrane enriched fractions were prepared from mid-exponential phase cells that were first treated by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. N-Lauryl sarcosine was then added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min (31Forst S. Delgado J. Ramakrishnan G. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 5080-5085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min; the supernatant fraction was then centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and processed as described above for Method 1. Inner and outer membranes from V. furnissii were prepared essentially as described (32Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Briefly, mid-exponential cells, grown in lactate-ASW medium with and without 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2, were harvested at 12,000 ×g, 10 min, washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm EDTA and 15% sucrose, and resuspended in the same buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme. Samples were maintained on ice for 30 min, then slowly poured into four volumes of ice-cold sterile distilled H2O with rapid stirring, and stirred for an additional 10 min. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 360,000 × g for 2 h, and the pellet was resuspended in the same volume of buffer without lysozyme and passed through a 22-gauge needle 5–7 times. The membranes were harvested at 360,000 × g, resuspended in 25% sucrose containing 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, layered on top of a 30–55% sucrose gradient, and centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 16 h. Fractions were collected by piercing the bottom of the centrifuge tubes and allowing the liquid to flow out. The buoyant density of each fraction was determined from measurements of the refractive index. β-GlcNAcidase activity was measured either discontinuously or continuously using PNP-GlcNAc 3Glycosides are indicated by combinations of abbreviations, such as PNP-GlcNAc; unless otherwise indicated the anomeric configuration is β. (Sigma) as described (8Bassler B.L., Yu, C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gradient fractions from the inner/outer-membrane isolation procedure were assayed for 3-deoxyoctulosonic acid (KDO) as described (32Osborn M.J. Munson R. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 642-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions (100 μl) were precipitated with 1 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of distilled H2O, resuspended in 0.1 ml of 0.02n H2SO4, and hydroyzed for 20 min at 100 °C. The hydrolysates were analyzed for KDO using the thiobarbituric acid method. Fractions from bacterial inner and outer membranes were assayed for phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent GlcNAc phosphorylation catalyzed by the PTS system (33Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Each assay mixture contained the following components in 0.2 ml: 0.1 ml of the membrane fraction to be assayed, 2–5 units of homogeneous Enzyme I, 3–5 μm HPr, 125 μg of bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mmpotassium-phosphoenolpyruvate, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mmKF, and 2 mm [14C]GlcNAc (315 dpm/nmol). The assay mixtures were incubated for 15 or 30 min at 37 °C and heated for 5 min at 100 °C. GlcNAc-6-P was determined by anion exchange chromatography (35Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The protein band observed on SDS gels was electroblotted to an Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After transfer, the blot was lightly stained with Coomassie Blue, and the band was cut out. The N-terminal sequence of the protein was determined at the Biosynthesis and Sequencing Facility (Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine) using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer. The putative chitoporin gene, chiP, was cloned using a two-step strategy. First, primers were designed based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence and used to clone the 90 base pairs corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the N terminus. Then the N-terminal nucleotide fragment was used as a probe for screening a recombinant V. furnissii cosmid library inE. coli. Three degenerate oligonucleotide probes were synthesized based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of ChiP: (a) primer O1, GGCGGAATTC AARGARGTNGGNGT; the sequence in bold is derived from amino acids 1–5, and an EcoRI site inserted for use in cloning is underlined; (b) Primer O2,GHGTSTAYGGNGTSGCSGCSATG (amino acids 12–19); and (c) primer O3, TTRTGNCTRTTR CCTAGGGGG; the sequence in bold is derived from amino acids 25–29,i.e. direction of primer is opposite to O1, and aBamHI cloning site is underlined. Primers O1 and O3 were used to amplify a 90-base pair N-terminal fragment of chiPby polymerase chain reaction from V. furnissii genomic DNA. The polymerase chain reaction generated fragments were subcloned into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of vector pBluescript II KS(+), and colonies were screened for those containing the correct insert by hybridization to primer O2. Three such isolates designated pKS-X1, pKS-X2, and pKS-X3 were picked, and their inserts were sequenced. All three contained the DNA sequence that encoded the desired amino acid sequence. The N-terminal nucleotide fragment (designated N90f) was cut from pKS-X1 (using EcoRI andBamHI) and random primer-labeled with [α-32P]dATP according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radiolabeled probe was used to screen a recombinant V. furnissii cosmid library and two positive clones, designated as pL7 and pL8, containing 25–30-kb inserts were isolated by colony hybridization from approximately 3000 recombinant clones. Restriction analysis showed that both isolates shared many similar restriction fragments and a 4.2-kbEcoRI-HindIII fragment hybridized to N90f in both isolates as detected using a Southern blot. Attempts to subclone this fragment yielded a variety of deletions, and the intact 4.2-kb piece could not be cloned. The putative porin gene was, therefore, sequenced by subcloning fragments of the 4.2-kb piece using a combination of various restriction enzymes and polymerase chain reaction. Based on the sequences of the fragments, it was possible to derive the nucleotide sequence of the complete gene. This deduced sequence was confirmed by designing the appropriate primers and resequencing the entire 4.2-kb fragment using the original template (pL7). The chiP open reading frame was subsequently subcloned into the expression vectors pET21a and pIH1148 using appropriate primers based on the nucleotide sequence. A knock-out or null mutant of chiP was constructed inV. furnissii by homologous recombination between a cloned fragment of chiP (constructed in the suicide vector pNQ705) and the V. furnissii genome (36Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Briefly, this method involves conjugal transfer of plasmids from an E. colimobilizing donor (strain S17-1) to V. furnissii. A fragment of the target gene is subcloned into the vector pNQ705, which contains an antibiotic resistance marker and is capable of propagating only in the E. coli host and not in the Vibrio (37Simon R. Priefer U. Puhler A. Bio/Technology. 1983; 1: 784-791Crossref Scopus (5611) Google Scholar). Conjugal transfer is achieved simply by mixing the two cell types together and then selecting against the E. coli host (amps, V. furnissii is resistant up to 30 μg/ml ampicillin) and for the selective marker (chloramphenicol resistance) on the (transferred) vector. Because the vector is incapable of propagating in V. furnissii, the chloramphenicol selective pressure results in recombination, giving the desired null mutant (36Miller V.L. Mekalanos J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2575-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar, 38Milton D.L. Norqvist A. Wolf-Watz H. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7235-7244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the efficient construction of transformants with plasmids generated in E. coli, it was necessary to overcome the restriction barrier in V. furnissii. The restriction system was found to be similar to Sau96I (commercially available), and resistance to this system is effected in V. furnissiiby a methylation modification system. To appropriately modify the plasmids, the V. furnissii methylase gene was cloned intoE. coli strain S17-1, and plasmids were propagated in this strain prior to their use for transforming V. furnissii. 4A. Fomenkov, unpublished results. A 0.3-kb fragment (NdeI-ScaI) of the N-terminal portion of chiP was isolated from pET-chiP, blunt ended using the appropriate nucleotides and Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), and subcloned into the EcoRV site of pNQ705, yielding pNQ-X300. The suicide plasmid, pNQ-X300, containing 0.3 kb of the porin gene was transferred into V. furnissii by transconjugation, using the conjugative E. colistrain S17-1. The latter was cotransformed with the suicide vector pNQ-X300 (which can propagate in this strain) and a compatible plasmid bearing the cloned V. furnissii DNA-methylase gene. The resultant double transformant was used in conjugation experiments withV. furnissii. Briefly, E. coli and V. furnissii, were inoculated and grown separately under appropriate conditions. V. furnissii 1514 was grown in 50 ml of LMB at 30 °C to an A 540 = 0.8; E. coli S17-1 cells harboring pNQ-X300 and pVfu129 (the methylase gene) were grown in 50 ml of LB at 37 °C supplemented with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin to anA 600 = 0.8. Aliquots containing 2 × 109 cells of each species were pipetted onto LMB plates (no antibiotics) and allowed to grow for 24 h at room temperature. The cocultured E. coli and V. furnissii cells were resuspended in 1.5–2.0 ml of LMB, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were transferred to LMB plates containing 30 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The desired V. furnissiirecombinants are ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant, individual colonies were picked, and a single colony was purified. The V. furnissii chiP gene was cloned into the mobilizable vector pSF4 (kind gift of Dr. V. N. Iyer, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada) in a two step procedure. Primers were first constructed to clone chiP into theNdeI and BamHI sites of pIH1148 immediately following the Ptac promoter present on the plasmid. The fragment containing chiP fused to the Ptac promoter was then cloned into the PstI site of pSF4 using polymerase chain reaction and two newly designed primers. The primers used for the cloning were as follows: (a) for cloning into pIH1148: CW, 5′-CGGGCGCGCCATATGGACAAAATGTTTA-3′, and CCW, 5′-CGGGGATCCATTAGAAACCGTACTCTAGAC-3′ and (b) for cloning into pSF4: CW, 5′-GGCCGAATGCATGTTTGACAGCTTATC-3′, and CCW, 5′-TAGTGATGCATAAGCTTGCCTGCAGGTCG-3′. The sequences in bold refer to NdeI, BamHI, NsiI, and NsiI sites on the given primers, respectively. It should be noted that NsiI and PstI result in compatible ends allowing for ligation into the PstI site of pSF4 giving pSF-chiP. pSF-chiP was tranferred into V. furnissii X1401 (chiP − null mutant) by transconjugation as described above. The rate of [3H]Me-TCB uptake by V. furnissii was measured essentially as described (13Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol.

Briefly, V. furnissii was grown overnight in LMB and diluted 50-fold in lactate-50% ASW salts minimal media supplemented with 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2 (induced) or as indicated. Cells were grown at 30 °C with aeration to anA 540 = 0.8–1.2, washed three times at 4 °C with an equal volume of buffered 50% ASW salts, and resuspended in buffered 50% ASW salts or in 0.4 m sucrose containing 50 mm KCl, using 125 to 150 the volume of the growth medium. The suspension was stored on ice and transferred to room temperature 15 min prior to use. Transport experiments were conducted no later than 2 h after harvesting and washing of the cells. Uptake was initiated by the addition of an equal volume of cell suspension to [3H]Me-TCB dissolved in the same buffer as the cell suspension. Substrate concentrations ranged from 0.5 to 100 μm. The cell suspension was rapidly mixed at room temperature, and aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken at various times, added to 10 ml of wash (HEPES-buffered 50% ASW) at room temperature and filtered through Whatman GF/F glass microfiber filters. After washing with an additional 10 ml of buffer, the cells on the filter were solubilized with Packard Soluene-350 and counted in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. Three different procedures were employed for the isolation of outer membrane enriched fractions from V. furnissii cells grown in lactate with 50% ASW with and without 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2. Fig.1 illustrates the protein pattern from membranes prepared by Method 1. After induction by growth on (GlcNAc)2, a major new band was observed with an apparent molecular mass of 40 kDa, and representing 10–20% of the total Coomassie-stained protein.

This vast quantity of highly insoluble polymer is degraded so rapidly that only traces are found in marine sediments. Work in the 1930s showed that marine bacteria, such asVibrios, were primarily responsible for this massive turnover (6Zobell C.E. Rittenberg S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1937; 35: 275-287Crossref Google Scholar). The enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin has been studied for almost a century, and early work (7Zechmeister L. Tóth G. Enzymologia. 1939; 7: 165-169Google Scholar, 8Zechmeister L. Tóth G. Vajda E. Enzymologia. 1939; 7: 170-175Google Scholar) established that two enzymes were required, a chitinase that yielded the disaccharideN,N′-diacetylchitobiose, or (GlcNAc)2,1 and a “chitobiase”, or β-N-acetylglucosaminidase, which gave the final product GlcNAc. This pathway has remained the central concept for chitin catabolism through the 20th century (9Wood, W. A., and Kellog, S. T. (1988) Methods Enzymol. 161.Google Scholar), including in marine bacteria (10Soto-Gil R.W. Zyskind J.W. Zikakis J.P. Chitin, Chitosan and Related Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984Google Scholar). We have reported that chitin catabolism in the marine bacteriumVibrio furnissii is much more complex, involving a minimum of three signal transduction systems and many genes and proteins, only some of which have been identified (11Bassler B.L.

In this process, extracellular chitin is partially hydrolyzed by extracellular chitinases, and the oligosaccharides diffuse through a chitoporin (1Keyhani N.O. Li X. Roseman S. J. Biol.

The combined action of two unique enzymes in the periplasm, a chitodextrinase (17Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol.

In our earlier work (12Bassler B.L., Yu, C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), crude extracts of V. furnissiiwere shown to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl-β-GlcNAc, and the enzyme was assumed to be a typical bacterial chitobiase (10Soto-Gil R.W. Zyskind J.W. Zikakis J.P. Chitin, Chitosan and Related Enzymes. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1984Google Scholar). Numerous unsuccessful attempts were made to clone this enzyme. Instead, an atypical periplasmic β-N-acetylglucosaminidase was identified (18Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which has virtually no activity on (GlcNAc)2 at the pH of sea water. The present studies were based on the same approach, an attempt to clone the hypothetical chitobiase. We have, instead, cloned, isolated, and characterized a novel enzyme, a specific (GlcNAc)2phosphorylase that catalyzes the following reaction.(GlcNAc) 2+Pi⇌GlcNAc­α­1­P+GlcNAcREACTION 2 The following chemicals, reagents, and materials were purchased from the indicated sources: chitin, GlcNAc, PNP-glycosides 3The PNP-glycosides are all of the β-anomeric configuration. were from Sigma; chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAc)n (n = 2–6) were prepared by N-acetylation of chitosan oligosaccharides prepared as described (21Horowitz S.T. Roseman S. Blumenthal H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1957; 79: 5046-5049Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) or were purchased from Seikagaku America, Inc. (Rockville, MD); reagents for bacterial media were from Difco and J. T. Baker. Radioisotope (32Pi) was purchased from ICN. Reagents for molecular biology were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverely, MA), Stratagene, and U.S. Biochemical Corp. Other buffers and reagents were of the highest purity available commercially. Escherichia coli strains BL21 (DE3) (Novagen) and XL1-Blue (Stratagene) harboring designated plasmid constructs where indicated were stored as frozen cultures in LB with 5% glycerol. Cell densities were measured at 600 nm, where 1 optical density unit corresponded to 0.5 mg of cell protein. DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digests, ligation, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (22, 23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A cosmid library was constructed using bacterial genomic DNA fromV. furnissii strain 1514 as described. Library construction, including conditions for partial genomic DNA restriction (usingSau3A) and ligation into the cosmid vector SuperCos1 were performed according to the supplier's recommendations (Stratagene). The ligation mixture was packaged into λ phage using GigaPack Gold III packaging extract (Stratagene) and transfected into variousE. coli strains (typically XL1-Blue) according to the supplier's recommendations. The recombinant V. furnissii cosmid library in E. coli strain XL1-Blue was screened by hybridization using a fragment from the previously cloned V. furnissii periplasmic β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (ExoI) as a probe using standard techniques. Briefly, a 3.7-kilobaseClaI-NcoI fragment corresponding to the clonedexoI gene was labeled ([α-32P]dATP, 3,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by random priming (random primed DNA labeling kit; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as a probe in colony lifts from the recombinant cosmid library. A total of three positive clones were isolated from a screen of 1,000 recombinants. Restriction analysis of the three clones revealed inserts of approximately 25–35 kilobases, with the clones sharing many similar sized bands when digested by several different restriction enzymes. One clone, designated as pRhexo, was chosen for further study. The nucleotide sequence downstream (3′ end) of exoI was determined at the Genetics Core Facility (Johns Hopkins Medical School) using an ABI-373 automated sequencer. DNA and amino acid sequence analyses were performed using the GCG sequence analysis package (version 7; Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). The GenBankTM data base and the SWISS-PROT Data Base were used for nucleotide and amino acid sequence searches using the FASTA program. The (GlcNAc)2 phosphorylase gene, chbP, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers based on the gene sequence determined from the cosmid clone, pRhexo. The 5′ polymerase chain reaction primer was designed containing a NdeI restriction site to facilitate cloning into the start site following a T7 promoter in the overexpression vector pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The primers used to construct the overexpression plasmid were 5′-GGAAATTCATATGAAATACGGCTATTT-3′ and 5′-ATTTCGAATTAACCTAAAATCACCGTG-3′. The amplified polymerase chain reaction fragment (2.4 kilobases) corresponding to chbP was first blunt-end cloned into pNotA (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO), before being transferred into the NdeI (5′ end) andSacI (3′ end) of pET21a. The constructed vector, pET:chbP, was transformed into the T7 polymerase inducible host strain BL21 (DE3) for overexpression of the protein product. Two quantitative assays used were to measure phosphorolytic enzyme activity: (a) incorporation of32Pi into the product, which required separation from the large excess of 32Pi, and (b) the Morgan-Elson reaction employed for determiningN-acetylglucosamine. The method is based on heating the sugar at alkaline pH to form a chromophore, which then reacts withp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde to give a purple color. A positive reaction requires that the GlcNAc C-1 carbonyl group be free. Substitutions along the chain of the GlcNAc greatly influences the reaction, particularly at C-4. For this reason, (GlcNAc)2gives only 3–6% of the color yield obtained with GlcNAc, and higher oligosaccharides are unreactive with this reagent (reviewed in Ref.24Foster A.B. Webber J.M. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. 1960; 15: 385-386Google Scholar). Enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C, and in all assays, product formation was proportional to time of incubation and the quantity of enzyme used. Control incubation mixtures lacked enzyme, contained heat denatured enzyme, or lacked one of the two substrates (GlcNAc)2 or 32Pi. These controls gave the base-line color levels for the Morgan-Elson method. Assay mixtures (100 μl) contained the following: 0.01–5.0 mm sugar substrate, 0.01–5.0 mm32Pi (500 cpm/nmol), 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 mm KCl. Reactions were initiated by adding purified enzyme (0.5–2.0 μg). The reactions were stopped, and32Pi was selectively precipitated by treating with 100 μl of precipitation mixture (200 mm sodium tungstate, 200 mm triethylammonium hydrochloride, and 50 mm procaine hydrochloride) followed by 20 μl of formic acid (25Bochner B.R. Ames B.N. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 122: 100-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The mixture was maintained at 4 °C for 5 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The supernatant containing the product GlcNAc-1-32P was quantitated in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer (50 μl of supernatant and 3.0 ml of UltimaGold-XR). One product of the phosphorolysis of (GlcNAc)2 is GlcNAc. To assay for this monosaccharide, the incubation mixtures were increased to twice the volumes described above, and 100-μl samples were removed at the indicated times, heated at 100 °C for 5 min to stop the reaction, cooled, treated with 100 μl of sodium borate, pH 9.2, heated at 100 °C for 12 min, cooled to room temperature, and finally treated with 550 μl of the Ehrlich Reagent (26Roseman S. Daffner I. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 1743-1746Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Comb D.G. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2529-2537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. SDS-PAGE was preformed as described (22, 23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). A single colony of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) harboring pET:chbP was inoculated into 150 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C with aeration. Two liters each of LB medium supplemented with 3 mm melibiose (final concentration) in two 6-liter flasks were inoculated with 40 ml of the overnight culture and allowed to grow at 37 °C with aeration untilA 600 = 3.0. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise specified. The cell pellet (8 gm) was washed twice with 800 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and finally resuspended in 35 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. The cells were disrupted by two passages through a Wabash French Press. Unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 20 min. Nucleic acids were precipitated using streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of 10% stock solution/ml of crude extract) added dropwise with stirring to the supernatant fluid of Step 1. The mixture was stirred for an additional 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Proteins in the streptomycin sulfate treated supernatant (40 ml) were precipitated by the dropwise addition of saturated ammonium sulfate solution to a final concentration of 60%. The solution was stirred overnight and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The ammonium sulfate pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, and dialyzed against the same buffer. The 60% ammonium sulfate fraction was transferred to a 40-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer with 10 mm NaCl pH 7.0 buffer. After sample loading, the column was washed with two volumes (80 ml) of buffer, and a gradient (400 ml) from 0.01 to 1.0 m NaCl was applied to the column. The activity eluted between 0.4 and 0.6 m NaCl, and active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mm NaCl. The pooled sample from Step 4 was transferred to a Mono-Q HR 10/10 (8 ml bed volume) FPLC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 10 mmNaCl. The column was washed at room temperature with 10 ml of the same buffer and subsequently eluted with a gradient (160 ml) from 0.01 to 1.0 m NaCl in the same buffer. Purified (GlcNAc)2 phosphorylase eluted between 0.4 and 0.5m NaCl. Purity was monitored throughout the fractionation by SDS-PAGE and enzyme activity. The purified enzyme was stored in small aliquots at −20 or −80 °C. The N-terminal amino acid residues of purified recombinant ChiP were determined using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer (Amino Acid Sequencing Facility, Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). The effects of these parameters on enzyme activity were studied with the purified enzyme at 30 °C to determine the optimal conditions for kinetic characterization. Both assay methods (incorporation of 32Pi into product and the Morgan-Elson) were alternately used and always gave complementary results. Typically, 5 mm substrate concentrations were employed for both (GlcNAc)2 and phosphate. The following buffer systems were used to generate a wide pH range: citrate buffer (pH 3.0–6.5), imidazole buffer (pH 6.5–7.7), TAPS buffer (pH 7.7–9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5–10.0). Where possible, overlapping pH ranges were used with different buffers. The effect of ionic strength on enzyme activity was determined using buffer 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, supplemented with NaCl or KCl at various concentrations, ranging from 0 to 2 m. The optimum temperature and thermostability of the enzyme were investigated using (GlcNAc)2 as the substrate. The optimum temperature was determined by incubating reaction mixtures as described above, over a temperature range of 0–75 °C. Reaction mixtures were preincubated at the given temperatures before addition of purified enzyme (0.5–2.0 μg). The thermostability of the enzyme was measured by addition of purified enzyme to 100 μl of buffer without substrate, incubating at the desired temperature for 20 min, cooling to room temperature, and then initiating reactions by the addition of substrate. Formation of GlcNAc-1-P or GlcNAc was determined as described above. The major problem in preparing the sugar phosphate on a large scale was the separation of excess Pi from the product. Shaking the incubation mixture with a large excess of BaCO3removed about 90% of the Pi. A more satisfactory method is described below. The reaction mixture contained 200 mg of (GlcNAc)2 (471 μmol) in 15 ml of 1.0 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by adding 3 mg of purified ChbP, incubated at 30 °C for 2 h, and stopped by boiling for 5 min. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation (7, 500 ×g, 10 min), and the volume was adjusted to 200 ml with H2O. Inorganic and total phosphate were measured as described (28Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; VIII: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). The solution was treated with a 5-fold molar excess Ca(OH)2relative to total Pi in the reaction (5.0 g of Ca(OH)2). The mixture was stirred at 22 °C for 1 h, after which the insoluble material was removed by filtration. This treatment resulted in the removal of greater than 99% of the Pi. The supernatant material, containing ∼250 μmol of sugar phosphate, was transferred to a Dowex-1 AGX8 resin column (10 ml, bicarbonate form), the column was washed with water, and the phospho-sugar was purified by eluting with a 0–1.0 mgradient (200 ml) of triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, or a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl, pH 7.8. The NaCl gradient gave a sharper separation between residual Pi and GlcNAc-1-P. Most of the NaCl was removed from the pooled fractions by dialysis against a 100-dalton cut-off membrane. The product prepared by the NaCl method were used in the kinetic studies described below; the residual NaCl did not affect the enzyme kinetics. Fractions were analyzed for GlcNAc, Pi, and organic phosphate and by TLC. The fractions containing the phospho-sugar (290 μmol) were pooled (45 ml), evaporated (repeatedly to remove triethylammonium bicarbonate when present), and lyophilized. The final products were syrups, and exhibited single bands by TLC on Silica gel 60 using the following solvent system: chloroform:methanol:water (55:40:5). When used in the studies described below, the syrup was dissolved in water, and the concentration of GlcNAc-1-P was determined by analyzing for organic (and inorganic) P. Samples of the purified sugar phosphate were very kindly analyzed by matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization mass spectroscopy by S. Ramirez and Dr. R. Kotter (Middle Atlantic Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Department of Pharmacology, Johns-Hopkins University School of Medicine). 1H and 31P NMR spectra were obtained and interpreted by Drs. I. Deras, Lai-Xi Wang, and Y. C. Lee (Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University) using a Brucker AMX-300 spectrometer at 25 °C. The reverse reaction was measured by quantitation of Pi liberated from GlcNAc-1-P (donor) in the presence of various carbohydrate acceptors. The initial sugar (total organic) phosphate concentration was determined as described (28Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; VIII: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). Typical reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained; 0.1–10 mmGlcNAc-1-P and 0.1–10 mm potential acceptor in 50 mm MES buffer, pH 6.2. Reactions were initiated by the addition of ChbP (0.5–2.0 μg), incubated over a time course (typically 0.5 min to 2 h), and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. The initial sugar phosphate (organic phosphate) and inorganic phosphate was measured as described (28Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1966; VIII: 115-118Crossref Scopus (3031) Google Scholar). Reaction conditions such as temperature and pH optima were determined as described for the forward reaction. The K′eq of the reaction in the forward direction was measured using (GlcNAc)2 and Pi as the substrates and determining the final concentrations of Pi, GlcNAc, and GlcNAc-1-P. Typical reaction mixtures contained 25 nmol each of (GlcNAc)2 and 32Pi (specific activity, 500–1000 cpm/nmol) in 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. Reactions were initiated by adding purified enzyme (0.5–2.0 μg), and aliquots were taken over a time course of 0–24 h. Free32Pi and sugar phosphate (GlcNAc-1-32P) were separated and quantitated by selective precipitation with Ca(OH)2 as described above. The quenched reaction was maintained at 4 °C for 5 min, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 10 min, 4 °C) using a tabletop microcentrifuge. The precipitated 32Pi (pellet) was resuspended in 100 μl of H2O, and the mixture was sonicated for 5–10 min, before adding 3.0 ml UltimaGold-XR and counted as described above. GlcNAc production was quantitated by the Morgan-Elson method. We have previously described the cloning of a periplasmic β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (ExoI) from V. furnissii (18Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33425-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the 3′ region of the cloned exoI gene indicated that it was followed by another open reading frame whose start codon was 169 base pairs after the exoI stop codon. Further analysis indicated the presence of a truncated gene sequence with homology to cellobiose phosphorylase (discussed below) designated chbP in the original clone. To clone the remaining portion of chbP, a V. furnissii cosmid library transfected into E. coli was screened by hybridization to exoI (data not shown), yielding the cosmid clone pRhexo. Portions of cosmid pRhexo were sequenced to complete the chbP nucleotide sequence (deposited in GenBankTM with the accession number AF230379). The predicted amino acid sequence of ChbP, based on the nucleotide sequence of chbP, is a protein containing 800 amino acids (89 kDa). Sequence analysis of the region (169 base pairs) betweenexoI and chbP did not reveal the presence of any ribosome-binding sites, nor was there a TATA region preceding thechbP start codon. These observations indicate that perhapsexoI and chbP are in an operon and are expressed by a polycistronic message. A search of the SWISS-PROT Data Bank identified several proteins with significant similarities to the translated open reading frame of chbP. These proteins included several cellobiose phosphorylases from different organisms, Thermotoga neapolitana (36% identity) (29Dakhova O.N. Kurepina N.E. Zverlov V.V. Svetlichnyi V.A.

J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The similarities between chbP and the cellobiose phosphorylases were spread over the entire protein sequences; apparently, the active sites of these enzymes have not been identified. The sequence determined from the cosmid clone pRhexo was used to design primers for subcloning chbP into the pET21a overexpression vector as described under “Experimental Procedures,” yielding pET:chbP. The enzyme was purified from recombinant E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pET:chbP as described under “Experimental Procedures” (TableI), yielding an apparently homogenous protein (Fig. 1 A). The enzyme was purified 7-fold from the crude extract with a 40% yield. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified recombinant protein resulted in the following sequence: Met-Lys-Tyr-Gly-Tyr-Phe-Asp-Asn-Asp-Asn, in complete agreement with the N-terminal sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence.Table IPurification of recombinant (GlcNAc)2 phosphorylaseStepTotal proteinTotal activity 1-a(GlcNAc)2phosphorolysis (nmol/min); 30 °C, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm P1.Specific activity 1-b(GlcNAc)2 phosphorolysis (nmol/μg/min).Purification factormgunitsunits/μgfold1.

Open table in a new tab (GlcNAc)2 phosphorylase activity was measured using two complementary assays, each of which measures one product of the reaction, i.e. GlcNAc-1-P or GlcNAc. GlcNAc-1-P was determined by the incorporation of 32Pi into the product, and GlcNAc was determined by the Morgan-Elson assay. A time course of GlcNAc-1-P and GlcNAc formation from a mixture of (GlcNAc)2 and 32Pi is shown in Fig.1 B. Equimolar quantities of GlcNAc and GlcNAc-1-P are formed from the disaccharide. It is important to emphasize that no GlcNAc was formed in the absence of Pi (data not shown), and therefore the enzyme is not a hydrolase or β-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Enzyme activity was determined as a function of pH, ionic strength, and temperature as described under “Experimental Procedures.”"

Type II cells weakly activate caspase-8 and must amplify their death signal through the mitochondria. These cells can be rescued by Bcl-xL. Here we show that tumor necrosis factor-α induces both Type I and II pathways, which can be inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk) and Bcl-xL in a cooperative fashion. Death induced in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk was associated with a partial inhibition of caspase-8, whereas no effects on cytochrome c release, DEVDase activity, and intranucleosomal DNA cleavage were observed. Thus, Z-VAD-fmk is likely weakening the death-inducing signaling complex-mediated activation of caspase-8 and diverting cells to a Type II pathway. Bcl-xL cooperates with Z-VAD-fmk by blocking the Type II pathway at the level of cytochrome c release. Surprisingly, although Bcl-xL was able to block cytochromec release, it was unable to block mitochondrial depolarization, suggesting that these are separate events. This suggests that mitochondria occupy two places in apoptotic signaling, as initiators of apoptosis through the release of cytochrome cas well as a target for effector caspases.

Only recently have the mechanisms of apoptosis begun to be elucidated at the signal transduction level. Apoptosis can be induced by numerous stimuli, including members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)1 superfamily (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar). The two well characterized prototypes of the TNFR superfamily that have been shown to induce apoptosis are CD95 (Fas/Apo-1) and the p55 Type 1 TNFR (TNFR1). Ligation of these receptors leads to oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of cytosolic adapter and effector proteins to the receptor complex (also termed the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC)) (2Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar). CD95 contains a stretch of amino acids on its cytoplasmic tail termed the “death domain” that binds to the adapter molecule Fas-associated death domain (FADD) protein and is essential for CD95-mediated apoptosis (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 2Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2165) Google Scholar). FADD then binds to the upstream initiator molecule procaspase-8 through death effector domains contained in each protein; and upon receptor oligomerization, adjacent procaspase-8 molecules are activated to initiate the apoptotic signaling cascade (4Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R. Mann M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M.

Type I cells induce strong activation of the DISC, leading to a mitochondria-independent pathway resulting in activation of caspase-3. Thus, Bcl-2 cannot rescue these cells from CD95-induced apoptosis. Conversely, Type II cells weakly activate their DISC and induce death through a mitochondriadependent pathway that is inhibited by Bcl-2. Parameters of mitochondrial dysfunction that have been demonstrated to occur during apoptosis include loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) (7Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C.

Some have suggested that these events are mediated by the irreversible opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), which consists of a complex of proteins that spans the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (15Zoratti M.

The role of the PTP and the ordering of these mitochondrial events in the apoptotic cascade are unclear and may be both stimulus- and cell-specific. Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family reside on the outer mitochondrial membrane and have been implicated in maintaining normal mitochondrial function (19Zamzami N. Brenner C. Marzo I.

The ability of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) to inhibit apoptosis appears to depend on both the stimulus as well as the cell tested. Bcl-2 family members can inhibit apoptosis by many mechanisms such as homo- or heterodimerization with other family members (19Zamzami N. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Kroemer G.

Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E209-E216Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). These mechanisms may explain, at least in part, why Bcl-2 is unable to block apoptotic signals that bypass the mitochondria. Although the Type I/II cell death pathways induced by CD95 have been studied in some detail, the pathways generated in response to TNF-α-induced apoptosis are not as well characterized. In some cells, TNF-α treatment alone does not lead to apoptosis due to the proliferation and survival effects of TNFR1 signaling. These signals require de novo protein synthesis. For this reason, these cells can be sensitized to TNF-α by simultaneous treatment with RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors such as actinomycin D and cycloheximide (CHX), respectively. We have previously shown that Bcl-2 cooperates with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk to inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis in a Bcl-2 cleavage-independent fashion (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that Z-VAD-fmk has no effect on cytochrome c release or caspase-3 activation, but partially inhibits caspase-8 activation. Conversely, Bcl-xL can block cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria and decrease effector caspase activity. Interestingly, neither Bcl-xL nor Z-VAD-fmk alone blocks loss of ΔΨm. Furthermore, the loss of ΔΨm is not inhibited by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the PTP (24Broekemeier K.M. Dempsey M.E. Pfeiffer D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7826-7830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Nicolli A. Basso E. Petronelli V. Wenger R.M. Bernardi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2185-2192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Based on the data we have obtained, we propose a model of TNF-α-induced apoptosis whereby both Type I and II signals are utilized. Z-VAD-fmk inhibits the Type I signal through a partial inhibition of caspase-8, and Bcl-xL blocks the Type II signal. Activation of effector caspases through either apoptotic pathway results in loss of ΔΨm in a Bcl-xL-, Z-VAD-fmk-, and PTP-independent fashion. The interleukin-3-dependent murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 was cultured and transfected as described previously (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All results shown in the figures were from experiments performed with Bcl-xL-expressing cells, but identical results were obtained using Bcl-2-expressing cells. Results shown were derived from bulk-transfected cultures, but similar results were obtained using single-cell clones. The crmAconstruct was generated by polymerase chain reaction using acrmAcDNA construct (obtained from Colin S. Duckett, National Institutes of Health) and the following primers: 5′-CCGAATTCAAGCTTCCATGGATATCTTCAGGGAAATCG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCTTAATTAGTTGTTGGAGAGCAATATCTAC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript® SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), verified by DNA sequencing, and subsequently cloned into the expression vector pSFFV-Neo (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A dominant-negative FADD molecule was generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using mRNA from a mouse pre-B cell line (A5C6 μ−) with the following primers: 5′-CCGAATTCTCAGGGTGTTTCTGAGGAAGACACAG-3′ and 5′-CCGAATTCCATGGACGACTTCGAGGCGGGGACGGCGACC-3′. All cDNA constructs were digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and subcloned into the phagemid vector pBluescript® SK(+). The sequenced insert was then cut out with EcoRI and subcloned into the expression vector pSFFV-Neo, which has been described previously (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and used for cell transfections. As a negative control, cells were transfected with the FADD-DN cDNA cloned into pSFFV-Neo in the reverse (antisense) orientation. Cell death assays were performed as described (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and percent viability was assessed by annexin V-FITC (5 μl; Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) and propidium iodide (PI; 2 μg/ml; Sigma) staining on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Western blotting was performed as described (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies against caspase-8 and caspase-3 (Dr. Anu Srinivasan, Idun Pharmaceuticals), a monoclonal antibody against pigeon cytochrome c (7H8.2C12; Pharmingen), a polyclonal antibody against mouse BID (obtained from Dr. Stanley Korsmeyer, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute), a polyclonal antibody against mouse FADD (obtained from Dr. Astar Winoto, University of California, Berkeley, CA), and a polyclonal antibody directed against the C terminus of mouse DNA fragmentation factor-45 (DFF-45)/ICAD (Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA). Where indicated, blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal antibody against actin (Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading. The following secondary antibodies were used: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse Ig and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Densitometry was performed using the NIH Image 1.6.1 program. Shorter exposures than those shown were scanned for densitometry to ensure that the values obtained were within the linear range. Cells were treated as described. After 5.5 h, 5 × 105 cells were harvested and stained for 60 min at 37 °C with 10 μm DEVD-G1D2substrate solution (Oncoimmunin, Inc., College Park, MD). Cells were then washed once with ice-cold flow cytometry dilution buffer and resuspended in 500 μl of fresh dilution buffer. Samples were analyzed on the FACScan flow cytometer using the FL1 channel. The mean fluorescence intensity of the DEVD-G1D2-positive cells was calculated relative to the mean fluorescence intensity of the DEVD-G1D2-positive Neo cells cultured in medium alone (untreated). Cells (5 × 107) were resuspended at 2.5 × 106cells/ml and treated as indicated. Cells were pelleted, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold Buffer A (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 170 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 16 μg/ml aprotinin, and 4 μg/ml leupeptin), and incubated for 10 min on ice. Cells were lysed in a Wheaton overhead stirrer: seven strokes at the 3.5 setting. Unlysed cells and nuclei were pelleted at 120 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The pellet from this spin contained the mitochondrial fraction and was resuspended in 1 ml of Buffer A. The supernatant was spun at 100,000 × gfor 1 h at 4 °C, and the supernatant from this spin contained the cytosolic S100 fraction. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). 150 μg of the mitochondrial fraction and an equal volume of the S100 fraction were loaded on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to Western blotting for cytochromec as described above. Genomic DNA was isolated as described (26Minn A.J. Rudin C.M. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Blood. 1995; 86: 1903-1910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 1 μg of DNA was run on a 1.5% agarose gel to analyze DNA fragmentation. FL5.12 cells were incubated for the last 30 min of cell death experiments with 150 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.). Cells were harvested and washed with and then resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% sodium azide) supplemented with 15 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester. Samples were analyzed on the FACScan flow cytometer. We have shown previously that overexpression of Bcl-2 in the murine pro-B cell line FL5.12 does not inhibit TNF-α-induced cell death unless caspases are also inhibited by the addition of Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm) (23Johnson B.W. Boise L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18552-18558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, similar results were obtained using Bcl-xL-transfected cells. The addition of Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm) to control (Neo) cells did rescue these cells from TNF-α-induced apoptosis. Similarly, overexpression of Bcl-xL was also insufficient to inhibit cell death. However, as previously shown for Bcl-2, the combination of Bcl-xL and Z-VAD-fmk was sufficient to inhibit TNF-α-induced cell death. One potential explanation for the cooperativity observed is that Bcl-xL and Z-VAD-fmk are inhibiting two independent death pathways initiated by TNFR1 ligation. Thus, we inhibited components of the TNFR1 DISC to determine the farthest downstream molecule common to both pathways. To this end, a dominant-negative murine FADD cDNA construct (FADD-DN, encoding amino acids 80–205) was generated and stably transfected into FL5.12 cells. FADD-DN expression was verified by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Expression of a FADD-DN protein was sufficient to block TNF-α-induced cell death, whereas Neo cells or cells transfected with a FADD-DN cDNA construct in the antisense orientation were not resistant to this stimulus (Fig.2 A). These results are consistent with several previous reports (1Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5169) Google Scholar, 2Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I.

The product of the cowpox virus cytokine response modifier A gene (CrmA) can preferentially inhibit upstream and inflammatory caspases such as caspase-8 (27Zhou Q. Snipas S. Orth K. Muzio M.

As shown in Fig. 2 B and consistent with previous findings in other cell types (4Muzio M. Chinnaiyan A.M. Kischkel F.C. O'Rourke K. Shevchenko A. Ni J. Scaffidi C. Bretz J.D. Zhang M. Gentz R.

Since CrmA but not Z-VAD-fmk alone is sufficient to block TNF-α-induced cell death, it is likely that Z-VAD-fmk cannot completely inhibit caspase-8. To test the activation of caspase-8, we prepared whole cell lysates after TNF-α treatment and performed Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-caspase-8 antibody. Consistent with the decrease in viability that was observed, the procaspase-8 band (∼55 kDa) was processed in the presence of TNF-α and CHX in both Neo and Bcl-xL cells (Fig. 2 C). However, the addition of 50 μm Z-VAD-fmk to either Neo or Bcl-xL cells had a partial effect on caspase-8 processing (Fig. 2 C). CHX had no effect on either the viability of the cells or the intensity of the procaspase-8 band (Fig. 2 C), suggesting that the disappearance of the 55-kDa proenzyme band was a result of TNF-α signaling and not a lack of de novoprotein synthesis. Taken together, these results suggest that if multiple pathways generated by TNF-α treatment are present, they diverge at the level of caspase-8 activation. These data are consistent with the loss of death receptor signaling in FADD- and caspase-8-deficient cells (28Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A.

An early event triggered by death receptor signaling is caspase-8-mediated cleavage of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member BID (31Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 32Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.-J. Yuan J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). After cleavage, BID translocates to the mitochondria and induces cytochrome c release, ultimately resulting in the activation of effector caspases. We therefore tested the ability of Z-VAD-fmk and/or Bcl-xL to inhibit caspase-8 activity at the level of BID cleavage. As shown in Fig. 2 D, treatment of Neo cells with TNF-α and CHX resulted in the appearance of 15-kDa (p15), 13-kDa (p13), and 11-kDa (p11) cleavage fragments of BID. Densitometry indicated that only 20–30% (range from three experiments, normalized to actin) of the full-length p22 BID was present in both Neo and Bcl-xL cells treated with TNF-α/CHX compared with untreated cells. Densitometry also indicated that 50–60% of p22 BID was present in both Neo and Bcl-xLcells treated with TNF-α/CHX/Z-VAD-fmk compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2 D). Thus, consistent with a partial inhibition of caspase-8, Z-VAD-fmk could partially inhibit cleavage of BID. Conversely, overexpression of Bcl-xL did not inhibit p22 BID cleavage, suggesting that BID cleavage is upstream of Bcl-xL. The difference in the pattern of BID cleavage products in the presence of Bcl-xL is consistent with previous observations (33Gross A. Yin X.-M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). Although only low levels of BID cleavage fragments were detected in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells treated with Z-VAD-fmk, densitometry demonstrated that the p22 BID band was only 50–60% of untreated levels, suggesting that cleavage had indeed occurred. Again, this change was not induced by treatment of cells with CHX alone (Fig. 2 D). We propose that in cells in which apoptosis is blocked, the BID cleavage fragments are unstable and are rapidly degraded. Cell death that occurs in the presence of caspase inhibitors can exhibit a necrotic, not apoptotic, phenotype (34Vercammen D. Brouckaert G. Denecker G. Van de Craen M. Declercq W. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 919-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TNF-α-induced cell death observed in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk displays hallmarks of caspase activity, we analyzed the effects of Z-VAD-fmk on caspase-dependent events during TNF-α-induced cell death. One of the hallmarks of apoptosis is the fragmentation of genomic DNA into intranucleosomal fragments. Intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation is achieved through the activity of DFF-4"

Here we present evidence suggesting a role for the host phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases during T. cruziinvasion. The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin marked inhibitedT. cruzi infection when macrophages were pretreated for 20 min at 37 °C before inoculation. Infection of macrophages withT. cruzi markedly stimulated the formation of the lipid products of the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinases, PI 3-phospate , PI 3,4-biphosphate, and PI 3,4,5-triphosphate, but not PI 4-phosphate or PI 4,5-biphosphate. This activation was inhibited by wortmannin. Infection with T. cruzi also stimulated a marked increase in the in vitro lipid kinase activities that are present in the immunoprecipitates of anti-p85 subunit of class I PI 3-kinase and anti-phosphotyrosine. In addition, T. cruzi invasion also activated lipid kinase activity found in immunoprecipitates of class II and class III PI 3-kinases. These data demonstrate thatT. cruzi invasion into macrophages strongly activates separated PI 3-kinase isoforms. Furthermore, the inhibition of the class I and class III PI 3-kinase activities abolishes the parasite entry into macrophages.

This parasite is now viewed as an emerging human pathogen of HIV-1-infected individuals as it can be transmitted through blood transfusions (2National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Council News. 1996; 5: 1-16Google Scholar). This unicellular parasite presents three developmental stages; epimastigote and amastigote forms correspond to proliferative stages found in the invertebrate and vertebrate hosts, respectively. The trypomastigote forms are infective and invade different host cell types, first macrophages, in order to replicate (3Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev.

However, some evidence suggests that T. cruzi interacts with different signaling systems of the host. It has been shown that the transforming growth factor β-receptor signaling pathway is essential for T. cruzi invasion (4Ming M. Ewen M.E. Pereira M.E.

Invasion of T. cruzi into cells also appears to trigger an unusual mechanism, which involves recruitment and fusion of host lysosomes at the invasion site (3Burleigh B.A. Andrews N.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1995; 49: 175-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), suggesting that this parasite is able to interact with host signaling systems that regulate membrane trafficking.Several forms of evidence now indicate that phosphorylation of the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides, catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol (PI)13-kinases, is a critical step in many cellular processes, such as cytoskeletal rearrangement, membrane trafficking, and endosome fusion (9Toker A.

The binding of p85 to these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins activates the associated p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of PI 4,5-P2 to PI 3,4,5-P3. The class II PI 3-kinases represent a novel group of PI 3-kinases containing a C2 domain at their C terminus, and three mammalian isoforms, namely PI 3-kinase C2α, PI 3-kinase C2β, and PI 3-kinase C2γ, have been cloned (11Virbasius J.V.

However, the effect of T. cruziinvasion on the host lipid kinases has not been studied. In the present studies, we address the question of whether T. cruziinfection may activate host cell PI 3-kinases and if efficient infection requires the host PI 3-kinase activity. Here we show thatT. cruzi infection causes marked increases in cellular amounts of PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3, as well as host PI 3-kinase activation. Moreover, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin strongly blocked T. cruzi infection. These results suggest an important role for host PI 3-kinases in theT. cruzi infection process.

The binding of p85 to these tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins activates the associated p110 catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of PI 4,5-P2 to PI 3,4,5-P3. The class II PI 3-kinases represent a novel group of PI 3-kinases containing a C2 domain at their C terminus, and three mammalian isoforms, namely PI 3-kinase C2α, PI 3-kinase C2β, and PI 3-kinase C2γ, have been cloned (11Virbasius J.V.

These PI 3-kinases prefer to phosphorylate PI and PI 4-P as substrates in vitro, but not PI 4,5-P2. The role of class II PI 3-kinases in the cells and their regulations are not understood, although some recent reports show activation of class II PI 3-kinases by chemokine MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein) in monocytes (14Turner S.J.

Class III enzymes are homologous to the archetypal Vps34p characterized inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which only produce PI 3-P (17Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D.

Some of the downstream elements that mediate the action of lipid products of PI 3-kinases appear to include: 1) serine/threonine kinases PKB and PDK-1 (9Toker A. Cantley L.C.

In the present studies, we address the question of whether T. cruziinfection may activate host cell PI 3-kinases and if efficient infection requires the host PI 3-kinase activity. Here we show thatT. cruzi infection causes marked increases in cellular amounts of PI 3-P, PI 3,4-P2, and PI 3,4,5-P3, as well as host PI 3-kinase activation. Moreover, the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin strongly blocked T. cruzi infection. These results suggest an important role for host PI 3-kinases in theT. cruzi infection process.

https://openalex.org/W1989557938,"A novel protein was cloned from a rat liver cDNA library by interaction with the liver glucokinase. This protein contained 339 residues and possessed a canonical consensus sequence for a dual specificity phosphatase. The recombinant protein was able to dephosphorylate phosphotyrosyl and phosphoseryl/threonyl substrates. We called this protein the glucokinase-associated phosphatase (GKAP). The GKAP partially dephosphorylated the recombinant glucokinase previously phosphorylated,in vitro, by protein kinase A. The GKAP fused with green fluorescent protein was located in the cytosol, where glucokinase phosphorylates glucose, and not in the nucleus where the glucokinase is retained inactive by the glucokinase regulatory protein. More importantly, the GKAP accelerated the glucokinase activity in a dose-dependent manner and with a stoichiometry compatible with a physiological mechanism. This strongly suggested that the interaction between GKAP and glucokinase had a functional significance. The cloning of this novel protein with a dual specificity phosphatase activity allows the description of a possible new regulatory step in controlling the glycolysis flux.

In that respect, the regulation of glucokinase activity is involved in glucose homeostasis. The glucokinase belongs to the hexokinase family of proteins (1Magnuson M.A. Andreone T.L. Printz R.L. Koch S. Granner D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4838-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The hexokinases activities are known to be regulated by interactions with proteins. These proteins locate hexokinases in the proper cell compartment, creating a metabolic microcompartmentation, as reported for hexokinase I. The hexokinase I is bound to porin at the outer mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme has thus a direct access to the source of ATP generated within the mitochondria (2Adams V. Griffins L. Towbin J. Gelb B. Workley K. McCabe E.R.B. Biochem. Med. Metabol. Biol. 1991; 45: 271-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In this way, the enzyme activity is greatly improved (3Aora K.K. Fanciulli M. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6481-6488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the nucleus, glucokinase is anchored to the glucokinase regulatory protein (4VanSchaftingen E. Detheux M. Da Cunha M.V. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 414-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the glucokinase (hexokinase IV) can be found either in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm of liver cells. The translocation of glucokinase from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the glycolysis takes place, depends upon its substrate concentrations in the extracellular medium (5Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 6Agius L. Peak M. Van Schaftingen E. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 711-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Brown K.S.

Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Glucokinase is found predominantly into the nucleus of hepatocytes from starved rats, and after 1 and 2 h of refeeding, glucokinase is translocated into the cytosol (8Fernandez-Novell J.M. Castel S. Bellido D. Ferrer J.C. Vilaro S. Guinovart J.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The role of the glucokinase regulatory protein is thus to sequester the enzyme in a compartment where it might be inactive (5Van Schaftingen E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 9Farrelly D. Brown K.S. Tieman A. Ren J. Lira S.A. Hagan D. Gregg R. Mookhtiar K.A. Hariharan N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14511-14516Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, at the present time, it is not known if a protein is able to retain glucokinase in the cytoplasm either at the plasma membrane or at the mitochondria, close to the glucose or ATP sources. Moreover, post-translational protein modifications might also alter the activity of glucokinase. The aim of this study was to identify proteins expressed in the liver implicated in the regulation of glucokinase activity after interaction with glucokinase. We performed a two-hybrid screen using rat liver glucokinase as a bait, and showed that glucokinase was interacting not only with the glucokinase regulatory protein, but also with a newly identified dual specificity phosphatase called GKAP.1 The function of this interaction was analyzed. All manipulations were carried out by standard techniques and plasmid structures verified by DNA sequencing. The entire coding sequence of rat hepatic glucokinase was recovered (BamHI/AvrII fragment) from a plasmid (10Liang Y. Jetton T.L. Zimmerman E.C. Najafi H. Matschinsky F.M. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6999-7007Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted in frame at the BamHI site of the yeast expression vector pLex9 (pLex-GK) and of the bacterial expression vector pQE-32 (pQE-32-GK). pBSKS-GKRP contains the cDNA of glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP) (a gift from E. Van Schaftingen). Then, GKRP was subcloned in frame into pLex9. Hexokinase II was similarly constructed in pLex9, in fusion with the yeast LexA DNA binding domain (pLex-HKII). The cDNA encoding GKAP was excised (EcoRI/XbaI fragment) from the pGAD plasmid of the two-hybrid screen and subcloned into pBSSK to produce pBSSK-GKAP. An EcoRI/NotI fragment containing the GKAP insert was then isolated from pBSSK-GKAP and inserted into pGEX-4T2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in frame with GST coding sequence (pGEX-4T2- GKAP) and into an pEGFPc vector (CLONTECH), in frame with green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-GKAP). A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed as described previously (11Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Auzan C. Clauser E. Van Obberghen E. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Girard J. Burnol A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26026-26035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), using the entire coding sequence of glucokinase as the bait. The rat liver cDNA library was constructed in pGAD3S2X plasmid. The positive plasmids were tested for specificity using pLex-HKII. Then, their cDNA inserts were sequenced using an Applied Biosystems sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The BLAST program was used to search for sequence homology in the GenBank data base. Recombinant GKAP was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, using the plasmid pGEX-4T2-GKAP to transform Escherichia coli BL21. These cells were grown in LB medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.7. The inducer isopropyl-1-thio-d-β-galactopyranoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the cultures were shaken at 30 °C for 2 h 30 min. Cell extract, purification and elution were performed as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For bacterial expression of glucokinase, pQE-32-GK plasmid was used to produce a N-terminal His-tagged fusion protein. Expression of His-GK was induced by incubating transformed E. coli with 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-d-β-galactopyranoside at 22 °C for 22 h. The protein was affinity purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose under native conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen) and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The specific activity of recombinant glucokinase was 5 units/mg of protein as measured by the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase-coupled assay (described below). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using BSA as a standard and the integrity of the fusion proteins were verified by SDS-PAGE. Bacterially expressed His-tagged GK (2 μg) was incubated with 10 units of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A (Sigma) for 1 or 2 h at 30 °C in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 μm ATP, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The reaction was stopped by the addition of 25 μl of 10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 8.0, and the phosphorylated glucokinase was affinity-purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen). Bound protein was eluted with 30 μl of 250 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Hydrolysis of pNPP by GKAP was carried out in a reaction volume of 800 μl containing 50 mmimidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mmpNPP at 37 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 200 μl of 1 m NaOH and the absorbance at 405 nm was measured. For peptide assays, raytide was labeled at its tyrosine residues using [γ - 32P]ATP and c-Src tyrosine kinase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Oncogene Science), except that the reaction was incubated for 14–16 h. Phosphorylation of kemptide (Sigma) at its serine residues was conducted in a manner similar to that employed for His-GK. The radiolabeled peptides were separated from free [γ - 32P]ATP using 1 × 1-cm P-81 sheets of phosphocellulose paper essentially as described in Ref.12Zhou G. Denu J.M. Wu L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28084-28090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Dephosphorylation with GST-GKAP was performed for the indicated time at 30 °C in 50 μl of assay mixture containing 50 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, purified enzyme, and phosphorylated peptide (2–5 × 105 cpm). The reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.75 ml of acidic charcoal mixture (0.9 m HCl, 90 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm NaH2PO4, 4% (v/v) Norit A). The radiolabeled substrates bound to the charcoal were removed by centrifugation, and released phosphate was measured by scintillation counting of the supernatant. The ability of GKAP to dephosphorylate glucokinase was tested by incubating 10 μl of His-GK elution (see above) with GST-GKAP in the presence of 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C for 10 min, stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The dephosphorylation study was performed using GST-GKAP purified from bacteria, GKAP, and GKRP generated using an in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega). 10 μl of the translation mix was then used for the phosphatase assay. Total RNA was purified from rat tissues using the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (13Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (11Kasus-Jacobi A. Perdereau D. Auzan C. Clauser E. Van Obberghen E. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Girard J. Burnol A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26026-26035Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) using as probe the full-length GKAP cDNA. The presence of GKAP in βversus other pancreatic cells was assessed by RT-PCR analysis. The rat pancreatic islets were isolated after collagenase digestion of the pancreas, and resuspended in PBS-EGTA supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml trypsin. The β cells were sorted by the autofluorescence for FAD and the light scatter parameter (cell size) using a FACStar plus (Becton Dickinson) with an argon laser (163, Spectra Physics) at 488 nm. The quality of the sorting was verified by subsequent FACS analysis of samples of the purified cells. RNA from β cells were about 40–50-fold enriched in specific mRNA when compared with RNA from total pancreas (data not shown). Reverse transcription was performed using 5 μg of RNA from the sorted β cells (and white adipose tissue) using a random primer, and then PCR was achieved using two oligonucleotides: ccgtacttaccacaggg and gtttgtgatcccagcgc, specific for GKAP leading to a band of 250 bp. The mhAT3F hepatoma cell line was derived from transgenic mice synthesizing the SV40 large T and small t antigens under the control of antithrombin III promoter (14Antoine B. Levrat F. Vallet V. Berbar T. Cartier N. Kahn A. Exp. Cell Res. 1992; 200: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on glass four-chamber slides (Falcon, CultureSlides) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F12, Glutamax (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, 0.1 μm insulin, 1 μm dexamethasone, 1 μm triiodothyronine, and 5% fetal calf serum. mhAT3F cells were plated and transfected by using the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitation method (15Chen C. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with pEGFP and pEGFP-GKAP vectors. After 2 days, cells were washed three times with PBS, fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and quenched for 10 min in 50 mm NH4Cl. The nuclei were stained in bright blue using Hoechst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml) for 5 min. After extensive washes in PBS the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst). The fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus IMT2 inverted microscope, fluorescence immersion lens (40×) and fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. Photographs (Kodak Panther P1600 film) were taken with an Olympus MO-4Ti camera adapted to the microscope. The glucokinase activity was determined by following the accumulation of NADH at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer. The glucokinase phosphorylates glucose into glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P), this substrate is transformed into 6-phosphogluconate and NADH by the G-6-P dehydrogenase (fromLeuconostoc mesenteriode). This last reaction depends directly on the glucokinase activity. The glucokinase activity was measured in the presence of 0.1 m glucose, 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm NAD, 2 units of G-6-P dehydrogenase, and 1 or 2 μg of recombinant GK, during 15 min at 30 °C. The base line was recorded for 2 min, and then the reaction was initialized by the addition of ATP-Mg2+ (5 mm). The glucose phosphorylating activity was also tested without recombinant glucokinase, without glucose, without ATP, or with 1 mmglucose or GKAP only. In these conditions, no activity was detected. 10 μl of recombinant glucokinase was phosphorylated directly after elution from nickel beads by incubation during 30 min at 30 °C in 90 μl of medium containing protein kinase A buffer (1× Biolabs), 8 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 200 μmATP-Mg2+, 50 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, and in absence or presence of 25 units of the protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Biolabs). We verified by autoradiography that the recombinant glucokinase was phosphorylated by protein kinase A in presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Then, the glucokinase activity was measured on 100 μl of the phosphorylation reaction. The GKAP effect on glucokinase activity was recorded after the addition of various amounts of the fusion protein 10 min after the beginning of the reaction. The results were expressed as enzymatic units per milligram of protein. To identify novel proteins that interact with hepatic glucokinase, we have used the two-hybrid system (16Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). A fusion between the LexA DNA-binding domain and the full-length glucokinase was used as a bait to screen a library of rat liver cDNA fused with the Gal4 activation domain. Approximately 5 × 106 yeast transformants were tested, and 70 clones were classified as positive, since they interacted strongly with glucokinase and not with an unrelated protein such as lamin. Restriction mapping and sequence analysis revealed five different groups of positive clones. One of these groups corresponded to the glucokinase regulatory protein, whose specific interaction with glucokinase is known. Another group contains the cDNA of an unknown protein, which was studied here. The deduced amino acid sequence of this new protein possesses the canonical motif, HCXXGXXR(S/T), common to all protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (see below), suggesting that it may be a novel protein phosphatase. We called it GKAP (glucokinase-associatedphosphatase). GKAP cDNA extends 1314 bp with a possible translation start site (17Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 229-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (2810) Google Scholar) at bp 19, followed by a 1017-bp coding region (Fig. 1). Searches of missing sequence upstream of this initiating methionine, using the 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique (CLONTECH), failed to recover a longer fragment than the insert of cDNA isolated during the yeast two-hybrid screen. Thus, we have considered the position 19–21 bp as the first ATG codon. The GKAP was shown to interact specifically with glucokinase but not with another isoform of mammalian hexokinase family, hexokinase II (Table I).Table ISpecificity of GKAP interaction with GK in the double-hybrid systempLEX-GKpLEX-HKIIpLEX-RafpGAD-GKRP+++−−pGAD-GKAP+++−−pGAD-Lam−−−pGAD-Ras−−+++The GKAP was not able to interact with another isoform of hexokinase, hexokinase II in yeast.

The number of + indicated the intensity of the blue coloration obtained after β-galactosidase filter assay and compared with a positive control (Ras/Raf interaction: +++) on the same filter. The absence of blue coloration was indicated by −, comparable to the negative control (Lamin/Raf: −) on the same filter. These cotransfections of yeast were reproduced independently two times. Open table in a new tab The GKAP was not able to interact with another isoform of hexokinase, hexokinase II in yeast. The known interaction between glucokinase and glucokinase regulatory protein was observed. The number of + indicated the intensity of the blue coloration obtained after β-galactosidase filter assay and compared with a positive control (Ras/Raf interaction: +++) on the same filter. The absence of blue coloration was indicated by −, comparable to the negative control (Lamin/Raf: −) on the same filter. These cotransfections of yeast were reproduced independently two times. The GKAP amino acid sequence predicted a polypeptide of 339 residues with an estimated molecular mass of 37 kDa. Comparison of this sequence with the GenBank data base revealed that GKAP is related to members of a dual specificity protein-tyrosine phosphatases (dsPTP) family, which hydrolyze phosphate from Ser/Thr as well as Tyr residues. Throughout its entire length, GKAP protein exhibits the greatest similarity to the yeast dsPTP yVH1. The two proteins are 28% identical (42% similar), the greater homology being within C-terminal regions, and both of them contain the PTP domain at the N-terminal half (Fig.2 A). With regard to mammalian members of dsPTP whose PTP signature motif is located on the C-terminal portion, GKAP also shows significant identity to hVH3 (35%), rVH6 (33%), CL100 (30%), rVH2 (29%), and PAC1 (27%), over a stretch of 141 residues throughout the active site consensus sequence. The alignment of these regions between GKAP and these other family members is illustrated in Fig. 2 B. We have examined the expression pattern of GKAP in various rat tissues by Northern blot analysis (Fig.3). A single 2.2-kilobase pair transcript was observed in all the tissues tested. Relatively higher levels of expression were seen in lung, brain, and pancreas, whereas moderate levels were found in heart, liver, intestine, skeletal muscle, and brown adipose tissue. Lower levels of GKAP mRNA were also detected in kidney and white adipose tissue. Among pancreatic cells, we verified by RT-PCR analysis that GKAP was present in β cells, pancreatic cells that express glucokinase (Fig. 3). Hepatoma cells, mhAT3F, were transiently tranfected with pEGFP-GKAP. The subcellular location of the fusion proteins was studied using the green fluorescence of GFP (Fig. 4). The nuclei are visualized by bright blue fluorescence (Fig. 4). The GFP is distributed uniformly in mhAT3F cells, whereas the GFP-GKAP is shown to be located in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. A specific subcellular location is thus observed for the GFP-GKAP fusion protein. To investigate whether GKAP encodes an active phosphatase, recombinant GKAP was expressed, purified, and assayed for enzymatic activity. As shown in Fig.5 A, the fusion protein GST-GKAP hydrolyzed the artificial substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP). Hydrolysis increased linearly as a function of GKAP concentration, and this catalytic activity was effectively abolished by sodium orthovanadate, an inhibitor of the protein-tyrosine phosphatases. We then tested the ability of GKAP to dephosphorylate two peptide substrates, raytide and kemptide, which contain respectively phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine. Results with raytide were similar to those with pNPP. Purified GST-GKAP hydrolyzed the phosphate monoester from raytide and this dephosphorylation was blocked by sodium orthovanadate (Fig. 5 B). However, under similar conditions, we could not detect phosphatase activity using phosphoseryl kemptide as substrate (data not shown). This could be an index of a substrate selectivity of GKAP. It remains possible that in vivo GKAP dephosphorylates phosphoserine/threonine residues within its natural substrates. Since we have observed an association of glucokinase with GKAP, we explored the possibility that glucokinase might be the physiological substrate of GKAP. Glucokinase was first phosphorylated by protein kinase A (Fig. 6 A), using the purified glucokinase expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged fusion protein (Fig. 6 B). Then, labeled glucokinase was incubated with GST-GKAP. Recombinant GST-GKAP (Fig. 6 D) dephosphorylated glucokinase in a concentration-dependent manner, as shown in Fig. 6C (lanes 1–4). The dephosphorylation of labeled glucokinase by GST-GKAP was not complete even when the GST-GKAP treatment was greater than 2 h (data not shown). Moreover, neither E. coli lysate (data not shown) nor GST alone purified in the same conditions as GST-GKAP (Fig.6 C, lane 5) were able to dephosphorylate glucokinase. Thus, proteins copurified with GST-GKAP are unlikely to be responsible for the glucokinase dephosphorylation observed. To further assess the specificity of the reaction, the GKAP was produced by using an in vitro transcription/translation system (Fig. 6 F). This GKAP generated an identical dephosphorylation of glucokinase (Fig. 6 E, lane 2). The glucokinase regulatory protein, produced by reticulocyte lysate (Fig. 6 F, lane 3), was unable to dephosphorylate glucokinase (Fig. 6 E,lane 4). This eliminated the possible dephosphorylating activity of proteins present in the reticulocyte lysate. Taken together these experiments suggest that glucokinase dephosphorylation was due to GKAP. We also showed that the dephosphorylating activity was sensitive to inhibition by a phosphatase inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate (2 mm) (Fig. 6 E,lane 1). We further investigated the role of GKAP by studying its effect on the glucokinase activity. The basal recombinant glucokinase activity was about 1–4 units/mg of protein, in our experimental conditions, as described under “Materials and Methods.” No hexokinase or glucokinase activity could be detected in GST-GKAP or in GST preparations (data not shown). Adding GST-GKAP (6 μg) to the active glucokinase led to a 2-fold augmented production of NADH quantified by recording the optical density at 340 nm (Fig. 7 A). This was not observed when GST alone was added. A second addition of 6 μg of GST-GKAP similarly induced an increase in GK activity (Fig.7 A). The 2.5 stimulatory effect of GKAP on GK activity was dependent on the quantity of GKAP added and it was saturated over 20 μg of added GKAP (Fig. 7 B). The glucokinase activity was significantly decreased by 31 ± 9% (n = 5) when glucokinase was previously phosphorylated by protein kinase A (Fig.7 C). The addition of 3 μg of GKAP on phosphorylated GK induced a 73 ± 26% (n = 8) stimulation of its activity, whereas a similar amount of GKAP (3 μg) increased only by 50 ± 19% the unphosphorylated glucokinase activity. The association between glucokinase and a new protein (GKAP) was observed by using the two-hybrid system. GKAP mRNA was detected in all the rat tissues tested. Although these results does not correlate with the limited distribution pattern of glucokinase, GKAP mRNA appears in all tissues expressing glucokinase, suggesting that GKAP may have a specific role in these tissues. Furthermore, GKAP specifically interacts with GK and not with the closely related protein HKII. Because a dual specificity phosphatase consensus sequence was revealed after computer analysis of the cloned sequence, the function of this new protein was studied. It has been shown that purified glucokinase from rat liver is phosphorylated by PKA on serine residue(s) and that the phosphorylation reduced (50%) the enzyme activity (18Ekman P. Nilsson E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In our hands, recombinant glucokinase activity was also diminished by PKA phosphorylation. The yeast hexokinase HK2, the isoform homologous to glucokinase, has two phosphorylation sites. The serine 15, belonging to a protein kinase A consensus phosphorylation sequence, is phosphorylated after a shift to a medium with low glucose concentration (19Kriegel T.M. Rush J. Vojtek A.B. Clifton D. Fraenkel D.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation would affect the oligomeric state of HK2 (20Behlke J. Heidrich K. Naumann M. Muller E.C. Otto A. Reuter R. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11989-11995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and is essential for glucose signaling (21Randez-Gil F. Sanz P. Entian K.D. Prieto J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On serine 158, a transitory phosphorylation might occur during the transfer of γ-phosphate from ATP to glucose (22Heidrich K. Otto A. Behlke J. Rush J. Wenzel K.W. Kriegel T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1960-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In human β cell glucokinase, serine 151 corresponding to serine 158 of yeast hexokinase 2 is also phosphorylated, as a product of ATP hydrolysis (23Xu L.Z. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9939-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, a phosphorylated-dephosphorylated state of glucokinase is observed. Nevertheless, the identity of the amino acid residues bearing the phosphate, transitorily or not, is still an open question (23Xu L.Z. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Pilkis S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9939-9946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 24Fang T.Y. Alechina O. Aleshin A.E. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). GKAP is related to a subclass of PTPs commonly referred to as dsPTP (reviewed in Ref. 26Martell K.J. Angelotti T. Ullrich A. Mol. Cells. 1998; 8: 2-11PubMed Google Scholar), hydrolyzing phosphate from Ser/Thr and Tyr residues. Importantly, all of the amino acids previously shown to participate in the catalytic mechanism underlying dual specificity phosphatase activity are conserved in GKAP, including Cys-114, the catalytic cysteine that functions as the active site nucleophile, and Asp-83 and Ser-121, both involved in hydrolysis of the thiol phosphate intermediate (27Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5910-5914Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 28Denu J.M. Zhou G. Guo Y. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This protein has a long C-terminal amino acid domain of unknown function. By comparison, the recently cloned MKP-5 dual specificity phosphatase for p38 possesses a long N-terminal domain of unknown function (29Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), suggesting that the position of the catalytic domain is not the signature for this family of proteins. We confirmed experimentally that the recombinant protein is indeed a phosphatase because it dephosphorylated a model substrate pNPP and the phosphotyrosine raytide and its activity is blocked by phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate. Since glucokinase is interacting with GKAP and, generally a phosphatase is associated to its own substrate, glucokinase might be the phosphosubstrate for this phosphatase. Indeed, the recombinant glucokinase, phosphorylated by PKA (on serine residues, according to Ref. 18Ekman P. Nilsson E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 261: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), was dephosphorylated by GKAP produced by two techniques. However, the dephosphorylation was not complete presumably because the in vitro phosphorylation of glucokinase by protein kinase A occurred also on residues outside the specific motif recognized by GKAP. Similarly, it was reported that MKP dephosphorylates only partially the activated MAPK (30Mourey R.J. Vega Q.C. Campbell J.S. Wenderoth M.P. Hauschka S.D. Krebs E.G. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3795-3802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 31Zheng C.F. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16116-16119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results supported the notion that GKAP is a dual (phosphoserine/threonine and phosphotyrosine) phosphatase and may be a glucokinase-specific phosphatase. GKAP is located in the cytoplasm and not in the nucleus. This is the cell compartment where the glucokinase is catalytically active and where glycolysis occurs. Thus, it can be hypothesized that the interaction between glucokinase and GKAP regulates glucokinase activity. We showed that GKAP stimulated glucokinase activity in a dose-dependent manner. This effect occurred at a stoichiometry of GK/GKAP of 1/3 to 1/5, compatible with a physiological phenomenon. The glucokinase activity, diminished by a previous phosphorylation of the recombinant protein by PKA, was augmented by the presence of the phosphatase GKAP to a higher extent than that obtained with unphosphorylated glucokinase. The mechanism by which glucokinase activity is stimulated by GKAP remains unknown. The dephosphorylation of the glucokinase might help the phosphotransfer, as suggested in the yeast hexokinase where a transitory phosphorylated state exists as the result of the phosphotransferase activity of the enzyme (21Randez-Gil F. Sanz P. Entian K.D. Prieto J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2940-2948Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of glucokinase by GKAP could be implicated in the proteolysis of glucokinase. Indeed, it has recently been reported that mice bearing an inactivated glucokinase regulatory protein gene exhibit decreased levels of liver glucokinase. Since similar amounts of glucokinase are produced by control and knockout mice, the retention of glucokinase in the nucleus by its interaction with GKRP might protect it from degradation in the cytosol (9Farrelly D. Brown K.S. Tieman A. Ren J. Lira S.A. Hagan D. Gregg R. Mookhtiar K.A. Hariharan N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14511-14516Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In conclusion, by interaction with glucokinase, we cloned a novel dual specificity phosphatase (GKAP), which is located into the cytoplasm. We described a regulatory mechanism that accelerates the glucose phosphorylation. This new step might control the glycolysis rate, and as a consequence, the glucose uptake by the liver and the insulin secretion by pancreatic β cell. We thank D. Perdereau for DNA sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W2043346849,"We have previously reported that wild type strains of Escherichia coli grow on the chitin disaccharideN,N′-diacetylchitobiose, (GlcNAc)2, as the sole source of carbon (Keyhani, N.

An E. colitransposon mutant was selected that was unable to grow on (GlcNAc)2 but behaved normally on GlcNAc, and the mutant was used to clone the (GlcNAc)2 catabolic operon. Sequence analysis of the genes in the operon compared with the sequence of the complete E. coli genome (7Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S.

In earlier work (10Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33409-33413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), a (GlcNAc)2 permease was described in the Gram-negative, chitinolytic marine bacterium Vibrio furnissii. For these experiments, we employed a nonhydrolyzable (GlcNAc)2 analogue, methyl β-N,N′-[3H]diacetylthiochitobiose ([3H]Me-TCB). In V. furnissii, the transport product was characterized as unmodified [3H]Me-TCB, and its apparent K m for uptake was <1 μm. In the present studies, we show that transport of (GlcNAc)2/[3H]Me-TCB in E. coli is mediated via the phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS), with the sugar accumulated as its phosphorylated derivative. The phosphoryl group is linked to the C-6 position of the nonreducing GlcNAc. In E. coli, the apparent K m for [3H]Me-TCB uptake is 50–100 μm. Thus, the chitin disaccharide, (GlcNAc)2, is transported by different mechanisms in these two closely related organisms. This is in sharp contrast to other sugars, as discussed below. Reagents for bacterial media were obtained from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI), J. T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ), and BBL Microbiology Systems (Cockeysville, MD).

PTS proteins, such as homogeneous Enzyme I, HPr, and IIAGlc, were kind gifts from Drs. Norman Meadow, Regina Savtchenko, and Roshan Mattoo. E. coli strain XL1-Blue MR (D(mcrA)183 Δ(mcrCB-hsdSMR-mrr)173endA1 supE44 thi-1 recA1gyrA96 relA1 lac c) was purchased from Stratagene. E. coli strains were grown at 37 °C in LB or on Luria Agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and/or tetracycline (15 μg/ml) where appropriate for selection of recombinant E. coli cells. Alternately, cells were grown on minimal media (M9 salt) supplemented with 0.5 mm thiamine, 0.01% casamino acids, a carbon source, typically 0.25% lactate (lactate-minimal media) and further supplemented as indicated. Fermentation was assayed by using Difco MacConkey Agar Base supplemented with the indicated carbon source, typically at a concentration of 10 mm. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 15–20 h before individual colonies were scored as positive (red) or negative (white). E. coli was grown overnight in LB and diluted 50-fold in lactate-M9 salts minimal media supplemented with 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2(for induction) or as indicated. Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8–1.2, washed three times at 4 °C with equal volumes of M9 salt medium, and finally resuspended in M9 salt using 125 to 150 the volume of the growth medium. The suspension was stored on ice and maintained at room temperature for 15 min prior to use. Transport experiments were conducted no later than 2 h after harvesting and washing of the cells. Uptake was initiated by adding an equal volume of cell suspension to [3H]Me-TCB or other substrate (1–5,000 cpm/nmol) dissolved in M9 salts and aerated by shaking (150 rpm, 37 °C). Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken at the indicated times, rapidly mixed with 10 ml of wash buffer (M9 salts) at room temperature and filtered through Whatman GF/F glass microfiber filters. After washing with an additional 10 ml of buffer, the cells on the filter were solubilized with Packard Soluene-350 and counted in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. Although aliquots from a given cell suspension gave excellent replicate values for uptake, the cell preparations varied from day to day, as much as 6-fold with respect to nmol [3H]Me-TCB taken up per mg protein per min. Conceivably this variability resulted from different rates of catabolism of the inducer, (GlcNAc)2, from one cell culture to another. Transport experiments were performed as described above with the following modifications. At each time point, the glass microfiber filters, containing the harvested, washed cells, were immediately removed from the filtration apparatus and immersed in 2.0 ml of 70% EtOH and boiled for 3 min. The resulting cell extract was centrifuged (15,000 ×g, 10 min) to remove cell and filter debris, and the quantity of sugar phosphate determined by anion exchange chromatography (12Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples (0.5 ml) were transferred to columns containing Dowex-1 AG-X8 resin (1 ml), chloride form, the columns were washed thrice with 1 ml of water each, and sugar phosphate was eluted with 0.6-ml aliquots (three times) of 1.0 m NaCl. Typically, both the flow through/wash fractions and the salt eluate were collected in scintillation vials containing 3.0 ml of HIONIC fluor (Packard), and the samples were counted using a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. E. coli was grown overnight in LB and diluted 50-fold in lactate-M9 salts media supplemented with 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2 (for induction) or as indicated. Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration to an A 600 = 0.8–1.0, washed three times at 4 °C with equal volumes of toluenization buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.5% NaCl), and resuspended using 1.0 ml of toluenization buffer/0.2 gm of cells (wet weight). Toluenization was performed as described (13Bassler B.L., Yu, C. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24276-24286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, toluene (10 μl of 10% toluene solution in 95% EtOH/1.0 ml cells) was added to a borosilicate glass tube containing the cell suspension and swirled rapidly for 1 min. The tube was maintained at room temperature for 20 min, after which the cell suspension was placed on ice. The cells were used within 30 min of toluenization. Each reaction mixture (50 μl) contained phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or ATP (10 mm), 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm of the indicated radioactive substrate (specific activity, 103 cpm/nmol) The reactions were initiated by adding 3–5 ml (10–20 mg protein) of the cell suspension and terminated by placing tubes in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The quantity of sugar phosphate was determined by anion exchange chromatography (12Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The PTS was reconstituted in vitro with purified components: Enzyme I, HPr, IIAChband IIBChb (see accompanying paper (1Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), and high speed membrane fractions derived from the indicated strains. Membranes were prepared as follows. E. coli was grown overnight in LB and diluted 50-fold in lactate-M9 salts media supplemented with 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2 (induced) or as indicated. Cells were grown at 37 °C with aeration toA 600 = 0.8–1.0, washed three times at 4 °C with equal volumes of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, and resuspended in the same buffer at 4 ml/g cells (wet weight). Cells were lysed by passage through a French pressure cell (two or three times), and unlysed cells and cell debris were removed by low speed centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). The membrane fraction was isolated by high speed centrifugation (150,000 ×g, 1 h). The supernatant was poured off, and the remaining liquid was removed using a cotton tip applicator. A membrane suspension was obtained by resuspending the pellet in 1% of the original culture volume; the solution contained 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, and 50 mm NaCl. Membranes were not washed unless otherwise indicated. PTS assay mixtures (50 μl) contained 5 mm PEP (or ATP as a control), 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KF, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm indicated radioactive substrate (specific activity, 103 cpm/nmol), 3–5 units (1–2 μg) of Enzyme I, 5–10 μg of HPr, and 0.5–2.5 μg of IIAChb. The membranes contained endogenous IIBChb, but in some experiments (e.g. Fig. 5), 5 μg of homogeneous IIBChb were added to increase the rate of sugar phosphorylation. Reactions were initiated by the addition of membranes (4–8 μl; 20–40 μg of protein) and terminated by placing tubes in a boiling water bath for 5 min. The quantity of sugar phosphate was determined by anion exchange chromatography (12Waygood E.B. Meadow N.D. Roseman S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Protein was determined either by the method of Lowry et al. (14Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by the Bradford Coomassie dye binding assay (15Bradford M. Anal.

The reaction was initiated by adding membranes and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h, after which 5 ml of 95% EtOH was added and the reaction was stopped by boiling for 5 min. Precipitated material was removed by centrifugation; the supernatant contained >95% of the 3H-counts/min in the reaction mixture. The supernatant material was transferred to a Dowex-1 AGX8 resin column (25 ml, bicarbonate form), the column was washed with water, and the sugar phosphate was purified by eluting with a 0–1 m gradient of triethylammonium bicarbonate (500 ml), pH 7.6. The fractions containing the labeled material were pooled, concentrated repeatedly with water to remove the buffer, and applied to a Sephadex G-15 column (45 × 1.2 cm). The final product exhibited a single band on TLC. Approximately 60% of the starting material sugar was converted to the sugar phosphate. Phospho-(GlcNAc)2 was isolated by the same procedure, starting with (GlcNAc)2. 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Bruker AMX-300 spectrometer. The thioglycosidic bond of (phospho)-Me-TCB was hydrolyzed using mercuric acetate (16Krantz M.J. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 71: 318-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) at room temperature. Mixtures contained 10 nmol of thioglycoside and 25 nmol of mercuric acetate in 0.02 m acetic acid. Mercuric ion was removed by Dowex 50 AGX8 (H+ form), and the product was measured by high performance anion exchange chromatography on an system consisting of a Bio-LC (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA), and a Dionex CarboPac PA-1 column (4 × 250 mm) (17Berlin W.K. Miller M.W. Hanover J.A. Trends Genet. 1995; 7: 101-113Google Scholar). (GlcNAc)2 is actively catabolized by both V. furnissii and E. coli and cannot be used to obtain accurate kinetic results in transport experiments. To circumvent this problem, nonmetabolizable analogues were employed to characterize a (GlcNAc)2 transport system in the marine bacterium V. furnissii (10Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33409-33413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Similar experiments were conducted in the present studies on the E. coli transporter. The substrates contained [3H]N-acetyl groups, and were methyl β-N,N′-diacetylchitobiose Me-TCB and methyl α-N,N′,N""-triacetylthiochitotrioside (Me-TCT). Three E. coli strains (6Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14367-14371Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) were employed in these studies: (a) wild type E. coli strain XL1-Blue MR, (b) strain Xm1.4, a transposon insertion mutant of XL1-Blue incapable of utilizing (GlcNAc)2 , and (c) Xm1.4:pES1, the mutant strain harboring a plasmid containing a 7.3-kilobase E. coli genomic fragment that spans the entire chb operon. The transposon was found to be inserted in the chbC gene (the membrane protein) by polymerase chain reaction analysis (data not shown). E. coli strain XL1-Blue was grown in minimal M9 media containing 0.5% lactate supplemented with (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, or Me-TCB. Fig.1 A shows that washed preinduced cells take up the labeled analogues, both the di- and trisaccharide, whereas uninduced cells do not. Uptake of the trisaccharide analogue was less efficient than that of the disaccharide. The following sugars did not act as inducers of the [3H]Me-TCB uptake system: glucose, GlcNAc, maltose, lactose, melibiose, trehalose, cellobiose, salicin, and arbutin. Only (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, and Me-TCB were inducers of the transport system, whereas higher chitin oligosaccharides, (GlcNAC)n, n = 4–6, did not act as inducers. The effect of concentration of (GlcNAc)2 on induction of the transporter is shown in Fig. 1 B. It is interesting to note, although probably coincidental, that about 0.6 mm is the optimal concentration of disaccharide for inducing the transport systems in both E. coli and V. furnissii, although these systems function by different mechanisms. With 0.6 mm (GlcNAc)2 as inducer, E. colicells expressed the transport system after 30 min of incubation at 37 °C. The effect of concentration on induction by (GlcNAc)3 and by Me-TCB were not tested, but these compounds were about as effective as (GlcNAc)2 between 0.5 and 1 mm. The mutant strain Xm1.4 is incapable of transporting either analogue under any conditions tested, whereas the complemented strain, Xm1.4:pES1, displayed the inducible transport system. The rate of transport in the complemented mutant was greater than wild type, both for Me-TCB and Me-TCT, which probably reflects the multiple copy number of the plasmid when compared with the single copy of the gene in the wild type cell. Kinetic studies on the transport of the labeled analogues were conducted with two E. coli strains, XL1-Blue (wild type), and the transformant, Xm1.4:pES1. Initial uptake rates were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures,” with the first time point taken at 6 s after mixing the labeled analogue with the cell suspension. The effects of substrate concentrations on the uptake rates are shown in Fig. 2. The data were analyzed by Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plots (ν versusν/S; data not shown) to obtain the correspondingK m and V max values. A summary of the calculated apparent kinetic constants of transport is given in Table I. The K m for the disaccharide in both the wild type and Xm1.4:pES1 strains were similar (50–100 μm), whereas theV max observed for Xm1.4:pES1 was 3-fold higher than that of wild type (see above). Similarily, theK m for the trisaccharide was determined to be between 300 and 400 μm, with an approximately 8–10-fold higher rate of transport observed in Xm1.4:pES1 than the wild type strain.Table IKinetic constants of (GlcNAc)2 permeaseOrganism and substrateK mV maxμmnmol/min/mgE. coli XL1-Blue MR β-Me-TCB50–1000.6–5.0 α-Me-TCT300–4000.2–0.5E. coli Xm1.4:pCBU7.3 β-Me-TCB50–1003.2–15.0 α-Me-TCT300–4003.1–6.0The K m and V max values are derived from Woolf-Augustinsson-Hofstee plots (34Segel I.H.

We stress that a single cell preparation gave reproducible values. Three aliquots were used to determine uptake at each time point, and the triplicates agreed within a maximum of 10%. The specificity of the transporter was analyzed by competition experiments with potential substrates or inhibitors of the permease. These were performed by determining the initial rates of uptake of [3H]Me-TCB (6–60 s) in the presence and absence of various sugars. The potential inhibitors were tested at 4–6 concentrations, whereas the substrate concentration was 10 μm. Lactose and maltose were inactive, requiring >500 μm for 50% inhibition. Apparent competitors of Me-TCB uptake were (GlcNAc)2, (GlcNAc)3, cellobiose, GlcNAc, and glucose. The concentrations of inhibitors that gave 50% inhibition of Me-TCB uptake were 5–10 μm (GlcNAc)2, 50–100 μm (GlcNAc)3, 50–100 μm cellobiose, and 50–100 μm GlcNAc and glucose. One possible explanation for the inhibition by GlcNAc and glucose is that they compete with the analogue for components of the PTS, which they share, such as PEP, Enzyme I, etc. (lactose and maltose are not PTS sugars in E. coli). The [3H]Me-TCB accumulated by the cells was analyzed by fractionation on Dowex AG1X2 chloride form columns. Me-TCB is a neutral sugar and does not bind to the resin. Transport experiments were conducted as described under “Experimental Procedures” over 60 min (Fig. 3). At each time point, the cells were filtered and quickly washed once with buffer, and the filter was immediately placed in 1 ml of 70% EtOH and boiled for 3 min. A 0.5-ml aliquot of the supernatant was diluted with 3.0 ml of H2O and transferred to a Dowex AG1X2 chloride form column. The column was washed with H2O and eluted with 1 m NaCl as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The counts in the water wash and in the 1 m NaCl eluates are shown in Fig. 3; at each time point, more than 90% of the total radioactivity placed on the column appeared in the 1 m NaCl eluate. The mutant strain Xm1.4 did not transport Me-TCB, whereas results similar to those shown in Fig. 3 were obtained with the mutant strain complemented by the cloned chb operon (Xm1.4:pES1). A parallel experiment was performed with V. furnissii cells; 85–95% of the cpm transferred to the column appeared in the flow through and the water wash fractions (data not shown), and less than 1% was eluted with 1 m NaCl. These results are consistent with the previous observation (10Keyhani N.O. Wang L.-X. Lee Y.C. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33409-33413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) that Me-TCB is transported in unmodified form (or is dephosphorylated faster than can be detected in the assay) in V. furnissii. These results are discussed below, but they indicate that Me-TCB, and presumably the native substrate (GlcNAc)2, are transported by different mechanisms in E. coli and V. furnissii. It appeared likely that the Me-TCB anionic derivative was a phosphate ester. Toluenized cells were therefore used (“Experimental Procedures”) to test this idea, with PEP and ATP as potential phosphoryl donors. Fig. 4 shows that Me-TCB was phosphorylated in the presence of PEP. A very low level of ATP-dependent phosphorylation of Me-TCB was also observed, possibly owing to the generation of small amounts of PEP over this time course. There was no detectable phosphorylation of Me-TCB by toluenized cells of the mutant strain Xm1.4 under any of the conditions tested, whereas similar preparations of Xm1.4:pCBU7.3 phosphorylated Me-TCB at 2–3-fold the rate observed with the wild type cells. Because it appeared that the PTS was catalyzing the phosphorylation of Me-TCB, a mutant strain of XL1-Blue was generated using P1 transduction from strain BL21ΔEI, which contains a kanamycin resistance marker that disrupts Enzyme I of the PTS. This Enzyme I-deficient strain could not ferment the disaccharide, transport [3H]Me-TCB, or phosphorylate the substrate in the toluenized cell assay in the presence of either PEP or ATP (data not shown). The PTS system can be reconstituted in vitro by adding homogenous Enzyme I and HPr to a membrane fraction containing the permease. Membranes were prepared from induced wild type, mutant, and Xm1.4:pES1 E. coli cells (as well as from uninduced cells of each strain). As expected, Xm1.4:pES1 membranes gave the highest activity and were used in the experiments described below. Similar results were obtained using membranes from wild type cells that had been induced with (GlcNAc)2 . No phosphorylation of Me-TCB was detected in the initial experiments with membranes supplemented with Enzyme I, HPr, PEP, and Mg2+. When the protein IIAGlc was added to the mixture, the same result was obtained. It therefore appeared likely that the missing components were (GlcNAc)2-specific proteins. This was in accord with an analysis of the chboperon, which suggested that it encoded two additional soluble components of the transport system designated IIAChb and IIBChb, respectively (the membrane protein is IICChb). Me-TCB phosphorylation was detected only when the components of the reaction mixture listed above were supplemented with an aliquot of high speed supernatant (cell extract). To definitively determine whether the putative IIA and/or IIB protein was required for Me-TCB phosphorylation, the individual proteins were subcloned into an overexpression vector and purified to homogeneity (see accompanying papers (1Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 2Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol.

A complete reaction mixture containing purified Enzyme I, HPr, IIAChb, Xm1.4:pCBU membranes, and PEP resulted in Me-TCB phosphorylation (Fig.5). Presumably, the membranes contained sufficient bound IIBChb to serve its required catalytic role because exogenous IIBChb was not required. When added, exogenous IIBChb increased the rate of phosphorylation about 2-fold. No phosphorylation of Me-TCB was detected in the following controls: omission of any of the components listed above, substitution of IIAGlc for IIAChb, or membranes from the transposon mutant, Xm1.4. Uninduced cells yielded membranes that exhibited less than 5% of the activity observed with the membranes from induced cells; the addition of purified IIBChb to the membranes from uninduced cells had no effect. To isolate and characterize phospho-Me-TCB, the reaction mixture described above was scaled up to 5 mg of Me-TCB (see “Experimental Procedures”). The phospho-Me-TCB was separated from unreacted Me-TCB, PEP, and Pi by ion exchange chromatography, followed by Sephadex G-15 chromatography (“Experimental Procedures”). The final product was obtained in a yield of about 50%. Essentially the same procedure was used for preparing phos"

NuMA, the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, is a protein that shows a striking change in localization during the cell cycle moving from the nuclear matrix in interphase to the spindle poles in mitotic cells (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This change in location is accompanied by specific changes in phosphorylation of the NuMA molecule (2Compton D.A. Luo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 621-633PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sparks C.A. Fey E.G. Vidair C.A. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably also by changes in the binding partners with which NuMA interacts. In interphase NuMA is a component of the nuclear matrix since it remains insoluble after DNase and high salt treatments of the nucleus. It is also resistant to extraction by non-ionic detergents, but it can be solubilized by high concentrations of urea (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NuMA can bind specifically to DNA matrix regions (6Luderus M.E. den Blaauwen J.L. de Smit O.J. Compton D.A. van Driel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also binds to the nonerythroid isoform of protein 4.1R located within the nucleus (7Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).Transient overexpression of NuMA in HeLa cells results in regular nuclear networks that fill the nucleus, are stable to detergent extraction, and can be visualized by electron microscopy. Immunoelectron microscopy shows that these nuclear lattices are built from NuMA (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that recombinant NuMA expressed in Escherichia coli can self-assemble in vitro under physiological salt conditions into a novel higher order structure, the multiarm oligomer. Computer modeling suggests that these oligomers could be the structural unit of the lattices seen in electron microscopy in the nuclei of cells transfected with NuMA (9Harborth J. Wang J. Gueth-Hallonet C. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These lattices could possibly provide a framework where nuclear processes such as transcription take place.The importance of NuMA in interphase as well as the fact that it plays an essential role in mitosis (4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Yang C.H. Snyder M. Mol. Biol.

Ramyar K. Vechio J.D. Cleveland D.W. Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) suggest that it would be of interest to characterize binding partners. We therefore used the yeast two-hybrid system (13Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) to screen a HeLa library for proteins that interact with NuMA. Our screen has revealed surprisingly that the protein product of a gene previously shown to be amplified in gliomas (GAS41) is a binding partner for NuMA. GAS41 is amplified in 23% of glioblastomas and in 80% of grade I astrocytomas.GAS41 was the first gene shown to be amplified in low grade glioma, and its definition showed that gene amplification is not limited to late events in tumor progression (14Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report that GAS41 is a highly conserved protein since homologs to the human form were found in Arabidopsis, Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, and yeast. We further show that GAS41 is a nuclear protein giving a dotted pattern in interphase cells and is present in a variety of human tissues. The specific interaction of GAS41 with NuMA was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation experiments and surface plasmon resonance binding assays.DISCUSSIONA two-hybrid screen using the NuMA C-terminal half as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system led to a human cDNA which by sequence was shown to correspond to GAS41. GAS41 specifically interacts with the C-terminal part of the central coiled-coil region of NuMA (residues 1048–1700). The C-terminal 50 residues of GAS41 were necessary for NuMA binding in the two-hybrid system. Dot overlays provided independent proof that the C-terminal part of the coiled-coil rod region of NuMA binds to GAS41 since construct λ2b, covering residues 670–1700, showed a strong reaction, whereas the N-terminal construct λ1a covering residues 1–851 did not. Independent evidence for the interaction between NuMA and GAS41, as well as the kinetic constants for association and dissociation of the NuMA-GAS41 complex were provided by surface plasmon resonance studies (Fig. 9). The NuMA fragment λ2b bound 3500 times more strongly to GAS41 than did λ1a. The calculated dissociation constant of the NuMA-GAS41 complex is 2 × 10−7m, and this is in the range commonly found for the interaction of cytoskeletal components (25Weiss E.E. Kroemker M. Rudiger A.H. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).GAS41 is highly conserved among species as diverse as fungi, yeast, plants, and man (Fig. 3). Thus GAS41 is a general eukaryotic nuclear protein. This provides a handle to examine directly the function of GAS41, for instance by making knockouts in mice or C. elegans.Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA for GAS41 was expressed in all eight human tissues that were tested. Immunohistochemistry with GAS41-specific antibodies showed a nuclear-specific localization in interphase cells. Interphase nuclei were stained in a punctate fashion (Fig. 7 A). An independent determination of the cellular localization of GAS41 used cells transfected with a GFP-GAS41 construct. In interphase cells again a punctate nuclear distribution of GAS41 was seen both in fixed cells assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy and in living cells analyzed for the distribution of the GFP construct (Fig. 7 C). Further experiments using methods with higher resolution (for example 4Pi microscopy) are needed to see if GAS41 colocalizes to a subfraction of NuMA dots reported for instance with the NuMA 705 antibody (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells GAS41 and NuMA have different localizations. GAS41 is found throughout the cell (Fig.7 B), and NuMA is associated with spindle poles (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The sequence homology of GAS41 with the human AF-9 and ENL proteins is intriguing (Fig. 4 and Ref. 14Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AF-9 is found fused to theALL-1 gene in leukemias with t(9:11) translocations, and ENL is found fused to the ALL-1 gene in leukemias with t(11:19) translocations. The fact that AF-9 and ENL have extensive sequence homology as well as several shared sequence motifs (e.g. a nuclear targeting sequence, serine-rich domains and stretches rich in proline or in basic amino acids) has led to the suggestion that the functional activities of the proteins coded for by AF-9 and ENL are related and are important in leukemia (24Nakamura T. Alder H. Gu Y. Prasad R. Canaani O. Kamada N. Gale R.P. Lange B. Crist W.M. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Many genes associated with translocations in acute leukemia code for transcription factors (26Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar) leaving open the question whether AF-9 and ENL might also code for such proteins (cf. Ref. 24Nakamura T. Alder H. Gu Y. Prasad R. Canaani O. Kamada N. Gale R.P. Lange B. Crist W.M. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An artificially constructed gene which fused the AF-9 gene to the mouse MII (ALL-1) gene by homologous recombination has been shown to cause acute leukemia in chimeric mice (27Corral J. Lavenir I. Impey H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Larson T.A. Bell S. McKenzie A.N. King G. Rabbitts T.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). GAS41 is shorter than AF-9 and ENL, and in contrast to these two proteins lacks a typical DNA-binding domain for transcriptional activation (Fig. 4). However, GAS41 could activate transcription together with a second protein that contains a DNA-binding domain.We speculate that the interaction between NuMA and GAS41 shown here may provide a direct link between nuclear architecture and gene expression. We have shown elsewhere that NuMA has the ability to polymerize into lattice-like structures in vivo (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and we have also shown that NuMA can self-assemble in vitro into multiarm oligomers, which may be the structural unit for a nuclear scaffold (9Harborth J. Wang J. Gueth-Hallonet C. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Obviously, to prove such a link further evidence has to be provided to show that GAS41 is involved in transcription and to define the nature and stoichiometry of the GAS41-NuMA complex. The knowledge of proteins that form the nuclear skeletal structure in interphase is still incomplete. NuMA, the nuclear mitotic apparatus protein, is a protein that shows a striking change in localization during the cell cycle moving from the nuclear matrix in interphase to the spindle poles in mitotic cells (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This change in location is accompanied by specific changes in phosphorylation of the NuMA molecule (2Compton D.A. Luo C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 621-633PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sparks C.A. Fey E.G. Vidair C.A. Doxsey S.J. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar) and presumably also by changes in the binding partners with which NuMA interacts. In interphase NuMA is a component of the nuclear matrix since it remains insoluble after DNase and high salt treatments of the nucleus. It is also resistant to extraction by non-ionic detergents, but it can be solubilized by high concentrations of urea (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2447-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). NuMA can bind specifically to DNA matrix regions (6Luderus M.E. den Blaauwen J.L. de Smit O.J. Compton D.A. van Driel R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6297-6305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It also binds to the nonerythroid isoform of protein 4.1R located within the nucleus (7Mattagajasingh S.N. Huang S.C. Hartenstein J.S. Snyder M. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 29-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of NuMA in HeLa cells results in regular nuclear networks that fill the nucleus, are stable to detergent extraction, and can be visualized by electron microscopy. Immunoelectron microscopy shows that these nuclear lattices are built from NuMA (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that recombinant NuMA expressed in Escherichia coli can self-assemble in vitro under physiological salt conditions into a novel higher order structure, the multiarm oligomer. Computer modeling suggests that these oligomers could be the structural unit of the lattices seen in electron microscopy in the nuclei of cells transfected with NuMA (9Harborth J. Wang J. Gueth-Hallonet C. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1689-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). These lattices could possibly provide a framework where nuclear processes such as transcription take place. The importance of NuMA in interphase as well as the fact that it plays an essential role in mitosis (4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 10Yang C.H. Snyder M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1259-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 11Gaglio T. Saredi A.

Cell. 1996; 87: 447-458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) suggest that it would be of interest to characterize binding partners. We therefore used the yeast two-hybrid system (13Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) to screen a HeLa library for proteins that interact with NuMA. Our screen has revealed surprisingly that the protein product of a gene previously shown to be amplified in gliomas (GAS41) is a binding partner for NuMA. GAS41 is amplified in 23% of glioblastomas and in 80% of grade I astrocytomas.GAS41 was the first gene shown to be amplified in low grade glioma, and its definition showed that gene amplification is not limited to late events in tumor progression (14Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Here we report that GAS41 is a highly conserved protein since homologs to the human form were found in Arabidopsis, Drosophila,Caenorhabditis elegans, and yeast. We further show that GAS41 is a nuclear protein giving a dotted pattern in interphase cells and is present in a variety of human tissues. The specific interaction of GAS41 with NuMA was confirmed in vitro by immunoprecipitation experiments and surface plasmon resonance binding assays. DISCUSSIONA two-hybrid screen using the NuMA C-terminal half as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system led to a human cDNA which by sequence was shown to correspond to GAS41. GAS41 specifically interacts with the C-terminal part of the central coiled-coil region of NuMA (residues 1048–1700). The C-terminal 50 residues of GAS41 were necessary for NuMA binding in the two-hybrid system. Dot overlays provided independent proof that the C-terminal part of the coiled-coil rod region of NuMA binds to GAS41 since construct λ2b, covering residues 670–1700, showed a strong reaction, whereas the N-terminal construct λ1a covering residues 1–851 did not. Independent evidence for the interaction between NuMA and GAS41, as well as the kinetic constants for association and dissociation of the NuMA-GAS41 complex were provided by surface plasmon resonance studies (Fig. 9). The NuMA fragment λ2b bound 3500 times more strongly to GAS41 than did λ1a. The calculated dissociation constant of the NuMA-GAS41 complex is 2 × 10−7m, and this is in the range commonly found for the interaction of cytoskeletal components (25Weiss E.E. Kroemker M. Rudiger A.H. Jockusch B.M. Rudiger M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 755-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).GAS41 is highly conserved among species as diverse as fungi, yeast, plants, and man (Fig. 3). Thus GAS41 is a general eukaryotic nuclear protein. This provides a handle to examine directly the function of GAS41, for instance by making knockouts in mice or C. elegans.Northern blot analysis showed that the mRNA for GAS41 was expressed in all eight human tissues that were tested. Immunohistochemistry with GAS41-specific antibodies showed a nuclear-specific localization in interphase cells. Interphase nuclei were stained in a punctate fashion (Fig. 7 A). An independent determination of the cellular localization of GAS41 used cells transfected with a GFP-GAS41 construct. In interphase cells again a punctate nuclear distribution of GAS41 was seen both in fixed cells assayed by immunofluorescence microscopy and in living cells analyzed for the distribution of the GFP construct (Fig. 7 C). Further experiments using methods with higher resolution (for example 4Pi microscopy) are needed to see if GAS41 colocalizes to a subfraction of NuMA dots reported for instance with the NuMA 705 antibody (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In mitotic cells GAS41 and NuMA have different localizations. GAS41 is found throughout the cell (Fig.7 B), and NuMA is associated with spindle poles (1Lydersen B.K. Pettijohn D.E. Cell. 1980; 22: 489-499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 4Kallajoki M. Weber K. Osborn M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3351-3362Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).The sequence homology of GAS41 with the human AF-9 and ENL proteins is intriguing (Fig. 4 and Ref. 14Fischer U. Heckel D. Michel A. Janka M. Hulsebos T. Meese E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1997; 6: 1817-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). AF-9 is found fused to theALL-1 gene in leukemias with t(9:11) translocations, and ENL is found fused to the ALL-1 gene in leukemias with t(11:19) translocations. The fact that AF-9 and ENL have extensive sequence homology as well as several shared sequence motifs (e.g. a nuclear targeting sequence, serine-rich domains and stretches rich in proline or in basic amino acids) has led to the suggestion that the functional activities of the proteins coded for by AF-9 and ENL are related and are important in leukemia (24Nakamura T. Alder H. Gu Y. Prasad R. Canaani O. Kamada N. Gale R.P. Lange B. Crist W.M. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Many genes associated with translocations in acute leukemia code for transcription factors (26Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar) leaving open the question whether AF-9 and ENL might also code for such proteins (cf. Ref. 24Nakamura T. Alder H. Gu Y. Prasad R. Canaani O. Kamada N. Gale R.P. Lange B. Crist W.M. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4631-4635Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). An artificially constructed gene which fused the AF-9 gene to the mouse MII (ALL-1) gene by homologous recombination has been shown to cause acute leukemia in chimeric mice (27Corral J. Lavenir I.

GAS41 is shorter than AF-9 and ENL, and in contrast to these two proteins lacks a typical DNA-binding domain for transcriptional activation (Fig. 4). However, GAS41 could activate transcription together with a second protein that contains a DNA-binding domain.We speculate that the interaction between NuMA and GAS41 shown here may provide a direct link between nuclear architecture and gene expression. We have shown elsewhere that NuMA has the ability to polymerize into lattice-like structures in vivo (8Gueth-Hallonet C. Wang J. Harborth J. Weber K. Osborn N. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 243: 434-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and we have also shown that NuMA can self-assemble in vitro into multiarm oligomers, which may be the structural unit for a nuclear scaffold (9Harborth J.

Glucocorticoids, retinoic acid, and glucagon (via its second messenger, cAMP) stimulate PEPCK gene transcription, whereas insulin, phorbol esters, cytokines, and oxidative stress have an opposing effect. Stimulation of PEPCK gene expression has been extensively studied, and a number of important DNA elements and binding proteins that regulate the transcription of this gene have been identified. However, the mechanisms utilized to turn off expression of this gene are not well-defined. Many of the negative regulators of PEPCK gene transcription also stimulate the nuclear localization and activation of the transcription factor NF-κB, so we hypothesized that this factor could be involved in the repression of PEPCK gene expression. We find that the p65 subunit of NF-κB represses the increase of PEPCK gene transcription mediated by glucocorticoids and cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. The mutation of an NF-κB binding element identified in the PEPCK gene promoter fails to abrogate this repression.

A detailed analysis of the PEPCK promoter has revealed that each hormone response is mediated by a set of DNA elements that comprise a complex hormone response unit. For instance, the glucocorticoid response unit (GRU), which is positioned between −455 and −86 relative to the transcription start site, is required for the stimulatory effect of glucocorticoids. The GRU includes two glucocorticoid receptor binding sites (GR1 and GR2), three accessory factor binding sites (gAF1, gAF2, and gAF3), and a cAMP response element (CRE) (7Imai E. Stromstedt P.E.

Although the hormone response units that confer stimulation of PEPCK gene transcription are well characterized, the mechanisms that lead to repression of PEPCK transcription are not fully understood.

Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). This observation led to the suggestion that another element, acting more proximal to this IRS, is also involved in this response (designated by X in Fig.1). Alternatively, insulin and the other negative regulators of PEPCK gene transcription could also work by disrupting protein·protein interactions necessary for communication between transcription factors and coactivators with the basal transcriptional machinery. Insulin stimulates signaling pathways that lead to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and p38 MAPK in hepatoma cells (20Sutherland C. Tebbey P.W. Granner D.K. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 26Gabbay R.A. Sutherland C. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Flier J.S. J. Biol.

Two well-characterized PI3K inhibitors block the action of insulin on PEPCK gene expression, so this enzyme is assumed to be involved in insulin-mediated repression of the PEPCK gene (27Sutherland C.

A variety of experimental approaches were used to show that neither MAPK nor p38 MAPK is involved in the insulin response of PEPCK gene transcription (20Sutherland C. Tebbey P.W. Granner D.K.

Insulin also stimulates signaling pathways that result in the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB in the liver (28Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol.

Interestingly, many of the other repressors of PEPCK gene transcription (such as phorbol esters, oxidative stress, and various cytokines) stimulate the nuclear localization of NF-κB wherein it serves as a transcription factor (31Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 32Baeuerle P.A. Curr.

Conversely, activators of PEPCK gene transcription, such as glucocorticoids and cAMP, inhibit nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB (34Neumann M. Grieshammer T. Chuvpilo S. Kneitz B. Lohoff M. Schimpl A. Franza Jr., B.R. Serfling E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1991-2004Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NF-κB is a ubiquitous transcription factor whose properties have been characterized primarily in cells of the immune system. In addition to its role in the immune response and inflammation, NF-κB is involved in cell cycle progression (35Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) and in liver development and regeneration (36Cressman D.E. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30429-30435Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The critical role NF-κB plays in hepatic development is underscored by the observation that p65 knockout mice die before birth from massive degeneration of the liver due to apoptosis (37Beg A.A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors includes the subunits p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and RelB. These proteins share an N-terminal region of homology, known as the rel homology domain, that is important for DNA binding and dimerization. Two transactivation domains are found in the C-terminal region of p65, c-Rel, and RelB, but these are lacking in p50 and p52 (31Baeuerle P.A. Henkel T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 141-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (4602) Google Scholar, 38Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In the cytoplasm, NF-κB binds to the inhibitory protein, IκB, to form an inactive NF-κB·IκB complex (39Beg A.A. Ruben S.M. Scheinman R.I. Haskill S. Rosen C.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1899-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). Most agents that activate NF-κB do so by stimulating the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκB, thus allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and regulate transcription (40Beg A.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2064-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 41Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). NF-κB regulates transcription by several different mechanisms. In most cases, NF-κB activates transcription by binding to an NF-κB element and interacting with the basal transcription machinery (38Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar,42Kerr L.D. Ransone L.J. Wamsley P. Schmitt M.J. Boyer T.G. Zhou Q. Berk A.J. Verma I.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 412-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, NF-κB represses transcription in the presence of a corepressor, such as the Drosophila proteins dorsal switch or Groucho (43Lehming N. Thanos D. Brickman J.M. Ma J. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 44Kirov N. Zhelnin L. Shah J. Rushlow C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3193-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 45Dubnicoff T.

NF-κB also represses transcription by interacting directly with transcription factors, such as GR, or by competing with other factors for binding to coactivators, such as p300, CBP, or SRC-1 (46Sheppard K.A. Phelps K.M. Williams A.J. Thanos D. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Gerritsen M.E. Collins T. J. Biol.

We now have evidence that the p65 subunit of NF-κB represses PEPCK gene transcription, in a DNA-independent fashion, by disrupting the coactivation function of CBP. These data suggest that the NF-κB signaling pathway contributes to the repression of hormone-activated PEPCK gene expression. H4IIE or HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 2.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (3Petersen D.D.

Cells were pelleted and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 2 ml of a calcium phosphate:DNA co-precipitate containing plasmid DNA. Cells were then plated in 10-cm2 culture dishes and incubated at 37 °C. After 4 h, cells were treated with 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide in serum-containing medium for 5 min, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in serum-free media for 18 h. In certain experiments, cells were treated for 18 h with 500 nmdexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (8CPT-cAMP), 10 nm insulin, 1 μm PMA, 1 ng/ml TNF-α, or 160 ng/ml IL-6. Cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and sonicated in 200 μl of 250 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8. Following sonication, the extracts were heated for 10 min at 65 °C, and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. CAT assays were performed using the supernatant as described previously (7Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 4712-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). CAT activity was normalized for the protein concentration in the cell lysate by using the Pierce BCA assay. EMSA was performed as described previously (28Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). H4IIE cells were incubated in serum-free media with 500 nmdexamethasone and 0.1 mm 8CPT-cAMP, in the presence or absence of 10 nm insulin, 1 mmH2O2, or 1 μm PMA for 4 h. Subsequently, cells were washed twice in 5 ml of ice-cold, phosphate-buffered saline and were harvested by centrifugation. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na4P2O7, 0.4 mm Na2MoO4, 0.125 μmokadaic acid, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). After homogenization in a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer, cell lysates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min, and nuclear pellets were resuspended in buffer B (buffer A containing 420 mm NaCl and 20% glycerol). The resuspended nuclei were exposed to consistent agitation for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used for DNA-binding reactions. Protein amounts were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent. Oligonucleotides corresponding to the NF-κB binding site were annealed and end-labeled using polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]dATP: 5′-TCAGAGGGGACTTTCCGAGAGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTGA-3′. DNA-binding reactions were performed in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) using 5 μg of nuclear protein and the labeled NF-κB probe (approximately 60,000–75,000 counts/min per reaction). For supershift assays, reactions were performed in the presence or absence of 1 μg of antibody specific for p65, c-Rel, RelB, p50, or p52. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in TAE buffer (7 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 3 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA). The plasmid pPL32 contains the PEPCK promoter sequence from −467 to +69, relative to the transcription start site, ligated to the CAT reporter gene, as described previously (3Petersen D.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The mutation of pPL32 to make the construct pPL32 (mκB) was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the oligonucleotides 5′-CCCTTGGCCAACAGCTCAAATCCGGCGAGAC-3′ and 5′-TCTCGCCGGATTTGAGCTGTTGGCCAAGGG-3′. The p65 mutants were also constructed using the QuikChange kit. The following oligonucleotides were used to construct these mutants: ΔRHD, 5′-GCCTCTGGCCCCTATGTGGCCATTGTGTTCCGG-3′ and 5′-CCGGAACACAATGGCCACATAGGGGCCAGAGGC-3′; ΔTA, 5′-CGTAAAAGGACATAAGGGGGTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCACCCCCTTATGTCCTTTTACG-3′; S276A, 5′-CTGCGGCGGCCTGCCGACCGGGAGCTC-3′ and 5′-GAGCTCCCGGTCGGCAGGCCGCCGCAG-3′. The DNA sequence of each mutant was verified. Radioisotopes ([γ-32P]dATP and [3H]sodium acetate) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and ICN, respectively. Insulin was purchased from Collaborative Bioproducts. 8CPT-cAMP was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies specific to p50 or p65 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Dexamethasone and H2O2 were purchased from Sigma, IL-6 was purchased from Promega, and TNF-α from RD Research. The ability of insulin and phorbol esters (PMA) to repress PEPCK mRNA expression has been extensively documented (18Sasaki K. Cripe T.P. Koch S.R. Andreone T.L. Petersen D.D. Beale E.G. Granner D.K.

Given the central role of PEPCK in maintaining gluconeogenesis, several investigators postulated that the hypoglycemia commonly associated with endotoxemia could result from decreased expression of this hepatic enzyme. In rats, endotoxin treatment is believed to result in the release of the proinflammatory cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-α, all of which reduce PEPCK mRNA in rat hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells (21Hill M.R. McCallum R.E. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 4040-4050Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Christ B. Nath A. Heinrich P.C. Jungermann K.

Interestingly, each of the agents that repress PEPCK gene expression promotes the nuclear localization and activation of NF-κB (28Zhou G. Kuo M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15174-15183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 30Bertrand F. Atfi A. Cadoret A. L'Allemain G. Robin H. Lascols O. Capeau J. Cherqui G. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1996; 10: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (1781) Google Scholar). In view of these results, we decided to determine whether the different NF-κB subunits have an effect on PEPCK gene transcription. Transient transfection experiments were conducted to determine if the p65 or p50 subunits of NF-κB repress PEPCK gene expression. We chose to focus on these subunits, because they are expressed and activated in the cell lines used in our experiments (see below). Experiments designed to examine PEPCK gene expression were performed by co-transfecting pPL32 (a plasmid with the wild type −467 to +69 sequence of the PEPCK promoter located upstream of a CAT reporter gene) with either the catalytic subunit of PKA or the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), to enhance the expression of the gene. HepG2 cells were transfected with the PKA expression vector, which results in a 10- to 12-fold induction of PEPCK gene expression in response to this effector. The expression of p65 effectively repressed the PKA response in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas p50 expression had no effect (Fig. 2 A). The same experiments were performed to examine the effects of p65 or p50 on glucocorticoid-mediated induction of pPL32. H4IIE hepatoma cells were used for these experiments, because they give a more robust response to glucocorticoids than do HepG2 cells. Increasing amounts of p65 also repressed the glucocorticoid response, whereas p50 had a small effect (Fig. 2 B). We were not able to compare the level of protein expression of p65 and p50 due to the low transfection efficiency of H4IIE and HepG2 cells. We were able to show by Western blot in COS-1 cells, however, that the p50 expression vector does express protein (data not shown). It is possible that p50 is expressed at a lower level than p65 and that higher p50 protein levels would further repress PEPCK gene transcription. We chose not to transfect higher amounts of the p50 expression vector, however, because higher amounts of the empty expression vector had a repressive effect on PEPCK gene expression. For subsequent studies, we chose to examine the role of p65 on PEPCK gene expression. To confirm that the effects of p65 on PEPCK gene expression were not due to a direct repressive effect on transcription, or to a direct inhibition of CAT activity, p65 was co-transfected with a reporter plasmid that has six HIV long terminal repeat κB elements positioned upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter and the CAT reporter gene (referred to as 6xκB/CAT). A 2- to 3-fold stimulation of transcription was observed, whereas no stimulation (or inhibition) of the parent vector TK-CAT was seen (Fig. 2 C). We were unable to use p50 for these experiments, because this protein lacks a transactivation domain and so does not activate 6xκB/CAT. As mentioned above, NF-κB can mediate transcription in a DNA binding-dependent or -independent manner. Therefore, the PEPCK promoter was examined for potential κB elements, which consist of the consensus sequence GGGRNNYYCC (38Grimm S. Baeuerle P.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 297-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). A site resembling this consensus κB element (GGGGAAATCC) was identified at position +40 to +49 relative to the transcription start site in the PEPCK promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed using oligonucleotides that correspond to this site, or to a consensus κB site, and nuclear extracts isolated from H4IIE cells (Fig.3 A). DNA binding activity by NF-κB was detected in cells incubated in serum-free DMEM. This is consistent with other reports that describe the presence of NF-κB in the nucleus of untreated hepatoma cells (53Chang K.S. Hsu M.L. Josephs S.F. Cancer Lett. 1993; 74: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). As expected, nuclear extracts obtained after the treatment of H4IIE cells with a combination of dexamethasone and cAMP (Dex/cAMP) provided a reduced formation of the NF-κB·DNA complex, as compared with untreated cells. However, DNA binding by the NF-κB in nuclear extracts was increased in response to treatment of cells with insulin, hydrogen peroxide, and PMA (all of which are inhibitors of PEPCK gene transcription), even in cells that had been treated with Dex/cAMP, showing that these compounds overcome the repressive effect of Dex/cAMP on DNA binding. The consensus sequence oligonucleotide bound one protein complex, whereas the oligonucleotide corresponding to the PEPCK sequence bound two protein complexes (Fig. 3 A). Supershift analyses using antibodies specific for the p50 or p65 subunits of NF-κB revealed that the consensus oligonucleotide bound to a p50/p65 heterodimer. The c-Rel, RelB, and p52 subunits w"

Enzymes involved in this maturation belong to the subtilisin-like endoprotease family (convertases). To understand the role of the α subunit cleavage in integrin function, we have designed stable transfectants (PDX39P cells) expressing α1-PDX, a convertase inhibitor. Immunoprecipitation of cell surface proteins from PDX39P showed that α3, α6 and αvintegrins lack endoproteolytic cleavage. We have compared adhesion between PDX39P cells and mock-transfected cells on different extracellular matrix proteins. No difference in adhesion could be observed on laminin-1 and type I collagen, while attachment of PDX39P cells to vitronectin (ligand of the αvβ5integrin) was dramatically reduced. The reduced adhesion of PDX39P cells was not due to changes in integrin affinity as determined by solid-phase receptor assay in a cell-free environment. Intracellular signaling pathways activated by αv integrin ligation were also affected in PDX39P cells. It thus seems that the absence of endoproteolytic cleavage of αv integrins has important consequences on signal transduction pathways leading to alterations in integrin function such as cell adhesion.

The α3, α5, α6, α7, α8, α9, αv, and αIIb subunits are cleaved in the membrane-proximal extracellular region, resulting in a heavy chain that is disulfide-linked to a membrane spanning light chain (2Hemler M. Mecham R. McDonald J. Receptors for Extracellular Matrix Proteins. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1991: 255-299Google Scholar). The α4 and αE subunits can also be cleaved, but at unusual positions, near the middle and in the N-terminal region of the molecule, respectively (3Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J.

Post-translational proteolysis is a common mechanism required for the synthesis of biologically active proteins in bacteria, fungi, yeast, invertebrates, and mammals (5Denault J.-B. Leduc R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 379: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, the role of endoproteolytic cleavage of integrin α subunits is not clear. The cleavage is conserved, not only in different α chains but also across species, suggesting that it might be of functional importance. It has been established, by site-directed mutagenesis of cleavage sites, that uncleaved αIIbβ3 and α4β1 are able to mediate cell adhesion to their ligands (3Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D.

However, it has been reported that a defect in α6 cleavage impairs the inside/out signaling of uncleaved α6β1 integrins induced by phorbol ester, indicating that cleavage is necessary for proper integrin function (7Delwel G.O.

The search for mammalian analogues of kexin, a yeast endoprotease, has led to the discovery of the subtilisin/kexin-like family of proprotein convertases. These calcium-dependent serine proteases can be subdivided into four groups according to their cellular localization and tissue distribution (for reviews and updates, see Refs. 8Steiner D.

Furin and PC7, belonging to the first group, are widely expressed in tissues and mainly localized to the trans-Golgi network. PC1 and PC2 are primarily expressed in neural and endocrine cells and are found essentially within secretory granules. The third group includes PC5A and PACE4, widely distributed in tissues and localized within the trans-Golgi network and secretory granules, and PC5B (also called PC6), mostly found within thetrans-Golgi network. PC4, exclusively expressed in germ cells, constitutes the fourth group. The general consensus sequence cleaved by these enzymes contains the motif (K/R)-X n-(K/R)↓, where n = 0, 2, 4, or 6. In vitro and phage display data revealed that theX residue and those following the cleavage site define the fine specificity of each enzyme (12Matthews D. Goodman L. Gorman C. Wells J.

Due to their potential pharmacological interest, several inhibitors of proprotein convertases have been designed (14Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In humans, a naturally occurring mutation of α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT), known as α1-AT Pittsburgh, changes the specificity of this serpin from an inhibitor of elastase into a potent inhibitor of thrombin (15Owen M. Brennan S. Lewis J. Carrel R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Another variant of α1-AT, called α1-AT Portland (α1-PDX), has been engineered by Anderson et al. (16Anderson E. Thomas L. Hayflick J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and described as a potent inhibitor of convertases. Recent findings shows that α1-PDX is a selective inhibitor for furin and, to a lesser extent, for PC5B (14Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This inhibitor blocks the convertases dependent processing of various precursors (17Denault J.-B. D'Orléans-Juste P. Masaki T.

J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we showed that α3, α6, and αv integrin subunits are not processed in the furin-deficient LoVo-C5 cell. Moreover, pro-forms of α integrin subunits are cleaved both by recombinant convertasesin vitro and ex vivo after overexpression in LoVo cells (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J.

In the present study, we investigated the functional importance of the α subunits cleavage during the interaction of integrins with ECM proteins. We have designed stable transfectants of α1-PDX in HT29-D4 adenocarcinoma cells. These transfected cells, bearing uncleaved integrin α subunits, displayed a reduced attachment to vitronectin. This alteration was correlated with defects in the intracellular signaling pathways activated by αvintegrin ligation. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy-Pontoise, France) and fetal bovine serum from BioWhittaker (Fontenay-sous-Bois, France). PBS was from Oxoid (Basingstoke, United Kingdom). The synthetic peptides RGDS and RGES, Pseudomonas exotoxin A, BSA, type I collagen, poly-l-lysine, and crystal violet were obtained from Sigma (St-Quentin Fallavier, France). Sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin) was from Pierce. TMB peroxidase EIA substrate kit was obtained from Bio-Rad (Ivry-sur-Seine, France) and protein G-agarose beads from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Meylan, France). The light-based ECL detection kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Les Ulis, France). Laminin-1 and vitronectin were prepared according to Timpl et al. (24Timpl R. Rohde H. Gehron-Robey P.

Lissitzky J.-C. Quaranta V. Pichon J. Marvaldi J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2102-2107PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse mAb M-Kid2 (anti-α3), mouse mAb AMF-7 (anti-αv), and rat mAb GoH3 (anti-α6) were from Immunotech (Marseille, France). Anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibody was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Mouse mAbs anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) and anti-paxillin (clone 349) were from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Rabbit polyclonal anti-FAK antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Sheep anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulins conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HT29-D4 cells, derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma, were transfected with a pBK-CMV expression vector containing the full-length α1-PDX cDNA (gift of G. Thomas, Portland, OR). Clones of stable transfected cells (controlled by Northern blot) were isolated and tested for their sensitivity toPseudomonas exotoxin A (PEA), a toxin activated after cleavage by convertases, which has proved to be an indicative assay for furin activity (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 27Moehring J. Inocencio N. Robertson B. Moehring T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the clones tested, the clone PDX39 presented a pronounced increase in PEA resistance compared with HT29-D4 cells or to the clone PDX0 transfected with the empty vector. To generate cells expressing higher levels of α1-PDX inhibitor, the clone PDX39 was cultured in the presence of 1 μg/ml PEA. This cell subpopulation, resistant to PEA and expressing high levels of α1-PDX (controlled by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), was referred as PDX39P. The cell surface expression of integrin subunits was determined by flow cytometry and by immunoprecipitation of biotinylated cell surface proteins as described elsewhere (28Rigot V. Lehmann M. André F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were performed as described previously (28Rigot V. Lehmann M. André F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kadi A. Pichard V. Lehmann M. Briand C. Braguer D. Marvaldi J. Rognoni J.-B. Luis J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested in single cell suspension by treatment with 0.53 mm EDTA in PBS, added to wells coated with purified ECM proteins, and allowed to adhere to the substrata for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, attached cells were stained by 0.1% crystal violet and lysed with 1% SDS. Absorbance was then measured at 600 nm. Serum-starved cells in suspension were washed twice with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and resuspended in the same buffer containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 500 units/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin, 1 mm iodoacetamide, and 1 mm o-phenanthroline). Cells were disrupted with a Potter homogenizer and homogenate was centrifuged at 600 × gfor 10 min at 4 °C. Plasma membranes were recovered by centrifuging the supernatant at 50,000 × g for 45 min and then solubilized for 45 min at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl (TBS) containing 1%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. MaxiSorbTM microtiter plate wells (Nunc) were coated for 2 h at 37 °C with 10 μg/ml vitronectin in 50 μl of TBS and blocked with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Vitronectin-coated wells were incubated with 100 μl of solubilized membranes (300 μg of protein) overnight at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed by four washes with TBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 and 1% BSA. αv binding was detected by sequential incubations for 1 h at 37 °C with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml mouse mAb AMF-7 and at room temperature with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1/1000) and anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Finally, 100 μl of peroxidase substrate was added for 10 min at room temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of 0.5 mol/liter H2SO4, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Confluent cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% BSA for 24 h at 37 °C. Serum-starved cells were harvested in single cell suspension, added (5 × 106 cells in 1 ml) to 9.6-cm2 wells coated with 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine or vitronectin, and allowed to adhere to the substrata for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, attached cells were lysed with 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (RIPA buffer) containing 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm NaF, and the mixture of protease inhibitors. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and analyzed by immunoblot, after immunoprecipitation, or directly with an anti-active MAPK polyclonal antibody as described previously (30André F. Rigot V. Remacle-Bonnet M. Luis J. Pommier G. Marvaldi J. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 64-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, 600–900 μg of proteins were incubated with 1 μg of anti-FAK or 2 μg of anti-paxillin antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then with protein G-agarose for 45 min. Pellets were washed three times with RIPA buffer, three times with RIPA buffer, 500 mm NaCl, and once with PBS. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a nitrocellulose sheet. Membranes were blocked in PBS, 4% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20 and probed overnight at 4 °C with PY20 antibody in PBS, 0.8% BSA, 0.2% Tween 20. Blots were then visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. When necessary, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-MAPK (1/1000), anti-FAK (0.2 μg/ml), or anti-paxillin (0.1 μg/ml) antibodies. α1-PDX has been described as a potent inhibitor of convertases (16Anderson E. Thomas L. Hayflick J. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are responsible for the cleavage of α integrin subunits (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Lissitzky J. Luis J. Munzer J. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chrétien M. Marvaldi J. Seidah N. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We therefore expressed the α1-PDX inhibitor in HT29-D4 cells, and we selected stable transfectants. The clone PDX39 was further selected on the basis of its resistance to PEA, a toxin activated by convertases (27Moehring J. Inocencio N. Robertson B. Moehring T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2590-2594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to obtain a population (PDX39P cells) expressing high levels of the α1-PDX inhibitor (data not shown). Among the cleavable integrins, HT29-D4 cells express α3β1, α6β4, αvβ5, and αvβ6(26Lehmann M. Rabenandrasana C. Tamura R. Lissitzky J.-C. Quaranta V. Pichon J. Marvaldi J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2102-2107PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rigot V. Lehmann M. André F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α6 subunit is synthesized as a 140-kDa precursor and then converted to a 120-kDa species by endoproteolytic processing (31Rigot V. André F. Lehmann M. Lissitzky J.-C. Marvaldi J. Luis J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 261: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether α1-PDX expression impairs the endoproteolytic processing of α6, cells were surface-biotinylated, and integrins were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies against α6 subunit. Immunopurified proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing (NR) or reducing (R) conditions (Fig.1). As illustrated in Fig. 1 A, nonreduced α6 immunoprecipitates, composed of α6 chains (140 kDa) associated with β4subunits (190 kDa), displayed a similar pattern in the different cell populations. However, when the disulfide bridges were broken, the electrophoretic profiles of α6 immunoprecipitates were obviously different depending on the cell population. Indeed, in HT29-D4 cells and in cells transfected with the empty vector (PDX0 cells), the apparent molecular mass of α6 was reduced from 140 to 120 kDa upon reduction, while a major band of 150 kDa corresponding to noncleaved subunit (α6NC) was observed in PDX39P cells. Only a limited amount of cleaved α6 subunit (α6C) was seen on the gel for PDX39P. These data, similar to those obtained with the cleavage-deficient LoVo cells (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), indicate that in PDX39P the large majority of the α6 integrin subunit was not endoproteolytically processed. In the case of PDX39 cells, about half of the α6 chains were cleaved, confirming that the selection of PDX39 cells in the presence of a high concentration of PEA increased α1-PDX expression and led to a strong impairment of α6 cleavage. These observations were extended to the αv and α3 subunits using the same experimental approach. As seen on Fig. 1 B, most αv chain, that associated with β5 and β6 subunits, failed to be cleaved in PDX39P cells, as observed with α6 subunit. The amount of normally processed α3 is more difficult to evaluate because cleaved form (α3C) comigrated with reduced β1 (Fig. 1 C). However, the bands corresponding to noncleaved (α3NC) and nonreduced α3 chains from PDX39P have the same intensity, suggesting that virtually all α3 subunits are in an uncleaved form. Thus, the expression of high levels of α1-PDX inhibitor blocked almost totally the endoproteolytic maturation of all the cleavable α integrin subunits expressed in PDX39P cells. Moreover, the ratio cleaved/noncleaved form correlated with the expression level of α1-PDX (data not shown). As observed above after cell surface biotinylation and immunoprecipitation, the expression of α1-PDX does not seem to affect the labeling intensity of integrin subunits. To confirm these results by a more quantitative approach, cells were examined for cell surface expression of integrin subunits by indirect immunofluorescence using specific mAbs. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the extent of integrin expression at the cell surface is quite similar whatever the cell population studied (Fig.2). This demonstrates that the defect in α chains processing did not impair the exportation of the heterodimers to the plasma membrane. To examine the importance of the α chain cleavage for integrin function, we first measured the adhesion of transfected cells to purified ECM proteins and to poly-l-lysine as an integrin-independent substrate. Adhesion of PDX39P cells to laminin-1 and collagen type I was quite similar to control cells, as was the attachment to poly-l-lysine (Fig.3 A). On the contrary, adhesion of PDX39P cells to vitronectin was significantly reduced when compared with HT29-D4 or PDX0 cells. The integrin αvβ5, the unique receptor for vitronectin in HT29-D4 (26Lehmann M. Rabenandrasana C. Tamura R. Lissitzky J.-C. Quaranta V. Pichon J. Marvaldi J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2102-2107PubMed Google Scholar) and in PDX0 and PDX39P cells (not shown), does not require activation to mediate ligand binding. However, the absence of cleavage of α subunits could lead to the suppression of the constitutive integrin activation. We, therefore, assessed whether PMA or the divalent cation Mn2+ could restore a normal attachment of α1-PDX-expressing cells on vitronectin. As illustrated in Fig. 3 B, stimulation of PDX39P cells by PMA failed to restore cell adhesion to vitronectin. Moreover, treatment of cells by 1 mm (Fig. 3 B) or higher concentrations (not shown) of Mn2+ does stimulate cell adhesion, but in the same proportion for all cell types. These data indicate that uncleaved αvβ5 integrin present on PDX39P cells seems to be constitutively active, but it can be further activated by divalent ions as does cleaved integrin. Integrin-mediated cell adhesion may be altered by changes either in affinity of individual receptors for ligand or in integrin avidity (32Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 554-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that integrin interaction with cytoskeletal proteins that serve to anchor and cluster integrins regulates receptor avidity. We therefore used a solid-phase binding assay to test the interaction of the αvβ5 integrins with vitronectin in a cell-free environment. In these conditions, we observed no significant difference of binding between the solubilized αvβ5 integrins from PDX0 and those from PDX39P cells (Fig. 4). The interaction integrin/vitronectin was RGD- and divalent cation-dependent and was enhanced to the same extent in the presence of Mn2+. These results suggest that the reduced adhesion of PDX39P cells to vitronectin was not due to changes in the interaction of the integrins with their ligand. Previous studies on the role of cleavage on integrin function have focused on ligand binding (3Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kolodziej M. Vilaire G. Gonder D. Poncz M. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23499-23504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7293-7296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, cell adhesion to ECM results in the integrin-dependent activation of a number of signaling pathways that can be affected by cleavage. We therefore examined whether α1-PDX-expressing cells were able to elicit intracellular signal transduction events upon αvβ5 integrin ligation. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is one of the earliest events detected in response to cell attachment to an ECM protein-coated surface. Adhesion of PDX0 cells to vitronectin led to a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the molecular mass range of 110–125 kDa and around 70 kDa, whereas no enhanced phosphorylation could be observed with PDX39P cells (data not shown). In most cell types, the FAK accounts for a large proportion of the tyrosine phosphorylation in the 110–125-kDa region. Therefore, PDX0 and PDX39P cells were plated on vitronectin-coated dishes, and the phosphorylation status of FAK was assessed after immunoprecipitation. We observed a time-dependent increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK from PDX0 cells after adhesion on vitronectin (Fig. 5 A). In PDX39P cells in suspension, the FAK phosphorylation level was very low compared with control cells and did not enhance in vitronectin-adherent cells. We repeated the experiment with an antibody against paxillin, a FAK-associated phosphoprotein. As observed with FAK, paxillin from PDX0 cells was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to integrin ligation, while only a very slight phosphorylation could be detected in PDX39P cells (Fig. 5 B). The absence of tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK in PDX39P cells could be due to a defect in the FAK signaling pathway. However, as shown in Fig. 5 C, FAK could still be tyrosine phosphorylated after stimulation of PDX39P cells by neuropeptides, such as neurotensin, or by treatment with the microtubule-disrupting agent nocodazole. Because MAPK cascade is an important signaling pathway activated by integrins, we analyzed MAPK activation in response to cell adhesion using an antibody raised against the dually phosphorylated region within the catalytic core of the active form of ERK1 and ERK2. As illustrated in Fig. 6 A, adhesion of PDX0 cells to vitronectin resulted in the activation of ERK2, while ERK1 was barely activated. In the case of PDX39P, ERKs are already activated in suspended cells and adhesion to vitronectin resulted in an additional increase in activation of ERK2. On the contrary, activation of ERK1 decreases with time of adhesion. A recent report demonstrated that activation of MAPK might suppress the activation of integrins and thus negatively regulate cell adhesion and motility (33Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the reduced attachment of PDX39P cells to vitronectin could be due to the higher activity of MAPK in these cells. We therefore measured cell adhesion when MAPK is activated by epidermal growth factor or, on the contrary, when its activation is impaired by PD98059. As illustrated in Fig.6 B, we observed no difference in cell adhesion (upper panel), whatever the activation status of MAPK (lower panels). Thus, neither impediment of MAPK activation in PDX39P cells, nor activation of MAPK in PDX0 cells had any effect on adhesion to vitronectin (Fig. 6 B). In the present work we have examined the importance of α subunit cleavage for integrin function. We have generated stable transfectants (PDX39P cells) expressing high levels of α1-PDX, a potent and selective inhibitor of convertases and especially of furin and PC5B (14Jean F. Stella K. Thomas L. Liu G. Xiang Y. Reason A. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7293-7298Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The α1-PDX-expressing cells displayed plasma membrane integrins mainly under an uncleaved form, although a minor cleavage could be observed. This result confirms that the convertase family of serine proteases is involved in the post-translational processing of integrins α chains, as we reported previously (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,23Lissitzky J. Luis J. Munzer J. Benjannet S. Parat F. Chrétien M. Marvaldi J. Seidah N. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Endoproteolytic cleavage is often required to generate active proteins from inactive precursors. Here we report that PDX39P cells, which display uncleaved integrins on cell surface, showed a reduced adhesion to vitronectin through the αvβ5 integrin. However, we found no evidence that cleavage of the α subunits has any major effect on cell adhesion to other ECM proteins, such as laminin-1 and collagen type I. This absence of effect is likely due to the involvement of noncleavable β1 integrins, such as α1β1 or α2β1, which support HT29-D4 cell adhesion to these ECM proteins (26Lehmann M. Rabenandrasana C. Tamura R. Lissitzky J.-C. Quaranta V. Pichon J. Marvaldi J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2102-2107PubMed Google Scholar, 28Rigot V. Lehmann M. André F. Daemi N. Marvaldi J. Luis J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3119-3127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We neither observed any difference between cells when using the integrin-independent substrate poly-l-lysine. The reduced adhesion of PDX39P cells to vitronectin was not due to changes in αvβ5 expression, as neither transfection nor PEA selection altered the amount of integrin subunits at the cell surface. For several reasons, abolishing α subunit cleavage neither seems to cause important alterations in integrin structure. (i) α/β association still occurred because heterodimers containing the uncleaved α3, α6, or αv subunits were expressed on the cell surface, as also reported for the furin-deficient cell line LoVo (22Lehmann M. Rigot V. Seidah N.G. Marvaldi J. Lissitzky J.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and mutated αIIb and α4 subunits (3Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,6Kolodziej M. Vilaire G. Gonder D. Poncz M. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23499-23504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (ii) PDX39P cells attached with the same efficiency than parental cells or empty vector transfected cells to two mAbs (69.6.5 and AMF-7) recognizing distinct αv epitopes (not shown). (iii) The function-blocking mAb 69.6.5 inhibited adhesion to vitronectin with similar dose-effect profiles whatever the cell type (not shown). The integrin adhesive function can be regulated by intracellular signals, a phenomenon known as inside-out signaling (reviewed in Refs.34Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2945) Google Scholar and 35Brown E. Hogg N. Immunol. Lett. 1996; 54: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This can be done either by altering the affinity of the individual integrins or by integrin clustering, which allows more efficient interaction and increased binding between cells and ECM. The reduced adhesion of PDX39P cells to vitronectin is most likely not due to changes in integrin affinity, as we noticed no significant difference of interaction between cleaved and uncleaved integrins in a solid-phase receptor assay. This result is in agreement with previous reports showing that the absence of cleavage of the α4and αIIb subunits did not affect ligand binding of the α4β1 and αIIbβ3integrins (3Teixidó J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kolodziej M. Vilaire G. Gonder D. Poncz M. Bennett J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23499-23504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies have no examined the role of integrin cleavage on intracellular signaling pathways. In the present study we show that the phosphorylation level of FAK and its associated phosphoprotein paxillin, in response to ligation of αvβ5 integrin, was very low in α1-PDX-expressing cells. Various signaling proteins have been involved in the inside-out modulation of integrin function. Thus, FAK phosphorylation induced by integrin ligation appears to contribute to stabilization of cell adhesion (36Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O. Gutkind J. Burbelo P. Akiyama S. Yamada K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar). Such a positive feedback loop is also thought to occur in the context of protein kinase C activation during adhesion and spreading (37Chun J.-S. Jacobson B.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It thus can be hypothesized that the absence of cleavage of the αvβ5 integrin leads to the impairment of signal transduction by FAK (or another molecule) upon cell adhesion, that in turn might result in a reduced efficiency of PDX39P cells attachment to vitronectin. In support of this hypothesis, Delwel et al. (7Delwel G.O. Hogervorst F. Sonnenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7293-7296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) have shown that the cleavage of the α6A subunit is essential for activation of the integrin by the phorbol ester PMA, a protein kinase C activator. MAPKs (ERK1 and ERK2) are activated in response to a variety of extracellular signals and thus represent a convergence point for many signaling pathways. It is now clear that integrin-mediated cell adhesion can also lead to the activation of the MAPK cascade (for review, see Ref. 1Aplin A. Howe A. Alahari S. Juliano R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 197-263PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we show that ERK2 and, to a lesser extent, ERK1 are activated upon interaction of the αvβ5 integrin with vitronectin. We also reported that ERK2 was already activated in PDX39P cells kept in suspension and that the enzyme was further activated during adhesion. There is increasing evidence that suppression of integrin activation may be a physiological mechanism to control integrin-dependent cell adhesion and migration. The existence of signaling pathways acting as inhibitors of integrin activation has been proposed, and recently Ras/Raf-1-initiated activation of MAPK pathway has been shown to suppress the activation of β1 and β3 integrins (33Hughes P. Renshaw M. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V. Schwartz M. Ginsberg M. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Thus, one possibility is that the reduced adhesion of PDX39P cells to vitronectin was the result of the high activity level of MAPK in these cells. However, this is likely not the case, because neither MAPK activation nor impediment of MAPK activation had any effect on adhesion to vitronectin. An alternative is the suppression of the constitutive integrin activation due to the absence of α subunits cleavage. Nevertheless, the integrin αvβ5 was already present as an active form in α1-PDX-expressing cells, as neither PMA nor the divalent cation Mn2+, two integrin activators, could restore a normal attachment of α1-PDX-expressing cells on vitronectin. It thus appears that the absence of endoproteolytic cleavage of the αv subunit affects integrin function by altering αvβ5-dependent signaling pathways. The molecular mechanism responsible of this dysfunction remains to be determined. We are grateful to M. Lehmann for the critical reading of the manuscript; to J.-C. Lissitzky for providing laminin-1; and to F. Parat, F. Giannellini, and P. Bremond for their expert technical assistance."

Meredith D.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1992; 73: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The precise role of VP22 in the herpes simplex virus type 1 infection process is not presently understood, although it has been shown that the protein is modified by phosphorylation (2Elliott G. O'Reilly D. O'Hare P. Virology. 1996; 226: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and induces bundling of cytoskeletal microtubules (3Elliott G. O'Hare P. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6448-6455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The property that has stimulated the most interest in the protein, however, is the unique transport activity demonstrated in initial function studies (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). In transfection assays, the protein was observed in unusually high numbers of cells (up to 100% of the population). Further analysis indicated that this activity was due to spread of the protein from the subpopulation of cells in which it was actively synthesized, where it localized in the cytoplasm in a filamentous pattern, to surrounding cells, where it accumulated in the nucleus and could be observed binding to chromatin (Fig. 1). VP22 does not contain a conventional signal sequence, and spread appeared to be via a Golgi-independent mechanism. Uptake in the surrounding cells did not involve classical endocytosis (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar), and the nuclear import occurred in the absence of a conventional nuclear localization sequence (although portions of the protein's sequence are highly basic). Thus, VP22 joins a small but growing group of proteins that utilize nonclassical secretory mechanisms to traverse lipid bilayers (5Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Kuchler K. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Man. R. G. Landes Bioscience, Austin, TX1997: 87-114Google Scholar), including acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-1)1 (6Jackson A. Friedman S. Zhan X.

Peptide Res. 2000; 55: 163-172Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and the HIV-1 Tat protein (11Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). These proteins are secreted or taken up by cells in the absence of conventional signal sequences, without a clear explanation for the underlying structural mechanisms involved. It has been postulated that this nonclassical export utilizes an ATP-driven protein transporter (12Kuchler K. Throner J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Another explanation for these transport processes involves the adoption of a molten globule-like state by the proteins. In a molten globule state, there is a substantial loss of tertiary structure content with retention of the majority of the secondary structure present in the native protein. This state has been induced in select proteins under conditions of low pH, high salt content, and elevated temperature (13Bychkova V.E. Berni R. Rossi G.L. Kutyshenko V.P. Ptitsyn O.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7566-7571Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 14Mach H. Ryan J.A. Burke C.J. Volkin D.B. Middaugh C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7703-7711Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and has been shown to be an intermediary in some protein folding pathways (15Barrick D. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been postulated that the molten globule state may play an important role in the insertion and translocation of proteins across lipid bilayers (17Bychkova V.E. Pain R.H. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1988; 238: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A conformational change into a molten globule-like state may allow the hydrophobic core of the protein to interact with and partially insert into the lipid bilayer. Molten globule-lipid interactions have been reported for a number of proteins (18van der Goot F.G. Gonzalez-Manas J.M. Lakey J.H. Pattus F. Nature. 1991; 354: 408-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar, 19Soulages J. Bendavid O.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10203-10210Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Mach H.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4296-4302Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); this type of process could eliminate the need for a signal sequence. Additionally, the interaction may be aided by initial electrostatic attraction between these proteins, which are often highly basic, and cell surface polyanions such as the proteoglycans. However, the presence and possible role of a molten globule state in the mechanism of VP22 transport has yet to be established. The efficiency of transport, as well as the lack of reliance on conventional cell transport mechanisms, makes VP22 an intriguing candidate for macromolecular drug delivery. Studies have shown that various target proteins including green fluorescent protein (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 22Elliott G. O'Hare P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 149-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (23Dilber M.S. Phelan A. Aints A. Mohamed A.J. Elliott G. Edvard Smith C.I. O'Hare P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and p53 (24Phelan A. Elliott G. O'Hare P. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 440-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) can be linked to either the N or C terminus of VP22, with the chimeric proteins retaining both the function of the target protein and the transport activity of VP22. Such experiments have been successfully conducted in multiple cell lines (e.g. COS-1, BHK-21, HeLa, Vero (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar)), in which spread of the protein occurs both within and between individual cell types. VP22 uptake from cell media has also been observed (4Elliott G. O'Hare P. Cell. 1997; 88: 223-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Therefore, intercellular transport can be considered an intrinsic property of the protein itself, not the experimental system, encouraging the exploration of the protein as a drug delivery vehicle. To this effect, VP22 has been successfully used in both in vitro and in vivo suicide gene therapy experiments (23Dilber M.S. Phelan A. Aints A. Mohamed A.J. Elliott G. Edvard Smith C.I. O'Hare P. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In this work, we initiate investigations of the unusual transport properties of VP22, focusing on its underlying structural characteristics. Utilizing VP22.C1, a truncated version of VP22 consisting of the C-terminal half that retains the transport activities of the native protein, we provide the first structural analysis of the protein. We establish the spectroscopic profile of VP22.C1 utilizing UV absorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The structural properties of the protein in solution in both the native and temperature perturbed state are examined. Additionally, we describe a complex series of conformational transitions observed in VP22.C1 in the range of 20–60 °C that results in a post-transition state of the protein that retains a significant amount of secondary structure. The interaction of the protein with metal cations, model polyanions, and model lipids is also described, and possible mechanisms of VP22 transport are discussed. All errors are reported as S.E. Phosphorothiolate oligonucleotides (5′-CCC CCA CCA CTT CCC CTC TC-3′) were synthesized by Genset.trans-Parinaric acids were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). High molecular weight heparin (M r 12,000–20,000) was purchased from Sigma. Dialysis materials were obtained from Pierce. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis buffers, stains, precast gels, and other reagents were obtained from Novex. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma and Fisher. The bacterial expression construct pVP24 contains VP22 residues 159–301 in the background of the commercial vector pEt24b and was grown in the Escherichia coli strain (BL21pLysS). In this construct, the VP22 sequences are flanked at the N terminus by an extra 16 residues comprising the T7 epitope tag from the vector and at the C terminus by 6 histidine residues to facilitate purification by nickel chelating chromatography. Cultures were grown overnight in L Broth plus kanamycin and chloramphenicol, diluted the next morning by 1:10, and incubated at 37 °C until the A 600 had reached ∼0.4. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was then added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and incubation continued for a further 4 h. The cultures were cooled on ice and centrifuged at 6,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellets were frozen and stored at −20 °C overnight. Thawed pellets were then resuspended in ∼30 ml of cold “lysis buffer,” lysozyme was added to 1 mg/ml, and the sample was incubated for 30 min on ice with occasional shaking. Lysis was completed by sonication (three 10-s bursts on ice). Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.1% followed by DNase I and RNase to 10 μg/ml, and the sample was incubated on ice for a further 20 min with occasional mixing. The lysate was then drawn through a 21-gauge needle using a 60-ml syringe three times and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was added to 3.5 ml of DEAE-agarose (50% slurry equilibrated in lysis buffer) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C, rotating throughout. The agarose was pelleted (3,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min), and the unbound supernatant was added to a column of ∼5-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (50% slurry equilibrated in lysis buffer plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40). The unbound fraction was collected, and the column was washed at 12 ml/h with “wash buffer.” VP22.C1 was then eluted in 20 ml employing a 40–500 mmimidazole gradient. One-ml fractions were collected, frozen, and stored at −70 °C, with VP22 eluting at around 180 mmimidazole. The lysis buffer consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin and apoprotinin (alternatively, Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets, Complete™ EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used at 1× concentration). The wash buffer was prepared as the lysis buffer with 10% glycerol and 40 mm imidazole. The elution buffer was prepared as lysis buffer with 10% glycerol and 500 mm imidazole. The protein was then further purified by cation exchange chromatography (Mono S®; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Samples from the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid purification were diluted 1:3 in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, applied to a Mono S HR5/5 column equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl, and eluted with a salt gradient (100 mm to 1 m NaCl in 15 ml). VP22.C1 eluted at approximately 250 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were divided into aliquots where necessary and stored at −70 °C. Buffer A contained 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and apoprotinin (alternatively, Protease Inhibitor Mixture tablets, Complete™ EDTA-free (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used at 0.1× concentration) and 10% glycerol. Buffer B was prepared as buffer A with 1 m NaCl. Cells were grown on coverslips in six-well dishes in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 10% newborn calf serum (NCS). Prior to the import assay (1 h), the medium was changed, and the cells were incubated with 1 ml of fresh Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium containing 1% NCS. Aliquots of VP22.C1 (200 ng) as indicated (clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min) were added to prewarmed medium containing 1% NCS with a final volume of 1 ml. The medium was then aspirated from the cell cultures and replaced with the medium containing protein, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed gently with PBS and fixed in methanol at room temperature for 15 min. The coverslips were then blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% NCS and probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (AGV600 1:100) directed against a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing the C-terminal residues 257–301 of VP22. The secondary antibody was fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum. Protein samples were stored at −80 °C in the original elution buffer until used. Solutions of VP22.C1 were dialyzed against 10 mm phosphate containing 200 mm NaCl at pH 7.4. Metal cation interaction studies were conducted in 10 mm MOPS, 200 mm NaCl, at pH 7.4. The presence of a high salt concentration was necessary to prevent protein precipitation. Buffer exchange was conducted at 4 °C using Pierce Slide-A-Lyzer® MINI-Dialysis units (cellulose membrane; molecular weight cut-off, 7,000), with a buffer to sample ratio of 10,000:1 (v/v), over a period of 6 h. In some cases, solutions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 60 s to remove trace quantities of aggregated protein prior to concentration determinations and subsequent experimental procedures. Protein concentrations were determined at room temperature by UV absorbance measurement at 280 nm (ε = 11,214, calculated (25Mach H. Volkin D.B. Burke C.J. Middaugh C.R. Shirley B.A. Protein Stability and Folding: Theory and Practice. 40. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1995: 91-114Google Scholar)) on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-visible spectrophotometer fitted with a Peltier temperature controller. Temperature perturbation studies were conducted at a protein concentration of 180 μg/ml, with a 5-min equilibration time included before collection of each spectrum. Spectral analysis was conducted using UV-visible Chemstation software (Hewlett-Packard). Fourth derivative spectra were calculated employing a nine-point data filter and fifth degree Savitzky-Golay polynomial and subsequently fitted to a cubic function, with 99 interpolated points per raw data point, permitting 0.01-nm resolution. Peak positions were then determined from the interpolated curves. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. Far UV spectra (between 198 and 290 nm) were collected using a 1-mm path length cuvette, sealed with a Teflon stopper. A resolution of 0.1 nm and scanning speed of 10 nm/min with a 2-s response time were employed. Spectra presented are an average of three consecutive spectra. In some cases, spectra were recorded at 10 °C intervals employing a thermostated cuvette holder. Equilibration times of 5 min were included at each temperature interval. Alternatively, the molar ellipticity ([θ]m) at 215 nm was collected at 0.1 °C intervals, using a 15 °C/h temperature ramp rate. The reversibility of observed transitions was evaluated by monitoring the return of heated samples to the original (low temperature) CD spectrum. A protein concentration of 240 μg/ml was employed in all studies. Noise reduction and data analysis was performed using Standard Analysis and Temperature/Wavelength Analysis programs (Jasco) and MicroCal OriginTM 5.0 software. Midpoints of temperature curves were determined by derivative analysis. Secondary structure content was estimated using the CONTIN (26Provencher S. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar), SELCON (27Sreerama N. Woody R. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 209: 32-44Crossref Scopus (946) Google Scholar), and Neural Network (28Andrade M.A. Chacoin P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar) analysis programs provided with the SoftSecTM conversion program (Softwood). DSC thermograms were collected with a Calorimetry Sciences Nano-DSC calorimeter. Scans were obtained over consecutive heating and cooling cycles, between 0 and 100 °C under 3 atmospheres of pressure. A temperature scanning rate of 1 °C/min was used in all cases. An equilibration time of 10 min was included at the beginning and end of each cycle. Sample and reference buffers were degassed prior to use, and a protein concentration of 600 μg/ml was employed. A buffer base line was subtracted from each scan, and the data were converted to molar heat capacity. The excess molar heat capacity was then deconvoluted with CpCalc (Applied Thermodynamics, Inc.) and MicroCal OriginTM5.0 software to analyze the underlying components. FTIR spectra were collected on a Nicolet Magna-IR 560ESP spectrophotometer fitted with an MCT detector and continuous dry air purge. Dry protein samples were analyzed by placing 25 μl of a 1 mg/ml solution on polyethylene cards and drying under vacuum for 1 h. Spectra were recorded at room temperature, with a resolution of 4 cm−1, and 256 consecutive scans were collected for each sample. Buffer and card spectra were then subtracted. Solution studies were performed using a 5.3-μm path length transmission cell (BioCellTM, Biotools, Inc.). Ten microliters of a 4.5 mg/ml protein solution were used for each sample. Collection parameters were as above. Buffer spectra were collected following each protein spectra, using the water association band at 2300 cm−1 as a reference for path length matching, and were then subtracted from the protein spectra. Subtractions, smoothing, and Fourier self-deconvolution of the amide I band of all protein samples were performed using Omnic software (Nicolet). Fourier self-deconvolution bandwidth and enhancement parameters were 21 and 2.5, respectively. Final deconvolution into underlying components was performed with Galactic Peaksolve, using the Fourier self-deconvolution trace and second derivative spectra as guides for initial parameters and a mixed Gaussian-Lorentzian peak shape. Steady state fluorescence emission spectra were recorded using a PTI QuantaMaster spectrophotometer with a thermostated cuvette holder. The intrinsic fluorescence spectrum of tryptophan was monitored, using an excitation wavelength of 280 nm, an emission range of 300–450 nm, and a data collection rate of 1 nm/s. For thermal perturbation studies, excitation and emission slits were set at 3 and 2 nm, respectively. The protein concentration employed was 60 μg/ml, and a 1-cm path length cuvette with a Teflon cap was used in all experiments. Temperature control was measured directly from the thermostated holder. A 10-min equilibration time at each temperature point was used, during which the sample was stirred continuously. Studies of cation and polyanion interactions employed excitation and emission slits set at 3 nm. Protein concentration was 35 μg/ml, and a 1-cm path length cuvette was employed. For all experiments, data were corrected internally for lamp fluctuations and the wavelength dependence of intensity. Tryptophan peak positions were determined by first derivative analysis. Midpoints of thermal transitions were determined by fits to model sigmoidal functions. Data analysis was performed using Felix (PTI) and MicroCal OriginTM 5.0 software. VP22.C1 and parinaric acid binding experiments were performed using a protocol adapted from Sklar and Hudson (29Sklar L.A. Hudson B.S. J. Supramol. Struct. 1976; 4: 449-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To prevent probe degradation (oxidation) due to light and atmosphere exposure, all trans-parinaric acid (trans-PA) solutions were stored in light protective containers under nitrogen. For long term storage, trans-PA solutions were stored at −20 °C. To minimize trans-PA degradation, 25 μg/ml solutions of VP22.C1 solutions were placed in a 1-cm path length sealed cuvette under nitrogen atmosphere. Equivolume (4- or 8-μl) additions of trans-PA in EtOH were then made to the protein solution through a self-sealing septum. The solutions were stirred continuously for a 5-min equilibration period, andtrans-PA emission spectra were then recorded from 350 to 500 nm, with excitation at 314 nm to minimize contribution of tryptophan emission. Excitation and emission slits were set at 3 and 10 nm, respectively. Temperature was maintained constant over the course of each titration using a Peltier temperature control unit cooled with a circulating water pump with temperature measured directly from the thermostated cuvette holder. Titrations were conducted at temperatures ranging from 20 to 60 °C. Total trans-PA concentrations ranged from 0 to 3.9 μm, corresponding to [trans-PA] to [VP22.C1] ratios of 0:1 to 3:1 in each experiment. Concentration of trans-PA in EtOH was calculated by UV absorbance at 298 nm (ε = 85,000) (30Haugland R. Handbook of Fluorescent Probes and Research Chemicals. 6th Ed. Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR1996: 297-300Google Scholar). Total dilution of protein solutions was <5% during each titration. Total EtOH was kept to less than 4% of total volume. Total and exposed free sulfhydryl content of the protein was determined using a modification of the protocol previously developed by Habeeb (31Habeeb A.F.S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 25: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). To measure total free sulfhydryl content, protein samples were denatured in 2% SDS at 60 °C for 40 min. DTNB was added in 50-fold excess, and absorbance at 412 nm was collected for 30 min. The concentration of free sulfhydryl residues was then calculated using ε = 13,600 at 412 nm. The degree of exposure of the free sulfhydryl residues was estimated by similar means, in the absence of SDS and denaturing conditions. Protein concentration was 90 μg/ml for all experiments. Molecular weight of protein in solution was determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel electrophoresis, using the Novex NuPageTM system. Protein samples were separated in 4–12% bis-tris polyacrylamide or 10–20% Tris-glycine gels in the presence of SDS, under both reduced and nonreduced conditions. Protein bands were detected using Coomassie Blue staining. Analysis of purified VP22.C1 by nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicates the presence of a single band corresponding to the monomeric protein (18.5 kDa) accompanied by a band of varying intensity at a dimeric position. The intensity of the dimer band is low, consisting of approximately 5% of the total protein. However, for one protein preparation the dimer does account for approximately 30% of the total protein, which may be the result of uncontrollable variations in dialysis conditions (results not illustrated). The presence of reducing agents (10 mm dithiothreitol) converts the dimer band completely to monomer, consistent with the presence of a disulfide-linked dimer. Analysis of the exposure of the protein's two cysteine residues employing DTNB finds ∼0.7 free sulfhydryl groups under both native and unfolding conditions for analysis of the sample with high dimer percentage. This variability between protein preparations further supports the possibility of a small amount of disulfide-linked dimer present in the sample material. All of the following studies were performed with this material. Results of immunofluorescence studies (Fig.1) show that VP22.C1 can be detected in cells after application in media, exhibiting pronounced accumulation in the nucleus although a significant fraction of the protein can be observed in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that purified VP22.C1 retains the import property, which has been previously shown only with crude preparations of native VP22. No data currently exist on the structure of VP22. We therefore examined VP22.C1 with a variety of spectroscopic techniques to gain some insight into its native structure. The UV absorbance spectrum at room temperature (Fig.2) exhibits a maximum at 284.0 nm with a distinct shoulder at 291.2 nm, indicative of the presence of tryptophan but no tyrosine residues, which is consistent with the known amino acid sequence. The fluorescence emission spectrum of VP22.C1 (Fig. 2) consists of a broad peak near 330 nm, suggesting that both tryptophan residues are only partially solvent-exposed under neutral solution conditions. The far UV CD spectrum of the protein at room temperature exhibits strong negative ellipticity at 206 and 223 nm, suggesting a significant α-helix content (Fig. 3 a). Secondary structure analysis of VP22.C1 by CONTIN, SELCON, and a Neural Network prediction program indicate that under these conditions at physiological pH (pH 7.4), the protein consists of 30 ± 3% α-helix, 17 ± 3% β-sheet, and 51 ± 1% random and/or turn structure (n = 16). The amount of β-turn structure was predicted to be ∼25% by the SELCON program. Additional secondary structure information was obtained by solution FTIR spectroscopy. The amide I spectrum of VP22.C1 was deconvoluted into underlying components based on initial Fourier self-deconvolution of the zero-order spectrum and second derivative analysis (Fig.3 b). The resulting peaks were then assigned to secondary structure elements using the assignments of Susi and Byler (32Susi H. Byler D.M. Methods Enzmol. 1986; 130: 291-311Google Scholar). Based on this approach, 32 ± 1% α-helix, 39 ± 2% β-sheet, 14 ± 1% β-turn, and 15 ± 2% disordered structure (n = 6) were predicted. Additional analysis of the protein by FTIR was performed with 1.2 mg/ml solutions dried on polyethylene cards. Secondary structure of the dried protein was estimated to be 40 ± 3% α-helix, 32 ± 1% β-sheet, 14 ± 1% turn, and 15 ± 3% disordered structure (n = 6) based on this method. Although of relatively small size, the 159–301 fragment of VP22 appears to possess significant conformational lability."

Gottschalk G. Drake H. Acetogenesis. Chapman and Hall, New York1994: 127-156Crossref Google Scholar). The sodium ion potential is established by a not yet identified primary pump connected to the acetyl-CoA pathway (2Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. J.

The transmembrane electrochemical Na+ gradient established is used as the driving force for flagellar rotation as well as ATP synthesis (3Heise R. Müller V. Gottschalk G. FEMS Microbiol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The atp operon encoding the Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii was recently cloned, sequenced, and shown to consist of the genes atpI, atpB,atpE 1, atpE 2,atpE 3, atpF,atpH, atpA, atpG, atpD, and atpC. The finding of multiple copies of genes (atpE 1, atpE 2,atpE 3) encoding subunit c homologues (the so called proteolipids) is without precedence in any bacterial species. Subunits AtpE2 (c 2) and AtpE3 (c 3) are identical on the amino acid level. Their deduced molecular mass is 8.18 kDa, and they are predicted to be organized in the membrane as a hair pin connected by a polar loop (13Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Each hair pin contains an ion-binding site (10Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,14Assadi-Porter F.M. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16186-16193Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). AtpE1 (c 1) most likely arose by duplication of an ancestral gene and subsequent fusion of the gene copies. Subunit c 1 is predicted to have four transmembrane helices, but the ion binding motif is conserved only in hair pin one, but not two. Therefore, subunitc 1 of A. woodii is similar to the so-called 16-kDa proteolipids of V1V0-ATPases, which also arose by gene duplication accompanied by loss of the proton-binding residue in hair pin one. The loss of the proton-binding residue was believed to be the reason for the apparent inability of V1V0-ATPases to function as ATP synthases underin vivo conditions (16Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Western blot analyses verified thatatpE 1 was expressed and that the product was not posttranslationally split into two 8-kDa proteolipids (11Rahlfs S. Aufurth S. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33999-34004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, AtpE1 was not found in the enzyme purified previously (6Reidlinger J. Müller V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii purified previously not only lacked subunitc 1 but also the gene products AtpB (subunita) and AtpF (subunit b). Subunits aand b were also not present in the ATPase of Moorella thermoacetica, although the encoding genes were present. These findings led to the hypothesis that atpB and atpFare transcribed, but the messages are not translated (17Das A. Ivey D.M. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding of the genes atpE 1, atpB, andatpF in the F1F0-ATPase operon ofA. woodii raised the question whether subunitsc 1, a, and b are true subunits of the F1F0-ATP synthase of A. woodii. We demonstrate here that the genes encoding subunits a and b of A. woodii are expressed and that subunits a, b, andc 1 are assembled into the ATPase complex. This is the first demonstration of an F1F0-ATPase containing a hetero-oligomer of subunit c consisting of both 8- and 16-kDa proteolipids.DISCUSSIONWe have now isolated the Na+-F1F0-ATPase in its native state and found nine polypeptides. These were identified by N-terminal sequencing and immunological methods as subunits a,c 1, c 2/3, b, δ, α, γ, β, and ε. The N-terminal sequences now available allow us to identify unequivocally the start codons of the respective genes. With the exception of atpF, the experimentally determined start codons match the ones deduced from the DNA sequences. The start codon of atpF is actually 45 nucleotides downstream from the previously assumed start site (12Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Translation ofatpF starts with the unusual start codon TTG; the same is true for atpA (11Rahlfs S. Aufurth S. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33999-34004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). N-formylated N-terminal methionines were found in subunits a, b, andc 2/3, whereas subunit α has a deformylated methionine. The N-terminal methionine was removed from subunits β, γ, δ, and ε. Removal of the first methionine was also reported for subunits β, γ, and ε of the E. coli enzyme (27Walker J.E. Gay N.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and for subunits γ and ε of the P. modestum enzyme (26Gerike U. Dimroth P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).ATPase preparations from A. woodii described previously lacked subunits a and b. The same was observed inM. thermoacetica and Moorella thermoautotrophica, although the encoding genes were present in the atp operons (17Das A. Ivey D.M. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). atpB and atpF of M. thermoacetica were transcribed, but because antisera against synthetic polypeptides derived from the sequences of subunita and b of M. thermoacetica did not cross-react with cell free extract (18Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was concluded that the messages are not translated. From the findings presented here it is clear that in A. woodii subunits a andb are produced. By using the gentle blue native-PAGE procedure, we were able to isolate the ATPase complex in its native state. Therefore, we have to conclude that subunits aand b were lost in the course of the purification procedure employed in a previous study. Even with the use of blue native-PAGE, subunit a was not detectable in every preparation.Another striking and unique feature of the Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii is its duplicated proteolipid, subunitc 1. This is without precedence in bacteria. Duplicated proteolipids were, for a long time, seen as an exclusive feature of eucaryal V1V0-ATPases (28Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In archaea, duplication and triplication of proteolipid-encoding genes with subsequent fusion of the genes was described very recently (16Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,29Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the experiments described here we add another argument, now derived from a bacterial species, that multiplied and fused proteolipid-encoding genes are not exclusively present in eucarya, but also in the other domains of life. From the experiments described here it is clear that subunits c 2/3 andc 1 constitute the c-oligomer. Although the stoichiometry of the individual polypeptides of the oligomer is unknown, it appears from the Western blots and SDS-PAGEs that subunit c 1 is only a minor component. In this connection it should be mentioned that the migration behavior of the c-oligomer is dependent on the acrylamide concentration. In 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the c-oligomer runs at 43 kDa, but in 16% gels, it runs at 61 kDa. Therefore, we cannot speculate about the number of monomers in the complex.Subunit c 1 is not only duplicated, but Glu-162 in hair pin two is also substituted by a glutamine residue. The glutamate is part of the proposed sodium ion-binding site (Pro-Gln-Glu-Thr) (10Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in subunit c. Although the free electron pair of the amino group of Gln-162 could in principal bind the sodium ion (as does Gln-46 in helix one and Gln-129 in helix three), the substitution might have consequences for the rotation of the motor of the ATPase. Current views on the function of the motor assume an electrostatic attraction of Na+ (H+) by Glu (Asp) (31Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 32Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Due to the neutralization of the charge of Glu (Glu-62 in c 2/3 and Glu-79 inc 1) after coordinating a sodium ion, thec-ring may cross the electric barrier and rotate into the hydrophobic zone, driven by the electrostatic interaction of a highly conserved Arg (Arg-158 in A. woodii) in subunit awith another free Glu on the next monomer of the c-ring. This would lead to a rotation of the c-ring relative to subunits a and b. The lesser the number of carboxylates per ring, the worse is the coupling efficiency. In the worst case, the V1V0-ATPases, ATP synthesis (under physiological conditions) is abolished, but proton pumping capacity is increased. For the F1F0-ATPase of E. coli it was demonstrated that the ATPase can tolerate the exchange of one Asp-61 with an Asn residue without losing its capability to translocate H+ (33Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ATPase fromMethanococcus jannaschii contains a triplicated proteolipid with only two proton-translocating groups, but this enzyme still functions as an ATP synthase. In view of this discussion, the determination of the exact stoichiometry of the subunits of the c-oligomer of A. woodii is essential; this remains a challenging task for the future.What could be the function of the two different proteolipids in the ATPase of A. woodii? Although it is hard to speculate at present, an attractive idea is the regulation of the function of the enzyme by the relative stoichiometry of c 2/3 andc 1. As pointed out above, the higher the ratio of c 2/3 over c 1, the better the enzyme functions as an ATP synthase, whereas a highc 1:c 2/3 ratio favors pump activity. During growth on fermentable substrates such as sugars, the enzyme may function as an ATP-driven ion pump used to regulate intracellular pH and/or Na+ concentration, whereas during growth on H2 + CO2 the enzyme has to drive ATP synthesis by means of the electrochemical Na+ potential across the membrane. Regulation of the coupling efficiency in ATPases by varying the number of c-subunits per oligomer was originally suggested by Brusilow and co-workers (34Schemidt R.A. Qu J. Williams J.R. Brusilow W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verification of this interesting idea remains a challenging task for future experiments. Acetobacterium woodii is a strictly anaerobic, homoacetogenic bacterium that relies on a sodium ion potential across its cytoplasmic membrane for energy-dependent reactions (1Müller V. Gottschalk G.

These were identified by N-terminal sequencing and immunological methods as subunits a,c 1, c 2/3, b, δ, α, γ, β, and ε. The N-terminal sequences now available allow us to identify unequivocally the start codons of the respective genes. With the exception of atpF, the experimentally determined start codons match the ones deduced from the DNA sequences. The start codon of atpF is actually 45 nucleotides downstream from the previously assumed start site (12Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 35-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Translation ofatpF starts with the unusual start codon TTG; the same is true for atpA (11Rahlfs S. Aufurth S. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33999-34004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). N-formylated N-terminal methionines were found in subunits a, b, andc 2/3, whereas subunit α has a deformylated methionine. The N-terminal methionine was removed from subunits β, γ, δ, and ε. Removal of the first methionine was also reported for subunits β, γ, and ε of the E. coli enzyme (27Walker J.E. Gay N.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 97: 195-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) and for subunits γ and ε of the P. modestum enzyme (26Gerike U. Dimroth P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).ATPase preparations from A. woodii described previously lacked subunits a and b. The same was observed inM. thermoacetica and Moorella thermoautotrophica, although the encoding genes were present in the atp operons (17Das A. Ivey D.M. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1714-1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). atpB and atpF of M. thermoacetica were transcribed, but because antisera against synthetic polypeptides derived from the sequences of subunita and b of M. thermoacetica did not cross-react with cell free extract (18Das A. Ljungdahl L.G. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3746-3755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was concluded that the messages are not translated. From the findings presented here it is clear that in A. woodii subunits a andb are produced. By using the gentle blue native-PAGE procedure, we were able to isolate the ATPase complex in its native state. Therefore, we have to conclude that subunits aand b were lost in the course of the purification procedure employed in a previous study. Even with the use of blue native-PAGE, subunit a was not detectable in every preparation.Another striking and unique feature of the Na+-F1F0-ATPase of A. woodii is its duplicated proteolipid, subunitc 1. This is without precedence in bacteria. Duplicated proteolipids were, for a long time, seen as an exclusive feature of eucaryal V1V0-ATPases (28Nelson N. Taiz L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In archaea, duplication and triplication of proteolipid-encoding genes with subsequent fusion of the genes was described very recently (16Ruppert C. Kavermann H. Wimmers S. Schmid R. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Huber H. Stetter K.O. Müller V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25281-25284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar,29Müller V. Ruppert C. Lemker T. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1999; 31: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). With the experiments described here we add another argument, now derived from a bacterial species, that multiplied and fused proteolipid-encoding genes are not exclusively present in eucarya, but also in the other domains of life. From the experiments described here it is clear that subunits c 2/3 andc 1 constitute the c-oligomer. Although the stoichiometry of the individual polypeptides of the oligomer is unknown, it appears from the Western blots and SDS-PAGEs that subunit c 1 is only a minor component. In this connection it should be mentioned that the migration behavior of the c-oligomer is dependent on the acrylamide concentration. In 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, the c-oligomer runs at 43 kDa, but in 16% gels, it runs at 61 kDa. Therefore, we cannot speculate about the number of monomers in the complex.Subunit c 1 is not only duplicated, but Glu-162 in hair pin two is also substituted by a glutamine residue. The glutamate is part of the proposed sodium ion-binding site (Pro-Gln-Glu-Thr) (10Rahlfs S. Müller V. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Kaim G. Wehrle F. Gerike U. Dimroth P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9185-9194Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 30Zhang Y. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 87-93Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in subunit c. Although the free electron pair of the amino group of Gln-162 could in principal bind the sodium ion (as does Gln-46 in helix one and Gln-129 in helix three), the substitution might have consequences for the rotation of the motor of the ATPase. Current views on the function of the motor assume an electrostatic attraction of Na+ (H+) by Glu (Asp) (31Elston T. Wang H. Oster G. Nature. 1998; 391: 510-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 32Dimroth P. Wang H. Grabe M. Oster G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Due to the neutralization of the charge of Glu (Glu-62 in c 2/3 and Glu-79 inc 1) after coordinating a sodium ion, thec-ring may cross the electric barrier and rotate into the hydrophobic zone, driven by the electrostatic interaction of a highly conserved Arg (Arg-158 in A. woodii) in subunit awith another free Glu on the next monomer of the c-ring. This would lead to a rotation of the c-ring relative to subunits a and b. The lesser the number of carboxylates per ring, the worse is the coupling efficiency. In the worst case, the V1V0-ATPases, ATP synthesis (under physiological conditions) is abolished, but proton pumping capacity is increased. For the F1F0-ATPase of E. coli it was demonstrated that the ATPase can tolerate the exchange of one Asp-61 with an Asn residue without losing its capability to translocate H+ (33Dmitriev O.Y. Altendorf K. Fillingame R.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 478-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ATPase fromMethanococcus jannaschii contains a triplicated proteolipid with only two proton-translocating groups, but this enzyme still functions as an ATP synthase. In view of this discussion, the determination of the exact stoichiometry of the subunits of the c-oligomer of A. woodii is essential; this remains a challenging task for the future.What could be the function of the two different proteolipids in the ATPase of A. woodii? Although it is hard to speculate at present, an attractive idea is the regulation of the function of the enzyme by the relative stoichiometry of c 2/3 andc 1. As pointed out above, the higher the ratio of c 2/3 over c 1, the better the enzyme functions as an ATP synthase, whereas a highc 1:c 2/3 ratio favors pump activity. During growth on fermentable substrates such as sugars, the enzyme may function as an ATP-driven ion pump used to regulate intracellular pH and/or Na+ concentration, whereas during growth on H2 + CO2 the enzyme has to drive ATP synthesis by means of the electrochemical Na+ potential across the membrane. Regulation of the coupling efficiency in ATPases by varying the number of c-subunits per oligomer was originally suggested by Brusilow and co-workers (34Schemidt R.A. Qu J. Williams J.R. Brusilow W.S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 3205-3208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verification of this interesting idea remains a challenging task for future experiments.

Novel types of double-headed inhibitors directed to different tumor-associated proteolytic systems were generated by substitution of a loop in chicken cystatin, which is nonessential for cysteine protease inhibition, with uPA-derived peptides covering the human uPA receptor binding sequence uPA-(19–31). The inhibition constants of these hybrids toward cysteine proteases are similar to those of wild-type cystatin (K i, papain (pm), 1.9–2.4;K i, cathepsin B (nm), 1.0–1.7;K i, cathepsin L (pm), 0.12–0.61). FACS analyses revealed that the hybrids compete for binding of uPA to the cell surface-associated uPA receptor (uPAR) expressed on human U937 cells. The simultaneous interaction of the hybrid molecules with papain and uPAR was analyzed by surface plasmon resonance. The measured K D value of a papain-bound cystatin variant harboring the uPAR binding sequence of uPA (chCys-uPA-(19–31)) and soluble uPAR was 17 nm (K D value for uPA/uPAR interaction, 5 nm). These results indicate that cystatins with a uPAR binding site are efficient inhibitors of cysteine proteases and uPA/uPAR interaction at the same time.

Such a migration/invasion process depends on the concerted action of various proteolytic systems (1DeClerck Y.A. Imren S. Montgomery A.M. Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Laug W.E. Adv. Exp. Med.

Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar) allowing the tumor cells to detach from the extracellular matrix and to degrade the surrounding tissue and tumor stroma. A major proteolytic system involved in these processes is the plasminogen activation system, with components like the serine protease plasmin, its activator urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA),1 the cell surface-associated uPA receptor uPAR (CD 87), and the two inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2 (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar, 3Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). The zymogen of uPA, pro-uPA, is activated by different proteases such as serine (e.g. plasmin, kallikrein) and cysteine proteases (e.g. cathepsin B or L). Via uPA/uPAR interaction, the proteolytic activity of the uPA system is focused on the tumor cell surface, inducing signal transduction, cell proliferation, chemotaxis, and cell migration (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schmitt M. Wilhelm O.G. Reuning U. Krüger A. Harbeck N. Lengyel E. Graeff H.

Cell surface-bound uPA efficiently activates plasminogen to plasmin, which not only degrades components of the extracellular matrix but also converts pro-uPA to uPA as well as some of the pro-forms of matrix metalloproteases to active matrix metalloproteases (1DeClerck Y.A.

The cysteine proteases cathepsin B and L are essential for intracellular protein degradation in the lysosomes (5Turk B. Turk D. Turk V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 98-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). In tumor cells, in addition to their intracellular localization, cathepsin B and L are located at the tumor cell surface and may activate pro-uPA to uPA and degrade extracellular matrix components (6Frosch B.A. Berquin I. Emmert-Buck M.R. Moin K. Sloane B.F. APMIS. 1999; 107: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The interplay of different proteolytic systems (serine, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteases) enables tumor cells to detach from the primary tumor, penetrate the extracellular matrix, invade blood and lymphatic vessels and eventually, form metastases (7Thomssen C. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Oppelt P. Pache L. Dettmar P. Jänicke F. Graeff H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 741-746PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the biological role of proteases in tumor invasion and metastasis, high antigen levels of uPA and uPAR, as well as cathepsin B and L, were shown to correlate with poor patient prognosis in different cancer diseases (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar, 8Foekens J.A. Peters H.A. Look M.P. Portengen H. Schmitt M.

Given the involvement of the plasminogen activation system and its increased expression in malignant solid tumors, this system represents an attractive target to attack tumor invasion and metastasis. Several strategies have been employed to efficiently reduce the expression or to affect the proteolytic activity of uPA. These approaches include the use of active site inhibitors, antibodies to uPA or uPAR, as well as oligodeoxynucleotides or RNA directed against uPA and uPAR (4Schmitt M. Wilhelm O.G. Reuning U. Krüger A. Harbeck N. Lengyel E. Graeff H. Gänsbacher B. Kessler H. Bürgle M. Stürzebecher J. Sperl S. Magdolen V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 2000; 14: 114-132Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Other attempts are aimed at abrogation of the uPA/uPAR interaction employing synthetic uPA-derived peptides encompassing the binding region of uPA to uPAR (10Bürgle M. Koppitz M. Riemer C. Kessler H. König B. Weidle U.H. Kellermann J. Lottspeich F. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Goretzki L. Reuning U. Wilhelm O. Magdolen V. Biol.

Hantzopoulos P.A. Graeff H. Gänsbacher B. Schmitt M. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Application of such reagents in in vitro and in vivo studies led to the suppression of uPA expression, a reduction in proteolytic activity, or reduced uPA binding to cell surface-associated uPAR, and consequently to a reduction of tumor cell invasion and metastasis (2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar, 3Andreasen P.A. Egelund R. Petersen H.H. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 25-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Equally importantly, cathepsins B and L also contribute to the invasive phenotype of solid malignant tumors (6Frosch B.A. Berquin I. Emmert-Buck M.R. Moin K. Sloane B.F. APMIS. 1999; 107: 28-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 12Yan S. Sameni M. Sloane B.F. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 113-123PubMed Google Scholar). Human cystatin C, the most potent inhibitor of mammalian cysteine proteases, as well as several other cysteine proteinase inhibitors, prevent tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo (13Kolkhorst V. Stürzebecher J. Wiederanders B. J. Cancer Res. Clin. Oncol. 1998; 124: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 14Cox J.L. Sexton P.S. Green T.J. Darmani N.A. Melanoma Res. 1999; 9: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For instance, the invasive capacity of murine SCC-VII squamous carcinoma cells was significantly reduced by addition of the synthetic inhibitor E-64, an effective inhibitor of lysosomal cysteine proteases and also by CA-074, a specific inhibitor of cathepsin B. Transfection of these cells with a cDNA expression vector encoding cystatin C also resulted in a significant reduction of their invasive potential (14Cox J.L. Sexton P.S. Green T.J. Darmani N.A. Melanoma Res. 1999; 9: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In line with these data, transfection of cystatin C cDNA into B16 melanoma cells resulted in a decrease of the metastatic capacity of these cells, whereas the growth rate of the transfected cells was unaltered (15Coulibaly S.

Both the plasminogen activation system and the cysteine proteases cathepsins B and L represent selective therapeutic targets for the inhibition of tumor invasion and metastasis. Here, we report on the design and characterization of a novel type of bifunctional inhibitor, which reduces the enzymatic activity of cysteine proteases and prevents interaction of uPA with the receptor uPAR. For this dual activity to occur, a loop that is not essential for cysteine protease inhibition in cystatin was replaced by the uPAR binding sequence of uPA. Bifunctional inhibitors of this type were tested for their capacity to simultaneously inhibit cysteine proteases and to suppress uPA binding to uPAR. Synthetic genes of chicken cystatin (chCys(M29I, M89L)) or human cystatin C, cloned into pUC plasmids (16Auerswald E.A. Genenger G. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Machleidt W. Engh R.A. Fritz H. Eur. J.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369 (suppl.): 209-218PubMed Google Scholar), were used as templates in reverse long range PCR (High Fidelity Expand PCR, Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany) for deletion of the DNA sequence encoding aa 71–81 in chicken cystatin (Swiss-Prot accession no.P01038) and aa 73–83 in human cystatin C (Swiss-Prot accession no.P01034), respectively. The deleted regions were substituted by the coding sequences of peptide uPA-(19–31) and uPA-(21–30)(S21C, H29C), respectively, which were introduced by the PCR primers. Subsequently, the coding sequences of the cystatin variants as well as those of chCys(M29I, M89L) (from now on referred as chCys-wt) and hCys-wt were ligated into the bacterial expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The resulting constructs encode cystatins/cystatin variants with an amino-terminally located (histidine)6 tag. The Escherichia coli strain SG10003(pREP4) (Qiagen) was transformed with the vectors and recombinant protein expression induced overnight by the addition of isopropyl−β−d−thiogalactosidase (final concentration 2 mm). The bacteria were lysed in 8 m urea, 0.1m NaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0, the debris removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant subjected to Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography. After two washing steps with 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 0.1 mNaH2PO4, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0 and pH 6.0, respectively, the proteins were eluted with the same buffer but at pH 4.3. Dithiothreitol was added at a final concentration of 2m and the solution stirred overnight at 4 °C. For refolding, the proteins were dialyzed against 6 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0, for 8 h, followed by two dialysis steps against 2 m urea, 50 mm Tris, 300 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmreduced glutathione, 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 8.0, for 2 days each. Finally, the proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, for 24 h and then stored at −20 °C until used. Continuous fluorimetric inhibition assays were performed and evaluated as described in detail (18Machleidt W. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Auerswald E.A. Aviles F.X. Monographs , Innovations on Proteases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1993: 179-196Google Scholar, 19Machleidt W. Nagler D.K. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Stubbs M.T. Fritz H. Auerswald E.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inhibition of papain (10 pm, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), cathepsin B (25 pm, Calbiochem), and cathepsin L (10 pm, Calbiochem) were assayed at 30 °C with the fluorogenic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-7(4-methyl)coumarylamide (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) in 250 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.015% Brij 35, 1 mm dithiothreitol (added freshly) and 1% Me2SO. For cathepsin B, the equilibrium inhibition constants (K i) were determined directly from the initial slope (v o) and the final slope (v i) of the enzyme with inhibitor in the steady state. For papain and cathepsin L, K i values were calculated from the rate constants (K i =k off/k on), which were obtained from pre-steady-state analysis. K i values were corrected for competition with the substrate (20Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80, Pt. C: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). Inhibitorily active concentrations of chicken and human cystatin and their variants were determined by titration with E-64 standardized papain (4 nm) (20Barrett A.J. Kirschke H. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80, Pt. C: 535-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar) using the substrate Z-Phe-Arg-7(4-methyl)coumarylamide (10 μm, Bachem). uPAR-bearing promyeloid human U937 cells, stimulated for 48 h with 1 mm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), were used to investigate the antagonistic effect of chCys-uPA-(19–31) on uPA binding to uPAR. Initially, 2.5 × 105 cells were subjected to acidic buffer (50 mm glycine/HCl, pH 3.0, 1 min, 22 °C) to dissociate endogenous receptor-bound uPA, followed by a neutralization step with 0.5 m HEPES, NaOH, pH 7.5. The still viable cells were incubated with a mixture consisting of FITC-pro-uPA (16 ng) and refolded chCys-uPA-(19–31) and chCys-wt, respectively, and the cell-associated fluorescence was determined by flow cytofluorometry (21Magdolen V. Rettenberger P. Lopens A. Oi H. Lottspeich F. Kellermann J. Creutzburg S. Goretzki L. Weidle U.H. Wilhelm O. Schmitt M. Graeff H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The simultaneous interaction of cystatin variants with papain and suPAR was measured in real time utilizing the BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Papain was immobilized to a CM-5 chip using the amino-coupling kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All of the following experiments were performed in HBS-BSA buffer (HEPES-buffered saline + 0.05% BSA) at 25 °C at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The simultaneous interaction of cysteine proteases, the cystatin/uPA variant, and suPAR was measured after 260 μl of cystatin or the cystatin variants (active concentration 5 μg/ml in HBS-BSA) were applied to papain. Following intensive washing without decrease in the resonance signal, the ternary papain-cystatin (variant)-uPAR complex was formed by injecting 260 μl of different concentrations of recombinant suPAR from Chinese hamster ovary cells (10, 20, 30, and 40 μg/ml, respectively) (21Magdolen V. Rettenberger P. Lopens A. Oi H. Lottspeich F. Kellermann J. Creutzburg S. Goretzki L. Weidle U.H. Wilhelm O. Schmitt M. Graeff H. Electrophoresis. 1995; 16: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Regeneration conditions were not found, because it was not possible to dissociate uPAR and to restore the papain-cystatin variant complexes without loss of their uPAR binding capacity. Therefore, a new flow channel had to be used for each experiment. Control experiments were performed by adding suPAR to the papain/chCys-wt complex or to papain only. To determine the association and dissociation constants of the interaction of suPAR with the cystatin variant chCys-uPA-(19–31), the BIA evaluation software of BIAcore was used, applying nonlinear least square curve fitting to a single-site association and dissociation model. The data were evaluated after selection of the optimal section of each curve using derived logarithmic plots as recommended by BIAcore (22O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 457-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Cystatins, the natural inhibitors of cysteine proteases, as well as uPA-derived peptides, which abrogate uPA/uPAR interaction are well known to reduce the invasive capacity of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. For the design of a bifunctional molecule that combines both functional activities, a loop in human cystatin C and that of chicken cystatin, which is nonessential for cysteine proteinase inhibition, was substituted with the binding sequence of uPA to uPAR (uPA-(19–31)) or a variation of this sequence (uPA-(21−30)[S21C, H29C]), which also abrogates uPA interaction with uPAR. Different cystatins were cloned into the bacterial expression plasmid pQE-30: chicken cystatin (chCys-wt) and human cystatin C (hCys-wt), as well as two chicken cystatin variants and two human cystatin C variants, all containing uPA-(19–31) or uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C]. In the cystatin variants, the loop regions located between the disulfide-bridged Cys71/Cys81 in chicken cystatin and Cys73/Cys83 in that of human cystatin C were substituted by uPA-(19–31) and uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C], respectively (Fig. 1). In all of the cases, transformed E. coli cells induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactosidase produced recombinant cystatin protein, which was purified by Ni2+-chelate chromatography under reducing and denaturing conditions (>95% purity, data not shown). The recovered proteins were refolded and the active concentrations determined; between 6 and 14% of the total protein displayed an inhibitory activity toward papain. The yield of functional active human cystatin variants was rather low compared with the chicken cystatin variants. Therefore, most of the experiments were performed only with chicken cystatin/cystatin variants. The recombinant chicken variants (chCys-wt, chCys-uPA-(19–31), and chCys-uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C]) display K i values for inhibition of papain, cathepsin L, and cathepsin B close to that of natural chicken cystatin from egg white (Table I), indicating that the amino-terminal histidine tag has no negative impact on inhibitory activity. Similar kinetic results were obtained with recombinant human cystatin C and two of its variants, withK i values between 2.5 and 3.0 pm toward papain compared with about 0.5 pm for mature cystatin C (23Alvarez-Fernandez M.

Open table in a new tab The inhibition constants for chCys and chCys-Δ(Cys71-Met89) were taken from Machleidtet al. (18Machleidt W. Assfalg-Machleidt I. Auerswald E.A. Aviles F.X. Monographs , Innovations on Proteases and Their Inhibitors. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1993: 179-196Google Scholar). To investigate whether chCys-uPA-(19–31) inhibits binding of uPA to cell surface-associated uPAR, PMA-stimulated U937 cells were incubated with a mixture of FITC-labeled pro-uPA and purified, refolded chCys-uPA and then subjected to flow cytofluorometry. The cystatin variant containing the uPAR-directed binding epitope of uPA clearly interfered with binding of FITC-uPA to the cells, whereas chCys-wt without uPA-peptide uPA-(19–31) did not affect pro-uPA/uPAR interaction (Fig. 2). From these results it can be concluded that chCys-uPA-(19–31) inhibits cysteine protease proteolytic activity in solution and blocks binding of uPA to cellular uPAR. The ability of the cystatin/cystatin variants to inhibit cysteine proteases and of chCys-uPA-(19–31) to suppress uPA binding to cellular uPAR on U937 cells were determined in independent experiments. These results did not prove that a single molecule displays both characteristics simultaneously. To address this question, surface plasmon resonance technology (BIAcore 2000) was used. For this purpose, the cysteine protease papain was covalently bound to a CM-5 chip (Fig.3). After binding cystatin variants chCys-uPA-(19–31) or chCys-uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C] to the immobilized papain, the resulting papain-cystatin variant complex was washed vigorously. No significant dissociation of the cystatin variants from the immobilized papain was observed. suPAR was added to the immobilized papain/chCys-uPA-(19–31), papain/chCys-uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C], or papain/chCys-wt complexes. suPAR bound to both of the papain-cystatin complexes containing the cystatin/uPA variants but not to papain/chCys-wt or to papain alone. The amount of suPAR binding to the chCys-uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C]-papain complex was lower compared with suPAR binding to papain/chCys-uPA-(19–31). This result corresponds to the results obtained by FACS analysis, demonstrating that cyclo-(19–31)uPA-(19−31) is an ∼3-fold better antagonist of uPA/uPAR interaction than cyclo-(21,29)uPA-(21–30)[S21C, H29C] (data not shown). A concentration-dependent binding of suPAR to chCys-uPA-(19–31)/papain complex was observed (Fig. 3). The binding curves were used for calculation of a K D value for the interaction of suPAR with chCys-uPA-(19–31). Simulation of the binding curves using the BIAcore evaluation software indicated that mass transport seems to be of no importance for this interaction (not shown). The K D value of the interaction of chCys-uPA-(19–31) with suPAR was 17 nm, which is in the range of that of uPA binding to suPAR, which was also measured using surface plasmon resonance (K D = 5 nm, data not shown), indicating that the binding sequence of uPA to uPAR in chCys-uPA-(19–31) is correctly folded and functionally active. Preincubation of suPAR with a 6-fold excess of uPA reduced binding of suPAR to the chCys-uPA-(19–31)/papain complex by 85%, providing further evidence that suPAR indeed interacts with chCys-uPA-(19–31) via the uPA-derived epitope. These results demonstrate that chCys-uPA-(19–31) acts simultaneously with papain and suPAR and therefore functions as a tight-binding inhibitor of cysteine proteases as well as an effective uPA receptor antagonist. The coordinated interaction of different proteolytic systems,e.g. serine proteases, cysteine proteases, matrix metalloproteases, and aspartyl proteases, is important for tumor cell invasion and metastasis (1DeClerck Y.A. Imren S. Montgomery A.M. Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Laug W.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The invasive capacity of tumor cells can be lowered by synthetic inhibitors directed against these different proteases, but also as demonstrated for the plasminogen activator system by antagonists, which prevent focusing of the active proteases uPA to its cell surface receptor (4Schmitt M. Wilhelm O.G. Reuning U. Krüger A. Harbeck N. Lengyel E. Graeff H. Gänsbacher B. Kessler H. Bürgle M. Stürzebecher J. Sperl S. Magdolen V. Fibrinol. Proteol. 2000; 14: 114-132Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have developed and tested a novel type of bifunctional inhibitor directed against two different proteolytic systems. Inhibitors are based on cystatin, a naturally occurring cysteine protease inhibitor into which a uPA-derived binding sequence for uPAR was inserted. This novel type of inhibitor functions on one hand as an active site inhibitor of cysteine proteases and on the other hand as an antagonist of receptor/uPA interaction. Mutations in the region of aa 71−81 of chicken cystatin did not affect the binding of the mutated inhibitor to the target enzymes as expected from previous x-ray- and NMR structure analyses (24Bode W.

Huber R. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1060-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and as demonstrated previously for the chicken cystatin deletion variant (del−helix II), which lacks residues Cys71-Met89 (26Auerswald E.A. Nagler D.K. Schulze A.J. Engh R.A. Genenger G. Machleidt W. Fritz H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 407-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This mutated part of the molecule is not included in the contact region of the inhibitor with the cysteine protease (Fig. 1). As a result, the novel type of inhibitor reacts with cysteine proteases (e.g. papain and cathepsins B and L) and can bind simultaneously to uPAR, the cellular receptor of uPA, as demonstrated by surface plasmon resonance. Various other bifunctional chimeric protease inhibitors have been generated. A fusion protein harboring the amino-terminal part of uPA (aa 1−135) and human serum albumin (ATF-HSA hybrid) significantly reduced the invasive capacity of a breast cancer cell line in vitro (27Lu H. Yeh P. Guitton J.D. Mabilat C. Desanlis F. Maury I. Legrand Y. Soria J. Soria C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Similarly, a uPA-(1–137)/IgG chimera suppressed the metastatic capacity of human PC3 prostate carcinoma cells in nude mice (28Crowley C.W. Cohen R.L. Lucas B.K. Liu G. Shuman M.A. Levinson A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5021-5025Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A significant suppression of B16 melanoma growth and neovascularization was observed after applying a fusion protein consisting of the growth factor-like domain of uPA, uPA-(1–48), fused to the FC portion of human IgG (29Min H.Y. Doyle L.V. Vitt C.R. Zandonella C.L. Stratton-Thomas J.R. Shuman M.A. Rosenberg S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2428-2433PubMed Google Scholar). An inhibitory protein containing two functionally independent domains, which affects the uPA/plasmin system, has been generated by Kobayashi et al.(30Kobayashi H. Sugino D. She M.Y. Ohi H. Hirashima Y. Shinohara H. Fujie M. Shibata K. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This bifunctional inhibitor consists of the ATF (uPA-(1–134)) and domain II of the serine protease inhibitor UTI and reduces experimental tumor invasion and metastasis by suppression of uPA/uPAR interaction via the ATF domain and by inhibition of the serine protease plasmin via UTI. Most importantly, a synergistic effect was observed, as a single application of UTI domain II or ATF resulted in only a relatively small therapeutic effect (30Kobayashi H. Sugino D. She M.Y. Ohi H. Hirashima Y. Shinohara H. Fujie M. Shibata K. Terao T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Other types of fusion proteins consisting of two functionally independent but highly homologous domains have also been developed. Hybrid molecules harboring different parts of the two serpins, α1-proteinase inhibitor and thyroxine-binding globulin, inhibited human leukocyte elastase and bound to thyroxine with high affinity (31Grasberger H.

Nevertheless, all of the chimeric proteins discussed here have been constructed by fusion of independent domains of different proteins (27Lu H. Yeh P. Guitton J.D. Mabilat C. Desanlis F. Maury I.

Janssen O.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15046-15051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In contrast, the presented cystatin variants have been generated, in a novel approach, by replacing 11 aa of the parent cystatin sequence with 13 aa of uPA, resulting in a biologically bifunctional active protein. The new bifunctional cystatin/uPA chimerae may have a broad field of action. They suppress two different tumor-relevant proteolytic systems (1DeClerck Y.A. Imren S. Montgomery A.M. Mueller B.M. Reisfeld R.A. Laug W.E. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 2Reuning U. Magdolen V. Wilhelm O. Fischer K. Lutz V. Graeff H. Schmitt M. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 13: 893-906PubMed Google Scholar), cysteine and serine proteases, thereby leading to an effective inhibition of their matrix degrading proteolytic action. This antiproteolytic activity of the chimeric inhibitor is focused to the cell surface or, alternatively, may take place in the pericellular space. This novel type of bifunctional protease/receptor inhibitor represents a candidate for the exploration of new therapeutic approaches in solid tumors. Both inhibitory functions of the cystatin/uPA variants are located on small and compact molecules, which are encoded by about 400 base pairs only. This may be useful in gene therapeutic approaches with viruses such as AAV (35Monahan P.E. Samulski R.J.

Both fusion proteins were expressed in cell lysate as active, soluble forms as well as in inclusion bodies as improperly folded proteins.

Without altering the acceptor specificity of the transferase, the fusion with the epimerase changed the donor requirement of α1,3-galactosyltransferase from UDP-galactose to UDP-glucose and decreased the cost for the synthesis of biomedically important Galα1,3Gal-terminated oligosaccharides by more than 40-fold. For enzymatic synthesis of Galα1,3Galβ1,4Glc from UDP-glucose and lactose, the genetically fused enzymes f1 and f2 exhibited kinetic advantages with overall reaction rates that were 300 and 50%, respectively, higher than that of the system containing equal amounts of epimerase and galactosyltransferase. These results indicated that the active sites of the epimerase and the transferase in fusion enzymes were in proximity.

The unique enzyme responsible for the formation of the terminal glycoside bond in nature is UDP-Gal:Galβ1,4GlcNHAc α1,3-galactosyltransferase (α1,3GalT), a protein that is absent in humans due to mutational inactivation of the gene (6Galili U.

Anaraki F. Thall A. Hill-Blank C. Radic M. Blood. 1993; 82: 2485-2493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of the interaction of anti-Gal and α-Gal epitopes has led to experimental attempts to overcome hyperacute rejection by either depleting the recipient's anti-Gal through α-Gal-immobilized affinity columns or antagonizing anti-Gal by infusing the recipient's body with soluble synthetic α-Gal oligosaccharides (9Chen X.

Transplantation. 1998; 65: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, such procedures require access to a substantial amount of α-Gal oligosaccharides as well as synthetically derived α-Gal analogs and mimetics. Due to the high cost associated with multiple protection and deprotection steps with a tedious separation procedure at each step in traditional chemical synthesis of oligosaccharides (11Koike K. Sugimoto M. Sato S. Ito Y. Nakahara Y. Ogawa T. Carbohydr. Res. 1987; 163: 189-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 12Matsuzaki Y. Ito Y. Nakahara Y. Ogawa T.

Sadler J.E. Rearick J.I. Paulson J.C. Hill R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1981; 52: 24-175Google Scholar). Nevertheless, since sugar nucleotides required by glycosyltransferases are exceptionally expensive, much work has been focused on in situ sugar nucleotide regeneration through multiple-enzyme systems (15Wong C.-H. Haynie S.L. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 5416-5418Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 16Wong C.-H. Wang R. Ichikawa Y. J. Org.

Synthesis ( Stuttgart ). 1992; 1–2: 141-145Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and on enzymatic transformation to inexpensive sugar derivatives. We have demonstrated that a number of α-Gal oligosaccharides can be synthesized by glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions with regeneration of UDP-Gal through a five-enzyme system (19Fang J.W. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y.N. Wang J.Q. Guo Z.M. Zhang W., Yu, L.B. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Such a multiple-enzyme system undoubtedly increased the complexity of the reaction. We also showed that a simpler alternative was a two-enzyme system in which UDP-galactose 4-epimerase (GalE) converted relatively inexpensive sugar nucleotide UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal, and α1,3-galactosyltransferase carried out the subsequent glycosylation reaction (19Fang J.W. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y.N. Wang J.Q. Guo Z.M. Zhang W., Yu, L.B. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In order to further reduce the cost of α-Gal synthesis as well as to avoid multiple fermentation for enzyme preparations, in this work two bifunctional fusion proteins containing both GalE and α1,3GalT were constructed. GalE carries out the interconversion of UDP-Glc to UDP-Gal, and α1,3GalT catalyzes the transfer of galactose from UDP-Gal to N-acetyllactosamine or its derivatives (Fig. 1 A). The overall function of the fusion proteins is the transfer of galactose from UDP-Glc to the acceptor (Fig. 1 B). These fusion enzymes change the donor requirement of the α1,3GalT from UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc. Furthermore, the fused enzyme system that catalyzes a sequential reaction may also have a kinetic advantage over the mixture of two separated enzymes, since the product of one enzyme travels a shorter distance to be captured by the next enzyme (20Tamada Y. Swanson B.A. Arabshahi A. Frey P.A. Bioconjugate Chem. 1994; 5: 660-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar,21Ljungcranyz P. Carlsson H. Mansson M.O. Buckel P. Mosbach K. Bulow L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8786-8792Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases can be classified mechanistically into two major families, inverting glycosyltransferases and retaining glycosyltransferases, depending on the anomeric configuration at the reaction center. α1,3GalT belongs to the retaining family, since it transfers a galactose residue from an α-linked nucleotide diphospho sugar (UDP-galactose) to the acceptor, forming an α-linked product via the retention of the anomeric configuration. The reaction mechanism was proposed to consist of two nucleophilic substitutions at the sugar anomeric carbon including the transient formation of a glycosyl enzyme intermediate (22Saxena I.D. brown R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lougheed B. Ly H.D. Wakarchuk W.W. Withers S.G. J. Biol.

However, the details of the catalytic mechanism of α1,3GalT remain unknown due to the unavailability of the three-dimensional structure of any retaining glycosyltransferase. The comparison of the kinetic parameters of two fusion proteins with reverse sequence as well as of the native α1,3GalT could provide insights into the mechanism of the α1,3GalT-catalyzed reaction. Plasmid vector pET15b was purchased from Novagen Inc., Madison, WI. Ni2+-NTA-agarose, polymerase chain reaction purification kit, QIAEX II gel extraction kit, QIAamp tissue kit, and DNA miniprep spin kit were from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA).

Plasmid vector pET15b and E. coli competent cell BL21(DE3) [F− ompT hsdSB(rB−mB−) gal dcm (DE3)] were from Novagen Inc. (Madison, WI). Plasmid pET15b-α1,3GalT was constructed as described previously (19Fang J.W. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y.N. Wang J.Q. Guo Z.M. Zhang W., Yu, L.B. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). E. colicompetent cell DH5α (lacZΔM15 hsdR recA) was from Life Technologies, Inc. Chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain K-12 was purified using the QIAamp tissue kit. All of the polymerase chain reactions were performed in a total 50-μl reaction volume containing 5 μl (0.2 μg) of template DNA, a 1 μmconcentration of each of two corresponding primers, MgCl2(2.5 mm), 5 μl of 10× buffer B (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, at 25 °C, 500 mm KCl), 1 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq polymerase. The reaction mixture was covered with 50 μl of mineral oil and subjected to 30 cycles of amplification with an annealing temperature of 55 °C in a Thermolyne Amplitron I thermal cycler (Barnstead Thermolyne Corp., Dubque, IA). Restriction digestions and DNA ligations were performed as directed by the enzyme manufacturers. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli cloning strain DH5α and then expression strain BL21 (DE3). Selected clones were characterized by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. The strategy for constructing plasmids for fusion enzymes is described in “Results.” The expression and purification of the fusion enzymes from the cell lysate were as described before (19Fang J.W. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y.N. Wang J.Q. Guo Z.M. Zhang W., Yu, L.B. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, the overexpression of the enzymes was induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C in a C25 incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific Co., Inc., Edison, NJ). The cell lysate and inclusion bodies were separated by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. From cell lysate, the active enzymes were purified using a Ni2+-NTA-agarose affinity column. After elution, the fractions containing the purified enzyme (detected by UV-visible spectrometry) were combined, and ammonium sulfate was slowly added with stirring to 80% saturation. The suspension was kept at 4 °C for an additional 30 min and then centrifuged. The pellet was dissolved in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, and applied to a Superdex 200 preparation FPLC column preequilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.0) containing 2-mercaptoethanol (10 mm), glycerol (10%), and NaCl (0.25 m). The column was then eluted with the same buffer, and fractions containing fusion protein activity were pooled and concentrated in a Centricon 3 concentrator (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). To obtain the active fusion proteins from the inclusion bodies, the purification and refolding procedures were carried out as described in Ref. 25Zhang Y.N. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar except that a calculated E280 nm0.1% value of 1.6 (26Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Lewis R.V. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 74-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) was used for the fusion enzymes for the determination of enzyme concentration. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 10% gel in a Mini Protein III cell gel electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad) at DC 200 V. High range (40–212 kDa) SDS-PAGE standards (Promega) were used as molecular weight standards, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Enzyme assays for fusion proteins were performed at 37 °C for 30 min in a final volume of 100 μl containing Tris-HCl (10 mm, pH 7.0), MnCl2 (10 mm), bovine serum albumin (0.1%), UDP-d-[6-3H]galactose (0.3 mm) or UDP-d-[6-3H]glucose (final specific activity of 1000 cpm/nmol), fusion enzyme (6.3 pmol), and acceptor (50 mm, lactose or lactose derivatives). Acceptor was omitted for blank. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of ice-cold EDTA (0.1 m). Dowex 1 × 8–200 chloride anion exchange resin was then added in a water suspension (0.8 ml, 1:1 (v/v)). After centrifugation, supernatant (0.5 ml) was collected in a 20-ml plastic vial, and ScintiVerse BD (5 ml) was added. The vial was vortexed thoroughly before the radioactivity of the mixture was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckmann LS-3801 counter). One unit of fusion enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of 1 μmol of galactose from UDP-Glc to lactose/min at 37 °C. Kinetic parameters for the coupled reaction (UDP-Glc → Galα1,3Lac) were gained by assays with UDP-[6-3H]Glc (0.3 mm) and varying concentrations of lactose (7, 8, 10, 12.5, 17, 25, and 50 mm) at 37 °C for 30 min, in which the formation of the product [6-3H]Galα1,3Lac was measured by scintillation counting. Kinetic parameters for the α1,3-galactosyltransferase moiety (UDP-Gal → Galα1,3Lac reaction) in f1 or f2 were obtained by a modification of the standard assay for the transferase (19Fang J.W. Li J. Chen X. Zhang Y.N. Wang J.Q. Guo Z.M. Zhang W., Yu, L.B. Brew K. Wang P.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6635-6638Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), with UDP-[6-3H]Gal (0.3 mm) and varying concentrations of lactose (7, 8, 10, 12.5, 17, 25, and 50 mm). Enzymatic activity of the epimerase moiety (UDP-Glc → UDP-Gal reaction) in the fusion enzymes was obtained with different concentrations of UDP-[6-3H]Glc (1, 1.14, 1.4, 1.6, 2, 2.6, and 4 mm) at 24 °C for 5 min. After deactivating the enzyme by heating at 100 °C for 10 min, the amount of UDP-[6-3H]Gal formed by the epimerase was quantitatively determined by using an excess amount of α1,3GalT to transfer all of the UDP-[6-3H]Gal to [6-3H]Galα1,3Lac. This previously established α1,3GalT-coupled radioactivity assay was proven to be a convenient method for the determination of the epimerase activity (27Chen X. Kowal P. Hamad S. Fan H.N. Wang P.G. Biotech. Lett. 1999; 21: 1131-1135Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The concentrations of all enzymes were determined by the Lowry method (28Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and adjusted to 0.3 μm for fusion enzymes f1 and f2 as well as for native GalE and α1,3GalT. The bifunctional enzyme f1 was prepared by in-frame linking of thegalE gene downstream to the truncated α1,3GalT gene, whose translational stop signal has been removed, through an in-frame linker (GGTGGAGGC) coding for three glycine residues. To obtain the plasmid pET15b-f1, the plasmids pET15b-α1,3GalT (f1) encoding individual α1,3GalT and pET15b-galE (f1) encoding GalE were constructed first (Fig. 2 A). The gene for the α1,3GalT was amplified with two primers α1,3GalT-F-f1 (forward primer, containing restriction site NdeI) and α1,3GalT-R-f1 (reverse primer, containing restriction sitesSpeI, SalI, and BamHI and the codons of the three-glycine linker). NdeI and BamHI restriction sites facilitated the insertion of the α1,3GalT gene into the multiple restriction sites in vector pET15b, while SpeI and SalI were for the introduction of the galEgene. Similarly, the galE gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the chromosomal DNA of E. coli strain K-12 with primers galE-F-f1 (forward primer, containing NdeI and SpeI restriction sites) and galE-R-f1 (reverse primer, containing SalI and BamHI restriction sites). Plasmids pET15b-α1,3GalT (f1) and pET15b-galE (f1) were obtained, respectively, by the digestion with NdeI andBamHI and consequent ligation with the pET15b vector. After confirmation by restriction mapping, both plasmids pET15b-α1,3GalT (f1) and pET15b-galE (f1) were digested with SpeI andSalI. The 6.7-kb digested fragment of pET15b-α1,3GalT (f1) and the 1.1-kb fragment of pET15b-galE (f1) were purified and ligated by T4 DNA ligase to form plasmid pET15b-f1. Another way of fusing the α1,3GalT gene and galE gene together was to join the structural gene of α1,3GalT to the 3′-end of the galE gene. In this case, the translational stop signal of the galE gene was removed. A similar strategy was applied to obtain plasmid pET15b-f2 for fusion protein f2 (Fig.2 B). The primers in the construction of fusion proteins are listed in Table I. All of the plasmids contained a T7 promoter, a T7 terminator, and an ampicillin-resistant gene. The His6 tag fused to the N terminus of the fusion proteins simplified the purification of enzymes by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography. The expressions of both f1 and f2 were under the control of the T7 lac promoter and induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.Table IList of oligonucleotide primers used in the construction of plasmids pET15b-f1 and pET15b-f2 for the fusion proteinsPrimer namePrimer sequenceα1,3GalT-F-f15′-CGAATATCATATGGAAAGCAAGCTTAAGCTATCG-3′α1,3GalT-R-f15′-CGCGGATCCGTCGACACTAGTGCCTCCACCGACATTATTTCTAACCAC-3′GalE-F-f15′-GGACATATGACTAGTATGAGAGTTCTGGTTACC-3′GalE-R-f15′-CGCGGATCCGTCGACTTAATCGGGATATCCCTG-3′GalE-F-f25′-GGAATTCCATATGAGAGTTCTGGTTACC-3′GalE-R-f25′-CGCGGATCCGTCGACGCCTCCACCATCGGGATATCCCTGTGG-3′α1,3GalT-F-f25′-GGACATATGGTCGACGAAAGCAAGCTTAAGCTATCG-3′α1,3GalT-R-f25′-CGCGGATCCTCAGATGTTATTTCTAAC-3′ Open table in a new tab The plasmid pET15b-f1 or pET15b-f2 was transformed into E. coli cloning host DH5α, and positive recombinants were transformed into E. coli expression host BL21 (DE3). Selected colonies were confirmed by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing. When pET15b-f1 was digested with NdeI andBamHI, two fragments with sizes of 5.7 kb (pET15b vector) and 2 kb (α1,3GalT gene plus galE) were observed in agarose gel electrophoresis. When pET15b-f1 was digested withSpeI and SalI, two fragments with sizes of 6.6 kb (pET15b vector plus α1,3GalT gene) and 1100 bp (galE) were observed (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, when pET15b-f2 was digested with NdeI andBamHI, two fragments with sizes of 5.7 and 2 kb were shown. If f2 was digested with SalI and BamHI, two fragments with sizes of 6.8 and 900 bp (α1,3GalT gene) were shown (Fig. 3 B). Both fusion proteins f1 and f2 were efficiently expressed in E. coli expression host BL21 (DE3) and appeared as predominant bands corresponding to a molecular mass of 67 kDa, which were absent in the BL21 (DE3) transformed with the pET15b vector plasmid only (Fig.4). Under the expression conditions (37 °C, 250 rpm, 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction for 3 h), about 12 units of f1 and 10 units of f2 were obtained from the cell lysate of 1 liter cell culture. A large percentage of the fusion proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies. The efficient extraction with 6 m guanidine HCl and proper refolding procedures retrieved 20 units of active enzymes from the inclusion bodies expressed in 1 liter of bacterial culture for both f1 and f2. Similarly to the refolding of recombinant β1,4-galactosyltransferase from the inclusion bodies overexpressed in the same E. coli pET15b-expressing system (25Zhang Y.N. Malinovskii V.A. Fiedler T.J. Brew K. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 815-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the attempt at refolding using a buffer containing Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 7.9), glycerol (10%), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) failed. The successful refolding was achieved in the same buffer except that the dithiothreitol was substituted by a redox system containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide. The necessity of a redox system for generating active enzymes indicated the importance of disulfide bond formation during refolding of the fusion proteins. A better expression level was achieved by lowering the temperature to 30 °C and elongating the incubation time to 20 h after the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. However, as the case under the normal expression conditions (37 °C, 3 h), the amount of the proteins obtained from 1 liter of bacteria culture for f1 remained similar to that for f2, as determined by SDS-PAGE and the activity assay. These results indicated that the relative location of the transferase and the epimerase in the fusion enzymes was not critical for the expression level in the current overexpression system. Purification of the fusion proteins was achieved by a nickel affinity chromatography and a subsequent FPLC HL Superdex 200 (16/60) gel filtration chromatography. After the affinity chromatography, the fusion proteins were purified to about 90% purity. Further purification was achieved for both f1 and f2 by FPLC gel filtration chromatography, which gave a single peak containing fusion protein activity in FPLC elution and a clean single band of about 67 kDa in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4). The molecular weights of the fusion enzymes were estimated by gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 200 column. Both hybrid enzymes eluted as single peaks corresponding to a molecular mass of 140 kDa, as determined by comparison with the protein standards performed under the same conditions. The molecular mass for either f1 or f2 determined by SDS-PAGE was estimated to 67 kDa (Fig. 4). The monomers of both fusion proteins have theoretical calculated molecular masses of 74 kDa. These results suggest that both f1 and f2 are homodimers with total molecular mass of about 140 kDa under native conditions. The measured kinetic parameters in Table IIreveal some properties of the fusion enzymes. First, thek cat values of the α1,3GalT moieties (UDP-Gal → Galα1,3Lac reaction) in f1 and f2 are similar to that of the native α1,3GalT. However, the Km value of f1 for lactose (8.5 mm) is decreased to about a half of that of the native α1,3GalT (15 mm). Therefore, the catalytic efficiency of the α1,3GalT moiety in f1 is higher (k cat/Km = 0.053 s−1 mm−1) compared with that of f2 or of the native α1,3GalT. It is important to point out that the epimerase part of the fusion enzymes participated in the conversion of UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc, which decreased UDP-Gal concentration and slowed down the reaction, during the measurement of the α1,3GalT activity for f1 and f2. Therefore, the kinetic parameters shown in Table II are only approximate determinations. Second, it is found that the catalytic efficiencies of the epimerase moieties (UDP-Glc → UDP-Gal reaction) in f1 and f2 are greatly reduced (∼25-fold) in comparison with that of the native GalE. Dissecting to individual parameters, thek cat value of f1 is similar to that of the native GalE, and the efficiency loss of the GalE in f2 mainly comes from the poorer binding to UDP-Glc. For f2, the decrease of the efficiency comes from both a lower k catand a higher Km . Third, when considering the overall fusion enzyme activity in the coupled reaction (UDP-Glc → Galα1,3Lac reaction), the catalytic efficiency of f1 is about 8 times higher than that of f2. This is mainly due to the fact that f1 has a lower Km .Table IIApparent kinetic parameters of f1, f2, and related individual enzymesEnzymeActivity2-aKinetic parameters for the coupled reaction (UDP-Glc → Galα1,3Lac) were gained by assays with UDP-[6-3H]Glc (0.3 mm) and varying concentrations of lactose (7, 8, 10, 12.5, 17, 25, and 50 mM) at 37 °C for 30 min, in which the formation of the product [6-3H]Galα1,3Lac was measured by scintillation counting.

Purified MioC has a UV-visible spectrum characteristic of a flavoprotein and contains flavin mononucleotide. The presence of flavin mononucleotide and the primary sequence similarity to flavodoxin suggest that MioC may function as an electron transport protein. The role of MioC in the biotin synthase reaction is discussed, and the structure and function of MioC is compared with that of flavodoxin. Biotin synthase is required for the conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin and requires a number of accessory proteins and small molecule cofactors for activity in vitro.

At least three other proteins are required for biotin synthase activity. Two have been identified as flavodoxin and ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+reductase (6Birch, O. M., Brass, J.

The reduced Fe-S cluster has been proposed to reductively cleaveS-adenosylmethionine to give methionine and a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (7Birch O.M. Fuhrmann M. Shaw N.M. J. Biol.

Evidence from experiments with deuterium-labeled dethiobiotin suggests that the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom directly from dethiobiotin (11Escalettes F. Florentin D. Tse Sum Bui B. Lesage D. Marquet A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 3571-3578Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two recent reports demonstrated that the Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase also serves as the immediate sulfur donor for the dethiobiotin to biotin conversion (4Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F.

The Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase may therefore have a dual function, and Fe-S cluster forming proteins, such as IscS, IscU and IscA, may thus be required for catalytic activity (13Zheng L.

This protein eluted from a Q-Sepharose column at a NaCl concentration of ∼0.5 m and required TPP to stabilize its activity during purification. We have now purified this protein, obtained a N-terminal amino acid sequence and identified it as MioC. In this paper we also report the cloning, overexpression, and characterization of MioC.DISCUSSIONBiotin synthase, anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase activating enzyme (AE), and pyruvate formate lyase AE all utilize flavodoxin, ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase, NADPH, andS-adenosylmethionine and contain an Fe-S cluster. In contrast to biotin synthase, the 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical formed by the reductive cleavage of S-adenosylmethionine by pyruvate formate lyase AE and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase AE abstracts a hydrogen atom to give a protein-based radical, which then reacts with the substrate (20Becker A. Fritz-Wolf K. Kabsch W. Knappe J. Schultz S. Wagner A.F.V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 969-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 21Mulliez E. Ollagnier S. Fontecave M. Ferreira G.C. Moura J.G. Franco R. Iron Metabolism. Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH, Weinheim, Germany1999Google Scholar). The requirement for further additional proteins for activity also distinguishes biotin synthase from the pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase enzyme systems. Unlike biotin synthase, both anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase AE and pyruvate formate lyase AE are catalytic in vitro and have fully defined assay systems.The mioC gene is located next to oriC on theE. coli chromosome and although several investigations have tried to establish a role for mioC transcription in chromosome replication (22Løbner-Oleson A. Atlung T. Rasmussen K. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2835-2842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Asai T. Jpn. J. Genet. 1991; 66: 85-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 24Ogawa T. Okazaki T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1609-1615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the results were inconclusive (25Løbner-Oleson A. Boye E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3029-3036Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,26Bates D.B. Boye E. Asai T. Kogoma T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12497-12502Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To date, no function for MioC has been established. We have now shown that MioC is essential for E. coli biotin synthase activity in vitro.When highly purified biotin synthase was incubated with photo-reduced deazaflavin in the absence of any other proteins, it was active (27Méjean A. Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Ploux O. Izumi Y. Marquet A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1231-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suggests that photo-reduced deazaflavin can replace both the NADPH, flavodoxin, and ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+reductase electron transport system and MioC. In addition, sequence comparison studies predicted that MioC had a similar structure to flavodoxin and a flavin-binding motif (28Grandori R. Carey J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and we have provided experimental evidence that it binds FMN. Based on these observations, we propose that MioC is part of the electron transport system for biotin synthase. Our results can most easily be explained by MioC transferring electrons from flavodoxin to the Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase. Although the NADPH → ferredoxin (flavodoxin) NADP+ reductase → flavodoxin electron transport pathway has recently been verified by redox potentiometry (8McIver L. Leadbeater C. Campopiano D.J. Baxter R.L. Daff S.N. Chapman K. Munro A.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the reduction potential of the Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase remains unknown, and hence the final electron transfer step from flavodoxin to biotin synthase has not been confirmed.Biotin synthase has not yet been shown to catalyze the conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin in vitro. The Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase provides the sulfur atom for the dethiobiotin to biotin conversion (4Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Gibson K.J. Pelletier D.A. Turner Sr., I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so that Fe-S cluster forming or reforming enzymes may also be required for activity. The absence of these and MioC may be partly responsible for the very low catalytic center activity of the enzyme in the assay system with photo-reduced deazaflavin and highly purified biotin synthase (between 0.04 and 0.08/h, calculated from the results in Ref. 28Grandori R. Carey J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).The x-ray crystal structure of E. coli flavodoxin (Protein Data Bank file code 1ag9) shows that it crystallizes with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Calcium, sodium, and chloride ions form salt bridges between the two molecules. Determination of the native molecular mass of MioC by gel filtration chromatography in low salt conditions showed MioC to be a dimer, but at relatively high salt concentrations (1.0 m NaCl) it behaved as a monomer, which is consistent with the disruption of intermolecular salt bridges.During the original purification of MioC, where its activity in the biotin synthase reaction was measured, the addition of TPP to the buffers helped to maintain its activity. MioC has no TPP binding site, and following purification, TPP had no effect on its activity in the assay. We have no explanation for the positive effect of TPP during purification.In conclusion, we have shown that MioC is required for biotin synthase activity in vitro. We suggest that MioC may have an electron transport role based on its predicted similarity to flavodoxin and its binding of FMN, and the fact that it can be replaced in the biotin synthase assay in vitro by photo-reduced deazaflavin. Despite inclusion of MioC in the biotin synthase assay, catalytic activity was still not observed. Unknown factors, such as Fe-S cluster forming enzymes, may have been missing. Further experiments are required to confirm the role of MioC in vivo and as part of a catalytic system for the formation of biotin. Biotin synthase (BioB) catalyzes the final step of the biotin biosynthetic pathway, where a sulfur atom is inserted between the unactivated methyl and C-6 methylene carbon atoms of dethiobiotin (1Flint D.H.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the reduction potential of the Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase remains unknown, and hence the final electron transfer step from flavodoxin to biotin synthase has not been confirmed. Biotin synthase has not yet been shown to catalyze the conversion of dethiobiotin to biotin in vitro. The Fe-S cluster of biotin synthase provides the sulfur atom for the dethiobiotin to biotin conversion (4Tse Sum Bui B. Florentin D. Fournier F. Ploux O. Méjean A. Marquet A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 12Gibson K.J. Pelletier D.A. Turner Sr., I.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 254: 632-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), so that Fe-S cluster forming or reforming enzymes may also be required for activity. The absence of these and MioC may be partly responsible for the very low catalytic center activity of the enzyme in the assay system with photo-reduced deazaflavin and highly purified biotin synthase (between 0.04 and 0.08/h, calculated from the results in Ref. 28Grandori R. Carey J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2185-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of E. coli flavodoxin (Protein Data Bank file code 1ag9) shows that it crystallizes with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Calcium, sodium, and chloride ions form salt bridges between the two molecules. Determination of the native molecular mass of MioC by gel filtration chromatography in low salt conditions showed MioC to be a dimer, but at relatively high salt concentrations (1.0 m NaCl) it behaved as a monomer, which is consistent with the disruption of intermolecular salt bridges. During the original purification of MioC, where its activity in the biotin synthase reaction was measured, the addition of TPP to the buffers helped to maintain its activity. MioC has no TPP binding site, and following purification, TPP had no effect on its activity in the assay. We have no explanation for the positive effect of TPP during purification. In conclusion, we have shown that MioC is required for biotin synthase activity in vitro. We suggest that MioC may have an electron transport role based on its predicted similarity to flavodoxin and its binding of FMN, and the fact that it can be replaced in the biotin synthase assay in vitro by photo-reduced deazaflavin. Despite inclusion of MioC in the biotin synthase assay, catalytic activity was still not observed. Unknown factors, such as Fe-S cluster forming enzymes, may have been missing. Further experiments are required to confirm the role of MioC in vivo and as part of a catalytic system for the formation of biotin. We thank Dr. R. T. Aplin for mass spectroscopy, Dr. M.

However, it is dependent on mitochondria and is characterized by increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates that are essential to the death process. To identify signaling molecules involved in this TNF-induced, reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent cell death pathway, we performed a comparative study by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of phosphoproteins from a mitochondria-enriched fraction derived from TNF-treated and control cells. TNF induced rapid and persistent phosphorylation of the phosphorylation-responsive regulator of the microtubule (MT) dynamics, oncoprotein 18 (Op18). By using induced overexpression of wild type Op18 and phosphorylation site-deficient mutants S25A/S38A and S16A/S63A in L929 cells, we show that TNF-induced phosphorylation on each of the four Ser residues of Op18 promotes cell death and that Ser16 and Ser63are the primary sites. This hyperphosphorylation of Op18 is known to completely turn off its MT-destabilizing activity. As a result, TNF treatment of L929 cells induced elongated and extremely tangled microtubules. These TNF-induced changes to the MT network were also observed in cells overexpressing wild type Op18 and, to a lesser extent, in cells overexpressing the S25A/S38A mutant. No changes in the MT network were observed upon TNF treatment of cells overexpressing the S16A/S63A mutant, and these cells were desensitized to TNF-induced cell death. These findings indicate that TNF-induced MT stabilization is mediated by hyperphosphorylation of Op18 and that this promotes cell death. The data suggest that Op18 and the MT network play a functional role in transduction of the cell death signal to the mitochondria.

Old L.J. Kassel R.L. Green S. Fiore N. Williamson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3666-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (3738) Google Scholar). In addition to its anti-tumor and anti-malignant cell effects, TNF has been reported to influence mitogenesis, differentiation, and immunoregulation of various cell types. The activities of TNF are mediated through two cell surface receptors, namely TNF-R55 (CD120a) and TNF-R75 (CD120b), which are expressed by most cell types. TNF's effects are mediated primarily through TNF-R55. Upon activation of the receptor, adaptor proteins such as TRADD and TRAF are recruited and bind to the intracellular part of the clustered receptor (for a review, see Ref. 2Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar). These receptor-associated molecules that initiate signaling events are largely specific to the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor family. However, the downstream signaling molecules are not unique to the TNF system but also mediate effects of other inducers. Downstream signaling molecules in the TNF system identified so far include caspases, phospholipases, the three mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and the NF-κB activation cascade. In the mouse fibrosarcoma cell line L929 used in this study, TNF induces cytotoxicity and also has gene-inducing activity, some of which is mediated through NF-κB activation. It has been shown that these activities are uncoupled in L929 cells. Specifically, SB203580, an inhibitor of the p38 MAP kinase, which is involved in TNF-induced cytokine expression, completely inhibits TNF-induced synthesis of IL-6, while TNF-induced cytotoxicity is unaffected (3Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stable overexpression of a transdominant negative form of IκB-α results in the inability to activate NF-κB and inducibly express interleukin-6 but has no effect on TNF-induced cell death (4Hehner S.P. Hofmann T.G. Ratter F. Dumont A. Droge W. Schmitz M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18117-18121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). TNF-induced cell death in L929 cells is characterized by a necrosis-like phenotype and does not involve DNA fragmentation (Ref. 5Grooten J. Goossens V. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar; for a review, see Ref. 6Fiers W. Beyaert R. Declercq W. Vandenabeele P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7719-7730Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). It is independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release but is dependent on mitochondria (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 8Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates in the mitochondria that are essential to the death process (9Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 10Goossens V. De Vos K. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vancompernolle K. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mitochondria translocate from a dispersed distribution to a perinuclear cluster (11De Vos K. Goossens V. Boone E. Vercammen D. Vancompernolle K. Vandenabeele P. Haegeman G. Fiers W. Grooten J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9673-9680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); functional implications of this mitochondrial translocation remain unclear. While much effort has been directed at the molecular mechanism of the caspase-dependent cell death pathway, relatively little is known about the TNF-induced reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent cell death pathway. To identify molecules involved in the latter, we performed a comparative study of the phosphoproteins from TNF-treated and control cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. It is known that upon activation of the TNF receptor, several kinases/phosphatases are activated (12Guy G.R. Chua S.P. Wong N.S. Ng S.B. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14343-14352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,13Guy G.R. Cao X. Chua S.P. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1846-1852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, most of the changes in phosphorylation occur very rapidly (2–15 min) upon binding of TNF to its receptors, and most of them are transient and related to the gene-inductive activities of TNF. To identify molecules that are involved in the cytotoxic process downstream of the receptor-proximal events, we studied lysates from cells that had been stimulated with TNF for 1.5 h. To date, three proteins with reproducible and large increases in phosphorylation upon TNF treatment have been detected; in this study we examined one of those proteins, oncoprotein 18 (Op18, stathmin). Op18 is a conserved cytoplasmic phosphoprotein that is highly expressed in a wide variety of cancers, including a subset of leukemias and breast carcinomas (14Hanash S.M. Teichroew D. Electrophoresis. 1998; 19: 2004-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 15Brattsand G. Roos G. Marklund U. Ueda H. Landberg G. Nanberg E. Sideras P. Gullberg M.

Cancer. 1998; 78: 701-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Its high abundance seems to be necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype (17Jeha S. Luo X.N. Beran M. Kantarjian H. Atweh G.F. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1445-1450PubMed Google Scholar). Op18 is a phosphorylation-responsive regulator of microtubule (MT) dynamics that increases the catastrophe rate of MTs (depolymerization or shrinkage phase of individual MTs) in a dose-dependent manner (18Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar,19Belmont L.D. Mitchison T.J. Cell. 1996; 84: 623-631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Op18 can be phosphorylated in vivo on four Ser residues (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63) (20Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is a target for both cell cycle and cell surface receptor-coupled kinase systems (for a review, see Ref. 21Lawler S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on all four Ser residues completely turns off its MT-destabilizing activity, leading to increased levels of MT polymer and stabilized MTs in vivo (18Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol.

This multisite phosphorylation occurs during mitosis and is essential for formation of the mitotic spindle and thus progression through the cell cycle. However, the actual role of Op18 in mitosis could be rather passive, and the only thing that may be required during mitosis is switching off its microtubule-destabilizing activity. The high stoichiometry of Op18 phosphorylation by several receptor-regulated kinase systems suggests that the primary role for Op18 may be to regulate the MT system in response to external signals in interphase cells. In this paper, we describe for the first time a functional role for Op18 in TNF-induced cell death. All L929 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (5%, v/v), heat-inactivated newborn calf serum (5%, v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm), at 37 °C in a humidified incubator under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Murine TNF was produced in Escherichia coli and purified to at least 99% homogeneity in our laboratory. It had a specific activity of 1.9 × 108 IU/mg of protein (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, UK), contained 4 ng of endotoxin/mg of protein, and was used at 1000 IU/ml. Recombinant human interferon-α, which is also active on murine cells, was a generous gift from Dr. C. Weissmann (University of Zürich); it had a specific antiviral activity of 7.9 × 107 units/mg, as determined on murine cells in a L929 cell/vesicular stomatitis virus assay and was used at 1000 units/ml. Propidium iodide (PI) and cycloheximide (CHX) (all from Sigma) were used at concentrations of 30 μm and 50 μg/ml, respectively. The polyclonal anti-Op18 antiserum was a generous gift from Dr. M. Gullberg (University of Umeå, Umeå, Sweden). The cDNAs encoding WT Op18 and phosphorylation site-deficient mutants were generous gifts from Dr. M. Gullberg (University of Umeå). Plasmid pSP64Mx, containing the murine Mx promoter, was donated by Dr. C. Weissmann (25Hug H. Costas M. Staeheli P. Aebi M. Weissmann C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3065-3079Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSV2neo contains the bacterial neomycin gene used as a selection marker in transfection experiments (26Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). Inserts encoding the mutants and WT Op18 were isolated asXhoI/SmaI fragments from the Bluescript pBS plasmid and cloned as blunted fragments into the bluntedBamHI site of the pSP64Mx expression vector. Cell death in L929 and L929-derived cell lines was induced by the addition of TNF (1000 IU/ml) to the cell suspension. Cell death was measured by quantifying PI-positive cells by FACS (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). The PI dye was excited with an argon-ion laser at 488 nm; PI fluorescence was measured above 590 nm using a long pass filter. Routinely, 3,000 cells were analyzed. Cell death is expressed as the percentage of PI-positive cells in the total cell population. L929 cells were plated 48 h prior to the experiment.32P labeling was carried out as described in Ref. 13Guy G.R. Cao X. Chua S.P. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1846-1852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. TNF treatments (1000 IU/ml, 1.5 h) were done in the presence of CHX, to synchronize cell death. To simplify the two-dimensional phosphoprotein pattern and subsequent computer-assisted analysis, we prepared two subcellular protein fractions. The cytosolic protein fraction, containing soluble cytoplasmic molecules and molecules derived from single-membrane organelles, was obtained as the supernatant from digitonin (0.03%)-permeabilized cells. After rinsing once with excess phosphate-buffered saline buffer, the remaining cell fraction was lysed in a CHAPS (2%)-containing buffer as described in Ref. 13Guy G.R. Cao X. Chua S.P. Tan Y.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1846-1852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. This lysate was then centrifuged (20,000 ×g), and the supernatant was used as the organelle fraction; it is enriched for mitochondrial and cytoskeleton-derived proteins. The three protein spots detected with increased phosphorylation upon TNF treatment were present in both subcellular fractions. Isoelectric focusing was carried out on 18-cm IPG strips, pH 4–7 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein samples were precipitated with ethanol and redissolved in lysis buffer. The second dimension (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) was run on large horizontal Excell gradient gels, 12–14% acrylamide (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14%) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were incubated with the desired antibody, followed by ECL-based detection (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Amino acid sequence analysis of peptides derived from anin situ digest of a Coomassie Blue-stained two-dimensional gel protein spot was performed as described previously (27Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar). L929 cells were grown on glass coverslips for 48 h. Following TNF treatment, cells were fixed with methanol at −20 °C. MTs were stained with a rat anti-tubulin hybridoma YOL1/34 supernatant (Harlan Sera-Lab, Crawley Down, UK) and detected with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Harlan Sera-Lab). Coverslips were mounted in VectaShield and analyzed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. Fig.1 A shows the autoradiogram of the two-dimensional gels from TNF-treated and control samples. The protein spot with increased phosphorylation identified as Op18 is indicated by the arrow. It was identified by nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry analysis of tryptic peptides derived from an in situ digest of the excised protein spot (data not shown). The identity of the spot was further confirmed by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against Op18 (Fig. 1 B). As shown, TNF treatment increased the amount of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of Op18, which correspond with the α1, α2, and α11 forms, according to the pattern described in Ref. 20Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The α1 form is phosphorylated on either Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, or Ser63; the α2 form is phosphorylated on either Ser16/Ser63, Ser16/Ser38, Ser63/Ser25, Ser63/Ser38, or Ser25/Ser38; the α11 form is phosphorylated on Ser16/25 (this form has reduced mobility on SDS gels, probably due to the close proximity of the two phosphoserine residues). Increased phosphorylation of Op18 was observed after 10 min of TNF treatment (data not shown). However, the increase in phosphorylation was more pronounced after 1.5 h of TNF treatment. These data indicate that TNF-induced phosphorylation of Op18 is an early but long lasting event. As already mentioned TNF can induce cytotoxicity and has gene-inducing activity in L929 cells. These two activities are uncoupled, and only the gene-inducing pathway is sensitive to the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 (3Beyaert R. Cuenda A. Vanden Berghe W. Plaisance S. Lee J.C. Haegeman G. Cohen P. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1914-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). To determine which pathway the TNF-induced phosphorylation of Op18 was part of, we examined whether TNF-induced phosphorylation of Op18 was inhibited by SB203580. None of the TNF-induced phosphoisoforms was affected by the inhibitor (data not shown), indicating that phosphorylation of Op18 is independent of gene activation. To investigate the role of Op18 and its phosphorylation in TNF-induced cell death, we overexpressed WT Op18 and the phosphorylation site-deficient mutants Op18 S25A/S38A and Op18 S16A/S63A in L929 cells. We chose an inducible expression vector for two reasons. First, it has been shown that overexpression of phosphorylation site-deficient mutants of Op18 causes a block during mitosis (18Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). A second and more important reason is the large clonal variability in sensitivity to TNF-induced cell killing, ranging in L929 subclones from almost resistant to complete cell killing in 3 h. 2K. Vancompernolle, unpublished observations. Because of the latter, it is unwise to compare TNF sensitivity among different clones. However, use of an inducible expression vector circumvents this clonal variability, because TNF sensitivity can be compared in the same clone upon induced expression of the protein. Murine fibrosarcoma L929 cells were transfected with pSP64MxOp18 WT and phosphorylation site-deficient mutants using the calcium phosphate procedure. In this expression vector, Op18 is under the control of the murine Mx promoter that is inducible by type I interferon (IFN). Although the murine Mx promotor has been reported to result in tightly controlled heterologous gene expression in VERO cells (28Lleonart R. Naf D. Browning H. Weissmann C. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 1263-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we found quite leaky expression in our system. After a preliminary screen of G418-resistant clones, clones were further selected according to the following criteria: low leak expression, strong induced expression, and little or no cell toxicity upon induced expression of the protein. As a result, we obtained five clones expressing WT Op18 and only two clones per mutant with a low level of leak expression that was well tolerated by the cell and strongly induced expression of the proteins. For induction, cells were incubated with 1000 IU/ml human interferon-α for 16 h prior to TNF treatment. Levels of the ectopically expressed proteins in the Op18 clones in the noninduced and induced states and the endogenous levels of Op18 in the control clones (Neo) are shown in Fig. 2, Aand B. Essentially, all Op18 clones had detectable leak expression but also a strong induced expression. TNF-induced cell death in the different clones was measured as a function of time by flow cytometry, using PI uptake as the parameter for the number of dead cells (5Grooten J. Goossens V. Vanhaesebroeck B. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1993; 5: 546-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For practical reasons, the experiments were performed in two sets. In the first set, we measured the effect of induced expression of WT Op18 on TNF-induced cell death. In a second set of experiments, we measured the effect of induced expression of the phosphorylation site-deficient mutants on TNF-induced cell death in comparison with clones overexpressing WT Op18 and control clones. The experiments were repeated several times, and similar results were obtained each time. Representative experiments are shown in Fig. 2. C and D show the percentage of cell death after 5 h of TNF treatment of the different clones in noninduced and induced conditions. The same results are presented inE and F, respectively, as the percentage increase in cell death in induced over noninduced conditions. As Fig. 2 clearly indicates, induced overexpression of WT Op18 caused a significant increase (average of 40–50%) in TNF-induced cell death compared with the same clones in the noninduced state. A slight increase (average of 6%) in cell death was also observed in control clones (Neo), due to human interferon-α treatment of the cells. An increase (average of 34%) in cell death was also observed in the clones overexpressing the Op18 S25A/S38A mutant. On the contrary, no increase, or even a decrease (average of −2%), in cell death was observed in the clones overexpressing the Op18 S16A/S63A mutant. This decrease would be even more pronounced if the slight increase in cell death in the human interferon-α-treated control clones were taken into consideration. To verify whether there was a correlation between the phosphorylation status of the ectopically expressed proteins and the effect on TNF-induced cell death, we examined the two-dimensional gel pattern of the phosphoisoforms of WT Op18 and mutants in TNF-treated and control cells (Fig. 3). Based on the two-dimensional pattern of the phosphoisoforms described in Ref. 20Beretta L. Dobransky T. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20076-20084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, TNF induces phosphorylation on all four Ser residues (Ser16, Ser25, Ser38, and Ser63) of WT Op18, with a marked increase in the α2 and α3 phosphoforms. In Fig. 3, the triple (α12) and quadruple (α22) phosphorylated forms are evident. The triple and quadruple phosphorylated forms were not detected in parental cells (Fig. 1 B), probably because they were below the limit of detection. This hyperphosphorylation on all four Ser residues leads to maximum inactivation of the MT destabilizing activity of Op18 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 22Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The β0 isoform was also apparent upon TNF treatment; this isoform is derived from the same mRNA as the α0 form but has an as yet unknown post-translational modification (30Doye V. Soubrier F. Bauw G. Boutterin M.C. Beretta L. Koppel J. Vandekerckhove J. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12134-12137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the clone overexpressing the Ser25/Ser38 mutant, TNF still increased the amount of mono- and diphosphorylated forms and thus represents phosphorylation on Ser16 and Ser63. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the increase is derived from the endogenous protein, since it has been shown that during mitosis dual phosphorylation of Ser25 and Ser38 is required for phosphorylation of Ser16 and Ser63 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, this might be different in interphase cells. Strikingly, upon TNF treatment, no change in the phosphorylation pattern was observed in the clone overexpressing the S16A/S63A mutant. Taken together, these results clearly indicate that TNF-induced hyperphosphorylation of Op18 promotes cell death, and phosphorylation on Ser16 and Ser63 seems to be a prerequisite for this. These data correlate well with the down-regulation of the MT-destabilizing activity of Op18 by phosphorylation described in the literature. Specifically, phosphorylation of either Ser16or Ser63 in combination with Ser25 and Ser38 inhibits the MT-destabilizing activity of Op18 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), while phosphorylation of both Ser 16 and 63 is sufficient to inhibit the MT destabilizing activity of Op18 in interphase and mitotic cells (24Gradin H.M. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Given the function of Op18 as a regulator of MT dynamics, we tested whether TNF actually induced changes in the organization and polymerization status of the MTs in L929 cells. As shown by immunofluorescence microscopy in Fig.4, parental L929 cells have a fine and not very dense network of MT filaments dispersed throughout the cell, excluding only the nucleus. After only 10 min of TNF treatment, at which point increased phosphorylation of Op18 was already detectable, the MT network had changed. Specifically, there was an overall increase in the immunofluorescence signal, showing a denser microtubule network. Even more pronounced changes in the organization of the MTs were evident after 1.5–3 h of TNF treatment (Fig. 4). A strong increase in the immunofluorescence signal was observed and a very dense and extremely tangled network of MTs was present. Additionally, the MTs were considerably more elongated and extended toward the rim of the cell. In addition, TNF-treated cells had a more spread phenotype (before they started to die), in comparison with control cells. To investigate whether these TNF-induced changes in the MT network were mediated by phosphorylation of Op18, we examined the organization of the MT network in stable L929 clones that inducibly overexpressed WT Op18 and the phosphorylation site-deficient mutants Op18 S25A/S38A and Op18 S16A/S63A. Overexpression of WT Op18 and phosphorylation site-deficient mutants resulted in depolymerization of MTs, in agreement with previous reports (18Marklund U. Larsson N. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5290-5298Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 22Horwitz S.B. Shen H.J. He L. Dittmar P. Neef R. Chen J. Schubart U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8129-8132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In Fig.5 (left panels), it can be seen that there are few microtubules present in the untreated cells (control) and that they are not homogeneous in thickness. Furthermore, the overall fluorescence signal was weak, indicating low amounts of MT polymer. TNF treatment of cells overexpressing WT Op18 resulted in the appearance of a dense network of elongated MTs. Additionally, the MTs appeared thicker than those in TNF-treated parental cells (Fig. 4). A TNF-induced increase in MTs was also observed in cells overexpressing the Op18 S25A/S38A mutant, although to a lesser extent than in cells overexpressing the WT protein (Fig. 5). However, the MTs were not as thick as in the TNF-treated cells overexpressing WT Op18. On the contrary, no change in the MT network could be detected upon TNF treatment of cells overexpressing the Op18 S16A/S63A mutant. It is noteworthy that the degree of tangling of MTs observed after TNF treatment is less pronounced in cells overexpressing WT Op18 than in parental cells. This may be because untreated cells overexpressing WT Op18 have lower levels of MT polymer than parental cells. In this case, higher levels of phosphorylated Op18 would be required to cause the same morphological change in the MT network observed after TNF treatment of parental cells. It is also possible that the TNF-induced changes in the MT network may be caused not only by phosphorylated Op18 but also by other regulators of MT dynamics. Taking the data together, we draw the conclusion that TNF induces the stabilization of MTs, mediated by hyperphosphorylation of Op18. This MT stabilization is responsible for promotion of TNF-induced cell death. In this study, we have identified Op18 as a protein that becomes rapidly and persistently phosphorylated upon TNF treatment of the fibrosarcoma cell line L929. TNF-induced cell death in these cells is independent of caspase activation and cytochrome c release but is dependent on mitochondria (7Schulze-Osthoff K. Beyaert R. Vandevoorde V. Haegeman G. Fiers W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3095-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar, 8Schulze-Osthoff K. Bakker A.C. Vanhaesebroeck B. Beyaert R. Jacob W.A. Fiers W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is accompanied by increased production of reactive oxygen intermediates in the mitochondria (9Goossens V. Grooten J. De Vos K. Fiers W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8115-8119Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar,10Goossens V. De Vos K. Vercammen D. Steemans M. Vancompernolle K. Fiers W. Vandenabeele P. Grooten J. Biofactors. 1999; 10: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TNF treatment of the L929 cells also resulted in morphological changes in the MT network. A dense network of more elongated and extremely tangled MTs appeared and extended toward the rim of the cell. The role of Op18 and its phosphorylation in TNF-induced cell death was further investigated by induced overexpression of the WT protein and phosphorylation site-deficient mutants Op18 S25A/S38A and Op18 S16A/S63A in L929 cells. Induced overexpression of WT Op18 significantly increased TNF-induced cell death. TNF treatment of these cells induced hyperphosphorylation of Op18 (on all four Ser residues), which is known to turn off its MT-destabilizing activity. Accordingly, TNF treatment also resulted in more elongated MTs and increased levels of MT polymer. The effect of induced overexpression of the phosphorylation site-deficient mutant Op18 S25A/S38A on TNF-mediated cell death was not significantly different from that of WT Op18. TNF still induced phosphorylation in this mutant, with an increase of the mono- and diphosphorylated forms. Furthermore, increased levels of MT polymer were observed upon TNF treatment of the cells, but to a lesser extent than cells overexpressing WT Op18. On the contrary, induced overexpression of the phosphorylation site-deficient mutant Op18 S16A/S63A significantly decreased, but did not block, TNF-induced cell death. No increase in phosphorylation in this mutant was observed, nor could we detect any change in the MT network after TNF treatment of the cells. These results indicate that promotion of TNF-induced cell death by phosphorylated Op18 is directly correlated with increased levels and stabilization of the MTs. These data correlate well with previous reports in the literature. It has been shown that phosphorylation of either Ser16 or Ser63 in combination with Ser25 and Ser38 inhibits the activity of Op18 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and that dual phosphorylation on Ser16 and Ser63 by protein kinase A is necessary and sufficient to switch off the MT-destabilizing activity of Op18 in intact cells (24Gradin H.M. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on Ser25 and Ser38 are of only minor importance in regulating the activity of Op18 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); this may explain why overexpression of the Op18 S25A/S38A mutant still has a cell death-promoting role, since its MT-destabilizing activity still can be turned off. On the contrary, overexpression of the Op18 S16A/S63A mutant does not promote and may even decrease TNF-induced cell death, because its MT-destabilizing activity cannot be turned off. There are several possible explanations as to why TNF-induced cell death is not completely blocked by the latter. First, endogenous WT Op18 is still present, and thus the mutant protein has to compete with the WT protein. Second, TNF can also modulate the activity of other MT regulatory proteins that may all contribute to cell death. Furthermore, the MT system is not the only event involved in TNF-induced cell death in L929 cells. 3K. Vancompernolle, unpublished data. This suggests that TNF-induced cell death is the result of a concerted series of events. In summary, we conclude that TNF-induced hyperphosphorylation of Op18 promotes cell death and that phosphorylation on Ser16 and Ser63 is necessary for this. Furthermore, the TNF-induced changes in the MT network (MT stabilization) can be attributed to the TNF-induced phosphorylation of Op18, and MT stabilization is in fact responsible for the TNF-induced cell death-promoting activity of phosphorylated Op18. Analysis of the phosphorylation status of the ectopically expressed proteins after TNF treatment also reveals that the hierarchical order of Op18 phosphorylation is different from that in mitosis. During mitosis, dual phosphorylation on Ser25 and Ser38 is required for phosphorylation on Ser16and Ser63 (23Larsson N. Marklund U. Gradin H.M. Brattsand G. Gullberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5530-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, in TNF-treated cells, no change in phosphorylation of the Op18 S16A/S63A mutant could be detected, while there was an increase in the mono- and diphosphorylated forms of the Op18 S25A/S38A mutant. Thus, during TNF-induced cell death, phosphorylation on Ser16 and/or Ser63 is required before phosphorylation on Ser25 and/or Ser38 can occur. Therefore, the hierarchical order of Op18 phosphorylation might determine a differential way of regulating MT-destabilizing activity of Op18 during cell proliferation and cell death. The TNF-induced multisite phosphorylation of Op18 also indicates that several kinases become activated. It is tempting to speculate that protein kinase A is one of the likely candidates, since it has been shown that protein kinase A is activated by TNF (31Zhang Y.H. Lin J.X. Yip Y.K. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6802-6805Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and that induced expression of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A can switch off the activity of Op18 in vivo by phosphorylation on Ser16 and Ser63 (24Gradin H.M. Larsson N. Marklund U. Gullberg M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, several other kinases can also phosphorylate Op18 (21Lawler S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: R212-R214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lovric J. Dammeier S. Kieser A. Mischak H. Kolch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22848-22855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the kinases involved in TNF-triggered phosphorylation of Op18 remain to be determined. Op18 and the MT network seem not only to play a role in TNF-induced cell death, but it has been reported that activation of p53 in cells also appears to target MT regulatory proteins. Notably, Op18 and MAP4 are down-regulated following p53 induction in, among others, MCF-7 cells (33Ahn J. Murphy M. Kratowicz S. Wang A. Levine A.J. George D.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5954-5958Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that restoration of p53 function in these cells sensitizes cells that are TNF-resistant (because of the presence of mutated p53) to the cytotoxic action of TNF (34Ameyar M. Shatrov V. Bouquet C. Capoulade C. Cai Z. Stancou R. Badie C. Haddada H. Chouaib S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5464-5472Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of Op18 would also result in MT stabilization, since it has been shown that microinjection of neutralizing anti-Op18 antibodies into newt long cells results in an increase of MT polymer and an associated decrease in catastrophe frequency (35Howell B. Deacon H. Cassimeris L. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3713-3722PubMed Google Scholar). This may mean that Op18 is not only targeted by TNF via the kinase pathway but also transcriptionally, via p53. The question of whether Op18 phosphorylation and MT stabilization directly or indirectly contribute to the TNF-induced mitochondria- and reactive oxygen intermediate-dependent cell death pathway remains unresolved. Currently, more and more data are emerging that indicate that microtubules play a role in signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 36Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). MTs, together with MAPs and/or motor proteins, could contribute to the transmission of signals from the cell membrane to downstream targets in the cytoplasm. Three models have been proposed for this: 1) MT sequestering and delivery, 2) MT delivery, in which motor proteins are involved, and 3) MT scaffolding of signaling molecules (36Gundersen G.G. Cook T.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 81-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Thus, it could be that the role of Op18 in TNF signaling to cell death is indirect and that the only function of phosphorylated Op18 is to stabilize the MTs. This would mean that a primary signaling cascade is initiated starting from the TNF receptor and leading to MT stabilization that in turn may contribute to and promote the transmission of the death signal to the mitochondria. This primary signaling cascade presumably involves not only Op18; TNF might also modulate the activity of other MT regulatory molecules. The exact mechanism of signal transfer from the MTs to the mitochondria remains to be determined. However, a more direct role of Op18 in the signal transfer to the mitochondria is not excluded. It is interesting to note that Op18 is differentially expressed in the brain of mitochondrial Mn-superoxide dismutase-deficient mice (37Li Y. Chan P.H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 55: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This Mn-superoxide dismutase deficiency causes oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, two phenomena also occurring in TNF-induced cell death in L929 cells. As a result, it could be that Op18, in addition to regulating MT dynamics, has an additional, as yet unidentified cellular function. We are very grateful to Dr. Gullberg for the generous gift of anti-Op18 antibodies and the cDNAs encoding WT Op18 and the phosphorylation site-deficient mutants. We also are indebted to Dr. C. Weissman for providing pSP64Mx and an IFN-α (A/D) preparation."

The 4386-nucleotide cDNA is homologous to other voltage-gated, rapidly inactivating Kv1.4 channels, and includes a 1986-nucleotide coding region and large 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions. Bovine Kv1.4-specific mRNA from adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF) cells was rapidly and potently reduced by ACTH, with a t 12 of approximately 1 h and an IC50 of 1.2 pm. The membrane-permeable cAMP analog 8-pcpt-cAMP also reduced bKv1.4 mRNA expression with kinetics similar to that observed with ACTH. Reduction of bKv1.4 mRNA expression by ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP was only partially inhibited by the selective protein kinase A antagonist H-89. Consistent with their effect on bKv1.4 mRNA, ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP both dramatically reduced the expression of bKv1.4-associated A-type current measured over 72 h. These results demonstrate that bovine AZF cells synthesize a Kv1.4-type channel whose expression is inhibited at the pretranslational level by ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP by a mechanism that is partially dependent on the activation of protein kinase A. The rapid, potent reduction of bKv1.4 mRNA produced by ACTH and 8-pcpt-cAMP indicates that the expression of this K+ channel is under tonic inhibitory control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. The basic electrical properties of AZF cells might be tightly regulated at the transcriptional level by the normal diurnal pattern of ACTH secretion, and altered during bouts of stress by the enhanced release of this pituitary peptide. Under conditions of prolonged stress or adrenal insufficiency, persistent ACTH-induced changes in the electrical properties of AZF cells could be coupled to parallel changes in cortisol secretion.

In excitable secretory cells, these K+ channels regulate action potential frequency and waveform, and therefore function critically in regulating depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry and secretion of neurotransmitters and peptide hormones (1Hille B. Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates Inc., Sunderland, MA1992Google Scholar). Some secretory cells such as the cortisol-producing cells of the adrenal zona fasciculata (AZF)1 lack voltage-gated Na+ channels and Na+-dependent action potentials, the hallmark of excitable cells (2Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Mlinar B. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen.

Despite the absence of action potentials, ion channels function pivotally in the regulation of cortisol secretion. AZF cells express both voltage-gated Ca2+ and K+ channels, and maintain membrane potentials near the K+ equilibrium potential (2Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 217-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 3Mlinar B. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Mlinar B.

Cortisol production by these cells is coupled to depolarization-dependent Ca2+ entry (6Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Bovine AZF cells express two types of K+-selective channels, including a voltage-gated rapidly inactivating A-type K+ channel (IA) and a non-inactivating, ATP-activated channel (IAC) that is only weakly voltage-dependent (3Mlinar B. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol.

Of these two, IACsets the resting potential of AZF cells, while its rapid inhibition by the pituitary peptide ACTH is linked to membrane depolarization, Ca2+ entry through T-type Ca2+ channels and cortisol secretion (5Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. Mol.

Although the IAK+ current is expressed at high density in nearly every AZF cell (3Mlinar B. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), its role in AZF cell function and the physiology of cortisol secretion has not been determined. Unlike IAC channels, IA channels are not acutely inhibited by ACTH in whole-cell patch clamp recordings from AZF cells (3Mlinar B. Enyeart J.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 239-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 5Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol.

In addition to its rapid effects on the electrical and secretory properties of AZF cells, which involve the modulation of existing proteins including K+ channels and steroidogenic enzymes, ACTH also induces more prolonged effects by enhancing the transcription of selected genes. Specifically, ACTH and its primary second messenger cAMP induce the transcription of steroidogenic enzymes, as well as immediate early genes that code for transcription factors, which may in turn regulate AZF cell secretion, growth, or differentiation (9Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Enyeart J.J. Boyd R.T. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Cell.

Besides acutely regulating the activity of K+ channels involved in cortisol secretion, ACTH could potentially produce enduring changes in the electrical and secretory activity of AZF cells by altering the expression of the genes that encode K+ channel proteins. However, the cloning of genes encoding ion channels in steroid-secreting cells has not been reported. We have cloned cDNAs that code for a rapidly inactivating Kv1.4-type K+ channel expressed by bovine AZF cells (bKv1.4). The expression of this gene is potently and effectively reduced by ACTH. Tissue culture medium, antibiotics, fibronectin, fetal bovine sera, formamide, and salmon sperm DNA were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc.

Culture dishes were purchased from Corning (Corning, NY) Coverslips were from Bellco (Vineland, NJ). Phosphate-buffered saline, enzymes, ACTH-(1–24), AII, 8-pcpt-cAMP, dextran sulfate, and formaldehyde were from Sigma. GAPDH cDNA, ULTRAhyb, and RNAlater were from Ambion (Austin, TX). RNeasy columns for total RNA isolation were obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Probes were labeled using a Prime-It II kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). BAK4 and NGFI-B cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. M. Criado (Labatoria de Neurobiologia Molecular, Universitad de Alicante, Alicante, Spain) and Dr. J. D. Milbrandt (Washington University, St. Louis, MO), respectively. Custom adrenal cortex cDNA library in Lambda Zap II was from Stratagene. Bovine adrenal glands were obtained from steers (age range, 1–3 years) within 1 h of slaughter at a local slaughterhouse. Fatty tissue was removed immediately, and the glands were transported to the laboratory in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% dextrose. In a sterile tissue culture hood, the adrenal glands were cut in half lengthwise and the lighter medulla tissue trimmed away from the cortex, immersed in five volumes of RNAlater solution, stored at −20 °C, and subsequently used for poly(A)+ mRNA isolation. The capsule with attached glomerulosa and thicker fasciculata-reticularis layer were then dissected into pieces approximately 1.0 × 1.0 × 0.5 cm3. A Stadie-Riggs tissue slicer (Thomas Scientific) was used to slice fasciculata-reticularis tissue from the glomerulosa layers by slicing 0.3–0.5-mm slices from the larger pieces. Cortical tissue was either immersed five volumes of RNAlater solution or collagenase-digested. Isolated AZF cells were digested and prepared as described previously (7Enyeart J.J. Gomora J.C. Xu L. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). After isolation, cells were either resuspended in DMEM/F12 (1:1) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and the antioxidants 1 μm tocopherol, 20 nm selenite, and 100 μm ascorbic acid (DMEM/F12+) and plated for immediate use, or resuspended in fetal bovine serum plus 5% Me2SO, divided into 1-ml aliquots each containing about 2 × 106 cells, and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use. Cells were plated in either 60-mm dishes or 35-mm dishes containing 9-mm2 glass coverslips. Dishes or coverslips were treated with fibronectin (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min and then rinsed with warm, sterile phosphate-buffered saline immediately before adding cells. Cells were plated in DMEM/F12+ and were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from dissociated AZF cells that had been plated as described above in DMEM/F12+ and maintained in culture for 24 h. AZF poly(A)+ mRNA was used to construct a custom cDNA library (Stratagene) in Lambda ZapII, primed using a combination of oligo(dT) and random primers. The cDNA library was screened using a 1.3-kb PVUII fragment cleaved from a 2.2-kb BAK4 K+ channel cDNA. This cDNA codes for a voltage-gated, rapidly inactivating A-type K+ channel of the Kv1.4 family that was reported to have been cloned from a bovine adrenal medullary cDNA library (13Garcia-Guzman M. Calvo S. Cena V. Criado M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The 1.3-kb cDNA probe includes transmembrane segments S1 through S6 of the bovine BAK4 cDNA. Approximately 1 × 106 plaques were screened using established procedures (14Velan B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K.

Clones were sequenced using an Applied Systems sequencer (model 373A, version 1.2.1 software). bKv1.4 mRNA was quantitated by Northern blot analysis using RNA isolated either directly from adrenal tissue, or from AZF cells as described below. An adrenal mRNA blot was obtained by isolating poly(A)+mRNA directly from dissected adrenal medulla or cortex tissue using a Poly(A)pure kit (Ambion). Poly(A)+ mRNA (7 μg) from medulla and cortex was separated on a denaturing 8% formaldehyde, 1.0% agarose gel, photographed using a Foto/Prep I transilluminator and FCR-10 instant camera (Fotodyne, Hartland, WI) to ensure even loading of RNA, and then transferred to Gene Screen Plus hybridization membrane. The RNA was fixed to the membrane by UV-cross-linking using a Stratalinker (Stratagene). For other Northern blots, AZF cells were plated on 60-mm fibronectin-treated dishes in DMEM/F12+ at a density of 4–6 × 106 cells/dish. After 24 h, the serum-supplemented medium was removed, and replaced either with control medium (DMEM/F12+) or the same medium containing ACTH-(1–24), AII, or 8-pcpt-cAMP, as required. At the end of the incubation period, total RNA was extracted using RNAeasy columns (Qiagen) and 15 μg was separated by gel electrophoresis and transferred as described above. bKv1.4 mRNA was measured using a 2295-bp AflII fragment (base pairs 1056–3351 of the 4386-nt clone) that contained the entire coding region. GAPDH mRNA was measured as an internal standard for gel loading. Blots were prehybridized in heat-sealable plastic bags for 2 h at 42 °C in either ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for bKv1.4 probing, or 50% formamide, 5× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) for hybridization with GAPDH and NGFI-B cDNA probes. The blots were hybridized overnight with a random-primed [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled probe in a minimal volume of hybridization solution. After 15–18 h the blots were washed twice at room temperature in 2× SSPE for 15 min, then twice at 40 °C in 1× SSPE, 1% SDS for 30 min. Membranes probed with bKv1.4 were further washed at 65 °C with 0.1× SSPE, 1% SDS for 30 min. Autoradiograms were obtained by exposing the blots for 5–96 h to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C. RNA was quantitated using ImageQuant 4.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA). Values for bKv1.4 and NGFIB mRNA were normalized to GAPDH mRNA value for the same gel lane. Patch clamp recordings of K+ channel currents were made in the whole-cell configuration. The standard pipette solution was 120 mmKCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mmBAPTA, and 200 μm GTP, and 5 mm MgATP with pH buffered to 7.2 using KOH. The external solution consisted of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, and 5 mm glucose, pH 7.4, using NaOH. The development of the non-inactivating IAC K+ current that is present in these cells was completely eliminated by including 200 μm cAMP in the pipette solution. cAMP selectively inhibits IAC K+ current, but does not alter IA under these conditions (8Enyeart J.J. Mlinar B. Enyeart J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Enyeart J.J. Xu L. Gomora J.C. Enyeart J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 164: 139-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filters. AZF cells were used for patch clamp experiments 1–72 h after plating. Typically, cells with diameters of <15 μm and capacitances of 8–15 picofarads were selected. Coverslips were transferred from 35-mm culture dishes to the recording chamber (volume, 1.5 ml), which was continuously perfused by gravity at a rate of 3–5 ml/min. Patch electrodes with resistances of 2–3 megohms were fabricated from Corning 0010 glass (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). These routinely yielded access resistances of 4–6 megohms and voltage clamp time constants of less than 100 μs. K+ currents were recorded at room temperature (22–25 °C) following the procedure of Hamill et al. (16Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar) using an Axopatch 1D patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments). Pulse generation and data acquisition were done using a personal computer and PCLAMP software with a TL-1 interface (Axon Instruments). Currents were digitized at 5–20 kHz after filtering with an 8-pole Bessel filter (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA). Linear leak and capacity currents were subtracted from current records using scaled hyperpolarizing steps of 1/3 to 1/4 amplitude. Data were analyzed and plotted using PCLAMP 5.5 and 6.04 (CLAMPAN and CLAMPFIT) and SigmaPlot (version 4.0). A bovine AZF cDNA library was screened for K+ channel clones using a 1.3-kb PVUII restriction fragment of BAK4 that includes the S1 through S6 transmembrane segments. The BAK4 cDNA codes for a rapidly inactivating A-type K+ current that was cloned from a putative bovine adrenal medullary cDNA library (13Garcia-Guzman M. Calvo S. Cena V. Criado M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The screening of ≈1 × 106 recombinants led to the identification of 64 positives, 13 of which were chosen for sequencing. Sequence analysis of these clones indicated that each coded for the same Kv1.4 K+ channel that was >99% homologous to BAK4. The cDNA sequence and predicted amino acid sequence of the largest of the bKv1.4 clones is shown in Fig. 1. This 4386-nt clone is 1321 nucleotides longer than the sequence reported for BAK4, due to large 5′- and 3′-non-coding regions measuring 1157 and 1242 nt, respectively. The large non-coding regions are typical of Kv1.4 K+ channels (17Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

The bKv1.4 translatable sequence codes for a K+ channel protein that is highly homologous to other mammalian Kv1.4 proteins, and differs only slightly from that predicted for BAK4 (13Garcia-Guzman M. Calvo S. Cena V. Criado M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 283-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol.

Specifically, one difference (a T to G change at nt 1335), coupled with a subsequent 3-nt insertion (GTG in nt positions 1336–1338) results in two differences from BAK4 in the predicted amino acid sequence of bKv1.4. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from fresh bovine adrenal tissue showed that bKv1.4 mRNA is expressed primarily or solely in the adrenal cortex rather than the adrenal medulla (Fig. 2). A 2295-nt probe (nt 1056–3351 of bKv1.4) that included the full-length coding region of bKv1.4 hybridized to separate ≅3.4- and ≅4.4-kb transcripts of poly(A)+ mRNA isolated from adrenal cortical tissue (Fig. 2). Separate transcripts of 3.5 and 4.5 kb coding for the same mouse Kv1.4 K+ channel have previously been reported (17Wymore R.S. Negulescu D. Kinoshita K. Kalman K. Aiyar J. Gutman G.A. Chandy K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15629-15634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The bKv1.4-derived cDNA probe hybridized much more weakly to mRNA transcripts of similar size that were isolated from adrenal medullary tissue (Fig. 2). ACTH induces the transcription of genes coding for steroidogenic enzymes and immediate early genes in the adrenal cortex (9Simpson E.R. Waterman M.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1988; 50: 427-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar, 10Enyeart J.J. Boyd R.T. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 124: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). ACTH produced a dramatic time-dependent decrease in the quantity of bKv1.4 mRNA transcripts in cultured bovine AZF cells. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 3 A, AZF cells were plated and maintained in culture for 24 h before treatment with ACTH (1 nm) for periods ranging from 1 to 24 h. bKv1.4 mRNA was strongly expressed in the untreated cells. After a 1-h exposure to ACTH, bKv1.4 mRNA, including both the large and small transcripts, was reduced by 43% compared with time-matched control values. At 5 and 24 h, bKv1.4 mRNA was further reduced by 90.6% and 92.7%, respectively, compared with time-matched controls. Kv1.4 mRNA decreased much more gradually with time in untreated cells. In Fig. 3 A, bKv1.4 mRNA was reduced by only 6% after 5 h in control medium, compared with the >90% reduction observed in the presence of ACTH. By 24 h, bKv1.4 mRNA in untreated cells was reduced by approximately 40% compared with its initial value. bKv1.4 mRNA in ACTH-treated cells was nearly undetectable at this time. AII activates losartan-sensitive AT1 receptors on AZF cells, eliciting many of the responses that are triggered by ACTH. Specifically, AII inhibits the non-inactivating IACK+ channel, depolarizes AZF cells, stimulates cortisol secretion and triggers the transcription of immediate early genes (5Mlinar B. Biagi B.A. Enyeart J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8640-8644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,10Enyeart J.J. Boyd R.T. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 124: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, AII failed to induce a time-dependent decrease in bKv1.4 transcripts (Fig. 3 B). In the experiment illustrated, AII (10 nm) did not significantly reduce bKv1.4 mRNA compared with time-matched control values measured at 1, 5, and 24 h. Similar results were obtained in each of three experiments. The ACTH-induced reduction of bKv1.4 mRNA occurred rapidly, with kinetics that lagged only slightly behind those for induction of mRNA for the immediate early gene NGFI-B. In the experiment illustrated in Fig. 4, AZF cells were treated with ACTH (1 nm) for periods ranging from 0.5 to 4 h. At each time point, bKv1.4 mRNA was compared with that for NGFI-B mRNA, which we previously had shown to be induced by ACTH in these cells (10Enyeart J.J. Boyd R.T. Enyeart J.A. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 124: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). At 1, 2, and 4 h, ACTH (1 nm) reduced bKv1.4 mRNA by 54%, 80%, and 91% respectively, relative to time-matched controls. In the same experiment, NFGI-B mRNA was weakly expressed in control medium, but increased 5- and 14-fold after 30- and 60-min exposures to ACTH, returning to near its control value by 4 h. Overall, in a total of five experiments, a 4-h exposure to ACTH reduced bKv1.4 transcripts by 91.8 ± 0.5%. AZF cells express a single population of ACTH receptors withKd values of 1–2 nm (18Rai"

B, phosphorylation of IIAChb. Phosphorylation was assayed by native gel electrophoresis (no SDS, 16% polyacrylamide gel). Reaction mixtures (20 μl) were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and contained 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.1 μg of Enzyme I and 0.1 μg of HPr. Lane 1, IIAChb (4 μg) without PEP; lane 2, IIAChb (4 μg) + 10 mm PEP. The gel was stained using Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Phospho-IIAChbcould also be visualized in reaction mixtures containing [32P]PEP by autoradiography (not shown). C, kinetics and requirements for phosphorylation of IIAChb. Phosphorylation was measured by the filter binding assay described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots (50 μl) were taken over the indicated time course from reaction mixtures incubated at 37 °C containing 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm[32P]PEP and the following proteins: ●, IIAChb (425 pmol), Enzyme I (4.5 pmol), HPr (4.5 pmol); ▪, IIAChb (425 pmol), Enzyme I (1.5 pmol), HPr (1.5 pmol); ○, Enzyme I or HPr or PEP were omitted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structures of the Enzyme II complexes, i.e. the sugar-specific components or permeases of the PTS, are currently under intense investigation. One suggested nomenclature of the complexes derives from amino acid sequence and functional homologies (8Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Saier M.H. Reizer J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1433-1438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They can be divided into distinct domains, designated IIA, IIB, and IIC. For some sugars the IIA, IIB, and IIC domains are encoded by a single (membrane bound) polypeptide, for others IIBC forms a single membrane protein component with a separate soluble IIA protein. The (GlcNAc)2 permease offers many advantages for studying the structure/function of an Enzyme II complex because the IIABC domains are encoded by three separate genes, one each for the IIA, IIB, and IIC. But more importantly, IIBChb is cytoplasmic, which offers a rare opportunity to conveniently study its interactions with its partners, IIAChb and IICChb. Based on sequence homologies IIAChb has been assigned to the lactose family of PTS transporters (8Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but there is virtually no published information on IIAChb nor, of course, on phospho-IIAChb. Although both the crystal and solution structures of an active site mutant protein of IIBChb have been reported (11Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Jacuinod M. Roepstorff P. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), there is little published information on IIBChb itself and nothing on phospho-IIBChb, the subjects of the accompanying papers. In the present report, homogeneous IIAChb and phospho-IIAChb are described along with some important properties of the proteins. Analytical sedimentation studies of the proteins are presented in an accompanying paper (3Keyhani N.O. Rodgers M. Demeler B. Hansen J. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Buffers and reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. [32P]PEP was a kind gift from Dr. N. Meadow (Johns Hopkins University). Cellulose nitrate filters (diameter, 25 mm; pore size, 0.45 μm) were obtained from Sartorius. E. colistrain BL21(DE3):ΔEI, containing a kanamycin cartridge in Enzyme I was a kind gift from Dr. F. Chauvin. Preparations, analyses, restriction enzyme digests, ligations, and transformations were performed using standard techniques (12, 13Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Double-stranded DNA was prepared from recombinant clones and sequenced by the dideoxy method using a U.S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit or alternately by the Genetics Core Facility (Johns Hopkins Medical School) using an ABI-373 automated sequencer. The open reading frame corresponding to the chbA gene was cloned into the pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) overexpression vector using polymerase chain reaction and primers specific to the ends of the gene. The primers were designed with unique restriction sites at each end to facilitate the cloning procedure. The polymerase chain reaction generated fragments were first cloned into the pNoTA/T7 shuttle vector (Prime PCR Cloner Cloning System; 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and then subcloned into pET21a (according to the manufacturer's recommendations and procedures). Primers were designed (at the 5′ end of the gene) such that the start site (ATG) codon would be ligated directly to the NdeI/start site of pET21a. The nucleotide sequences of the primers are given below. The engineered restriction sites are underlined, and the start site of the gene is in bold. The primers used were as follows. 5′-GAGGAACGACATATG ATGGATCTC-3′ (NdeI site) and 5′-TCACTGGCTGGATCCTCGACTCC-3′ (BamHI). The isolated subclones in pET21a were confirmed by sequencing the entire insert. When the protein was overexpressed from pET21a and crude extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE, a new major band was detected that migrated at the expected molecular mass (12.75 kDa). SDS-PAGE was therefore used to detect the protein throughout the purification procedure. Two liters each of LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in two 6-liter flasks were inoculated with 80 ml of an overnight culture of E. colistrain BL21(DE3):ΔEI harboring the plasmid pET-chbA. The culture was shaken vigorously at 37 °C untilA 600 was about 1.0 (2–3 h) before being induced by the addition of 1 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside or 3 mm melibiose. Cells were then allowed to grow for an additional 2 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The following steps in the purification were conducted at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. The cell pellet was washed twice with 500 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA and resuspended in the same buffer using 4.0 ml of buffer/g (wet weight) of cells. The cells were disrupted by two passages through a Wabash French Press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Nulceic acids were precipitated with a solution of streptomycin sulfate (160 μl of 10% stock/ml crude extract) added dropwise with stirring. The white precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 30 min and discarded. The supernatant from Step 2 was transferred to a 50-ml DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column equilibrated in the same buffer. The column was washed with 100 ml of 50 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, followed by 100 ml of buffer containing 0.1m NaCl. A gradient (1 liter) from 0.1 to 0.5 mNaCl in the buffer was applied, and 9.0-ml fractions were collected. The IIAChb protein eluted at around 0.25 mNaCl. Fractions were pooled based on estimated protein amount and purity as determined by SDS-PAGE. Pooled fractions from Step 3 were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m NaCl and transferred to a Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The chelating gel (30 ml) was first charged with CuCl2 (60 ml, 2 mg/ml) before being equilibrated in the starting buffer 50 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. After loading the sample, the column was washed with two column volumes each (60 ml) of the following solutions: 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl; 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.1m NaCl; and 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1 m NH4Cl. The column was re-equilibrated in the starting buffer before being eluted with a gradient (300 ml) of 0–20 mm imidazole in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1m NaCl. The protein IIAChb eluted at around 7–10 mmimidazole. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated by pH precipitation. Precipitation was carried out as follows (at 4 °C); the pH of the pooled fractions was gradually lowered by the dropwise addition of 500 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH ∼4.3, until the pH was around 5–5.5. The solution was stirred for 1 h before the precipitate was collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 30 min). The pellet was resuspended in 100 mmdibasic sodium phosphate buffer, pH ∼9.2. The final pH was 8.0, and the solution was dialyzed against 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The FPLC Mono-Q purification step was performed at room temperature. The fraction from Step 4 was transferred to an FPLC Mono-Q HR10/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0. The column was washed with two column volumes of buffer (16 ml) before being eluted with a linear gradient (160 ml) from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The protein eluted between 0.3 and 0.35 m NaCl. The IIAChb containing fractions were pooled and concentrated by pH precipitation as described above. An FPLC HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-100 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was equilibrated in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0. The pooled concentrated fractions (4–8 ml) from Step 5 were transferred to the column and eluted with the same buffer. Purified IIAChb was dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and lyophilized for long term storage. For denaturing gels, unless otherwise noted, protein samples were heated at 100 °C for 3–5 min in loading buffer (65 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8, with 0.3% SDS, 5% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue) prior to being electrophoresed in a vertical 12–18% polyacrylamide slab gel, pH 8.0, with a 6% stacking gel, pH 6.8. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250. Native gel electrophoresis was carried out essentially as described for denaturing gels except SDS was omitted from all buffers and samples were not boiled prior to loading. The Novex gel electrophoresis system and precast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA) were also employed under both native and denaturing conditions. Stained protein bands on the gels were quantitated by densitometric scanning using the Eagle Eye Video System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The purified proteins were subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 475A protein sequencer (Department of Biological Chemistry, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine). The assay was performed essentially as described (14Buhr A. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11599-11603Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For measurement of IIAChb phosphorylation the assay reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 2–5 pmol of purified Enzyme I, 5–10 pmol of purified HPr, and 100–1000 pmol of purified IIAChb. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 μmol of [32P]PEP (10–20 cpm/pmol). Aliquots were taken over the time course, the reaction stopped by dilution with 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mmNaCl) and rapidly filtered through cellulose nitrate filters (Sartorius). The filters were washed twice with 1 ml each of ice-cold buffer, immersed in 4 ml of Packard Ultima-Gold XR liquid scintillation counter mixture, and counted in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. Phosphorylation reactions for preparative isolation of phospho- IIAChb were performed on a large scale as described above. Typically, 1.0-ml reaction mixtures contained 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.1–0.3 nmol of purified Enzyme I, 0.25–0.5 nmol of purified HPr, and 35–100 nmol of purified IIAChb. The mixture was incubated for 45–60 min at 37 °C. The phosphoprotein was purified by native gel electrophoresis using 16% acrylamide gels. Stacking and resolving gels and buffer were identical to the SDS-PAGE procedure except that SDS was omitted from all buffers. Protein samples were maintained at 4 °C prior to loading onto the gel, and the sample loading buffer was modified to contain the following (final concentrations): 0.1 mTris-HCl buffer, pH 9.3, 5% glycerol, 0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2 mm DTT. To identify the position of the phosphoprotein in the gel after electrophoresis, lanes on both sides of the gel were cut and either briefly stained with Coomassie Blue or (where proteins were labeled with 32P) further cut into slices, immersed in 3.0 ml of scintillation fluid, and counted as described above. The remaining portion of the gel was then sliced and the desired (phospho)-protein product recovered by electroelution at 250 V for 2 h at 4 °C in an Amicon Centrilutor. Electroelution buffer was either 12.5 mm Tris borate, pH 8.7, or 15 mmTris-CAPS, pH 9.3. The eluate was concentrated to 0.5 ml by ultrafiltration in a Centricon-3 and stored in aliquots at −80 °C until used. The phosphorylation reaction was performed as described above or using HPr coupled to Affi-Gel-15-agarose beads beads (see below). The reaction was terminated by sedimenting the HPr beads (10,000 × g, 5 min), and the supernatant was applied to a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (10 mm × 300 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated and eluted with 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system. Protein in the eluate was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. Fractions corresponding to phospho-IIAChb were either used immediately or stored at −70 °C; the phosphoprotein was stable for at least 3 days under these conditions. Purified HPr (kind gift of Dr. R. Mattoo) was coupled to Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 3.6 mg of purified HPr in 2 ml of 10 mm MOPS buffer, pH 6.5, were added to 1.5 ml of washed Affi-Gel 15 resin and reacted at 4 °C for 4 h on a rotating shaker. About 50% of the protein remained in the solutions and was removed. Unreacted groups on the resin were blocked with ethanolamine as recommended by the manufacturer. The rate of hydrolysis of [32P]phospho-IIAChb was determined as a function of pH. The following buffers were used: McIlvaine's sodium phosphate-citric acid broad range buffer from pH 2.0 to 8.8, Bates' and Bowers' boric acid-KCl buffer (pH 8.0–10), sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, sodium borate, Tris-HCl buffer, MOPS-HCl, and TAPS-HCl. Three separate procedures were used to measure the remaining 32P-labeled protein and the product [32P]Pi: Phosphoproteins were separated from [32P]Pi by chromatography on Whatman DEAE-paper (DE-81) using conditions (15Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) where the phosphoproteins remained at the origin, whereas phosphate migrated with the solvent front. Briefly, aliquots of the reaction mixtures (25–50 μl) were spotted on strips of DE-81 (2 × 10 cm) and developed by ascending chromatography using a solvent containing 35% ethanol, 10 mm CAPS, pH 10.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl, for 1–2 h at room temperature. The strips were dried, cut in half, immersed in 3.0 ml of scintillation mixture, and counted as described above. Reaction mixtures containing [32P]Pi, [32P]PEP, and32P-labeled proteins were subjected to paper electrophoresis as described (16Kundig W. Ghosh S. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1964; 52: 1067-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Kundig W. Roseman S. Methods Enzymol. 1966; 9: 396-403Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Aliquots (50 μl) were spotted onto Whatman 3MM paper saturated with 1% tetraborate, pH 9.3, and subjected to electrophoresis at 50 V/cm for 30–45 min. After drying the paper was cut into segments, immersed in fluor (3 ml, HIONIC fluor, Packard), and counted. The filter binding assay was as described above. Protein concentrations and extinction coefficients were calculated for the purified proteins by quantitation of nitrogen content by the Kjeldahl method as modified by Jaenicke (18Jaenicke L. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 61: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For routine protein measurements, the Bio-Rad dye binding assay was employed using bovine serum albumin as the standard. CD experiments were conducted using a Jasco-J710 spectropolarimeter with a Peltier type cell holder (Jasco model PTC-348W). Each wavelength spectrum scan was obtained by averaging 4–5 spectra using 1-nm intervals at 50 nm/min and a 1-mm rectangular cell. Buffer scans (25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) were accumulated and subtracted from the sample scans, and the mean residue ellipticity was calculated. CD temperature scans were performed by varying the temperature over the indicated range at a rate of 1 °C/min, and the mean ellipticity was measured at 222 nm. Experiments measuring the reversability of thermal denaturation were conducted at a rate of 2 °C/min. Because IIAChb binds to a Cu2+ chelate column, it was of interest to study the effects of divalent cations on the CD spectra and on thermal denaturation. Three metals were tested, Cu2+, Mg2+, and Ni2+. Final cation concentrations (as their chlorides) were 1 mm, whereas the proteins were used at 20–200 μm concentrations. The gene encoding IIAChb was cloned into the pET21a overexpression vector using a polymerase chain reaction approach as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The protein was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3):ΔEI harboring pET:IIAChb. A deletion of Enzyme I was used to ensure that IIAChb was isolated in its unphosphorylated form. During purification of IIAChb, it eluted as a blue solution, i.e. complexed to Cu2+, from the Cu2+ chelating column. The Cu2+ ion was removed by dialysis against buffer (typically, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0) containing 1 mmEDTA and 0.1 mm DTT. SDS-PAGE of the purified protein is shown in Fig.1 A. The protein migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 12–14 kDa, which agrees with a predicated molecular mass of 12.75 kDa from the gene sequence (7Keyhani N.O. Roseman S. Proc. Natl. Acad.

https://openalex.org/W2008632645,"Abstract Isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (IVD, EC 1.3.99.10) catalyzes the third step in the catabolism of leucine in mammals. Deficiency of this enzyme leads to the clinical disorder isovaleric acidemia. IVD has been purified and characterized from human and rat liver, and the x-ray crystallographic structure of purified recombinant human IVD has been reported. Nothing is known about IVD activity in plants, although cDNA clones from Arabidopsis thalianaand partial sequences from Gossypium hirsutum andOryza sativa have been identified as putative IVDs based on sequence homology and immuno cross-reactivity. In this report we describe the identification and characterization of an IVD from pea, purification of the enzyme using a novel and rapid auxin affinity chromatography matrix, and cloning of the corresponding gene. At the amino acid level, pea IVD is 60% similar to human and rat IVD. The specific activity and abundance of plant IVD was found to be significantly lower than for its human counterpart and exhibits developmental regulation. Substrate specificity of the plant enzyme is similar to the human IVD, and it cross-reacts to anti-human IVD antibodies. Molecular modeling of the pea enzyme based on the structure of human IVD indicates a high degree of structural similarity among these enzymes. Glu-244, shown to function as the catalytic base in human IVD along with most of the amino acids that make up the acyl CoA binding pocket, is conserved in pea IVD. The genomic structure of the plant IVD gene consists of 13 exons and 12 introns, spanning approximately 4 kilobases, and the predicted RNA splicing sites exhibit the extended consensus sequence described for other plant genes."

However, the active site amino acid in the IIB domain of theE. coli mannitol Enzyme II complex was shown to be cysteine (8Pas H.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5835-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and shortly thereafter the same result was found with the IIB domain of the glucose-specific Enzyme II complex of E. coli(9Erni B. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 63: 13-23Crossref Google Scholar). The definitive method for characterizing this novel linkage was by31P NMR spectroscopy (see “Discussion”). Sequence similarity of the amino acids around the active site in other IIB domains (10Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including IIBChb, suggests that the phosphoryl group may be linked to Cys in these proteins as well, although they have not been definitively characterized. In the present studies, homogeneous phospho-IIBChb was isolated and the phosphoryl linkage to Cys10 (the only Cys in the protein) was established by 31P NMR.A C10S mutant of IIBChb (or IIBCel) has been crystallized, and both its crystal and solution structures have been determined (11van Montford R.L.M. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 12Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Jacuinod M. Roepstorff P. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Apparently the Ser replacement was used because the Cys caused technical difficulties. As shown here, the mutant protein cannot be phosphorylated. But perhaps the most significant result reported in the present studies is that Cys10SerIIBChb forms a stable complex with phospho-IIAChb (but not with IIAChb). Further, the complex can be chemically cross-linked. It seems likely that the complex is a transition state analogue for the phosphotransfer reaction between the two native proteins. To our knowledge, there are no reports of the isolation of a transition state complex, or of an analogue of such a complex, involving a protein-protein phosphotransfer reaction.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and MethodsThe materials and biochemical and molecular biological methods are the same as described in the accompanying paper on IIAChb (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Construction of IIBChb Overexpression VectorThe open reading frame corresponding to the chbB gene was cloned into the pET21a (Novagen, Madison, WI) overexpression vector using polymerase chain reaction and primers specific to the ends of the gene. The primers were designed with unique restriction sites at each end to facilitate the cloning procedure. Polymerase chain reaction generated fragments were agarose gel purified and cloned into the pNoTA shuttle vector (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and then subsequently subcloned into pET21a using standard procedures. The nucleotide sequences of the primers are given below. The engineered restriction sites are underlined, and the start site of the gene is in bold type. A mutant version of the protein was also constructed in which the active site Cys (amino acid 10) was converted to a Ser. This was achieved by designing a primer with a mismatch in the sequence converting the codon from Cys to Ser, with the mutation given below in underlined italics.The primers used were: for chbB, 5′-GTCATATG GAAAAGAAACACATTTATCTGT-3′ (NdeI) and 5′-GTATTGATTTATGAATTCACTCTTTGACGG-3′ (EcoRI); for Cys10SerchbB, 5′-GTCATATG GAAAAGAAACACATTTATCTGTTTT C TTC-3′ (NdeI, mutation at amino acid residue 10 results from the change of a G in position 34 of the primer to a C) and the same primer as the second one listed above for chbB. The isolated subclones in pET21a were confirmed by sequencing the entire insert.Purification of IIBChbThe IIBChb proteins were purified essentially as described (12Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Jacuinod M. Roepstorff P. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Two liters each of LB media supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin in three 6-liter flasks were inoculated with 40 ml (each) of an overnight culture of E. coli strain BL21 (DE3)ΔEI (containing a deletion in Enzyme I of the PTS) harboring the plasmid pET:chbB (or pET:Cys10SerchbB). The culture was shaken vigorously at 37 °C untilA 600 = 0.8–1.0 (2–3 h) before being induced by the addition of 1 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were allowed to grow for an additional 2–3 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The following steps were conducted at 0–4 °C unless otherwise stated. The cell pellet was washed twice with TG buffer (10 mmTris, acetate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 1% glycerol, 1 mmNaN3, and 1 mm DTT) and resuspended in the same buffer using 4.0 ml/g (wet weight) of cells. After passage twice through a French Press, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were removed by high speed centrifugation at 160,000 × g for 1 h.Step 1: Mono-S-Sepharose ChromatographyThe high speed supernatant (40–50 ml, 5–10 mg protein/ml) was applied to a 2.6 × 15 cm (75 ml) Mono-S-Sepharose column equilibrated in TG buffer, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, after which the column was washed overnight with TG buffer before being eluted with a 1-liter gradient of 0–300 mm NaCl in TG buffer. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The protein eluted between 100 and 150 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 5–10 ml (10–20 mg protein/ml) using Centriprep-3 centrifugal filter devices (Millipore).Step 2: Sephadex G-50 Gel Filtration ChromatographyA Sephadex G-50 column (2.6 × 82 cm) was equilibrated with TG buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The pooled, concentrated fractions from Step 1 were transferred to the column and eluted with the same buffer. Protein fractions were pooled based on purity as determined by SDS-PAGE. The purified protein was concentrated as described above (to 5–10 mg/ml) and dialyzed against 25 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Wild type protein was dialyzed against the same buffer containing 0.2 mm DTT. Purified protein aliquots were stored at −70 °C until used.Phosphorylation AssayThe assay was performed as described (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) for the phosphorylation of IIAChb. For measurement of IIBChbphosphorylation, the assay reaction mixture contained (20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm NaF, 2–5 pmol of purified Enzyme I, 5–10 pmol of purified HPr, 2–10 pmol of purified IIAChb, and 100–1000 pmol of purified IIBChb. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 0.2–2 nmol of [32P]PEP (10–20 cpm/pmol). Aliquots were taken over the time course, and the reaction was stopped by dilution with 1.0 ml of ice-cold buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and filtered through polyvinylidene difluoride filters (Sartorius). The filters were washed twice with 1 ml of the same buffer, immersed in 4 ml of Packard Ultima-Gold XR liquid scintillation counter mixture, and counted in a Packard Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. Control incubation mixtures lacked either Enzyme I, HPr, or IIAChb.Isolation of Phospho-IIBChbPhosphorylation reactions were carried out in a buffer containing 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 mm DTT. Amounts of purified IIBChb ranging from 50 nmol to 3.0 μmol were phosphorylated with Enzyme I, HPr, and IIAChb at molar ratios from 1:100 to 1:200 relative to the IIBChb. Reactions were initiated by adding a 30-fold molar excess (with respect to IIBChb) of PEP and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min, after which an additional 10-fold molar excess of PEP was added and the reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min. The phospho-IIBChb was purified either by native gel electrophoresis and electroelution of the appropriate segment of the gel or by purification on a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (fast protein liquid chromatography) as described below.Kinetics of Hydrolysis of Phosphoprotein as a Function of pHThe rate of hydrolysis of [32P]phospho-IIBChb was determined as a function of pH at 25 °C. The following buffers were used: McIlvaine's sodium phosphate-citric acid broad range buffer from pH 2.0 to 8.8, Bates and Bowers boric acid-KCl buffer (pH 8.0–10), sodium phosphate, sodium acetate, sodium borate, Tris-HCl, MOPS-HCl, and TAPS-HCl. At each pH, the kinetics of hydrolysis were determined using the DEAE-paper method for separating [32P]Pifrom [32P]phospho-IIBChb (13Weigel N. Kukuruzinska M.A. Nakazawa A. Waygood E.B. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14477-14491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and initial rates were determined to calculate the respective rate constants.Detection, Isolation, and Analysis of a Complex between Phospho-IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChbThe mutant IIBChb protein could not be phosphorylated, as expected. However, when stoichiometric amounts of phospho-IIAChb were added to the mutant protein, a complex was detected using native gel electrophoresis (see “Results”). Two methods were developed to purify the complex.Electroelution from Native GelEquimolar amounts of IIAChb and IIBChb were incubated with Enzyme I and HPr at 1:250 the molar concentrations of IIAChb and IIBChb. Reactions were initiated by adding a 40-fold excess of PEP and allowed to incubate for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were electrophoresed in a 16% polyacrylamide gels under native conditions, and the protein band corresponding to the complex was electroeleuted from the gel.Superdex-75 Gel FiltrationA two-step procedure was employed to purify the complex. First, IIAChb was phosphorylated and purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex-75 (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) fast protein liquid chromatography column and system. The column was equilibrated and eluted with 25 mm sodium phosphate pH 8.0 buffer. The protein concentration in the pooled fractions containing the purifed phospho-IIAChb was estimated byA 280 and a 1.1-fold excess Cys10SerIIBChb was added to the phosphoprotein. The mixture was maintained at room temperature for 15–20 min before being transferred to a Superdex-75 gel filtration column. The three proteins (IIBChb, IIAChb, and the complex) could easily be separated on the column (see “Results”).Cross-linking ExperimentsPhosphorylation reactions were performed in 25 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, buffer containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 0.2 mm DTT. Typical reaction mixtures (10 μl) contained equimolar amounts (0.7–1.4 nmol) of IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb, 5–10 pmol of Enzyme I, 5–10 pmol of HPr, and 20–50 nmol of PEP. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to the addition of the cross-linking reagent (20–30-fold excess) and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 30–60 min. Unless otherwise indicated, reactions were quenched by adding 1 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated for an additional 5 min at room temperature. SDS loading buffer (5 μl) was then added, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The following cross-linking reagents (Pierce) were tested:bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3), 1-ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, dimethyladipimidate, dimethylsuberimidate, disuccinimidyl tartrate, dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate), and 3,3′-dithiobis(sulfosuccinimidyl proprionate) (DTSSP). Stock solutions (10–25 mm) of BS3, dimethyladipimidate, dimethylsuberimidate, and DTSSP were prepared in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and solutions of disuccinimidyl tartrate and dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) were prepared in Me2SO. For reactions containing the cross-linkers dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) and DTSSP, DTT was omitted from all buffers and solutions. 1-Ethyl-3-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide reaction mixtures were quenched using 2-mercaptoethanol (final concentration, 10 mm) instead of Tris-HCl buffer.Analysis of DTSSP Cross-linked ProductA 10-fold scaled up cross-linking reaction was performed as described above using DTSSP as the cross-linking reagent. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 12 nmol of IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb, 50 pmol of Enzyme I, 50 pmol of HPr, and 50 nmol of PEP in buffer (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm MgCl2). The sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to a 26-kDa molecular mass protein was electroeluted from the gel. After electroelution a portion of the sample (100 μl) was treated with DTT (10 mm) for 30 min and then dialyzed against (100 ml) 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, prior to SDS-PAGE analysis.31P NMR SpectroscopyThe NMR experiments were kindly performed by Dr. Charles Long (Department of Chemistry, Johns Hopkins University). A large scale sample (3.0 μmol) of IIBChb was phosphorylated and purified as described above. The final purified sample was concentrated to 1.0 ml (2.5 mm, 83% yield) and exchanged with 80% D2O. The sample was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube, and a 5-mm broad band 31P probe was used for all measurements. NMR spectra were recorded on a 500-MHz Varian Unity Plus spectrometer operating at 202 Mhz (31P frequency), using a 10-μs (53°) pulse and a repetition time of 3.2 s. Protons were decoupled by broad band decoupling. All spectra were recorded at 10 °C, pH 8.2–8.8 (calculated to be pH 8.6). Chemical shifts are reported relative to an external standard of 85% phosphoric acid, which was set to 0.0 ppm, and repeatedly checked for drift.DISCUSSIONAlthough the solution and crystal structures of the mutant protein Cys10SerIIBChb have been established (11van Montford R.L.M.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and IIBChb has been isolated, there are no reports on the properties of phospho-IIBChb. As demonstrated by analytical sedimentation (3Keyhani N.O. Rodgers M. Demeler B. Hansen J. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33110-33115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), IIBChb and phospho-IIBChbare monomeric, unlike both IIAChb and phospho-IIAChb, which form stable dimers. In addition, we show that phosphate transfer proceeds as depicted in Fig. 1, from PEP through Enzyme I, HPr to IIAChb to IIBChb, and finally to (GlcNAc)2, the last step mediated by the membrane receptor, IICChb. Kinetic and thermodynamic studies on the reversible transfer of the phosphoryl group between IIAChb and IIBChb are now in progress.Early work on phospho-PTS proteins established that the phosphoryl group was generally linked to a histidine. However, in 1988 Pas and Robillard (8Pas H.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5835-5839Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 24Pas H.H. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported a unique linkage, a thiophosphate, in a phosphoryl-polypeptide isolated from the IIB domain of IIMtl. The thiophosphoryl linkage was subsequently reported in the IIB domain of IICBGlc (22Meins M. Jenö P. Müller D. Richter W.J. Rosenbusch J.P. Erni B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11604-11609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in the IIB domain of the Staphylococcus carnosus Enzyme IIMtl(18Pogge von Strandmann R. Weigt C. Fischer R. Meyer H.E. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequence similarities also suggested that Cys is the active site amino acid in a number of IIB domains. The thiophosphoryl linkage has also been found in a different family of enzymes, protein-tyrosine phosphatases (23Guan K.L. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17026-17030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), where they act as catalytic intermediates in the overall hydrolysis reaction (19Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 20Denu J.M. Lohse D.L. Vijayalakshmi J. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2493-2498Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).The phosphoryl group in phospho-IIBChb was presumed to be linked to Cys10 (25van Montford, R. L. M., Pijning, T., Kalk, K. H., Schuurman-Wolters, G. K., Reizer, J., Saier, M. H., Robillard, G., and Dijkstra, B. W. (1994) J. Mol. Biol., 239, -588.Google Scholar) based on sequence similarity. In the present studies, phospho-IIBChb was isolated in homogeneous form, and the linkage was shown to be a thiophosphate by31P NMR; IIBChb contains only one Cys. IIBChb offers a unique advantage for these experiments because it is a separately encoded protein. Thus, NMR can be directly applied without resorting to protease digestion and the isolation of a phosphopeptide and therefore without the danger of an artifactual result because of phosphoryl migration.For structural and other experiments on phospho-IIBChb, it was necessary to determine its stability. Like butyl thiophosphate (21Herr Jr., E.B. Koshland D.E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 25: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), the curve of hydrolysis rate versus pH is bell-shaped, but whereas butyl thiophosphate shows maximum instability at pH ∼3–4, phospho-IIBChb shows maximum instability at pH ∼8. This behavior is different from thiophosphopeptides isolated from other IIB domains and from that of a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, all of which more closely resemble butyl thiophosphate. The most likely explanation for this large difference in behavior of the thiophosphate group in phospho-IIBChb are neighboring group effects. It should be noted that IIBChb is a very basic protein, with a calculated pI of 8.0. Furthermore, two crystal structures have been solved, one a protein-tyrosine phosphate phosphatase mutant with the thiophosphoryl group intact (26Pannifer A.D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10454-10462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the second the corresponding native enzyme from Yersinia liganded to tungstate (in place of covalent phosphate) (27Stuckey J.A. Schubert H.L. Fauman E.B. Zhang Z.Y. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). In both cases, the structures show that a conformationally flexible loop closes over the phosphate (or tungstate), thereby increasing the number of amino acid side chains surrounding the phosphoryl moiety. The 31P NMR results obtained here with phospho-IIBChb are also consistent with the idea of strong neighboring groups interactions, because the 16.3 ppm downfield shift at pH 8.6 was significantly greater than in the other thiophosphoryl proteins and was similar to that of the leukocyte tyrosine phosphatase phosphoprotein, where the chemical shift was +16.1 in 0.2 n NaOH (19Cho H. Krishnaraj R. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Walsh C.T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 7296-7298Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In other words, the phosphoryl group in phospho-IIBChb may be completely ionized at pH 8.6. In this connection, it should be noted that the pK a of the thiophosphoryl group in the IIB domain of S. carnosus could not be measured in the pH range 3.9–8.4 (18Pogge von Strandmann R. Weigt C. Fischer R. Meyer H.E. Kalbitzer H.R. Hengstenberg W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 233: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar), and von Strandmann et al. concluded that the pK swas likely to be <2.5 and that the phosphoryl group is doubly charged over a very broad pH range. There were no pH stability studies reported on this thiophosphoryl domain, and additionally, the IIB domain was subcloned with a His6 tag to aid in the purification. Conceivably, the latter could influence the pK a of the phosphoryl group in this protein.The most unexpected result of the present studies, was to find that phospho-IIAChb and the mutant protein Cys10SerIIBChb form a stable complex, stable, that is, to gel filtration column chromatography, native gel electrophoresis, and analytical ultracentrifugation (some dissociation was noted). The complex was dissociated to its components by SDS-PAGE, and they were present in equimolar quantities in the complex as determined by densitometric scanning of the gels. The latter result does not distinguish between two possibilities, phospho-IIAChb/IIBChb and (phospho-IIAChb/IIBChb)2, respectively, but the sedimentation studies show that it is a tetramer.The complex was cross-linked with BS3, shown schematically in Fig. 7. The complex and the cross-linked complex are, we believe, analogues of a transition state complex that occur as an intermediate in the phosphotransfer reaction between IIAChb and IIBChb. Insofar as we are aware, no such transition state analogues involving protein-protein phosphotransfer reactions have been reported. Attempts are now in progress to crystallize the cross-linked analogue.

Intramolecular transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) effects between the monosaccharide moieties were used to derive the ligand conformation in the lectin-bound state. Ligand protons in contact with the protein were identified by saturation transfer difference experiments and intermolecular transferred NOE effects. It is demonstrated that structural differences exist for the ligand-lectin complex in aqueous solution as compared with the previously published crystal structure (Lee, X., Thompson, A., Zhiming, Z., Ton-that, H., Biesterfeldt, J., Ogata, C., Xu, L., Johnston, R. A. Z., and Young, N. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 6312–6318). In order to accommodate the O-methyl group of the disaccharide, the amino acid side chain of Tyr-122 has to rotate from its position in the crystal. The NMR data are in accord with two conformational families at the β-(1→3)glycosidic linkage in the solution complex with interglycosidic angles φ/ψ = 45/−65° and −65/−18°. These differ from the bound conformation of the ligand in the crystal (φ/ψ = 39/−8°) and are not highly populated by the ligand in the free state. The reason for the structural differences at the β-(1→3)glycosidic linkage are hydrogen bonds that stabilize the relative orientation of the monosaccharide units in the crystal.

The reducing GalNAc moiety resides in the binding site of the lectin, closely surrounded by four aromatic amino acids (Phe-47, Tyr-78, Tyr-122, and Trp-123) that form a hydrophobic pocket around the ligand. The N-acetyl group as well as the Gal unit are not in direct contact with the protein. With the exception of one Asp side chain, the H-bonds to the ligand all involve atoms of the peptide backbone or water molecules. This recognition of the reducing sugar unit seems to be a specific feature of the lectins from the Moraceae family since the closely related jacalin binds methyl-α-d-galactopyranoside in the same way as MPA the α-GalNAc unit of 2 (9Sankaranarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, many other lectins known so far recognize oligosaccharide ligands through their terminal carbohydrate residues.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the crystal structure of the MPA·T-antigen complex the Gal residue, although not in direct contact with the protein, is held in position through water-mediated H-bonds from the hydroxyl group at C-6′ to Thr-79 and Asp-125 of the lectin and additional water-mediated H-bonds from the hydroxyl groups at C-2′ and C-3′ to the carbonyl oxygen of Glu-76 of the neighboring tetramer in the crystal. The resulting conformation at the glycosidic linkage resembles a low energy conformation of the ligand. Since the water-mediated H-bonds to the neighboring tetramer are crystal-specific and bulk water molecules compete with the water-mediated H-bonds from C-6′ to Thr-79 and Asp-125, these stabilizing H-bonds are not likely to play a role in solution. This opens up the question of how these H-bonds influence the structural characteristics of the disaccharide-lectin complex in the crystal compared with the situation in aqueous solution. To gain further insight into the MPA·T-antigen complex in aqueous solution, we have used NMR spectroscopy that offers different experimental approaches to address the above questions. High resolution1H NMR has shown to be an ideal tool to study protein-bound ligands in fast exchange with the protein. In particular, the transferred NOE (trNOE) methodology yields information about proton-proton distances in the bound ligand, from which the conformation of the ligand in the bound state can be determined (10Ni F.

Engl. 1999; 38: 1784-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) provides additional information about ligand protons in contact with the protein. Although saturation transfer is a well known NMR phenomenon, within STD experiments it offers a convenient tool to map protein-ligand contacts in solution. M. pomifera agglutinin was prepared as described previously (14Young N.M. Johnston R.A.Z. Szabo A.G. Watson D.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 270: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For the NMR experiments, the protein was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline/D2O (10 mm phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pD 7.4) and repeatedly concentrated and diluted in Centricon concentrators (Amicon) with phosphate-buffered saline/D2O buffer. The NMR sample finally contained 2.14 mg of protein (∼126 nmol binding sites) and 0.6 mg (1.52 mmol) of disaccharide 3 yielding a protein-to-ligand ratio of 1:12. All spectra were acquired on a DRX500 spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a triple probe and a Z gradient. Chemical shifts are reported relative to internal 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid. trNOE and Quiet-trNOE (15Vincent S.J.F. Zwahlen C. Post C.B. Burgner J.W. Bodenhausen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

A pulsed field gradient (∼10 G/cm, 3 ms) before the read pulse was used to defocus unwanted transversal magnetization. Quiet-trNOE experiments used an I-BURP (18Geen H. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 93-141Google Scholar) inversion pulse (3.5 ms) to invert the region between 3 and 5.5 ppm in the middle of the mixing time. trROE (19Perlman M.E. Davis D.G. Koszalka G.W. Tuttle J.V. London R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7547-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) experiments (100 and 250 ms spin lock, 2048 data points × 512 increments × 16 transitions) were performed with the standard ROESY pulse sequence. Residual water was suppressed during the recycle delay and the mixing time. Two-dimensional data were zero-filled to give a 4096 × 1024 data matrix prior to Fourier transformation that used a squared cosine function for apodization. One-dimensional STD NMR spectra used a train of ∼270° gaussian-shaped selective pulses (80 ms each) to saturate selectively (∼2 s) regions of the spectrum. Protein resonances were saturated at 7 ppm (aromatic region). The off-resonance saturation for the reference spectrum was performed at 24 ppm. Subtraction of the protein-saturated and the reference spectrum was performed within the phase cycle. Integration of the spectra was performed with Xwinnmr (Bruker). The raw data were normalized against the decay of the signal H-4 that was fitted to an exponentially decaying function and extrapolated back to an intensity of 100% at zero mixing time. The curves for the trNOEs H-1′—H-3 and H-1′—H-4 were than fitted to an exponential function of the form f(t) = A × (1 − exp(−b × t)) with A and −b being adjustable parameters. The initial slope of this curve determined from the first derivative of the function (f′ (0) = A × b) was used to calculate experimental distances with the isolated spin-pair approximation using the trNOE H-1—H-2 and a corresponding distance of 2.43 Å as reference. To compare the NMR-derived structure of the ligand with the crystal structure, protons had to be added to the protein data base structure (Protein Data Base code 1jot). This and further modeling was done with Sybyl 6.2 (Tripos). The MMC Simulation (20Peters T. Meyer B. Stuike-Prill R. Somorjai R. Brisson J.-R. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 238: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) was performed with gegop 2.7 (21Stuike-Prill R. Meyer B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 194: 903-919Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. To reach all accessible conformations of the disaccharide, the MMC simulation was performed with 2 × 106 Monte Carlo steps and a temperature factor of 2000 K. A Fortran program searched all accepted conformations to find the ones that fulfilled the experimentally derived distances for the trNOEs H-1′—H-3 and H-1′—H-4. Glycosidic torsional angles are defined using the protons as φ (H-1′—C-1′—O-1-C-x), ψ (C-1′–O-1–C-x−H-x) and ω (O-6—C-6—C-5—O-5), with x being the aglyconic site. In the T-antigen structure, disaccharide 2 is α-glycosidically linked to the peptide backbone. From an NMR spectroscopic point of view, the reducing disaccharide 2used for the crystal structure (1Lee X. Thompson A. Zhiming Z. Ton-that H. Biesterfeldt J. Ogata C. Xu L. Johnston R.A.Z. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) shows two sets of resonances, one for the α- and one for the β-configuration of the ligand. For this NMR investigation we have therefore used the T-antigen disaccharide as the α-methylglycoside3. 2R. Bukowski and T. Weimar, manuscript in preparation. The methyl group in 3 substitutes for the linkage to the amino acid serine or threonine and thus serves as a probe to determine protein-ligand interactions at the reducing end of the disaccharide. A titration of the lectin with ligand was performed to find the protein-to-ligand ratio giving intense trNOEs and a good signal-to-noise ratio. This yielded a protein-to-ligand ratio of 1:12, which was also used for all NMR experiments. To verify the binding mode of the T-antigen disaccharide bound by MPA in aqueous solution, one-dimensional STD experiments are the method of choice since this type of NMR experiments creates a map of proton resonances of the ligand which are accessible for the protein. The STD experiment makes use of the effective magnetization transfer (spin diffusion) of the slow tumbling protein and complex to point out ligand protons in close proximity to protein protons during the time the ligand spends in the complex. During the experiment, protein resonances are saturated at a position in the spectrum where no ligand resonances appear and part of this magnetization is transferred to the ligand in the binding site. After subtraction of a reference spectrum, with the frequency of the saturation pulse set far away from all resonances, the STD spectrum remaining shows only ligand resonances in contact to the protein (Fig.1 B). Since only the resonances from the GalNAc moiety and H-1 from Gal are significantly above the noise level in the STD spectrum, this experiment supports the binding mode of the crystal structure. A closer inspection of the crystal structure (1Lee X. Thompson A. Zhiming Z. Ton-that H. Biesterfeldt J. Ogata C. Xu L. Johnston R.A.Z. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) reveals that the proton H-5′ of the ligand in the crystal has a distance of only 2.58 Å to the ε-proton of Tyr-78. This should allow an effective magnetization transfer to proton H-5′ but the actual enhancement is, at best, very weak. This fact points to a deviation of the ligand conformation in solution from the crystal structure (compare below). Like many lectins, MPA has a specific but low affinity for ligands, here α-galactose-containing carbohydrates (22Sarkar M. Wu A.M. Kabat E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 209: 204-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For the ligand molecule, this leads to a fast exchange between the protein-bound state and the free state permitting the observation of trNOEs. Often only trNOEs involving the proton resonances of the ligand molecule are observable; however, for the complex investigated here we also observed intermolecular trNOE effects between protein and ligand resonances (Fig. 1 D). This is attributed to the fact that MPA has a moderate size (68 kDa as a tetramer), and therefore, some individual resonances of protein protons are relatively narrow and could thus be observed in a two-dimensional spectrum. As can be seen from Fig. 1 D, intermolecular trNOEs are found between aromatic amino acid protons, and all ligand protons that show an enhancement in the STD spectrum. Thus major mediators for the magnetization transfer from the protein to the ligand are the aromatic residues in the binding site of the lectin. These amino acid residues (Phe-47, Tyr-78, Tyr-122, and Trp-123) form a hydrophobic pocket around the GalNAc unit and provide favorable van-der-Waals interactions to the ligand in the binding site (1Lee X. Thompson A. Zhiming Z. Ton-that H. Biesterfeldt J. Ogata C. Xu L. Johnston R.A.Z. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). On the basis of the crystal structure of the complex, some of the aromatic residues could be assigned (see Table I). Based on the contact to H-2 an unequivocal assignment for the δ and ε proton resonances of Phe-47 was possible. Unfortunately, the other cross-peaks could only be assigned to the amino acid residues. Particularly for Tyr-78, which provides a stacking interaction to the GalNAc moiety, the δ and ε resonances seem to be degenerate since H-3, H-4, H-5, H-6, H-1′, and the O-methyl group give a cross-peak to resonances at 6.93 ppm. Analogous to the STD experiments no intermolecular trNOEs involving proton H-5′ of the disaccharide are observed. The reason for the discrepancies involving H-5′ will become clear when the conformation of the ligand in the bound state is derived in the following.Table IProposed assignment of some aromatic amino acid resonances of MPA based on the crystal coordinates of the lectin with 2 (1Lee X.

Open table in a new tab Intramolecular trNOEs of ligand resonances, especially across the glycosidic linkage, provide information about the conformation of the bound disaccharide in aqueous solution. Two intense interglycosidic trNOEs, namely H-1′—H-3 and H-1′—H-4, and a very weak effect H-1′—H-5 can be observed (Figs.1 C and 2). Given ther −6 dependence of the NOE effect from the distance between the protons, the integrals of H-1′—H-3 and H-1′—H-4 translated into almost the same experimental internuclear distance. By using the two-spin approximation, we calculated 2.65 and 2.75 Å for the distance between H-1′ and H-3 or H-4, respectively. In the crystal structure of the disaccharide complexed by MPA (φ/ψ = 39/−8°) these interproton distances are 2.05 and 3.7 Å (1Lee X. Thompson A. Zhiming Z. Ton-that H. Biesterfeldt J. Ogata C. Xu L. Johnston R.A.Z. Young N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6312-6318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus an interglycosidic trNOE H-1′—H-4 would not be observable in this conformation of the disaccharide. Such a discrepancy can either be caused by a indirect magnetization transfer (spin diffusion) or a variation of the conformation at the interglycosidic linkage. Although it is very unlikely that a strong trNOE such as H–1′—H-4 arises entirely through spin diffusion, we performed trROE (19Perlman M.E. Davis D.G. Koszalka G.W. Tuttle J.V. London R.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7547-7559Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and Quiet-trNOE (15Vincent S.J.F. Zwahlen C. Post C.B. Burgner J.W. Bodenhausen G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4383-4388Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Haselhorst T. Espinosa J.-F. Jiménez-Barbero J. Sokolowski T. Kosma P. Brade H. Brade L. Peters T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6449-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) experiments (data not shown) which gave no indication for a indirect magnetization transfer being responsible for this trNOE. For the small interglycosidic trNOE H-1′—H-5, as well as for all other very weak effects, the situation is different. These effects had an integral much smaller than 1% at 350-ms mixing time, and the control experiments identified them to be spin diffusion artifacts. Therefore, the trNOE H-1′—H-5 does not has any value for the structure elucidation of the bound disaccharide. From the trNOE data it is therefore obvious that the experimental distances for the trNOEs H-1′—H-4 and H-1′—H-3 in fact point to conformational differences of the bound disaccharide in aqueous solution as compared with the crystal structure. By using the experimentally derived distances between the protons H-1′ and H-3, respectively H-4, we aimed to define the bound conformation of the disaccharide in aqueous solution with an MMC simulation (20Peters T. Meyer B. Stuike-Prill R. Somorjai R. Brisson J.-R. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 238: 49-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Such a simulation for the disaccharide was performed with a temperature factor of 2000 K. Although this simulation gave a relative distribution of conformational families that differed slightly from the distribution at ambient temperature,2 the elevated temperature factor enables the simulation to reach all accessible conformations of the disaccharide. Based on this MMC simulation, all conformations resembling the experimentally derived data were searched and are displayed in a population plot in Fig. 3. For this the distances between H-1′—H-3 and H-1′—H-4 were defined to be in a range of 2.4–3.0 and 2.5–3.1 Å, respectively. These ranges took into consideration the inaccuracy of the experimental data and of the two-spin approximation. In Fig. 3 the conformations that satisfied these distance ranges are overlaid with the population plot of3. Depending on the range of distances used, slightly narrower or wider regions of the population plot were found to be in accord with the experimental data, but the general shape of the highlighted region did not change. Fig. 3 clearly shows that the bound conformation of the disaccharide in aqueous solution was not identical to the bound conformation in the crystal structure. Additionally, two conformational families were in accord with the experimental distances, and these conformational families did not belong to regions that are highly populated by the unbound disaccharide in solution. The two conformations that satisfied the experimental restraints best (φ/ψ = 45/−65° and −65/−18°) are displayed in Fig. 4. It is interesting that the protons H-1′, H-3, and H-4 are in the same relative position in these two conformations and that both conformations seem to be populated by the uncomplexed disaccharide with approximately the same probability (compare Fig. 3). Modeling of the complex based on the crystal structure did not reveal forbidden contacts with the protein that would exclude one of these conformations. Moreover, these conformations place proton H-5′ in distances between 3.0 and 4.7 Å to the δ- and ε-protons of Tyr-78 which readily explained why a very weak STD effect but no intermolecular trNOE was observed. Unfortunately, the observed experimental effects did not allow us to decide whether one of the two conformations or a range of conformations is selected by MPA in solution. A further point to address is the conformation of the α-linkedO-methyl group in the complex. In the crystal structure with MPA the reducing oxygen of 2 (at 2.2-Å resolution no hydrogen atoms are resolved) in the α-position of GalNAc points directly toward the aromatic ring system of Tyr-122. In this arrangement the structure does not allow the accommodation of a methyl group or a linkage to the amino acids serine or threonine. Intermolecular trNOEs and STD effects (Fig. 1) indicated a short distance between the O-methyl protons of 3 and Tyr-122 and Tyr-78 of MPA in solution. Thus, in the bound form of3 the methyl group has the same protein environment as the hydroxyl group of 2 in the crystal structure. There was also a strong intramolecular trNOEs from the O-methyl group to H-1 and small effects to all other protons of the GalNAc moiety; the latter could be shown to be spin diffusion artifacts by means of trROE and Quiet-trNOE experiments. From this we concluded that the φ-angle of the GalNAc unit in the complex has a small negative value (between approximately −20° and approximately −60°) because such an orientation satisfied the trNOE to H-1 and is in accord with theexo-anomeric effect. Support for this assumption came from the closely related crystal structure of jacalin with methyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (9Sankaranarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), where four carbohydrate ligands in four binding sites of the tetrameric lectin also display φ angles in the range between −24 and −73°. We have, therefore, used a φ angle of −25° for the models presented in Figs. 4 and5. Independent of the exact torsional angle φ, the O-methyl group always clashed into the aromatic ring of Tyr-122 when the crystal coordinates of MPA were used (Fig. 5). A torsional angle Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ of Tyr-122 of −48° is responsible for this steric hindrance. In the crystal structure, this angle yields favorable interactions between the aromatic ring and the reducing α-hydroxyl group of 2 but places the aromatic ring too close to the carbohydrate to accommodate theO-methyl group of 3. Jacalin has the same amino acid arrangement around the binding site as MPA but in the complex with methyl α-d-galactopyranoside the torsional angle Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ of the four Tyr-122 residues have values between 10° and 30°. Such a torsional angle also opens up a cleft on the protein surface between Tyr-78 and Tyr-122 so that theO-methyl group in the α-position of Gal or GalNAc can be accommodated in the binding site and, additionally, provides hydrophobic and van-der-Waals interactions to the methyl group. We therefore propose the torsional angle Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ for Tyr-122 in the complex of MPA with 3 to be between 10 and 30°, as used in the presentation of Fig. 5. Is the crystal structure of the T-antigen·MPA complex also representative for the recognition of the ligand by the lectin in aqueous solution? We have demonstrated here that the answer has to be divided into two parts. The general recognition of the ligand,i.e. the manner the α-GalNAc unit of the disaccharide is bound by the lectin and the arrangement of the aromatic amino acids around the ligand in the binding site, is verified by STD and trNOE experiments. These experiments prove that the aromatic amino acids are in close vicinity to the ligand either by direct saturation transfer from protein to ligand or by intermolecular trNOE effects between ligand and protein. From our experiments there is no doubt that the GalNAc moiety in aqueous solution is in fact in the same position as in the crystal. On the other hand the NMR experiments uncover structural differences between crystal and solution. The interpretation of the trNOE data demonstrates that the water-mediated hydrogen bonds observed in the crystal structure between hydroxyl protons of the Gal unit and the protein are crystal-specific and artificially stabilize the β-(1→3) linkage to GalNAc in a low energy conformation. In solution, when these H bonds are absent, the lectin recognizes one or more conformational families of the ligand that are not highly populated by the free ligand. Although our NMR data give no indication whether a single conformation or a mixture of the two conformational families are bound by the lectin, the advantage for the selection of a range of conformations would be a smaller loss of entropy and, hence, a larger free enthalpy gain during complex formation. Preliminary thermodynamic investigations of different complexes of MPA are in accord with a flexible model of ligand recognition. Our investigation also provides strong evidence for flexibility of the protein during the recognition of the ligand. The aromatic ring of Tyr-122 has to move from its position in the crystal structure complex with 2 in order to accommodate the O-methyl group of 3. The cleft which opens up when the torsional angle Cα-Cβ-Cγ-Cδ is around 20° should also provide enough space for the glycosidic linkage to the peptide backbone of T-antigen structures like 1. Carbohydrate recognition, like many other biological processes, takes place in solution or the interface between solution and a surface,i.e. membranes. This report demonstrates that NMR spectroscopy is an important tool to validate and improve crystal structures of biomolecular complexes by taking the solution environment into account. Since it is important for the general understanding of carbohydrate recognition whether and how the mobility of amino acid side chains such as Tyr-122 on the protein surface influences the ligand recognition of MPA, we have started long time molecular dynamics simulations of MPA·T-antigen complexes in water. These simulations should also help to decide whether a single or a range of conformations of the ligand is selected by MPA.

A model is presented that describes the concerted assembly and disassembly of IIAChb-IIBChb complexes contingent on phosphorylation-dependent conformational changes, especially of IIAChb. phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system β-1,4-linked oligomers of GlcNAc wheren = 2–6 The phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS)1 consists of two soluble general proteins, Enzyme I and HPr, required for the uptake of all PTS sugars. These proteins are coupled to substrate-specific permeases or transporters that are ultimately responsible for the concomitant uptake and phosphorylation of carbohydrate substrates. Phosphorylation proceeds sequentially, beginning with the autophosphorylation of Enzyme I by phosphoenolpyruvate. A frequent sequence is as follows: phospho-Enzyme I donates its phosphate to HPr, phospho-HPr to sugar-specific IIA proteins, phospho-IIA to IIB, and phospho-IIB in conjunction with the membrane receptor, IIC, phosphorylates and transports the substrate. The structure and oligomeric state(s) of both Enzyme I and HPr have been extensively studied (for reviews see Refs.6Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev.

Several sugar-specific PTS transporters have also been well characterized, including the Escherichia coli glucose and mannitol transporters. To date, however, there have been few reports on the oligomeric states of the sugar-specific proteins, particularly in their phosphorylated states. Furthermore, although phosphate is transferred from one protein to another as summarized above, there have been no reports describing the isolation of a transition state intermediate or stable complex between two reacting PTS proteins.In the accompanying papers (1Keyhani N.O.

The phosphoryl transfer reaction sequence resulting in the uptake of (GlcNAc)2 was studied, and the soluble proteins IIAChb, IIBChb, and an active site mutant (C10S), of IIBChb were purified to apparent homogeneity. A phosphoryl group is transferred from phospho-HPr to IIAChb and from phospho-IIAChb to IIBChb. Phospho-IIAChb was found to be 5–10-fold more stable than homologous phospho-IIA proteins. This stability, as well as that of phospho-IIBChb, enabled us to use analytical ultracentrifugation to determine the oligomeric states of IIAChb and IIBChb in both their unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms and of an analogue of a potential transition state intermediate in the phosphotransfer reaction between the proteins.DISCUSSIONThere are only a few studies on the hydrodynamic properties of the sugar-specific PTS proteins, and insofar as we know, none on the corresponding phosphoproteins (6Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, analytical sedimentation, both velocity and equilibrium, were used to characterize the following proteins of theN,N′-diacetylchitobiose transport system: IIAChb, phospho-IIAChb, IIBChb, phospho-IIBChb, a mutant Cys10SerIIBChb), and an apparent complex between phospho-IIAChb and the mutant protein. The latter is a likely candidate as a transition state analogue in the phosphotransfer reaction between IIAChb and IIBChb.IIAChb has considerable amino acid sequence similarity to IIALac, part of the lactose PTS permease in Gram-positive organisms; IIAChb is 33% identical to IIALacof Staphylococcus aureus and 35% identical to the same protein from Lactococcus lactis (7Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the latter protein reveals that it is 83% α-helix (16Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas in the accompanying paper (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) we report that IIAChbis 75–85% helix. Nevertheless, IIAChb is very different from IIALac. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments (17Hays J.B. Simoni R.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 941-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly established that IIALac forms a stable trimer, whereas the results reported here show that IIAChb forms a very stable dimer. Because no monomer was detected, the dissociation constant for the dimer would have to be less than 10−7m (15Ralston G.B. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA1993: 5-6Google Scholar).Further, there are other major differences between phospho-IIALac and phospho-IIAChb. IIALac is thought to dissociate when it is phosphorylated (18Deutscher J. Beyreuther K. Sobek H.M. Stüber K. Hengstenberg W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4867-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No monomeric phospho-IIAChb was detected in the sedimentation experiments reported here.Although they have the same molecular weight, the sedimentation coefficient of phospho-IIAChb was 10–15% less than that of IIAChb, suggesting that phosphorylation yielded a significantly less compact protein. These results agree with those obtained from the CD spectra, where it appeared that at 37 °C, phospho-IIAChb loses ∼35% of the helicity of IIAChb (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was much more sensitive to thermal denaturation. The effects of protein concentration both on the stability to hydrolysis of the phosphoprotein and on its thermal denaturation suggested that the phosphodimer dissociates to phosphomonomer, but this effect was only apparent at 37 °C and above. The sedimentation experiments were conducted at temperatures ∼20 °C because significant hydrolysis of the phosphoprotein does occur over prolonged periods at the higher temperatures. The sedimentation velocity data indicate a change ins 20,w for IIAChb but not for phospho-IIAChb as a function of temperature (Table I). Because no change in extent of dimerization is observed, this result suggests an important change in shape and/or hydration with temperature. We are currently investigating this observation in greater detail.The solution and crystal structures of the mutant protein Cys10SerIIBChb have been described (19van Montford R.L.M. Pijning T.

Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but there are no reports on the properties of IIBChb nor phospho-IIBChb. The sedimentation results presented here show that: (a) IIBChb, phospho-IIBChb, and Cys10SerIIBChb each behaves as a single monomeric species. (b) IIBChb and the mutant Cys10SerIIBChb exhibited identical sedimentation behavior, therefore suggesting that this mutation causes no significant change in structure (as reflected in the hydrodynamic properties). In contrast to IIAChb, where phosphorylation resulted in a lower sedimentation coefficient, phospho-IIBChb exhibited a significantly higher coefficient than IIBChb, implying that the phosphoprotein may be more compact than unphosphorylated IIBChb. (Similar effects can result from changes in hydration and/or shape.) As discussed elsewhere in these papers (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), phospho-IIBChb is a thiophosphoryl protein, analogous to protein-tyrosine phosphate phosphatases. In the latter, phosphorylation at the active site Cys causes a conformationally flexible loop in the peptide chain to close over the phosphoryl group, which conceivably would yield a more compact protein with a higher sedimentation coefficient. Finally, it should also be noted that IIBChbis a basic protein (pI about 8.0) and that the phosphoryl group may interact with basic groups in the protein, thereby resulting in a more compact structure than IIBChb.When phospho-IIAChb was mixed with an equimolar quantity of Cys10SerIIBChb, a new molecular species was observed that was stable to both native gel electrophoresis and to gel filtration chromatography (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No other combination of proteins gave this result. Fig. 3 presents sedimentation velocity data using the following mixtures of proteins: IIAChb and IIBChb; phospho-IIAChb and IIBChb; IIAChband phospho-IIBChb; and IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb. These four combinations of proteins exhibited sedimentation coefficients predicted from the data obtained with the individual species, i.e. no higher order species were observed, indicating that none of the protein pairs formed a stable complex. (Because phosphoryl transfer does occur between two of the pairs of proteins, a transient complex, at least, must be formed, but its concentration was either too low to be detected or the transfer was complete prior to sedimentation.) By sharp contrast to these results, an equimolar mixture of phospho-IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb yielded a new species of much higher sedimentation coefficient than each of the individual proteins. A short column sedimentation equilibrium experiment revealed that the complex had about the expected molecular weight for a tetramer, which agreed with the analyses (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The composition of the complex is therefore: 1 mol of phospho-IIAChb dimer and 2 mol of Cys10SerIIBChb. The dissociation constant of the complex must be less than 10−7m (15Ralston G.B. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA1993: 5-6Google Scholar). Thus, we have been able to characterize a complex formed between phospho-IIAChb and the mutant, Cys10SerIIBChb. As far as we have been able to determine, there are no previous reports on transition state analogue intermediates in a phosphotransfer reaction between two proteins.A model depicting our conclusions of these and related CD spectral studies is schematically depicted in Fig.5. Phosphorylation of the IIAChb dimer results in a conformational change that permits binding of two mols of IIBChb to form one or more transient transition state complexes. Phosphate transfer to IIBChb and dissociation to the products completes the reaction, with concomitant change of IIAChb back to its original conformation. The phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system (PTS)1 consists of two soluble general proteins, Enzyme I and HPr, required for the uptake of all PTS sugars. These proteins are coupled to substrate-specific permeases or transporters that are ultimately responsible for the concomitant uptake and phosphorylation of carbohydrate substrates.

As far as we have been able to determine, there are no previous reports on transition state analogue intermediates in a phosphotransfer reaction between two proteins.A model depicting our conclusions of these and related CD spectral studies is schematically depicted in Fig.5. Phosphorylation of the IIAChb dimer results in a conformational change that permits binding of two mols of IIBChb to form one or more transient transition state complexes. Phosphate transfer to IIBChb and dissociation to the products completes the reaction, with concomitant change of IIAChb back to its original conformation. There are only a few studies on the hydrodynamic properties of the sugar-specific PTS proteins, and insofar as we know, none on the corresponding phosphoproteins (6Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 7Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, analytical sedimentation, both velocity and equilibrium, were used to characterize the following proteins of theN,N′-diacetylchitobiose transport system: IIAChb, phospho-IIAChb, IIBChb, phospho-IIBChb, a mutant Cys10SerIIBChb), and an apparent complex between phospho-IIAChb and the mutant protein. The latter is a likely candidate as a transition state analogue in the phosphotransfer reaction between IIAChb and IIBChb. IIAChb has considerable amino acid sequence similarity to IIALac, part of the lactose PTS permease in Gram-positive organisms; IIAChb is 33% identical to IIALacof Staphylococcus aureus and 35% identical to the same protein from Lactococcus lactis (7Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 543-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the latter protein reveals that it is 83% α-helix (16Sliz P. Engelmann R. Hengstenberg W. Pai E.F. Structure. 1997; 5: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas in the accompanying paper (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) we report that IIAChbis 75–85% helix. Nevertheless, IIAChb is very different from IIALac. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments (17Hays J.B. Simoni R.D. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 941-956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly established that IIALac forms a stable trimer, whereas the results reported here show that IIAChb forms a very stable dimer. Because no monomer was detected, the dissociation constant for the dimer would have to be less than 10−7m (15Ralston G.B. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA1993: 5-6Google Scholar). Further, there are other major differences between phospho-IIALac and phospho-IIAChb. IIALac is thought to dissociate when it is phosphorylated (18Deutscher J. Beyreuther K. Sobek H.M. Stüber K. Hengstenberg W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4867-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No monomeric phospho-IIAChb was detected in the sedimentation experiments reported here. Although they have the same molecular weight, the sedimentation coefficient of phospho-IIAChb was 10–15% less than that of IIAChb, suggesting that phosphorylation yielded a significantly less compact protein. These results agree with those obtained from the CD spectra, where it appeared that at 37 °C, phospho-IIAChb loses ∼35% of the helicity of IIAChb (2Keyhani N.O. Boudker O. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33091-33101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and was much more sensitive to thermal denaturation. The effects of protein concentration both on the stability to hydrolysis of the phosphoprotein and on its thermal denaturation suggested that the phosphodimer dissociates to phosphomonomer, but this effect was only apparent at 37 °C and above. The sedimentation experiments were conducted at temperatures ∼20 °C because significant hydrolysis of the phosphoprotein does occur over prolonged periods at the higher temperatures. The sedimentation velocity data indicate a change ins 20,w for IIAChb but not for phospho-IIAChb as a function of temperature (Table I). Because no change in extent of dimerization is observed, this result suggests an important change in shape and/or hydration with temperature. We are currently investigating this observation in greater detail. The solution and crystal structures of the mutant protein Cys10SerIIBChb have been described (19van Montford R.L.M. Pijning T. Kalk K.H. Reizer J. Saier M.H. Thunnissen M.M.G.M. Robillard G.T. Dijkstra B.W. Structure. 1997; 5: 217-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 20Ab E. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Saier M.H. Reizer J. Jacuinod M. Roepstorff P. Dijkstra K. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but there are no reports on the properties of IIBChb nor phospho-IIBChb. The sedimentation results presented here show that: (a) IIBChb, phospho-IIBChb, and Cys10SerIIBChb each behaves as a single monomeric species. (b) IIBChb and the mutant Cys10SerIIBChb exhibited identical sedimentation behavior, therefore suggesting that this mutation causes no significant change in structure (as reflected in the hydrodynamic properties). In contrast to IIAChb, where phosphorylation resulted in a lower sedimentation coefficient, phospho-IIBChb exhibited a significantly higher coefficient than IIBChb, implying that the phosphoprotein may be more compact than unphosphorylated IIBChb. (Similar effects can result from changes in hydration and/or shape.) As discussed elsewhere in these papers (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), phospho-IIBChb is a thiophosphoryl protein, analogous to protein-tyrosine phosphate phosphatases. In the latter, phosphorylation at the active site Cys causes a conformationally flexible loop in the peptide chain to close over the phosphoryl group, which conceivably would yield a more compact protein with a higher sedimentation coefficient. Finally, it should also be noted that IIBChbis a basic protein (pI about 8.0) and that the phosphoryl group may interact with basic groups in the protein, thereby resulting in a more compact structure than IIBChb. When phospho-IIAChb was mixed with an equimolar quantity of Cys10SerIIBChb, a new molecular species was observed that was stable to both native gel electrophoresis and to gel filtration chromatography (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). No other combination of proteins gave this result. Fig. 3 presents sedimentation velocity data using the following mixtures of proteins: IIAChb and IIBChb; phospho-IIAChb and IIBChb; IIAChband phospho-IIBChb; and IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb. These four combinations of proteins exhibited sedimentation coefficients predicted from the data obtained with the individual species, i.e. no higher order species were observed, indicating that none of the protein pairs formed a stable complex. (Because phosphoryl transfer does occur between two of the pairs of proteins, a transient complex, at least, must be formed, but its concentration was either too low to be detected or the transfer was complete prior to sedimentation.) By sharp contrast to these results, an equimolar mixture of phospho-IIAChb and Cys10SerIIBChb yielded a new species of much higher sedimentation coefficient than each of the individual proteins. A short column sedimentation equilibrium experiment revealed that the complex had about the expected molecular weight for a tetramer, which agreed with the analyses (3Keyhani N.O. Bacia K. Roseman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33102-33109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The composition of the complex is therefore: 1 mol of phospho-IIAChb dimer and 2 mol of Cys10SerIIBChb. The dissociation constant of the complex must be less than 10−7m (15Ralston G.B. Introduction to Analytical Ultracentrifugation. Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA1993: 5-6Google Scholar). Thus, we have been able to characterize a complex formed between phospho-IIAChb and the mutant, Cys10SerIIBChb. As far as we have been able to determine, there are no previous reports on transition state analogue intermediates in a phosphotransfer reaction between two proteins. A model depicting our conclusions of these and related CD spectral studies is schematically depicted in Fig.5. Phosphorylation of the IIAChb dimer results in a conformational change that permits binding of two mols of IIBChb to form one or more transient transition state complexes. Phosphate transfer to IIBChb and dissociation to the products completes the reaction, with concomitant change of IIAChb back to its original conformation."

The study of an enzyme capable of oxidizing nitroalkanes is of considerable interest from both fundamental and applied standpoints. Nitroalkanes are widely used as industrial solvents, chemical intermediates, explosives, and fuels (1Davis R.A. Clayton G.D. Clayton F.E. Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 599-662Google Scholar). Several nitroalkanes are toxic and/or carcinogenic (1Davis R.A. Clayton G.D. Clayton F.E. Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 599-662Google Scholar). Thus, an enzymatic activity that converts nitroalkanes into less harmful species has significant potential for bioremediation. From a chemical standpoint, the formation of nitronates in solution is a well characterized chemical reaction (2Bernasconi C.F. Adv. Phys. Org. Chem. 1992; 27: 119-238Google Scholar) that serves as the basis for understanding the formation of carbanions involving much weaker carbon acids, such as amino acids and α-hydroxy acids. Therefore, the study of an enzymatic activity that carries out the oxidation of nitroalkanes provides the unique opportunity to compare the enzyme-catalyzed formation of nitronates with the reaction in solution. Nitroalkane oxidase is isolated with the flavin cofactor in the form of an N(5)-[3-nitrobut-2-yl]-1,5-dihydroflavin adenine dinucleotide and is consequently not active (3Edmondson R.D. Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Russell D.H. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 2862-2865Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 4Gadda G. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5563-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This nitrobutyl-flavin adduct can be converted in vitro to FAD, yielding active enzyme (4Gadda G.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6154-6164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The FAD-containing enzyme is active on a broad range of primary and secondary nitroalkane substrates (6Kido T. Hashizume K. Soda K. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 133: 53-58Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 36: 309-313Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although other flavoprotein oxidases, such asd-amino acid oxidase (8Porter D.J.T. Voet J.G. Bright H.J. Z.

Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), have been shown to be able to oxidize nitroalkanes, nitroalkane oxidase is unique in that it requires the neutral form of the substrate for catalysis (4Gadda G.

Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mechanistic studies of nitroalkane oxidase support a chemical mechanism in which an active site base with a pK a value of 7 removes a proton from the α-carbon of the substrate to initiate catalysis (13Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1400-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,14Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The resulting carbanion attacks the N-5 position of FAD to form a covalent adduct that subsequently decays to form nitrite and the aldehyde or ketone product. This covalent adduct can be trapped by nitroethane anion during turnover of the enzyme with nitroethane, yielding 5-[3-nitrobut-2-yl]-1,5-dihydroflavin adenine dinucleotide (4Gadda G. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5563-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The steady state kinetic mechanism of nitroalkane oxidase has been determined with nitroethane (13Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1400-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The data are consistent with a ping-pong isomechanism in which the release of the aldehyde product from the reduced enzyme is followed by an irreversible isomerization to yield the enzyme species that reacts with oxygen. Despite the considerable advances in the biochemical and mechanistic characterization of the enzyme, no structural information is available beyond the sequence of part of the gene encoding for the N-terminal half of nitroalkane oxidase. 1G. Gadda and P. F. Fitzpatrick, unpublished results.In the absence of crystallographic data, an effective strategy to identify active site residues has been the use of irreversible inhibitors. This approach has been recently used to identify an essential tyrosine residue in the active site of nitroalkane oxidase (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the present report, we describe a kinetic and structural characterization of the inactivation of the FAD-containing form of nitroalkane oxidase by the cysteine-directed reagentN-ethylmaleimide (16Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 11: 541-548Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Nitroethane and FAD were from Sigma.N-Ethylmaleimide and valerate were from Aldrich.N-[ethyl-1-14C]Maleimide was from NENTM Life Scientific Products, Inc.l-1-Tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was purchased from Worthington. Nitroalkane oxidase was purified from F. oxysporum (ATCC 695) as described previously (7Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 36: 309-313Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The activated FAD-containing form of the enzyme was prepared according to Gadda et al. (4Gadda G. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5563-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and was stored at −70 °C in the presence of 0.5 mm FAD to prevent formation of the less stable apoprotein. The concentration of nitroalkane oxidase was determined by the method of Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. All other reagents were of the highest purity commercially available. Enzyme activities were measured with 20 mm nitroethane as substrate in air-saturated 0.5 mm FAD, 50 mm potassium phosphate, 16 mm imidazole, pH 7.5, by monitoring the rate of oxygen consumption with a computer-interfaced Hansatech Clark oxygen electrode at 30 °C, as described previously (7Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 36: 309-313Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stock solutions ofN-ethylmaleimide in 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, were prepared just prior to use. Nitroalkane oxidase (10–20 μm) was incubated with N-ethylmaleimide (3–15 mm) in 0.5 mm FAD, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 30 °C. All incubations were carried out in the presence of FAD to avoid the formation of apoprotein (5Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6154-6164Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). At different times, aliquots were withdrawn and assayed for enzymatic activity. For experiments in which the effect of valerate on the rate of inactivation was measured, the enzyme was incubated for 5 min with this compound before the addition ofN-ethylmaleimide. To stop the inactivation, unreactedN-ethylmaleimide was removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at room temperature. The irreversibility ofN-ethylmaleimide inactivation of nitroalkane oxidase was determined by incubating the modified enzyme isolated by gel filtration for 3 h in 0.5 mm FAD, 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 30 °C. At different times, aliquots were withdrawn and assayed for enzymatic activity. To identify the peptide whose modification byN-ethylmaleimide resulted in enzyme inactivation, 32 μm enzyme was incubated with 10 mm N-[ethyl-1-14C]maleimide (1.8 × 103 cpm/nmol) in the presence and absence of 25 mm valerate in a total volume of 0.5 ml. After 25 min, a second 10 mm aliquot of 10 mm N-[ethyl-1-14C]maleimide was added, and the incubation continued for an additional 25 min. The reaction was stopped by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 4 mm calcium chloride, 0.4 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8. After the addition of solid urea to a final concentration of 8 m, the samples were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The solutions were then diluted with three volumes of water followed by the addition of trypsin to a final concentration of 3% (w/w, trypsin/nitroalkane oxidase). After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, a second aliquot of trypsin (1% (w/w) final concentration) was added, and the digestion continued for a further 16 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding freshly prepared phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Purification of peptides was carried out by HPLC2 using a Waters instrument equipped with a model 996 photodiode array detector and a Vydac 218TP54 (4.6 × 250-mm) reverse-phase column at a flow rate of 1 ml min−1. Eluent A was 0.05% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and eluent B was 0.04% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. The chromatography was carried out with a linear gradient from 5 to 50% B over 90 min. Peptides were collected manually, and the amount of radioactivity incorporated in each was determined by scintillation counting. Automated Edman degradation of the purified peptide was carried out on a Hewlett-Packard G1000A protein sequencer at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory of Texas A & M University. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy of the purified peptide was carried out using a Voyager Elite XL mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) at the Laboratory for Biological Mass Spectrometry at Texas A & M University. MALDI-TOF spectra were acquired in the positive ion mode, using α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinamic acid as matrix. Samples were prepared for MALDI-TOF using the overlayer method of sample preparation previously described (18Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometry of the purified peptide was performed using an Esquire LC Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer equipped with a nanospray source (Bruker Daltonics, Inc., Billerica, MA). The time course of inactivation of nitroalkane oxidase by N-ethylmaleimide was analyzed by fitting the residual activity (A) at a given time (t) to Equation 1, A=Ae−kobstEquation 1 where A 0 is the initial activity andk obs is the observed rate of inactivation. Treatment of nitroalkane oxidase withN-ethylmaleimide at pH 7 and 30 °C results in a time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity, as shown in Fig.1. The inactivation is first-order for about 3 half-lives, but the rates decrease at longer times (data not shown). This could be due to hydrolysis of N-ethylmaleimide to form N-ethylmaleamate, a process previously reported to occur at pH 7 and above (16Riordan J.F. Vallee B.L. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 11: 541-548Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, the addition of a second aliquot of N-ethylmaleimide after three half-lives results in a further time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity. The initial rate of inactivation is dependent on the concentration of N-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 1). A plot of the rate of inactivation versus the concentration of the reagent is linear up to 15 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Fig. 1 B), indicating that there is no significant formation of a reversible complex between the reagent and the enzyme prior to inactivation. The second-order rate constant for inactivation determined from this plot is 3.4 ± 0.06m−1min−1. Valerate is a competitive inhibitor of nitroalkane oxidase with aK i value of 0.6 mm at pH 7 and 30 °C (14Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the presence of 25 mm valerate the rate of inactivation of nitroalkane oxidase by 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide decreases from 96 min−1 to 0.1 min−1(Fig. 1), consistent with the inactivation being active site-directed. To determine if the reaction between N-ethylmaleimide and nitroalkane oxidase is irreversible, the enzyme was separated from the remaining reagent by gel filtration when the residual activity had decreased to 6% of the initial value. The inactivated enzyme was then incubated in the absence of N-ethylmaleimide at pH 7 and 30 °C. No recovery of activity was observed after 3 h, consistent with the modification being irreversible. To identify the amino acid residue whose modification byN-ethylmaleimide resulted in the inactivation of the enzyme, nitroalkane oxidase was incubated withN-[ethyl-1-14C]maleimide in the presence and absence of valerate. The reactions were stopped when the residual activity of the enzyme incubated in the absence of valerate was 10%. At that time, the valerate-protected enzyme retains about 80% of the initial activity. Both samples were digested with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic digests were separated by reverse-phase HPLC. In our initial attempts the reaction was stopped by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid. When this was done, the tryptic maps of the two samples were identical (data not shown), suggesting that the modification is acid-labile. In contrast, when the reaction was quenched by using gel filtration to remove the unreacted reagent, the tryptic map of the sample lacking valerate showed an extra peak eluting at 61.4 min (Fig. 2). This was the only HPLC fraction showing significant incorporation of radioactivity in either sample. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the alkylated peptide was determined by automated Edman degradation to be LLNEVMXYPL (Table I), whereX indicates the absence of any phenylthiohydantoin derivative in the chromatogram. This sequence corresponds to that of a peptide in nitroalkane oxidase previously identified using tetranitromethane as an active site-directed reagent, LLNEVMXYPLFDGGNIGLR (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Table IN-terminal amino acid sequence of the peptide eluting at 61.4 min in the tryptic digest of nitroalkane oxidase treated with N-ethylmalcimideCycleAmino acidAmountpmol1Leu62Leu523Asn894Glu1045Val876Met867X 1-aResidue not identified.8Tyr819Pro4910Leu511-a Residue not identified. Open table in a new tab Mass spectrometry was used to definitively identify the residue at position 7 and the site of modification. Positive ion MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of the modified peptide yielded a predominant peak withm/z + value of 2248.8 (Fig.3). A cysteine residue at position 7 and incorporation of a single N-ethylmaleimide moiety into the peptide would yield a m/z + value of 2249, establishing cysteine as amino acid residue X. A second peak with m/z + value of 2264.7 was observed in the mass spectrum (Fig. 3), consistent with an oxidized form of the same peptide. The specific residue modified by N-ethylmaleimide was identified by nanospray mass spectrometry on an ion trap mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode. Species with mass/charge values of 1126 and 1132 were seen in the mass spectrum of the same peptide. The mass/charge value of the smaller species is consistent with that expected for the doubly charged ion of the alkylated peptide, while the higher mass/charge ratio species can be attributed to an oxidized form of the same peptide. These two parental ions were further fragmented while in the trap in order to obtain the sequence of the peptide, as illustrated in Fig. 4 for them/z 2+ species of 1132. The sequence of the alkylated peptide could be determined by comparing them/z + values of the daughter ions to the calculated values expected for the peptides produced in the fragmentation process (Table II). The sequences of both peptides determined from the ion trap spectrometric analysis were in agreement with that from the Edman analysis. The data in Table II are consistent with the cysteine residue at position 7 being the site of alkylation by N-ethylmaleimide and the methionine residue at position 6 being oxidized in the species withm/z 2+ value of 1132. Since no methionine sulfoxide was seen in the automated sequence analysis of the same peptide, the oxidized methionine probably formed during the mass spectrometric analysis.Table IIIon trap mass spectrometric analysis of the N-ethylmaleimide-containing peptideParental ionExperimental ionTheoretical ionPeptide fragmentm/z 2+m/z +m/z +1126686.5686.4GGNIGLR801.6801.4DGGNIGLR948.5948.5FDGGNIGLR1061.71061.6LFDGGNIGLR1158.61158.6PLFDGGNIGLR1321.51321.8YPLFDGGNIGLR1550.51549.9(C-NEM 2-aNEM,N-ethylmaleimide. )YPLFDGGNIGLR1678.81681.1M(C-NEM)YPLFDGGNIGLR1132345.2345.2GLR458.4458.3IGLR569.5572.4NIGLR630.5629.4GNIGLR686.5686.4GGNIGLR801.6801.4DGGNIGLR948.5948.5FDGGNIGLR1062.61061.6LFDGGNIGLR1158.61158.6PLFDGGNIGLR1321.61321.8YPLFDGGNIGLR1549.61549.9(C-NEM)YPLFDGGNIGLR1696.71697.1(M-O 2-bM-O, oxidized methionine residue. )(C-NEM)YPLFDGGNIGLR1795.91796.2V(M-O)(C-NEM)YPLFDGGNIGLR1923.31925.3EV(M-O)(C-NEM)YPLFDGGNIGLR2-a NEM,N-ethylmaleimide.2-b M-O, oxidized methionine residue. Open table in a new tab Mechanistic studies of nitroalkane oxidase are consistent with a mechanism for catalysis in which a base on the enzyme removes a proton from the α-carbon of the substrate to form a carbanion (Scheme FS2) (4Gadda G. Edmondson R.D. Russell D.H. Fitzpatrick P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5563-5570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 13Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F.

During the normal course of catalysis, the carbanion can attack the N-5 position of the cofactor to form a covalent adduct. This adduct can lose nitrite to form a highly reactive cationic imine that can then react with hydroxide to form the aldehyde or ketone product and reduced flavin. Alternatively, the cationic imine can react with nitroethane anion in solution to form the stable and inactive 5-nitrobutyl-flavin. Despite the advances in the mechanistic and biochemical characterization of the enzyme, no structural information is available beyond the sequence of part of the gene encoding for nitroalkane oxidase1. The use of irreversible chemical modification reagents has long been employed to study the active site of enzymes whose structures are not available. By using this approach, we have recently identified a tyrosine residue in the active site of nitroalkane oxidase (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The results presented here identify a cysteine residue as also being in the active site of the enzyme. Nitroalkane oxidase is irreversibly inactivated in a time- and concentration-dependent fashion by treatment withN-ethylmaleimide. The inactivation is active site-directed, based on the protection from inactivation afforded by the competitive inhibitor valerate. The tryptic digests of nitroalkane oxidase treated with N-[ethyl-1-14C]maleimide both in the presence and absence of valerate show that a single peptide is differentially labeled by N-ethylmaleimide in the inactivated enzyme. This peptide is the same as the one previously identified using tetranitromethane as an active site probe (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue identified here is adjacent to the active site tyrosine nitrated by tetranitromethane (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), strengthening the conclusion that both of these residues are in the active site of the enzyme. As previously reported, no direct match of the sequence of the alkylated peptide could be found with the available partial gene sequence of nitroalkane oxidase,1 indicating that the cysteine and tyrosine residues are located in the C-terminal half of the protein. In terms of the catalytic roles of these two residues, we have previously proposed that the tyrosine residue participates in substrate binding by forming a hydrogen bond to the nitro group of the nitroalkane substrate (15Gadda G. Banerjee A. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A possible role for a cysteine residue is as the active site base that abstracts a proton from the α-carbon of the substrate, as is the case with the flavoprotein dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (19Bjornberg O. Rowland P. Larsen S. Jensen K.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16197-16205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 20Rowland P. Bjornberg O. Nielsen F.S. Jensen K.F. Larsen S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1269-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The involvement of a cysteine residue in catalysis is consistent with solvent kinetic isotope effect studies of nitroalkane oxidase, specifically an inverse effect on theV/K value of about 0.5.1 Previous pH dependence studies on the enzyme showed the presence of a base with a pK a value of 7 in the free enzyme (14Gadda G. Fitzpatrick P.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1406-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the effects of D2O on the pH dependence do not support the assignment of the cysteine as the residue responsible for this pK a. The pK a value of a cysteine residue should shift less than 0.4 units when changing from water to D2O (21Quinn D.M. Sutton L.D. Cook P.F. Enzyme Mechanisms from Isotope Effects. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 73-126Google Scholar). Instead, the pK a value increases to 7.7 in D2O,1 strongly suggesting that the catalytic base in nitroalkane oxidase is not a cysteine residue. In the catalytic mechanism of Scheme FS2, another active site base is required to deprotonate a water molecule to form the hydroxide that reacts with the cationic imine formed during catalysis. Although a serine residue would seem more appropriate for this reaction due to the pK a value of about 15 of its functional group (22Jencks W.P. Regenstein J. Fasman G.D. 3rd Ed. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. I. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1976: 305-351Google Scholar), a cysteine residue with an unusually high pK a value could act as this base. An alternative explanation is that the active site cysteine is not directly involved in catalysis but that enzyme inactivation stems from steric hindrance due to the presence of theN-ethylmaleimide moiety in the active site preventing substrate binding. In summary, the chemical modification studies withN-ethylmaleimide presented here show that a cysteine residue is present in the active site of the flavoprotein nitroalkane oxidase. This amino acid residue is located next to a tyrosine residue previously identified in the active site of nitroalkane oxidase. These results are a prerequisite to future mutagenesis studies aimed at a better understanding of the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme. We thank Dr. William K.

They accomplish this, in part, by expressing a diverse set of transmembrane receptors on their surfaces that are capable of recognizing and responding to a large number of distinct ligands. Stimulation of a specific receptor typically leads to the activation of several signal transduction pathways; activation of these distinct pathways effects changes in gene transcription, thereby shaping the response to a particular stimulus. One such pathway, the ubiquitous Ras signal transduction pathway, regulates proliferative responses emanating from a variety of receptors (reviewed in Ref. 1Dickson B. Hafen E. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Ras itself was initially identified based on its potent ability to induce neoplastic transformation of a variety of cell types (2Chang E.H. Furth M.E. Scolnick E.M. Lowy D.R. Nature. 1982; 297: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 3Dhar R. Ellis R.W. Shih T.Y. Oroszlan S. Shapiro B. Maizel J. Lowy D. Scolnick E.

Nature. 1982; 300: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). This oncogenic potential is underscored by the finding that over 25% of all human tumors bear activated alleles of ras (reviewed in Ref.5Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, the Ras signaling pathway has been shown to play an important role in regulating many developmental processes,e.g. vulval development in Caenorhabditis elegans, ommatidial development in Drosophila, and lymphocyte development in mice (reviewed in Refs. 6Wassarman D.A. Therrien M. Rubin G.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 44-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Eisenmann D.M. Kim S.K. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Acta. 1998; 1377: F35-F78PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Ras transduces signals will provide important insights into both the process of tumorigenesis and the regulation of cellular differentiation.Ras activates a number of distinct effector molecules including the serine/threonine kinase Raf, the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-OH-kinase, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ral, Ral GDP dissociation stimulator, and the Ras GTPase-activating protein (10Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). A key question concerns the role that these specific effectors play in directly modulating the expression of genes entrained by Ras. To evaluate the effects of stimulating a specific pathway, a method capable of activating discrete downstream effector molecules is required. We sought to engineer such an approach through coumermycin-mediated intracellular multimerization of target proteins, focusing in particular on Raf.Raf is normally activated through recruitment to the plasma membrane mediated by an interaction with GTP-bound Ras (11Zhang X.-f. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar, 12Warne P.H.

This membrane localization leads to Raf activation via a process that is not yet well understood. To study Raf-specific signal transduction events, we developed an inducible dimerization strategy that allows for the conditional activation of Raf (16Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our approach uses the symmetrically dimeric antibiotic coumermycin to promote either membrane translocation or dimerization of Raf fusion proteins that bear the coumermycin-binding domain GyrB. During the course of these initial studies, we found that Raf kinase activity can be induced by Raf dimerization, or more likely oligomerization, even in the absence of membrane localization. This activation of Raf by oligomerization is not unique to coumermycin-based strategies, as a similar result was obtained using FK1012-induced dimerization of Raf-FKBP chimeras (17Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We have now examined more distal effects of Raf activation following coumermycin-induced oligomerization, and here report that, although coumermycin-induced clustering of cytoplasmic forms of Raf-GyrB does lead to robust activation of Mek, it does not activate downstream signaling effectors such as Erk1 or Erk2, nor does it modulate Raf-regulated gene transcription. In contrast, coumermycin-mediated oligomerization of membrane-localized forms of Raf-GyrB, which are not by themselves constitutively active, leads to dramatic increases in downstream MAP1kinase activation, Fos protein levels, and Raf-dependent gene transcription. These results show that membrane localization is not necessarily required for Raf activation, but is crucial for targeting Raf signals to distal effectors. In addition, our results demonstrate that coumermycin-induced activation of membrane-localized Raf-GyrB can be a useful tool for identifying both protein effectors and gene targets regulated by Raf.RESULTSWe have previously demonstrated that coumermycin-mediated oligomerization of Raf-GyrB fusion proteins leads to robust activation of the direct target of Raf, the dual-specificity kinase Mek (16Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To explore more fully this stimulation of the Raf signaling cascade induced via oligomerization, we examined the activation of more distal effectors. We focused initially on the MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2; these MAP kinases are activated by Mek via phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues (23Ahn N.G. Seger R. Bratlien R.L. Diltz C.D. Tonks N.K. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4220-4227Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Payne D.M. Rossomando A.J. Martino P. Erickson A.K. Her J.H. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 885-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar, 25Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). To examine whether coumermycin-induced oligomerization of Raf-GyrB could activate Erk1 and Erk2, Raf-GyrB expressing NIH3T3 stable transfectants were stimulated with either coumermycin or EGF. The presence of activated MAP kinase was detected using antibodies that recognize the threonine- and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms of Erk1 and Erk2. As shown in Fig.1 A, EGF treatment led to a dramatic increase in phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 within 5 min of stimulation (17.8-fold induction of phospho-Erk2). In contrast, coumermycin stimulation led to a very modest (2.7-fold induction of Erk2) and transient increase in Erk phosphorylation. Similarly, PMA treatment, which is known to potently activate the MAP kinase pathway, gave a greater than 20-fold increase in Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation while coumermycin addition stimulated only weak MAP kinase activation (Fig. 1 C). This result was not due to ineffective Mek activation as coumermycin stimulation of Raf-GyrB transfectants led to Mek phosphorylation (and hence activation) at comparable levels to those observed for PMA stimulation of either these same cells (Fig.1 B and Ref. 16Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) or non-transfected NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that, despite robust activation of Mek (Ref. 16Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 B), coumermycin-induced Raf-GyrB oligomerization does not lead to significant activation of the downstream targets Erk1 and Erk2.Activation of Raf normally occurs following its recruitment to the plasma membrane, and this localization may be important for coupling Raf/Mek activation to efficient Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we generated a series of Raf-GyrB chimeric proteins that localized either to membrane or cytosolic compartments (Fig.2, A and B). The membrane-localized form of Raf-GyrB was created by adding an amino-terminal myristylation and palmitylation sequence derived from the Src family kinase Lck (referred to as Lck-Raf-GyrB). Previous work has established that this sequence is sufficient for targeting heterologous proteins to the membrane compartment, and that both myristylation and palmitylation are required for this effect (26Shenoy-Scaria A.M. Gauen L.K. Kwong J. Shaw A.S. Lublin D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6385-6392Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We also generated three control constructs in which either a Myc tag or mutated myristylation/palmitylation sequences were added to the amino terminus of Raf-GyrB. In the first mutant (C3S,C5S), the cysteine residues required for palmitylation were changed to serines. In the second mutant (G2A), the glycine residue at position 2 was changed to alanine. The latter mutation prevents both myristylation and palmitylation, since prior myristylation is required for palmitylation (27Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Using these constructs, we generated a panel of stable NIH3T3 transfectants. The Lck-Raf-GyrB constructs were expressed at levels equivalent to endogenous Raf, and the other three constructs were expressed at 2–3-fold higher levels, as judged by immunoblotting (data not shown). Subcellular fractionation studies demonstrated that the Lck-Raf-GyrB construct was predominately localized to the membrane fraction, while the other three constructs co-localized with endogenous Raf and were found predominately in the cytoplasm (Fig.2 B).Figure 2Membrane localization of Raf-GyrB is required for coumermycin-dependent activation of Erk1 and Erk2. A, unique amino-terminal extensions were added to Raf-GyrB consisting of a Myc tag, an 8-amino acid Lck-derived myristylation/palmitylation sequence, or two distinct mutants of the Lck myristylation/palmitylation sequence. These constructs were transfected into NIH3T3 cells, and stably expressing cell lines were generated. B, subcellular localization of Raf-GyrB constructs. Subcellular fractionation was carried out by differential centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio of Raf-GyrB to Raf was determined in membrane (M)versus cytosolic (C) fractions. -Fold enrichment of Raf-GyrB constructs in the membrane fraction was determined relative to endogenous Raf and was calculated as the ratio of Raf-GyrB to Raf in the membrane fraction divided by the ratio of Raf-GyrB to Raf in the cytoplasmic fraction. Results for Lck-Raf-GyrB, Raf-GyrB, and Myc-Raf-GyrB are representative of four or more experiments, while the results for the G2A and C3S,C5S constructs are representative examples of two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These cell lines were then tested for the ability of coumermycin to induce Mek and Erk phosphorylation. As seen in Fig.3 (panels A–D), coumermycin stimulation leads to an increase in Mek phosphorylation in all cell lines tested. The level of Mek activation seen in Myc-Raf-GyrB, C3S,C5S, and Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants was comparable to that observed when stimulating these cell lines with PMA. The G2A transfectant responded to coumermycin to a lesser but still significant extent. In contrast, neither the Myc-Raf-GyrB construct nor the G2A or C3S,C5S constructs exhibited notable, sustained increases in Erk activation following coumermycin stimulation (Fig. 3, panels E–G). However, stimulation of Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants with coumermycin resulted in a rapid and dramatic increase in the level of phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 3, panel H). Appreciable activation could be seen within 1 min of stimulation, with maximal phosphorylation occurring after 5 min. Membrane localization mediated by the Lck myristylation/palmitylation sequence did not lead to constitutive activation of the Raf pathway (see Fig. 3, panels D and H, Me2SO (DMSO) treatment). Moreover, none of the cell lines tested responded to novobiocin (a monomeric form of coumermycin), indicating that the response was truly dependent on coumermycin-induced oligomerization of Lck-Raf-GyrB, and not just due to nonspecific effects of drug binding to the GyrB domain (data not shown). All cell lines tested, irrespective of the construct with which they were transfected, remained responsive to PMA. Hence, the lack of response to coumermycin did not reflect a generalized defect in the Ras pathway in these transfectants (Fig. 3).Figure 3Coumermycin-induced activation of membrane-localized Raf-GyrB leads to increases in Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation. NIH3T3 cells were stably transfected with the Myc-Raf-GyrB, G2A, C3S,C5S, or Lck-Raf-GyrB constructs. Cells were serum-starved for 20 h and then stimulated with either coumermycin (Cou., 900 nm) or PMA (10 ng/ml). Phospho-Mek (panels A–D) and phospho-Erk1 and -Erk2 levels (panels E–H) were determined as in Fig. 1. They axis represents -fold induction relative to cells stimulated with vehicle (DMSO). Experiments for G2A and C3S,C5S constructs are representative examples of two or more experiments, while experiments for Myc-Raf-GyrB and Lck-Raf-GyrB are representative examples of five or more experiments; error bars represent the range of duplicate measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Typically, activation of Erk1 and Erk2 results in the phosphorylation of additional effector proteins including transcription factors such as the Ets family member Elk-1. Phosphorylated Elk-1, in turn, can bind to the promoters of a number of genes including those for c-fos. This leads to an increase in fos mRNA transcription and ultimately an increase in Fos protein abundance (28Marais R. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1993; 73: 381-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar,29Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether coumermycin stimulation of Raf-GyrB or Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants could lead to up-regulation of Fos protein levels. As shown in Fig. 4, coumermycin stimulation of Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants resulted in a significant increase in Fos protein accumulation (3.6-fold induction). This result compares well with that obtained when stimulating cells with PMA. In contrast, Raf-GyrB transfectants showed no significant increase in Fos protein levels following coumermycin stimulation, although they still remained responsive to PMA (Fig. 4).Figure 4Coumermycin-induced activation of membrane-localized Raf-GyrB increases nuclear Fos protein levels.Raf-GyrB or Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants were treated with novobiocin (Novo., 900 nm), coumermycin (Cou., 900 nm), or PMA (10 ng/ml) for 75 min. Cell nuclei were harvested and nuclear extracts prepared. Extracts were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes. Fos protein was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Fos antibodies. The y axis represents -fold induction relative to cells stimulated with novobiocin. Shown is a representative example of three experiments;error bars represent the range of duplicate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine this issue more broadly, we compared wholesale changes in mRNA abundance using gene macroarrays. Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants were stimulated with novobiocin (as a negative control), coumermycin, or PMA (as a positive control). Transcript abundance in cells treated with novobiocin was equivalent to that seen in cells treated with carrier alone (Me2SO). In contrast, stimulation of Lck-Raf-GyrB cells with either coumermycin or PMA led to very similar changes in the pattern of gene expression. Specifically, stimulating Lck-Raf-GyrB transfectants with coumermycin for 40 min led to a greater than 2.5-fold change in mRNA levels for 71 out of 588 genes examined. These included a number of genes known to be induced downstream of the Raf pathway, most notably egr-1 (20-fold induction), c-fos (4.4-fold induction), and c-myc(5.5-fold induction) (29Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 30Qureshi S.A. Rim M. Bruder J. Kolch W. Rapp U. Sukhatme V.P. Foster D.A. J. Biol.

In contrast, no changes in gene expression were observed when stimulating Raf-GyrB-transfected cells with coumermycin (Fig. 5 A and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that both oligomerization and appropriate membrane localization of Raf are critical for connecting Raf activation to changes in downstream gene transcription.Figure 5Coumermycin stimulation leads to changes in mRNA levels for multiple genes. Lck-Raf-GyrB- or Raf-GyrB-transfected cells were stimulated for 40 min with novobiocin (Novo., 900 nm), coumermycin (Cou., 900 nm), or PMA (10 ng/ml). RNA was harvested and used to generate radiolabeled probes. The probes were hybridized to parallel Atlas mouse gene array blots to determine relative abundance of mRNA following stimulation with the above agents. Results shown for Lck-Raf-GyrB are the average of two separate experiments, while those for Raf-GyrB represent one experiment.

Open table in a new tab DISCUSSIONThe Ras signal transduction pathway plays a key role in regulating both cell proliferation and differentiation. A large number of specific effectors of Ras have been identified that propagate Ras signals (reviewed in Ref. 10Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). However, the exact role that these different effectors play in regulating downstream protein function remains to be elucidated. In particular, it has been very difficult to uniquely and inducibly activate any one Ras effector and thereby investigate effects specific to that branch of the Ras signaling cascade. We have pursued the development of a system that allows one to study the activation of one such effector, the serine/threonine kinase Raf, in a specific and conditional manner.Raf activation is initiated by translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (32Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 33Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). Once at the plasma membrane, Raf becomes fully activated by a process that is still not completely understood. However, a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that oligomerization of Raf plays a role in this process. For example, it has recently been shown that Ras exists as a dimer and that driving Ras dimerization also activates the Raf pathway (34Inouye K. Mizutani S. Koide H. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3737-3740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in yeast the scaffolding protein Ste5 has been shown to organize signaling of the yeast homologs of Raf (Ste11), Mek (Ste7), and MAP kinase (Fus3) (35Choi K.Y. Satterberg B. Lyons D.M. Elion E.A. Cell. 1994; 78: 499-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 36Marcus S. Polverino A. Barr M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7762-7766Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 37Printen J.A. Sprague Jr., G.F. Genetics. 1994; 138: 609-619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dimerization of Ste5 is both necessary and sufficient to activate Ste11 and its downstream targets Ste7 and Fus3 (38Yablonski D. Marbach I. Levitzki A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13864-13869Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 39Inouye C. Dhillon N. Thorner J. Science. 1997; 278: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our initial results suggested that oligomerization of Raf not only leads to its activation but may, in fact, obviate the membrane localization step that typically occurs during this process (16Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). To investigate this in greater detail, we examined more distal events such as the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 and the accumulation of Fos protein levels. Following coumermycin-induced oligomerization of cytoplasmic Raf, we found that Erk1 and Erk2 were only minimally activated and that no accumulation of Fos protein could be detected. Furthermore, using gene macroarrays that included a number of genes thought to be regulated by the Raf pathway (i.e. fos, myc, and egr-1), we saw no changes in gene transcription. Thus, although cytoplasmic clustering of Raf was sufficient to activate Mek, this did not lead to efficient coupling of activated Mek to more distal effectors.One possible explanation for this result, especially in light of what is known about Ste5 functioning in yeast, is that membrane localization of Raf is required to target Raf/Mek signals to appropriate substrates. To test this possibility, we generated Raf-GyrB fusion proteins that contained an amino-terminal myristylation and palmitylation signal sequence derived from the Src family kinase Lck. This resulted in a membrane-localized form of Raf-GyrB (Lck-Raf-GyrB). Previous studies have demonstrated that transiently expressing farnesylated versions of Raf (Raf-CAAX) in Cos cells results in membrane localization of Raf and constitutive activation of the Raf pathway (32Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar, 33Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (836) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that membrane localization of Raf, achieved by amino-terminal acylation, does not lead to constitutive activation of Raf in stably transfected NIH3T3 cells. It is unclear why membrane targeting of Raf via farnesylation should result in constitutive activation of Raf, while targeting via myristylation/palmitylation does not. This discrepancy may reflect differences in the expression level achieved in our stable NIH3T3 transfectants, in which Lck-Raf-GyrB is expressed at the same level as endogenous Raf, versustransient Cos cell transfectants, in which Raf-CAAX is most likely expressed at supraphysiological concentrations. Overexpression of Raf-CAAX could lead to fortuitous association, mimicking oligomerization, and hence activation, such as has been seen following the overexpression of other kinases (40Ichijo H. Nishida E. Irie K. ten Dijke P. Saitoh M. Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1999) Google Scholar) or of caspases (41Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis, Mineo et al. (42Mineo C. Anderson R.G. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have found that stable expression of Raf-CAAX in NIH3T3 cells also does not lead to constitutive activation of the Raf pathway. In addition, it is possible that farnesylation of Raf directly promotes interactions with effector substrates. For example, farnesylation of Ras2 (in yeast) leads to a 100-fold increase in its affinity for adenylyl cyclase (43Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This result reflected a change in binding affinity, and was not merely an effect of enhanced proximity due to membrane association, as a similar change was observed using solubilized Ras2 and adenylyl cyclase. Regardless of the actual mechanism, our results suggest that the effect achieved by transient expression of Raf-CAAX in Cos cells most likely involves more than simply targeting Raf to the plasma membrane.The ability to target Raf to the membrane fraction, without concomitantly activating it, allowed us to examine the effects of oligomerization of Raf in this compartment. In striking contrast to what we observed with cytoplasmic forms of Raf, coumermycin-induced oligomerization of membrane-localized Raf led to dramatic increases in Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation, a significant increase in Fos protein accumulation, and the up-regulation of mRNAs for many genes. These changes paralleled those seen when cells were stimulated with PMA. Such overlap in response is not surpri"

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). This unusual sugar is the first component of the oligosaccharide core region that links lipid A to the O-antigen (2Rietschel E.T. Brade L. Schade U. Seydel U. Zarhinger U. Kusumoto S. Brade H. Schrinner E. Richmond M.H. Seibert G. Schwarz U. Surface Structures of Microorganisms and Their Interactions with the Mammalian Host. VCH Verlagsgesellschaft mbh, Weinheim, Germany1987: 1-41Google Scholar) (Fig.1). KDO is incorporated into the LPS in four steps from d-arabinose 5-phosphate (A5P) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). The first step is the condensation of A5P and PEP to form KDO 8-phosphate (KDO8P), catalyzed by KDO8P synthase (3Levin D.H. Racker E. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 2532-2539Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting phosphorylated monosaccharide is first converted to free KDO and then activated with cytosine triphosphate to form CMP-KDO (4Ghalambor M.A. Heath E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3216-3221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single CMP-KDO is used to attach KDO to lipid A and form the backbone of the oligosaccharide inner core (5Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A second and often a third KDO are branched off of the linking sugar. The remainder of the inner and outer core is sequentially assembled from activated monosaccharides before the O-antigen is added as an intact unit.Figure 5Interaction between subunits A (left) and C (right) of E. coli KDO8P synthase.

Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These researchers isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant strain of Salmonella typhimurium that is dependent upon exogenous A5P for growth at the non-permissive temperature. In the absence of A5P this mutant accumulates incomplete LPS, eventually leading to inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis (7Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4895-4903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of crude cellular extracts indicated that KDO8P synthase from the mutated strain suffers from an elevated K m for A5P. Further characterization of these and other mutant strains of S. typhimurium has demonstrated that disruption of LPS formation through defects in KDO incorporation leads to bacteria whose normal growth and function have been compromised (8Hansen-Hagge T. Lehmann V. Luderitz O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 148: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Rick P.D. Young D.A. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 150: 447-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding, coupled with the localization of KDO to only Gram-negative organisms and plants (10Doong R.L. Ahmad S. Jensen R.A. Plant Cell Environ. 1991; 14: 113-120Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggests that KDO8P synthase is a valuable chemotherapeutic target for the development of novel antibacterial agents. KDO8P synthase from E. coli has been well characterized over the past several years, and although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, several key aspects of the enzymatic reaction are known. KDO8P synthase catalyzes the addition of the siface of PEP onto the re face of A5P, with the concomitant production of inorganic phosphate (11Dotson G.D. Nanjappan P. Reily M.D. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12392-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 12Kohen A. Berkovich R. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 3: 1577-1582Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This reaction is unusual in that phosphate is released via C–O bond cleavage, rather than via the more common P–O bond cleavage (13Hedstrom L. Abeles R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). KDO8P synthase is specific for A5P as the phosphorylated monosaccharide substrate and displays no requirement for a metal cofactor. Two mechanisms have been proposed for the condensation reaction as follows: (a) direct attack by water at C-2PEP to form a linear intermediate and (b) internal attack by a hydroxyl to form a cyclic intermediate (Fig. 2). Results from inhibition studies with both cyclic and acyclic product analogues (15Baasov T. Sheffer-Dee-Noor S. Kohen A. Jakob A. Belakhov V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 991-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,16D'Souza F.W. Benenson Y. Baasov T. Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 2457-2462Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have failed to differentiate between these mechanisms, and although no direct evidence exists, a recent structure determination favors the linear intermediate (17Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In contrast to the numerous phenotypic studies on temperature-sensitiveS. typhimurium mutants, and despite the prominent role of these experiments in rationalizing the study of KDO8P synthase and the wealth of knowledge concerning Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase, the nature of the S. typhimurium KDO8P synthase mutation at the enzymatic level has never been investigated. S. typhimurium AG701i50 is unable to grow at 42 °C and has been used in complementation experiments to identify KDO8P synthase activity encoded in DNA libraries (18Brabetz W. Brade H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 19Walsh A.G. Burrows L.L. Lam J.S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 27-33PubMed Google Scholar, 20Woisetschlager M. Hogenauer G. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 437-439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that strain AG701i50 encodes for an altered KDO8P synthase, but this has never been proven experimentally. The parent strain of AG701i50 (S. typhimurium AG701) is also available, and although the lineage of these strains in relation to the mutants originally described by Rick and Osborn (6Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) is unclear, they offer the unique opportunity to compare KDO8P synthase from parent/daughter strains of S. typhimurium and to determine, for the first time, the molecular basis for impaired enzymatic activity. To achieve this end we cloned the kdsA gene from both S. typhimurium AG701 and AG701i50 and overexpressed and characterized the respective KDO8P synthases. Phosphoenolpyruvate mono(cyclohexyl ammonium) salt, thiobarbituric acid, and Tris base were from Sigma.d-Arabinose 5-phosphate was prepared as described by Volk (21Volk W.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 37: 365-367Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and purified by anion exchange chromatography to yield the monolithium salt. Cell culture media reagents were from Difco. All media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin unless otherwise indicated. All other chemicals were from Fisher. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Centriprep-10 centrifugal concentrators were from Millipore. Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing was performed by the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities.S. typhimurium AG701 and AG701i50 were a generous gift from Dr. Werner Brabetz, Forschungszentrum Borstel, Borstel, Germany. XL1-Blue (Stratagene) and BL21(DE3) (Novagen) E. colistrains were purchased as chemically competent preparations. The following procedure was used with both S. typhimurium AG701 and S. typhimuriumAG701i50. Standard polymerase chain reaction methodologies were used to amplify the putative kdsA gene from S. typhimurium genomic DNA. The forward primer was 5′-GATTCTAGAATTCATATG AAACAAAAAGTGGTTAACATTGGCG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-GATTCTGAATTCGGATCCAAGCTCAGTTCTCGGTATCCAGCTCGTCG-3′ (gene sequences underlined). The amplification product was isolated, restricted with NdeI and BamHI (italics), and ligated into similarly treated pT7-7 (22Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar). The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli XL1-Blue cells. Plasmid DNA was isolated from several positive transformants and screened by restriction mapping. Those plasmids with the expected restriction pattern were subjected to DNA sequencing to confirm the presence of the desired gene. The plasmid arising from AG701 genomic DNA was designated pT7-7-kdsA-701, whereas that from AG701i50 was designated pT7-7-kdsA-701i50. These plasmids were then used to transform E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. Finally, the presence of the desired plasmid was verified by additional restriction mapping. Electroporation was achieved in a Bio-RadE. coli Pulser. S. typhimurium AG701i50 cells were prepared and transformed with the desired plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the desired plasmid in selected transformants was verified by restriction mapping. The following procedures were performed in media without antibiotic supplementation. A growing culture of S. typhimurium in LB medium (A 600 = 0.2) was diluted 25-fold into 2× YT medium pre-equilibrated at the desired growth temperature. This culture was grown with vigorous shaking and theA 600 monitored as a function of time. In experiments with exogenous A5P, the growth medium was supplemented with the appropriate concentration of monosaccharide immediately prior to inoculation. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing the appropriate plasmid (described above) were grown in 2× YT at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. When this culture reached an A 600 of 0.6–0.8, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 4 h following induction. The following steps were performed at 4 °C. Pelleted cells were suspended (1 g per 5 ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.6 (Buffer A), and sonicated for 90 s (30-s pulses with a 90-s rest between pulses). The crude extract was centrifuged to remove cellular debris, and the supernatant was saved. The resultant pellet was suspended, sonicated, and centrifuged as above. The supernatants were combined and loaded onto a 5-ml Econo-Pac High Q cartridge (Bio-Rad) at 1.0 ml/min. The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer A, and then a linear gradient of 0–500 mm KCl in Buffer A was applied over 60 ml. Fractions were assayed for KDO8P synthase activity using the periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay (23Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Active fractions were pooled and then concentrated and buffer-exchanged into 25 mmsodium succinate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 6.5, by ultrafiltration. The enzyme was then aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. KDO8P synthase obtained in this manner is ∼95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Purified wild-type KDO8P synthase (115 μg, 3.8 nmol) was mixed with 11 mm A5P (22 μmol), 13 mm PEP (26 μmol), and 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 2.0 ml. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and then quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid (500 μl). Purification of the resultant phosphorylated monosaccharide was as previously reported (23Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The 1H NMR spectrum of the product was recorded on a Bruker Avance DRX 500 at 500 MHz using the Watergate gradient suppression program and found to be identical to that previously reported for KDO8P (23Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). PEP, A5P, and Tris acetate, pH 7.4 (45 μl), were incubated at the indicated temperature (15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 or 45 °C) for 3 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 5-μl aliquot of 1 μm KDO8P synthase prepared in 25 mm sodium succinate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 6.5 (held at 4 °C), to give final concentrations of 1 or 5 mm PEP, 1 or 5 mm A5P, 100 mm Tris acetate, and 5 nm enzyme. The reaction was quenched after a 1–15-min incubation by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid (50 μl). A 90-μl aliquot of the quenched reaction mixture was subjected to the periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay, and the amount of product released was determined using ε = 103 000 m−1cm−1 at 549 nm (23Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction time was varied to maintain the extent of reaction at <10%. A 1 μmsolution of wild-type or P145S enzyme was prepared in 25 mmsodium succinate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, pH 6.5, at 4 °C and assayed as above (5 mm PEP, 5 mmA5P, 37 °C). The enzyme solution was moved to 37 °C, and 5-μl aliquots were removed and assayed every 15 min for 1 h. The enzyme solution was then returned to 4 °C and incubated for 1 h and finally assayed again as above. Spectra were recorded either with a Hewlett-Packard 8453 or with a Cary 3 Bio UV-Visible Spectrophotometer, each with a jacketed cuvette holder. Extent of reaction was determined by following the disappearance of the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety of PEP at 232 nm (ε = 2840m−1cm−1). K m andV max values were determined from a nonlinear regression of the reaction progress curve (24Duggleby R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 61-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) using KaleidaGraph 3.08d (Synergy Software). k cat was determined fromk cat =V max/[E]0. All reactions were performed in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, at either 25 or 37 °C. In a typical reaction, buffer, enzyme (0.6–1.2 μg of wild-type KDO8P synthase) and PEP were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 20-μl aliquot of A5P for a final volume of 1.0 ml. The reaction was vortexed and transferred to a temperature-equilibrated cuvette, and data were recorded for 3–5 min in 5–15-s intervals. For an experiment measuring the kinetic parameters for A5P, the initial concentration of PEP was 20× K m, the initial concentration of A5P was 3×K m, and the reaction was followed to 95% completion. The extent of reaction of PEP was <5%. The relative concentrations of PEP and A5P were reversed to measure the parameters for PEP. No product inhibition was observed over the course of the reaction. K m andV max values were determined from a nonlinear regression of (substrate concentration, initial velocity) data pairs fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation using KaleidaGraph 3.08d (Synergy Software). All reactions were performed in 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, at either 25 or 37 °C. Product formation was measured using either a discontinuous assay to monitor the appearance of KDO8P or a continuous coupled assay to monitor the appearance of inorganic phosphate (23Sheflyan G.Y. Howe D.L. Wilson T.L. Woodard R.W. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 11027-11032Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In the discontinuous assay, buffer, PEP, and A5P were incubated for 3 min at the desired temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 5-μl aliquot of enzyme (150–450 ng of P145S KDO8P synthase) for a final volume of 50 μl. After 3 min the reaction was quenched by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid (50 μl) and assayed using the periodate-thiobarbituric acid assay as described earlier. In the continuous assay, buffer, PEP, 7-methylinosine (250 μm), P145S KDO8P synthase (180–360 ng), and purine nucleoside phosphorylase (10 μg) were incubated for 3 min at the desired temperature. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a 10-μl aliquot of A5P for a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was vortexed, transferred to a temperature equilibrated cuvette, and data recorded at 280 nm for 2 min in 1-s intervals. The initial rate was determined from a linear fit to the change in absorbance over this time. For an experiment measuring the kinetic parameters for A5P, the initial concentration of PEP was 20×K m, and the initial concentration of A5P ranged from 0.25× K m to 6× K m. The extent of reaction of A5P was <10% at all substrate concentrations. The relative concentrations of PEP and A5P were reversed to measure the parameters for PEP. Size exclusion chromatography was performed at ambient temperature on a Superose 12 (10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was equilibrated at 0.5 ml/min with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4; 100-μl aliquots of enzyme (75 μg) were applied under identical conditions. The column was calibrated with a Sigma MW-GF-200 Molecular Weight Marker Kit, 12–200-kDa range. Separations were achieved using a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PhastSystem with 8–25% gradient gels and native buffer strips according to the manufacturer's instructions. The gels were silver stained (PhastSystem kit) and then quantitated using a Personal Densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Growth curves forS. typhimurium AG701 and AG701i50 were generated at temperatures of 30 and 37 °C to verify their temperature sensitivity. The doubling time for AG701i50 is only slightly increased at 30 °C as compared with AG701 (Fig.3 A), but AG701i50 growth is severely retarded at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B). The addition of exogenous A5P does not rescue the growth of AG701i50 at either temperature. AG701i50 growth can be partially restored by complementation with pT7-7-kdsA-701, which encodes KDO8P synthase from strain AG701. Transformation with pT7-7 confers antibiotic resistance to AG701i50 but has no effect on its growth characteristics. When this project was initiated little genomic sequence data for a strain ofS. typhimurium was available. There did exist, however, a series of contigs for Salmonella typhi CT18, generated by the The Sanger Center, Cambridge, UK. A tblastn search (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68306) Google Scholar) of this sequence space using E. coli K12 KDO8P synthase located an open reading frame encoding for a protein with 93% amino acid identity. This nucleotide sequence was assumed to be thekdsA gene for S. typhi CT18 and was used as a basis for the design of cloning primers for S. typhimuriumAG701 and AG701i50. A polymerase chain reaction with these primers andS. typhimurium AG701 or AG701i50 genomic DNA produced a single product of the expected size (892 base pairs), which was then cloned into pT7-7 to yield pT7-7-kdsA-701 or pT7-7-kdsA-701i50, respectively. Sequencing of the inserted DNA fragment reveals differences in 12 of 802 nucleotides (region independent of cloning primers) between S. typhi CT18 kdsA and S. typhimurium AG701 kdsA. The proteins encoded by these sequences, however, are identical in primary sequence. This leads us to believe that although the polymerase chain reaction products described above may have mutations at the nucleotide level in the regions arising from the cloning primers, the proteins expressed with this system are authentic KDO8P synthase from S. typhimurium AG701 and AG701i50. 2Preliminary sequence data for S. typhimurium LT2 are now available from the Washington University Genome Sequencing Center, St. Louis, MO. A blastn search (25Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68306) Google Scholar) of this sequence space using the sequence for S. typhimurium AG 701 kdsA, including the primer regions based on the S. typhi CT18 database, returns a sequence with 100% identity. The sequence data for kdsA from S. typhimuriumAG701 and AG701i50 reveals a single nucleotide difference between the gene from the two strains, resulting in a proline (CCG) to serine (TCG) point mutation at position 145. An amino acid sequence comparison reveals that this proline is conserved among KDO8P synthases from a number of organisms, suggesting that it is important for correct expression of enzymatic activity. In the following discussion KDO8P synthase from strain AG701 is referred to as wild-type enzyme and that from strain AG701i50 is referred to as P145S mutant enzyme. Both wild-type and P145S KDO8P synthase from S. typhimurium were successfully purified according to a procedure similar to that previously reported for KDO8P synthase from E. coli (14Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The wild-type enzyme has no metal ion requirement and synthesizes KDO8P from A5P and PEP (verified by 1H NMR). The specific activity of both wild-type and P145S enzyme was determined at several temperatures (Fig.4). In the presence of 1 mmA5P and 1 mm PEP the wild-type enzyme displays an exponential dependence on temperature, with an Arrhenius factor of 23.0 ± 0.5 kcal/mol. The P145S enzyme has reduced activity (∼35% of wild-type) and a nearly identical Arrhenius factor (23 ± 2 kcal/mol) between 15 and 30 °C. Above 30 °C the activity of this enzyme decreases dramatically. Increasing the level of each substrate to 5 mm has no effect on the wild-type enzyme, but the activity of the P145S enzyme now parallels that of the wild-type up to 35 °C, where it remains constant. The thermal stability of both wild-type and P145S KDO8P synthase was examined at 37 °C. In the absence of substrates, the wild-type enzyme retains full activity over the course of a 1-h incubation. The specific activity of the P145S enzyme is reduced by approximately 50% under identical conditions. Shifting the heated P145S enzyme to 4 °C for 1 h does not restore enzymatic activity. In the presence of 500 μm PEP, however, the P145S enzyme retains full activity when incubated at 37 °C. The inclusion of 500 μm A5P with the P145S enzyme does not have a stabilizing effect. The wild-type enzyme is not effected by the addition of either A5P or PEP. The steady state kinetic parameters for both wild-type and P145S KDO8P synthase at 25 and 37 °C are reported in TableI. The values for the wild-type enzyme at 37 °C are similar to those for the E. coli enzyme (26Sheflyan G.Y. Chen G. Duewel H. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14320-14329Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The K m values for both substrates are elevated in the P145S enzyme as compared with the wild-type enzyme, with a 3-fold increase in K m for A5P and a 90-fold increase inK m for PEP at 25 °C. The differences inK m are even larger at 37 °C, with increases of 30- and 390-fold for A5P and PEP, respectively. Thek cat values for the P145S enzyme are approximately 30–40% that of the wild-type enzyme at both temperatures.Table IKinetic parameters for KDO8P synthaseParameterWild-type enzymeP145S enzyme25 °C37 °C25 °C37 °CK m(A5P)4.4 ± 0.2 μm9.3 ± 0.6 μm14 ± 1 μm280 ± 20 μmK m (PEP)2.8 ± 0.1 μm4.2 ± 0.2 μm260 ± 20 μm1650 ± 70 μmk cat (A5P)1.75 ± 0.04 s−15.6 ± 0.2 s−10.74 ± 0.01 s−11.63 ± 0.04 s−1k cat (PEP)2.08 ± 0.07 s−16.7 ± 0.5 s−10.72 ± 0.02 s−12.02 ± 0.06 s−1Parameters for the wild-type enzyme were determined from progress curve analysis of PEP disappearance.

Those for the P145S enzyme were determined from analysis of the initial rates of product formation. Errors represent the S.D. of three to eight experiments. The variable substrate in each experiment is shown in parentheses. The apparent molecular masses of both wild-type and mutant enzymes were determined by size exclusion chromatography. The wild-type enzyme migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 97 ± 2 kDa, for an oligomeric state of 3.1 monomers per oligomer. The P145S enzyme migrates as two poorly resolved peaks, having apparent molecular masses of 91 ± 2 and 53 ± 1 kDa. These masses indicate a structure of 2.9 monomers per oligomer and 1.7 monomers per oligomer, respectively. This phenomenon was further investigated by determining the electrophoretic mobility of both wild-type and mutant enzyme under non-denaturing conditions (native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) at 15, 25, and 35 °C. The wild-type enzyme migrates as a single, well resolved band at each temperature. The P145S enzyme migrates as two species at both 15 and 25 °C, a fairly well resolved high molecular weight band and an asymmetric low molecular weight band that tails toward the low molecular weight side, with approximately 30% of the enzyme migrating as the high molecular weight species. At 35 °C the high molecular weight fraction of the P145S enzyme is barely discernible, and the low molecular weight band exhibits considerable smearing on the low molecular weight side. The temperature-sensitive nature of S. typhimuriumAG701i50 was verified by recording its growth characteristics at two different temperatures (Fig. 3). In contrast to the characterization of the temperature-sensitive strain of S. typhimurium described by Rick and Osborn (6Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we were unable to rescue strain AG701i50 using exogenous A5P. Growth can be partially restored, however, by complementation with a plasmid encoding for wild-type KDO8P synthase. Although the KDO8P synthase gene in this plasmid is downstream from a T7 promoter, low levels of expression from similar plasmids have been achieved by E. coli RNA polymerase (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5981) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence homology between E. coli and S. typhimurium RNA polymerase ς70 (>90% identity) suggests that expression can also be achieved in AG701i50. In an attempt to correlate the temperature-sensitive growth reported above with a defect in KDO8P synthase, the specific activity of each enzyme was measured as a function of temperature (Fig. 4). There are three possibilities that may explain the decrease in activity of the P145S enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme with increasing temperature as follows: a relative decrease ink cat, a relative increase inK m, or a decrease in the amount of active enzyme. The latter possibility was investigated by measuring the thermal stability of the P145S enzyme at 37 °C. Although this enzyme is less stable than wild-type in the absence of substrates, the addition of as little as 500 μm PEP fully protects P145S KDO8P synthase against thermally induced inactivation. As the activity data shown in Fig. 4 was measured in the presence of either 1 or 5 mmPEP, it is unlikely that the decreased activity for the P145S enzyme results from a change in the fraction of active enzyme. To differentiate between the remaining possibilities, we measuredk cat and K m at 25 and 37 °C (Table I). The k cat values for the wild-type enzyme are what one would expect based on the data in Fig. 4, both in terms of their magnitude and temperature dependence. Thek cat values for the P145S enzyme are lower than those for wild-type at 25 °C and show only a slight relative decrease upon shifting to 37 °C. The K m values for both substrates with the P145S enzyme are elevated at 25 °C and increase dramatically relative to wild-type at 37 °C. These results are consistent with the ability of increasing levels of substrate to restore activity to the P145S enzyme at 35 °C (Fig. 4) and suggest that an elevated K m is largely responsible for the observed temperature dependence. Although an increase inK m for A5P is not unexpected based on the work reported by Rick and Osborn (6Rick P.D. Osborn M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3756-3760Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we were surprised to find such a dramatic reduction in the binding of PEP. This may explain why A5P alone is not sufficient to rescue the growth of AG701i50. To investigate whether Pro-145 plays a structural role in KDO8P synthase, we determined the oligomeric state of both wild-type and P145S enzyme. The wild-type enzyme behaves much like the E. coli enzyme; both migrate as an apparent trimer during size exclusion chromatography (28Duewel H.S. Sheflyan G.Y. Woodard R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The P145S enzyme migrates as two species, an apparent trimer and a lower molecular weight species intermediate between a dimer and a monomer. This result was confirmed using native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; at both 15 and 25 °C the wild-type enzyme appears as a single band, whereas the P145S enzyme resolves into two distinct species. The fraction of P145S enzyme that migrates as the high molecular weight species (∼30%) is remarkably similar to the ratio of P145S to wild-type specific activity at these temperatures (∼35%, Fig. 4) as well as to the ratio ofk cat values (30–40%, Table I). This suggests that the majority of enzymatic activity is associated with the high molecular weight species, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the low molecular weight species has some residual activity. This hypothesis is further supported by the following two observations: 1) in the absence of substrates, the P145S enzyme progressively loses activity upon incubation at 37 °C, and 2) when electrophoresed at 35 °C the majority of the P145S enzyme is found as the low molecular weight species. The correlation between loss of activity and change in oligomerization state suggests that full expression of enzymatic activity is only achieved in correctly formed oligomers. As no activity is regained upon shifting the P145S enzyme to 4 °C following incubation at 37 °C in the absence of substrates, we conclude that these two species are not in dynamic equilibrium but that conversion from the high molecular weight form to the low molecular weight form of the enzyme is an essentially irreversible process. Although the ratio of high molecular weight species to low molecular weight species observed here may not reflect the in vivo distribution of states, and may in fact be an artifact of overexpression and purification, it is clear that this problem occurs only for KDO8P synthase from the temperature-sensitive strain. Thus the possibility that incorrectly formed oligomers with reduced activity contribute to the restricted growth at elevated temperatures cannot be excluded. During the course of this work a 2.4-Å resolution crystallographic structure of E. coli KDO8P synthase became available (17Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The high level of sequence identity between the S. typhimurium and E. coli enzymes (93%), as well as their similar kinetic behavior and gel filtration mobility, suggests that their three-dimensional structures will also be highly similar. This allows us to interpret the solution chemistry results reported above in terms of this new structural information. Although the size exclusion chromatography results suggest that KDO8P synthase is a trimer, the crystal structure shows it to be a tetramer and reveals the interactions that define the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Recent electrospray ionization mass spectrometry experiments also show theE. coli enzyme to be a tetramer in solution. 3J. Loo, personal communication. The altered oligomeric state of the P145S mutant along with the conserved nature of Pro-145 in KDO8P synthase suggests that Pro-145 is required for correct assembly of the active form of KDO8P synthase. This hypothesis is borne out by the crystal structure, which shows that Pro-145 forms a type III turn between sheet S5 and helix H5. Tetramer assembly is determined, in part, by interactions between helix H5 from one subunit and loop L2 from an adjacent subunit (Fig. 5). Disruption of these contacts is likely to result in a decrease in the number of properly formed oligomers. The altered K m values for the P145S enzyme can also be rationalized through examination of the structure of KDO8P synthase. The crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme was solved with two bound sulfate ions: SO4-1 is thought to occupy the phosphate-binding site for PEP, whereas SO4-2 is thought to occupy the phosphate-binding site for A5P. The SO4-1-binding site is determined in part by Lys-138 (17Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), which forms a 2.8-Å hydrogen bond with SO4-1 and is positioned by sheet S5 (Fig. 6). The highly elevated K m for PEP with the P145S mutant suggests that the binding energy provided by Lys-138 is largely lost in the mutant enzyme. This may be caused by a disruption in the placement of sheet S5 due to the inability of the mutant enzyme to form the correct turn between sheet S5 and helix H5. The interactions described above between helix H5 and loop L2 also provide an explanation for the increased K m for A5P. The binding of SO4-2 is determined by the side chain of Arg-63 and by the side chain and backbone amide of Ser-64 (Fig. 6), both of which are contributed to the active site by loop L2 (17Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The loss of proper contacts between helix H5 and loop L2 may result in non-optimal positioning of loop L2, leading to reduced affinity for A5P. The experiments described above represent the first detailed investigation of an altered KDO8P synthase from a temperature-dependent strain of S. typhimurium. A single point mutation of proline to serine leads to a decrease in substrate binding for both A5P and PEP, as well as to reduced thermal stability in the absence of substrates. Whether these changes act singly or in concert to achieve the observed phenotype is unknown. Although many attempts at drug design are focused on identifying compounds that bind in place of natural substrates, these results suggest that the disruption of correct oligomer formation may also be a viable therapeutic target. This work also points out the value of re-evaluating previous results in the light of currently available experimental techniques. Our interest in the history of KDO8P synthase led us to explore more fully the cause of reduced activity in S. typhimurium mutants, and to apply advances in cloning and protein overexpression to answer questions first raised more then 25 years ago. We thank Dr. Werner Brabetz for kindly providing us with the strains of S. typhimurium."
https://openalex.org/W2006378059,"Bidirectional transport of proteins via the Sec61p translocon across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane is a recognized component of the ER quality control machinery. Following translocation and engagement by the luminal quality control system, misfolded and unassembled proteins are exported from the ER lumen back to the cytosol for degradation by the proteasome. Additionally, other ER contents, including oligosaccharides, oligopeptides, and glycopeptides, are efficiently exported from mammalian and yeast systems, indicating that bidirectional transport across ER membranes is a general eukaryotic phenomenon. Glycopeptide and protein export from the ER in in vitro systems is both ATP- and cytosol-dependent. Using a well established system to study glycopeptide export and conventional liquid chromatography, we isolated a single polypeptide species of 23 kDa from rat liver cytosol that was capable of fully supporting glycopeptide export from rat microsomes in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system. The protein was identified by mass spectrometric sequence analysis as guanylate kinase (GK), a housekeeping enzyme critical in the regulation of cellular GTP levels. We confirmed the ability of GK to substitute for complete cytosol by reconstitution of glycopeptide export from rat liver microsomes using highly purified recombinant GK from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most significantly, we found that the GK (and hence the cytosolic component) requirement was fully bypassed by low micromolar concentrations of GDP or GTP. Similarly, export was inhibited by non-hydrolyzable analogues of GDP and GTP, indicating a requirement for GTP hydrolysis. Membrane integrity was fully maintained under assay conditions, as no ER luminal proteins were released. Competence for glycopeptide export was abolished by very mild protease treatment of microsomes, indicating the presence of an essential protein on the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. These data demonstrate that export of glycopeptide export is controlled by a microsomal GTPase and is independent of cytosolic protein factors."
